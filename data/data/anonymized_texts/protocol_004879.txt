commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . Qualified s ubjects will return to the investigational site for  Day -1. Subjects should have 
fasted for at least 10 hours  prior to the safety laboratory ass essments. After confirmation of 
eligibility, subjects will be enrolled. All subjects that are not enrolled will be considered as 
screen failures.  
At Day -1, enrolled subjects will perform a product test using P4M3 Gen  2.0 Classic Auburn 
3.5% variant ad lib itum for up to 10 minutes. After the product test, subjects not willing 
and/or not ready to use P4M3 Gen  2.0 during the study will be discontinued from the study, 
will enter the 3-day Safety Follow -up and will be replaced.  
Subjects willing and ready to use 2 variants of P4M3 Gen  2.0 during the study  after product 
test will start their confinement period of 3 days.  The brand of subjects’ cigarettes will be 
recorded.   
36 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 6 possible sequences  of product use on Day 1 to Day 
3 (see Figure 1). 
On Day 1 to Day 3 , after at least 12 hours of abstinence from any nicotine/tobacco containing 
products (nicotine wash -out), subjects will smoke a cigarette  or use a variant of P4M3 
according to randomized product use sequence ad libitum for 6 minutes  (± 30 seconds) . The 
weight of each  P4M3 Gen  2.0 Cartridge will be determined  before and after product use to 
estimate the amount of nicotine delivered in the aerosol during the 6 minutes ad libitum  use 
period . Subjects will use a single variant of P4M3 Gen  2.0 with the MDEDR  puffing 
topography device connected with data recording ad libitum  for 6 minutes  (± 30 seconds) .  
Subjects will complete questionnaires about product evaluation, craving and liking 
assessments .  
The start of product use of the 6 minutes ad libitum  use period will be defined as T 0. T0 on 
Day 1 to Day 3 should be at approximately the same time in the morning, within a window 
of ± 20 minutes. Venous blood samples will be obtained according to the standard operating 
procedures (SOPs) at the investigational site.  
On Day 1, 15 blood samples will be collecte d for determination of nicotine concentration at 
the following time points in relation to T 0 with a time window as indicated in brackets:  
Prior to T 0: 
• T-1: 5 minutes (± 1 minute )  
After T 0: 
• T1 after 1 minute (+ 30 seconds )

The entire stud y per subject will last up to  34 days. This will include a screening period of 
up to 28 days  prior  to Admission (Day -29 to Day -2), 3 days of confinement ( after 
enrollment on Day -1 to time of discharge on Day 3, (3 overnight stays ), and a 3-day Safety 
Follow -Up (from time of Discharge at Day 3 until Day 6). The end of the study (EOS) for a 
subject is defined as the end of  the Safety Follow -up Period. The end of the whole study 
corresponds to the individual EOS of the last subject.  
Statistical Methods:  
Demographics and baseline characteristics  will be analyzed on the randomized and PK 
populations.  
PK, PD, HPT and extent of  product use endpoints  will be analyzed on the randomized and 
the PK population.  
Safety will be analyzed using the safety population.  
Nicotine PK endpoints will be derived from the background -corrected plasma nicotine 
concentrations.  Nicotine PK parameters will be derived from background -corrected plasma 
nicotine concentration versus time data using a non -compartmental analysis (NCA) 
technique.  
All data will be presented in listings, ordered by subject, study visit, product and time po int, 
unless otherwise specified.  
All endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics including number of subjects 
(n), number and percent of subjects with missing data, arithmetic means , and standard 
deviations (mean and SD), median, first and th ird quartiles, minimum and maximum.  
For log normally distributed endpoints, geometric mean, geometric CV and geometric CI 
will be presented in addition.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency statistics (number and percentage).  
For endpoints relating to sampling times (e.g., T max), only median, first and third quartiles, 
and minimum and maximum will be presented.  
All analyses and summaries will be performed by product.  
A mixed model  analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on A UC 0-2min, AUC 0-4min, 
AUC 0-Tmax, AUC 0-10h, AUC 0-last, AUC 0-infinity,  max(Ct/t)t∈]0,Tmax]  and C max endpoints in the 
natural logarithmic scale. The results of this analysis will be presented in terms of geometric 
least square mean  ratios  and 95% confidence intervals  (95% CI ) for the P4M3 Gen  2.0: 
cigarettes ratio  and the ratios of variants of P4M3 Gen  2.0.

1.1 Independent Review Board (IRB) Approval  
Prior to the start of the study, the clinical study protocol, together with its associated documents 
(informed consent form [ICF] including the subject information sheet, subject recruitment 
procedures [e .g., advertisements], written information to be provided to the subjects, 
Investigator’s brochure [IB], available safety information, curriculum vitae of the 
Investigator(s) and designee(s) and/or other evidence of qualifications and any other 
documents re quested by an Institutional Review Board [IRB]), will be submitted for review 
and approval to the relevant IRB according to the appropriate provisions found in 21 Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) part 50 (“Informed Consent of Human Subjects”) and 21 CFR p art 
56 (“Institutional Review Boards”). The IRB shall be appropriately constituted and perform its 
functions in accordance with the International Council for Harmonization of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Guidance for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) [1] and local requirements,  as applicable.  
In accordance with GCP and 21 CFR part 56, a written confirmation of the IRB approval 
should be provided to the Sponsor. This should identify the study (name of the Investigator (s) 
and designee(s), study number, and title) and the documents  that have been approved by the 
IRB, with dates and version numbers, as well as the date of approval. The composition of the 
IRB, including the name and occupation of the chairperson, will be supplied to the Sponsor 
together with a GCP compliance statement . 
The written approval from the IRB will be filed in the Investigator file, and a copy will be filed 
in the study master file at the Sponsor or designated organization. The study must not start at 
a site before the Sponsor has obtained written confirmation  of favorable opinion/approval from 
the concerned IRB.  
Any change or addition to this protocol will require a written protocol amendment that must

2.1 Background  
2.1.1  Smoking -Related Diseases and Harm Reduction Strategy  
Cigarette smoking causes pulmonary, cardiovascular and other serious diseases in smokers [3]. 
There is no safe cigarette, and the best way for smokers to reduce the adverse health 
consequences of smoking is to quit. Despite the risks which are attributable to smoking, some 
smokers decide to continue smoking. The development of novel tobacco and nicotine 
containing products with the potential to be less harmful than cigarettes represents an approach 
to reduce cigarette -related deaths and diseases among smokers who would have otherwise 
continued smoking [4]. Philip Morris Products S.A. (PMP) is developing such alternative 
products that have the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison 
to smoking cigarettes. These products aim to  substantially reduce or eliminate the exposure to 
harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs)  generated from cigarette  smoke , with 
the exception of nicotine, while providing an acceptable substitute for cigarettes.  
One of these products is P4M3 G en 2.0, which is an electronic nicotine delivery system 
(ENDS)  or electronic cigarette  (e-cigarette) . The liquid  used in P4M3 Gen  2.0 is composed of 
propylene glycol, vegetable glycerol, water, nicotine, lactic acid , benzoic acid  and flavors.  
E-cigarettes have the potential to benefit adult smokers who are not pregnant if used as a 
complete substitute for combustible tobacco containing products such as  cigarettes. However,  
in some particular conditions of  e-cigarettes use, harm has been recentl y reported . In a recent 
investigation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have analyzed national 
data on e -cigarette, or vaping, product use -associated lung injury. CDC and FDA recommend 
that people should not use Tetrahydrocannabinol (TH C)-containing e -cigarette, or vaping, 
products, particularly from informal sources like friends, family, or in -person or online sellers. 
Vitamin E acetate should not be added to e -cigarette, or vaping, products, or any other 
substances not intended by the manufacturer.  
CDC, FDA, and state health authorities have made progress in identifying substances of 
concern in e-cigarettes or vaping products . However, there are many different substances and 
product sources that remain under investigation, and there ma y be more than one cause.  
Given that context, when developing new product s such as P4M3 Gen  2.0, appropriate 
assessment including comprehensive understanding o f product characterization , its safety,  and 
related impact of product use in human s is critical . P4M3 Gen  2.0 is a close d e-cigarette  with 
a Cartridge that cannot  be refilled and for which  the e-liquid does not contain THC or Vitamin 
E acetate  (section 2.1.2 ).

commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . 2.1.2  Description of the Product and Scientific Findings  
P4M3 Gen  2.0 is an Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS ) that produces an aerosol 
through vaporization of an e -liquid. The e -liquid i s composed of propylene glycol (PG), 
vegetable glycerol (VG), water, nicotine, lactic acid, benzoic acid and flavors . P4M3 Gen  2.0 
is a closed e -cigarette composed of a Battery unit containing all the electronics with a 
rechargeable battery and a disposabl e, replaceable Cartridge containing the e -liquid and the 
heating element. The P4M3 Gen  2.0 Cartridge is not refillable.  
The aerosol production (heating cycle) is trigg ered by a pressure sensor in the Battery unit 
when a puff is detected. The e -liquid aeros ol is produced by a heater of a fine mesh  of stainless -
steel wires heated by an electric current.  
The aerosol generated by P4M3 Gen  2.0 is free from the majority of HPHCs associated with 
heating or burning tobacco, except nicotine. P4M3 Gen  2.0 does not contain tobacco and there 
is no combustion during use.  
The non -clinical assessment is d escribed in the Investigator’s B rochure and supports the 
clinical assessment of P4M3 Gen  2.0 [5]. P4M3 Gen  2.0 has n ot been tested in humans before.  
In 2016, FDA finalized a rule extending its Center for Tobacco products’ (CTP's) regulatory 
authority to cover all tobacco products, including  ENDS that meet the definition of a tobacco 
product. FDA regulates the manufactur e, import, packaging, labeling, advertising, promotion, 
sale, and distribution of ENDS, including components and parts of ENDS.  
When assessing ENDS use, significant inter -subject variability has been described for human 
puffing topography (HPT) parameters,  especially puff duration, puff frequency, and flow rate 
[6]. Experienced e -cigarette users may extract more nicotine by puffing with a low flow rate 
and long duration puffs in comparison to cigarette smokers. E -cigarette design features also 
affect nicotine exposure; increasing the battery voltage output and e -liquid nicotine 
conce ntration increases the nicotine delivery [7]. Differences in puffing behavior (such as puff 
duration or depth of inhalation) resulted in a faster absorption rate and a higher amount of 
nicotine absorption in experienced e -cigarette users as compared to naïve e -cigarette users 
when using the same e -cigarette  [8]. Battery output, type of wicks, ventilation holes, and other 
mechanical characteristics of each individual e -cigarette product determine how much aerosol 
and nicotine is released. More effective and appealing e -cigarette products to provide satisfying 
alternatives to smoking has led to e -liquids containing ‘nicotine salts’. Nicotine salts are 
formed by the reaction of nicotine with a suitable acid and are less volatile than freebase 
nicotine [9]. As a result, a greater fraction of the nicotine in the salt form is expecte d to remain 
in inhaled aerosol droplets until the aerosol reaches the alveoli for pulmonary absorption.

Data and information contained in this document are considered to constitute trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . 2.2 Purpose of the Study  
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the nicotine pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of  2 
variants of P4M3 Gen  2.0 versus cigarettes  following a 6 minute s ad libitum  use period. In 
addition, pharmacodynamic effects  (PD), including subjective effects and related behavioral 
assessments , as well as human puffing topography  (HPT)  will be evaluated, to provide further 
insights on P4M3 Gen 2 .0 product acceptance and product use. Safety will be assessed 
throughout the study.  
The aim is to evaluate if P4M3 Gen  2.0 can provide an acceptable alternative to smoking 
cigarettes in term s of both , nicotine delivery and sensorial  satisfaction for smoke rs who would 
otherwise continue smoking cigarettes.  
2.3 Anticipated Benefits and Risks  
2.3.1  Anticipated Benefits  
Information on health risks associated with smoking and smoking cessation advice will be 
provided. Subjects who are motivated to quit smoking or using other nicotine/tobacco -
containing products  during the study will be given the opportunity to continue their smoking 
cessation attempt and will be referred to appropriate stop smoking services for continuing 
support and counselling at a higher level. Subjec ts who participate in this study will also benefit 
from repeated and detailed health check -ups.  
2.3.2  Anticipated Foreseeable Risks due to Study Procedures  
The risk of scheduled procedures in the present study (e.g., blood samples) are deemed to be 
on par with procedures routinely performed during normal or extended health examinations by 
the subject’s healthcare professional. The total volume of blood to be drawn is approximately 
300 mL and does not exceed the levels for a standard blood donation. The risks related to blood 
sampling include for example: excessive bleeding, fainting, hematoma, paresthesia or 
infection, and those related to the total amount of blood taken over a period of time such as 
weakness, dizziness or anemia.  
2.3.3  Anticipated Foreseeable Risks due to Investigational Product  
By product design , the aerosol generated by P4M3 Gen  2.0 is free from the majority of HPHCs 
associated with heating or burning tobacco, except nicotin e. However, given the current state 
of knowledge about the product, it has not yet been demonstrated that P4M3 Gen  2.0 or other 
e-cigarettes reduce the risk of developing smoking -related diseases compared to cigarettes.

Confidentiality Statement  
Data and information contained in this document are considered to constitute trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . Due to sensorial and technological differences between P4M3 Gen  2.0 and cigarettes, it is 
possible that subjects will adapt their behavior, e.g., by modifying the number, the volume 
and/or duration of puffs, as well as the intensity of inhalation.  
The confinement setting may also have an i nfluence on puffing behavior and nicotine uptake . 
An adult smoker using P4M3 Gen  2.0 may experience:  
• Transient nicotine withdrawal symptoms (e.g., urge to smoke, irritability, anxiety 
feelings, restlessness, and difficulty to concentrate) similar to cravin gs observed during 
smoking cessation  
• Transient symptoms suggesting mild nicotine overdose such as stimulatory effects on 
sympathetic tone (increased blood pressure, increased heart rate), central nervous 
system (tremor, blunting of emotions, and decreased ability to concentrate), gastric acid 
secretion, and vomiting. Individuals who experience adverse events (AEs) (suggesting 
excessive stimulant effects) should be instructed to reduce their intensity of product use 
by decreasing the number of puffs and/or t he intensity of puffing  
• Change in smoking habits due to study requirements and related concomitant 
symptoms, e.g., craving  
Support during periods of abstinence from any tobacco and nicotine containing products  will 
be provided.  
Further risk mitigation will  include:  
• Using commonly accepted research and scientific standards (e.g., blood samples not to 
exceed blood donation standards)  
• Medical supervision of all study subjects with follow -up of those who have experienced 
AEs/ serious adverse events (SAEs)  
2.3.4  Unfo reseeable Risks  
The possibility of unforeseeable events/risks will be explained in detail to study subjects. 
Unexpected malfunction of the P4M3 Gen  2.0 may lead to unforeseeable risk. Risk mitigation 
strategies will include close monitoring and medical sup ervision to detect any unforeseeable 
risk or safety signals at the earliest time possible.

will also be used to determine the nicotine baseline concentration prior to T 0 on Day  2 and 
similarly, T14 after T 0 on Day 2 for nicotine baseline concentration prior to T 0 on Day  3.  
On Day 3, 13 blood samples will be collected for determination of nicotine PK after allocated 
product use. The sample T14 after T 0 on Day 3 will not be collected.  
On Day 1 to Day 3, s ubjective effects of liking and craving will be assessed using a VAS (100  
mm going from “strong disliking” to “strong liking” for VAS liking, and from “no craving” to 
“strong craving” for VAS craving ) at the following time points in relation to T 0: 
Prior to T 0 (for VAS  craving assessment only)  
• T-15: within 1 5 minutes prior to T 0 with a time window as indicated in brackets  
After T 0: (for VAS  craving and VAS liking assessment)  
• T1 after 4 minutes (± 1 minute ) 
• T2 after 10 minutes (± 1 minute ) 
• T3 after 15 minutes (± 1 minute ) 
• T4 after 30 minutes (± 2 minutes ) 
• T5 after 1 hour (± 5 minutes ) 
• T6 after 2 hours (± 5 minutes ) 
• T7 after 4 hours (± 5 minutes ) 
• T8 after 10 hours (± 5 minutes ) 
Additional subjective effects will be assessed on Day 1 to Day 3 by the ABOUT -Product 
experience questionnaire  administered within 1 to 2 hours after T 0. 
On Day 2 and 3, additional blood samples will be taken for determination of the nicotine 
concentration to evaluate terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2z) in relation to T 0 from Day 2 at 
the following time points  with a time window as indicated in brackets :

After enrollment at Admission , the use  of any  other  tobacco and nicotine containing products 
different  from the product assigned for 6 minutes ad libitum  use on Day 1 to Day 3, will not 
be allowed. Use of tobacco and nicotine containing products will not be restricted after the 
subject has been discharged from the investigational site  on Day 3.  
After discharge at Day 3, the subjects will enter a 3-day Safety Follow -Up Period (FU Period) 
during which AE/SAEs reported by the subjects will be collected and the follow -up of 
AEs/SAEs  ongoing at d ischarge  will be conducted by the investigational site  (section  8.2.6 ).  
Subjects who will be discontinued from the study before enrolment will be replaced. After 
enrollment but before randomization, subjects who will be discontinued from the study will 
enter the 3 -day Safety Follow -Up Period and will be replaced. However, subjects that are 
discontinued after randomization will not be replaced . 
4.2 Rationale for Study Desi gn  
The minimum age of 2 4 years old in the inclusion criteria was selected based on the legal age 
of smoking in the United States of Ameri ca of 21 years; and to account for the 3 years of 
smoking history.  
The goal of this study is to evaluate  the nicotine absorption profile s and related PK parameters  
from two variants P4M3 Gen  2.0 (CA35 and CM35)  with 3.5% nicotine compared  to 
cigarettes.  
The 6 minutes ad libitum  use allow appropriate comparisons  between  different products and 
smoking a cigarette  similar to  published data  [10-13]. The ad libitum  use will also allow to 
explore effects of product liking on PK parameters.   
Sampling time points  for determination of nicotine concentrations were selected to ensure 
reliable estimation of PK parameters. In particular, frequent sampling during the first 15 
minu tes from T 0 will be performed in order to reliably assess Tmax, which is expected to be 
comparable  to what was observed previously (Tmax range: 7 to 10 minutes  after fixed puffing 
regimen ) with P4M3 Gen 1.0, an earlier developmental version  [5] and for cigarettes (Tmax 
range: ~10 minutes)  [14] and which is compatible with absorption by the pulmonary route.  
Comparing  early AUC values AUC 0-2min, AUC 0-4min, AUC 0-Tmax, and the maximum ratio 
max(Ct/t)t∈]0,Tmax] of the 2 variants P4M3 Gen  2.0 and cigarettes may provide insight into the 
efficiency of nicotine absorption  rate into the blood .

Confidentiality Statement  
Data and information contained in this document are considered to constitute trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . The PK of p lasma nicotine presents a biphasic profile, with a typical rapid initial disposition 
half-life (t 1/2α) of 1.35  hours,  followed by a slower terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2z) of hours 
[15]. To ensure a complete  nicotine washout between each product use, 3 days  without  product  
use (cigarette or P4M3 Gen  2.0) would have been required (~ 5 x terminal elimination t 1/2z). 
Based on nicotine population PK modeling, it was estimated that nicotine enters  in the terminal 
elimination phase with concentrations decreasing with a terminal eli mination rate constant (λ z) 
8 to 10 hours post administration. As a consequence, a minimum of 12 hours ha s been 
established in this study design prior to  T0 on Day 1 and approximately 24 hours prior to T0 on 
Day 2 and Day 3. Background -concentration correc tion will be applied to adjust for carry -over 
effects with adjustment of baseline values to the estimated t 1/2z (or λ z) which will be derived 
from additional blood sampling on Day 2 and Day 3  for each subject.  
The use of estrogen contraceptive is known to accelerate nicotine clearance by 20% to 30% 
compared to women who do not take estrogen contraceptive [16]. Therefore, for the purpose 
of this study, use of hormonal contraception c ontaining estrogens is prohibited. This also 
applies to hormone replacement therapy.  
The activity of CYP2A6 will be measured as this enzyme  drives the metabolism of nicotine 
into cotinine and subsequent metabolites. Nicotine metabolism by CYP2A6 varies be tween 
individuals of the same ethnicity/race and across ethnicity/race due to genetic variations. These 
genetic differences could be associated with reduced/increased nicotine metabolism [14]. 
4.3 Appropriateness of Measurements  
All laboratory measures utilized for this study are validated and are appropriate for the study 
assessments. FTND [17, 18] and ABOUT -Product experience  questionnaires  [19] used in this 
study are validated and previously published or adapted versions of validated questionnaires.   
4.4 Study Duration  
The entire study per subject will last up to  34 days. This will include a screening period of up 
to 28 days prior to Admission (Day -29 to Day -2), 3 days of confinement (after enrol lment on 
Day -1 to time of discharge on Day 3, 3 overnight s tays), and a 3 -day Safety Follow -Up (from 
time of Discharge at Day 3 until Day 6). The end of the study (EOS) for a subject is defined as 
either the Discharge at Day 3, or the date of early termination of the subject, plus 3 days for 
the Safety Follow -up Period. The end of the whole study corresponds to the individual EOS of 
the last subject .

When a subject is discontinued from the study, all early terminati on procedures (section  9.7) 
will be performed unless the subject refuses to perform the assessments  or the procedures have 
already been performed during the study day . Early termination procedures are to be performed 
only for subje cts who have been exposed to P4M3 Gen  2.0. After the date of termination, t he 
subject will enter into the 3-day Safety Follow -Up Period. This applies to all subjects 
independent of the reason of discontinuation (for example, withdrawal of cons ent, or at the 
Investigator’s decision , etc.). 
Subjects must be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent.  
• Any AE/SAE or condition (including clinically significant changes in a laboratory 
parameter), whi ch at the discretion of the Investigator is not compatible  with the 
subject’s continued participation in this study.

6.1 Description of Investigational Products  
P4M3 Gen  2.0 will be provided by the Sponsor.  
The distribution and return of investigational products  will be controlled by qualified and 
appropriately trained investigational site staff . 
6.1.1  Test Product  
P4M3 Gen 2.0 is  an ENDS or electronic cigarette (e -cigarette) , which produces an aerosol 
through vaporization of an e -liquid. P4M3 Gen 2.0  is composed of a Battery unit  containing  
all the  control electronics with the rechargeable battery and a disposable Cartridge  containing 
the e -liquid and the heating element.  The Battery unit comp rises several functions. The device 
provides  electrical power  when required,  which is  activated  by puff detection . The device has 
a “dry mesh detection ” function to prevent overheating w hen the liquid on heater is not 
sufficient .  
The Battery unit is charged  via a USB port. The Battery unit also features a tactile function 
that will operate when the unit is turned on and off and when a puff is taken.  
The Battery unit is controlled through  a single multi -function button used for switching on and 
off and allowing the modification of both the haptic (vibration) and the power level.  
The Cartridge consists of a reservoir for storing the e -liquid, which also acts as the mouthpiece 
and includes t he air flow channels to carry the aerosol from the heater to the user. The Cartridge 
contains the e -liquid, the mesh heater sub -assembly and the porous materials for liquid 
retention and transport from the reservoir to the heater. The Cartridge is disposed  of when the 
e-liquid in the reservoir is depleted.  
The P4M3 Gen 2.0 e -liquid formulation s are composed of propylene glycol ( PG), vegeta ble 
glyce rin (VG), water, tobacco -derived nicotine, lactic acid , benzoic acid and could differ in 
flavors  and nicotine concentrations . The following P4M3 Gen 2.0 e -liquid formulations 
(variants) will be investigated  in this study (Table 1).

6.6 Restrictions  
6.6.1   Smoking Restrictions  
During the Screening period, subjects will be allowe d to use any nicotine/tobacco -containing 
products according to their usual habits except during the procedures of the Screening Visit 
(section  9.1). Spirometry assessments at Screening and at Day -1 will be performed 1 hour 
after stopping smoking (section 9.1 and 9.2). 
From Admission  (Day -1) to Discharge (Day 3)  or early termination, use of any 
nicotine/ tobacco containing products, except  use as per study design of the allocated product 
will not be permitted.  
A nicotine washout period of at least 12  hours should be respected before product use at Day 
1 to Day 3. 
6.6.2  Dietary Restrictions  
A standard diet will be designed for the whole confinemen t period. For each meal, the caloric 
and fat content should be controlled to avoid a “high -fat” diet. The FDA guidance on food -
effect studies for bioequivalence  testing identifies a “high -fat” diet as a diet which contains 
“approximately 50 percent of tota l caloric content of the meal [from fat] and is high in calories 
(approximately 800 to 1000 calories) [20].”

7.7.1  Blood Samples   
Blood samples will be drawn by qualified and trained site personnel  and according to the 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) at the investigational site.  
Since the test for nicotine concentration is highly sensitive, precautions should be taken during 
blood sampling and processing to prevent the contamination of samples with environmental 
nicotine.  
In total, approximately  300 mL of blood will be collected for this study including samples for 
determination of plasma  nicotine concentrations ( approximately 230 mL), CYP2A6 activity ( 5 
mL), serology (5  mL) and safety laboratory (approximately 6 0 mL). This calculation is based 
on an individ ual volume of each sample of 5.0 mL for nicotine PK, 5.0 mL for CYP2A6 
analysis, 5 mL for serology, 20 mL per safety laboratory assessments. The total volume of 
blood drawn will not exceed the levels for a standard blood donation.   
Details on the  procedures for collection, labeling, handling and shipment of samples are

Human puffing topography (HPT)  involves the measurement of each subject’s unique way of 
using P4M3 Gen  2.0 or smoking cigarettes .  
The MDEDR puffing topography device  measures and records the flow rate and other per -puff 
parameters listed in  Appendix D . From the per -puff parameters, per -product experience 
parameters, representing average or total values per product, will be derived ( Appendix D ). 
The MDEDR puffing topography device  will be used with the P4M3 Gen 2.0 on Day 1 to Day 
3 with data recording during  6 minutes (±30 seconds)  ad libitum  use as described in the 
Schedule of events . Data will be not be collected during cigarette smoking . 
The P4M3 Gen 2.0 device is equipped with a pressure sensor, which measures the pressure at 
the Cartridge level. When a puff is drawn, the P4M3 Gen 2.0 calculates the difference  of 
pressure between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure measured at the Cartridge level. 
The aerosol production (heating cycle) is then triggered based on the difference of pressure 
values calculated by the device. The MDEDR puffing topography devic e is mechanically 
attached to the Battery unit of P4M3 Gen 2.0 and electronically connected to its USB port. The 
MDEDR puffing topography device works as a data logger. Once connected to the P4M3 Gen 
2.0 device, the MDEDR puffing topography device is able to record HPT  data. Any 
malfunction of the MDEDR  puffing topography device  will be documented in the appropriate 
log.  
One MDEDR puffing topography device will be assigned at Day -1 for each subject and will 
be used for all further HPT assessments. A repla cement device will be provided in case of 
malfunction of the device assigned. The Sponsor will provide training on the use of the 
MDEDR puffing topography device to the investigational site staff which will be responsible 
for the HPT assessment. All MDEDR puffing topography devices will be returned to the 
Sponsor after completion of the study.  
Prior to calculation of the per -product experience parameters, the Sponsor’s HPT group will 
process, validate and discard any invalid data, as per the Sponsor’s SOPs. The Sponsor will

for the per -puff and per -product use experience parameters will be part of the study database 
and will be analyzed.  
7.8.3  Weighing of P4M3 Gen  2.0 Cartridge  
P4M3 Gen  2.0 Cartridges will be weighed before T 0 and within 120 min after T 0 as described 
in the Schedule of events to estimate the amount of nicotine delivered during product use .  
The weight will be determined with a scale with an accuracy of 1 mg.  
7.9 Questionnaires  
The questionnaires will be asked to the subject as described in the Sch edule of events  
(Appendix A) and will be completed by the subjects. All subject -reported outcome as well as 
instructions will be provided in the subject’s local language.  
7.9.1  Fage rström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND, Revised Version)  
At the Screening visit, potential nicotine dependence will be assessed as per Schedule of Event  
using the FTND in its revised version [18] as updated in 2012 [26]. 
The questionnaire consists of six questions which have to be answered by the subject 
himself/herself. The scores obtained on the test permit the classification of nicotin e dependence 
into three levels: Mild (0 to 3 points); Moderate (4 to 6 points); Severe (7 -10 points) [26]. 
7.9.2  Nicotine/Tobacco Product Use History  
At the Screening Visit, subjects will be asked questions about their tobacco -and/or nicotine -
containing products use history. The questions will capture frequency and quantity of tobacco 
and/or nicotine -containing product use over the past 4 weeks, and number of continuous years 
of cigarette smoking. This information will be used as characteristics of the study subjects and 
to assess their eligibility to participate in the study.  
7.9.3  ABOUT -Product Experience Questionnaire  
Product experience  will be assessed via a subject self -reported outcome measure, part of the 
ABOUT toolbox [27, 28] .  
The questionnaire consists of 3 multi -item scales and 2 single -item scales, arising from an 
adaptation and rewording of  the modified cigarette evaluation questionnaire (mCEQ) [19] to 
RRPs and the Product Evaluation Scale [29].

commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . The questionnaire assesses the degree to which subjects experience the reinforcing effects of 
P4M3 Gen  2.0 with CA35 and CM 35 Cartridges use by measuring:  
• Product satisfaction (satisfy ing, tastes good, enjoy the product).  
• Psychological rewards (calms down, more awake, less irritable, helps concentrate, 
reduces hunger).  
• Aversion (dizziness, nausea).  
• Enjoyment of respiratory tract sensations (single -item assessment).  
• Craving reduction (single -item assessment).  
Subjects will be asked to assess the items of the questionnaire on a 7 -point scale, ranging from 
“not at all” to “extremely”.  
7.9.4  VAS Craving Assessment  
Cigarette craving will be assessed using a 1 item self -reported craving VAS [30], asking 
subjects to rate craving for cigarettes  (How strong is your craving for cigarettes ?), on a 100  
mm unipolar scale, ranging from 0 (no craving), to 100 (strong craving).  
7.9.5  VAS Liking Assessment  
Cigarette and P4M3 Gen 2.0 liking will be assessed using a one item self -reported liking VAS, 
asking sub jects to rate liking for product (At this moment, my liking for this product is:)  on a 
100 mm bipolar scale, ranging from 0 (strong disliking), to 100 (strong liking), with a neutral 
middle point, as recommended in the FDA guidance for industry on abuse lia bility assessment  
[31].

8.1 Definition s 
8.1.1  Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any health -related event which is adverse or unfavorable 
and which either starts after ICF signature or represents a worsening of a health –related 
condition that existed at the time of that signature. Careful medical judgment is required to 
establish wh ether a clinical finding (including an abnormal laboratory result) is a true AE or 
just a manifestation of a preexisting health –related condition. An AE may or may not have a 
causal relationship with the study procedures or with the use of investigational product.  
8.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that:  
• results in death,  
• is life -threatening,  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
• results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity,  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
• is an important medical event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate Investigator’s me dical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or the subject may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definitions.  
"Life -threatening" means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the ev ent. It 
might have caused death if it had occurred in a more serious form.  
8.1.3  Conditions Existent Before the Start of the Period of Collection (ICF 
Signature)  
Clinical conditions that existed before the start of the period of collection of AEs and are still 
ongoing at Screening (concomitant disease), and whose severity remained unchanged after that 
point, should not be considered AEs and should not be captured as such. This includes medical 
therapies or surgical interventions that had been planned befor e the start of the period of

Confidentiality Statement  
Data and information contained in this document are considered to constitute trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . collection regardless of involving admissions to hospital, if the medical condition to be 
addressed did not get worse after the start of the collection period. Otherwise, any medical 
condition that existed before the start of t he period of collection and still ongoing at Screening 
(concomitant disease) and whose severity increased after that point is to be captured as an AE 
or SAE, depending on the seriousness criteria met.  
8.2 Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events  
8.2.1  Collection of Information  
AEs should be collected mainly via face -to-face interview with the subject by the use of 
consistent, open, non -directive questions from the investigator(s) or designee(s) (e.g., “How 
have you been feeling since you were last asked?”).  
Any no n-serious AE occurrence during the study must be documented in the subject’s medical 
records in accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE page of 
the CRF. SAEs that occur during the study must be documented in the subject’s medical record, 
on the AE CRF, and on the SAE form.  
Information recorded will include: verbatim description of the AE/SAE , start and stop dates 
and times,  seriousness, severity (intensity), action taken ( e.g., whether or not the AE/SAE led 
to the subject’ s discontinuation from the study), and outcome ( e.g., resolved, stabilized ,).  
Information to be recorded about an AE/SAE should include, whenever possible, onset and 
resolution dates and times, circumstances leading up to the event, clinical elements such  as 
clinical course, specific vital signs and test results that may explain the pathophysiology of the 
event, as well as alternative explanations to its occurrence.  
Whenever a medically meaningful diagnosis is available to comprise a set of reported signs  
and/or symptoms, it should be preferentially provided as the AE or SAE term, rather than the 
individual signs and/or symptoms. Otherwise, each one of those signs and/or symptoms should 
be reported separately as event terms.  
8.2.2  Period of Collection  
AEs (inclu ding SAEs) will be collected from the time of ICF signature until the individual 
EOS  for each participant . 
Any AEs which occur during the screening period will be captured by the investigational site 
staff and assessed by the Investigator or designee(s) in  order to establish relationship to study 
procedures.  
During a 3-day Safety Follow -Up Period new AEs/SAEs will be recorded and ongoing 
AEs/SAEs will be followed -up by the study site. In general, AEs will be followed -up until

has been found and until the end of the study  or subject is lost to follow up . Any AEs or SAEs 
that are ongoing at the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period will be managed as described in 
section 8.2.6 . 
8.2.3  Intensity of Adverse Event  
The Investigator must assess the intensity of each reported AE according to the following 
grading scale:  
Table 4 Intensity of Adverse Events  
Mild: Easily tolerated, not interfering with normal everyday activities  
Moderate : Interferes with normal everyday activities, but the subject is still able to 
function  
Severe : Incapacitating and requiring medical intervention  
8.2.4  Relationship to Investigational Product and Relationship to Study 
Procedures  
The Investigator must assess the causal relationship between the exposure to the IP (P4M3 Gen  
2.0 and cigarettes)  and each of the reported AEs, using the classification system and the criteria 
described below. The same assessment must be made separately to assess the causal 
relationship between the study procedures and each of the reported AEs:  
Not related : The temp oral relationship of the adverse event to IP administration or study 
procedure(s) makes a causal relationship unlikely, or concomitant medication, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.  
Related : The temporal relationship of the adverse event to IP or study procedure(s) 
makes a causal relationship possible, and concomitant medication, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation 
for the obser ved event.  
8.2.5  Expectedness  
Any AE assessed as related to the IP  (P4M 3 Gen 2.0 or cigarettes)  will be assessed for its 
expectedness. An AE will be regarded as “unexpected” if its nature or severity is not consistent 
with information already recorded in sectio n 6.5 of the current Investigator’s Brochure  [5].

commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . 8.2.6  Follow -up of Non -serious and Serious Adverse Events  
Any non -serious AE that is ongoing at the time of Discharge or early termination will be 
followed -up by the Investigator during the Safety Follow -Up Period until it has been resolved, 
stabilized (i.e., no worsening of the condition), or an acceptable expla nation has been found 
(e.g., a chronic condition). The follow -up of the ongoing non -serious AEs will be done via a 
phone call performed at the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period.  If the subject is not responding 
at the first phone call additional two attem pts will be made, then subject will be declared lost 
to follow -up.  
At the end of the 3-day Safety FU Period, all ongoing non -serious AEs will have the outcome 
documented as “unknown” and will not be followed -up by the Investigator. At the discretion 
of th e Investigator, the subject will be referred to his General Practitioner to have his/her 
ongoing AEs addressed accordingly.  
All SAEs will be followed up by the Investigator or designee after the end of the Safety Follow -
Up Period, until their resolution, s tabilization (i.e., no worsening of the condition), or an 
acceptable explanation has been found (e.g., a chronic condition).  In case the subject cannot 
be reached for additional information related to SAE(s), a total 3 attempts should be performed 
before t he subject will be declared as lost to follow -up. 
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE observed during the period of collection in this study must be reported within 24 
hours of first awareness to Sponsor , via email, having the SAE form attached  as detailed in the 
Safety Management Plan (SMP) . 
As further information regarding an already reported SAE becomes available to any of the 
parties involved in this study, such follow -up information should be reported on a new SAE 
report form, marked as a follow -up report and submitted to Sponsor according  to the same 
timelines as described above. The follow -up SAE report form must include the minimum 
information required for form completion and only changed/new information needs to be 
specified. Information provided in the follow -up SAE report form superse des any information 
that was initially reported.  
The SAE report form to be used in this study is provided as a separate document. All SAEs 
will also be recorded on the relevant CRF page, in addition to the SAE report form.  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for submitting the relevant reports of SAEs that 
occur during the study to the IRB, according to local regulations and in accordance with the 
respective safety management plan (SMP).

without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . 8.4 Reporting of Other Events Critical to Safety Evaluations  
8.4.1  Abnormal Results of Laboratory Tests  
Any clinical safety laboratory test result that is outside of the normal reference range will be 
reviewed by the Investigator and assessed for clinical significance according to its severity. 
The severity of abnormal labor atory test result must be assessed using Common Terminology 
Criteria  for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 5.0 grading scales ( Appendix C). Whenever that 
grading  scheme is not available for the laboratory result of concern, the Investigator should 
assess the severity and the clinical significance of that result using his/her medical judgment.  
Abnormal laboratory test results detected at the Screening Visit whose C TCAE grades are 2 or 
higher or still are CTCAE grade 1 and deemed clinically significant are usually concomitant 
disease or a manifestation of one and must be recorded accordingly.  
However, in some instances, they may be assessed as AEs (and therefore mus t be handled as 
described  in section  8.2) or as manifestations of already reported AEs. This decision will 
require a careful assessment of the abnormal result within the clinical context on a case -by-
case basis and will depend on the  Investigator's medical judgment.  
Abnormal laboratory test results detected after the Screening Visit whose CTCAE grades are 
2 or higher or still are CTCAE grade 1 and deemed clinically significant must either be 
recorded as AEs (and handled as described  in section  8.2) or linked to a concomitant disease 
or to an already reported AE.  
The principles for assessing and reporting abnormal laboratory test r esults, emerging after the 
Screening Visit, using CTCAE 5.0 grading scales are set up in Table 5: 
Table 5  Principles for Assessing and Reporting Abnormal Laboratory 
Test Results  
Grading  Clinically significant?  Is it a grade increase 
from previous results 
in study?  Report?  
Grade 1  No Not applicable  No 
Grade 1  Yes No No* 
Grade 1  Yes Yes Yes, as AE or linked to 
an already reported AE  
Grade 2 or higher  No/Yes  No No* 
Grade 2 or higher  No/Yes  Yes Yes, as AE or linked to 
an already reported AE   
* in this situation, this abnormal lab test result is either a manifestation of a concomitant disease or of an already 
reported AE.

In general, laboratory values will be recorded as “increased <lab parameter>” or “decreased 
<lab parameter>” to ensure consistency of recording/coding.   
8.4.2  Reporting other abnormal findings  
The other abnormal findings discovered during different clinical ass essments (e.g., ECG, 
spirometry, physical examination, vital signs, body weight)  should be evaluated for clinical 
significance by the Investigator/designee based on his/her medical judgement. All abnormal 
clinically significant test results or clinical exa mination findings should be reported as AEs 
and handled as described in  section  8.2. 
8.5 Reporting and Follow –Up of Pregnancies  
8.5.1  Period of Collection and Follow -up 
Pregnancies detected between the time of signature of the ICF and the time before first 
exposure to the IP will be co nsidered a reason for screen failure. No pregnancy form will be 
filled in that case, however the diagnosed pregnancy must be captured in the screen failure 
page of the CRF.  
In case of pregnancies detected between enrollment and prior to randomization, subj ect will 
be discontinued, and reported as “enrolled but not randomized” subject. Early termination 
procedures shall apply. No pregnancy form will be filled.  
Any pregnancy detected after randomization must be reported by the Investigator within 24 
hours. Th is also includes pregnancies spontaneously reported to the Investigator after the end 
of the study for a subject. A dedicated pregnancy form will be used to report reportable cases 
of pregnancy . 
 
Any pregnancy that was potentially associated with exposure to IP (P4M3 Gen 2.0  or cigarette) 
will be followed -up until an outcome is reached (e.g., normal delivery, spontaneous abortion, 
or voluntary termination) and also until 8 weeks after delivery. Any pregnancy complication, 
adverse pregnancy outcome or matern al complications will be recorded as an AE accordingly.  
 
The procedure outlined in section 8.3 should be followed to collect  pregnancy reports and 
provide any additional/follow -up information to Sponsor.

8.5.2  Reporting of Pregnancies  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the responsible IRB  of any pregnancy case that 
was reported during the study, as determined by local regulations.  
8.6 Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation  
Subjects who are discontinued from the study because of an AE will undergo the early 
termination procedures (section 9.7), as soon as practical after discontinuation and will enter 
the 3-day Safety Follow -Up Period. In general, AEs will be followed -up until resolved, 
stabilized (i.e., no worsening of the event), or a plausible explanation has been found and until 
the end of the study.  
Any AEs or SAEs that are ongoing at the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period will be managed 
as described in section 8.2.6 . 
8.7 Investiga tional Product Malfunction and Misuse  
Any occurrence of P4M3 Gen  2.0 product  events, affecting P4M3 Gen  2.0 Battery unit and /or 
P4M3 Gen  2.0 Cartridge, including malfunction or misuse (use not in accordance with its 
instruction) by a subject will be documented by the Investigator . Information regarding P4M3 
Gen 2.0 product events should be actively collected during the study and assessed for severity 
as Minor or Major:  
Minor  – Can be resolved easily.  
Major  – Cannot  be resolved.  
P4M3 Gen  2.0 product events will be categorized into: Break, Fluid Leak, Intermittent Loss of 
Power, Power Problem, Premature Indicator Activation or Other.  
Investigational product misuse may result in use -related hazards (section  2.3.4). 
Furthermore, any malfunction or misuse of P4M3 Gen  2.0 that leads to an AE/SAE will follow 
the same processes as described above.

A detailed schedule of assessment can be fo und in  Appendix A. Measurements not conducted 
at the exact time point but  conducted within the given time window (if applicable) do not 
constitute a protocol deviation but an accepted variability for the given time point . 
In general, if no start time for the procedures is provided, then the procedure can be performed 
at any tim e during the day.  
The main  objective for this study is the evaluation of the plasma concentration -time profile of 
nicotine and derived PK parameters. Therefore, the collection of blood samples for 
determination of plasma nicotine concentration should be as  close to the schedule time as 
possible and should take precedence over any other assessments  required at the same time.  
9.1 Screening Visit (Day -29 to Day -2) 
The Screening Visit will be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment at Admission (Day 
-1). Fir st, the ICF along with study information should be given to the subject. Prior to being 
asked to sign the consent form, subjects will be given time to review the study information and 
ask any questions. When/if the ICF is signed, dated and timed, the other  screening procedures 
can be performed in the order deemed most practical. While it is recommended to complete as 
many screening procedures as possible in one day, it is permissible to complete those over 
more than one day. Smoking is allowed at the Screen ing Visit at the discretion of the 
investigational site.

10.1 Monitoring  
A Clinical Research Associate (“Monitor”) from an independent contract research organization 
(CRO) not involved with the study site w ill be responsible for the monitoring of the study. 
Monitoring will be performed according to the CRO’s SOPs and as per the agreed monitoring 
plan with the Sponsor.  
Before the first subject is screened and included in the study, an Investigator meeting/sit e 
initiation visit will be conducted. During this meeting/visit, the general training of the study 
procedures and specific training on selected procedures will be performed and documented . 
All activities to be conducted will be described in the monitoring plan.  
During the study, the Monitor will have regular contact with the investigational site, including 
routine monitoring visits. The frequency and purpose of the monitoring visits will be defined 
in the monitoring plan agreed with the Sponsor.  
The Inves tigator or designee shall permit the Monitor to review study data as frequently as 
deemed necessary to ensure that data are being recorded in an adequate manner and that 
protocol adherence is satisfactory.  
The Investigator or designee shall access medical  records for the Monitor so that entries in the 
CRFs may be verified. The Investigator or designee, as part of their responsibilities, is expected 
to ensure that the study adheres to GCP requirements.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investi gator’s staff, must be available during 
the monitoring visit to review the data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to the 
subject’s records for source data verification.  
The Monitor and the Sponsor’s personnel will be available between visi ts, should the 
Investigator or other staff at the investigational site need information and/or advice.  
Communication by telephone, mail and e -mail may be used as needed to supplement 
investigational site visits. The Investigator and study personnel will c ooperate with the 
Monitor, provide all appropriate documentation and will be available to discuss the study.  
10.2 Training of Staff  
Prior to the screening of the first subject, an Investigator Meeting/Study Initiation Visit will be 
held. During this meeting/vi sit, the Sponsor or its authorized representative will discuss the 
requirements of the clinical study protocol and related documents and will also provide training 
to the relevant systems and other study -specific procedures. The activities of this meeting/ visit 
will be described in the monitoring plan.

any new infor mation relevant to the performance of this study is forwarded in a timely manner 
to the staff. The Investigator or designee will maintain a record of all individuals involved in 
the study.  
10.3 Audits and Inspections  
Good Clinical Practice regulations require independent inspections of clinical program 
activities. Such inspections may be performed at any time before, during and/or after the study.  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, regulatory agencies and/or IRB may perform audits 
or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted , and data was recorded, analyzed,  and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH GCP guidelines and any applicable 
regulatory requirements. The Investigator or designee will contact the Sponsor or the 
authorized representative immediately if contac ted by a regulatory agency about an inspection 
at their investigational site.  
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and accurate 
filing system of all study -related documentation that will be suitable for inspecti on at any time 
by the Sponsor, its authorized representative and/or regulatory agencies. By signing this 
protocol, the Investigator or designee understands and agrees to provide access to the necessary 
documentation and files.

All data management activities will be described in detail in the data management plan (DMP) 
and documents specified therein.  
11.1 Data Capture  
11.1.1  Case Report Forms and Study Records  
CRFs are produced  by the CRO responsible for Data Management activities (DM -CRO) , 
stored electronically, and are available to the designated study team members. Each CRF is 
reviewed and signed by the Investigator . The final signed CRFs are provided to the Sponsor in 
the format as decided upon between DM-CRO  and the Sponsor (e.g., CD, flash drive , SFTP). 
This w ill be documented in the DMP). The subject questionnaires will be completed directly 
by the subject. Trained study personnel will be responsible for capturing the data from the 
observations, tests, and assessments specified in the pr otocol in the source documents and DM-
CRO  will enter the data into the CRF, in accordance with the CRF Completion Guidelines.  
The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all data related 
to the clinical study and ensur ing that the data are accurate, authentic/original, legible, timely

12.1 General Considerations  
Full det ails of the statistical analysis will be given in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). The 
following statistical analyses will not be performed prior to the finalization of the SAP. Any 
changes to the planned statistical methods from the SAP will be docume nted in the clinical 
study report ( CSR ). The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS®, version 9.2 or 
later.  
12.1.1  Stratification Criteria  
The sample enrollment will enforce at least 40% of each sex, therefore analyses will be 
stratified by sex, as well as unstratified,  as detailed in the SAP.  
12.1.2  Definitions for Statistical Data Analysis  
For PK  and PD analys es, baseline will be defined as the last assessment prior to T 0 (5 minutes 
prior to T 0) for each study day of exposure . 
Nicotine PK parameters  (e.g., Tmax, C max, AUC 0-Tmax) will be  derived from background -
corrected  nicotine concentrations.  
12.1.3  Descriptive Statistics  
All data will be presented in listings, ordered by subject, study visit, product,  and time point , 
unless otherwise specified.  
Continuous  endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics including number of 
subjects (n), number and percent of subjects with missing data, arithmetic means and standard 
deviations (mean and SD), median, first and third quartiles, minimum and maximum.  
For log normally distributed endpoints , geometric mean, geometric CV, and confidence 
interval  will be presented additionally .  
Nominal c ategorical variables will be summarized by frequency statistics (number and 
percentage) , including the number of missing data as a category .  
Ordinal categorical data  (e.g., Tmax) will be summarized by number of subjects (n), number 
and percent of subjects with missing data , median, first and third quartiles, and minimum and 
maximum . 
For PK and PD endpoints, a ll analyses and  summaries will be performed by product.

commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . For safety endpoints, analyses and summaries will be performed by product and sequence, and 
overall.  
12.1.4  Handling of Missing Values and of Values outside the Detection Limits  
In general, missing data will not be imputed  in this study, due to the nature of the measurements 
and the short periods of exposure and use. However, for questionnaire data , total scores and 
domain or subscale scores may use a certain degree of imputation by averaging across 
individual item scores. Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
In general, bioanalytical values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be 
imputed using 0.5 x lower limit of quantification. For values above the upper limit of 
quantification (ULOQ), the ULOQ  will be used for calculation and reporting in summary 
tables.   
For nicotine concentrations below the LLOQ (BLOQ):  
• BLOQ values before T0 will be imputed by LLOQ/2.  
• BLOQ values after the last quantifiable value are not included in the analysis (e.g., for 
the cal culation of AUC).  
• Any BLOQ value (after T0 and before the last quantifiable value) would need to be 
queried and, if confirmed, it will be imputed by LLOQ/2.   
The number and percent of values below LLOQ or above ULOQ will be presented in each 
summary table.  
12.1.5  Significance Level for Inferential Analysis  
Not applicable.  
12.2 Determination of Sample Size and Power Consideration  
In this study 36 subjects will be randomized to 6 product use sequences.  This sample size is 
empirically based as there are no considerations for statistical hypothesis.  
In an analysis of confidence interval precision on the P4M3 Gen 2.0: cigarettes Cmax ratios , 
performed with SAS with 10 ,000 simulations,  
• The precision has been determined to be of  0.55, and  
• The geometric coefficient of variation  (GCV) has b een determined to be of 50%.

commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . 12.2.1  Assumptions  
The precision has been determined using the following geometric mean (GM), geometric 
coefficient of variation (GCV) and within subjects correlation assumptions for C max: 
• For all products the GCV is 80% ( in previous study [5] GCV is in the range of 0.63 to 
0.83)  
• For usual brand of cigarettes, the GM is 12  ng/mL  (in previous studies  [32-34] this GM 
is in the range of 11 to 13)  
• For P4M3 Gen  2.0 variants with 3.5% nicotine , the GM is 11  ng/mL  (in previous a 
previous study [5] GM is in the range of 9.4 to 12)  
• The correlation within subjects on log -transformed data is 0.8 (in previous studies [32-
34] this correlation is in the range of 0.82 to 0.88)  
12.2.2  Method  
The analysis of confidence interval precision on the P4M3 Gen  2.0: cigarettes Cmax ratios has 
been implemented using SAS, simulating 10000 sets of log -transformed data fo r 36 subjects 
with the assumptions described in section  12.2.1 , the 3 periods and the 6 sequences of this 
cross -over design . 
The statistical analysis  has been performed with a linear model with repeated measurement 
including as fixed effect the sequence, the period,  and the product exposure.  
The P4M3 Gen  2.0:cigarettes Cmax ratios and related confidence intervals have been 
determined by using the expon ential of the difference between P4M3 Gen  2.0 variants and 
cigarettes on the log -transformed data.  
Then precision has been determined as the 90th percentile of the 95% confidence interval of 
the P4M3 Gen  2.0: cigarettes Cmax ratios. 
12.3 Analysis Populations  
Populations will be described on the screened population.  
Demographics , baseline characteristics, pharmacokinetics endpoints , pharmacodynamics

The screened population consists of all subjects who underwent screening.  
12.3.2  Safety Population  
The safety population  is a subset of the screened population and  consists of all subjects who 
give informed consent, ha ve at least one exposure to P4M3 Gen  2.0, including the product test 
at Admission (Day -1), and have at least one safety assessment.  
12.3.3  Randomized Population  
The randomized population is a subset of the s afety population and  consists of all the subjects 
who were randomized at Admission ( Day -1). 
12.3.4  Pharmacokinetics Population  
The PK population  Pharmacokinetic  (PK) Population  is a subset of the randomized population 
and consist s of all randomized  subjects for whom at least one nicotine PK parameter can be 
derived. Only subjects without major protocol deviations, as defined in the SAP , which have 
an impact on evaluability of the main  objective will be included in the PK population.  
12.4 Demographics and  Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic information and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the PK 
population. This summary will also be performed for the randomized  population if there is at 
least a difference of 1 subject between the population s.  
Summaries will include sex, age, height, weight and BMI, nicotine/tobacco product use 
history , FTND, CYP2A6 activity and other endpoints that are only captured prior to product 
use.

Confidentiality Statement  
Data and information contained in this document are considered to constitute trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A . To minimize the carry -over effect in the nicotine plasma PK parameters ( section  4.2), 
background -concentration correction will be applied to the concentration data. The baseline 
correction will be implem ented by calculating the nicotine concentration  paramet ers using 
adjust ed concentration values as described below. 
The nicotine terminal  elimination rate constant λz (and terminal elimination half -life t1/2z) 
will be estimated from the Day 2 PK samples  (section 7.5.1 ) by using  a linear regression  on 
the log plasma nicotine concentration data. The regression analysis  should contain data from 
at least 3 different time points in the terminal phase (including the last quantifiable 
concentration but Cmax), consistent with the assessment of a straight line on the log -transformed 
scale. The nicotine plasma background -correc ted PK parameters will be derived by performing 
the NCA on the corrected concentrations.  
For the purposes of background -correction of the plasma c oncentrations pos t-baseline the 
followi ng formul a will be applied : C t = uCt - uC0 * e-λz·t. Where, C t is the corrected 
concentration  at each time point, uCt is the uncorrected concentration  at each time point, uC0 
is the pre -use baseline concentration, λ z is the Day 2 terminal elimination rate constant and t is 
the actual time  [35]. For the purposes of background -correction of the plasma c oncentrations 
post-baseline the followi ng formul a will be applied : C t = uCt - uC0 * e-λz·t. Where, C t is the 
corrected concentration  at each time point, uCt is the uncorrected concentration  at each time 
point, uC0 is the pre -use baseline concentration, λ z is the Day 2 terminal elimination rate 
constant and t is the actual time  [35].  
The procedure of the baseline adjustment will be detailed in the SAP.  
If plasma concentrations cannot be background -corrected in a sufficient number of subjects, 
alternative analysis methods will be used, as detailed in the SAP.  
In particular, the following PK parameters will be derived from nicotine levels adjusted for 
baseline:  
Cmax Maximum background -corrected plasma concentration. C max will be 
reported as long as there is at least one quantifiable concentration post T 0. 
Tmax Time to maximum background -corrected plasma nicotine concentration 
Cmax. 
AUC 0-2min  Area under the background -corrected plasma concentration -time curve 
from start of product use (T 0) to 2  minutes . 
AUC 0-4min Area under the background -corrected concentration -time curve from T 0 
to 4 minutes.

All duties and responsibilities transferred by the Sponsor to the above listed CROs will be 
defined in an agreement signed between the relevant two parties.  
Any SAEs or pregnancies will be handled by the Investigator, study monitor (or Sponsor), as 
per the instructions listed in section 8.3. 
Details of the laboratories conducting the clinical safety laboratory services and bioanalyses 
are shown in  Appendix C.  
13.2 Subject  Recruitment  
Subjects  will be recruited from the volunteers’ database maintained by the CRO. This database 
contains a pool of volunteers that are contacted whenever necessary to enroll  subjects in a new 
study. Before the  start of the new study, the Investigator and other relevant staff discuss with 
the volunteers’ recruiter the study recruitment needs and specific requirements. On the basis 
of this information, the volunteers’ recruiter queries the database, contacts pote ntial volunteers  
to propose the study and evaluate their interest and availability. In addition to the volunteers 
database, new subjects often call or email the CRO asking to become a research volunteer, 
after hearing of the clinical site activities from o ther volunteers or friends or after checking the 
company web site. The CRO and its clinical site have detailed SOPs on the recruitment process.  
13.3 Subject Confidentiality  
All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subjects' s tate of 
health will be regarded as confidential. A statement to this effect will be written in the 
information provided to the subject. An agreement to disclose any such information will be 
obtained from the subject in writing and signed by the subject, in  compliance with all local and 
national data protection and privacy legislation.  
The name of the subjects participating in this study will be kept confidential. Subjects will be 
identifiable by the Sponsor (or Sponsor’s authorized representative) on CRFs a nd other 
documents by their subject (or randomization) number/code, sex, and age, but not by name, 
initial, or any other details relating to identifiable person ( e.g., address, social security number, 
medical chart number, etc.). The assignment of a subject number/code for subject identification 
will be based on the appropriate data protection rules.  
Any documents that allow full identification of the subject (e.g., the subject’s signed ICF) must 
be maintained in confidence by the Investigator. If any  document relating to this study shows 
a subject’s name or any other details relating to an identifiable person ( e.g., address, social 
security number, medical chart number, etc.), the name or other identifiable details must be

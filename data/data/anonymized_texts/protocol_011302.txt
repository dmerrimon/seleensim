TITLE Open-Label Extension Study of EFC12492, R727-CL-1112, EFC12732, & 
LTS11717 Studies to Assess the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of 
Alirocumab in Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Multinational - Multicenter 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT Phase 3 
STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary objective 
x To assess the long-term safety of alirocumab when added to currently available lipid-modifying drug therapy in patients with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) who have 
completed one of the following studies: EFC12492, R727-CL-1112, 
EFC12732 & LTS11717. 
Secondary objectives 
x To evaluate the long-term efficacy of alirocumab on lipid parameters.  
x To evaluate the long term immunogenicity of alirocumab. 
STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, open-label extension (OLE), uncontrolled study. 
Patients must have been diagnosed with heFH in the parent study and have 
completed one of the four randomized, double-blind, 18-month parent studies. 
Patients who missed the last injection or who performed the end of treatment 
visit outside the expected timelines can also be enrolled. 
The end of treatment visit of the Double-Blind Treatment Period of the parent 
study corresponds to the visit 1 (Day 1) of the OLE study, except for the 
patients having participated in the LTS11717. These latter patients will have 
the opportunity to enter the OLE study, after they have completed the parent 
study, including the 8 week follow-up period. Patients who meet eligibility 
criteria at the visit 1 (Day 1) will receive a first SC injection of alirocumab on 
that day.  
All patients will receive 75 mg Q2W at entry into the OLE, with the exception 
of patients from EFC12732 (ODYSSEY High-FH). These latter patients, who 
had a screening LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL in the parent study, will hence receive 
150 mg Q2W at entry into the OLE, as in the parent study. 
At entry in the OLE (at visit 1 on Day 1): 
x All eligible patients from EFC12732 will get the alirocumab dose 
150 mg at Day 1.  
x All eligible patients from EFC12492, R727-CL-1112 and LTS11717 
will get 75 mg alirocumab.  
The first SC injection of alirocumab will be administered in the clinic (Day 1, Visit 1). Patients from the LTS11717 will have the possibility to perform a 
placebo self-injection training before the first alirocumab administration using 
an auto-injector on that same day (Day 1), as they used a different device (a prefilled syringe) in the parent study.  
From Visit 1, patients have the option to self-administer or have the study 
drug injection administered by another designated person (such as spouse,

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 4 relative, etc.).  
From Day 1 (Visit 1) until Week 8 (first unblinded LDL-C value), neither the 
treatment received at the end of the double-blind treatment period in the parent study, nor the lipid parameters level, will be known by the Investigator, 
and by the patient, in order to prevent any potential blinding breaking of the 
parent clinical study. However, from Week 8 (Visit 3) in the OLE, the lipid 
values will be communicated to the investigator in real time.  
From Week 12 (Visit 4), the Investigator will be responsible, based on his/her 
own judgment and the patients’ LDL levels, to manage alirocumab dose (up-
titration from 75 to 150 mg every 2 weeks, down-titration from 150 to 75 mg 
every 2 weeks or maintenance of the dose, will be possible).  
Daily dose of statin or of other lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) (if applicable) 
can be modified based on the Investigator’s judgment throughout the study.  
After Week 24 (visit 5), visits will be scheduled every 24 weeks 
(approximately 6 months) and a dispensation visit will be scheduled in between the 24 weeks visits interval. This dispensation visit will allow to 
supply IMP for the next 3 months, and will also allow to check the treatment 
compliance, the concomitant medications, and occurrence of any adverse 
event. 
Patients should be on a stable diet (NCEP-ATPIII TLC diet or equivalent) 
throughout the entire study duration from visit 1 (V1) to the end of OLE 
treatment period (OLETP) (V17). 
STUDY POPULATION  
Main selection criteria Inclusion criteria  
x Eligible patients for this OLE study will be men and women 
diagnosed with heFH in the parent study and who have completed 
one of the following studies, EFC12492, R727-CL-1112, EFC12732 
or LTS11717. Patients who missed the last injection or who 
performed the end of treatment visit outside the expected timelines 
can also be enrolled. 
 
Exclusion criteria 
x Significant protocol deviation in the parent study based on the 
Investigator judgment, such as non-compliance by the patient. 
x Adverse event leading to permanent discontinuation from parent 
study. 
x Have any new condition or worsening of existing condition which in the opinion of the Investigator would make the patient unsuitable for 
enrollment, or could interfere with the patient participating in or 
completing the study.   
x Positive pregnancy test at the end of treatment visit or end of study visit, according to the parent study the patient was originating from.  
x Women of childbearing potential not willing to continue highly-effective method of birth control and/or who are unwilling or unable 
to be tested for pregnancy. 
Total expected number of patients Up to approximately 1,200 patients may be enrolled in the study. 
Expected number of sites  Approximately 200 sites worldwide

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 6 ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE Patient assessments in the OLE period 
x Day 1 / Week 0 (End of treatment visit of the parent double-blind 
study = OLE Visit 1, except for the patients having participated in 
the LTS11717). 
x Complete study visits: Patients will be assessed in the clinic at 
Weeks 4 (Visit 2), 8 (Visit 3), 12 (Visit 4), 24 (Visit 5), and then 
every 24 weeks until EOT Visit (Visit 17), or early termination.  
x IMP dispensing visits: From Week 24, until study completion IMP 
dispensing visits will be scheduled every 12 weeks, in-between the clinic visits in order to allow for dispensing IMP. 
Patient assessments in the FU period 
x A follow up call, Visit 18, will be planned 10 weeks after the last IMP injection, ie 8 weeks after the EOT visit, for the patients who will 
complete the study and for the patients who will early discontinue 
whatever the reason. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination: 
As this study is an open-label extension planning to include patients from previous studies, no calculation for sample size was performed. It is expected 
to enroll up to 1,200 heFH patients based on the number of patients already enrolled in the parent studies.  
Analysis Population: 
Safety analyses will be performed on Safety population which consists of 
patients receiving at least one dose or partial dose of IMP in the current study. 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on patients receiving at least one dose or 
partial dose of IMP in the current study, with a baseline (from parent study) 
LDL-C available and with at least one LDL-C value available in the period 
from first IMP injection in the current study to last IMP injection + 21 days.  
Analysis of safety endpoints: 
Safety analysis (Adverse events, laboratory, vital signs) will be descriptive, 
based on the safety population. The safety analysis will focus on the Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (T EAE) period defined as the time from 
the first dose of the current study to the last dose of IMP + 70 days (10 weeks).  
For analyses of changes from baseline for laboratory and vital signs 
parameters, baseline of the parent study or of the current study may be 
considered. 
Efficacy parameters: As secondary objectives of the study, efficacy variables will be explored 
through descriptive statistics at each scheduled visit of the current study. 
Formal statistical testing is not planned and alpha adjustments not needed. 95% confidence intervals will be provided for percent changes from baseline 
and success rate to reach targets.  
In addition, percent changes from baseline of the parent study and success 
rate to reach targets from the week 8 time point will also be analyzed in all 
groups combined as the influence of treatment received during the parent study should be offset by the treatment received during the current study after 
8 weeks of treatment.

SAR236553 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to PCSK9. Its 
International Nonproprietary Name  (INN) is alirocumab. Alirocumab was previously referred as 
SAR236553 or REGN727. All relevant information concerning the compound is available in the latest version of the Clinical Investigator’s Brochure (CIB). 
Background on patient populations: 
This open-label extension stud y will include patients diagnosed with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia (heFH) who have completed EFC12492, R727-CL-1112, EFC12732 or 
LTS11717.  
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder of lipid  metabolism that predisposes a 
person to premature severe card iovascular disease (CVD).  Familial hypercholesterolemia has a 
high prevalence in Caucasian populations, where an estimated 1 in 500 individuals are affected.  
Defects in at least 3 different genes that code for proteins involved in hepatic clearance of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) can cause FH.  These include mutations in the gene coding for the LDL receptor (LDL-R) that removes LDL-C from the circulation, and less commonly, in the gene for Apo B, which is the major protein of the LDL particle.  In rare cases, the gene coding for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), an enzyme involved in 
degrading the LDL-R (gain of func tion mutation), is mutated.  In all cases, this results in an 
accumulation of LDL-C in the plasma from birth, and subsequent development of tendon 
xanthomas, xanthelasmas, atheromata, and premature CVD. 
In the heterozygous form of FH (heFH), the cumulative risk of experiencing a coronary event by 
the age of 60 years without effective treatment is at least 50% in men and approximately 30% in women (coronary disease occurs approximately 10  years later in women than in men, with a 
marked increase in post-menopausal women).  Before effective treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (commo nly referred to as statins) became available, 
mortality from coronary disease was increased by nearly 100 fold in young FH adults aged 20 to 39 years, and approximately 4 fold for FH patients aged 40 to 59 years ( 1). 
In the real world, a large proportion of patients with FH do not reach treatment goals and, by consequence, remain at increased risk of CVD ( 2). In a recent large cross-sectional study 
conducted in the Netherlands, nearly all heterozygous FH patients (96%) were on statin treatment. Only 21% of patients achieved the LDL-C goal of less than 100 mg/dL (less than 2.59 mmol/L) and about 5% of patients still had an LDL-C concentration greater than 200 mg/dL. Among those not at goal, 27% were on combination ther apy of maximum statin dose and ezetimibe ( 3). These 
data emphasize the need for new LDL-lowering therapies.

alirocumab - LTS13463 Version number: 1  
 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 21 Introduction to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and alirocumab: 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) belongs to the subtilisin family of serine 
proteases and is highly expressed in the liver. PCSK9 is involved in regulating the levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) protein ( 4) (5). Once PCSK9 is secreted into plasma, it 
directly binds to the LDL-R and promotes its degradation. The increased degradation of LDL-Rs leads to a reduced removal of LDL particles -C and therefore, higher circulating levels of LDL-C.Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDL-R protein in the liver while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDL-R in the liver ( 6), (7). In humans, PCSK9 mutations have been identified: the gain-of-function mutations 
are rare and cause an autosomal dominant form of severe hypercholesterolemia and premature coronary heart disease (CHD), whereas loss-of-function mutations are more common and are associated with reduced plasma levels of LDL-C and protection from CHD ( 8) (9).  
Therefore, blocking PCSK9 from binding to the LDL-R can potentially benefit patients with hypercholesterolemia by decreasing their plasma  LDL-C levels. In addition, PCSK9 messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels are increased in response to statins, potentially attenuating their cholester ol-lowering effect ( 10). 
Rationale for study design: 
The objective of the present study is to provide additional long term safety and efficacy 
experience with alirocumab in a closer to real life setting than a double-blind design study, in patients with heFH receiving lipid-modifying drug therapy including statins.  
Patients with heFH who cannot attain LDL-C goal despite lipid-modifying therapy, including a 
statin at maximally tolerated dose, present a high  unmet need regarding their life-long increased 
cardiovascular risk.  This study gives these heFH patients, who already participated in one of the double-blind 18-month ODYSSEY Phase 3 studies, the possibility to start or continue treatment 
with alirocumab after the end of the parent study. All patients will receive alirocumab at entry in 
the open-label extension study regardless of the study treatment they received during the 18-
month double-blind treatment period of the parent study, provided they fulfill the eligibility criteria of the open-label extension study. 
Description of the parent studies: 
The study design of the four concerned parent studies was similar: Phas e 3, 18-month treatment 
duration, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, multi-national, multi-
center study.

-  Patients not able to be on any of the above statin doses should be treated with the daily dose of atorvastatin, 
rosuvastatin or simvastatin which is considered appropriate for the patient as per the investigator's judgment or concerns. Some examples of acceptable reasons for a patient taking a lower statin dose include, but are 
not limited to: adverse effects on higher doses, advanced age, low body mass index, regional practices, local 
prescribing information, concomitant medications, co-morbid conditions such as impaired glucose 
tolerance/impaired fasting glucose. The reason(s) will need to be documented in the case report form. 
Rationale for dose selection: 
Two doses of alirocumab are currently being evaluated in the ODYSSEY Phase 3 program: 75 mg 
and 150 mg, to be administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W), based on data from the 
Phase 1 and 2 programs. However, for many patients, the magnitude of effect observed with the

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 23 150 mg Q2W dose may not be needed to achieve the target LDL-C goal, and starting with a lower 
dose may be undertaken.  
From the range of Q2W doses tested in the alirocumab Phase 2 program, 75 mg Q2W has been 
selected to be investigated in the Phase 3 program by employing the use of a dose response model. 
Most patients participating in the double-blind Phase 3 trials have initially been treated with 75 
mg Q2W and only those patients whose LDL-C levels remain above goal after 8 weeks of treatment are up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W (at week 12) in this initial double-blind treatment period.  
Only patients who are participating in two studies, LTS11717 and EFC12732 were initiated with 
150 mg Q2W. In the LTS11717 study, the aim was to provide the highest systemic exposure to alirocumab, in order to gather adequate safety and tolerability information at this dose; EFC12732 only included patients with a LDL-C level above 160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L) while receiving maximal tolerated statin: the aim was to assess the benefit from starting directly at the most effective dose in this specific population of patients who need large LDL-C decrease.  
In the OLE study, patients will st art treatment with 75 mg Q2W, re gardless of the treatment / dose 
they received at the end of the parent study, except patients from EFC12732. These latter patients, 
who had a screening LDL-C  160 mg/dL in the parent study, will receive 150 mg Q2W at entry 
into the OLE. Based on LDL-C value that will be unblinded from Week 8, the treatment dose can be up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W for patients receiving 75 mg Q2W or down-titrated to 75 mg Q2W for patients receiving 150 mg Q2W from Week 12 as needed. In order to maintain the blind in the parent study, which will still be ongoing at the time the first patients are included in the OLE, no 
information will be available on the treatment / dose received at the end of the parent study, nor on LDL-C level at the end of the parent study / baseline of the OLE.  
Brief description of the OLE study: 
Depending on the parent study the patient participated in, either 75 mg or 150 mg every 2 weeks 
will be administered at the entry in the OLE study.   
From Week 12 (Visit 4), based on the Investigator judgment and the LDL-C level unblinded from 
Week 8, dose adjustment, such as up-titration to 150 mg Q2W or down-titration to 75 mg Q2W of alirocumab, will be possible. It is anticipated that in real life, after initial up-titration, subsequent dose adjustment over time may include down-titration. This will be allowed in this study, and the Investigator will be asked to report the reason for down-titration from 150 to 75 mg Q2W and for up-titration from 75 mg to 150 mg Q2W. 
Taking into consideration the current number of patients enrolled in the four parent studies, it is 
estimated that up to approximately 1,200 patients could be enrolled. 
This open-label extension study will be conducted for approximately three additional years or 
more, depending on the inclusion date in the current study, after the 18-month double-blind 
treatment period of the parent studies.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
This is a multicenter, multinational, Phase 3, open-label extension, uncontrolled study to assess 
the long-term safety and efficacy of alirocumab, when added to currently available LMT, in heFH patients previously participating in the ODYSSEY FH I, ODYSSEY FH II, ODYSSEY High FH or ODYSSEY Long Term studies.  
Patients must have been diagnosed with heFH in the parent study, have completed one of the 
above parent studies, and be willing to participate in the ODYSSEY OLE study. Patients who missed the last injection or who performed the end of treatment visit outside the expected timelines can also be enrolled. 
The visit 1 (Day 1) of the ODYSSEY OLE study corresponds to: 
x the end of treatment visit of the Double-Blind Treatment Period for the patients enrolled in 
one of the three following parent studies ODYSSEY FH I, ODYSSEY FH II, ODYSSEY 
High FH. 
x the end of study visit, after the 8 week follow-up period, for the patients having participated in the ODYSSEY Long Term study. 
Patients who meet eligibility criteria at the visit 1 (Day 1) will receive the first SC injection of alirocumab in the clinic  on the same day.  
In addition, patients from the ODYSSEY Long Term study will have the possibility to perform a placebo, self-injection training, before the first alirocumab administration using an auto-injector on that same day (Day 1), as they used a different device (a prefilled syringe) in the parent study.  
At entry in the ODYSSEY OLE study, visit 1 on Day 1: 
x All eligible patients from ODYSSEY High FH will get the alirocumab 150 mg dose. 
x All eligible patients from ODYSSEY FH I, ODYSSEY FH II and ODYSSEY Long Term 
will get alirocumab 75 mg.  
From Week 12 (Visit 4), the Investigator will ma nage, based on his/her own judgment and LDL-C 
values, adjustment of alirocumab doses (either up-titration from 75 to 150 mg every 2 weeks or 
down-titration from 150 to 75 mg every 2 weeks, or maintenance of the dose, will be possible).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 26 The study consists of: 
x An open-label treatment period with alirocumab of up to 168 weeks, ie approximately 3.5 
years, for the first patients enrolled, or until the product becomes commercially available for the patient in the country, whatever comes first. 
x A post-treatment safety follow up period of 10 week-duration after last IMP injection for 
all the patients, the patients who will comple te the study and the patients who will early 
discontinue whatever the reason.  
Although the background therapies, statin at MTD or other LMT (if applicable), should be maintained stable if possible, they might be adjusted based on Investigator judgment, in particular in case of tolerability issue. The reasons of any adjustment should be documented and recorded in the e-CRF. 
For adjustments based on LDL-C values, simultaneous adjustments in alirocumab dose and any 
LMT should be avoided.   
Patients will be asked to continue  to follow a stable diet (equivalent to the National Cholesterol 
Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (NCEP ATP III 
TLC) during the study.  
Patients will return for regular on site visits according to the flow chart for additional laboratory 
testing, questionnaires, clinical examination and IMP dispensation. 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
The OLE study is planned to be completed in second quarter 2017 which corresponds to a study 
duration of approximately 168 weeks for the first patients enrolled or until the drug is commercially available for the patient in the respective country, whatever comes first. For patients in the UK, the study will last a maximum of 176 weeks.  
The study duration includes up to approximately 3.5 years of treatment for the first patients 
enrolled, and 10 weeks of follow up after the last IM P injection for all the patients, those who will 
complete the study and those who will early discontinue whatever the reason. 
The study will be considered as completed for a patient in the following situations: 
x When the alirocumab is commercially available in the patient’s country 
x In second quarter 2017, if alirocumab is not yet commercially available in the patient’s 
country  
An EOT visit will be done 2 weeks after the last IMP injection and a safety follow up call 10 weeks after the last IMP injection.

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Sterile alirocumab drug product will be supplied at a concentration of 75 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL 
in histidine, pH 6.0, polysorbate 20, and sucrose, both as 1 mL volume in an auto-injector (AI). 
Unlike the patients from the other studies, the patients from the ODYSSEY Long Term study used 
a different device (a prefilled syringe) in the parent study, and thus will have the possibility to perform on Visit 1 (Day 1) a placebo, self-injection training, using an auto-injector, before the first alirocumab administration.  
Injection for training: Sterile placebo for alirocumab will be prepared in the same formulation as 
alirocumab without the addition of protein as 1 mL volume in an auto-injector, for those patients willing to perform injection training. 
Note: Only in the event the manufacturer faces any performance or supply issues of the auto-
injector, contingency alternatives are the following ones, in order to ensure the continuity of the 
study treatment without interruption: 
x In case of disruption of the 150 mg auto-injector
, and the use of 75 mg auto-injectors is 
maintained: 
- patients receiving the 150 mg dose will need to administer 2 injections of 75 mg as 1 
mL each in an auto-injector, 
OR 
- patients will be switched to the use of prefilled syringes of 150 mg, with one injection 
of 1 mL.  
x In case of disruption of either 75 mg or both auto-injectors , patients will be switched to the 
use of prefilled syringes of 75 mg and 150 mg, with one injection of 1 mL for each of these doses. 
Should this occur, the alternative investigational medicinal product will be maintained until the end of the study. 
8.1.1 Route and method of administration 
A manual for IMP administration (injection instru ction manual) will be provided to patients 
containing detailed instructions on use, in particular for the patients having participated in the ODYSSEY Long Term study, for which the device was a prefilled syringe. Also, an administration package containing gauzes, alcohol swabs, band aids, etc. will be provided to the 
patients.

alirocumab - LTS13463 Version number: 1  
 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 31 The IMP could be administered by self-injection or by another designated person (such as a 
spouse, relative, etc…). The used auto-injector will be discarded in a sharps container which will be provided to patients. It is recommended that the s ubcutaneous IMP injections be rotated within 
an anatomical area (eg, right thigh then left thigh or right abdomen then left abdomen). Patients 
also have the option to inject in a different anatomical area (eg, thigh then abdomen) during the 
study. 
If another concomitant drug is being injected at the same site planned for the IMP injection, then 
the patient should be advised to use an alternate location for administration of the IMP. 
Patients will be asked to store the IMP in a refrigerator. Prior to administration, the IMP should be 
set outside in a safe location at room temperature for about 30 to 40 minutes. Thereafter, the IMP should be administered as soon as possible. 
Instructions as outlined above should be provided to the patient (or another designated person 
[such as spouse, relative, etc...] that will administer the injections) at training and as needed during the course of the study. Close supervision and feedback should be given at the first visit, 
and other visits as needed. Anyone that plans to administer the IMP must be trained by the study 
staff. 
8.1.2 Timing of administration 
On Day 1, visit 1, patients from the ODYSSEY Long Term study will have the possibility to perform a placebo, self-injection training using an auto-injector, before the first alirocumab 
injection. 
On the same day, the first alirocumab injection will be done at the site by the patient or another 
designated person (such as spouse, relative, etc) under direct site staff supervision. Patients will be monitored at the investigational site  for at least 30 minutes after this first injection in this study. 
Alirocumab subcutaneous injections will then be performed outside of the clinic, every two weeks 
up to the last injection planned in the protocol. If  the injection is scheduled to take place on the 
same date as the site visit, then the IMP should be administered after the blood sampling has been completed. 
Alirocumab should ideally be administered subcutaneously every two weeks at approximately the 
same time of the day. The time of the day is based upon patient’s preference; however it is 
acceptable to have a window period of ± 3 days.  
If by mistake or due to other circumstances an injection is delayed: 
x by more than 7 days or completely missed, then the patient should return to the original 
schedule of study treatment administration without administering delayed injections.  
x by less than or equal to 7 days from the missed date, then the patient should administer the delayed injection and then resume the original schedule of study treatment administration.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 32 8.2 NON-INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
The following classes of drugs are identified as non-IMP because the medication is either a 
background therapy or a potential rescue medication: 
x Statins  
x Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe) 
x Bile acid-binding sequestrants (such as c holestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam) 
x Nicotinic acid 
x Fenofibrate 
x Omega-3 fatty acids ( 1000 mg daily) 
Please see Section 8.8 for further information. 
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
From Day 1 (visit 1) until Week 8 (first unblinded LDL-C value),  
x neither the treatment received during the double-blind treatment period of the parent study, 
x nor the lipid parameters levels,  
will be known by the Investigator and by the patient, in order to prevent any potential to jeopardize the blinding of the parent clinical study. 
From Week 8 (visit 3), the lipid parameters values  will be communicated to the Investigator in 
real time. 
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
This is an open-label study and every patient will receive alirocumab. Treatment kit numbers will 
be allocated via interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Patients will keep the same identification number that they were allocated in the parent study. 
From Week 12 (Visit 4), the Investigator will ma nage, based on his/her own judgment and LDL-C 
value from sample obtained at the previous scheduled visit, adjustment of alirocumab doses 
(either up-titration from 75 mg to 150 mg every 2 weeks or down-titration  from  150 mg to 75 mg every 2 weeks, or maintenance of the dose, will be possible).  For adjustments based on LDL-C 
values, simultaneous adjustments in alirocumab dose and any LMT should be avoided. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
Each alirocumab treatment kit will be prepared to contain 6 auto-injectors in a child-resistant 
package.

be prepared for the purpose of instructing patients on injection administration, in particular for 
patients originating from the ODYSSEY Long Term study. 
The content of the labeling is in accordance with the local regulatory specifications and 
requirements.  
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
The IMP will be stored in a refrigerator between +2°C and + 8°C (36°F to 46° F) by the site. The 
temperature of the site refrigerator should be checked daily and recorded on a log sheet. 
The IMP that will be stored at the investigational site should be kept in an appropriate locked 
room, under the responsibility of the Investigator or designee or other authorized person in 
accordance with the storage conditions indicated on the label. 
After the supply of IMP kits to patients at the study site visits, appropriate provisions will be in 
place for transportation of the IMP kits from the study site to the patient’s refrigerator. 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained as specified by the Sponsor and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be s ubject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the Sponsor, in order to recall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
IMP administration data will be recorded by the patients onto a patient’s diary. 
Measures taken to ensure and document IMP compliance and accountability are described below:

he/she will dispense the treatme nt kit(s) to the patient. 
x The accountability is to be performed at IMP kit re-supply visits only (see Section 10.1.1). 
The used kit(s) and unused auto-injector(s) should be brought back to such visits for 
accountability purposes. 
x The Investigator or designee will complete the corresponding treatment log form from 
patient’s diary. 
x The Investigator/study coordinator will enter data in the appropr iate e-CRF pages, 
according to data recorded in the treatment log form. 
x The monitor will check the data consistency between e-CRF pages, treatment log forms 
using patient’s diary, and returned unused auto-injectors of a corresponding kit. 
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by the Investigator and the monitoring team. The Investigator will not destroy the unused IMP unless the Sponsor provides written authorization. 
If the site is not able to destroy or destruction of IMPs are not allowed in the country, all 
treatments kits will be retrieved by the Sponsor. A detailed treatment log of the returned IMP will 
be established with the Investigator or designee and countersigned by the Investigator and the 
Monitoring Team. 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient concomitantly to the study drug until the end of the patient’s  participation in the study. 
Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study. However, if these are considered necessary for the patient’s welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the IMP, they may 
be given at the discretion of the Investigator, with a stable dose (when possible). Besides the specific information related to concomitant medications provided in this section, any other concomitant medication(s) w ill be allowed and will ha ve to be recorded in the e-CRF and source 
data. 
8.8.1 Management of background lipid-modifying therapy 
Throughout the whole treatment period, the patients should stay, as far as possible, on the stable maximally tolerated registered daily dose of statins, with or without other LMT, that was received during the parent study.  
Background LMT may be adjusted as per the Investigator’s judgment, for example in case of 
tolerability issue. Any adjustment will be doc umented in the e-CRF. For adjustments based on 
LDL-C values, simultaneous adjustments in alirocumab dose and any LMT should be avoided.

during this period will be reported and reco rded in the parent study data base. 
x TEAE period:  the TEAE (Treatment Emergent Adverse Event) observation period is 
defined as the time from first dose of aliroc umab in the OLE up to 70 days (10 weeks) 
after the last dose of alirocumab received in the OLE study for the patients who will either 
complete the study or who will prematurely discontinue, as residual effect of treatment is expected until 10 weeks after the stop of alirocumab. 
x Post-treatment period : the post-treatment obser vation period is defined as the time starting 
the day after the end of the TEAE period up to the end of the study (see definition in section 6.2.1). 
Death observation period: 
The death observations are per the observation period defined above. In addition, “post-study” 
death includes all deaths reported after the end of the study (see definition of end of study period 
per patient in Section 6.2.1). 
9.1.1 Adverse events 
All adverse events diagnosed by the inve stigator will be re ported and described. 
All AEs will be coded to a “Lowest Level Term (LLT)”, “Preferred Term (PT)”, “High Level

The analysis windows used to allocate a time point to a measurement will be defined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
9.2.2 Efficacy assessment method 
Total-C, HDL-C, TG, Apo B, Apo A-1, and Lp (a ) will be directly measured by the Central 
Laboratory as per the schedule in Section 1.2. LDL-C will be calculated using the Friedewald formula ( 12) at all visits. If TG values exceed 400 mg/dL (4.52 mmol/L) then the central lab will 
reflexively measure (via the beta quantification method) the LDL-C rather than calculating it. Non-HDL-C will be calculated by  subtracting HDL-C from the total-C. Ratio Apo B/Apo A-1 
will be calculated. Detailed procedures of sample preparation, storage and shipment will be described in the specific laboratory manual whic h will be provided to sites. Information on the 
processing, methodology and other relevant information will be available upon request, in The Medpace Reference Laboratory Manual. 
Efficacy endpoints will not be considered as Adverse Events, such as those involving 
abnormalities in lipid levels, unless meeting the criteria in Section 10.4.2.

For all visits after Day 1/Week 0 (first visit), a time window of ± 7 days during the whole 
treatment period, including the follow-up call as applicable) will be allowed.  
For all visits after Day 1/first visit, if one visit date is changed, then the next visit should take 
place according to the original schedule as outlined Section 1.2. 
Blood samplings: 
The blood sampling for determination of lipid parameters (ie, total-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, non- 
HDL-C, Apo B, Apo A-1, ratio Apo B/Apo A-1, Lp [a]) should be performed in the morning, in 
fasting condition (ie overnight, at least 10-12 hours fast and refrain from smoking) for all site visits requiring blood sampling throughout the study. Alcohol consumption within 48 hours and intense physical exercise within 24 hours preceding the blood sampling are discouraged. 
Note: if the patient is not in fasting conditions, the blood sample will not be collected and a new 
appointment will be given the closest as possible to the date of this visit) to the patient with instruction to be fasted (see above conditions). 
Laboratory tests: 
The laboratory data are collected in accordance with the study schedule in Section 1.2 and 
forwarded to the central laboratory: 
x Hematology
: blood cell count including hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, red 
blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte count, white blood cell count with differential 
count and platelets 
x Chemistry : glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorous, urea 
nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, total protein, LDH, albumin, and ȖGT 
x Liver panel : ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin; in case of total bilirubin values above 
the normal range, differentiation into conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin will occur 
automatically. 
x Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK). 
x Local urine pregnancy test. 
Decision trees for the management of certain labo ratory abnormalities by Sanofi are provided in 
Appendix C  and Appendix D .

Physical examination: 
A general physical examination should be performed at the time points indicated in the study 
schedule flowchart in Section 1.2.  If a new clinically significant abnormality or worsening from baseline is detected after informed consent signed, then an AE should be reported and the patient should be considered for further clinical investigations and/or specialist consultation as per the Investigator’s medical judgment. 
Blood pressure (BP)/heart rate: 
BP should be measured in sitting position under standardized conditions, approximately at the 
same time of the day, on the same  arm, with the same apparatus (after the patient has rested 
comfortably in sitting position for at least five mi nutes). Values are to be recorded in the e-CRF; 
both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure should be recorded.  
Throughout the OLE study, blood pressure should be measured on the same arm as the one used 
in the parent study. 
Heart rate will be measured at the time of the measurement of blood pressure. Notes: in case of high BP values at first visit the Investigator is responsible for the optimization of 
the patient’s treatment to achiev e BP targets as defined by loca l guidelines or the Seventh Report 
of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) ( 14). 
Body weight: 
Body weight should be obtained with the patient wearing undergarments or very light clothing 
and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The same scale should be used throughout the study.

10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be determined whether the stop can be made temporarily or permanently according to the context. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF and source notes.  
Pregnancy will lead to definitive treatment discontinuation in all cases. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation (also referred  to as treatment interruption) may be 
considered by the Investigator because of susp ected AEs. Reinitiating of treatment with the IMP 
will be done under close and appropriate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring once the 
Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the 
responsibility of the IMP in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section 7.1 and Section 7.2). 
All treatment interruption duration should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate e-CRF screens when considered as confirmed.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 57 Treatment interruption is defined as one or more scheduled injections that are not administered to 
the patient as decided by the Investigator. 
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation (also referred to as treatment discontinuation) is any treatment discontinuation associated with the de finitive decision from the Investigator or the 
patient not to re-expose the pa tient to the IMP at any time. 
Patient withdrawal from the study treatment or study should be avoided as much as possible. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
Patients should discontinue the IMP for the following reasons: 
x Pregnancy, intention for pregnancy, or no longer with effective contraceptive method of 
birth control (females only). 
x Acute injection reaction of clinical concern. 
x Serious adverse event (or non-serious but severe in intensity) of hypersensitivity reaction considered related to IMP. 
x At patient request. 
x If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation with the administration of the IMP would be detrimental to the patient's well-being. 
x Intercurrent condition that requires discontinuation of the IMP (eg, laboratory 
abnormalities, please refer to decision tree Appendix C). 
x Any abnormal laboratory value will be immediately rechecked for confirmation before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned patient 
x At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment (regardless of the reason) should undergo an unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at the end of treatment visit (it should take place within 5 days of treatment discontinuation, if possible).  
The patient, at a minimum, should then be followed up for at least 10 weeks from last study 
treatment administration or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed-up as 
specified in this protocol, whichever comes last.

All definitive discontinuation of study treatment should be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate screens of the e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as 
confirmed. IVRS/IWRS should be notified when a patient prematurely discontinues study 
treatment. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study  
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason. If possible, the patients should be assessed using the 
procedure defined above. 
All study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate screens of the e-
CRF and in the patient’s medical records (with, in th is medical records, at least date of withdrawal 
and reason for) when considered as confirmed. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Investigator should make the best effort to re-contact 
the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact such patient s must be documented in the patie nt’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter)  
Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be included in the study again. Their 
inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused.  
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
Please refer to Appendix B  for Adverse Event (AE) reporting requirements. 
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death, or 
x Is life-threatening, or 
(electronic

alirocumab - LTS13463 Version number: 1  
 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 59 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
x Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or 
x Results in persistent or sign ificant disability/incapacity, or 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is a medically important event 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important ev ents is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which condition has to be considered as a medically important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
  Allergic bronchospasm  
  Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
  Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
- Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
- ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or  asymptomatic ALT increase >10 x ULN 
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality 
- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of blood sampling) 
- Bullous cutaneous eruptions 
- Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study  
- Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study. 
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are AEs (serious or non-serious) that need to be monitored, documented, and managed in a pre-specified manner described in the protocol. Please see Section 10.4.4 for additional information. 
10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
x All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP, spanning from the signature of 
the informed consent form of the current stud y until the end of the study as defined by the 
protocol for that patient, are to be recorded on the corresponding screen(s) of the e-CRF.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 60 x Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, add itional investigations performed, outcome, 
and his/her opinion as to whether there is a r easonable possibility that the AE was caused 
by the IMP.  
x The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laborat ory results have returned to nor mal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that 
observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
x When treatment is prematurely  discontinued, the patient’s obs ervations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient. 
x Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective treatment or consultation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI  
See Appendix B  for a summary of AE reporting guidelines. 
10.4.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator must immediately: 
x ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after 
approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay. 
x SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocopy of all examinations carried out and the dates on which these examinations were performed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email address appear on the clinical trial protocol. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
x All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional inform ation (for laboratory data, concomitant 
medications, patient status, etc) should be sent (by fax or e-mail) to the monitoring team within 24 hours of knowledge. In addition, every effort should be made to further 
document any SAE that is fatal or life threat ening within a week (7 days) of the initial 
notification.

Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigato r at any time after the end of the study for the 
patient and considered by him/her to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team. 
10.4.4 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest   
10.4.4.1 AESI with immediate notification: 
For these AEs, the Sponsor will be informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAEs 
notification described in Section 10.4.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the corresponding screens in the e-CRF. 
x ALT3 ULN (if baseline ALT<ULN) Or ALT 2 times the baseline value (if baseline 
ALTULN) (Please refer to related flowchart in Appendix C ). Baseline to be considered 
is the baseline of the current study. 
x Allergic events 
- Allergic drug reactions and/or local injection site reactions deemed to be allergic (or 
have an allergic component) that require consultation with another physician for 
further evaluation of hypersensitivity/alle rgy, as per the investigator's medical 
judgment or as per Section 10.6.2, should be reported as an AESI with immediate 
notification. 
- All allergic events, and all in jection site reactions having an allergic component or 
deemed to be allergic, require completion of the specific e-CRF screen (see Section 
10.6.2), regardless of requirements for immediate reporting. 
x Hemolytic anemia (See Section 10.4.5.1 and Appendix D ) 
- If there is a decrease in hemoglobin and reflexive testing as per Appendix D 
suggesting hemolysis, then report this as an AESI with immediate notification. Special e-CRF screen will need to be completed. 
x Pregnancy 
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient included in the clinical trial. 
  Pregnancy will be recorded as a pre-specified AE with immediate notification in 
all cases. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria. 
  IMP should be discontinued. 
  The follow-up of the pregnancy will be  mandatory until the outcome has been 
determined. 
- Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a male patient included in the clinical trial. If 
permitted by the female partner and by local regulatory policies,

all cases. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria. 
  The follow-up of the pregnancy will be  mandatory until the outcome has been  
determined. 
x Symptomatic Overdose with IMP 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) is an event suspected by the Investigator or 
spontaneously notified by the patient (not based on systematic injection counts) and 
defined as at least twice of the intended dose within the intended therapeutic interval (ie, 2 or more injections from the treatment kit are administered in <7 calendar days); to be reported using the corresponding screens in the e-CRF using the Term ‘Symptomatic OVERDOSE (accidental [or intentional])’. The patient should be monitored and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted. 
- The circumstances of the overdose should be clearly specified in the verbatim. 
x Neurologic Events 
- Neurologic Events that require additional examinations/procedures and/or referral to a 
specialist should be reported immediately (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAEs notification described in Section 10.4.1.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion. 
x Ophthalmologic Events 
- Ophthalmologic Events that require additional examinations/procedures and/or referral 
to a specialist should be reported immediately (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAEs 
notification described in Section 10.4.1.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion. 
10.4.4.2 AESI without immediate notification: 
x Asymptomatic Overdose with IMP 
An overdose is defined in the above section. 
In case of an asymptomatic overdose with IMP, the event should be reported using the 
corresponding screens in the e-CRF using the Term “Asymptomatic OVERDOSE (accidental [or intentional])”. The patient should be monitored for any adverse events and treated, as 
needed 
x Local injection site reactions (see section 10.6.1) 
Local injection site reactions that are considered as non-allergic events and that are related to 
the IMP injection, as opposed to another injectable agent, should be further characterized by evaluating the related symptoms that comprise an injection site reaction such as but not 
limited to redness, pain, etc (See Appendix F ). Special e-CRF screens will need to be 
completed. If such an AE were to occur, then do not report the individual components of the reaction but rather the term “local injection site reaction”, with the individual components being described in the specific e-CRF screen. 
x Allergic events not referred for consultation with another physician (see above section)

x Thrombocytopenia 
x Increase in ALT 
x Acute renal insufficiency 
x Decrease in hemoglobin (defined as 1.5 g/dL) 
x Increase in CPK and suspicion of rhabdomyolysis. 
10.4.5.1 Hemoglobin decrease 
At the first post-inclusion occurrence of a hemoglobin (Hb) measurement decrease by 1.5 g/dL 
as compared to the first visit (in the current study) hemoglobin measurement, then the Central Lab will reflexively measure haptoglobin using specim ens already obtained at the same time point for 
which the hemoglobin decrease was detected. The Central Lab will provide the results of the reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, LDH and indirect bilirubin [reflexively measured only if the total bilirubin >ULN] to the investigator (see Appendix D ). 
x If the following pattern of abnormalities is noted: 
- Reticulocyte count >Central Lab’s upper limit of the reference range (also referred to 
as ULN) AND 
- Haptoglobin <Central Lab’s lower limit of the reference range (also referred to as LLN) AND 
- LDH>ULN AND 
- Indirect bilirubin >ULN (only if the total bilirubin >ULN),

peripheral blood smear and anti-erythrocyte antibodies (direct and indirect) by Coombs test. Further investigations are at  the discretion of the hematologist. 
x If the results are normal or the pattern of abnormality is something other than that 
described above, then the Investigator should exercise his/her medical judgment in the 
interpretation of the results, necessity for workup of the decrease in hemoglobin or referral 
to a hematologist. 
If a second hemoglobin measurement demonstrating a further decrease of 1 g/dL from the last 
available value is observed, even if the previous work-up was negative, the same investigations 
can be repeated and a hematology consultation can be requested at the discretion of the Investigator or at the Sponsor's request.  
10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
x all SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IMP (Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Re action; SUSAR), to the Health Authorities, IECs/IRBs as 
appropriate and to the Investigators.  
x all SAEs that are expected and at least re asonably related to the IMPs to the Health 
Authorities, according to local regulations. 
In this study, some AEs are considered related to the underlying condition and thus will not be 
considered unexpected, as given in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol 
will be considered unexpected. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical 
study report (CSR). 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Local tolerability (Local Injection Site Reactions) 
In case the Investigator or the patient recognizes any signs of local intolerability, then this should 
be treated and followed up as per the investigator’s medical judgment. See Appendix F  for further 
information. 
10.6.2 Allergic adverse events  
Specific e-CRF screens are to be filled in to assess allergic reactions or allergic-like reactions that 
may occur during the clinical studies conducted with alirocumab.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 65 Sometimes transient injection site reactions, irritant in nature, may occur, requiring no 
intervention and being of dubious significance. These reactions would not be considered to be allergic reactions. 
Adverse events that may constitute an allergic  reaction (eg, generalize d itch, nasal itch, swelling 
at injection site, flushing, hives, swelling at lips,  eyes, face, tongue, hands, feet, lump in throat, 
difficulty to swallow, hoarseness, change in pitch of voice, incapacity to speak, wheezing, chest 
tightness, stridor, etc) should be considered to be reported on the General Allergic Reaction and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form (see Section 10.4.4). 
Adverse events that are obviously not of allergic origin (eg, local injection site reactions) should only be recorded on the Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form. However, injection site reactions which progress/expand/worsen/etc should be evaluated as recommended in 10.6.2.1 
and General Allergic Reaction Complementary form should be completed. (See Sections 10.4.4) 
The IMP should be immediately interrupted (temporarily discontinued) if there is a suspicion of an allergic event related to IMP.  See Section 10.3.1 for further information on treatment 
interruption and Section 10.3.3 for criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation. 
10.6.2.1 Allergic events with cutaneous involvement 
Adverse events with cutaneous involvement which are obviously of allergic origin or injection site reactions which progress/expand/worsen/etc should be evaluated by a dermatologist as soon as possible, and preferably within one week of the site first becoming aware of the event. 
The investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (new medications, etc) and 
extra-cutaneous symptoms and signs. An unscheduled Central Laboratory assessment for hematology, chemistry, liver panel and ADA should be obtained. If it is possible, the site will take pictures of the skin lesions in order to provide the patient with them for the dermatologist’s visit. 
If the photos are obtained, then copies should be kept as source documents which may later be 
collected by the sponsor.  The investigator will provide a summary of the patient's case, reason for consultation, and information being requested to the consulting dermatologist. 
A full consultation report should be sent by the dermatologist to the investigator. The full report 
should contain, at a minimum, the following information; a detailed description of the rash (such as the morphology [lesion type], shape of individual lesions, arrangement of multiple lesions [eg, 
scattered, grouped, linear, etc.], distribution, color, consistency, presence of pruritus or pain, and 
other clinical signs) and in case a skin biopsy (including histopathology and immunofluorescence) was done (if it was deemed necessary as per the dermatologist’s or investigator’s medical judgment), the results of this investigation w ith, if applicable, a specific diagnosis of the AE. The 
investigator will fax the full report and the corrected AE form if necessary, to the Monitoring Team Representative within 24 hours.

Acute allergic injection reaction (which are considered under the category of general allergic 
reactions) is defined as any AE that occurs during or shortly after injection of the IMP (characterized by but not limited to hypotension, bronchoconstriction, urticaria, edema, angioedema, nausea, vomiting). Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of these potential adverse effects (eg, antihistamines, br onchodilators, IV saline, corticosteroids, 
acetaminophen, and epinephrine) must be available for immediate use for the injections at the training, and randomization visits. (See Section 10.4.2) 
Patients will be observed at the i nvestigational site for at least 30 minutes following the injection 
that takes place at the randomization visit. Patients should be treated symptomatically if any AEs are observed. Patients are to remain at the site until any acute injection reaction is assessed as stable, per the Investigator’s discretion. General Allergic Reaction and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form will have to be completed.

The total exposure will be assessed by: 
x Duration of alirocumab exposure in weeks defi ned as: (last aliroc umab injection date 
+ 14 -first alirocumab injection date) / 7, regardless of unplanned intermittent discontinuations. 
x The total number of injections by patient. 
11.4.1.2 Compliance 
Compliance will be assessed using the following parameters: 
x The mean injection frequency will be defined for each patient as the average number of 
days between 2 consecutive injections, that is: (last dose date – first dose date)/(number of 
injections -1). 
This parameter will be summa rized descriptively (N, Mea n, SD, Median, Min and Max). 
x The overall compliance will be defined for each patient as: 100 - (% days with under-planned dosing + % days with above-planned dosing). Under-planned and above-planned dosing will be defined as follows, considering that injections should be performed every 2 weeks (+ - 3 days): 
x The %days with under-planned dosing will be defined for each patient as the number of days with no injection administered within the previous 17 days divided by the duration of IMP injection exposure in days. For example, if a patient takes a dose 18 days after his/her previous injection, then 1 day is counted as a day under-planned dosing. 
x The %days with above-planned dosing will be  defined for each patient as the number 
of days with more than one injection administered within the 11 days before divided by the duration of IMP injection exposure in days. For example, if a patient takes a dose 9 days after his/her previous injection, then 2 days are counted as a days above-planned dosing.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 69 11.4.2 Analyses of safety endpoints 
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population using the following common rule:  
The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before first injection. For 
analyses of changes from baseline for laboratory and vital signs parameters, baseline of the parent 
study or of the current study (ie value at visit 1 before the first injection) may be considered. 
The safety analysis will focus on the Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) period defined 
as the time from the first dose of the current study to the last dose of IMP + 70 days (10 weeks).  
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters  and vital signs. 
The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal values 
considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined criteria/thresholds based 
on literature review and defined by the Sponsor for clinical laboratory tests and vital signs. 
PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the TEAE period, taking 
into account all evaluations performed during the TEAE period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations.  The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the PCSA 
percentage.   
Treatment period: the treatment period used for quantitative analysis is defined as the time from 
first dose of IMP injection to the last dose of IMP injection + 21 days.  
AE definition: 
x Pre-treatment AEs are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
PRE-TREATMENT period; 
x Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the TEAE period; 
x Post-treatment AEs are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the POST-TREATMENT period. 
Drug-induced liver injury: 
Liver function tests, namely ALT, AST, alkalin e phosphatase and total bilirubin, are used to 
assess possible drug-induced liver toxicity. The proportion of patients with PCSA values at any 
post-baseline visit by baseline status will be displayed by treatment group for each parameter. A graph of distribution of peak values of ALT vers us peak values of total bilirubin will also be 
presented. Note that the ALT and total bilirubin va lues are presented on a logarithmic scale. The 
graph will be divided into 4 quadrants with a vertical line corresponding to 3 x ULN for ALT and a horizontal line corresponding to 2 x ULN for total bilirubin.

preferred terms will be based on standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) Hepatic disorder. Time to 
liver-related treatment discontinuation and time to liver death may also be provided based on hepatic disorder SMQ. 
11.4.2.1 Adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by system organ class (SOC) (sorted by 
internationally agreed order), high-level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE.  Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted only once in 
the tables within a treatment phase. The denominator for computation of percentages is the safety 
population. 
Adverse event incidence table will be provided fo r all types of TEAEs: a ll TEAEs, all treatment 
emergent AESI, all treatment emergent SAEs and all TEAEs leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation. If any clinically significant signal is detect ed and need further characterization or for adverse 
event of clinical interest, exploration of time to onset could be performed for these selected 
TEAEs as described below to account for the differential exposure time in all patients. 
Selected TEAEs will be also analyzed using time-to-event approach (Kaplan-Meier 
methodology). Time from the first dose of IMP injection to the first occurrence of the event will 
be calculated (only the first event will be counted). Patients without any event will be censored 
at the end of the TEAE period. Incidence rates at different time points of exposure will be presented and Kaplan-Meier curves will be provided. 
Death: 
The following deaths summaries will be generated: 
x Number (%) of patients who died by study period (TEAE, on-study, post-study) 
summarized on the safety population  
x TEAE leading to death (death as an outcome on the AE CRF page as reported by the Investigator) by primary SOC , HLGT, HLT and PT showing number (%) of patients 
sorted by internationally agreed order of SOC and alphabetic order of HLGT, HLT, and

 Abstract  
 
Provide a summary of the study (recommended length: less than 50 0 words).  
 
Colorectal cancer is a common but preventable condition, and increasing 
colorectal cancer screening is one of the most impactful public health contributions in 
the field of gastroenterology. Text messaging  is a simple, cheap, and rapid method to 
reach patients that  may improve adherence to colonoscopy appointments as well as 
simplify the process of bowel preparation.  
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a pilot bidirectional 
text messaging intervention on attendance for screening/surveillance 
colonoscopy and bowel preparation quality at an urban VA hospital.  The goal is 
to improve adherence to colonoscopy among patients who are due for a repeat colonoscopy.  
The primary outcomes are process feasibility measures including 
recruitment rate, refusal rate for participation, and retention rate through end of study.  
The secondary outcomes include documenting the proportion of patients 
who attended their scheduled colonoscopy appointment in the intervention group vs. the control group as well as documenting the proportion of patients with adequate bowel preparation between the two groups. We will also document the number of patients who responded to the National Annie Survey.

2.0 Introduction  
 
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 5 of 20 
 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in 
the US. Despite overwhelming evidence that screening reduces both CRC 
incidence and mortality, the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System estimates that only 72% of eligible adults aged 50- 75 years are up- to-date with 
screening in the US. These figures overestimate the proportion of Americans who receive adequate long- term protection from CRC because they are based 
on a one- time (i.e., cross -sectional) measurement in a single year. The protective 
effect of screening diminishes over time; thus, national recommendations emphasize the importance of repeated testing—with fecal occult blood and 
immunochemical testing (FOBT/FIT) annually or colonoscopy every 10 years —to 
obtain the full intended benefits of a screening program.  
 
The vast majority of patients undergoing CRC screening at the VA New York Harbor Health Care System (NYHHCS) receive colonoscopy, and a national VA study found that 38% of appointments made at colonoscopy -performing clinics 
following a positive FOBT were missed, cancelled, or rescheduled.2 Late cancellations and nonattendance at colonoscopy is a major source of inefficiency that wastes precious endoscopic resources, and more importantly non-adherence to screening guidelines places individuals at greater ris k for 
developing CRC. One strategy to reduce appointment wait times and increase screening rates is to both remind patients of their upcoming colonoscopy and guide them through the bowel preparation process. Of the various interventions that have been used to improve CRC screening, text messaging is especially 
appealing because of its low cost, widespread use, and ability to deliver real -time 
information in a visible yet discreet manner. In 2012, the Community Preventive 
Services Task Force found strong evidence to recommend using reminders to 
increase FOBT screening but found insufficient evidence to do so for colonoscopy.3 Additionally, the effectiveness of newer communication methods such as text messaging was identified as a research gap. Since then, data has shown that text messaging is an acceptable method to promote CRC screening,4 and interest for health- related text messaging is high even in vulnerable 
populations such as homeless V eterans.5 Text messaging has been shown to 
increase adherence to FIT by up to 24%,6 while the only study to include colonoscopy found a modest 3% improvement.7 However, the latter was conducted in an Alaskan tribal health care system with culturally -tailored 
messaging, and therefore the results may not be generalizable to the broader US population.  
Our prior study found that text message reminders for CRC screening is less effective than for breast or cervical cancer screening, and this is likely due to the substantial difference in patient preparation required for the respective examinations.8 Unlike screening for breast and cervical cancer or using FIT, colonoscopy involves a complex multi -day preparation process that includes 
dietary restrictions and drinking a large volume oral laxative on a strict schedule. Poor bowel preparation quality leads to an inadequate colonoscopic examination 
that must be repeated,9 which in terms of clinical outcome is equivalent to 
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 6 of 20 
 nonattendance at colonoscopy. Therefore, assessment of attendance must also 
include an assessment of bowel preparation. A Korean study showed that an educational text message can improve bowel preparation quality.10 Patient navigation is another method that can provide bowel preparation education and has been proven to be effective at increasing CRC screening, but many institutions are unable to implement navigator programs due to cost.11,12 A bidirectional or two -way text messaging platform, in which patients have the 
ability to both receive and respond to messages, would provide a low -cost 
method of patient engagement that may achieve a benefit similar to conventional patient navigators. Two- way text messaging has been shown to be significantly 
more effective than one- way messaging for improving medication adherence.13 
However, all text messaging interventions for CRC screening to date have used one-way messaging to simply encourage patients to undergo screening or 
remind them of their appointment. The one- way study design does not take 
advantage of the instantaneous and interactive nature of mobile messaging, which sets it apart from letters, telephone calls, or even emails. A bidirectional messaging platform can maximize the capability of this interactive medium by serving as both a procedure reminder and a virtual patient navigation system. Patients at NYHHCS often make last -minute cancellations because they forgot 
about the procedure or how to take the bowel preparation. Reminders that are sent with sufficient advance notice allow patients to cancel or reschedule and still permit another patient to use their original appointment time. In this way, it addresses a common systems -level failure to adequately notify and prepare 
patients for their upcoming procedure. More importantly, a series of messages closer to the procedure date can provide real -time instructions on the bowel 
preparation process and provide on- demand answers to frequently asked 
questions. Recent studies from the medication adherence literature demonstrate that real -time text messaging significantly improves adherence and can lead to a 
durable effect for at least two years after an intervention.14,15 Thus, bidirectional text messaging may be especially effective for increasing colonoscopy rates by reminding patients of their appointment and improving the bowel preparation quality through virtual patient navigation. This intervention would also generate short -term downstream benefits by decreasing the number of procedures 
performed for inadequate bowel preparation and reducing wait -times for 
colonoscopy. It is also possible that the intervention may lead to greater awareness of colonoscopy as a potentially life- saving procedure that must be 
repeated over the long- term for maximum protective effec t. 
 
Our previous qualitative work at NYHHCS examined barriers and facilitators to undergoing repeat screening or surveillance colonoscopy for Veterans who were due for the procedure. In addition to conducting 45 semi -structured interviews, 
we also tested messages to promote CRC screening and colonoscopy in focus groups. Based on these results, we now propose to pilot test a bidirectional text messaging intervention for colonoscopy, which combines features of a clinical reminder system with virtual patient navigation that provides additional information on demand. We will use Annie (https://mobile.va.gov/app/annie- app-
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 7 of 20 
 clinicians), a text messaging service designed by the VA to help patients and 
their providers to promote self -care and improve health management.  
 
Only one study has examined the effect of text messaging on screening colonoscopy to date, and the results were modest but limited by lack of generalizability.7 Furthermore, this and most text messaging studies for cancer screening have not used a series of messages to prompt a complex set of actions in real -time (e.g. bowel preparation) nor allowed participants to request 
additional information on demand. The bidirectional text messaging platform is novel in that it will include both of these features, which mimic the characteristics of a human patient navigator. If the pilot test yields promising results that are subsequently confirmed in a larger efficacy trial, then low -cost virtual patient 
navigation using text messaging may become an accepted method to promote 
colorectal cancer screening and other preventive services.  
3.0 Objectives 
 
The objective of this study is to pilot test a text messaging intervention to 
improve adherence to colonoscopy among VA patients who are due for repeat 
screening/surveillance colonoscopy at the VA New York Harbor Health Care System (NYHHCS). The primary outcomes are process feasibility measures including recruitment rate, refusal rate for participation, and retention rate t hrough 
end of study.   
Hypothesis: The intervention will be feasible, and patients who receive the 
intervention will have higher attendance and better bowel preparation quality than those who do not.

5.0 Study Procedures  
5.1 Study Design  
All individuals who agree to participate in the study will provide written 
consent  and HIPAA authorization. A total of 50 consented participants will be 
randomized 1:1 to either the text messaging (intervention) group or the standard 
care (control) group. We will use block randomization with block sizes ranging from 2 to 6. The intervention group will receive a series of instructional and motivational text messages, which will be sent starting 7- 14 days before and until 
the day of the procedure.  
 
For instructional messages, earlier messages will remind patients of the 
colonoscopy appointment and later messages will help patients complete the 
bowel preparation process in real -time. Table 1 shows the timing and 
representative content of the instructional messages. Some messages may be 
sent over a range of days until the procedure, depending on when the participant enrolled and the type of bowel preparation (1 or 2 day) the participant is recommended to undergo. Table 2 provides a list of representative focus group tested motivational messages that will be sent along with instructional messages. The specific motivational messages will be tailored, whenever possible, based on the patient demographic traits (e.g., age, sex, and race and ethnicity).  
 
Due to character limits in Annie, longer messages may be sent as multiple 
texts. Some messages will be bidirectional, and participants will be able to 
respond to receive additional information. Additional information will be delivered automatically based on the participant’s response and does not need to be sent manually by the study team. The national Annie colonoscopy survey (Appendix) will be conducted within 7 days of the procedure date to assess patient satisfaction with the intervention.  
 
We will use the electronic health record to measure clinical secondary 
outcomes, such as the proportion of patients who 1) attend the scheduled 
colonoscopy appointment and 2) had adequate bowel preparation.  
 
• Study Timelines 
We estimate that we will need 3 months to enroll all participants and an 
additional 1 month to complete the intervention. Analysis will be completed within 
1 month. In all, the study will be completed in 5 months.

2 Colorectal cancer and colonoscopy:  “Cancers take years to 
develop, so the older you get, the higher probability, the better to 
have it done again.”  
3 Manhattan VA Veteran: “This thing (colorectal cancer) could kill 
you, and it's preventable if they catch it in time, and it just takes a few minutes…It would be stupid not to do it.” 
4 In 2023, more than 150,000 Americans will be diagnosed with 
colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 will die from this disease. Don’t be a statistic. Get screened for colorectal cancer.  
5 Myth: A colonoscopy takes too long, so it can wait.   
Fact: A colonoscopy usually takes about 30– 60 minutes and can 
prevent colorectal cancer (the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the US). Taking just a few hours out of your day can prevent a life with colorectal cancer.  
6 Myth: I don’t need a colonoscopy because I feel fine and don’t 
have any symptoms.  
Fact: Colorectal cancer usually does not cause symptoms at the early stage. When symptoms occur, the cancer may already be at a late stage. Colonoscopy can both prevent colorectal cancer and catch it before symptoms appear.  
7 When someone mentions colonoscopy, do you think about how 
much bowel prep you have to drink and feel unsure if you want the procedure?  
Actually, the volume of bowel prep has decreased by 50% over the years. You can also add flavoring to the solution to improve the taste. Think of bowel prep as a one -time cleaning in exchange 
for years of peace of mind that your colon is healthy.  
8 Myth: The colonoscopy is going to hurt.  
Fact: It is completely okay to have reservations and concerns 
about the procedure. You can request sedation during the 
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 11 of 20 
 colonoscopy, which will make you more comfortable. If you have 
questions about sedation, talk to your GI doctor or nurse.  
9 Myth: I’m not at risk for colorectal cancer, so I don’t need a 
colonoscopy  
Fact: 1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women will develop colorectal 
cancer in their lifetime. Many do not have any risk factors. But 
screening can prevent 60% of deaths from colorectal cancer. 
Don’t be a statistic.  
10 Myth: Colorectal cancer mainly affects men, so women don’t need 
a colonoscopy.  
Fact: Colorectal cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the USA. 1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women 
will develop colorectal cancer in their lifetime. Don’t take this 
chance.  
11 Myth: Colonoscopies are dangerous.   
Fact: Colonoscopies are very safe. The risk of perforation (tear) in 
the colon is less than 1 in 2,000 procedures. On the other hand, 1 
in every 24 people will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime.  
12 More than 52,000 people will die from colorectal cancer this year. 
You can prevent this. Your loved ones are counting on you. Don’t be a statistic, be a survivor.

Colorectal cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the 
US. 1 in 23 men and 1 in 25 women will develop colorectal cancer 
in their lifetime. Don’t be a statistic, be a survivor. Schedule a 
colonoscopy today and join Joanne and many others in a lif e 
without colorectal cancer.  
15 Did you know that colorectal cancer is the 3rd -leading cause of 
cancer death in both men and women in the United States? Colorectal cancer can be caught early or even prevented through 
regular screening. Most people should begin screening at age 45.  
16 Colorectal cancer is often a silent disease. Usually there are no 
symptoms. That’s why getting screened is so important. 
Screening can help prevent colorectal cancer or catch it early 
when it is easiest to treat. Most people should begin screening at age 45.  
17 Right now, you could have a polyp, a small growth in your colon or 
rectum. Right now, your polyp may be harmless, but over time it could develop into colorectal cancer. Right now, through regular screening, you have the power to find and remove precancerou s 
polyps and prevent colorectal cancer. Call your doctor and take control of your health!  
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 12 of 20 
 18 If you are 45 or older, you’re at a higher risk for colon cancer —
even if you are healthy. Ask your doctor for a screening test.  
19 Colon cancer starts with a polyp in the large intestine. Polyps are 
very common in people age 45 and older, but they can be 
detected and removed before they turn into cancer. Don’t die of cancer. Talk to your doctor about colon cancer prevention.  
20 You are so important to your family, don’t let them down! Don’t 
procrastinate any longer! Get screened for colon cancer today! It could save your life.  
21 Colon cancer is the 2nd leading cancer killer in the U.S., but it 
doesn’t have to be. Colon cancer can be prevented or found at an early stage. Getting screened is absolutely necessary! Call a doctor today.  
22 Screening can prevent colorectal cancer.

5.2 Recruitment Methods  
Patients undergoing repeat screening or surveillance colonoscopy at the 
VA NYHHCS are eligible. We plan to oversample female patients so that at least 20% of participants (10 individuals) are women. Participants will be recruited from a list of patients sc heduled for colonoscopy. Research team members will 
screen and identify eligible participants using the VA electronic medical records system (CRPS). Participants will be either recruited during their in -person pre-
colonoscopy clinic visit or through mailed invitations followed by up to 3 follow up 
phone calls.  This will be conducted by the research coordinator.  A research team 
member will explain the study to each potential participant  and obtain written 
consent and HIPAA authorization from the participant  in a private room to 
maintain patient privacy . For participants randomized to the intervention arm, a 
clinician member of the research team will obtain verbal consent from the patient to enroll in Annie, in accordance with requirements for who can consent when 
using Annie (https://mobile.va.gov/sites/default/files/annie- app-clinicians -quick -
start- guide-1- 3.pdf). Only individuals deemed to have capacity are eligible for 
study participation.  No vulnerable populations will be included.  
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 13 of 20 
 Participants will be responsible for the costs of the text messages they 
may receive as part of the intervention. Each participant will receive $40 in the 
form of a gift card or check  to compensate for their time. There are no additional 
costs to the participant.  
5.3 Informed Consent Procedures  
All patients will be required to provide written consent to participate in the 
study. This will be obtained by a member of the research team. A blank copy of 
the informed consent form will also be provided to participants for their records at the time they sign the consent.  All study personnel will have had up -to-date TMS 
and CITI trainings on how to obtain and document informed consent as well as regarding human subjects ’ protection requirements . 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families.  Consent forms will be IRB 
approved.  The investigator will explain the research study to the participant and 
answer any questions that may arise. All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions prior to signing the 
consent form. The participants will have the opportunity to discuss the study or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study.  
 
Signed consent  will be documented in the subject’s research record. The 
consent process, including the name of the individual obtaining consent, will be 
thoroughly documented in the subject’s research record . 
 
 
5.4 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
-Age 45- 85 years  
-Has previously undergone a colonoscopy and is currently due for a repeat 
screening or surveillance colonoscopy  at the VA.  
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 14 of 20 
  
Exclusion criteria:  
-Patients not due for screening or surveillance colonoscopy. This will be based 
on 2020 guidelines from the US Multi -Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer.  
-Patients with personal history of CRC/inflammatory bowel disease/ hereditary 
colon cancer syndrome or family history of hereditary colon cancer syndrome. 
These criteria will be determined based on ICD9/10 codes or the medical record.  
 
5.5 Study Evaluations  
 
The national Annie colonoscopy survey (Appendix) will be conducted 
within 7 days of the procedure date to assess patient satisfaction with the intervention. The survey will be sent by the research team  via Annie text 
messages and should take approximately 2 minutes to complete.  While the 
national Annie colonoscopy survey is also used by other VA facilities, the results from this study will not be shared.  
 
We will use the electronic health record to measure clinical secondary 
outcomes, such as the proportion of patients who 1) attend the scheduled colonoscopy appointment and 2) had adequate bowel preparation.  We will 
extract the following data: Names, MRN, date of birth, sex, race and ethnicity,  
telephone number, mailing address,  date of colonoscopy, Boston Bowel Prep 
Scale score, and colonoscopy findings.  
5.6 Data Analysis  
 
Data Analysis  
The primary feasibility will be evaluated with descriptive statistics. For the secondary 
efficacy outcomes, we will use the chi -squared or Fisher’s exact test to compare 
proportions in the two groups.  
 
Power calculations  
This pilot feasibility study will generate data that can be used to conduct a subsequent 
larger efficacy trial. Power calculations were not performed for the primary outcome. For 
the secondary outcome of colonoscopy attendance, based on the current 70% attendance at the study site, we will have 80% power to detect a 22% absolute increase 
in attendance in the intervention group, assuming a type I error of 10%.  
[Version 3 09/ 29/2023]   Page 15 of 20 
 5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects  
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time. For participants who 
withdraw, any data collected up to the time of withdrawal may still be retained 
and analyzed. Those who are randomized to the intervention arm can stop 
receiving messages at any point by texting “Stop” to Annie.  There will be no 
adverse consequence for a participant who decides to withdraw from the study.  
6.0 Reporting  
 
All unanticipated problems, serious adverse events, and protocol 
deviations  will be reported to the IRB . The PI is responsible for oversight of 
reporting any adverse events.  In the event on an adverse event  that is related to 
text messaging, messages will be stopped immediately on the Annie application if the participant is unsure how to text back, “Stop.” Any other adverse events will be addressed directly with patients and dealt with accordingly.  
The PI will be responsible for data monitoring. The PI will design the data 
collection instruments such that variable coding and data format are consistent. The PI 
will review all data collected on an ongoing basis (each month during the duration of the 
study) for data completeness and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. The PI will 
maintain exclusive control over individual permissions to access the research data.  
7.0 Privacy and Confidentiality 
 
The data will be accessed, analyzed, and stored on the secure VA 
network. Data will be password protected and stored in a secure folder on the VA 
Network. Hardcopy consent and HIPAA authorization forms will stored in a 
locked cabinet inside the PI’s locked office.  Names, MRN numbers, phone numbers, 
and addresses will be collected. This information is needed to mail invitation letters, make phone calls, and track patients in CPRS. 
 Dates will also be accessed in order to 
measure clinical secondary outcomes, such as the proportion of patients who attended 
the scheduled colonoscopy appointment. Only individuals with IRB approval  and 
listed in the protocol  will have access to the data. All personnel who work on this 
project will complete the necessary CITI and TMS training for research involving 
patient data.  Once all the data has been cleaned for analysis, any identifying 
patient information will be removed to further ensure confidentiality.  Data from 
this project may be published in aggregate, anonymous form. The study will be closed once all planned publications are completed. Upon completion of this project, the data will be stored for at least the minimum amount of time as stipulated by the IRB.  There is no plan to destroy collected data. No 
biospecimens are being collected for this study.

 8.0 Communication Plan 
 
All information regarding changes to the study will be kept up- to-date on 
IRBN et. In the rare chance of an Adverse Event, Unanticipated problems, or 
interim results, it will be reported to the VA IRB. All team members will have full 
knowledge of the IRB approved protocol and follow accordingly. All changes 
regarding protocol, informed consent , and HIPAA authorization will also be 
reported to the VA New York Harbor  IRB via IRBNet. There are no other VA 
facilities involved.  
 
9.0 Risks to Subjects  
The intervention being studied is a series of text messages. There is minimal risk, 
discomfort, or inconvenience to the participants. There is a small risk that the messages 
may be considered too numerous or intrusive. Participants will be reminded that they 
can stop participating in the research at any time and unenroll in Annie. There is also a 
small risk of breach of confidentiality, and all necessary precautions will be taken to 
prevent this . To ensure the that there is no breach in confidentiality, all patient 
information will be kept in password protected devices and encrypted folders at the VA. 
 
In thi
s study, participant will receive texting over mobile/cell phones and this method of 
communication may result in a breach of confidential information because text 
messages to mobile/cell phones are not encrypted. This means that information participants  send or receive by text message could be intercepted or viewed by an 
unintended recipient, or by the mobile/cell phone provider or carrier.  
 
10.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
For participants who were planning to cancel their colonoscopy or did not know how to do the 
bowel prep, the text messaging intervention may help them to prepare for and attend the 
procedure. Obtaining a colonoscopy has been proven to lower the risk of colorectal cancer , 
which is a potential benefit to participants . If the intervention is shown to be effective, then it 
may be adopted at other institutions and increase colonoscopy uptake in the general population. 
It would also contribute to generalizable knowledge by showing that text messages can improve colonoscopy attendance and bowel preparation quality.

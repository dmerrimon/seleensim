 2 I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE AND PURPOSE : 33 
Obesity is a growing epidemic, currently affecting over 1/3 of the adult US population1 and is a 34 
well-established risk factor for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.2 Given 35 
that the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are obese, weight loss is the cornerstone 36 
of treatment, and has been shown to decrease risk of long term complications3, lead to 37 
improvements in A1c and lipid levels4,5, as well as decreased need for medications and 38 
improvements in quality of life6. Unfortunately, lifestyle intervention is often ineffective at 39 
achieving long- term sustainable, clinically significant weight loss7. Bariatric surgery is a 40 
successful intervention, leading to 20 -30% weight loss with remission of diabetes in 30 -65% of 41 
patients 1 -5 years post surgery8,9. However, this invasive procedure is associated with high rates 42 
of short- and long- term complications, including need for reoperations, vitamin/mineral 43 
deficiencies, anemia, and osteoporosis10-12. It is clear that the cur rent management options for 44 
obese patients, including lifestyle changes, medications and surgery, are suboptimal and 45 
innovative strategies are necessary to optimize diabetes control and weight management.     46 
 47 
Energy balance and glycemic control are mediat ed largely by the gut -brain axis, specifically the 48 
vagus nerve. The vagus nerve can stimulate or inhibit food intake depending on nutritional 49 
status. Vagal nerve signaling is disrupted in the setting of obesity and thought to contribute to 50 
overeating behav iors13. Vagus nerve blockade has the potential to be a highly efficacious, 51 
minimally invasive intervention to address current obesit y treatment limitations. Clinical studies 52 
evaluating the efficacy of an implantable electric vagus nerve blockade device found that 53 
subjects lost on average 8.8% of total body weight at 1 year; patients with T2D experienced 54 
improved glycemic control, with an average A1c improvement of 1.0% at 12 months14. 55 
Unfortunately, nearly 40% of subjects experienced side effects related to the device15. A recent 56 
pilot study from our group at Emory University (see preliminary results) reported weight loss 57 
efficacy of a minimally invasive CT guided cryoablation of the vagus nerve in obese, non-58 
diabetic subjects. Patients lost 5.6% of total body weight and 22.7% excess body weight at 6 59 
months with no significant side effects16. We propose to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of 60 
this procedure through a randomized control trial in obese patients with T2D. We hypothesize 61 
that those patients undergoing the cryoablation procedure will experience improvement in 62 
glycemic control and enhanced weight loss at 6 months follow-up compared to the control group. 63 
 64 
Impact of weight loss on diabetes control and complications: Over 12% of adults in the 65 
United State s are affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D), the majority (>90%) of whom are 66 
overweight or obese. Weight loss, through lifestyle intervention, medications or bariatric 67 
surgery, is recommended for all overweight/obese individuals with T2D. Patients who are able  to 68 
achieve >5% weight loss at 12 months experience improvement in HbA1c, total cholesterol, 69 
LDL, HDL, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure7. Intensive 70 
lifestyle interventions, glycemic control and weight loss have also been shown to decrease the 71 
risk of development of chronic kidney disease17 and other microvascular diseases18. 72 
Unfortunately, many studies have shown that long- term maintenance of weight loss is 73 
tremendously difficult19,20. 74 
 75 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 3 Current weight management options: medication and bariatric surg ery: Weight loss 76 
medication and bariatric surgery are approved when adequate weight loss is not achieved with 77 
lifestyle interventions alone. Medications lead to clinically significant weight loss of >5% in 78 
approximately 50% of patients for whom they are prescribed, while the other half have 79 
suboptimal weight response21. Furthermore, weight loss effects are durable only while patients 80 
take the medications, with regain after cessation of drug therapy22. Bariatric surgery has proven 81 
superior efficacy over lifestyle interventions with regards to weight management, diabetes 82 
remission and reduction of comorbidities8,23. However, due to the invasive nature of surgery, 83 
concerns about long- term complications, and limited p atient access to accredited centers, 84 
bariatric surgery is underutilized. Up to 5% of patients experience a surgical complication 85 
following the procedure24, and rates of vitamin and mineral deficiency can reach >60%25. As 86 
such, options for long- term effective weight loss are limited and alternative strategies are needed 87 
to improve outcomes for obese patients. 88 
 89 
Gut-brain axis is an important regulator of diet induced obesity: In a lean, healthy milieu, 90 
intake of food triggers vagal nerve afferent neurons to relay information about gastric 91 
distension26 and satiety hormones to the hindbrain27, which responds appropriately to decrease 92 
food intake and stimulate t he hedonic reward system28. In the setting of chronic overeating and 93 
obesity, the release of satiety -inducing neuropeptides is decreased, while orexigenic signaling 94 
(hunger promoting) is preserved29, which may contribute to further hyperphagia. This data has 95 
been replicated in several animal models30-32 and provides a compelling argument that aberrant 96 
vagal nerve signaling promotes weight gain. Neuromodulation of the vagus nerve, therefore, is 97 
an attractive therapeutic intervention for obesity management.  98 
 99 
Historical utilization of vagotomy: The rationale behind the procedure is rooted in historical 100 
surgical treatments of duodenal ulcer disease, namely the evo lution of selective and highly 101 
selective surgical vagotomies33-35. Although these procedures have been largely supplanted by 102 
the medical management of Helicobacter Pylori, their safety and ancillary value for the 103 
management of obesity – and even subsequent heart disease and diabetes – have long been 104 
investigated .36-41 of particular relevance to this proposal is the development and study of an 105 
implanted vagal nerve stimulator f or purposes of managing obesity, the Vbloc® device. 106 
Investigators have shown that by modifying the afferent and efferent signaling pathways of the 107 
distal vagal fibers, significant positive effects are manifested via weight loss, anthropometric 108 
variables, cholesterol levels, blood glucose levels, quality of life, and blood pressure values .42 109 
Said another way, subdiaphragmatic vagotomies have a long history in humans without 110 
associated cardiac or sympathetic complicati ons. 111 
 112 
Vagus nerve blockade using an implantable device leads to weight loss and improvement in 113 
glycemic control and blood pressure:  A small, prospective, open label trial evaluated the 114 
efficacy of an implantable electric vagus blocking device (VBLOC) on gl ycemic control and 115 
blood pressure in obese subjects with T2D. Patients were implanted with VBLOC and followed 116 
prospectively for 12 months. Excess weight loss at 12 months was 25± 4%, with improvement in 117 
HbA1c from 7.8% ±0.2% at baseline to 6.8%. Decreases were also seen in fasting plasma 118 
glucose values and blood pressure14. Other studies using the same device for weight management 119 
have reported pain at the VBLOC site in nearly 40% of subjects 15 which may limit the 120 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 4 widespread applicability of this device despite promising efficacy data, and supports the notion 121 
of cryovagotomy as an alternative approach. 122 
 123 
Efficacy of CT guided cryoablation of the vagus nerve for weight loss:  Pilot data from 124 
investigators at Emory University has demonstrated the safety and feasibility of percutaneous CT 125 
guided cryoablation of the posterior vagal trunk in patients with mild to moderate obesity (BMI 126 
30-37 kg/m2). This small and uncontrolled study enrolled twenty subjects for a cryoablation of 127 
the vagus nerve along the distal esophagus. This rapid, minimally invasive procedure was found 128 
to be 100% technically successful. There were no procedure related complications or adverse 129 
events during a 6 month follow up period. In an extension of this protocol, patients were brought 130 
back after the 6 month study to be evaluated for gastroparesis. One subject was found to have 131 
delayed gastric emptying on imaging but was asymptomatic  clinically. It is unclear if this was 132 
related to the study procedure since baseline gastric emptying studies were not performed. 133 
Patients lost an average of 5.6% total body weight, with 22.7% excess BMI lost [delta BMI / 134 
(initial BMI -25)] over the 6-month monitoring period. Participant s reported decreases in appetite 135 
following the procedure at all time points, with 15.8% reporting “somewhat less appetite”, 136 
68.4% reporting “much less appetite”, and 10.5% reporting “very much less appetite.”16  137 
 138 
II. SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION:  139 
 140 
 Pilot data from investigators at Emory University has demonstrated the safety and feasibility of 141 
percutaneous CT guided cryoablation of the posterior vagal trunk in patients with mild to 142 
moderate obesity (BMI 30-40 kg/m2). This  small and uncontrolled study enrolled ten subjects 143 
for a cryoablation of the vagus nerve along the distal esophagus. This rapid, minimally invasive 144 
procedure was found to be 100% technically successful. There were no procedure related 145 
complications or adverse events during a 6 month follow up period. Patients lost an average of 146 
5.6% total body weight, with 22.7% excess BMI lost [delta BMI/(initial BMI -25)] over the 3 - 147 
month monitoring period. Participants reported decreases in appetite following the procedure at 148 
all time points, with 15.8% reporting “somewhat less appetite”, 68.4% reporting “much less 149 
appetite”, and 10.5% reporting “very much less appetite.”43  150 
 151 
In addition to weight loss, we anticipate that the cryovagotomy procedure will result in 152 
significant improvement in glycemic co ntrol and cardiovascular risk factors, which may result in 153 
long-term benefit is reducing diabetic complications. We propose a prospective, randomized 154 
controlled trial to determine if a minimally invasive cryoablation procedure of the vagus nerve 155 
will lead to greater weight loss and improvements in glycemic control, metabolic profile, and 156 
cardiovascular risk factors compared to lifestyle intervention in obese patients with T2D. Our 157 
data will provide preliminary data to support application for an NIH grant to further investigate 158 
manipulation of the gut-brain axis for management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. 159

plus lifestyle intervention at 6  and 12 months compared to lifestyle intervention alone in 164 
obese patients with T2D. Patients with T2D, BMI 30-40 kg/m2, A1c 7.5-10.5% on stable doses 165 
of oral antidiabetic agents will be randomized to cryoablation plus lifestyle or lifestyle 166 
intervention alone and will be followed prospectively for 12 months in a controlled randomized 167 
trial. We will compare changes in A1c levels  between groups at 3, 6 and 12-months of follow up.  168 
 169 
Objective 2. To determine changes in weight and anthropometric metrics among patients 170 
receiving cryoablation plus lifestyle intervention versus lifestyle intervention only. Changes 171 
in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and BIA measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months after 172 
intervention will be assessed.  173 
 174 
Objective 3. To determine safety of the cryoablation of the vagus nerve. We will monitor 175 
rates of AEs and SAEs related to the procedure which develop during the duration of the trial.  176 
 177 
B. ENDPOINTS:  178 
The primary endpoint  of the trial is difference in glycemic  control, defined as A1c, fasting 179 
glucose and insulin sensitivity (HOMA -IR), at 3, 6 and 12 months between the vagus nerve 180 
cryoablation group and the lifestyle intervention monotherapy group. 181 
  182 
The primary safety endpoint  of the trial is occurrence of death and all procedure related 183 
complications, such as bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary injury, 184 
complications of sedation, pain requiring hospital admission or treatment, dysphagia, 185 
gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting, and gastrointestinal ulceration for the duration of the study.  186

measures:  189 
1. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist -to-hip ratio at 3 and 6 months     190 
compared to baseline 191 
2. Lipids (total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides) at 6 months compared to baseline 192 
3. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline 193 
4. Daily caloric intake as measured by 3 -day food recall compared to baseline  at 3 and 6 194 
months. 195 
5. Changes in antihyperglycemic medication regimen compared to baseline  at 3 and 6 196 
months. 197 
6. Appetite, hunger and satiety scoring by visual analog scale at baseline, 1 w eek, 1 month, 198 
3 months and 6 months  199 
7. Physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) at baseline, 3 and 6 months  200 
8. Fasting glucose and insulin levels at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline  201 
 202 
 203 
C. STUDY DESIGN: 204 
This is a randomized, controlled, unblinded clinical study in obese adult patients with T2D, 205 
HbA1c 7.5-10.5%, BMI 30-40 kg/m2 treated with  non-insulin antidiab etic medications with 206 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 6 stable doses for at least 3 months. 207 
Subjects will be  pre-screened with  the relevant questions from the  Three  Factor Food 208 
Questionnaire by phone or in person to determine eligibility prior to consent . Following consent 209 
and screening fo r trial eligibility, subjects will be randomized to treatment group. The primary 210 
endpoint, glycemic control, will be assessed at 6 months post -procedure. Patients will be 211 
recruited from the diabetes clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital and Emory University Cl inics. 212 
 213 
We will be screen up to  40 participants to be able to randomized 30 patients, they will be 214 
enrolled in this pilot exploratory study. Patients will be randomly allocated to undergo either CT 215 
guided cryoablation of the vagus nerve plus lifestyle intervention or lifestyle intervention alone.   216 
Group 1:  CT guided cryoablation of the vagus nerve plus lifestyle intervention (n=15).   217 
Group 2: Lifestyle intervention by trained RD/CDE (n=15).  218 
All subjects will have the procedure performed at Grady Memorial  Hospital or Emory University 219 
Hospital Midtown or Johns Creek by trained study personnel.  220 
 221 
The study schema is shown below. Both groups will undergo screening for eligibility followed 222 
by randomization. If the subject is not fasting at time of initial cons ent and screening, he/she will 223 
be brought back for a subsequent visit with fasting blood work. Subjects must be randomized 224 
within 4 weeks of the screening visit. If the randomization visit falls outside of the 4 week time 225 
frame, the subject must undergo repeat screening procedures. In- person lifestyle counseling will 226 
be provided at baseline visit for both groups. Those undergoing cryoablation will receive a phone 227 
call 24 hour post -procedure to evaluate for any immediate complications, 1 week in person 228 
follow up visit, as well as  a safety call at 2 months. Subjects in both groups will have weekly 229 
contact with RD and in person follow up visits at 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Blood work, 230 
anthropometric data and questionnaires will be administered at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. 231 
Safety follow up appointments will be scheduled at 9 months and 12 months, though no further 232 
lifestyle counseling will be provided after 6 months. Questioning regarding adverse events and 233 
side effects will occur at all visits , as well as assessment of glycemic control. Anti- 234 
hyperglycemic medications will be adjusted at visits under the direction of the endocrinologist, 235 
or as needed for clinically significant hypo- or hyperglycemic events.  236

 D. STUDY PROCEDURE:  243 
Cryoablation procedure  (to be performed by Dr. Prologo or Dr. Dariushnia) : Subjects will 244 
be NPO for 12 hours prior to the ablation procedure. Metformin and sulfonylureas will be held 245 
the evening prior to the procedure. Subjects will present to the Interventional Radiology pre - 246 
procedure holding area at 8:00 AM on the morning of the procedure and will have a peripheral 247 
IV placed by nursing staff. Point of care blood glucose level will be checked; the procedure will 248 
be deferred for BG >250 mg/dl until diabetes control can be better optimized. Low doses of 249 
sedation will be used with IV versed and fentanyl. An Interventional Radiology nurse will 250 
monitor the subject while sedation is being administered. Skin will be numbed using lidocaine. 251 
The procedure will be done under CT guidance and involves a 4- 5 mm scalpel incision followed 252 
by percutaneous probe placement about the posterior gastroesophageal junction (the location of 253 
the posterior vagal trunk). The probe will create a zone of decreased temperature ( -20 to -40oC) 254 
involving the posterior vagal nerve fibers/plexus. The cryoablation process will include a 3- 255 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 8 minute freeze, followed by a 1- minute thaw, and a second 3-minute freeze  and 1 minute thaw . 256 
After the procedure, a sterile dressing will be applied, and subjects will be monitored for 12 257 
hours. 258 
 259 
Lifestyle Intervention: All subjects will receive standardized diet ary and exercise counseling 260 
from a registered dietitian and exercise physiologist (Dr. Frediani). Participants will be counseled 261 
to follow a low carbohydrate diet providing a moderate amount of carbohydrates per day (~100 262 
g). Focus will be on increasing fruits and vegetables and decreasing refined sugars and processed 263 
foods. Dietary counseling will include motivational interviewing, goal setting and nutrition 264 
education.44 Subjects will also be encouraged to slowly increase physical activity to at least 150 265 
minutes weekly. The lifestyle intervention structure will include detailed counseling sessions at 266 
baseline, 3 and 6 months. These sessions ideally will occur face- to-face, although telemedicine 267 
visit (via zoom) will  be permitted on case -by-case basis due to the COVID -19 pandemic. In 268 
addition, there will be weekly phone calls or texts (participants’ choice) providing a total of 26 269 
points of contact recommended by the USPSTF (United States Preventive Services Task 270 
Force).45  271 
 272 
Surveys: Subjects will complete a number of surveys  as part of participation in the trial.  at 273 
baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. Three-day food records are a validated method of 274 
assess food intake46 and will be administered at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 275 
months.S ubjects will also complete visual analogue scale ratings of appetite at baseline, 1 week, 276 
1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month.47 The International Physical Activity Questionnaires 277 
(IPAQ) is to provide a set of well -developed instruments that can be used internationally to 278 
obtain comparable estimates of physical activity .48 Subjects will also complete the relevant 279 
questions from the Three Factor Eating questionnaire during pre -screening and must have an 280 
average score ≥3 on questions 4, 8, 9, 13, and 14 to be eligible . The entire questionnaire will be 281 
administered after subjects have been consented. The Three Factor Eating Questionnaire is a 282 
self-assessment scale used in studies of eating behavior in overweight and normal individuals, 283 
designed to assess cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger.49 Preliminary investigation of 284 
this cryovagotomy procedure has identified subjects who score ≥3 on the aforementioned 285 
questions to be those who respond best to the intervention.16 286 
 287 
Blinding. The trial design is an unblinded, randomized control trial. By nature of the study 288 
design, participants and study personnel must be aware of which arm participants are enrolled. 289 
 290 
E. POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS:  291 
Risk to Human Subjects: Specific to this procedure, a 20 subject pilot was recently completed 292 
that demonstrated no procedure related complications or adverse events during 6 months of 293 
follow up. During the 12 month extension, 1/20 patients was found to have a prolonged gastric 294 
emptying time, though it is unclear if this was related to the study procedures as no baseline 295 
measurements were performed and th e subject was asymptomatic . The Visual –Ice Cryoablation 296 
System is intended for cryoablative tissue destruction using a minimally invasive procedure. As 297 
described in the Icesphere 1.5 Needle user manual on page 14, there are no known adverse 298 
events related to the specific use of the cryoablation needles50. The procedure is CT guided 299 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 9 which allows for real -time visualization of the process to ensure efficacy and avoid damage to 300 
any adjacent tissue or structures. Percutaneous  CT-guided cryoneurolysis is well established and 301 
routinely performed clinically. Specifically, Dr. Prologo’s group has conducted three other 302 
independent studies of peripheral nerve cryoablation, with procedural methods and outcom e 303 
measures that parallel  the methods described herein51-53. Perhaps more importantly though, 304 
the device is routinely used in clinical practice for the ablation of nerves as part of 305 
percutaneous procedures that are v ery similar to the percutaneous cryovagotomy proposed 306 
for this study, including cryoablation for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in the setting of 307 
cancer54,  celiac plexus cryoabl ation,55 as well as obturator nerve cryoablation, genitofemoral 308 
nerve cryoablation, cryoablation of medial branch nerves in the setting of facetogenic lumbar 309 
spine pain, and cryoablation of the inferior alveolar nerve.  310 
 311 
Regarding the mechanism of cryoneurolysis, the premise upon which nerve cryoablation 312 
procedures have been founded is the induction of a specific, reversible nerve injury.56-58 Nerve 313 
injury classifications are classically described and correlated with clinical course following 314 
trauma (crush, stretch, laceration, etc.), the most widely cited of which are the Seddon and 315 
Sunderland classifications.59,60  it has been shown that temperatures induced by cryoablation 316 
devices correspond with Sunderland 2 injuries in peripheral nerves.56,57 This precise neural injury 317 
results in several well described events that lead to favorable clinical outcomes – cessation of 318 
conduction, induced Wallerian degeneration, and predictable regeneration of axons upon an 319 
intact connective tissue scaffold. 57,58,61 the translation of these events (beyond conduction 320 
cessation) has been documented as nerve function recover y in animal studies and in humans62-65. 321 
62-66 322 
Please see below with more details on the identified potential risks of procedures performed 323 
percutaneously in interventional radiology: 324 
1.  Bleeding: The risk of bleeding is estimated to be <2%, and is specifically localized to 325 
the site of the skin incision (4- 5 mm). The risk of any internal bleeding is negligible since 326 
it is a CT guided procedure and direct visualization of the probe during the procedure 327 
limits any inadvertent involvement of vascular structures. After the procedure, patients 328 
will have a sterile bandage placed on the incision and will be monitored for 12 hours. 329 
2. Pneumothorax : Estimated risk is <1%. We feel that the risk of pneumothorax is non- 330 
significant given that this is a CT guided procedure, which will minimize any off target 331 
risk. Should any complications arise, this will be visualized in real time on the CT scan 332 
and immediate treatment will be provided.  333 
3. Sedation associated risks : <0.5% risk. Conscious sedation using fentanyl and versed 334 
will be used at standard procedural doses. Should any excess sedation occur, this will be 335 
reversed immediately in the procedural suite.  336 
4. Off target ablation : This refers t o any inadvertent ablation of other nerves, estimated to 337 
be <1.0% risk. This would be seen in real -time on CT guidance, and ablation could be 338 
halted immediately to prevent complete nerve resection.  339 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 10 Protection against risks: Our strict inclusion and exclusi on criteria for entry will help to 340 
minimize risks. In addition, we will carefully monitor patients with a phone call 24 hours, and 2 341 
months after the procedure, and a clinic visit at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months , 6 and 12 months. 342 
Subjects will be monitored fo r specific procedure related complications or adverse events  at each 343 
visit. Subjects will also be provided with contact information for study personnel should any 344 
events occur in between visits. Unscheduled events can be arranged to assess any urgent matte rs. 345 
All AEs, regardless of whether or not they are related to the procedure and use of the device, will 346 
be documented and reported to the IRB, DSMB, and FDA  in a timeline as specified by the  FDA 347 
Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, section 812.150 reporti ng (21CFR812.150(b)).Outcomes 348 
regarding hypo- and hyper- glycemia will also be collected and reported for safety monitoring. 349 
 350 
Subjects with poorly controlled diabetes ( A1c >10.5%) or a history of DKA will be excluded 351 
from enrollment. Subjects will be educated on the potential for development of hypoglycemia. 352 
Diabetic medications will be adjusted in event of hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia under the 353 
direction of Dr. Alexandra Migdal (Endocrinologist). Self -monitoring of blood glucose (BG) 354 
levels will be recommend ed twice daily and any time symptoms of hypo/hyperglycemia occur. 355 
In the setting of hyperglycemia (average BG >250 mg/dl x 1 week), medication doses will be 356 
adjusted. Subjects on metformin will have the dose titrated to a maximum of 2000 mg/d if 357 
tolerated. Sulfonylureas can be titrated to maximal doses per manufacturer instruction. Subjects 358 
may be prescribed rescue therapy with insulin in the event of significant hyperglycemia 359 
unresponsive to titration of oral agents.  In the setting of BG <100 mg/dl, sulfonylurea doses will 360 
be decreased by 50% and discontinued if necessary. If BG <55 mg/dl, sulfonylureas will be 361 
stopped. Metformin will be stopped if hypoglycemia persists. 362 
 363 
Technical success rate of the procedure and procedure related complications: 364 
Discontinuation of the trial will occur if 3 participants within the first 8 of 30 planned experience 365 
significant adverse events (AEs) (Grade 3 procedure -related AE or procedure -related serious 366 
AE) at any point during follow -up and if 4 participants experience significant AEs (Grade 3 367 
procedure- related serious AE) at any time. The trial will be stopped at any point if a Grade 4 or 368 
Grade 5 AE occurs until determination can be made regarding its potential relationship to study 369 
involvement.  370 
 371 
Grading of AEs: 372 
 373 
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL 
Grade 3 Severe or medically signif icant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
of prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL  
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5 Death related to AE67 
 374 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 11 Specific clinical signs or symptoms that will qualify for the above criterial include (amongst 375 
other potential Grade 3- 5 AEs not l isted here): constitutional symptoms (severe fatigue 376 
interfering with ADLs, fever > 40°C, prolonged and/or severe rigors), endocrine (uncontrolled 377 
hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis), gastrointestinal (inadequate caloric intake requiring TPN or IV 378 
fluids, diarrhea requiring IV fluids and/or manifesting as >7 stools/day, symptomatic abdominal 379 
distention or bloating, severe abdominal pain requiring narcotics, ileus, severe nausea requiring 380 
hospitalization, bowel obstruction or perforation), hemorrhage requiring intervention, infection 381 
requiring antibiotics, or pain interfering with ADLs.   382 
 383 
Withdrawal Criteria: The subject may withdraw at any time during the study by the primary 384 
care provider or his/her own decision. 385 
 386 
The subject may be withdrawn at the investigator’s discretion due to a safety concern or for 387 
contravention to the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. Any subjects experiencing a Grade 3-5 388 
AE as described will be withdrawn from the study. Reasons for study withdrawal will be tracked 389 
and documented. 390 
 391 
If a subject is withdrawn prior to completion of the 12 month study period, the subject will be 392 
encouraged to keep follow up appointments with the study team for monitoring of adverse events 393 
or until resolution of any adverse events related to the procedure.  394 
Data Safety Monitoring: In addition, an independent data safety monitoring committee 395 
(DSMC) will be established to serve as the primary data and safety monitoring group for the 396 
trial. The DSMC will review unblinded interim safety data, evaluate whether the  study should be 397 
stopped or amended for safety or other reasons, and make such recommendations to the 398 
investigators. In addition, the DSMC will provide input to the investigators concerning the study 399 
protocol, statistical analysis plan, administrative cond uct of the trial, and interpretation of the 400 
final safety and efficacy data. The DSMC will meet every 6 months, and as needed in the event 401 
of an unanticipated adverse device effect. At each meeting, the DSMC will review the incidence 402 
of adverse events, severity of each, statistical considerations, and safety concerns (including 403 
information on hypo- or hyper -glycemia) – as well as conduct of the trial and accrual goals.  404 
f. Potential benefits to the subject. We believe that subjects receiving the interventiona l 405 
treatment will benefit from modest weight loss and improvement in glycemic control. Subjects 406 
who receive the lifestyle counseling are expected to achieve modest weight loss as well. 407 
Furthermore, enrollment in clinical research studies and enhanced focus on glucose monitoring 408 
has been shown to reduce complications associated with hyperglycemia.   409

G. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  463 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 13 The primary outcome is the difference in glycemic control (as measured by HbA1c) at 6  and 12 464 
months between the vagus nerve cryoablation group and the lifestyle intervention group. 465 
Summary statistics including mean, median, and standard deviations for the changes in HbA1c   466 
at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months will be computed. We will then compare the changes at 6 months 467 
between the two treatment groups by a nonparametric Wilcoxon test or a two- sample t-tests 468 
(with appropriate data transformation if needed).  We will conduct one -way ANOVA to estimate 469 
the mean difference in glycemic parameters at 6  and 12 months  month between the two 470 
treatment groups. We may further adjust for some important confounders by using linear 471 
regression models. We will also assess the glycemic control outcomes simultaneously across 472 
different follow -up visits (i.e.  12, 24 weeks) through repe ated measures ANOVA models, which 473 
appropriately account for within- subject correlations in the measurements. In addition, we will 474 
consider repeated measures linear regression model with visits incorporated as a continuous time 475 
variable. We may include othe r covariates in the model when feasible.  476 
The primary safety endpoint  of the trial is the occurrence of death and all procedure related 477 
complications, such as bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary injury, 478 
complications of sedation, pain requiring hospital admission or treatment, dysphagia, 479 
gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting, and gastrointestinal ulceration for the duration of the study. 480 
We will first use the Chi- square test (or Fisher’s exact test) to compare the occurrence of this 481 
primary safety endpoint between the two treatment groups. We will perform logistic regression 482 
to evaluate the group difference while adjusting for other potential confounders such as age, 483 
gender, and BMI. In addition, we will compare the number of procedure rela ted complications 484 
by using Poisson regression or Negative Binomial regression between the two treatment groups. 485 
Standard model selection (e.g. forward, backward variable selection) and model checking 486 
procedures (e.g. deviance residual plot and Hosmer - Lemeshow test) will be performed to ensure 487 
the adequacy of the final models.  488 
 489 
Secondary outcomes will be compared between the two treatment groups. For continuous 490 
secondary outcomes, we will follow the plan proposed for primary outcome. For discrete 491 
secondary outcomes, we will first conduct cross -sectional comparisons based on Chi -squared 492 
tests or Fisher’s exact test.  If the discrete outcome is measured at multiple visits, we will fit 493 
repeated measures generalized linear models to simultaneously assess the difference in the 494 
longitudinal discrete outcome between the two treatment groups. Other covariates may be 495 
included in the models if feasible. 496 
 497 
Sample Size Calculation and Power Analysis:   498 
This study is generating pilot data for utilization of this procedure in a novel patient population. 499 
Given the 15 patients per group, taking into account 20% attrition rate, we would have 12 500 
patients per group. In this case, we would have 80% power to detect a difference in glycemic 501 
control outcome change that equals 1.2 times the standard deviation of the glycemic control 502 
outcome change. The data generated from this study will provide useful relevant preliminary 503 
data for planning larger randomized studies.  504 
 505 
 506 
IV. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING:  507 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 14 Data collection records with pers onal identifiers will be stored in locked file cabinets.  Blood 508 
samples drawn in conjunction with this study will not be labeled with information that could 509 
directly identify study subjects.  De-identified serum samples will be stored.  We may use the 510 
samples collected and stored in this study for future studies without a separate IRB consent for 511 
the subjects. This will be explained to the study subjects at the time of consent. If we use the 512 
samples in future studies, coded identifiers will be used. The inf ormed consent will make it clear 513 
that subjects can request their samples to be destroyed at any time. Presentation of the study 514 
results at regional or scientific meetings or in publications will not identify subjects.  Access to 515 
research and confidential r ecords will be limited to clinical investigators, research coordinators, 516 
and the IRB at Emory University.  517 
 518 
Study coordinators and/or investigators will collect baseline and follow up data, complete the 519 
CRF (case report form) and enter data into RedCap (el ectronic database provided by the Emory 520 
Research Information Technology Department). Baseline data will include demographics 521 
(gender, age, ethnicity), duration of diabetes, comorbid conditions, medications, BMI, screening 522 
labs, QOL assessment scores, appetite score, three- day food records analyzed using Nutrition 523 
Database System for Research (NDSR) and physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ).48 Follow up 524 
data will include medications, BMI, body measurements, follow -up labs, QOL assessment 525 
scores, appetite score, three-day food record, IPAQ, and adverse events.  526 
 527 
 528 
V. ETHICS:  529 
A. INFORMED CONSENT   530 
After identification of eligible patients these individuals will be provided basic information 531 
regarding the study and, if interested, a member of the research staff using inclusion/exclusion 532 
criteria delineated elsewhere in the protocol will then screen patients.  Informed consent will be 533 
obtained before any trial related procedures including screening procedures . The consent form, 534 
potential risks and benefits, and the rights of research participants will be explained to the 535 
participant by the investigators or research coordinator.  Individuals will be asked if they have 536 
questions, and a member of the research staff will answer questio ns.  The principal investigator 537 
(PI) will also be available at all times to answer questions that participants may have during the 538 
consent procedure or during the time a participant is enrolled in the study.  The consent form will 539 
be completed only by trained research personnel familiar with the study protocol procedures, 540 
informed consent process, who have undergone CITI training in accordance with the IRB 541 
guidelines of Emory University.  A signed copy of the consent form will be provided to the 542 
participant  and a copy will be placed in the file that is maintained for each participant in the 543 
study office. Adults who speak any of the following languages (English, Spanish) will be 544 
approached for participation in the study.    545 
 546  547 
B. RECRUITMENT AND RANDOMIZATION  548 
Subjects will be recruited from the Diabetes Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital and Emory 549 
Healthcare clinics . Patients with diabetes will be identified electronically.  Once a potential 550 
candidate is identified, we will approach the primary clinician  as well as t he patient for consent.  551 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 15  552 
Patients will be randomized consecutively using a computer -generated randomization table 553 
provided by Dr. Limin Peng at the Emory School of Public Health.  554 
 555 
 556 
VI. LIABILITY AND SUBJECT INSURANCE:  557 
A. FINANCIAL OBLIGATION  558 
No additional cost to patients or to the institution will be incurred for research purposes. Patients 559 
will not be billed for the laboratory work or any test that is being done only for study purposes.  560 
Patients will be responsible for the cost of their usual ongoing medical care, including 561 
procedures and/or non-study medications that their doctor requires as part of their usual medical 562 
care. 563 
 564 
B. PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION     565 
Participation in this study is voluntary.  Patients will receive $25 for the screening visit, $75 for 566 
the enrollment visit, $30 for the 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month and 12 month visit to 567 
compensate for time and effort.  Total compensation will be two hundred and fifty dollars 568 
($250.00).  569 
 570 
C. RESEARCH INJURIES   571 
If a patient is injured because of taking part in this study, Dr. Migdal and investigators at each 572 
institution, along with the medical facilities will make medical care available .  Emory University, 573 
however, has not set aside any money to pay participants or to pay for their medical treatment. 574 
The only exception is if it is proved that the injury or illness is directly caused by the negligence 575 
of an Emory /Grady employee.  “Negligence” is the failure to follow a standard duty of care. 576 
Financial compensation for such things as lost wages, disability or discomfort due to an injury 577 
related to the study is not available.   578

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209153
Protocol Title:  A Phase IIIb/IV Safety Trial of Nivolumab (BMS -936558) in Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Progressed During or After Recei ving At Least One Prior Systemic 
Regimen CheckMate 153: CHECK point pathway and nivolu MAb clinical Trial Evaluation 153
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):  Nivolumab solution for injection, 3mg/kg, intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes every 2weeks, 
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent (Cohort A) OR for 1year 
(52weeks) only, with possibility of retreatment on disease progression (Cohort B). 
Study Phase:  3b/4
Research Hypothesis: High grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-5) treatment -related select adverse events occur with a 
low frequency in subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with nivolumab monotherapy.
Objectives:  
Primary : To estimate the incidence of high grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) treatment related select 
adverse events in subjects with advance d or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed during or after at least one 
prior systemic therapy and are treated with nivolumab monotherapy . 
Secondary : To estimate the incidence and characterize the outcome of all high grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-4 and 
Grade 5 ) select adverse events in subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed during o r afte r 
at least one prior systemic therapy and are treated with nivolumab monotherapy.
Explo ratory : 
To assess safety and tolerability of nivolumab, as measured by incidence and severity of AEs and specific 
laborato ry abnormalities in all treated subjects, by tumor histology (SQ or NSQ), by subject subgroups, and in 
Cohort s A and B
To estimate efficacy of nivolumab by measuring OS, PFS, ORR based on investigato r assessment, and DOR in 
all treated subjects, by tumor histology  (SQ or NSQ), by subject subgroups, and in Cohort s A and B (OS, PFS 
and DOR only)
To explore the evolution of Patient Reported Outcome s (PRO) using the Lung Cancer Sy mptoms Scale (LCSS) 
and EQ -5D instruments in all treated subjects, by subject subgroups, and in Cohorts A and B.
To estimate the proportion of subjects exhibiting disease -related symptom improvement by 12 weeks as 
measured by LCSS
  
  

Study Design:  In this safety study  of nivolumab monotherapy, subjects will undergo screening evaluations to 
determine eligibility withi n 28 day s prior to first dose. Eligible subjects will be treated with nivolumab administered 
intravenously over 30minutes at 3 mg/kg every  two weeks. Each 14 day  dosing period will constitute a cycle. After 
1 year (52 weeks) of treatment all subjects who are still on treatment will be randomized (1:1) to one of the two 
cohorts, Cohort A or Cohort B. 
Cohort A: Subjects randomized to Cohort A will continue to receive treatment until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed conse nt. 
Cohort B: Subjects randomized to Cohort B will discontinue treatment at 1 year (52 weeks). After 
randomization, subjects will remain on the study and will follow all study assessments  
 Upon progressi on, subjects can receive retreatment. Ifsubjects are

 Subjects who are retreated can continue to receive 
study drug until further progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent. 
Study treatment can continue beyond initial investigator assessed progression, as specified in criteria presented in 
Section 4.3.4 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression.
The study will enroll subjects into 4 subgroups as detailed in Table 3.1-1.  Enrollmen t will open first to subgroup 1 
only. A decision to open enrollment for each of the other subgroups 2-4 will be dependent upon the sponsor review 
of data from the ongoing Phase 2 and 3 studies for each patient population. The decision will take into accoun t the 
overall risk/benefit profile for each patient population and the determination will be made whether or not to collect 
additional safety and efficacy data to supplement that already collected. 
At the time of Protocol Amendment 01 (June 2014), all sub groups were opened.
Protocol Amendment 03 (November 2014) allow edfor continued enrollment beyond 780 subjects in two of the 
study subgroups. However, as of Protocol Amendment 04 (December 2014), enrollment under Amendment 03 will 
stop, but enrollment will continue until 500 additio nal subjects aretreated . Enrollment will continue until a total of 
1280 subjects are treated.  
 
Under Protocol Amendment 04, all subjects will receive nivolumab by IVinfusion administered over 30 minutes, 
including new and existing subjects enrolled in the study andsubjects enrolled under Amendment 02.   
The study  will close after the last enrolled subject completes 5 year follow up. The duratio n of the study  will be 6.5 
years.
Study Population:  Patients with Stage 3b/4 NSCLC (squamous or non -squamous histology) w ho have experienced 
disease progression or recurrence during or after at least one systemic therapy  for advanced or metastatic disease. 
Subjects must meet all eligibility criteria specified in Section 3.3 of the protocol.
Study Assessments:  Main assessme nts include: Incidence, severity and outcome of select adverse events, and 
specific related laboratory abnormalities. Exploratory assessments include incidence and severity of all adverse 
events, laboratory abnormalities, efficacy measures, patient reporte d outcomes  
.
Statistical Considerations: 
Sample Size:  In order to further characterize the frequency and outcome of the rather infrequent treatment related 
select adverse of high grade (Grade 3-5), the current study will treat approximately 780 subjects with nivolumab. 
This sample size will allow for estimati ng an incidence rate of 0.5% (n=4 subjects with events) with a 95% CI 
(confidence interval) of (0.14%, 1.31%), or an incidence rate of 2% (n=16 subjects with events) with a 95% CI of 
(1.18%, 3.31%). 
This study also includes a randomization step reserved t o subjects who received nivolumab for 1 year (52 weeks). In 
MDX1106 -03, 27% of NSCLC subjects (10 of 37) were still on treatment [95% CI of (12.7%, 41.3%)] at Week 48. 
In the present study any subjects (all subgroups included) who are still benefiting from therapy after 52weeks 
(estimated to be between 99 and 322 subjects) will be randomized in order to continue treatment without any change 
in Co hort A, or to discontinue treatment in Cohort B, respectively.
Endpoints:   The primary objective of the study will be assessed by measuring the incidence for high grade 
(Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) treatment related select adverse events.
The select adverse events of interest are the following: pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, 
rash, endoc rinopathies, and hypersensitivity/infusion reaction events.
The secondary objective of the study will be assessed by measuring the following:
incidence for high grade (Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) select adverse events
median time to onset, median time to resolu tion (Grade 3 -4) of the select adverse events

subject s who received ≥ 40 mg prednisone equivalents, total duration of all immune modulating medications 
given for the select event.
Analyses:   
Primary  Analyses: The number and percentage of subjects who report high grade (Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) treatment 
related select adverse events will be summarized for all treate d subjects. High grade (Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) 
treatment related select adverse events will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria by system 
organ class and Medical Dictionary fo r Regulatory  Affairs (MedDRA) preferred term.
Secondary Analy ses: The number and percentage of subjects who report high grade (Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) select 
adverse events will be summarized for all treated subjects. High grade (Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) sele ct adverse events 
will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria by  system organ class and Medical Dictionary  for 
Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) preferred term.
Additional descriptive statistics will include median values using the Kaplan -Mei er (KM) product -limit method with 
95% CI using Brookmeyer and Crowley method of time to onset and time to resolution, and will be presented for all 
treated subjects, by  tumor histology  (SQ or NSQ), by  subject subgroups, and all randomized subjects for Coho rts A 
and B. Time to onset is calculated from first dosing date to the event onset date. If a subject never experienced the 
given AE, the subject will be censored at the last contact date. Time to resolution is calculated from the AE onset 
date to AE end date. If an AE is ongoing at the time of analysis, the time to resolution will be censored at the last 
contact date.
Management of high-grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) select adverse events will be characterized by 
measuring percentage of subjects who received immune modulating medicatio n (or ho rmonal replacement therapy ), 
percentage of subjects who received ≥ 40 mg prednisone equivalents, and total duratio n of all immune modulating 
medications given for the event, in all treated subjects who have e xperience high -grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 -4 and 
Grade 5) select adverse events, by  tumor histology  (SQ or NSQ), and also by  subject subgroups, and all randomized 
subjects in Cohorts A and B.

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer and cancer -related deaths globally, account ing for 
1.6millio n cases and 1.4millio n deaths worldwi de in 2008.1The majo rity of patients 
(approximately 78%) are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic disease. Prognosi s for these 
patients remains dismal, with 5-year survival rates of less than 5%. Approximately 85% of lung 
cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . Of these, approximately 80% are non squamous 
and 20% are squamous histology . 
Despite the increased number of treatm ent options available for patients with non-squamous 
(NSQ) NSCLC, there has been litt le overall survival (OS) improvement fro m several new agents ,
including pemetrexed and bevacizumab.2,3With the development of targeted agents for patients 
with tumors with driver mutations in the Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) or 
Anaplast ic Lympho ma Kinase (ALK) ,some improvem ent in progressi on free survival (PFS) is 
realized but as a consequence of acqui red resistance, the improvement in overall survival (OS) is 
still limited. Furthermore, patients with squamous cell NSCLC have generally not benefited fro m 
the development of new agents (eg, pemetr exed and bevacizumab). Consequently, NSCLC 
remains a disease with high burden and unmet medical need.
Immunotherapeutic approaches for the treatm ent of malignancy  recent ly have demonstrated 
clinical efficacy in several cancer types, including melanoma and horm one-refractory  prostate 
cancer.4Tumors may modulate and evade the host immune response through a number of 
mechanisms, including downregulation of tumor -specific antigen expressi on and presentati on, 
secretion of anti-inflammatory  cytokines, and upregu lation of inhibitory  ligands. Tcell 
checkpoint regul ators such as CTLA -4 and programmed death -1 (PD-1, CD279) are cell surface 
molecules that, when engaged by their cognate ligands, induce signaling cascades down -
regul ating Tcell activati on and prolifera tion. One proposed model by which therapeutic T cell 
checkpoint inhibitors derive ant itumor activit y is through breaking of immune tolerance to tumor 
cell ant igens.
BMS -936558 (nivo lumab) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype mAb that binds PD-1 on 
activa ted immune cells and disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD-L1 
(B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273), thereby purportedly  abrogating inhibitory  signals 
and augment ing the host anti tumor response. In early  clinical trials, nivolumab has demonstrated 
activit y in several  tumor types, including melanom a, renal cell cancer (RCC), and NSCLC.5
Nivo lumab clinical activity has been observed in heavily pretreated NSCLC subjects (n=129) in 
the Phase 1 multidose, dose escalation study  (MDX1106 -03). This study  showed object ive 
response rates (ORR) of 17% across a dose range of 1, 3 and 10mg/kg (6%, 32%, and 18% 
respectively ).6In the subjects who experienced an objective response, the median durati on of 
response was 17 months [95% CI: 9.7, NE).7
In general, nivolumab has been well tolerated to date, with a favorable safet y profile relative to 
anticipated toxi cities based on an immunostimulatory  mechanism  of action.5,6,7,8

1.1 Study Rationale
Nivo lumab, an ant i-PD-1 monoclonal antibody , has shown anti-tumor activit y in early  phase 
clinical trials across mult iple tum or types including NSCLC, renal cell carcino ma and melano ma. 
The registrati onal development path in NSCLC is in previously treated subjects with squamous 
(SQ) or non -squamous (NSQ) tumor histol ogy. In a l arge Phase 1 study , MDX1106- 03, a total  of 
129NSCLC subjects were treated with nivolumab, while the registrati onal NSCLC studi es 
include 500 subjects wi th similar disease characteristi cs. As the registrati onal activities progress, 
obtainin g additional specific safet y data will further inform the risk/benefit assessment for 
nivolumab. Using a single large study  is warranted in order to expand the safet y database and 
especially  to improve the preci sion of estimated incidence of uncommo n selec t high-grade 
adverse events (AEs). In addit ion, this study  could provide important insights into the potentia l 
contribution o f the underlying disease to the incidence and severit y of pulm onary  AEs in NSCLC 
subjects.
At the time of writing Versi on12 of theInvestigator Brochure (clinical data cut-off 
18March 2013), the overall safety experience with nivolumab, as monotherapy  or in 
combinat ion with other therapeuti cs, was based on data observed in approximately 1500 
subjects.9  In general, for monotherapy , the safety profile was similar across tumor types in 
completed and ongoing clinical trials with no MTD (maximum  tolerated dose) reached at any 
dose tested up to 10 mg/kg, and no pattern in the incidence, severit y, or causalit y of AEs to 
nivolumab at these dose levels. The one except ion is the incidence of pulmonary inflammat ion, 
which may be numerically greater in subjects wit h NSCLC possibly because in some cases it can 
be difficult to distinguish between nivolumab-related and unrelated causes of pulmonar y
symptoms and radiographic changes. For example, in study  MDX1106 -03, in a heavily pre-
treated NSCLC cohort (N=129), treatm ent-related CTCAE grade 3-4 pulmo nary toxicity 
incidence was 2%; however, in study  CA209-004 in advanced and metastatic melanoma subjects 
(N=33) there were no grade 3-4 pulmonary toxici tiesin a treatm ent arm with nivolumab 
following ipilimumab. At this time no other ri sk factor ,including prior radiotherapy , presence of 
lung m etastases or pulmo nary medical history ,has been ident ified.9
Nivo lumab-related AEs are mostly thought to be due to the effects of inflammatory  cells on 
specific tissues and management of these AEs may require special considerat ion. Among the 
safet y events observed, a few categories were ident ified as likely to be due to an immune 
mechanism. These select AEs may requi re more frequent monitoring and/or unique intervent ion 
(immunosuppressants or horm onal replacement), and are addressed in a consistent and unified 
manner throughout the program by specifically designed safet y algori thms (See Appendix 2 for 
Management Algorithms) . 
Categories of “select AEs” have been created to group together th e most commo n and impact ful 
preferred terms (PTs) by organ category, provi ding a better estimate of the frequency  of similar 
kinds of organ-related AEs instead of using PTs only. These select adverse events are further 
defined as fo llows:
may differ from o r be more severe than AEs caused by non -immunotherapies

may requi re unique (non-standard) intervention such as immunosuppressants (or horm one 
replacement therapy ), and
early  recogni tion and m anagement m ay mi tigate severe toxi city. 
The preferred terms included in the ‘select AEs’ category  are those that are expected to be most 
commo nly used to describe pneumo nitis, interstit ial nephrit is, di arrhea/colit is, hepat itis, rash, and 
endocrinopathies. Hypersensit ivity/infusio n reactions are al so consi dered a selec t AE category  to 
facilitate the pooling of the most relevant preferred terms for analyses of 
hypersensit ivity/infusio n reacti on events, and not because such events fit the criteria for select 
AEs listed above.
The frequencies of these events in study  MDX11 06-03 (Phase 1 study ; N =306; heavily  pre-
treated subjects with different tumor ty pes) are summarized in Table 1.1-1. The treatm ent-related 
select AEs of Grade 3-4 observed to date are rather uncommo n: 6% overall in study 
MDX1106 -03, while their incidence per category varies between 0.3% and 2% (pulm onary 
AEs). Of note, the 10 mg/kg cohort had numerically greater frequency of such AEs compared 
with the other dose levels. In the NSCLC subjects treated in the study (n=129) the overall 
incidence of Grade 3-4 treatm ent-related select AEs was 5%: 0% for skin and renal AEs, and 
endocrinopathies; 1% gastrointestinal, hepat ic,and infusi on react ion AEs;and 2% for pulmo nary 
events.7Most high-grade events of special interest were observed to have resolved while 
addressed with systemic corticosteroi ds and/or other immunosuppressive agents. One except ion 
was Grade 4 pneumonit is consi dered to have led to death of three subjects: two of them were 
treated at the 1mg/kg dose level and had NSCLC and CRC, respectively; the third subject had 
NSCLC and was treated at the 10mg/kg dose level.
Specific safet y algorithms have been designed for the select categories of AEs, and are 
implemented in a unified manner in all current studi es in the nivolumab program (See 
Appendix 2 for Management Algorithms) . These safet y algori thms assist the diagnosti c, the 
assessment of relatedness, and the management of the select AEs, also they are continuously 
evaluated and adjusted as experience accumulates. The current study will focus on improving 
preci sion around the frequency of high-grade select AEs, and on obtaining informat ion on their 
outcom e.

1.1.1 Rationale for Study D esign
The main object ive of the study  is to provi de additi onal insight into the frequency of high-grade 
select AEs and their outcom e, and thus suppl ement the growing safet y database of nivolumab -
treated subjects. This study  will treat approximately 780 subjects in order to estimate the 
incidence of the rare high grade (CTCAE V4 Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) treatment -related select 
AEs with greater precisio n and characterize their outcom e (between 0 and 2% incidence per 
event ty pe in NSCLC subjects treated with nivo lumab monotherapy  in previous studies). 
The safet y assessment for the patient subgroups 1-3 is expected to be similar and hence the size 
of those individual cohorts will not be fixed. There i s the possibili ty that the saf ety assessment of 
subgroup 4 (PS2) could be different and so enrollment is limited t o 100 subjects.
Also, the large number of subjects enrolled will allow an opportuni ty to describe, as an 
exploratory  objective, two different treatm ent durati ons in terms of safety, efficacy , and patient -
reported outcom es (PRO) data. In study MDX1106- 03, after 48weeks of treatment with 
nivolumab at the 3mg/kg dose level, 27% of the NSCLC subjects were still on treatm ent (95% 
CI: 12.7%, 41.3%). Following on that observat ion, in the current study , subjects who are still 
benefit ing from the drug after completing 1year of treatm ent will be rando mized 1:1 in two 
cohorts. Subjects randomized to CohortA will continue on treatment until progressi on, 
unacceptable toxicity, or wi thdrawal of inform ed consent. Subjects randomized to CohortB will 
remain on study  butwill discont inue treatm ent. Upon disease progressi on, subjects in Cohort B 
will be allowed to resum e treatm ent. Subjects randomized to Cohort Bwho restart treatm entwill 
then continue on treatm ent untilprogressi on, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal  of inform ed 
consent .
An additional 500 subjects will be treated under Protocol  Amendment 04 (December 2014) to 
continue collect ing safet y informat ion and to characteri ze the outcom e of immune -mediated si de 
effects. Theseadditional data will provi dealarge r data set to inform the risk/benefit profile of 
the use of nivolumab in lung cancer patients andwillhelp tofurther clarify the effect iveness of 
the current treatm ent algorithms for managing drug-mediated toxicities(See Appendix 2 for 
Management Algor ithms) .
1.1.2 Rationale for Subject Subgroups
Obtaining additional data on the incidence and outcom e of high grade (Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) 
select events in a similar patient population as that included in the nivolumab registrati onal 
NSCLC studies is warranted t o further support the assessment of risk/benefit. 
Obtaining similar data in patient populati ons that have been previously excluded from the 
registrati onal studies (ie. subjects with PS2) will provi de critical information for the nivolumab 
clinical devel opment program, and also for medical onco logists when making treatm ent 
decisio ns. Treatment with nivolumab insubjects with PS2 is planned to allow for signal 
detection for both safet y and efficacy as an exploratory  object ive (subgroup 4). This data will 
inform  if further investigation of the risk/benefit profile of nivolumab in this subject subset is 
justified.

1.1.2.1 Rationale for Exploring Fixed Treatment Duration vs Continuous 
Treatment on Maintaining Tumor Response
In the current Phase 2/3 trials subjects are continuously treated with nivolumab on a schedule of 
3mg/kg IV every  2weeks until disease progression orunacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of 
inform ed consent. Safet y and efficacy profile of nivolumab monotherapy  in a schedule with 
defined treatm ent duration and retreatm ent upon disease progressi on has not been previously 
assessed. There is evidence for other cancer immunotherapi es that administration of treatm ent 
for a fixed period of time can translate into prolonged benefit, eg, ipilimumab or 
aldesleukin.10,11,12,13,14,15In subjects with NSCLC treated in MDX1106 -03, 50% of  the observed 
responses occurred rapidly and were demonstrated at first tumor assessment (at 8weeks). The 
most delayed response was observed shortly after 30weeks.16After 1year of treatment, 27% of 
NSCLC subjects (10 of 37 total; 5 of 18 for SQ and 5 of 19 for NSQ) treated at 3mg/kg dose 
level were still on treatm ent. Moreover, most of them (9 of 10) continued to experience durable 
responses. For those patients that do progress after treatment discont inuat ion, will be allowed to 
receive retreatm ent until progressi on, unacceptable toxicity,or withdrawal of informed consent. 
Response to retreatment with immunotherapies such as ipilimumab has been shown.17Hence, 
the intention to obtain informat ion on the effect of different treatm ent durations on maintaining 
the tumor response is warranted, as it may inform on the value of further testing of alternat ive 
schedules. 
1.1.3 Rationale for Nivolumab Monotherapy
PD-1 is a 55 kD type I transmembrane protein primarily expressed on activated T cells, B cells, 
myelo id cells, and antigen present ing cells (APC) .18Binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and PD-L2 has 
been shown to down -regul ate T-cell activation in both murine and human systems.19,20,21,22In 
particular, PD-L1 has been shown to be upregul ated on several cancers types including NSCLC 
and, in some cases, correlated to negative prognosis.23,24,25,26 ,27PD-1/PD -L interacti ons may 
also indirect ly modulate the response to tum or antigens through T-cell/APC interact ions. 
Therefore, PD-1 engagement may represent one means by which tumors evade 
immunosurveillance and clearance.28Blockade of the PD-1 pathway by nivolumab has been 
studi ed in a variet y of preclinical in vit ro assays, and anti tumor acti vity using a murine anal og of 
nivolumab has been shown in a number of immunocompetent mouse cancer models. Based on 
these and other preclinical data, PD-1 blockade by nivolumab has been pursued as a promising 
therapeuti c strategy  to reverse immune tolerance and enhance T-cell effector function in several 
tumor types including NSCLC.9
Substant ial mo notherapy  clinical activity has been observed in second line NSCLC subjects 
treated in the ongoing Phase 1 study  ofnivolumab (MDX1106 -03, Section 1.4.3 .3). This study 
showed object ive response rates (ORR, 19-26% for 3 and 10mg/kg nivolumab) greater than the 
histori cal ORR for docetaxel (approximately 8-10%) .29,30,31Medi an durati on of response for 
NSCLC subjects in MDX1106 -03 was more than 6months, as compared to a median PFS for 
docetaxel and pemetrexed of approximately 3months.29,30,31Furthermore, the adverse event

profile for nivolumab appears favorable versus docetaxel or pemetrexed, as hematol ogic 
toxicities are currently rare and the majorit y of non-hematol ogic toxicities are low grade and 
manageable.
1.1.4 Rationale for Nivolumab Dose and Schedule
The dose and schedule of nivolumab in this study will be 3mg/kg every  2weeks, based upon a 
24February 2012 analysis of safety, efficacy, and exposure -response data from the ongo ing 
Phase 1 study , MDX1106 -03. Anti-tumor activit y was observed in NSCLC subjects at dose 
levels o f 1, 3and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Ant i-tumor activi ty appeared to approach a pl ateau at 
dose levels of 3mg/kg and above. Consistent with these observat ions,the resul ts of exposure -
response analyses showed that the probabilit y of a tumor response tended to approach a plateau 
for trough concentrations produced by  3mg/kg and 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks.
Nivo lumab was adequately tolerated up to 10mg/k g, the highest dose level tested, and no 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was ident ified. While the spectrum , frequency , and severi ty of 
nivolumab -related AEs were generally similar across the dose levels tested, the 10mg/kg dose 
level had numerically  higher rates of Grade 3/4 drug-related SAEs and AEs leading to 
discontinuat ion. Based on these observat ions, a dose of 3mg/kg every  2weeks was chosen for 
further studi es. Further informat ion on observed safety, efficacy and pharmacokinet ic data from 
MDX1106 -03is reviewed in Sect ion1.4.3.1 .
1.1.5 Rationale for Initial Tumor Assessment after 8Weeks of Treatment
Accumulat ing clinical evidence indicates some subjects treated with immune system  stimulat ing 
agents may devel op progression of disease (by convent ional response criteria) before 
demonstrating clinical object ive responses and/or stable di sease. This phenom enon was observed 
in the Phase 1 MDX1106 -03 study  of nivo lumab. Two hy potheses have been put forth to expl ain 
this phenom enon. Fi rst, enhanced inflammat ion within tum ors coul d lead to an increase in tumor 
size appearing as enlarged index lesio ns and as newly visible small non -index lesio ns. Over time, 
both the malignan t and inflammatory porti ons of the mass may then decrease leading to overt 
signs of clinical improvement. Another hypothesis is that the kinet ics of tumor growth may 
initially outpace anti-tumor immune activit y in some individuals. With sufficient time, the anti-
tumor ac tivity will dominate and beco me clinically apparent. For these reasons, the initial tumor 
assessment in MDX1106 -03 was conducted at 8 weeks
To mitigate the risk of detecting false-progressi on early in the course of treatment with 
nivolumab, the initial tumor assessment in this study  will take place after 8 weeks of treatm ent 
(5days). Subsequent tumor assessments will take place regul arly every 8weeks (5 days) 
through 24 months of treatm ent, disease progressio n, lost to follow-up or withdrawal of study 
consent.  After 24 months of treatment, tumor assessments will take place regul arly every  12 
weeks (5 days) until the end of treatment or until disease progressi on, lost to follow-up or 
withdrawal  of study  consent.

1.1.6 Rationale for Tumor Tiss ue Collection
Aberrant expressio n of PD-L1 protein by tumor cells (retrospectively  detected by IHC) has been 
reported in a number of human malignancies, especi ally in rel ation to poor prognosis in multiple 
tumor types, including squamous cell and non-squamous NSCLC.23,24,25,26, 32 , 33 , 34These 
findings may be explained by the notion that high PD-L1 expressi on leads to immune evasi on. 
This hypothesis is supported by separate studies demonstrating that PD-L1 expressed by tumor 
cells enhances apoptosis of activated tumor-specific T cells in vit ro and that the expressio n of 
PD-L1 protects tumor cells from the induct ion of apoptosis by effector T cells.35In NSCLC, 
blocking PD-L1 allows for the increase of tumor -infiltrating CD8+ T cells and an increased 
producti on of IFN-γ but no difference noted in peripheral  blood CD8+ T cells when subjects 
with NSCLC were compared with healthy control s.36These high levels of PD-L1 protein 
expressio n in NSCLC have also been significant ly associ ated with poor prognosis and the 
presence of tumor infiltration by  immature dendrit ic cells.26
Intriguingly , preliminary  data indicate that PD-L1 protei n expressio n in tumors may correl ate 
with nivolumab clinical activity. Archival tumor specimens from a limited subset (N = 30) of 
subjects in MDX1106 -03 were assessed for tumor PD-L1 protein expressio n measured by 
immunohistochemistry  (IHC). In this subset, 100% of subjects whose tumors lacked detect able 
expressio n of PD-L1 protein (N = 13) did not have evidence of clinical benefit (response, stable 
disease, or mixed response) to nivolumab, whereas subjects whose tum ors were deemed PD-L1-
positive (based on PD-L1 protein expressio n on a pre-defined threshold of tumor cells) were 
more likely to demonstrate clinical benefit. Despite the limited number of subjects evaluated in 
this initial study , our findings indicate that tumor PD-L1 protein expressi on status may have a 
profound impact on the likelihood o f a pati ent to respond to nivol umab therapy . Because clinical 
benefit appeared to correlate with PD-L1 status measured in baseline, pre-treatment specimens, 
these data also suggest that PD-L1 expressio n could serve as a predict ive biomarker for patient 
selection. As such, analysis of a larger number of samples is warranted, and evaluation of 
additional patients (and thei r tum ors) enrolled in the MDX1106- 03 study  is ongoing. 
In this trial, baseline tumor tissue will be collected for biomarker analyses.  
 
 
 
 
 
1.1.7 Rationale for Shortened Infusion Time
The risk/benefit profile for nivolumab has primarily been investigated using a 60 minute 
infusio n.  Long infusio n times place a burden on pati ents and treatm ent centers. Establishing that 
nivolumab can be safely  administered using shorter infusio n times will diminish some of this

burden. Amendment 04will assess the risk/benefit of a shorter infusio n time of 30minutes 
durati on for nivo lumab in lung canc er pati ents.
Previous clinical studi es of nivolumab monotherapy  have used 60 minute infusion durati on for
nivolumab. Nivo lumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses ranging up to 10 
mg/kg over long treatm ent durati on. InCA209010, (Phase 2, randomized, doubl e blind, dose-
ranging study  of nivolumab insubjects with advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC) a dose 
associ ation was observed for infusio nsite reactions and hypersensit ity reacti ons (1.7% at 0.3 
mg/kg, 3.7% at 2  m g/kg and 18.5% at10 mg/kg). All the events were grade 1-2 and were 
manageable. Overall, infusio n reacti ons including high-grade hypersensit ivity react ions have 
been unco mmo n across nivolumab clinical studi es,and all have been managed by following the 
safet y algori thms (See Appe ndix 2 for Management Algorithms) .Infusio n durati on of30 
minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provi ded at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to
present any safety concerns compared with th e prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose 
infused over a 60 m inute duration.
1.2 Research Hypothesis 
High-grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-5) treatm ent-related select adverse events occur with a low

select adverse events in subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed

To estimate the incidence and characteri ze the outcome of all high grade (CTCAE v4.0 
Grade 3-4 and Grade 5) select adverse events in subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
who have progressed during or after at least one prior systemic therapy and are treated with

1.4 Product Development Background
Nivo lumab is in clinical devel opment for the treatm ent of subjects with NSCLC, renal cell 
carcino ma (RCC) and melanoma. The registrati onal devel opment path in NSCLC is in 
previously treated subjects with squamous (SQ) or non -squamous (NSQ) tumor histology .  
1.4.1 Mechanism of Action of Nivolumab
Cancer immunotherapy  rests on the premise that tum ors can be recognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effect ively attacked by an activated immune system . An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely  on immune surveillance of tum or anti gens expressed on 
cancer cells that ult imately results in an adapt ive immune response and cancer cell de ath.
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisit ion of traits that allow cancer cells to 
evade immunosurveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive immune responses.37,38,39
Support for the role of immunosurveillance in NSCLC is suggested in retrospective analyses 
demonstrating a correl ation between tumor infiltrating lymphocy tes in surgically resected 
specimens and recurrence free survival.40,41,42Current immunotherapy  efforts attempt to break 
the apparent tolerance of the immune system  to tumor cells and antigens by either introducing 
cancer antigens by therapeuti c vaccinat ion or by modulat ing regul atory  checkpo ints of the 
immune system.
T-cell stimulat ion is a com plex process involving the integrati on of  numerous posi tive as well as 
negat ive co-stimulatory  signals in addition to anti gen recogni tion by the T -cell receptor (TCR).43
Collect ively, these signals govern the balance between T-cell activation and tolerance. PD-1 is a 
member of the CD28 family of T-cell co-stimulatory  receptors that also includes CD28, 
CTLA -4, ICOS, and BTLA29. PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD28 -mediated 
upregul ation of IL-2, IL-10, IL-13, interferon -γ (IFN -γ) and Bcl-xL. PD-1 expressio n also been 
noted to inhibit T cell activation, and expansi on of  previously activated cells. Evidence for a 
negat ive regulatory  role of PD-1 comes from studi es of PD-1 deficient mice, which devel op a 
variet y of autoimmune phenoty pes 40. These resul ts suggest that PD -1 blockade has the potenti al 
to activate anti-self T-cell respon ses, but these responses are variable and dependent upon 
various host genet ic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibit ion is not accompanied by a 
universal loss of tolerance to self ant igens. 
In vitro, nivolumab binds to PD-1 with high affini ty (EC50 0.39-2.62 nM), and inhibit s the 
binding of PD -1 to i ts ligands PD -L1 and PD -L2 (IC50 ~1 nM). Nivolumab binds specifically to

PD-1 and not to rel ated members of the CD28 family such as CD28, ICOS, CTLA -4 and BTLA. 
Blockade of the PD-1 pathway  by nivolumab results in a reproducible enhancement of both 
proliferat ion and IFN-γ release in the mixed lymphocy te reaction (MLR). Using a CMV -re-
stimulat ion assay wi th human PBMC, the effect of nivol umab on anti gen specific recall  response 
indicates that nivolumab augm ented IFN-γ secretio n from CMV specific memory  T  cells in a 
dose-dependent manner versus isoty pe-matched control . In vivo blockade of PD-1 by a murine 
analog of nivolumab enhances the anti-tumor immune response and resul t in tumor reject ion in 
several immunoc ompetent m ouse tum or models (MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02).9
1.4.2 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) - Background and Treatments
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer -related deaths globally . An estimated 221,130 new 
cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in 2011.44The majorit y of subjects (approximately 78%) 
are diagnosed with advanced or metastati c disease. Progression after first-line therapy  occurred 
in nearly all o f these subjects and the 5 y ear survival  rate i s only  3.6% in the refractory  setting.44
There is a particular unmet need among patients who have squamous cell NSCLC (represent ing 
up to 25% of all NSCLC) as there are few treatm ent options after first-line therapy  (ie, 
pemetrexed is not a treatm ent option.2,45In addit ion, there are targeted therapeuti cs that are 
restri cted to the non -squamous popul ation due to adverse events (i e, bevacizumab was associated 
withfatal hemorrhage sin squam ous cell subjects).46According to NCCN guidelines, the use of 
single agent chemotherapy is standard -of-care for pati ents with recurrent and metastatic NSCLC 
after failure of platinum -based therapy .44Histori cal median PFS rates in second -line NSCLC are 
approximately  2.6 -3.2 months, and median OS rates approximately  6.7 to 8.3 m onths (l onger in 
the recent ZODIAC trial, 10+ months).30,31, 45, 47 , 48Current therapy  in second -line includes 
docetaxel, erlotinib and pemetrexed (only  in non-squamous histol ogies).30,31,45No agent has 
shown superi ority in OS when compared to docetaxel. Different docetaxel schedules (other than 
the standard q3 weeks), chemotherapy doublets using docetaxel , and other comparat ive agents 
have not shown improvement over docetaxel in this line of therapy .49,50,51,52, 53
1.4.3 Nivolumab Clinical Results
Two studi es contributed to most of the monotherapy  clinical experience with nivolumab in 
subjects with malignancies. CA209001 was a Phase 1 single -dose dose escalat ion study  in 
subjects (N = 39) with previ ously  treated advanced or metastati c cancer. Subjects received a 
single dose of nivolumab at 0.3, 1, 3, or 10mg/kg with an option for retreatment at 3 months. 
MDX1106 -03 is an ongoing Phase1 open -label, multiple dose escalat ion study  in subjects with 
select previously treated advanced solid tumors, including melanoma, RCC, NSCLC (squamous 
and non -squamous), colorectal cancer, and hormone- refractory  prostate cancer. Subjects received 
nivolumab at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg intravenously every  2 weeks, up to a maximu m 
of 2 years of total therapy. As of 18March 2013 data cut-off date, 129 subjects with NSCLC 
were treated. Most active doses, as m easured by  ORR, were 3 and 10 mg/kg. An ORR of 19% to 
26% was reported with a 24-week progressi on free survival rate (PFSR) of 25% to 45%. Only a 
single response (1/33) was reported at 1mg/kg. Durable responses were observed in both

squamous and non-squamous subtypes. ORR at 3mg/kg and 10mg/kg in squamous was 22% 
and 24%, and in nonsquamous was 26% and 19%, respectively .9
1.4.3.1 Clinical Pharmacology Summary
Single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was evaluated in subjects with multiple tumor 
types in CA209001, whereas mult iple dose PK is being evaluated in s ubjects in MDX1106 -03. In 
addition, a preliminary populati on pharmacokinet ic (PPK) model has been developed with data 
from approximately 350 subjects from CA209001, CA209002, and MDX1106-03.
Single dose PK of nivolumab was evaluated in 39 subjects with multiple tumor types in study 
CA209001 in the dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. The median Tmax across single doses ranged 
from 1.6 to 3hours with individual values ranging from 0.9 to 7hours. The PK of nivolumab is 
linear in the range of 0.3 to 10mg/kg with dose-proporti onal increase in Cmax and AUC(INF) 
with low to m oderate inter -subject variabilit y observed at each dose l evel (i e, CV ranging from 7 
to 45%). Geometric mean clearance (CL) after a single intravenous (IV) dose ranged from 0.13 
to 0.19 mL/h/kg, while mean vo lume o f distribut ion (Vz) varied between 83 to 113 mL/kg across 
doses. The mean terminal T-HALF of nivolumab is 17 to 25days, which is consistent with half 
life of endogenous IgG4, indicat ing that the elimination mechanism of nivolumab may b e similar 
to IgG4. Both eliminat ion and distribut ion of nivolumab appear to be independent of dose in the 
dose range studied. Addit ional details are provided in the Invest igator Brochure.9
A preliminary  PPK model was devel oped by nonlinear mixed effect modeling using data from 
350subjects from CA209001, CA209002 and MDX1106- 03. Clearance (CL) of nivolumab is 
independent of dose in the dose range (0.1 to 10 mg/kg) and tumor types studied. The body 
weight norm alized dosing produces approximately constant trough concentrations over a wide 
range of body  weights, and hence is appropriate for future clinical trials of nivo lumab.
1.4.3.2 Safety Su mmary
The overall safet y experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy  or in combinat ion with other 
therapeuti cs, is based on experience in approximately  1500 subjects treated to date. For 
monotherapy , the safet y profile is similar across tumor types. The one except ion is pulmo nary 
inflammat ion AEs which may be numerically  greater in subjects with NSCLC. In some cases it 
can be difficult to distinguish between nivolumab -related and unrelated causes of pulmonar y 
symptoms and radiographic changes. There was no pattern in the incidence, severit y, or causali ty 
of AEs to nivo lumab dose level.9
In MDX1106 -03, at the data cut-off date of 18March 2013, a total of 306 subjects were treated 
and 303 (99.0%) subjects have at least 1 reported AE regardless of causali ty. The most 
frequently reported AEs were fatigue (54.9%), decreased appeti te (35.0%), diarrhea (34.3%), 
nausea (30.1%), and cough (29.4 %). Treatment -related AEs were reported in 230 (75.2%) of the 
306 subjects. The most frequent ly reported treatment -related AEs were fatigue (28.1%), rash 
(14.7%), diarrhea (13.4%), and pruri tus (10.5%). Most treatment -related AEs were low grade. 
Treatment -related high grade (Grade 3 -4) AEs were reported in 52 (17.0%) of subjects. The most 
frequently reported treatm ent-related high grade AE was fatigue (6.5%). The 10mg/kg cohort

had numerically greater frequency of high-grade select AEs (events with a  p otential 
inflammatory  mechanism requi ring more frequent mo nitoring and/or uni que intervent ion such as 
immunosuppressants and/or endocrine replacement therapy ). 
Addit ional details on the safet y profile of nivolumab, including resul ts from other clinical 
studi es, are also available in the IB.9
1.4.3.3 Anti-Tumor Activity Summary
Efficacy data from MDX1106 -03 updated on 18- Mar-2013 are presented inthe Invest igators’ 
Brochure.9All subjects initiated study  treatm ent at least 14months before analysis. Clinical 
antitumor activ ity was observed in heavily pretreated melanoma, RCC, and NSCLC subjects at 
all nivo lumab doses tested. NSCLC subjects (n=129) were treated at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg. 
Antitumor activit y was mainly observed in the 3 and 10 mg/kg dose groups, and exposu re-
response appeared to be relat ively flat at doses 3 mg/kg. At the 3 and 10 mg/kg dose l evels, the 
RECIST -defined objective response rates for NSCLC subjects were 24% and 20%, respectively, 
with no notabl e differences between squamo us and non-squamous histol ogies. Amo ng 
responders with NSCLC, the median durati on of response was 74 weeks (range 6+ to 134 
weeks). PFS rates at 24 weeks (PFSR -24) ranged from 25% to 45% at the 3 and 10 mg/kg dose 
levels. These preliminary  data suggest that nivol umab induces s ubstant ial durable di sease control 
in heavily  pretreated subjects with NSCLC.
Nivo lumab monotherapy  at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks is also being evaluated in one of several 
cohorts of chemotherapy- naive patients with advanced NSCLC in study  CA209012. After at 
least 2 months of follow-up, preliminary resul ts (data base lock 15-Apr-2013) from this cohort 
(n=20), including 9 squamous subjects and 11 non- squamous subjects, show an ORR of 30% 
(22% in squamous; 36% in non -squamous).9
These response rates in patients with heavily pretreated NSCLC in MDX1106 -03 and in 
chemotherapy -naive NSCLC patients from the CA209012 study  are comparable to th e response 
rate with platinum -doublet chemotherapy. The durati on of responses in the MDX1106 -03 study 
compares favorably to chem otherapy  and suggests that continued study  of nivolumab in NSCLC 
subjects is warrented.9
1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who progress with first-line therapy  represent a 
great unmet need. The clinical activity of nivolumab observed to date in NSCLC suggests the 
potenti al for improved clinical outcom es as monotherapy . Nivo lumab) also has the potenti al for 
clinically relevant adverse events including liver toxicities, thyroiditis, pneum onitis, and 
diarrhea. However, the activi ty and manageable AEs profile observed wi th nivo lumab supports a 
larger safet y study  in Stage III/IV NSCLC patient popul ation that has progressed during or af ter 
receiving at least one prior sy stemic regimen.

14day dosing period will const itute a cycle. After 1year (52weeks) of treatm ent all subjects 
who are still on treatm ent will be rando mized (1:1) to one of the two cohorts, Cohort A or 
Cohort B.
Cohort A: Subjects randomized to Cohort Awill continue to receive treatmentuntil disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicit y, or wi thdrawal  of inform ed consent. 
Cohort B: Subjects randomized toCohort Bwilldiscontinue treatment at 1year (52weeks) . 
After rando mizat ion, subjects will remain on the study  and will follow all study  assessments 
. Upon progression, subjects can 
receive retreatm ent.
Subjects who are retreated can continue to receive study  drug until further progressi on, 
unacceptable toxicit y, or withdrawal of informed consent. 
Study treatm ent can continue beyond initial investigator assessed progressi on, as specified in 
criteria presented in Secti on 4.3.4 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression .The study  will close 
afterthe last enrolled subject completes 5 y ear follow up.
The study  will enroll subjects into 4 subgroups as detailed in Table 3.1 -1.
Enrollment will open first to subgroup 1 only. A decision to open enrollment for each of the 
other subgroups 2- 4 will bedependent upon the sponsor review of data from the ongoing Phase2 
and3studi es for each patient population. The decisio n will take into account the overall 
risk/benefit profile for each pat ient popul ation and the determinati on will be made whether or not 
to collect addit ional safet y and efficacy data to supplement that already co llected. 
At the time of Protocol Amendment 01 (June 2014), all subgroups were opened.
Protocol  Amendment 03 (November 2014) allowed for continued enrollment beyo nd 780 
subjects in two of the study  subgroups. However, as of Protocol Amendment 04 (December 
2014), enrollment under Amendment 03 will stop, but enrollment will continue until 500 
additional subjects are treated. Enrollment will continue unt il a tota l of 1280 subjects are treated.  
 
Under Protocol  Amendment 04, all subjects will receive nivolumab by IV infusio n administered 
over 30 minutes, including new and exist ing subjects enrolled in the study , including subjects 
enrolled under Amendment 02.

3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
A Women of childbearing potenti al (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experi enced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilizat ion (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy ) and is not postm enopausal . Menopause is defined as 12 m onths of  amenorrhea in 
a wom an over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physio logical causes. In 
addition, wom en under the age of 55 years must have a serum  follicle stimulating horm one, 
(FSH) level > 40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.*
*Wo men treated with horm one replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washou t period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum  FSH level is >40 mIU/ml  at any time 
during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal:
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral  products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as lo ng as 6 months.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
The following medicat ions are prohibited during the study  (unless utilized to treat a drug related 
adverse event):
Immunosuppressive agents (except to treat a drug -related adverse event)
Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroi ds (except as stated in Section 3.4.3 )
Any concurrent ant ineoplast ic therapy (ie, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy , immunotherapy , 
extensive, non -palliat ive radiati on therapy , or s tandard or invest igational agents for treatm ent 
of NSCLC).

Any botani cal preparati on (eg ,herbal supplements or traditional Chinese medicines) intended 
to treat the disease under study  or provi de supporti ve care.   
Prior radiotherapy  must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to starting study  treatment 
per inc lusion criteria 2g. See Sec tion 3.4.3 for guidance on concomitant palliat ive radiotherapy.
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Subjects wi th active, known or suspected autoimmune disease are e xcluded. Subjects wi th typeI 
diabetes mellitus, hypothy roidism  only requiring horm one replacement, skin disorders (such as 
vitiligo, psori asis, or alopeci a) not requiring systemic treatm ent, or conditions not expected to 
recur in the absence of an externa l trigger are permitted to enroll.
Subjects wi th a condi tion requi ring systemic treatment wi th either corti costeroi ds (> 10mg daily 
prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14days of starting 
treatm ent are excluded. Inhaled ortopical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 
mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of act ive autoimmune disease.
3.4.3 Permitted Therapy
Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalat ional 
corticosteroi ds (with minimal systemic absorpti on). Adrenal replacement steroi d doses > 10 mg 
daily  predniso ne are permitted. A brief (less than 3weeks) course of corticosteroi ds for 
prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune condi tions (eg, 
delayed -type hypersensi tivity react ion caused by a contact allergen) is permitted. 
Concomitant palliat ive and supportive care for disease related symptom s (including 
bisphosphonates and RANK -L inhibitors) is allowed if initiated prior to first dose of study 
therapy .
The potenti al for overlapping toxi cities wi th radiotherapy and nivolumab current ly is not known. 
Therefore, palliat ive radiotherapy is not recommended while receiving nivolumab. If palliat ive 
radiotherapy  is requi red, then nivolumab shoul d be withheld for at least 1 week before, during, 
and 1 week after radiat ion. Subjects should be closely mo nitored for any  potenti al toxi city during 
and after receiving radiotherapy , and AEs shoul d resolve to Grade 1 prior to resuming 
nivolumab. Only non-target bone lesions that do not include lung tissue in the planned radiati on 
field may receive palliat ive radiotherapy . Details of palliat ive radiotherapy  should be 
docum ented in the source records and electroni c case report form (eCRF). Details in the source 
records should include: dates of treatment, anatomical site, dose administered and fractionation 
schedule, and adverse events. Subjects receiving limited field palliat ive radiation therapy  will be 
considered to have unequivocal progressi on of disease in the non-target lesion. Symptom s 
requi ring palliat ive radiotherapy  should be evaluated for objective evidence of disease 
progression. Administration of additional nivolumab to subjects who received limited field 
palliat ive radiation shoul d follow guidelines specified in Secti on 4.3.4 , Treatment beyond 
Disease Progressi on.

3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment
Subjects MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator) for any o f the following reasons:
Subject’s request to stop study  treatm ent  
Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory  abnormalit y or intercurrent illness which, in 
the opinio n of the invest igator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study  is not in 
the best interest of the subject
Pregnancy
Terminat ion of the study  by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS)
Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily 
incarcerat ion for treatm ent of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious disease) 
illness
After rando mizat ion in Cohort B, until disease progressio n when subjects are eligible for 
retreatm ent  
Other protocol specific reas ons for discont inuat ion as specified in Sect ion 4.3.5 .
All subjects who discont inue invest igational product shoul d comply with protocol  specified 
follow-up proced ures as outlined in Secti on5. Subjects in Cohort B continue with the on-study 
visit schedule ( Table 5.1 -2) until  disease progression foll owing retreatm ent or upon a deci sion to 
not receive retreatm ent, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal  of informed consent. The only 
exception to this requirement is when a subject withdraws consent for all study  procedures 
including post-treatment study  follow-up or loses the abilit y to consent freely (ie,is imprisoned 
or invo luntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or phy sical illness ).
If study  treatm ent is discont inued prior to the subject’s completion of the study , the reason for 
the discont inuat ion must be documented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Post Treatment Study Follow up
Subjects who discontinue study  treatment will continue to be followed. The subjects will be 
followed up for select AEs beyond 100 days from the last dose of study therapy, for ongoing 
drug-related AEs unt il resolved, return to bas eline or deem ed irreversible, or until lost to f ollow-
up or wi thdrawal  of study  consent. 
One of the exploratory  end points is overall survival  and every  attempt will be made to obtain 
survival status every  3months until death, lost to follow -up, or wi thdrawal  of study  consent.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discont inue study  treatment will remain in the study  and must continue 
to be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to thi s is when a 
subject specifically  withdraws consent for any  further contact wi th him/her or persons previ ously 
authori zed by subject to provide this informat ion. Subjects shoul d notify the investigator of the

withdrawal  of consent shoul d be explained in detail  in the medical records by  the invest igator, as 
to whether the withdrawal  is from further treatment with study  drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatm ent study  follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In 
the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly 
available informat ion shoul d be used to determine vital status only as appropri ately  directed in 
accordance with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow-up with persons authori zed by the subject as noted above. Lost to 
follow-up is defined by the inabilit y to reach thesubject after a minimum of three docum ented 
phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. 
All attem pts shoul d be docum ented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the 
subject has di ed, the si te will  use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If invest igator’s use of third-party  representative to assist in the follow-up portion of the study 
has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the invest igator may use a Sponsor -
retained thi rd-party representative to assi st site staff wi th obtaining subject’s contact inform ation 
or other public vital status data necessary  to com plete the follow -up porti on of  the study .The site 
staff and representative will consul t publicly available sources, such as public healt h registries 
and databases, in order to obtain updated contact informat ion.If after all attem pts, the subject  
remains l ost to f ollow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by the invest igator should 
be reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.

current Invest igator brochure for BMS -936558 (nivo lumab).9
4.2 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
After the subject’s eligibilit y is established and informed consent has been obtained, the subject  
will be enrolled and a number will be assigned through an interactive voice response system 
(IVRS). Also, the IVRS will be used to manage staggered enrollment of subject subgroups, and 
to randomize subjects at 1 year (52 weeks, 2weeks) as well as to track the rando mized subjects 
from subgroups to cohorts. Specific instructi ons and procedures for using IVRS will  be provi ded 
to the invest igational site in a separate document/ manual.
The investigator (or designee) will register the subject for enrollment by following the 
enrollment procedures established by BMS. The following informat ion is requi red for 
enrollment:
Date of informed consent
Date of birth
Gender at birth
Diagnosis (i e,SQ or NSQ NSCLC)
Number of lines of therapy  with confirmed progression 
PS
The subjects who com plete 1 y ear (52 weeks) of study  treatm ent and are still  benefi ting from the 
nivolumab treatm ent will be rando mized (1:1) via IVRS to on e of the two cohorts, Cohort A or 
Cohort B. 
4.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Subjects will receive treatm ent with nivolumab as a 30 minute IV infusion, on Day 1 of a 
treatm ent cycle every  2weeks. Dosing calculati ons shoul d be based on the body  weight assessed 
as per Table 5.1 -2. The dose shoul d remain the same if the subject’s weight is wi thin 10% of  the 
baseline weight. All doses shoul d be rounded to the nearest milligram. There will be no dose 
escalat ions or reductions of nivolumab allowed. Subjects may be dosed no less than 12days 
from the previous dose. There are no premedicatio ns recommended for nivolumab on the first

cycle. If an acute infusio n reacti on is noted, subjects should be managed according to Sectio n
4.3.6 .
Subjects will be monitored continuously  for AEs while on study . Treatment modificat ions (eg, 
dose delayor discont inuat ion) will be based on specific laboratory  and adverse event criteria.
Early recogni tion and management may mitigate severe toxicity. Evaluat ion and Management  
Guidelines were developed to assist invest igators and can be found in the Invest igator Brochure:
Suspected Pulmo nary Toxici ty
Diarrhea and Colit is
Suspected Hepatotoxicit y (including asymptom atic liver function tests [LFT] elevat ions)
Suspected Endocrinopathy
Nephrotoxi city
For subjects expected to require more than 4 weeks of corticosteroi ds or other 
immunosuppressants to manage the adverse event, consider recommendat ions provided in 
Secti ons 4.3.1 to Secti on 4.3.3 .
4.3.1 Dose Delay Criteria
Tumor assessments for all subjects shoul d continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed.
4.3.1.1 Nivolumab Dose Delay Criteria
Nivo lumab administration should be delayed for the fo llowing:
Grade 2 non -skin, drug- related AE, with the exception of fat igue
Grade 2 drug -related creatinine, AST, A LT and/or t otal bilirubin abnormalit ies
Grade 3 skin, drug- related AE
Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalit y, with the following except ions: 
Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomat ic amylase or lipase does not require dose delay
Grade 3 AST, ALT, total bilirubin will require dose discontinuation 
Any adverse event, laboratory  abnormalit y, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the invest igator, warrants delaying the dose of study medicat ion.
Subject s who require delay of nivolumab shoul d be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently if 
clinically indicated and resume nivo lumab dosing when re -treatm ent cri teria are m et.
4.3.2 Dose Reductions
There will be no dose modificat ions of nivo lumab.
4.3.3 Criteria to Resume Treatment with Nivolumab
Subjects may resume treatm ent with nivolumab when the drug-related AE(s) resolve(s) to 
Grade 1 or baseline, with the following exceptions: Subjects may resume treatm ent in the 
presence of Grade 2 fat igue.
Subject s who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume treatm ent in 
the presence o f Grade 2 skin toxicit y.

Subjects with baseline AST/ALT or total  bilirubin in the Grade 1 toxicit y range who require 
dose delays for reasons other than a 2-grade shift in AST/ALT or total  bilirubin may resume 
treatm ent in the presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT OR total bilirubin 
For subjects with Grade 2 AST, ALT and/or total bilirubin Abnormalit ies, dosing may 
resum e when laboratory  values return to baseline and management with corticosteroi ds, if 
needed, is complete.
Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT AND total bilirubin values meeting 
discontinuat ion parameters should have treatment permanent ly discont inued
Drug -related pulmo nary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatm ent is resumed. Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately  controlled with only 
physio logic horm one replacement m ay resume treatm ent
If treatm ent is delayed > 6weeks, the subject must be perm anent ly discont inued from study 
therapy ,except as specified in Sect ion 4.3.5 .
Subjects in Cohort B will also be allo wed to resume treatment upon progression
Subject s with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physi ologic 
horm one replacement may resume treatm ent after consultat ion with the BMS Medi cal Monitor 
(or designee). Adrenal insufficiency requi res discont inuat ion regardl ess of control  with hormone 
replacement.
4.3.4 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
As described in Secti on 1.4.3.3 ,accumulat ing evidence indicates a minorit y of subjects treated 
with immunotherapy  may derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of PD. Subjects treated 
with nivolumab will be permitted to continue treatm ent beyo nd initial RECIST 1.1 defined 
progressive disease (PD) as long as the fo llowing cri teriaare m et:
1)Invest igator -assessed clinical benefit and do not have rapid disease progression
2)Tolerance of study  drug
3)Stabl e performance status
4)Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progressi on (eg, CNS m etastases)
5)Subject provi des wri tten informed consent pri or to receiving addi tional nivolumab treatm ent, 
using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomf orts, or other alternative 
treatm ent opti ons.
The decisi on to continue treatm ent bey ond initial progression shoul d be discussed wi th the BMS 
medical Monitor and documented in the study  records.
A radiographic assessment/ scan should be performed within 8weeks of original PD to 
determine whether there has been a decrease in the tum or size, or continued PD. The assessment 
of clinical benefit shoul d be balanced by clinical judgm ent as to whether the subject is clinically 
deteri orating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued treatment with nivo lumab.

If the invest igator feels that the nivolumab subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by 
continuing treatment, the subject shoul d remain on the trial and cont inue to receive monitoring 
according to the Time and Events Schedule on Table 5.1-2.
For the subjects who continue nivolumab study  therapy beyo nd progressi on, further progressio n 
is defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial PD.This 
includes an increase in the sum of all target lesions and/ or the development of new measurable 
lesions. Treatment shoul d be discont inued permanent ly upon docum entati on of further disease 
progression
New lesions are considered measureable at the time of initial progressi on if the longest diameter 
is at least 10mm (except for pathol ogical lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15mm). Any new lesion considered non-measureable at the time of initial progressi on may 
beco me measureable and therefore included in the tum or burden volume if the longest diameter 
increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of 
at least 15 mm).
Subjects withglobal deterioration of health status who requir e discont inuation of treatment  
without obj ective evidence of disease progressi on at th etime of treatm ent discont inuat ion should 
be reported as ‘symptomat ic deteri oration’. Every effort should be made to document objective 
progression (ie radiographic confirmat ion)even after discont inuat ion of treatment.
4.3.5 Treatment Discontinuation Criteria
Tumor assessments for all subjects shoul d continue as per protocol even if dosing is 
discontinued.
Nivo lumab treatment should be permanent ly discont inued for the fo llowing:
Any Grade 2 drug-related uveit is, eye pain or blurred visio n that does not respond to 
topical therapy  and does not improve to Grade 1 severit y within the retreatm ent period

Any dosing interruption last ing > 6weeks with the fo llowing except ions:
Dosing interrupti ons to manage drug-related adverse events, such as prolonged 
steroi d tapers, are allowed. Prior to re-initiating treatm ent in a subject with a dosing 
interrupti on lasting > 6weeks, the Sponsor Medic al Moni tor designee must be 
consulted. Tumor assessments shoul d continue as per protocol  even if dosing is 
interrupted.
Dosing interrupti ons > 6weeks that occur for non-drug-related reasons may be 
allowed if approved by the Sponsor Medi cal Monitor designee. Prior to re-initiating 
treatm ent in a subject with a dosing interrupti on lasting > 6weeks, the Sponsor 
Medical Moni tor desi gnee must be consulted. Tumor assessments shoul d continue as

Any adverse event, laboratory  abnorm ality, or i ntercurrent illness which, in the judgment 
of the Invest igator, presents a substant ial clinical  risk to the subject with continued 
nivolumab dosing
4.3.6 Treatment of Nivolumab -Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely to be 
immunogenic and induce infusio n or hy persensi tivity react ions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruri tus, arthralgias, 
hypo tension, hypertensio n, bronchospasm, or other allergic -like react ions. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusio n react ions shoul d be reported within 24 hours to the study  medical  monitor and reported 
as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusio n react ions shoul d be graded according to NCI CTCAE 
(Versi on 4.0) gui delines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms: (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention 
not indicated).

Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic prem edicati ons are recommended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000mg at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms: (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic 
medications indicated for 24hours).
Stop the nivo lumab infusio n, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/o r acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subj ect until  resol ution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d 
and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusio n is 
interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further complicati ons ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 
100% of the original infusio n rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptom s recur, then no 
further nivo lumab will be a dministered at that visit .
For future infusio ns, the following prophylacti c prem edicat ions are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg 
shoul d be administered at least 30 minutes before nivolumab infusio ns. If necessary , 
corticosteroi ds (up to 25 m g of SoluCortef or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4  s ymptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical 
sequelae [eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]. Grade 4: Life-threatening; pressor 
or ventilatory support indicated).
Immediately discont inue infusio n ofnivolumab. Begin an IV infusio n of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows: Reco mmend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV admi nistrati on, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylpredniso lone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject shoul d be monitored until 
the Investigator is comfortable that the symptom s will not recur. Nivo lumab will be 
perm anent ly discont inued. Invest igators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatm ent of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery of the 
symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersensit ivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a l ocalized or generalized 
pruri tus within 1 week after treatm ent), symptomat ic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).

5.3.4 Imaging Assessment for the Study
Any incidental findings of potenti al clinical relevance that are not direct ly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol  should be evaluated and handled by the Study  Investigator as per 
standard m edical/clinical judgment.
5.4 Efficacy Assessments
5.4.1 Screening (Baseline visit) and On -Study Efficacy Assessments
Study  evaluati ons will take place in accordance with Table 5.1-1andTable 5.1-2, according to 
RECIST 1.1 criteria.54High resolution CT with oral/intravenous contrast or contrast-enhanced 
MRI is the preferred imaging modalities for assessing radiographic tumor response. If a subject  
has a known allergy  to contrast material, please use local prophylaxis standards to obtain the 
assessme nt with contrast if at all possible, or use the alternate modality. In cases where contrast 
is strictly contraindicated, a non-contrast scan will suffice. Screening assessments shoul d be 
perform ed wi thin 28 days of start of study  treatment. Brain MRI is th e preferred imaging method 
for evaluat ing CNS metastasis, and assessment is required during screening in subjects with a 
known history  of treated brain metastases. All known or suspected sites of disease (including 
CNS) should be assessed at screening and at subsequent assessments using the same imaging 
method and technique. If more than one method is used at screening, then the most accurate 
method according to RECIST 1.1 should be used when recording data, and shoul d again be used 
for all subsequent asses sments. Bone scan, PET scan, or ultrasound are not adequate for 
assessment of RECIST response. In selected circum stances where such modalities are the sole 
modality used to assess certain non-target organs, those non-target organs may be evaluated less 
frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is 
ident ified in target disease or when progressi on in bone is suspected. Previously  treated CNS 
metastases are not considered measurable lesions for purposes of RECIST determined response. 
Subjects with a history  of brain metastasis should have surveillance MRI approximately every 
12weeks, or sooner if clinically indicated.   After 24 months of treatment, the frequency  of 
surveillance brain MRI procedures will be every  6 months or earlier, if clinically  indicated for 
patients wi th brain metastases.
Radiographic tumor assessments will be conducted at Week 9 (5 days) and every 8weeks 
(5days) thereafter through 24 months of treatm ent, disease progressi on (or until 
discontinuat ion of study therapy in patients receiving nivolumab beyo nd progressi on), lost to

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational 
(medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational produc t.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and shoul d be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The casual relat ionship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administr ation and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal  relationship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneo usly reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypotheti cally migh t have caused death if it 
were m ore severe)
requi res inpat ient hospitalizat ion or causes prolongati on of existing hospi talizat ion (see 
NOTE below)
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcom es listed in the defini tion above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limit ed to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency 
room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasi as or convulsio ns that do not 
resul t in hospi talizat ion.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)

Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory  definit ion, these events must be handled as SAEs. (See 
Secti on6.1.1 for reporting pregn ancies).
NOTE : 
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency room  or other hospital departm ent < 24 hours, that does not 
resul t in admissi on (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routi ne healt h assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routi ne col onoscopy )
medical/surgi cal admissi on other than to rem edy ill healt h and pl anned pri or to entry  into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , caregiver respi te, family  circumstances, administrative reason).
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAE s, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated with 
protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 100days of discont inuat ion of dosing. If applicable, SAEs must be collected that 
relate to any  later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ). 
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed 
to be rel ated to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be co mpleted for any  event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
the condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal  of previous therapy  or a c omplicat ion of a study 
procedure ), the relat ionship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not rel ated to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to B MS (or 
designee) within 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electroni c or paper forms). When using paper forms, the reports 
are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) trans missio n to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number:  Refer to Con tact Informat ion list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electroni c submissi on is the 
requi red method for reporting. The p aper forms shoul d be used and submi tted immediately , only

in the event the electronic system  is unavailable for transmissio n. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting): Refer to Contact 
Inform ation list.
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Foll ow-up 
SAE reports should include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported .) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new informat ion 
beco mes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) u sing the same procedure used for transmitting the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs should be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilizat ion.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collect ion of nonseri ous AE informati on should begin at ini tiation of study  drug. Nonseri ous 
AE informat ion shoul d also be collected from the start of a  placebo lead-in period or other 
observat ional period intended to establish a baseline status for th e subjects. 
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or discont inuat ion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonseri ous AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Com pletion of supplemental  CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalit ies 
that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laborator y test resul t abnorm alities shoul d be captured on the nonseri ous AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE 
Any laboratory  test result abnorm ality that required the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Any laboratory  test resul t abnorm ality that requi red the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term would be used by 
the reporting invest igator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequent ly discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant atthe time of study exposure, including during at

least 5 half lives after product administration, the investigator must immediately notify the BMS 
(or desi gnee) Medical  Monitor of  this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form  to BMS (ordesignee) within 24 hours and in accordance with the SAE reporting 
procedures described in Sect ion 6.1.1 .
In most cases, the study  drug will be perm anent ly discont inued in an appropri ate manner (eg, 
dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study  drug is thought to outwei gh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study  drug, after a thorough 
discussio n of benefits and risk wit h the subject.
Protocol  required procedures for study discont inuation and follow-up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy
follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.
Follow-up informat ion regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal  and neonatal 
outcom e and where applicable, offspring informat ion must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance form
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental  or intentio nal administrati on of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a  p otenti al DILI event. All occurrences of potenti al DILIs, 
meet ing the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Sect ion6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1.AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) 
AND
2.Total  bilirubin > 2 times ULN, wi thout ini tial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase)
AND
3.No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevat ion and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, vi ral hepatitis, pre-exist ing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration o f other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical  examinat ions, 
electrocardi ogram , x-ray filming, any other potential safet y assessment required or not required 
by protoco l shoul d also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported 
accordingly.

7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE AND OTHER EXTE RNAL 
COMMITTEES
The sponsor of this study  will not utilize an independent data safet y monitoring board (DSMB). 
BMS will assign a physician responsible for reviewing, on a systemat ic and continuous basis, the 
safet y of subjects on this study . This includes a review of serious and non -serious adverse events, 
and all hematol ogical  and non-hematol ogical events. Inaddition, BMS has a Medical 
Surveillance Team  (MST), independent from the clinical medical monitor. The MST has the 
primary  responsibilit y within Bristol -Myers Squibb for assessing emerging safet y trends, 
ident ifying potenti al safety signals, notifying appropri ate stakeho lders of relevant findings, and 
implement ing risk mitigation activit ies to ensure the safet y of patients participating in BMS 
trials. The MST is also responsible for reviewing data from all sources including non-clinical 
studi es and clinic al trials, monitoring the progress of various nivolumab (BMS -936558) safet y 
support activit ies, and reco mmending and implement ing necessary changes to the safet y plan and 
any other specific safet y-related acti vities.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
In general, for nivolumab monotherapy , the safety profile to date is similar across tumor types, 
while select treatm ent related adverse events of high grade (Grade 3-4) are rather uncommo n. 
Their overall incidence was 6% in a previous Phase 1trial that tested nivolumab at doses 
between 0.1mg/kg to 10mg/kg in 306subjects with different recurrent or refractory 
malignancies (MDX- 03). The incidence observed for similar AEs 0% in NSCLC subjects 
(n=129) was 0% for skin and renal  AEs, and endocri nopathi es; 1% gastro- intestinal, hepat ic and 
infusio n reaction AEs, and 2% for pulmo nary events.7
In order to further characterize the frequency and outcom e of such apparent ly infrequent safet y 
events, the current study will treat with nivolumab approximately  780subjects who have

8.1.1 Sample Size at Randomization
This study  also includes a randomizat ion step reserved to subjects who received nivolumab for 
1year. In MDX1106 -03, 27% of NSCLC subjects (10 of 37) were still free from disease 
progression at 48 w eeks [95% CI of (12.7%, 41.3%)]. In the present study  any subjects (all 
subgroups included) who are still benefit ing from therapy  after 1year (estimated to be between 
99 and 322 subjects) will be rando mized in order to continue treatm ent without any chang e in 
Cohort A (until progressi on, toxicity or withdrawal  of consent), or to discont inue treatm ent in 
Cohort B, respectively. In the latter subjects will have the option of retreatm ent shoul d 
progression occur.
8.2 Populations for Analyses
All enrolled subjects : all subjects who signed an informed consent form and were 
registered into the IVRS. 
All treated subjects: all subjects who received any nivolumab. This is the primar y

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary object ive of the study  will be assessed by measuring the incidence for high grade 
(Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) treatment related select adverse events. 
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The secondary  objective of the study  will be assessed by measuring the fo llowing:
incidence for high grade (Grade 3 -4 and Grade 5) select adverse events
median time to onset, median time to resolution (Grade 3-4)
percentage of subjects who received immune modulating medicat ion (e.g. cortico idsteroi ds, 
inflixi mab, cyclophophamide, IVIG, and mycopheno late mofetil), or hormonal replacement 
therapy , the percentage of subjects who received ≥ 40 mg prednisone equivalents, total 
durati on of  all immune m odulating medications given for the select event.
8.3.3 Exploratory En dpoint(s) 
Safety and tolerabili ty will be measured by the incidence of all adverse events, serious adverse 
events, deaths and laboratory  abnorm alities. Adverse event assessments and laboratory  tests will 
be performed at baseline, and continuously througho ut the study  at the beginning of each 
subsequent cy cle. 
Efficacy data will be assessed by measuring OS, DOR, ORR and PFS. These endpo ints are 
defined as fo llows:
OS is defined as the time from first dosing date to th e date of death. A subject who has not 
died will be censored at last known date alive. OS will be followed continuously  while 
subjects are on the treatm ent and every  3 months via in-person or phone contact after 
subjects discont inue the study drug. 
DOR is defined as the time from first confirm ed response (CR or PR) to the date of the init ial 
objectively docum ented tum or progressi on as determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death 
due to any  cause, whichever occurs fi rst. For subjects who nei ther progress nor di e, the DOR 
will be censored on thedate of their last evaluable tumor assessment. DOR will only be 
evaluated in subjects with objective response of CR or PR.
Object ive response rate (ORR) is defined as the number and percentage of subjects with a 
best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).

Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designat ion, recorded between 
the date of first dose and the date of the ini tial objectively  documented tum or progressi on per 
RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy , whichever occurs first. For subjects without 
docum ented progression or subsequent therapy , all available response designat ions will 
contribute to the BOR determinat ion.
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the ti me from first dosing date to the date of the 
first documented tumor progression, as determined by invest igators (per RECIST v1.1), or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who die without a reported prior 
progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who 
did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. 
Subjects who did not have any on study  tumor assessments and did not die will be censored 
on the first dosing dat e.
PRO data will  be assessed by measuring change from baseline of the EQ -5D and LCSS scores at 
each assessment point, and disease -related symptom  improvement rate at week 12 measured by 
LCSS.
 
8.4 Analyses

Kaplan -Meier (KM) product -limit method with 95% CI using Brookm eyer and Crowl ey method 
of time to on set and time to resol ution, and rate of discont inuation due to event occurrence will 
be presented for all treated subjects, by  tumor hi stology (SQ or NSQ), by  subject s ubgroups, and 
all rando mized subjects for Cohort s A and B. Time to onset is calculated from first dosing date to 
the event onset date. If a subject never experi enced the given AE, the subject will be censored at 
the last contact date. Time to resol ution iscalculated from the AE onset date to AE end date. If 
an AE is ongoing at the time of analysis, the time to resolut ion will be censored at the last 
contact date.
8.4.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
OS and PFS will be summarized by KM product -limit method for all treated subjects and all 
response evaluable subjects, respectively. Median values of OS and PFS, along with two-sided 
95% CI using Brookm eyer and Crowley  method, will be calculated. Survival rates at 6, 12, 18 
and 24 months will also be estimated using KM estimates on the OS curve for all treated 
subjects. Associated two-sided 95% CIs will be calculated using the Greenwood formula. This 
analysis will be performed for all treated subjects or for all response evaluable subjects for PFS. 
This analysis will also be perfor med by tumor histol ogy (SQ or NSQ), by  subject subgroups, and

causes pro longation o f exist ing hospi talizat ion; resul ts in 
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y, is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect; is an important medical e vent (defined 
as a m edical event(s) that may  not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death or hospitalizat ion but, based 
upon appropriate medical and scient ific judgment, may 
jeopardi ze the subject or may  requi re intervent ion [eg, 
medical, surgica l] to prevent one of the other serious 
outcom es listed in the definit ion above). Examples of such 
events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in

APPENDIX 1 RECIST 1.1 CRITERIA
This Appendix has been excerpted from the full RECIST 1.1 criteria. For information pertaining 
to RECIST 1.1 cri teria not contained in the study  protocol  or in this Appendix, please refer to the 
full publicat ion.1
1 ASSESSMENT OF OVERAL L TUMOR BURDEN AND M EASURABLE
DISEASE
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary  to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable disease 
is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesio n.
1.1 Measurability of tumor
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categori zed measurable or non-measurable as 
follows. All baseline evaluat ions shoul d be performed as close as possible to th e treatm ent start 
and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the trea tment.
Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimensio n (longest diameter in 
the plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
 10 mm by CT scan -(CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
 10 mm caliper measur ement by  clinical  exam  (lesions whic h cannot be accurately measured 
with calipers shoul d be recorded as non -measurable)
 20 mm by  chest x -ray
 Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically e nlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only  the short axi s 
will be measured and fo llowed.
All measurements should be recorded in metric notati on, using calipers if clinically  assessed.
Speci al considerat ions regarding lesio n measurabilit y
Bone lesions:
 Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to
measure bone lesions. However, these techni ques can be used to confir m the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesio ns.
 Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed lyt ic-blast ic lesio ns, wit h ident ifiable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be 
considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of 
measurabilit y described above.
 Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.

Cystic lesions:
•Lesions that meet the criteria for ra diographically defined simple cysts s hould not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, 
by definition, simple cysts.
•Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described a bove. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment:
•Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated  area, or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion.
Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm 
or pathological lymph nodes with 10to<15mmshortaxis),aswellasnon-measurable lesions. 
Lesions considered non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lympha ngitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.
1.2 Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline a nd during follow-up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be performed rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot 
be imaged but are assessable by clinical examination.
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT scan is based on the assumption that CT 
slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.
Chest x-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest x-ray, particularly when progression is an important 
endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than x-ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, 
lesions on chest x-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded 
by aerated lung.
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 
≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers. F or the case ofskin lesions, documentation by color 
photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, when 
lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation s hould be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may be reviewed at the end of the study.

Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion s ize and s hould not be used as a 
method of measurement. If new lesions are identif ied by ultrasound in the course of the study, 
confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of thes e techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not
advised.
Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be  used to assess objective tumor response.
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ͂͂TARGET ̓AND ͂NON-TARGET ̓
LESIONS
Target lesions: When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified  as target lesions and will be rec orded and measured at 
baseline.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and s hould lend themselves to  reproducible repeated 
measurements.
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Patholog ical node s which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesi ons must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes w ill contribute to the baseline sum. All 
other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) should not be considered 
non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease)  including pathological lymph nodes 
should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements
are not required and these le sions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION AND RESPONSE CRITERIA
3.1 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Res ponse (CR): Disappearance of all target le sions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Revised Protocol No: 04
Date: 01-Dec-2017 85
Approved 5.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA209153
BMS-936558 Nivolumab
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: the appearance of  one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage  from the baseline study to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest su m diameters while on study.
Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
• Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesi ons should always have the actual short
axis measurement recorded and should be measured in the same anatomical plane as the
baseline examination, even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that
when lymph nodes are included as  target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even 
if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a shortaxis of < 10 mm.
• Target lesions that become ͂
͂too small to measure ̓: All lesions (nodal and non-nodal)
recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent
evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). If the radiologist is able to provide an actual
measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
However, when such a lesion becomes difficult to assign an exact measure to then:
i. if it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm.
ii. if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node b elieved to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm s hould be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions s hould be added together to ca lculate the target lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual le sion. If the lesions have coalesced such that 
they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the 
maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
3.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions
While some non-target lesions may actually be measura ble, they need not be  measured a nd instead 
should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.
Revised Protocol No: 04
Date: 01-Dec-2017 86
Approved 5.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA209153
BMS -936558 Nivolumab
Com plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and norm alizat ion of tumor 
marker l evel. All lymph nodes must be non -patho logical in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persi stence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker l evel above the norm al limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progressio n of existingnon-target lesions. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesio ns is also considered progressi on).
The concept of progression of non -target di sease requi res addi tional explanati on as fo llows:
When the patient also has measurable disease : To achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the 
basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of substant ial worsening in non-
target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor 
burden has increased sufficient ly to merit discontinuat ion of therapy . Amodest ‘increase’ in 
the size of one or m ore non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivo cal
progression status.
When the patient has only non-measurable disease: To achieve ‘unequivo cal progressi on’ on
the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level o f substant ialworsening such 
that the overall tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit discont inuat ion oftherapy . A 
modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually notsufficient to 
qualify  for unequivocal progression status. Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be 
easily  quantified (by definit ion: if all lesio ns are non-measurable) a useful test that can be 
applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progressi on is to consider ifthe increase in 
overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease iscomparable in 
magnitude to the increase that would be requi red to decl are PD f or m easurable disease: ie, an 
increase in tumor burden represent ing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is 
equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase 
in a pleural effusio n fro m ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangit ic disease from localized 
to wi despread, or m ay be described in protocol s as ‘sufficient to requi re achange in therapy’. 
If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the pati ent shoul d be considered to have had overall PD 
at that point.
3.3 New lesions
The appearance o f new malignant lesio ns denotes disease pr ogressi on. The finding of a new lesion 
shoul d be unequivocal : ie, not attributable to differences i n scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesio ns may be simply  healing or flare of pre-exist ing lesions). Thi s is particularly  important 
when the pat ient’s baseline lesions show pa rtial or com plete response. For example, necrosis o f a 
liver l esion may be reported on a CT scan r eport as a ‘new’ cyst ic lesion, which it i s not.
A lesio n ident ified on a follow -up study  in an a natomical l ocati on that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease pro gression. An example of this is the pat ient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals meta stases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be constitute PD even if he/she 
did not have brain imaging at baseline.

If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of its small size, con tinued therapy  and follow-
up evaluat ion will clarify  ifit represents new disease. If repeat scans confirm that there isa new 
lesion, then progressi on shoul d be declared using the date of the init ial scan.
3.4 Tumor markers
Tumor m arkers al one cannot be used to assess objective tum or resp onses. If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, however, they must normali ze in order for a patient to be considered 
as having attained a complete response.
4 EVALUATION OF BEST O VERALL RESPONSE
4.1 Time point response
A response assessment should occur at each time point specified in the protocol.
For patients who have measurable disease at baseline Appendix Table 1 provides a summary  of 
the overall response status calculat ion at each time point.

4.2 Missing assessments and inevaluable designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is no t evaluable 
(NE) at that time po int. If only a subset of les ion measurements are made at an assessment, usually 
the case is also consi dered NE at that time po int, unless a convincing argum ent can be made that 
the contribut ion of the individual missing lesion(s) woul d not change the assigned time point 
response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.

4.3 Best overall response: all timepoints
Best response determinati on in trials where confi rmation of complete or partial response IS 
requi red: Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if thecriteria for each are met at a 
subsequent time point as specified in the protocol . In thi s circumstance, the best overall r esponse 
can be interpreted as in Appendix Table 2.

and PR required

CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive disease, and NE = inevaluable.
aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any  disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on w hether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR ’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
4.4 Special notes on response assessment
When nodal  disease is included in the sum of target lesions andthe nodes decrease to ‘normal’ 
size (< 10 mm), they  may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement shoul d 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression shoul d it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this mean s that pati ents wi th CR may  not 
have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).
Patients wi th a global deteri oration of  health status requi ring di scont inuat ion of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progressi on at that time shoul d be reported as ‘symptomatic

deteri oration’. Every effort shoul d be made todocum ent objective progressi on even after 
discontinuat ion oftreatm ent. Symptomatic deterior ation is not a descriptor of an object ive 
response: it is a reason for stopping study  therapy . The objective response status of such pat ients 
is to be determined by evaluat ion of target and non-target disease as shown in Appendix Table 1 
and Table 2.
For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesio ns; cyst icchanges or 
necrosis in exist ing lesions), treatm ent may  cont inue until the n ext scheduled assessment. If at the 
next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the da te of progression should be the earlier 
date when progression was suspected.
5 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERA TIONS
5.1 Duration of response
Durati on of overall response: The durati on of overall response is measured from the time 
measuremen t criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is object ively docum ented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded on study ).
The duration of overall co mplete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is object ively documented.
Durati on of stable disease: Stabl e disease is measured from the start of the treatm ent (in
rando mized trials, from date of rando mizat ion) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study  (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for 
calculat ion of PD).
5.2 Lesions that disappear and reappea r
If a lesi on disappears and reappears at a subsequent time point it shoul d cont inue to be measured. 
However, the patient’s response at the point in time when the lesion reappears will depend upon 
the status of his/her other lesio ns. For example, if the patient’s tumour had reached a CR status 
and the lesio n reappeared, then the pat ient would be considered PD a t the time of reappearance. In 
contrast, if the tumour status was a PR or SD and one le sion which had disappeared then reappears, 
its maximal diamete r shoul d be added to the sumof the remaining lesio ns for a calculated response: 
in other words, the reappearance of an apparent ly ‘disappeared’ single lesio n amongst many which 
remain is not in itself enough to qu alify for PD: that requires the sum o f alllesio ns to meet the PD 
criteria. The rati onale for such a categori zation is based upon the realizati on that most lesions do 
not actually ‘disappear’ but are not visualized because they are bey ond the resol ving power of the 
imaging modalit y emplo yed.
5.3 Use o f FDG -PET
While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study , it is sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of 
progression (particularly  possible ‘new’ di sease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the fo llowing al gorithm:

a.Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesio n. Confirmatory  CT is recommended.
b.No FDG -PET at baseline and a posit ive FDG -PET at fo llow-up:
If the positive FDG -PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
CT, thi s is PD.
If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional fo llow-up CT scans are needed to deter mine if there is progression occurring at 
that site (if so, the date of  PD will be the date of the init ial abnorm al FDG -PET scan). If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -exist ing site of disease on CT that 
is not progressing on the basis of the anatomi c images, this is not PD.

DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent steriliza tion methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpi ngectomy
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal  state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence o f other bio logical or physio logical causes. In addit ion, females under 
the age of 55 years must have a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level > 40 
mIU/mL to confirm menopause .

Horm onal methods of contracepti on including oral contraceptive pills containing a 
combinat ion of estrogen and progesterone ,vaginal ring, injectables, implants and 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system  (IUS)c
Intrauterine device (IUD)c
Bilateral tubal occlusio n
Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
Ifnot, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified i n Secti on 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may  differ from those when used consistently and correctly . Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interactio n with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that 
the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be 
ineffective or result in in creased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative methods 
of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness

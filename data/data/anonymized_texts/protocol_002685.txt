7.RATIONALE AND BACKGR OUND
Data suggest severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) likel y follows 
a seasonalit ypattern as with other respiratory  viral infections such as influenza; where 
activity  peak sduring the traditional winter viral respiratory  season.1CDC guidance for the 
2020 and 2021 flu seasons included a recommended time interval of at least 14 day s between 
flu and CO VID-19 vaccines.2Based on updated data , the CDC has revised their
recommendations that COVID -19 vaccines may  be co -
administered with seasonal influenza 
vaccines (SIV) .3Specifically , COVID -19and SIVcan be administered concomitantly , and 
routine administration of all age -appropriate doses of vaccines simultaneously  is 
recommended for children, adolescen ts, and adults .3A systematic literature review of 
30studies revealed that when SIVand COVID -19 booster vaccines are combined, there is 
potential for an increase in the uptake of the COVID -19 vaccine, predominately because 
many  individuals are accustomed to taking SIV annua lly.4
Studies have reported similar safet y and immunogenicity among those who received 
co-administrated COVID -19 vaccine and SIV compared to those who received these 
vaccines separatel y
.5-11Three of these studies were clinical trials comparing safet y and 
immunogenicit y between SI V and COVID- 19 co -administration versus SIV or COVID -19 
alone. In these three clinical trials, no safety  concerns or immune interferences were found 
regardless of the vaccines or the age of vaccinated subjects (18-64 or 65+) .6,9-11Hause et al in 
a retrospective cohort study  of self -
reported vaccine data found a significant increase in 
reports of s ystemic reactions 0- 7 day s following co-administration of a COVID -19 mRNA 
booster vaccines with an SIVcompared to COVID -19 mRNA vaccine alone ;5whereas 
results from a VAERS database8and the 
National Health Interview Survey7analysesfound
nounusual or unexpected patterns of AEs or differences in s ymptom severity . 
Regarding efficacy /effectiveness, one study  was identified and reviewed. Novavax’s 
NVX- CoV2373 COVID -19 vaccine efficacy  when co -administered with the quadrivalent 
influenza cell -based vaccine Flucelvax (Seqirus UK, Maidenhead) among individuals aged 
18 to <65 y ears was 87
∙5% (95% CI –0∙2 to 98∙4); was slightl y attenuated compared to when 
administered alone (89 ∙8% (95% CI 79∙7–95∙5).9

Page 12of 42Although t he above studies evaluated safet y, immunogenicity  and efficacy , the proportion of 
individuals receiving concomitantly  administered COVID- 19/influenza vaccines in routine 
clinical practices is not well characterized andhas the potential to be a large perce ntage of 
vaccine recipients. Further, it is unknown whether receiving COVID -19/influenza vaccines 
concomitantly  alters 
subsequent health outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study  is to 
evalua te within the context of a large national healthcare claims database in the US the 
proportion of bivalent COVID -19/influenza vaccines concomitantly  administered; the 
characteristics of patients who receive concomitant administration and subsequent 
health 
outcomes among groups defined b y vaccine administration.
8.RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
Primary Objective 1:To describe the proportion of Pfizer -BioNTech bivalent mRNA 
COVID -19/influenza vaccines that are concomitantly  administered, and the characteristics of 
patients who receive concomitant administration.
Primary Objective 2:To estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) of concomitant administration 
of a single dose of the mRNA Pfizer
-BioNTech bivalent COVID- 19 vaccine and a licensed 
flu vaccine versus either vaccine alone against all-cause hospitalization or acute respir atory  
illness requiring hospitalization, emergency  department/urgent care or outpatient encounters.
9. RESEARCH METHODS 
9.1.Study Design
This structured secondary data collection study will be a retrospective, cohort design to 
describe concomitant vaccine uptak e and subsequent outcom esduring one influenza 
vaccination season . Individuals will be indexed on the date of their first Pfizer -BioNTech 
mRNA bivalent COVID -19or influenza vaccine. Exposure groups will be assigned as 
follows: 
Group 1: Same day  (Pfizer -BioNTech  mRNA bivalent COVID and flu on the same 
day); 
Group 2: COVID alone ( Pfizer -BioNTech  bivalent COVI D onl y); 
Group 3: flu alone (influenza vaccine of an y type only). 
  
Aone year lookback period prior to the index vaccination will be used to identify covariates. 
Individuals will be followed starting 15 days after vaccination until experiencing one of the 
following: 1) outcome 2) disen rollment 3) receipt of a second vaccine of the same t ype 4) 
receipt of the other vaccine or an y type of COVID -19vaccine 5) end of data or 6) death. 
Only  Pfizer -BioNTech mRNA bivalent COVID -19vaccine will be assessed. All ty pes of 
influenza vaccine s recom mended for the eligible population will be eligible for inclusion , but 
for the 65+ age group only enhanced influenza vaccines will be included .

All outcomes will be assessed starting on Day  15. All hospitalization related outcomes in the 
table below will be ascertained using acute facility stay s onl y. Inpatient stays classified as 
skilled nursing facility  or rehabilitation will not be used. COVID-19 and flu hospitaliz ations 
will be assess edin an y position and in the primary position to mitigate possibility  of 
hospital ization with the disease versus for the disease. 
COVID -19related endpoints will be identified using the following ICD -10-CM diagnosis 
code: U07.1.
Influenza will be identified using the following ICD-10- CM diagnosis codes: J 09.X , J10.X, 
J11.X .
We will evaluate three negative control outcomes. These outcomes are unrela ted to 
vaccination and likel y share similar confounding patterns for health -seeking beha viors. These 
negative control s have been used in other studies of comparative VE of influenza vaccines or 
COVID -19VE.13-15Urinar y tract infection and a ccidental injury  areoutcome sthat could 
different iate patients who seek medical care versus those who do not , and is l ikely  a better 
choice of outcome for younger adults .Hospitalization in the first 14 day s(ie,among recentl y 
vaccinated) uses time as a negative control, in that the vaccine likely could not biologicall y 
prevent 
health events until adequate levels of immunity  has been achieved.

Optum’s Clinformatics Data Mart (CDM) comes from a database of administra tive health 
claims for me mbers of a large national managed care company  affiliated with Optum. The 
database includes over 73million unique lives (200 7through 20 21). Clinformatics Data Mart 
is statistically  de-identifie d under the Expert Determination met hod consistent with HI PAA
and managed according to Optum customer data use agreements. These a dministrative claims 
submitted for pay ment by  providers and pharmacies are verified, adjudicated, adjusted, and 
de
-identified prior to inclusion. The Claims data comprises both commercial /employ er 
sponsored plans and Medicare Advantage health plan data. This data covers ~30% of the 
national Medicare Advantage population. The population is geographicall y diverse, spanning 
all 50 s tates. I n addition to medical claims and pharmacy  claims, the Claims data includes 
tables with member eligibility  and inpatient confinements. The Claims data also includes 
standard pricing for all medical claims, pharmacy  claims, and inpatient confinements . 
Mortality  is provided as month and year of death and is sourced from Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Servies, Social Securit y Administration Death Master File, facility  claims wi th 
inpatient death, discontinuation of coverage due to death and external obituary  data.

Page 33of 42To account forimbalance in patient characteristics b etween the vaccine exposure groups , 
2separate logistic regression models will be used to create a propensity  score used to 
calculate an inverse probability  of treatment weights (I PTW). The two models will be as 
follows: Same day vs COVID - 19 alone, and sep arately  Same day  vs Flu alone. Weights will 
be stabilized to avoid exertion of outliers, and we will further evaluate whether there is a 
need to truncate at the 1stand 99thpercentile. Covariate balance before and after weighting 
will be assessed using st andardized mean differences, separatel y for the same day /COVID -19
alone and Same day /flu alone comparisons. All variables listed in “ Covariates” section with 
model specification instructions will be included in the score. If there are model convergence 
issues, changes in model specification may  occur (eg , dropping variabl es with very  low 
prevalence, categories may  be collapsed further etc). Variables with residual imbalance will 
be included in the model for further adjustment. 
Each outcome will be assessed separatel y. Experiencing onedisease specific outcome is not a 
censoring criteria for the other disease (ie , having a COVID-19 outpatient diagnosis is not a 
censoring event for the influenza endpoints). W eighted cumulative incide nce curves will be 
used to describe the occurrence of each outcome separately  over the entire follow -up period. 
Given the relativel y short follow -up time, we expect small numbers of deaths. Therefore, 
regular Cox proportional hazar ds models will be used to estimate HRs and 95% CIfor each 
outcome separatel y. If we find that death is more common than anticipated, we will consider 
using Fine and Gray ’s proportional subdistribution hazards models to account for the 
competing risk of de ath. Models for the follo
wing vaccine group/outcome combinations will 
be assess ed:
Same day /COVID -19only:
All-cause hospitalization, composite COVID -19 hospitalization/ED/UC (any  
position), COVI D-19 hospitalization (any position, primary  position), COVID - 19
ED/UC, COVID -19outpatient
Same day /Flu onl y:
All-cause hospitalization, composite flu -hospitalization/ED/UC (any  position), 
flu-hospitalization (any  position, primary  position), flu ED/UC, flu outpatient.

Page 34of 42Sensitivity Analysis
For disease specific endpoints, we will conduct a sensitivity  anal ysis whe reby an additional 
censoring criteria will be applied. For COVID-19 specific endpoints, we will censor for 
Paxlovid dispensing. For influenza specific endpoints, we will censor for any of the 
following influenza treatment dispensin g (Oseltamivir phosphate ,Zanamivir , Peramivi r, 
Balox avir marboxil ).
9.8.Quality Control
Data in Optum’s claims database are collected monthly  in an electronic forma t.Analy sesare 
programmed according to the specifications in the protocol and documented in a 
programming 
plan.All ana lyses will be performed inte rnally  and according to Pfizer anal ytic 
standards, including double programming to ensure quality  control. All quality checks are 
documented in the programming plan.
9.9.Limitations of the R esearch M ethods
There are several limitati ons associated with this study . This anal ysis is from one insurer that 
provides employ er-sponsored and Medicare Advantage coverage and thus may  not generalize 
to other populations, such as traditional Medicare fee -for-service , other government 
insurance or uninsured . It is possible that some vaccin es may  be missing if patients received 
vaccine in a setting where an insurance claim was not filed (ie employ er sponsored clinic or 
paid out of pocket) . This may  be more problematic for i nfluenza vaccine for y oung er ages . 
This will only  impact the singular vaccine groups (ie, COVID -
19 alone or influenza alo ne). 
The healthcare claims data are collected for billing purposes and may  be subject to 
misclassification, misdiagnosis, and underrepo rting. Additionall y, for o ur medically  attended 
COVID -19endpoints, we do not have laboratory  confirmation of the COVID -19 diagnosis, 
therefore it is possible that some patients are being diagnosed with sy mptoms alone or that 
we are missing positive cases due to at -home testing.

This study  uses de -identified data. As such this study  will be submitted to an I RB for 
exemption unde r category 4, pursuant to the terms of the US Department of Health and 
Human Service’s Policy  for Protection of human Subjects at 45 C.F.R 46.104(d).
10.4. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requireme nts, as well as 
with scientific purpose, value and rigor and follow generall y accepted research practices 
described in 
Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepide miologic Practices (GPP) ,20Good Practices 
for Outcomes Research issued by  the International Society  for Pharmacoeconomics and 
Outcomes Research (I SPOR) ,21and Food a nd Drug Administration (F DA) Guidance for

11.MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS 
This study  involves data that exist as structure d data by  the time of study start . In these data 
sources, individual patient data are not retrieved or validated, and it is not possible to link 
(ie, identify  a potential association between) a particular product and medical event for any  
individual. Thus, the minimum criteria for reporti ng an adverse event (AE) (ie , identifiable 
patient, identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and event) cannot be met .
12.PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING STUDY RESULTS
For all publications relating to the study ,Pfizer will comply with recognized ethical
standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II -“Ethical
Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for 
Manuscripts Submitte d to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.htm l#authorship, 
established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (eg, clinical hold) by an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the part y responsible for collecting data 
from the participan t is aware of an y new information which might influence the evaluation of 
the benefits and risks of a Pfizer product, Pfizer should be informed immediately .

1. The predominant variant was defined as the variant representing highest estimated percent of viral lineages among 
infections in a given week. Variant sublineage proportions were combined with the parent lineages. 
2. The percent of viral lineages among infections was calculated using weekly weighted estimates from the CDC’s 
national genomic surveillance system. The CDC’s weighted estimates are based on empirical (ob served) genomic 
sequencing data from the National SARS -CoV -2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) program, commercial or academic 
laboratories contracted by CDC, and state/local public health laboratories. Estimated percentages were calculated using 
data as of 14 April 2023.

Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 3 of 65 1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Sponsor : Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.  
Protocol Number: XT-150-1-0302  
Name of Investigational Product: XT-150 
Protocol Title: A Placebo -controlled, Double -blind Evaluation of Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy 
of XT -150 for the Treatment of Facet Joint Osteoarthritis Pain  
Study center(s): 3 Phase: Phase 2a 
Objectives  
• Primary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a  repeat bilateral intra-articular dose of 
XT-150 
• Secondary: To establish the analgesic efficacy of a repeat  bilateral intra -articular dose of XT -
150 as a treatment for pain in participants with facet joint osteoarthritis (FJOA)  
Study Design  
This is a Phase 2a safety and efficacy study of XT -150 in adult  participants experiencing back pain 
due to inflammation of the facet joint osteoarthritis (FJOA) and who are eligible for intra -articular 
glucocorticoid injection, or radiofrequency ablation of medial branches of the primary dorsal ramus of 
the exiting ne rve root, which innervates the adjacent facet joints.  
Participants will provide informed consent and meet all study eligibility criteria before any study procedures are initiated. Baseline assessments for study eligibility will be completed on the same day  
as or within 1 day before administration of study drug.  
Study drug will be administered at Day 0 and Day 90 by bilateral intra -articular (IA) injection into the 
facet capsule, at the affected spinal level (e.g.  L3-4, L4 -5, or L5 -S1) as determined by imaging (e.g., 
MRI, CT , X-Ray, etc.) and physical exam. Location responsible for facetogenic pain of the spine will 
be determined by clinical, radiological and diagnostic (lidocaine) intra -articular injection.  
Approximately 72 participants will be randomized to placebo or one of two dose treatment groups (24 
participants per treatment group).  
1. 150 µg XT -150 (1.0mL total delivered by two 0.5 mL injections)  
2. 450 µg XT -150 (1.0mL total delivered by two 0.5 mL injections)  
3. Placebo (Sterile saline) (1.0ml total delivered by two 0.5 mL injections)  
Following the first treatment with XT-150 or Placebo at Baseline (Day 0), participants will be assessed for safety and efficacy in -clinic on Days 7, 14, 30 and 60. At Day 90, all par ticipants will 
receive a repeat injection with XT -150 or Placebo based on treatment arm assignment at the time of 
randomization. Following Day 90, participants will be assessed approximately monthly through Day 270. 
Participants who have passed their Day 9 0 visit or who were enrolled prior to the implementation of 
Protocol V3.0 08Jun2022 and do not reconsent to a second dose will complete the study at Day 180. During this visit, all End of Study visit activities should be completed. 
The Schedule of Assessments and Procedures is presented in  Table  1. Day 0 is defined as the day of 
study drug administration. Subsequent study days are defined by the number of consecutive calendar 
days after drug administration.  
Number of Participants and Treatment Groups   
Approximately 72 participants will be enrolle d in one of 2 XT -150 treatment groups or placebo (24 
participants/group).

5. Have had a positive diagnostic facet pain block with lidocaine; admittance if subject gains 50% relief of pain within 30 minutes of test injection 
6. Be free of local or intra -articular infection, tumor or other causes of localized LBP, for 
example, spondylolysis/pars defect, and adjacent vertebral body compression fracture based on imaging evaluation.  
7. Symptomatic disease because of osteo arthritis, established by imaging of facet joint and 
defined as a worst pain of at least 50 at the Screening  Visit  and the Baseline (Day 0)  Visit  
(based on scale of 0 to 100, with 100 representing “pain as bad as you can imagine”) using Visual Analog Scale (VAS).  
8. Stable analgesic regimen during the 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Participants who are not currently on any analgesics at the time of enrollment because they have discontinued prior 
analgesic therapy due to intolerance or lack of effect may be included. New analgesics or 
changes to the pre-established regimen during the study, with the exception of rescue medication use, are not permitted. 
9. Inadequate pain relief with prior therapies lasting ≥ 3 months.  
10. In the judgment of the Investigator, acceptable general medical condition

Investigational Product, Dose and Mode of Administration 
XT-150 is a plasmid DNA ( ) formulated in buffered, 
 saline solution.  
Participants will be randomly enrolled into 1 of 3 treatment arms to receive either Placebo or XT-150 
(150 µg, 450 µg)  on Day 0 and Day 90. Two 0.5 mL intra -articular (facet) injections (for a total dose 
of 1.0 mL) administered bilaterally will deliver pla cebo or study drug in a 1:1:1 ratio.  
Diagnostic injection with 0.5 mL lidocaine solution at the affected levels, as determined by imaging and physical exam, L3 -4, L4 -5, or L5-S1 (or the three lumbar cephalad to the sacrum in the case of 
patients with a 6
th lumbar vertebral body). The injection will be performed with fluoroscopic 
guidance, using the ipsilateral oblique projection. A spinal needle will be placed in an intra -articular 
position, after local anesthesia of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The p atient will be observed for 1 
hour after this injection.

4.4.1. Potential Benefits  
Participants will receive active investigational product  or phosphate- buffered saline injection 
(placebo). The effects of XT -150 for FJOA have not been previously explored, however 
potential therapeutic benefits of XT -150 for the treatment of FJOA pain are:  
• Increased mobility for many weeks following a single dose of XT -150 
• Reduction in requirement for pain medications and therapies 
• Reduction in pain symptoms for many weeks following a single dose of XT-150. 
4.4.2. Known Risks  
Intra -articular injection in the knee with XT -150 has been well tolerated in clinical trials of OA 
pain. Based on multiple animal studies and 4 clinical trials in osteoarthritis, XT -150- related 
adverse events are most commonly minor injection site reactions.  
4.4.3. Potential Risks  
Nonclinical studies and clinical studies with XT -150 are described in the IB. XT-150 posed 
minimal risk in these studies. General risks associated with IA injection are injection site 
reactions and infection, which will be explicitly captured in follow- up safety assessments.  
4.4.3.1. Safety of DNA as a Therapeutic Agent 
DNA as a t herapeutic agent has been well tolerated. The main theoretical safety concerns 
regarding the clinical use of DNA are that they might integrate with the host/patient DNA, or that injection of foreign DNA might stimulate anti-DNA antibodies or an autoimmune reaction (Prazeres 2014 ).  
With both DNA vaccines and DNA plasmids, the risk of integration was repeatedly found to be low with years of research into the possibility ( FDA 2007; Prazeres 2014) . With plasmids, the 
potential for integration has been removed by excluding any sequences that might drive 
homologous recombination and integration into the genome. In fact, excluding these elements 
lowers the risk of plasmid integration to less than the rate of naturally occurring mutations (Prazeres 2014 ). XT-150 has been designed to transiently express a variant of human IL-10 
without integrating into the genome. 
Immunogenicity of DNA appears to be low ( Ferraro 2011) , and correlates to the lack of success 
of DNA agents (even pathoge nic bacterial sequences) as vaccines. No link has been found 
between plasmid DNA injections and any clinical markers of autoimmunity ( Prazeres 2014 ). In 
addition, DNA plasmids have been used in research and development for 25 years. Synthetic 
vectors share the non -infectious properties of viral vectors and elicit low immunogenicity and 
lower toxicity compared to viral vectors ( Xu 2011; Gôrecki 2006). 
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 23 of 65 4.4.4. Safety of Interleukin -10 
Published studies in the literature have reported IL-10 protein therapy to be safe in humans. The 
safety of IL -10 protein injections was studied in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 μg/kg. 
Details of these studies can be found in the IB.  
After injection in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 μg/kg, wild-type human IL- 10 protein 
was found to be rapidly degraded with a half-life of 2.0 to 4.5 hours ( Chernoff 1995; Huhn 1996; 
Huhn 1997; Milligan, 2005). In the Huhn, 1997 study, after intravenous administration of high doses of IL-10 protein (100 µg/kg), 42% (15/36) of the volunteers experienced flu- like adverse 
effects, the mos t common of which were headache (11/36 participants, 31%), fever (5/36, 14%), 
and back pain (3/36, 8%). Pharmacodynamic effects from intravenous IL-10 treatment included transient increases in neutrophils and monocytes, and decreases in lymphocytes, which peaked around 6 hours after injection ( Chernoff, 1995) . When given intravenously, IL -10 was also found 
to inhibit production of the cytokines IL- 1β and tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α), and reduc e 
T-lymphocyte stimulation.  
Recombinant human IL -10 has been clinically tested as a therapy in humans in a number of 
indications without serious or irreversible side effects. In these trials, IL -10 injections of up to 25 
µg/kg were reported to be well tole rated. With chronic intravenous and high doses, statistically 
significant hematological changes were observed, as well as fever. Adverse events of 
neutrophilia, headache, injection site pain, anemia, and nausea were observed with daily dosages 
in patients with Crohn’s Disease.  
As an anti -inflammatory agent, the biological activity of IL -10 is different than that of other 
interleukins. Exogenous IL-10 is the only interleukin shown to be well tolerated. However, the anti-inflammatory activity of IL -10 treatme nt could mask latent infections ( Moore, 2001). Since 
IL-10 has been theorized to mask latent infections, any participant who has a current 
autoimmune condition or documented immunodeficiency, has a history of immunosuppression, or is currently receiving treatment with immunosuppressive agents is excluded from this study.  
Note that XT -150 is a sterile aqueous formulation of a plasmid designed to transiently express a 
proprietary variant of IL -10. XT-150 expression of the variant IL- 10 is expected to be safer than 
systemic injection of active IL -10 protein as therapy for the following reasons:  
• Rather than injections of IL -10 protein, XT- 150 treatment will result in IL -10v levels that 
exist transiently  and at a much lower concentration.  
• The IL-10v levels from XT-150 expression will be localized in the intra- articular joint 
space. Low systemic levels of IL -10 from XT -150 treatment may be present for short 
periods of time and if present are unlikely to l ead to adverse effects,  
. 
4.4.5. Possible Anticipated Adverse Events and Clinical Monitoring  
Anticipated AEs for which there will be specific safety monitoring in humans will be based on 
the preclinical studies  as well as the published reports of studies of 
IL-10 protein injections to healthy volunteers. In a publication of the incidence and 
characteristics of intra -articular facet joint injection by Kim, 2020, the incidence of major 
procedure- related complications, such as local injections site infection, was demonstrated to be

6.1. Description of the Study  
This is a Phase 2a, safety and efficacy study of XT-150 in adult participants experiencing back 
pain due to inflammation of the facet joint (Facet Joint Osteoarthritis [FJOA]) and who are 
eligible for intra -articular glucocorticoid injection, or radiofrequency ablation of medial branches 
of the primary dorsal ramus of the exiting nerve root, which innervates the adjacent facet joints.  
Participants will provide informed consent and meet all study eligibility criteria before any study procedures are initiated. Baseline assessments for study eligibility will  be completed on the same 
day as or within 1 day before administration of study drug.  
Study drug will be administered  at Day 0 and Day 90 by intra- articular (IA) injection into the 
facet capsules, bilaterally at the affected spinal level (e.g. L4-5 and L5-S1). Location responsible 
for facetogenic pain of the spine will be determined by clinical, radiological and diagnostic 
(lidocaine) intra -articular injection.  
Up to 72 participants will be randomized to one of two dose treatment groups or to placebo (24 
participants per treatment group).  
1. 150 µg XT-150 (1.0 mL total delivered by two 0.5 mL injections) 
2. 450 µg XT-150 (1.0 mL total delivered by two 0.5 mL injections) 
3. Placebo (Sterile phosphate- buffered saline for injection, PBS) (1.0 mL total delivered by 
two 0.5 mL injections).  
Following the first treatment with XT -150 or Placebo at Baseline (Day 0), participants will be 
assessed for safety and efficacy in -clinic on Days 7, 14, 30 and 60. At Day 90, all participants 
will receive a repeat injection with XT -150 or Placebo based on treatment arm assignment at the 
time of randomization. Following Day 90, participants will be assessed approximately monthly through Day 270. 
Participants who have passed their Day 90 visit or who were enrolled prior to the imple mentation 
of Protocol V3.0 08Jun2022 and do not reconsent to a second dose will complete the study at 
Day 180. During this visit, all End of Study visit activities should be completed. The Schedule of Assessments and Procedures is presented in  Table  1. Day 0 is defined as the day 
of study drug administration. Subsequent study days are defined by the number of consecutive 
calendar days after drug  administration.  
6.2. Follow Up Assessments 
All participants will be assessed for physical examination findings and vital signs following signing of the informed consent form (ICF) and for AEs and SAEs, throughout the study for each 
treatment group.  
Serum sam ples will be collected from all participants to test for the presence of anti- IL-10 
antibodies and IL-10 protein. Samples will be analyzed using a validated assay by an 
independent, central bioanalytical laboratory. Procedures for collection, storage, and shipping of immunogenicity samples are described in the study Lab Manual.  
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 29 of 65 Whole blood samples will be collected from all participants to test for the presence of XT -150 
plasmid. Samples will be analyzed using a validated assay by an independent, central 
bioanalytical laboratory. Procedures for collection, storage, and shipping of immunogenicity 
samples are described in the study Lab Manual.  
Efficacy assessments will be performed at Baseline, on Day 7, Day 14, Day 30, and 
approximately monthly thereafter fo r up to 9 months. Efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at 
each study visit and overall. 
A telephone call documenting safety and efficacy assessments may be used for participants 
unable to physically attend follow up visits due to COVID- 19 infection or SARS -CoV-2 
exposure concerns. Home services may be employed for blood collections. 
6.3. Number of Participants  
Up to 72 participants will receive study drug administration and evaluated. 
6.4. Expected Duration of Subject Participation  
Subject participation will require a commitment of approximately 9 months of safety, tolerability, and efficacy evaluation. In addition, a screening visit will occur up to 30 days before 
enrollment.  
Baseline assessments for study eligibility will be completed within one day before study d rug 
administration. Day 0 is defined as the day of study drug administration. Subsequent study days are defined by the number of consecutive calendar days thereafter. 
Follow-up visits will occur on Study Day 7, Study Day 14, Study Day 30, and approximately 
monthly thereafter.  
6.5. Method of Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
After informed consent has been obtained, participants will be screened for study eligibility before enrollment.  
Participants will be randomly enrolled into one of 3 groups, two XT- 150 treat ment groups (150 
μg or 450 μg) or placebo.  
Instructions for study drug preparation and dosing are given in Section  8.

may be repeated one time to identify the joint that is causing pain.  
7.4. Participant Withdrawal Criteria  
7.4.1. Withdrawal from Study Protocol 
Participants who wish to withdraw completely from this clinical study should be encouraged to complete the assessments for Day 270 /Termination. However, participants may withdraw 
consent to participate in this study at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the 
participant is otherwise entitled. Every reasonable effort should be made to determine the reason 
a participant withdraws prematurely, and this information should be recorded on the appropriate 
page(s) of the case report form (CRF). Participants may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Participant unable or unwilling to continue  
• Participant’s perceived lack  of benefit 
• Participant elects to withdraw informed consent  
• Due to an adverse event  
• Protocol non- compliance  
• Participant is lost to follow up  
• The PI considers that it is in the participant’s best interest not to continue participation in the study  
7.4.2. Early Dis continuation from Study Drug Administration  
If a participant needs to discontinue study drug, the reason (i.e. due to an SAE, need for an 
excluded medication, etc.) should be documented in the eCRF.  
NOTE: The Medical Monitor should be contacted to discuss whether to continue with planned 
XT-150 dosing in the event that the participant situation changes significantly in the 24 hours 
prior to XT -150 injection such that participant safety is at risk.

After randomization, withdrawn participants will not be replaced.  
7.6. Study Termination by Sponsor and Termination Criteria 
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate an investigational site or this clinical study at any 
time. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies of XT -150 indicate a 
potential health hazard to participants 
• Serious or persistent noncompliance by the Investigator with the protocol, clinical 
research agreement, or applicable regu latory guidelines in conducting the study 
• IRB decision to terminate or suspend approval for the investigation or the Investigator  
• Investigator request to withdraw from participation  
• Participant enrollment is unsatisfactory  
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 35 of 65 Data from pilot studies in animals showed that saline solutions produce no efficacious benefit in 
a wide variety of pain models. PBS has not demonstrated clinical benefit for pain and is therefore 
suitable for use as a placebo.  
8.2. Investigational Product Administration 
Investigational product (XT- 150 or placebo) will be administered as two bolus, bilateral intra -
articular injections into the facet joint. The injection will be performed with fluoroscopic 
guidance. 
8.3. XT-150 Blinding  
The Investigator, study staff, and participants will be blinded to the treatment administration. The unblinded pharmacy will provide ready- to-use syringes, coded by participant number to the 
clinical staff. The Pharmacy will maintain a log in a secure location with the participant number 
and the assigned lot number of the investigational product. Lot numbers are unique to dosage 
strengths.  
8.4. Compliance 
Treatment compliance for intra -articular study drugs will be documented in the CRF by 
recording the date, injection time , and whether the dose of study drug was completely injected. 
8.5. Previous and Concomitant Medications and Substances 
All pain therapy (both medications and treatments) and all prescription and over- the-counter 
medications and supplements administered within the last month prior to enrollment will be 
documented in the CRF. 
8.5.1. Prohibited Medications  
See exclusion criteria (Section  7.2).  
The following treatments are prohibited prior to study drug administration at Day 0 and Day 90: 
• Current treatment with antibiotics or antiviral agents (exception: topical treatments)  
• Current treatment with immunosuppressive agents  
• Current use of systemic steroids (equivalent to >10 mg/day prednisone) 
• Current treatment with anticoagulants, other than low -dose aspirin. Patients, if medically 
feasible, can interrupt anticoagulant therapy by following local medical practice protocol 
for intra -articular injections for patients on anticoagulant, antiplatelet therapy. 
Concomitant medications for pain will be allowed at doses and frequencies prescribed prior to 
the study treatment. In the event a participant requires additional analgesic treatment during 
study participation, he/she should take the protocol- speci fied rescue medication.  Introduction of 
new medications to treat FJOA pain during the study period is prohibited and considered a protocol deviation.

Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 43 of 65 10. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
10.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed through the evaluation of AEs, vital signs, and serum laboratory data 
according to the Schedules of Assessments and Procedures presented in Table  1 and assessment 
of anti- IL-10 antibodies as described in Section  12. 
10.2. Adverse Events 
Medical history will be collected for all participants at the time of informed consent. After consent, all adverse events ( AEs)/serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be collected  through the 
last study visit on Day 270 . All AEs/SAEs that occur during or after the time of study drug 
treatment will be considered treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs). The Investigator will assess all 
AEs and SAEs and will record the following information on the appropriate CRF page and SAE 
Report Form (as applicable) : 
• Event term  
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution or stabilization  
• Severi ty 
• Relationship to study drug  
• Action taken with study medication  
Medically indicated laboratory tests (emergency or unscheduled tests) should be conducted at the 
local laboratory. The Investigator should employ best medical judgment in determining how to 
manage AEs and SAEs. Any questions regarding AE or SAE management should be directed to 
the Medical Monitor.  
10.3. Adverse Event Reporting  
The Sponsor has obligations for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific criteria to worldwide regul atory authorities. Therefore, the Sponsor must be notified immediately regarding 
any SAE that occurs after informed consent.  
All SAEs must be reported to the Medical Monitor or C ontract R esearch Organization (CRO) 
Drug Safety Team  within 24 hours of the investigational site’s knowledge of the event. 
All SAEs and discontinuations due to AEs will be reported to the IRB based on the IRB’s 
reporting requirements. 
The study site will transmit a SAE report to the CRO Drug Safety Team by email or facsimile  
(email is preferred method) within 24 hours. Contact details will be provided to all sites. An 
initial report can be made via telephone, but a completed SAE report must still be emailed or 
faxed within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event. The study sit es will be provided with 
SAE report forms wherein the following information is requested. 
• Participant identification, Investigator name, and site number  
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 44 of 65 • SAE information: event term, onset date, severity, and causal relationship 
• The outcome(s) attributable to the event (i.e., death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient 
hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity, or other important medical event[s])  
• A summary of relevant test results, pertinent laboratory data, and any other relevant 
medical history  
• The first and last dates of study drug administration. NOTE: as this is a double -blind 
study, SAE reports should not indicate specific study drug assignments 
• Indicate if the study drug was discontinued or the study drug administration schedule was modified  
• Supplemental information may include the following hospital records: laboratory 
results, radiology reports, progress notes, admission and emergency room notes, 
holding and observation notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death certificates  
In addition, relevant CRF pages should be appended to communicate relevant study drug and participant outcome information. The SAE report should be emailed or faxed  within 24 hours 
with as much of the above information as available at the time. The following minimum 
information is required for reporting an SAE: participant identification, reporting source, the 
event , and the causality assessed by the Investigator (or medically qualified designee) . 
Supplem ental information may be transmitted using a follow -up SAE report and should not 
delay the initial report. The Sponsor or designee may contact the investigational site to solicit 
additional information or follow up on the event.  
The Investigator must take  all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE. Any 
medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded on the 
appropriate pages of the participant’s CRF.  
10.4. Definitions  
10.4.1. Adverse Event  
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any 
judgment about causality. An AE can arise with any use of the drug and with any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
Facet Joint Osteoarthritis -related events should not be considered or recorded as AEs or SAEs.  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical interve ntion. However, each laboratory 
abnormality (e.g., clinically significant changes detected on hematology, or lab chemistries) independent from any underlying medical condition that requires medical or surgical intervention, or that leads to interruption of study drug infusion or discontinuation, must be 
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 45 of 65 recorded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a clinical 
condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the 
individual laboratory abnormality. In addition, laboratory abnormalities or other abnormal test 
assessments that are associated with signs or symptoms must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they 
meet the definition of an AE (or SAE) as described above or in Section  10.4.4. 
10.4.2. Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction  
A suspected adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the drug and the 
AE. Suspected adverse drug reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
10.4.3. Life-Threatening AE or Life -Threatening Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is considered ‘‘life threatening’’ if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or participant at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
10.4.4. Serious AE or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE – see definition above  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life fu nctions 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant who received study 
drug 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
10.4.4.1. Serious Adverse Event Definition Clarifications 
• Death is an outcome of an AE, an d not an AE in itself  
• All deaths during study drug administration or up to the follow-up ( FU) visit on Day 
180, regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported  
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 46 of 65 • “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the participant is actively receiving study 
drug at the time of the event 
• “Life -threatening” means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, had it occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that o ccur during hospitalizations are AEs. If an AE prolongs 
hospitalization, it is a SAE.  
• “Inpatient hospitalization” means the participant has been formally admitted to a 
hospital for medical reasons, for any length of time. This may or may not be 
overnight. It does not include presentation and care within an emergency department (although an emergency department visit may define a medically important event, 
which is also considered a SAE).  
• The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE or SAE, rather than as the individual signs or symptoms. 
10.4.5. Unexpected AE or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected ad verse drug reaction is considered “unexpected” if:  
• It is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed  
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
severity) if an Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of 
greater specificity) if an Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
‘‘Unexpected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that 
are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
10.5. Adverse Event Classification  
10.5.1. Relationship to Investigational Drug 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non -
serious) ( Table  5). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. 
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 47 of 65 Table  5: Guidelines for Assessing Relationship of Event to Study Drug  
Unrelated  There is little or no chance that the Investigational Product caused the AE; other 
conditions, including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of the disease 
state, or a reaction to a concomitant medication best explain the event  
Related  The association of the AE with the Investigational Product is unknown, however, the 
AE is not clearly due to another condit ion, or a reasonable temporal association exists 
between the AE and treatment administration and, based on the Investigator's clinical 
experience, the association of the AE with the Investigational Product seems likely  
10.5.2. Severity  
All AEs will be graded for severity to describe the maximum intensity of the AE based on 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 5.0) (National Cancer Institute, 2017). For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined in Table  6 . 
Table  6: Guidelines for Severity Assessments  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money)  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden)  
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5  Death related to adverse event 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for determining 
the causal assessment. If the event is believed to be unrelated to study drug administration, then 
an alternative explanation should be provided. 
10.6. Adverse Event Follow -up 
All unresolved SAEs (“ongoing” at discharge) will be followed by the study staff until resolution or deemed stable.  
10.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
10.7.1. Adverse Events of Noted Interest in IL -10 Protein Trials  
Safety will include the following reported IL -10 protein- associated toxicities as defined by 
CTCAE (v5.0). Systemic levels of XT 150 produced IL-10 protein are expe cted to be more than 
1000-fold lower than when given as a protein solution ( Huhn, 1997); and XT -150 will be 
predominately localized to the facet joint space.  
• Grade 1 (unexplained) fever – 38.6°C to 39°C 
Xalud Therapeutics, Inc.   Protocol XT- 150-1- 0302  
Version 3.0, 08Jun2022  Confidential  Page 48 of 65 • Grade 2 allergic, cytokine release, or infusion -related reactions - Therapy or infusion 
interruption indicated but responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., 
antihistamines, NSAIDS, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic medications indicated for 
≤24 hours  
• Grade 2 injection site reaction - Pain; lipodystrophy; edema; phlebitis 
• Grade 2 neutropenia - <1500 to 1000/mm3; <1.5 to 1.0 x109/L 
10.7.2. Localized Signs of Infection or Inflammation at the Injection Site  
Events that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may represent localized signs of infection or inflammation at the XT -150 injection site (e.g., pain, erythema, swelling, pruritus, warmth, 
hematoma, induration) must be recorded as AEs on the CRF. In general, these events will be temporally related to the injection.  
10.8. Toxicity Management 
The Investigator should employ best medical judgment in determining how to manage AEs. Any questions regarding AE management should be directed to the Medical Monitor. 
10.9. Risks for Women of Childbearing Potential or During Pre gnancy 
The risks of XT -150 administration during pregnancy have not been evaluated. Male and female 
participants who are heterosexually active and not surgically sterile must agree to use effective contraception, including abstinence, for the duration of the study. 
During the study, participants should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they 
suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle). The Investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor or CRO Drug Sa fety Team of any female participant or 
female partner of any male participant that becomes pregnant at any time during study participation . All pregnancies must be reported to the Medical Monitor  or CRO Drug Safety 
Team using the Pregnancy Report Form with in 24 hours of the investigational site’s knowledge 
of the event. The Medical Monitor/CRO will ask the site to  obtain a separate consent from the 
female participant (or female partner of a male participant) using an IRB-approved template in order to  follow -up periodically during the pregnancy for ongoing health and safety information 
through the end of the pregnancy, as applicable.  
Any anomalies, complications, abnormal outcomes, or birth defect(s) observed in the child must 
be reported as a SAE using the SAE Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator or study 
personnel’s first knowledge. While elective and uncomplicated induced abortion not required for 
medical reasons does not constitute an AE or SAE (even if the patient or patient’s partner is hospitalized to undergo abortion), spontaneous abortion is considered a fatal event and must be 
reported as an AE and SAE, as appropriate. 
All pregnancies will be reported to the IRB based on the IRB’s reporting requirements.

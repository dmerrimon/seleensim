  Project  2 Protocol   
 
 1. OBJECTIVE   
 
Prevalence of smoking among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) is six -fold that 
of the general  US adult  population.  The mortality  rate of opioid -dependent  smokers  is four times 
that of opioid -dependent nonsmokers, and their response to smoking cessation interventions is 
notoriously  poor.  A national  policy  of reducing  the nicotine  content  of cigarettes  has the potential 
to be an effective method of reducing tobacco use prevalence, dependence, and related 
adverse  health  outcomes.  Controlled  trials  in the general  smoker  population  have  demonstrated 
that switching smokers to very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNCCs) results in reductions in 
cigarettes per day (CPD), dependence and tobacco toxicant exposure, with few adverse 
consequences. Furthermore, our work during the current funding period indicates that smokers 
with OUD also respond to reductions in cigarette nicotine content with reductions in cigarette 
demand and other measures of addiction potential, although to a lesser extent than the other 
vulnerable smoker populations we have been examining (i.e., economically disadvantaged 
women, individuals with affective disorders). We believe that the impact of reduced nicotine 
standards on use of combusted cigarettes in this highly tobacco addicted population will be 
moderated considerably by other tobacco market conditions including (1) availability of 
alternative sources of non -combusted nicotine, and (2) whether these alternatives are available 
under conditions that optimize their appeal. We hypothesize the same for other vulnerable 
populations as well, but achieving significant reductions in use of combusted cigarettes in 
smokers with OUD seems especially unlikely in the absence of readily available and appealing 
alternative sources of non -combusted nicotine.  
The goal of the proposed trial is to experimentally model whether increased availability 
and appeal of an alternative, non -combusted source of nicotine (e -cigarettes) will enhance the 
effectiveness of a reduced nicotine standard for cigarettes in smokers with OUD.  Daily smokers 
receiving methadone or buprenorphine treatment will be recruited at University of Vermont and 
Johns  Hopkins  University  and randomized  to one of the following  conditions:  (1) normal  nicotine 
content cigarettes (NNCC) alone, serving as the control condition, (2) VLNCCs alone, (3) 
VLNCCs  + tobacco -flavored  nicotinized  e-cigarettes  (TF e-cigs),  or (4) VLNCCs  + nicotinized  e- 
cigarette with preferred flavoring (PF e -cigs). Participants will be asked to use only their 
assigned products for 16 weeks. Outcome measures include total CPD, product demand using 
behavioral -economic purchase tasks, craving, withdrawal, and biomarkers of tobacco toxicant 
exposure. In Week 17, participants will abstain from combusted cigarette use and we will 
assess effects on cigarette craving, withdrawal and demand.  
This research  will address  the following  specific  aims:  
Aim 1 (Primary):  To compare  the effects  of: (1) NNCCs  alone,  (2) VLNCCs  alone,  (3) VLNCCs  + 
TF e-cigs and (4) VLNCCs  + PF e-cigs on total CPD  in smokers  with OUD.  We hypothesize  that 
at Week 16, total CPD will be reduced in a linear manner, with the largest reduction in the 
VLNCCs + PF e -cig condition.  
Aim 2 (Secondary): To compare the effects of study conditions on measures of cigarette 
demand, smoke exposure (breath CO) and tobacco carcinogen biomarkers (NNAL, PAHs) in 
smokers  with OUD.  We hypothesize  that at Week  16, these  measures  will have  decreased  in a 
linear manner, with the largest reduction in the VLNCCs + PF e -cig condition.  
Aim 3 (Exploratory):  To explore  the effects  of the four study  conditions  on cigarette  demand,

 craving,  and withdrawal  in smokers  with OUD  during  the abstinence  assessment  period.  
The integrative theme of  this TCORS is vulnerable populations.  The proposed research 
is relevant to FDA CTP’s scientific domains of Addiction and Behavior by addressing whether 
reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes reduces cigarette use, dependence, and product 
appeal,  and whether  these  effects  are enhanced  by availability  of appealing  alternative  sources 
of non -combusted nicotine. It addresses the domain of Health Effects by assessing tobacco 
toxicant exposure and other biomarkers. The proposed study is significant and innovative by 
modeling the potential moderating effects of e -cigarette availability and appeal on a national 
reduced -nicotine  policy  for cigarettes  in this understudied  population.  Finally,  it is programmatic 
as it builds directly upon and extends the work our team accomplished during the Phase 1 
funding period  
 2. SIGNIFICANCE   
 
2.1. Opioid  Use Disorder  (OUD)  and smoking  
Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of US morbidity and mortality.1 While 
smoking  has steadily  declined  in the general  population,  it remains  entrenched  among  vulnerable 
populations. Individuals with substance use disorders, mental illness or socioeconomic 
disadvantage are disproportionately represented among current cigarette smokers and bear a 
disproportionate  burden  of smoking  attributable  disease  and premature  death.2-5 The focus  of this 
proposal is on the vulnerable population of smokers with concurrent substance abuse. Recent 
data from Wave 1 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health study show that among 
current adult cigarette smokers, 80.7% report past -year alcohol or drug use.6 Current smokers 
are more than twice as likely as non -smokers to report past -year misuse of painkillers/sedatives 
and more than four times as likely to be past -year users of other drugs, including heroin. 
Conversely, individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) are substantially more likely to die 
of tobacco -related  disorders  (e.g.,  lung and larynx  cancers,  respiratory  disease)  than the general 
population.7-9 They  are also more  likely  to die of problems  related  to their tobacco  use than other 
drug use.10 
As an exemplar of the larger population of smokers with SUDs, we have been focusing on 
those with concomitant opioid use disorder (OUD). The disproportionate burden of smoking and 
smoking -related  consequences  is especially  evident  in these  individuals.  Prevalence  of smoking  
among  adults  with OUD  is six-fold that of the general  US adult  population  (84-94% vs. 15%,  
respectively).11-17 Smokers with OUD also have greater severity of nicotine dependence. In 
recent analyses by our group of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2006 - 
2014), after accounting for sociodemographic and smoking characteristics, mean Nicotine 
Dependence  Syndrome  Scale  scores  were  significantly  higher  for opioid -dependent  smokers  vs. 
smokers not dependent on opioids (p<0.05).18 Finally, smoking is associated with significant 
morbidity  and mortality  in this population,  with the mortality  rate of opioid -dependent  smokers 
four times that of opioid -dependent nonsmokers .7,9-10 
The majority of OUD patients report knowledge of the adverse health consequences of 
smoking as well as a desire to quit smoking.12,16 -17,19 -23 Despite this, their responses to standard 
smoking  cessation  treatments,  including  standard  pharmacotherapies,  are notoriously  poor,  with 
quit rates one -fourth that of non -substance abusers.16, 24 -29 Taken together, the high smoking 
prevalence, poor treatment response, and public health costs associated with smoking among 
opioid -dependent individuals are of significant concern given the scope of the current opioid 
epidemic, with 5% of Americans - over 16 million people - reporting recent opioid abuse.30-31

 2.2. Reducing  the addiction  potential of  tobacco products  
One potential way to reduce smoking prevalence is to implement public policy mandating a 
reduction in cigarette nicotine content below the threshold necessary to establish and sustain 
nicotine  dependence.32 The 2009  Family  Smoking  Prevention  and Tobacco  Control  Act gave  the 
FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect public health, including limiting the 
nicotine content of cigarettes. Nicotine is the constituent in tobacco that drives repeated use, 
dependence, and eventually the chronic diseases and premature death that result from chronic 
smoke exposure. Thus, reductions in nicotine content may reduce smoking prevalence and 
related disease by disrupting initiation of smoking by new users and increasing cessation rates 
among current smokers.33-34 This approach could be particularly beneficial to subpopulations of 
smokers who have less success with currently available cessation treatments, such as people 
with OUD.35 Our work during the current funding period, reviewed below, indicates that smokers 
with OUD respond to reductions in the nicotine content of cigarettes with reductions in cigarette 
demand and other measures of addiction potential, although to a lesser extent than the other 
vulnerable smoker populations we have been examining (i.e., economically disadvantaged 
women, individuals with affective disorders (AD)). We anticipate that a combination of tobacco 
market conditions will be necessary to produce a maximal effect on combusted smoking in this 
population. In particular, we hypothesize that (1) making alternative sources of non -combusted 
nicotine (i.e., electronic cigarettes; e -cigs) available and (2) doing so under conditions that 
optimize their appeal (i.e., preferred flavoring) may enhance the ability of a national policy to 
reduce nicotine standards to decrease cigarette smoking, dependence, and related adverse 
health outcomes among smokers with OU D. 
 
2.3. Relevance  of the project  to the integrative  theme  and goals  of the TCORS  
The integrative theme of our UVM TCORS is vulnerable populations , and our goals are to 
model  the potential  effects  of tobacco  product  standards  on product  use in vulnerable  populations, 
with the goal of reducing the risks of product use, dependence, and related adverse health 
outcomes.  For the FDA to effectively  execute  its tobacco  regulatory  responsibilities,  it must  have 
sound  scientific  evidence  on how product  standards  impact  tobacco  use in populations  with high 
rates of tobacco dependence. Our goal is to provide the FDA with that evidence. This project is 
relevant to that goal because it will examine the effects of a reduced -nicotine standard for 
cigarettes, alone and combined with another FDA -regulated product (e -cigs) on measures of 
cigarette  use, demand,  dependence  and tobacco  toxicant  exposure  in this vulnerable  population.  
 
2.4. Relevance  to the scientific  domains  and priorities  of the FDA CTP 
The proposed research is highly relevant to the CTP’s scientific domains of Addiction and 
Behavior because it will address whether reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes reduces 
cigarette use, dependence, and product appeal, and whether these effects are enhanced by the 
availability  of appealing  alternative  sources  of non-combusted  nicotine.  It will address  the Health 
Effects  domain  by assessing  the effects  of these  conditions  on tobacco  toxicant  exposure  and a 
respiratory biomarker.  
 
2.5. How study outcomes will improve scientific knowledge related to the manufacture, 
distribution and marketing of tobacco products  
Outcomes will directly inform scientific knowledge concerning the manufacture of tobacco 
products by demonstrating whether a reduction in the maximum nicotine content of cigarettes to  
≤ 0.4 mg nicotine/g tobacco would reduce smoking in this vulnerable population. The outcomes 
will also indicate  whether  continuing  to allow  the sale of e-cigs in characterizing  flavors  improves 
the efficacy  of a reduced -nicotine  standard  for cigarettes  on smoking  reduction  in this population.

  3. RATIONALE   
 
3.1. Effects  of nicotine  reduction  in smokers  with OUD  
There is growing evidence to support the public health benefit of a nicotine reduction policy. 
Studies  in the general  smoker  population  have  demonstrated  that use of reduced  nicotine  content 
cigarettes decreases smoking rates, dependence and toxin exposure levels.33,36 -46 However, 
these  studies  were  conducted  with psychiatrically  and socioeconomically  stable,  healthy  smokers. 
While a national nicotine reduction policy may hold significant potential to reduce smoking 
prevalence and related adverse health outcomes, it is important to first understand whether 
vulnerable populations of smokers may respond differently than the general population.43,47  This 
includes the possibility that these subgroups respond to reduced nicotine content cigarettes 
(RNCCs)  with compensatory  smoking,  which  could  lead to increased  carcinogen  and other  toxin 
exposure, failure to use RNCCs altogether, or transition to use of other products (e.g., cigars) 
which would undermine the merit of this regulatory strategy.48,49 
Research  conducted  by our UVM  TCORS  provides  encouraging  evidence  that the beneficial 
effects  of very low nicotine  content  cigarettes  (VLNCCs)  may extend  to populations  that are highly 
vulnerable to tobacco addiction and its associated adverse health consequences. During the 
current funding period, we have been conducting two multi -site studies examining acute and 
extended exposure to RNCCs on the addiction potential of smoking. The initial acute exposure 
study  consisted  of three  parallel,  within -subject  laboratory  studies  in economically  disadvantaged 
women  of reproductive  age (n=56),  individuals  with OUD  (n=60),  and individuals  with AD (n=53).50 
Participants sampled NIDA -provided research cigarettes varying in  
nicotine content (15.8, 2.4, 1.3, 0.4mg/g) under double -blind 
conditions, with the highest dose representing nicotine content 
typical of commercial cigarettes. Following brief abstinence, 
participants completed 14 sessions comparing the relative 
reinforcing  effects  of the 6 possible  dose  pairs  in concurrent  choice 
procedures. We also assessed demand for each cigarette dose 
using the Cigarette Purchase Task (CPT), a behavioral economic 
task that models  hypothetical  demand  for cigarettes  under  varying 
prices.  Lastly,  we compared  cigarettes  on smoking  topography  and 
subjective effects.  
Results were collapsed across populations as similarities 
outnumbered  differences.  In concurrent  choice  testing,  participants 
chose the higher over the lower nicotine content cigarettes across 
each of the six dose pairs when available at the same low price, 
providing  strong  evidence  that reducing  nicotine  content  decreases 
the relative reinforcing effects (i.e., addiction potential) of smoking 
in a graded  dose -dependent  manner  (Figure  1, upper  panel).  
Importantly   in  terms   of  regulatory   implications,   we  also 
demonstrated that the robust preference for the high 15.8 mg/g control dose over the 0.4 mg/g 
dose  was reversed  in all three  populations  by incrementing  the response  effort  required  to obtain 
the high dose  while  keeping  the low dose  available  at the same  low response  requirement  (lower 
panel). This suggests that product preference is conditional on environmental context. Demand 
for cigarettes  on the CPT task also decreased  as an orderly  function  of nicotine  content  consistent 
with the differences  in relative  reinforcing  effects  seen  in the concurrent  choice  task.  Importantly, 
there was no evidence of compensatory smoking. This study provided a compelling 
demonstration that RNCCs reduce the addiction potential of cigarettes in populations highly 
vulnerable  to tobacco  addiction.  It is worth  noting,  however,  that we observed  greater  overall  
Figure  1. Concurrent  Choice  Testing

10  
 cigarette demand across doses in smokers with OUD vs. the other vulnerable populations 
examined in this study.  
Our second multi -site study is ongoing and on schedule to be completed as planned. The 
study uses a three parallel -groups design to investigate the effects of 12 -week exposure to 
RNCCs  (15.8,  2.4, and 0.4 mg/g).  Preliminary  results  on total cigarettes  per day (CPD)  are shown 
in Figure 2 for the individuals that have completed the study thus far. Presented are results for 
the 15.8 mg/g  control  (i.e., usual  brand  cigarette)  dose  and the VLNCC  0.4 mg/g  dose,  which  has 
the lowest  addiction  potential.  These  also represent  the two doses  that we are proposing  to study 
in this renewal. Thus far, there is no evidence of sustained compensatory smoking in any 
population receiving VLNCCs. CPD across the two doses separates over time in all three 
vulnerable smoker groups; however, it does so later and overall consumption is greater among 
smokers  with OUD.  Additionally,  the current  effect  size for differences  in CPD  at 12 weeks  among 
the disadvantaged  women  and smokers  with AD (Cohen’s  d=0.70  and 0.81,  respectively)  are 
larger than those seen 
in the opioid  dependent 
population (d=0.38) 
and consistent with 
those seen at 6 weeks 
in the general 
population of smokers 
(0.7951). Fagerstrom 
dependence scores at 
12 weeks are also sig - 
nificantly    decreased  
among  those  assigned  to VLNCCs  vs. the 15.8 mg/g  dose  in the disadvantaged  women  and those 
with AD but not in individuals with OUD. The overall greater cigarette demand and consumption 
exhibited by smokers with OUD serves as an important reminder of the especially persistent 
nature of smoking in this population.  
3.2. Increasing  appeal  of alternative  non-combusted  nicotine  sources  
These data provide promising initial evidence that smokers with concomitant other 
socioeconomic, substance use and psychiatric vulnerabilities will respond to RNCCs with 
subsequent  reductions  in cigarette  demand  and other  measures  of addiction  potential.  However, 
there is growing recognition of the critical importance of having appealing alternative non - 
combusted  nicotine  sources  readily  available  if the potential  of a reduced  nicotine  standards  policy 
for combusted products is going to be realized. In the words of Benowitz and colleagues, “ The 
RNCC and the emergence of non -combusted nicotine products like e -cigs should be viewed not 
as alternatives but as complementary components of regulatory interventions that could virtually 
end combusted tobacco use. ”52 Further, the primary conclusion of the 2014 Surgeon General’s 
Report noted that “ the promotion of noncombustible tobacco products is much more likely to 
provide  public  health  benefits  only in an environment  where  the appeal,  accessibility,  promotion, 
and use of cigarettes and other combusted products are being rapidly reduced. ”1 Our data also 
lead us to anticipate that smokers with OUD and perhaps other SUDs may persist in smoking 
even if cigarette nicotine content is reduced to very low levels. This further highlights the critical 
importance of having non -combusted alternative sources of nicotine readily available at 
reinforcing doses and in forms that enhance appeal. We know of only one report empirically 
examining  how the presence  of non-combusted  products  influences  use of VLNCCs  and that was 
an exploratory  study  of participants  selected  from the general  smoker  population.44 In that study, 
when individuals assigned to VLNCCs opted to also use a non -combusted product, they 
overwhelmingly chose e -cigs over other non -combusted options (i.e., snus, NRT). This is 
consistent with other research modeling the substitutability of non -combusted tobacco products

 for combusted cigarettes53 and serves as the rationale for us focusing on e -cigs in this renewal 
application.

E-cigs consist of a cartridge containing an e -liquid nicotine solution, propylene glycol (PG), 
vegetable glycerin (VG), flavoring, and other additives, which are heated with an atomizer that 
vaporizes the solution. First generation e -cigs resemble cigarettes and are disposable or 
rechargeable. Second generation products (and the product used in this study) often resemble 
pens and have refillable e -liquid reservoirs, while third generation devices have larger batteries, 
adjustable power delivery and replacement heating coils and wicks.54 Nicotine delivery from e - 
cigs can be comparable to those from cigarettes, depending on e -cig characteristics, nicotine 
content  and user topography.55-58 Toxin  and carcinogen  levels  appear  to be lower  than those  from 
cigarettes. Hecht et al.59 reported that former smokers who had switched to e -cigs had 59 -99% 
lower  levels  of 6 tobacco  toxicant  and carcinogen  metabolites  than ongoing  smokers,  comparable 
to reductions  seen  in smokers  who had switched  to nicotine  lozenges.42 Another  study  found  that 
NNAL, a metabolite of the tobacco carcinogen NNK, was reduced by 64% in smokers who had 
switched  to e-cigs for two weeks,  as was chest  tightness.60 Initial  data suggest  that e-cigs may be 
a promising  tool for supporting  transition  away  from combusted  cigarettes  in smokers  with OUD.61- 
64 In a recent  observational  study  with methadone - and buprenorphine -maintained  smokers,  99% 
were familiar with e -cigs, 73% had ever tried them, and 34% were currently using e -cigs.65 As in 
the general population, smokers with OUD  reported that  their reasons  for e-cig use  are primarily 
to quit or reduce smoking.65 
 
3.4. E-cig effects  on smoking  
E-cig use is associated with smoking reduction66-68 and possibly quitting. In a trial using 
second  generation  e-cigs, cigarette  abstinence  rates  were  34% after 8 weeks  and 21% 6 months 
later, with an overall 60% reduction in CPD.69 The only published study to our knowledge on the 
effects  of e-cigs in smokers  with OUD  was an uncontrolled,  6-week  pilot study  with 12 methadone - 
maintained smokers. E -cig use was associated with significant reductions in self -reported 
combusted cigarette use, few adverse effects, and excellent e -cig adherence (89%70). While e - 
cigs can reduce cigarette craving and nicotine withdrawal,55,69,71 -72 these effects are generally 
determined  by the extent  to which  e-cigs are used  by smokers;  in turn, determinants  of e-cig use 
include product appeal and reinforcing effects.73 
 
3.5. Importance  of e-cig flavors  
Over two -thirds of adult e -cig users use a flavored e -cig.5,74 Flavors have been shown to 
substantially enhance e -cig appeal and relative reinforcing effects75-76 and have been cited as a 
key feature affecting e -cig use among adults.5,77-78 Experimental studies show that flavors 
increase demand for e -cigs among cigarette smokers.79-80 Studies of e -cig users also highlight 
that flavors  play an important  role in their experience  of the product  as well as reducing  cigarette 
consumption and craving.81-84 Importantly, there is a higher prevalence of flavored tobacco use 
among smokers with SUDs relative to the general population.5,12,14  A growing literature also 
suggests  that opioid -dependent  individuals  may be especially  sensitive  to flavors,  as activation  of 
the mu-opioid  receptor  by opioid  administration  is associated  with increased  preference  for sweet 
flavors.85-90 These  data suggest  that combining  a non-combusted  nicotine  source  with a preferred, 
likely sweet, flavor may have substantial appeal and thus potential for reducing combusted 
cigarette use in OUD smokers.

 3.6 Products  to be tested  
Cigarettes  to be assessed  
The cigarettes to be used in this study were made under an NIH contract with production being 
overseen  by the Research  Triangle  Institute  (referred  to as “Spectrum  cigarettes”).  NIH currently 
has approximately 10 million of these cigarettes (of varying types) for research purposes.  The 
cigarettes selected for the study span the range of yields likely to produce the hypothesized 
effects, as described above.  Spectrum cigarettes are not currently commercially available, 
although  they are similar  in many  ways  to marketed  cigarettes  (e.g.,  similar  manufacturing,  filter, 
paper, etc.).  
 
E-cigarettes  to be assessed  
Both the JUUL and the Vuse Solo will be used and assessed in this study. . While JUUL will be 
offered to all participants, participants that are unwilling to use JUUL will be offered the Vuse Solo. 
JUUL is a commercially available closed system containing two components. One component 
contains a lithium -ion battery (200 mAh), nichrome coil heater, silica wick, and stainless steel 
vapor path. The other component is the prefilled e -liquid container that also serves as the 
mouthpiece. Each commercially available cartridge holds approximately 0.7 mL of e -liquid 
containing approximately 40 mg of nicotine or 5% nicotine by weight (NBW). A lower dose 
containing approximately 23 mg of nicotine per cartridge or 3% NBW is also marketed but will 
not be used  in this study.  All containers  contain  glycerol,  propylene  glycol,  natural  oils, extracts 
and flavors, nicotine, benzoic acid. We will not alter the e -liquid in any way. The research staff 
will distribute  the e-liquid  containers  as purchased  from the manufacturer.  The JUUL  apparatus 
and 5% NBW  e-liquids  that will be used  are legally  purchasable  and have  been  as of August  8, 
2016. We will not alter them in any way.  
Vuse Solo is a commercially available closed system containing two components. The 
power/heating  device  includes  a 270 mAh battery,  silica  wick,  microchips,  and sensor.  The other 
component is the prefilled e -liquid container. Each commercially available cartridge holds 
approximately 1 mL of liquid containing 48 mg of nicotine or 4.8% NBW. All containers contain 
vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, reverse -osmosis water, glycerin, flavorings, and nicotine.  
The research staff will distribute the e -liquid containers as purchased from the manufacturer. 
The Vuse  apparatus  and e-liquid  cartridges  that will be used  are legally  purchasable  and have 
been as of August 8, 2016. We will not alter them in any way.  
 
3.7. Summary  
Although  smoking  rates  have  declined  in the overall  US population,  there  has been  little to no 
decline  among  people  with OUD.  A nicotine  reduction  strategy  for combustible  tobacco  combined 
with e -cig availability may have complementary effects on smoking reductions and consequent 
tobacco -related health effects in this vulnerable population. This research is highly significant 
because  it will model  how the availability  of e-cigs impacts  the effectiveness  of a reduced -nicotine 
policy for cigarettes in vulnerable smokers. It is responsive to the goals of the FDA in that the 
study conditions are designed to model real -world scenarios of possible harm reduction policies 
in populations that are vulnerable to smoking persistence.  
 4. Project  Study  Methods   
 
This study will use a four -condition, parallel -groups research design. After a baseline period 
in which daily smoking rate and other baseline assessments are completed, participants will be 
randomly  assigned  to one of the following  four conditions  for a 16-week  experimental  period:  (1) 
normal nicotine content cigarettes (NNCCs, 15.8 mg/g) alone, which serves as the control 
condition; (2) very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNCCs, 0.4 mg/g) alone; (3) VLNCCs + 
tobacco -flavored nicotinized e -cigs (TF e -cig, 4.8 - 5.0% nicotine by weight, NBW, if they  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
13  
 choose  to use the Vuse  or JULL  devise,  respectively);  or (4) VLNCCs  + preferred -flavor 
nicotinized e -cigarette (PF e -cig). 
 
 5. Study  Screening  Procedures   
5.1. Participants  
Participants will be men and women, ages 21 -70, who are currently receiving methadone or 
buprenorphine maintenance for OUD. They must report smoking >5 cigs/day for the past year 
and provide a breath CO ≥ 8ppm or a positive urine cotinine value. They must be sufficiently 
literate to complete research tasks, be in good physical health without serious illness or change 
in health in the past 3 months, must not be daily e -cigarette users, and have the technological 
capabilities to complete weekly face -to-face video assessments and the compatibility to use ico 
Smartphone Smokerlyzers for assessing breath carbon monoxide (CO) levels.. As opioid and 
cocaine  use can directly  increase  smoking  rates,91-96 participants  must  be maintained  on a stable 
methadone or buprenorphine dose with no regular illicit -drug abuse (<4 positive specimens) for 
the past month. Consent to confirm dose and drug abstinence with the participant's opioid clinic 
will be obtained at intake, and we will monitor any changes in dose throughout the study. These 
practices  have  been  effective  for confirming  clinical  stability  in our prior smoking  trials  with opioid - 
maintained patients.50,96 -100 
We will exclude  those  <21 years  old as users  below  that age have  legal  restrictions  on ability 
to purchase these products that can alter use patterns for reasons that do not apply to adult 
populations. We will exclude pregnant and nursing women and women not reporting use of 
contraceptives, anyone currently using nicotine replacement, bupropion or other 
pharmacotherapies  as cessation  aids,  those  who report  daily use of e-cigs in the past 30 days  as 
they may not be compliant  with the study  e-cigs, and anyone  intending  to quit within  3 months,  as 
participation in this study may not reduce smoking and could increase smoke and/or nicotine 
exposure.  Those  who exclusively  use roll-your-own cigarettes  or used  other  non-cigarette  tobacco 
products (e.g., cigars, smokeless) ≥10 days in the last 30 are excluded as their use of these 
products  may reduce  the validity  of our main  outcome  measure,  total CPD  (which  includes  study 
and non-study  cigarettes).  The following  conditions  are excluded  as they could  affect  participants’ 
abilities  to complete  the study:  unstable  medical  or medication  conditions  (significant  changes  in 
a serious  medical  condition  in the past 3 months,  medication  changes  in the past 4 weeks;  details 
provided in Protection of Human Subjects  section), symptoms of psychosis or dementia, past - 
month suicidality, current (past -6 months) alcohol or SUDs other than nicotine and the OUD for 
which they are being treated, positive toxicology screen for illicit drugs (marijuana allowed; one 
re-screen  opportunity),  positive  breath  alcohol  level (BAL)  at screen  (one re-screen  opportunity). 
Participants  who meet  criteria  and provide  written  informed  consent  will be enrolled  into the trial. 
 
5.2. Recruitment  
This study will be conducted at the University of Vermont (UVM) in Burlington, VT 
(primary site) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Baltimore, MD. This collaboration will 
permit us to complete this study expeditiously, enhance sample diversity, and facilitate 
meaningful collaboration across multiple sites. Participants will be recruited through 
advertisements posted in local opioid treatment clinics, in local newspapers, on community 
bulletin boards, Craigslist, Facebook and word of mouth. Participants can choose to complete 
the pre -screening questionnaire online or by phone. At UVM, individuals recruited from online 
sources will be directed to a UVM -hosted recruitment website where they will have the 
opportunity  to select  which  research  studies  interest  them.  They  will then be redirected  to a brief 
online screener to assess eligibility. Those who contact us by phone will be given a description 
of the study  and asked  questions  to assess  eligibility.  The RA will read a script  briefly  explaining 
the study. Participants will be informed that this is not a smoking cessation program, and that  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
14  
 smoking cessation services are available in the community independent of their decision to 
participate  in this study.  If interested  and eligible,  participants  will be asked  to present  for a brief 
10-minute in -person medical consent visit where research staff obtain informed consent to 
contact participant’s opioid treatment provider to confirm stability in treatment. Participants will 
be asked to provide a urine sample for toxicology screening. If interested and eligible following 
the medical consent visit, they will be invited to participate in the first portion of the screening 
interview. Research assistants will inform eligible participants that the screening will occur over 
video  chat,  and will assist  the participant  with setting  up an appropriately  secure  video  platform.  
During this first portion of the screening, the participant will complete questionnaires 
through  REDCap  online  while  the research  assistant  is present  over video  chat or phone  to deliver 
instructions and to answer any questions. The participant will then answer interviewer - 
administered questionnaires over video chat. Participants who did not yet set up their video 
platforms  will do so with the research  assistant  before  beginning  any questionnaires.  Participants 
will be instructed  to have  picture  identification  (e.g. driver’s  license)  available  to show  the staff.  If 
participants anticipate not having acceptable ID, staff should consult with the project coordinator 
or study PI.  Initial study eligibility will be determined after data are collected from this visit. 
Participants who meet initial study eligibility will be scheduled for the second portion of the 
screening.  
Before the second portion of the screening occurs, eligible participants will receive the 
equipment  necessary  to use for collecting  physiological  measurements.  Participants  will be asked 
to pick up this equipment  via curbside  pickup  at our clinic  (UVM  University  Health  Center,  UHC), 
which  will consist  of participants  calling  staff once  they arrive  at UHC  and staff coming  out to give 
participants  a bag/box  containing  the following  equipment:  a Smokerlyzer;  an audio  jack adapter 
for the Smokerlyzer if necessary; a blood pressure cuff; an oximeter; a thermometer; a urinary 
cotinine dipstick; urine cups with attached temperature test strips; a pregnancy test strip (if 
applicable)  and urine  toxicology  test strips  or a saliva  toxicology  test. Participants  (and staff)  will 
be asked to use cloth face coverings when exchanging product.  Participants may be invited to 
come inside to pick up this equipment if the participant is asked to wait for this exchange. All 
participants must pass a COVID19 screening before entering the building. If there is any waiting 
that needs to occur inside the building, the participant will wait inside one of our five highly 
ventilated smoking chambers. If there happens to be no space in the smoking chambers, the 
participant will be told that they can not come up to the clinic until space is available. After each 
use, the all of the surfaces  in the smoking  chambers  will be cleaned  with 70% or greater  of alcohol 
solution by staff wearing a mask and gloves, as well as all of the door handles. If the participant 
uses the bathroom while they are in the clinic, the bathroom surfaces and handles will be wiped 
down  after use by staff while  masks  and gloves  are worn.  Participants  who are using  the smoking 
chambers at any point in the study to wait for product or equipment exchange will remain in the 
chambers until a staff member comes to knock on the door to let them out. In this way, we can 
avoid people coming into close contact with each other in the larger room that contains the 
smoking  chambers.  A minimum  of 6 feet of distance  will be maintained  for all staff and participants 
at all times. For participants who cannot come to the clinic, a commercial courier will deliver this 
equipment to them before the second portion of the screening.  
If at any point the Smokerlyzers are not available for distribution, we will conduct the CO 
test curbside before or after participants are invited inside and the courier service will not be 
available. Research Assistants will bring down the CO monitor to the participant. While 
maintaining 10 feet of distance and wearing gloves, staff will explain how the CO monitor works. 
Once the participant is ready, staff will press the button to obtain the measurement and will set 
the CO monitor down and will back away 10 feet. The participant will then come to pick up the 
device and will blow into the monitor. After the participant completes the test, they will set down 
the monitor  and back  up 10 feet and staff will retrieve  the monitor.  After  every  use, staff will wipe 
down  the CO monitor  with disinfectant  wipes  and hydrogen  peroxide  wipes.  When  using  the 
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
15  
 monitor,  a D-piece  (a portable  valve  filter)  must  be placed  into the monitor  and then the single  use 
plastic mouthpiece is placed into the D -piece. The monitor has built in SteriTouch technology to 
ensure optimum infection control, and the D -pieces filter out 99.9% of airborne bacteria and 
greater  than 97% of viruses  for excellent  infection  control.  Each  participant  will be assigned  their 
own D-piece  to use throughout  the study,  and no D-piece  will ever be shared  among  participants. 
Participants will gently exhale into the D -piece for the breath carbon monoxide reading. 
Participants  will be instructed  only to exhale  through  the device,  not to inhale.  D-piece  technology 
also includes  a one-way valve  that prevents  air from being  drawn  back  from the monitor.  D-pieces 
will also be wiped  down  after each  use with disinfectant  wipes  and hydrogen  peroxide  wipes  and 
stored in a container at the lab.  
Once participants have received the necessary equipment to complete the physiological 
portion  of the screening,  the research  assistant  will initiate  a video  call with the participant.  During 
this call, the participant will be instructed on how to use the equipment and then will be asked to 
use the equipment to obtain the following physiological readings: blood pressure, heart rate, 
oxygen  saturation,  temperature,  and breath  CO levels.  Participants  will also be asked  to collect  a 
urine or saliva sample during the visit. If a saliva sample is collected, the participant you will 
provide  the saliva  sample  over video  chat while  the staff observes.  If a urine  sample  is collected, 
staff will ask participant to bring this urine sample to the video screen after collection to perform 
a urine  toxicology  test and a pregnancy  test (if applicable).  These  urine  cups  will have  temperature 
strips affixed to ensure that the sample is valid. Participants who have a carbon monoxide level 
of less than or equal to 8 will also be asked to use the urinary cotinine dipstick to determine 
whether they are positive for cotinine. The participant will obtain the physiological readings and 
perform the tests and then will hold the results of the test up to the camera so that the research 
assistant can interpret and record the readings on REDCap,  
UVM participants will be primarily recruited from our university opioid program, The 
Chittenden Center (CC). Dr. Sigmon is the Director of this clinic, which currently has 1,000 
methadone - or buprenorphine -maintained patients. A survey of CC patients indicates that 88% 
currently smoke, which translates to approximately 880 smokers at our on -site clinic alone. 
Recruitment will also draw from patients receiving treatment at the office -based buprenorphine 
practices throughout the Burlington, VT community. JHU participants will be recruited primarily 
from two clinics located directly on the JHU Bayview Medical Center Campus: Addiction 
Treatment Services, a methadone clinic with 500 patients, and Comprehensive Care, a primary 
care clinic with 300 patients receiving buprenorphine. Should these resources be inadequate at 
any point in time, we will also recruit from two large community -based methadone programs in 
Baltimore with whom Dr. Stitzer has an on -going relationship as a PI of the NIDA Clinical Trials 
Network.  Taken  together,  our access  to opioid -maintained  smokers  is more  than adequate  to fulfill 
the recruitment needs of this project. Power estimations were based on the 15% dropout rate 
across populations in our current trials. Using an intent -to-treat approach, we require 75 
randomized in each condition (300 total) to test our primary aims.  
Participants will be also instructed to have handy a pack of their usual brand cigarettes, 
all prescription  medications  they are currently  taking  and identification  (example,  driver’s  license) 
during this second portion of the screening visit. If participants anticipate not having acceptable 
ID site staff should consult with the project coordinator or study PI.  
A participant must complete his/her two -part screening session within 90 days of 
completing  the pre-screening  questionnaire.  If the participant  is not able to complete  the two-part 
screening visit in that timeframe, he/she will need to complete the pre -screening questionnaire 
again.  
 
5.3. Informed  Consent  Process:  
Before beginning the informed consent process, potential participants will need to produce 
identification  as described  above.  The interviewer  will confirm  the age and identity  of the 
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
16  
 participant. If the participant is not between the ages of 21 and 70, he/she will be dismissed 
without payment. During the first portion of the screening session, study information will be 
presented and documentation of the participant’s informed consent via electronic signature on 
REDCap will be required prior to participating in the screening session. In order to ensure 
adequate informed consent, participants will be asked to read the first several lines aloud (to 
determine literacy) and will then be given ample time to read the consent document. If the 
interviewer suspects the participant is not literate, he or she will have them continue reading 
further  to confirm.  Inability  to read and comprehend  written  study  materials  will result  in ineligibility 
and the interviewer will inform the participant that they are not eligible. Only after the participant 
and the researcher are fully satisfied that the participant understands the purpose of the study, 
the confidentiality of the data, the procedures, the risks/benefits and his/her rights as a research 
participant will the consent form be signed and the participant undergo screening procedures.  
 
5.4. Screening Measures  
Those  who consent  will be screened  for eligibility  using  the following  measures:  
The following physiological measures will be collected and entered directly into REDCap 
by the interviewer:  
1) Expired breath carbon monoxide (CO)  levels will be assessed using a Smartphone 
Monitor (Covita - for remote collection) or a Bedfont CO monitor (for curbside collection), 
a reliable and valid measure of recent smoking.  
a. Urinary cotinine test strips  will be used to asses urinary cotinine levels if a 
participant's CO reading is less than or equal to 8 ppm.  
2) A urine or saliva toxicological screen  will be performed to assess the presence of illicit 
drugs including up to the following drugs: marijuana, cocaine, opiates, oxycodone, 
benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines, methadone, buprenorphine, 
methamphetamines, MDMA and PCP. Participants who fail the drug screen for drugs 
other than marijuana or their prescribed opioid medication may reschedule the interview 
but will need  to be re-consented  to ensure  they have  received  adequate  informed  consent. 
They will be excluded if they are positive for drugs (other than marijuana or prescribed 
medications as determined by PI on a case -by-case basis) the second time.  
3) Urine  Pregnancy  Test (HCG  detection)  will be performed  for all participants.  
4) Blood pressure and heart rate  will be measured using an automated blood pressure 
monitor and a finger pulse oximeter to help the licensed medical professional determine 
final participant  eligibility.  Participants  will be told if their blood  pressure  is in an abnormal 
range  and advised  to see a doctor  by research  staff.  The research  staff will also submit  a 
medical event form for the LMP to review along with a Blood Pressure and Heart Rate 
Symptom  Checklist  form to ascertain  details  of the symptomatology  for the LMP to review. 
In severe cases, the LMP may also choose to call the participant to follow -up and/or 
withdraw the participant from the study if necessary. All of these procedures are 
documented  in our Blood  Pressure/Heart  Rate  Collection:  Standard  Operating  Procedure 
form which we can submit to the IRB if the Committee deems necessary.  
5) Body  temperature,  respiratory  rate and oxygen  saturation  will be added  as physiological  
measures based on the CDC recommendations and those of Dr. David Kaminsky.

suicide attempt in the past 6 months) or answer “yes” to question A3g on the MINI 
Neuropsychiatric  interview  and symptoms  have  occurred  in the past two weeks  will be assessed 
by a clinician for eligibility and possible intervention. The research staff member will contact a 
licensed clinician for evaluation. In the event that no clinician is available, staff will put the 
participant in contact with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1 -800-273-8255. They will 
also contact  the Study  Coordinator  and Site PI to inform  them  of the situation  as soon  as possible. 
Additionally,  they will contact  the Project  Coordinator  to inform  her of the situation.  The participant 
will be paid $25 (+$25  bonus  if applicable)  and provided  with local mental  health  resources.  Post 
enrollment,  any report  of suicidal  ideation  or attempt  by a participant  will be grounds  for immediate 
withdrawal from the study.

23) Oxygen  saturation  of < 90% 
24) Reporting  positive  symptoms  for COVID19  
 
Individuals  under  age 21 are excluded  because  they cannot  legally  buy cigarettes.  Those  with 
unstable medical, psychiatric, or medication conditions (as determined by the licensed medical 
professional)  are excluded  as these  symptoms  could  affect  a participant’s  ability  to complete  the 
study. Examples include but are not limited to the following: angina, stroke, heart attack which 
occurred since phone screening, blood clots in the arms or legs for which the individual is 
undergoing  active  medical  treatment,  cancer  requiring  active  chemotherapy  or radiation  therapy, 
severe shortness of breath caused by conditions such as uncontrolled asthma, COPD, or 
arrhythmia, active untreated infection such as pneumonia, active untreated endocrine disorder 
such as hyperthyroidism. We will exclude those currently seeking smoking treatment and those 
who plan to quit in the next 30 days, as participation in this study may not lead to reductions in 
smoking. We will exclude pregnant or nursing women and women of reproductive potential who 
are unwilling  to use acceptable  forms  of birth control  throughout  the study  if applicable  determined 
by the Project  Medical  Director.  We will also exclude  anyone  with current  or recent  alcohol  or drug 
abuse problems as these factors could independently affect smoking behavior during the study. 
Individuals with baseline CO readings greater than 80 ppm, those with heart rate or blood 
pressure  readings  that are out of range  (systolic:  90-159 mmHg;  diastolic:  50-99 mmHg;  HR: 45- 
114 bpm)  and anyone  who has attempted  suicide  in the past six months  will be excluded  from the 
study for safety concerns.  Individuals who smoke ‘roll your own’ cigarettes exclusively will be 
excluded from the study because we will be unable to standardize their baseline smoking 
behavior. Individuals who have reported daily use of e -cigarettes in the past 30 days will be 
excluded  as they may not be compliant  with experimenter -provided  e-cigarettes.  Individuals  who 
have  recently  participated  in a research  study  will be excluded  as participation  may have  changed 
their smoking  patterns,  which  may preclude  a stable  smoking  baseline.  Because  participants  are 
required to complete portions of the protocol independently, they will need to be able to 
independently read and comprehend the study materials.  
 
5.7. Eligibility  Determination:  
The research  assistant  will review  the entire  screening  assessment  battery  for initial  eligibility 
determination, confirming the participant meets the above described inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
All eligibility criteria that are not related to physiological measurements will be assessed during 
the first portion of the screening visit, and all criteria related to physiological measurements will 
be determined during the second portion of the screening. The final eligibility of the participant 
will be determined by a licensed medical professional (MD, DO, NP, PA, Master’s prepared RN 
or CRN) at each site after reviewing the Medical History Questionnaire, BDI, Mini 
Neuropsychiatric Interview, and the MINI suicide subscale. The licensed medical professional 
may meet  with a participant  if available  and think  it necessary  for eligibility  determination.  He/she 
will sign off on eligibility prior to the first baseline visit. If the licensed medical professional 
determines the participant is not medically eligible to participate in the study, has current 
symptomatology  that would  interfere  with interpretation  of the data,  or is unlikely  to complete  the 
study he/she will inform the research assistants who will contact the participant prior to the first  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
21  
 baseline  visit. The licensed  medical  professional  will not need  to review  the medical  history  forms 
of participants who are ineligible for other, non -medical reasons.  
If a participant fails the urine or saliva toxicology screen due to a prescription medication 
he/she is taking, then he/she will not be automatically excluded. The interviewer will make note 
of this when he/she submits the forms to the licensed medical professional for final eligibility 
determination.  
Once  all the screening  procedures  have  been  completed,  researchers  will pay participants  
$25 (+$25 bonus if applicable) for their time as long as they pass the drug tests and meet the 
minimum requirements for carbon monoxide or urinary cotinine levels. Participants will be paid 
after the completion of the study visit. If participants are deemed ineligible at any point in the 
screening, the participant will be paid after determined ineligible. Marijuana will be tested for but 
will not be an exclusionary  criterion.  If a participant  does  not pass  the drug test but has a current, 
valid prescription that would explain the failed test he/she will not be automatically excluded and 
will still receive the visit payment. Participants who meet all other eligibility criteria, sans the 
medical criteria, will be scheduled for the first baseline visit.  
At the end of the screening session, the researcher will complete the End of Visit Evaluation 
Form. This will allow the researcher to make note of any problems encountered during the visit 
and to assess the truthfulness of the participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use.  
 
 6. Study  Baseline  Procedures   
 
This study will use a one -week, two -session baseline period to collect baseline individual 
difference measures and monitor daily usual -brand smoking behavior. At Baseline 1 or within 1 
business day of the Baseline 1 visit, participants will be provided their usual brand cigarettes to 
smoke,  equivalent  to 150%  of their daily smoking  rate. Participants  will be encouraged  to come  to 
the lab to pick up their usual  brand  cigarettes  after they complete  the questionnaires  and physio  for 
the BL1 visit.  Those  who cannot  come  to the lab will receive  product  via a commercial  courier.  A 
time line follow  back  (TLFB)  will be used  during  the period  between  Baseline  1 and Baseline  2 to 
assess  the daily cigarette  use for the first 7 days  the participant  has product.  The participant  must 
have received their UB cigarettes from the lab before the 7 -day assessment period starts, and 
Baseline 2 must occur at least 7 days after the participant receives their usual brand cigarettes 
from the lab. If the baseline period extends past seven days and if the participant has run out of 
product,  participants  will need  to purchase  their own usual  brand  cigarettes.  Use of a two session 
baseline  period  will ensure  stability  of daily smoking  reports,  reduce  reactivity  to the daily cigarette 
monitoring, and reduce participant burden. During the two baseline sessions, participants will 
complete subjective questionnaires. Each visit will last approximately two to four hours. At the 
end of each  baseline  session,  the researcher  will complete  the End of Visit Evaluation  Form  This 
will allow  the researcher  to make  note of any problems  encountered  during  the visit and to assess 
the truthfulness  of the participant  in regards  to self-report  of tobacco  use. Participants  will also be 
supplied  with saliva  test equipment  and urine  collection  equipment  during  the Baseline  1 product 
exchange so that they can collect saliva and first void urine samples during the Baseline 2 visit.  
For the Baseline 1 visit and all subsequent visits, the participant will be sent a REDCap link 
within 15 minutes of the start of the scheduled visit to complete all of the non -interviewer 
administered  questionnaires.  The participant  will complete  these  questionnaires  on their own but 
can have the research assistant present on a video call if they desire. Before beginning the 
physiological assessment portion of the visit over video call, the research assistant must review 
the participant’s  questionnaire  responses  for that visit. Participants  will be compensated  after the 
completion of the study visit and when the participant has received their new product.  
At Baseline  2 and all subsequent  visits,  after the participant  has answered  the questionnaires 
and has completed  the physiological  portion  of the visit over video  call, participants  will be asked  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
22  
 to come to the lab for a curbside exchange of product and biological samples. Participants will 
bring  in their used  and unused  product  from the previous  visit as well as a first-void urine  sample 
for assessing tobacco -related toxin exposure and a salivary sample for assessing nicotine 
metabolism rate on applicable visits (BL2, Week 8 and Week 16) using equipment that was 
provided  at the previous  visit. Participants  will be instructed  to call the RA at the office  when  they 
get to the clinic to ensure that there is enough space in the smoking chambers to house all 
participants while abiding by safety guidelines as detailed on page 14 of the protocol. All 
participants  must  pass  a COVID19  screening  before  entering  the building.  When  invited  into the 
lab, the participant will be shown to a smoking chamber and will instructed to place their bag of 
product  outside  of the chamber.  The participant  will wait here while  the RA processes  and returns 
product through the randomization database. Then the RA will dispense new product and bring 
the bag back  to the participant.  When  the RA deems  it safe for the participant  to exit the chamber, 
the RA will instruct the participant that they can leave. The RA will instruct the participant to 
observe social distancing measures during this exchange, providing clarification if necessary. If 
a participant forgets their first -void urine sample at the Baseline 2 visit, staff will ask participant 
to come  back to the clinic  with their first void urine  sample  before  exchange  of product  occurs.  If 
participant is unable to return to the clinic with their first void sample, staff can arrange to meet 
the participant  off campus  to pick up their urine  sample  and to give participant  their study  product. 
Distancing  and safety  measures  as described  above  must  be observed.  For participants  who cannot 
make  it to UHC,  special  arrangements  will be made  to enable  use of the randomization  database 
and product return/distribution procedures to the extent possible. Each week, during - or 
scheduled as nearly as possible to – a virtual visit, a complete accounting of the participant’s 
product  inventory  will be taken  and processed  remotely  through  the randomization  database.  The 
participant will separate product based on its type (e -cigarette or combustible inventory) and 
status (used/unused), and the RA will process return characteristics through the database 
accordingly. The RA will clarify barcode characteristics with the participant when legibility is 
compromised. The participant will be instructed to keep unused product in their possession, but 
to exchange any used product with the courier who will deliver newly dispensed replacement 
products within 48 hours.  
Product that will be given to participants for the Baseline 2 visit cannot be given/sent to 
participants  until 7 days  have  passed  following  completion  of the Baseline  1 visit. We will need  to 
calculate  baseline  smoking  rate during  this 7-day period  and so participants  cannot  have  access 
to any blinded study product or e -cigarettes before this 7 -day period has ended.  
 
6.1. Visit  scheduling  requirements  for baseline  period:  
Participants  will be required  to schedule  the Baseline  1 visit within  30 days  of the completion 
of their screening  visit. If a participant  still wants  to be in the study  after 30 days,  he/she  will need 
to be re -screened. The participant will need to be re -consented but will maintain the original 
REDCap Subject Identifier. The ideal target window separating Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 is 
between 7 and 12 days. The minimum is 7 days and the maximum is 21 days. If the participant 
does not complete the visit within 21 days, then he/she will not be rescheduled and will be 
discontinued from the study.  
6.2. Measures/Assessments  
The following  physiological  measures  will be collected  and recorded  directly  into REDCap

15)  Cigarette Purchase Task – Usual Brand Version (CPT)118, a self -report analogue of a 
progressive -ratio schedule  that measures  the relative  reinforcing  efficacy  of cigarettes  by 
querying  how many  of that day’s  cigarette  they would  consume  in a day at varying  prices. 
This task will indicate whether prolonged VLNC cigarette use reduces cigarette demand 
and increases sensitivity to increases in cigarette costs;  
 
All participants  will also be asked  to select  their  top three  flavors  of e-cigarette  liquid  from  a list read 
to them by the RA. This question will be asked in preparation for giving flavored pods to participants 
who  are randomized  into the flavored  e-cigarette  condition.  This information  will be recorded  directly 
into REDCap.  Participants  will be asked  to rate these  top three  flavors  based  on either  previous  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
24  
 experience with these flavors or to indicate how much they believe that they will like or dislike the 
flavors.

In the event  that the REDCap  website  is not functioning,  the assessments  will be administered 
aloud and participant answers will be recorded securely. The interviewer will enter the data into 
REDCap when it resumes functioning properly. This information should be recorded in the ‘End 
of Visit Evaluation Form’.  
 
6.3. E-cigarette  Training  Session  (Baseline  2): 
Participants  assigned  to an e-cig condition  will be told that they will be provided  with a 
JUUL. If a participant indicates an unwillingness to use the JUUL device, the research  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
25  
 assistants  will offer the participant  the Vuse  Solo as alternative  device.  If the participants  does 
not wish to use either device, he or she would be ineligible for the study.  
Participants in the e -cigarette conditions will be given e -cigarette pods BEFORE the training 
session occurs. These pods will be either picked up at the lab (preferred) or delivered to the 
participant 1 to 2 days before their Baseline 2 visit occurs. Participants randomized to the e - 
cigarette conditions will be notified before their Baseline 2 visit (but after the 7 -day period 
following Baseline 1) and informed of their e -cigarette condition. Participants randomized to the 
flavored  condition  will be given  pods  of up to three  flavors  of their choice.  Staff will calculate  how 
many total pods participants will be given at this time based on their smoking rate, and 
participants will be able to choose the proportion of each flavor that they would like to receive.  
The e -cigarette training session will occur over video chat after the physiological 
measurements  have  been  collected.  The first 30 minutes  of the training  session  will consist  the 
participant being taught how to use, charge, and replace pods. Participants will first try their 
JUUL using the tobacco flavor. At this point, participants who are in the tobacco -only flavor 
condition will conclude their training session.  
For all visits following Baseline 2, participants in the preferred flavor condition, participants 
are permitted  to take up to three  flavors  home  per week,  but can choose  to take less than three 
flavors if desired. Participants will take home their chosen pods or cartridges of up to three 
flavors.  Participants will be able to change their flavors at only one point in the study if they 
desire.  Participants will only  be allowed  to take home three flavors at one time. Participants will 
be given an E -cigarette instructional manual that reviews the e -cigarette training done at this 
visit. Participants will be encouraged to call with any device issues.  
 
 
6.4. Interactive  Voice  Response  System:  
At the end of the first baseline visit, participants will be trained to use the Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR) System, which will contact participants each day throughout the study and ask 
about  their smoking  behavior  as well as withdrawal  symptoms  the week  before  and after Baseline  
2. We will also review the IVR adherence incentive  program, which consists of $1 per call plus a 
$10 bonus  for seven  consecutive  calls.  
The IVR system  is operated  by TeleSage  (https://telesage.com/about/).  To be enrolled  in the 
IVR system,  research  staff will enter  the participant’s  initials,  telephone  number,  subject  identifier, 
and visit dates into the IVR TCORS website. Identifying information (initials and telephone 
numbers) will not be extracted as part of the data by the bioinformatics group. Please refer to 
TeleSage’s privacy statement and HIPAA compliance form for additional information.  
 
 
Baseline  2 biological  specimens:  
1) Urine  sample  for smoking  biomarker  assessment : 
Participants will be asked to provide a urine sample (first void of the day) at the second 
baseline session and to post -randomization weeks 8 and 16 for biomarker assessment. 
Biomarker  analysis  will provide  nicotine  and carcinogen  exposure  outcome  measures  and 
verify compliance with VLNC cigarettes. Samples will be stored at -80C. Urine samples 
will be analyzed  for total nicotine  (cotinine  plus its glucuronide  conjugate,  a useful  measure 
of daily nicotine exposure), the tobacco -specific nitrosamine 4 -methylnitrosamineo -1-(3- 
pyridyl) -1-butanol  (NNAL),  and metabolites  of 4 polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs), 
which are biomarkers of tobacco smoke carcinogens and decrease upon tobacco 
cessation or reduction. Anatabine is a minor alkaloid that is reduced in users of VLNC 
cigarettes and e -cigs. Therefore, anatabine levels in samples from those assigned to the 
VLNCC, VLNCC+TF e -cig and VLNCC+PF e -cig conditions should be lower than levels  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
26  
 from those in the NNCC condition. These analyses will be preformed by the Murphy lab 
at the University of Minnesota.  
2) Saliva  Samples  for smoking  biomarker  assessment:  
We will collect a saliva sample at the second baseline session and post -randomization 
weeks  8 and 16 for analysis  of nicotine  metabolite  ratio (NMR;  ratio of 3-hydroxycotininine 
[3 HC] to cotinine [COT]), a phenotypic marker of nicotine metabolic rate. Analyses of 
these samples will be performed by the Tyndale lab.  
 
Biomarker  shipping  and storage:  
Biomarkers will be shipped quarterly to the University of Vermont Laboratory for Clinical 
Biochemistry Research (Tracy Lab). The Tracy Lab will serve as a central repository for all 
biomarker specimens and will be responsible for distributing specimens to the appropriate labs 
on a quarterly basis. Urine samples will be analyzed and stored at the University of Minnesota 
Murphy  Lab. The saliva  samples  will be analyzed  and stored  at the University  of Toronto  Tyndale 
Lab. 
 
 
 7. Study  Experimental  Procedures   
7.1. Experimental Period:  
Participants  will be seen  weekly  throughout  the 16-week  experimental  period.  Weeks  4, 8, 12, 
16 and the abstinence visit will take approximately 2 -4 hours each. All other sessions will last 
approximately 2 hours. If a participant has a positive urine or saliva toxicology test or is visibly 
intoxicated as determined by slurred speech, swaying, or stumbling, the session will be 
rescheduled until a negative test result is obtained and intoxication is not present. As a part of 
each experimental visit, participants will be asked to come to UHC for a product exchange. All 
participants must pass a COVID19 screening before entering the building. Participants will be 
instructed  to contact  the RA at the office  when  they get to the clinic  to ensure  that there  is enough 
space in the smoking chambers to house all participants while abiding by safety guidelines as 
detailed on page 14 of the protocol. All participants must pass a COVID19 screening before 
entering the building. When invited into the lab, the participant will be shown to a smoking 
chamber  and will instructed  to place  their bag  of product  outside  of the chamber.  The participant 
will wait here while the RA processes and returns product through the randomization database. 
Then the RA will dispense new product and bring the bag back to the participant’s smoking 
chamber and leave it on the ground in front of the chamber. When the RA deems it safe for the 
participant  to exit the chamber,  the RA will instruct  the participant  that they can leave.  The RA will 
instruct the participant to observe social distancing measures during this exchange, providing 
clarification if necessary. At the end of each experimental session, the researcher will complete 
the End of Visit Evaluation Form, which will be filed in the participant’s binder. This will allow the 
researcher to make note of any problems encountered during the visit and to assess the 
truthfulness of the participant in regards to self -report of tobacco use and compliance to study 
procedures.  
 
Visit  scheduling  requirements  for experimental  period:  
The ideal scheduling window between each visit is 7 days based on the date of the Baseline 
2 Visit.  For additional  scheduling  requirements,  refer to the ‘Scheduling  Visits  SOP ’. If a participant 
misses a visit and is unable to reschedule during the window (± 3 days), that visit will not be 
‘made -up’ in the future. All measures that were not completed will be considered missing data 
and will not be collected  during  future  visits.  If a visit mistakenly  occurs  outside  of the designated 
window, this is a protocol deviation. A ‘Non -Medical Event Form’ will need to be completed. 
Additionally,  each  visit should  occur  at approximately  the same  time of day ± 1 hour.  The interval  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
27  
 between the time for the participant’s methadone/buprenorphine dose should also be consistent 
for each visit (± 1 hour).  
If a participant  is not able to attend  his/her  Week  16 visit, then it should  be rescheduled  even 
if it is outside of the scheduling window. This will be documented as a protocol deviation.

 7.4. Interactive  Voice  Response  System:  
Participants will continue to use the IVR system on a daily basis throughout the 
experimental period to record the number of study cigarettes smoked per day, measurement of 
e-cig use and use of non -study cigarettes or other tobacco products. Measurement of e -cig use 
will be collected by asking two questions: how many daily e -cigarette episodes occurred, where 
one episode consists of around 10 -15 puffs or up to approximately 10 minutes, and what 
proportion  of pods  and/or  cartridges  were  used  per day. Participants  will also be asked  to log how 
many flavors of e -cigs they used per day. During the first week after Baseline 1, the IVR system 
will collect information about mood and withdrawal symptoms.  
7.5. Variable  Incentive  Program:  
An incentive program has been developed with the goal of improving attendance at 
scheduled  assessment  sessions,  compliance  with using  only study -provided  tobacco  products, 
and encouraging honest self -reports regarding all nicotine/tobacco use.  
Briefly, participants will receive a total of seven tickets for each weekly visit they attend 
after randomization  (Visits  03-18, weeks  1-16). In total,  participants  could  earn 112 valid tickets 
across the 16 visits.  Participants will be instructed that these tickets correspond to attendance 
(one ticket), honest reporting (one ticket), compliance in bringing back used and unused 
pods/cartridges (two tickets)  and adherence to using only the assigned study product (three 
tickets). Participants who do not bring back all of their unused study product and used 
packaging will be told that they may not be eligible to earn the two compliance tickets.  
Participants  will be further  instructed that  all of  the tickets  that they  receive “could”  be eligible  for 
entry  into a monthly  drawing  for prizes,  but that only tickets  that are “validated”  will be eligible  for 
prizes.  
Since it is prohibitively expensive to test urine samples each week for each participant 
and because it is currently not feasible to detect with reasonable precision non -compliance 
based on biomarkers in the two higher nicotine group, we plan to only validate the attendance 
tickets.  Hence,  each  participant  who attends  their regularly  scheduled  weekly  session  will have 
a total of seven validated tickets entered into the monthly drawing.  
To convey the message that we may be validating honest reporting and use of only 
study -provided products, in a bogus pipeline of sorts, we will tell the participants that a 
composite assessment of the measures that we collect MAY be used to validate the amount of 
nicotine and tobacco products that they are using. So there is some minor deception involved, 
but technically we could conduct urine toxicology testing for both purposes. Hence, if the urine 
toxicology testing is presented as something that MAY  be done for validation purposes,  we feel 
that any deception is relatively minor. For scientific/economic reasons we are just electing to 
restrict validation to attendance. Nevertheless, we will debrief all participants upon the 
completion  of the trial. We will inform  them  that the incentive  program  was based  exclusively  on 
attendance due to the relatively high cost of urine toxicology testing and other practical 
problems with shipping the urines for prompt testing.  
Drawings will be conducted on the 1st of each month. Validation will be performed by 
staff who have no participant interaction and are not blind to condition. Any ticket drawn will be 
eligible  for an incentive  as the only true contingency  is for attendance.  There  will be no mention 
of the basis for earning incentives (i.e., whether the ticket was for attendance, honesty, 
adherence). Participants will simply be informed that he or she earned an incentive from the 
drawing.  
Each drawing will be independent (without replacement); consequently, some 
participants  will not win a prize  and others  may win more  than one during  the study  if more  than 
one of their tickets is drawn. After confirming winners, the remaining tickets from each month 
will be discarded  (i.e., tickets  will only be entered  into one drawing).  The monthly  prize  amounts  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
30  
 are detailed  below.  
We estimate based on the 2 ½ years we think it will take to complete this study, that 
participants  will win an average  of approximately  $65 in prizes  or an additional  $5.50  per week 
per participant.  
 
Grand Prize (1): $500 cash 
Second  Prize  (1): $200  cash 
Third Prize (5): $10 cash  
7.6. Product  and Procedures  Compliance  Review  Sessions:  
At each visit, Baseline 2 through Week 16, participants will be counseled about their use of 
the study  cigarettes  and assigned  e-cigarette  (if applicable).  Participants  will be asked  about  any 
concerns or obstacles associated with use of the study cigarettes and assigned e -cigarette (if 
applicable).  The importance  of honest  self-reporting  will be stressed.  Participants  will be told that 
they will not be penalized for use of other nicotine or tobacco products and that it is crucial for 
them  to report  any use of these  products.  If difficulties  are encountered,  participants  will be asked 
why they think they are experiencing difficulties (e.g., taste, withdrawal symptoms) and to 
problem -solve how to deal with these difficulties in order to meet the protocol requirements. 
Additionally, participants will be counseled about their IVR completion, visit attendance, task 
engagement and product accountability. Refer to the ‘ Product and Procedures Compliance 
Review Sessions SOP ’ for more information.  
7.7. Quit Attempts  During  the Study  Protocol:  
At each weekly session, we will ask each participant if s/he is currently abstaining from 
smoking with the intention of quitting and whether s/he is planning to quit smoking prior to 
his/her next scheduled visit. If a participant is currently abstaining from smoking with the 
intention to quit, we will encourage the participant to continue abstaining, schedule them for 
weekly visits, and provide them with NCI’s Clearing the Air manual and local smoking cessation 
resources.  We will give them  the option  of taking  study  product(s)  home  but not require  that they 
take them, and if they do take the product(s) home we will suggest that they put the product(s) 
away at home so as to remove these cues from view. We will ask the participant to contact staff 
if they lapse and would like to receive study product(s) prior to his/her next visit. If a participant  
is planning  to quit but has not initiated  a quit attempt,  we will ask if s/he has identified  a quit date 
and if so what the date is, provide them with the Clearing the Air manual and local smoking 
cessation resources, provide them with the study product(s), and recommend that they put the 
product(s) away out of view on the quit date.  
For those in a condition including e -cigarettes, we will defer to the participant’s interests 
in continuing to use e -cigarettes as part of their quit attempt. Those who indicate that they will 
continue to use them will be given their same weekly supplies base on their baseline smoking 
rate. Those who indicate that they are planning to abstain from both combusted and non - 
combusted  tobacco,  we will honor  that request.  As we state  above  about  combusted  cigarettes, 
if participant changes his or her mind about resuming e -cigarette use, they can contact us and 
obtain their weekly supply.  
 
 
7.7.A.  If a participant  is currently  abstaining  from  smoking  with the intention  to quit:  
• Encourage  participant  to continue  abstaining  from smoking  
• Schedule  the participant  for normal  weekly  visits  
• Provide  the participant  with the ‘Clearing  the Air ’ manual  and local smoking cessation 
resources  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
31  
 • Give the participant  the option  to receive  study  product  rather  than require  him/her  to take 
the product  
• If the participant choses to receive the study product have him/her sign a form 
acknowledging that cigarette availability could be detrimental to the quit attempt. 
Recommend that he/she put the product “away” at home as to avoid unwanted cues to 
smoke.  
• If the participant  chooses  not to receive  the study  product,  have  him/her  contact  the lab if 
he/she  lapses  and would  like to pick up or be mailed  the study  product  prior to his/her  next 
visit. 
7.7.B.  If a participant  is planning  to quit smoking,  but has not initiated  the quit attempt:  
• Ask if he/she  has identified  a target  quit date and, if so, what  that target  date is 
• Provide  the participant  with the ‘Clearing  the Air ’ manual  and local smoking cessation 
resources  
• Provide the participant with the study product as usual. Recommend that on the target  
date he/she put the product “away” at home as to avoid unwanted cues to smoke.  
 
7.8. Abstinence  Assessment  Session:  
After the week 16 visit, participants will be required to attend one additional visit the 
following day. During this visit, participants will have been encouraged to abstain from smoking 
until their next scheduled visit (approximately 24 hours later). The abstinence assessment 
session should be scheduled no less than 18 hours and no more than 30 hours after the Week 
16 visit. Abstinence will be verified by an expired breath carbon monoxide level of less than or 
equal to 6ppm. This session will allow us to determine whether the experimental cigarettes and 
e-cigarette use (for the e -cigarette conditions) have reduced the effects of abstinence on these 
measures  relative  to the control  conditions.  If the participant  does  NOT  meet  abstinence  criteria, 
he/she will only receive $20 for the visit.  Those who do meet abstinence criterion will do 
concurrent choice session detailed below.

 7.9. Participant Compensation:  
Participants will receive $25 for the medical consent visit. Participants will receive $25 
plus a $25 bonus for completing each screening visit, plus an additional $25 bonus for 
completing the visit on time as scheduled. Payment for the first screening session will be made 
upon its completion. Payment for the second session will be made regardless of enrollment as 
long as the participant passes the drug test and meets the minimum requirements for carbon 
monoxide or urinary cotinine levels. Participants who do not pass the drug test or who are  
visibly intoxicated as determined by slurred speech, swaying, or stumbling will not be able to 
complete the visit and will be asked to take another test several days after the first positive. If 
they are negative for the second test, they will be eligible to participate, and if they are positive 
the for the second text they will be excluded. Participants will receive $100 for each study visit 
from Baseline 1 to Week 16. Participants will also have a chance to earn an additional $20 
bonus for every study visit that is completed on time as scheduled starting at Week 1 and 
ending at Week 15. Participants can receive up to $120.00 for the abstinence session ($20 if 
participant does not achieve abstinence, $120 if participant reaches abstinence), $40 for 
biochemical verification of abstinence, and up to $306 for completing daily IVR reports of study 
cigarette and other nicotine and tobacco use.. There will also be a $150 bonus distributed at 
Week  16 for completing  the study.  Participants  who do not complete  the entire  study  will receive 
compensation for the sessions that they do complete. Total compensation for completing Study 
3, including study visit payments, daily IVR calls and end of study bonus is $2841. As  
mentioned above, participants will have a chance to earn additional incentives for compliance, 
honesty and attendance through urine testing. Participants will be given a debit card at the 
beginning of the study (during the second portion of the screening visit) and compensation for 
each  visit will be automatically  transferred  to the card after they complete  that visit. If debit  cards 
are unavailable, participants will be paid via an alternate method (i.e. cash or check).  
 
7.10.  End of Study:  
After  a participant  has completed  all study  procedures  and has been  paid for participation  the 
research assistant will read the following script and give the participant the Clearing the Air 
Manual.  
“If you’ve  reduced  your smoking  during  this study,  we encourage  you to continue  these  reductions 
or even consider quitting.  We would like to provide you with some resources should you decide 
to try to abstain from smoking (give “Clearing the Air” and hotline information).  Please also feel 
free to consult with your physician and use any medications he/she deems appropriate.  We will 
call you in approximately  30 days  to ask about  your smoking  since  leaving  the study.  There  is no 
right answer  and we know  how difficult  quitting  can be. Please  just answer  honestly.  The call will 
take less than 5 minutes. Thanks again for your participation.”  
The following  assessments  will be administered  using  REDCap:  
1) End of Study Questionnaire  
 
7.11.  30 Day Follow  up Phone  Call:  
Participants  will receive  a follow -up phone  call between  25 and 35 days  after the abstinence 
assessment session to assess their smoking patterns. The phone questionnaire will last less 
than five minutes. The questionnaire will ask if the participant is still smoking, how much and 
whether he/she has attempted to quit smoking since the end of the study. Participants will 
receive 5 variable incentive program lottery tickets for completing the call as compensation.  
Those who report abstinence will be invited to complete biochemical verification and be 
compensated  $40 for doing  so. Abstinence  will be achieved  by a carbon  monoxide  reading  of 6 
parts per million (ppm) or under. A urine sample may also be collected to be sent to the lab for  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
34  
 analysis. Additionally, any Medical Event Forms that remain open from the last session will be 
discussed.  If the participant became pregnant during the study, this would have been recorded 
as a medical  event.  During  this phone  call, the research  assistant  will confirm  her due date.  This 
event will remain open until delivery. At that time the licensed medical professional will contact 
the participant to ask  a few questions about  the baby’s health and will update the Medical Event 
Form.  
Once a participant has completed all study procedures and all open events have been 
closed,  the PI or Project  Manager  will review  the participant’s  record  and sign a form indicating 
study completion for that participant.  
 8.0 Study  Randomization   
 
8.1 Randomization  Process  
At the end of Baseline Session 2, participants will be randomized in equal probability to 
one of the four groups (NNCC, VLNCC, VLNCC + TF e -cig, VLNCC + PF e -cig) for a 16 -week 
period, with stratification by site and menthol cigarette status. Participants will be randomized, 
using  block  randomization,  in equal  number  to the dose  conditions,  with randomization  stratified 
by study  site and menthol  status.  Each  site will randomize  participants  until the total goal of 310 
participants across both sites is reached (205 at  UVM  and 105 at Johns Hopkins),  and no effort 
will be made to recruit a specific number of menthol and non -menthol smokers at each site.  
The lead statistician will create a randomization schedule for each of the two sites, 
amounting to 150% of expected enrollment at each site. The excess randomization codes will 
be used in the event that a site will have to enroll extra participants due to unexpectedly slow 
enrollment at another site. The nicotine doses will be identified by letter code and only 
Administrative Core personnel with no participant contact will have the link between the 
statistician’s letter code and dose assignments. There will be no blinding of e -cigarette 
conditions. The Administrative Core will maintain the randomization schedule and the link 
between  the alphabetic  code  and treatment  assignment  securely.  A second  sealed  copy  will be 
secured  in a separate  building  to protect  against  loss related  to fire or other  unforeseen  events.  
The University of Vermont will be responsible for removing all identifying information from 
cigarettes received from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI), labeling each carton with a blind 
code, assigning product using this blind code based on the randomization schedule being 
provided  by the UVM  Biostatistics  Core,  and shipping  cigarettes  and e-cigarettes  to each  site as 
needed based on recruitment.  Each site will be responsible for tracking product received and 
distributed to participants, collecting unused product from participants, and returning unused 
cigarettes and e -cigarettes  to UVM.  The participants, investigators and study staff will not have 
knowledge of which product is given to a participant or whether different participants received 
the same or different product.  
 
8.2 Study  Product  Administration  
During  the experimental  period,  participants  will be provided  with a 14-day supply  of research 
cigarettes equivalent to 150% of their daily smoking rate. Those in the e -cigarette conditions will 
also be provided with a 14 -day supply of e -cigarettes equivalent to their daily smoking rate. This 
rate will be calculated at Baseline 2 and will be an average daily smoking rate based on the IVR 
data that reports on the usage for the first seven days following the day of the first baseline visit. 
This will ensure adequate availability of cigarettes in the numerous locations participants may 
typically  keep  a supply  (home,  work,  vehicle,  etc.) as well as avoid  expending  the entire  supply  if 
they miss a scheduled visit.  Participants will be instructed to use the research cigarettes for 16 
weeks, at which point they are to discontinue product use.  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
35  
 If there  is prior knowledge  a participant  will be missing  a visit (i.e. planned  vacation,  laboratory 
closure,  etc.),  then the participant  will be provided  with an adequate  supply  of cigarettes  to make 
up for the missed visit(s). The participant will be given a 21 -day supply if one visit is going to be 
missed and a 28 -day supply if two visits are going to be missed.  
 
8.3 Guidelines  for Reporting  other  Nicotine  Product  Use 
Participants will be asked to refrain from use of other non -study cigarettes during the study 
period. If participants have to use another nicotine product, they will be told to use a non - 
combustible product (gum, patch, etc.).  Additionally, they will be told there is not a penalty for 
use of non -study products, and that it is crucial for them to report any use of non -study tobacco 
products. Throughout the baseline and experimental periods, an Interactive Voice Response 
(IVR)  system  will be used  on a daily basis  to record  the number  of study  cigarettes  and non-study 
cigarettes used the previous day. During the baseline and first experimental week, participants 
will also answer daily IVR questions about their mood.  Participants will be seen weekly for 
assessments.  Brief standardized review sessions focusing on compliance with the study 
cigarettes and other study procedures will be provided at each visit.  
 
8.4 Product Accountability:  
Participants  will be required  to keep  track  of all the products  provided  to them.  Therefore,  they 
will be instructed  to return  all unused  products  and empty  cigarette  packs  e-liquid  pods/cartridges 
to the laboratory  each  week.  Research  staff will complete  the ‘Product  Accountability  Log’ as they 
process participants’ product. Any discrepancies in the product dispensed versus product 
returned  will be discussed  and recorded  in the log. Research  staff will weigh  all opened  e-cigarette 
pods  /cartridges  that the participant  returns  at all visits  to determine  how much  e-liquid  was used 
since  the participant  was last seen.  Empty  cigarette  packs  and e-liquid  pods/cartridges  will not be 
saved. Unused cigarette packs and e -liquid pods/cartridges will be re -distributed to the 
participants during Weeks 1 -15. During Week 16, remaining unused cigarettes and e -cigarette 
pods/cartridges returned by the participants will be collected by the research staff.  
Participants who report running out of cigarettes or e -liquid pods/cartridges prior to a 
scheduled weekly visit will be allowed to come in for an unscheduled visit to obtain more 
research cigarettes. To determine whether a rate change for cigarettes is necessary, we will 
look at the past two CO levels as compared to the Baseline 2 CO. If the CO trend is consistent 
with the self -report of smoking all of the allotted cigarettes then a rate increase will be granted. 
The participant will then receive cigarettes at a rate of 175% of their daily smoking rate. The 
maximum  increase  is 200%  of their daily smoking  rate. To determine  whether  a rate change  for 
e-cigarettes is necessary, we will monitor the amount of e -cigarette use the participant is 
reporting and showing through product return along with any unscheduled visits. The 
investigator may grant an e -cigarette rate increase in increments of 25%. The maximum 
increase for e -cigarettes will be 200% of their baseline weekly e -cigarette dispensation rate.  
If participants  lose more  than two packs  of cigarettes  and/or  pods/cartridges  and require 
an unscheduled visit  to the laboratory to supplement  their supply, they will be told the next  time 
they lose more than two packs they will have to wait until their next scheduled appointment to 
receive more cigarettes.  
 
 
 9. Study  3 Statistical  Methods  and Sample  Size  
 
9.1 Statistical Methods  
Continuous outcomes will be summarized by mean, standard deviation, median and range. 
Categorical outcomes will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. Skewed continuous 
outcomes  will be log- or square -root transformed  as appropriate.  Variables  measured  at each  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
36  
 baseline visit will be averaged and the average will be used as the baseline measurement.. As 
we expect  conditions  to be balanced  on important  baseline  characteristics  due to randomization, 
our primary analysis for all endpoints will not be adjusted for potential confounders. However, a 
secondary analysis will be completed for all outcomes adjusting for demographic characteristics 
(e.g., age), that we have found to be important in prior studies. Potential moderators (e.g., SSRI 
vs. non -SSRI antidepressant, depression vs. anxiety disorders, BMI above or below 30) will be 
explored  by adding  that term and the moderator -by-condition  term to the model.  We will examine 
age group and gender as potential moderators in a similar fashion.  
Participants will be randomized in equal probability to one of the four conditions, with 
randomization stratified by site and menthol cigarette status. All analyses will follow the intent - 
to-treat principle  (i.e. subjects  will be analyzed  according  to condition  assignment,  regardless  of 
compliance). The Primary Aim will examine the effects of  condition on total CPD (study  product 
and non -study product). CPD will be analyzed by week (mean over all days in a seven -day 
period) using a mixed model to account for repeated measures from the same individual.  
Models  will include  baseline  CPD  as a covariate.  Using  a mixed  model  also allows  us to include 
the effect of study site as a random effect. Additional analyses conducted using data collected 
at the end of the study will use  orthogonal comparisons to test for  a linear trend in the decrease 
in CPD, such that VLNCC + PF e -cig > VLNCC + TO e -cig > VLNCC > NNCC, with the largest 
reduction in the VLNCC + PF e -cig condition. As we expect that differences among conditions for 
some of the outcomes may not follow a linear pattern , we will use related planned comparisons to 
test for threshold effects, specifically contrasting the NNCC condition to all three VLNCC 
conditions, and NNCC to the two VLNC + e -cigarette conditions. Analysis of cigarette demand, 
smoke exposure and tobacco carcinogens (Aim 2) as well as additional outcomes, including 
subjective effects, will be analyzed in a similar manner. Because Exploratory Aim 3 is based on 
abstinence -induced effects and will be examined using data collected at a single visit at Week 
17, analysis will be based on an analysis of co -variance model. In addition to the effect of 
condition, we will include important covariates noted above. Exploratory analyses will also be 
conducted combining data collected from three of the vulnerable populations (disadvantaged 
women of childbearing age, opioid dependent individuals, individuals with AD) to explore 
potential differences in effects of study condition across these populations. This will be done 
with the addition of the effects of population and population -by-condition terms to the models 
described above. Study staff will make every effort to minimize missing data, and results of our 
ongoing  trial suggest  that this will be minimal.  We will examine  the missing  data pattern,  and if it 
is missing at random, will use all data available, without imputation.  
 
9.2. Sample  Size 
Sample  size was determined  using  NQuery  Advisor  based  on hypothesis  tests  related  to 
Aim 1 to detect a significant difference between conditions on total CPD. The primary statistical 
approach will be repeated measures ANOVAs but required sample sizes were calculated 
focusing on expected outcomes at Week 16. This estimate is  
intentionally conservative and calculated based on one 
outcome at one time point; however, given the repeated 
measures nature of our data, we will have correlated 
observations  within  subjects  and thus will achieve  the stated 
power to detect differences of even lesser magnitude.  
Estimates are based on preliminary results from our current 
trial and from the Donny  et al.41 study  of VLNCCs  and NNCCs. 
The between -group effect size is defined as the difference of 
study condition means divided by the common standard 
deviation. A sample size of 75 participants per condition will  
provide  80% power  to detect  an effect  size of 0.50 for all pair-wise comparisons,  with a two- 

CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
37  
 sided type 1 error rate of 0.05. While this is larger than the effect size in our ongoing trial, we 
assume that the addition of e -cigs to the VLNCCs will decrease CPD from that seen with 
VLNCCs alone. Thus, while we recognize that we may have insufficient power to detect 
differences between the VLNCC and NNCC alone conditions, we expect a larger effect size 
when  comparing  the NNCC  and either  of the VLNCC  + e-cig conditions.  This sample  size also 
provides greater than 95% power to detect a linear dose -response effect across conditions.  
Because we have relied only on outcomes at Week 16, our proposed sample sizes are 
somewhat conservative, but we believe this is appropriate given that the effects of VLNCCs in 
this population,  particularly  in combination  with e-cigs, are unknown.  The sample  size assumes 
a 15% loss to follow -up, consistent with our experience in the current study. We will increase 
our overall sample size to 310 in order to allow pilot testing with 10 participants..  
 
 10. Potential  Risks  of Participation   
 
10.1 Risks  of Participation  
1) Survey Questionnaires.  Surveys include questions about participants’ medical and 
psychiatric histories, drug and alcohol use and history, breath tests for cigarette and 
alcohol  use, urine  or salivary  tests  of illicit drug use and pregnancy,  and questionnaires 
about your mood.  Answering these personal questions can make participants 
uncomfortable. If a participant reports thoughts of killing themselves or other indicators 
of suicidality, a study clinician will come to talk to the participant. The participant may 
also request to see a study clinician if he or she is in discomfort and would like help 
and/or referrals for mental health resources.  
 
2) Breach  of Confidentiality : The risk of the interview  is loss of privacy  if other  people  find out 
the results.  
 
3) Undue Influence : Undue influence is a possible risk due to monetary compensation for 
participating  in these  studies.  The likelihood  of this risk is low because  the compensation 
is commensurate with the amount of time and effort required for these studies.  
 
4) Drug Testing : A breach of confidentiality could occur and other people could learn of the 
participant’s drug use.  
 
5) Obtaining Blood Pressure and Heart Rate.  The blood pressure cuff may cause minimal 
discomfort.  In obtaining blood pressure we may find a participant to have abnormal 
blood pressure and/or heart rate. If participant’s blood pressure is abnormal, we will 
inform the participant of this, and participant may be advised to see a doctor, and may 
also be contacted by our study doctor. Also, smoking and nicotine can affect the 
cardiovascular  system,  which  may result  in changes  in blood  pressure  and/or  heart  rate. 
 
6) Smoking Cigarettes : All cigarettes are detrimental to a person’s health and can lead to 
significant medical problems including:  
a. Cardiovascular  Diseases:  Coronary  heart  disease,  heart  attack,  stroke,  peripheral 
vascular disease, reduced blood circulation, abdominal aortic aneurysm  
b. Respiratory  Diseases:  Emphysema,  bronchitis,  and chronic  airway  obstruction  
c. Cancers:  Cancer of the lung, bladder, cervix, esophagus, kidney, larynx, mouth, 
pancreas, throat, and stomach; leukemia  
d. Metabolic  Diseases:  Type  2 Diabetes  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
38  
 e. Other  Health  Risks  Associated  with Smoking:  Including  but not limited  to infertility, 
lower bone density in postmenopausal women, and hip fracture in women  
f. Death  
 
7) Smoking Study Cigarettes.  All cigarettes are harmful to a person's health and can lead 
to cardiovascular (heart) disease, respiratory (lung) disease, cancer and other health 
problems. In addition to the above medical problems, participants may experience some 
minor negative health effects such as headaches. Participants may also experience 
smoking withdrawal symptoms, which are listed below.  In addition, due to the altered 
nicotine levels, there could be a change in a participant’s use of cigarettes including the 
manner in which he or she inhales the smoke.  Smoking the study cigarette does not 
necessarily  provide  any less risk than the participant’s  usual  brand  of cigarette  and could 
pose increased health risks.  
 
8) Using Study E -cigarettes . E-cigarettes are devices that heat nicotine to produce an 
aerosol. The health effects of e -cigarettes are still unclear, but appear to be less than 
that for tobacco cigarettes. Most e -cigarette users have lower nicotine levels than when 
they smoked regular cigarettes.  Some e -cigarette users, especially those who use both 
e-cigarettes and regular tobacco cigarettes as well as youth and young adults, can have 
increased nicotine levels. In some rare cases, these use patterns have been associated 
with seizures. Whether this would occur with the concurrent use of very low nicotine 
cigarettes is unclear.  E-cigarettes users very often maintain addiction to nicotine, but 
this addiction appears to be somewhat less than that from tobacco cigarettes.  Abruptly 
quitting e -cigarettes could cause withdrawal symptoms similar to those from quitting 
tobacco cigarettes (see below) but slightly less severe. The most common side effects 
include dry mouth, irritation of the throat and mouth, and mild cough.  The JUUL and 
Vuse e -cigarettes we will be providing have not been well -studied but appear to be of 
similar risk to other e -cigarettes. Participants may have heard that e -cigarettes, or 
"vapes," can explode and seriously injure people. Study staff should instruct participants 
that although they appear rare, these explosions are dangerous. The exact causes of 
these  incidents  are not yet clear,  but some  evidence  suggests  that battery -related  issues 
may lead to vape explosions.  In order to prevent e -cigarette related injuries, instruct 
participants to keep their e -cig away from other metal objects, never charge the e -cig 
with a phone or tablet charger, don’t charge the e -cig overnight or leave it charging 
unattended, and to stop using the e -cig if the batteries get damaged or wet. The 
participant will be instructed to always keep e -cig liquid out of kids’ and pets’ reach and 
sight after use . If the study staff learns about additional risks of e -cigarettes during the 
study, participants will be informed of these risks.  
 
9) Mood and Psychiatric Symptom Changes.  Participants may experience smoking 
withdrawal symptoms during this study.  These symptoms can include anger, 
anxiousness, craving for a cigarette, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, 
frustration, increased appetite, impatience/impulsivity, irritability, restlessness, sleep 
problems, and weight gain. These feelings can be uncomfortable and can last a couple 
of weeks, but usually are of minimal risk.  In addition, if participants have a past history 
of anxiety, depression, or alcoholism, it is possible withdrawal could cause substantial 
increases  in depression  and anxiety  symptoms,  but this appears  to be rare. At each  visit, 
study staff will ask participants how they feel. If either study staff or the participant thinks 
that being in this study is putting the participant’s mental health at risk, staff may have 
the participant meet with an on -site clinician and/or stop participating in the study.  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
39  
 Further,  if a participant  report  thoughts  of killing  oneself  or other  indicators  of suicidality, 
a study  clinician  will come  to talk to the participant.  Participants  may also request  to see 
a study clinician if he or she is in discomfort and would like help and/or referrals for 
mental health resources.  
 
10) Returning to Regular Smoking:  It is possible that if participants return to smoking their 
usual brand of cigarette at the end of the study they may experience mild and transient 
nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness.  
 
25) Risk to Fetus.  To avoid risks to a fetus, it is important that participants are not pregnant 
during this study.  Avoiding sexual activity is the only certain method to prevent 
pregnancy.  However, if participants choose to be sexually active, participants should be 
using approved forms of birth control if applicable determined by the Project Medical 
Director, including but not limited to prescribed birth control pills, patch, ring, 
injections, implants or intrauterine device (IUD) or an appropriate “double barrier” 
method..  If you choose  to be sexually  active  during  this study,  pregnancy  could  still 
result even with the use of these birth control methods.  
 
10.2 Avoiding  Risks  to Fetus:  
If participants  choose  to be sexually  active,  they should  use an appropriate  “double  barrier” 
method  of birth control  (such  as female  use of a diaphragm,  or contraceptive  sponge,  in addition 
to male  use of a condom)  or the female  should  be using  prescribed  “birth  control”  pills, patch,  ring, 
injections, implants or intrauterine device (IUD) if applicable determined by the Project Medical 
Director. If a participant endorses a “double barrier” method, our medical professional will speak 
to the participant to confirm which methods will be used during the duration of the study. 
Participants  will be tested  for pregnancy  every  two weeks  beginning  at screening  through  the last 
study visit. If a participant becomes pregnant during the study, she will be withdrawn from the 
study.  Approximately 30 days after being withdrawn or having a positive pregnancy test at the 
last study visit, the research staff will call the participant to confirm her due date.  The licensed 
medical professional will follow -up with the participant after delivery to ask questions about the 
baby’s health.  
 
10.3 Expected  benefits  of participation:  
There are no benefits from participating in the study.  The information obtained from this 
study  may ultimately  help the Food  and Drug  Administration  decide  how best to regulate  nicotine 
and tobacco products with the goal of improving public health.  
 
 11. Protection Against  Risk  
 
11.1 Data  Collection  Protections  
Research data without identifiers will be maintained in a locked file cabinet and on 
password -protected computers in the research staff workplace, with only code numbers 
identifying  subjects.  Study  consent  forms  and the linkage  between  the participants’  names  and 
codes will be stored in a locked file cabinet inside a locked office. Interviews with participants 
will be conducted in private rooms.  Urine or saliva samples for drug and pregnancy tests and 
tobacco  exposure  biomarkers  will be obtained  in a private  bathroom  within  the laboratory  suite.  
Subjective  measures  will be administered  electronically.  The biostatistics  and data-management  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
40  
 team will provide consistent data -management practices for all data in the Center. Using 
REDCap, which is housed on the University of Vermont Medical Center’s HIPAA -compliant 
computing system,  will maximize validity and reliability of data. REDCap is a secure,  web-based 
system that accommodates local and remote data collection by each project team, and allows 
for data entry work -flow monitoring and data quality control monitoring by biometry staff. The 
RedCap database for this project will be hosted on the UVMCOM servers.  In addition, data will 
be collected from participants on a daily basis using an interactive voice recognition system 
(IVR)  developed  and hosted  by TeleSage  Inc (www.telesage.com , Chapel  Hill, NC). TeleSage  is 
a company  with expertise  on gathering  patient -centered  outcomes  tracking  data for 
mental  health  clinical  and research  institutions.  TeleSage  has developed  and hosted 
behavioral health -related  research software systems using  IVR and Web -based  
technologies  and is leader  in behavioral  health  outcomes  tracking  technologies.  For 
data integrity,  data entry windows will follow the structure of paper forms as much as possible to 
allow for ease of entry, and will use predefined choices to minimize errors when possible. Data 
quality monitoring will be facilitated with periodic down loads and analysis using a variety of 
common statistical program format such as SAS, Stata, R, and SPSS. Quality control 
procedures will be conducted for all data collected, including analysis of missing data and logic 
checks for out of range and other anomalous values.  This secure electronic data gathering and 
transmission plan, overseen by the experienced biostatistical team, will minimize opportunities 
for breaches of confidentiality. Biological samples for nicotine and carcinogen biomarker 
analysis will be marked with participant ID, stored in the locked laboratory suite, and sent to a 
laboratory for analysis on a quarterly basis.  
All information collected as part of this study will be accessible only to research staff. No 
information will be shared with participants’ clinicians unless the participant requests this in 
writing. All investigators and staff have undergone (and any new staff will undergo) human 
subjects’ ethics training as required by UVM and are fully conversant with relevant ethical 
principals  around  confidentiality.  Assessments,  consenting  and study  procedures  will be closely 
supervised by the PI.  
The sponsors (NIDA/FDA) as well as the Institutional Review Board and regulatory 
authorities could be granted direct access to original medical and research records for 
verification of clinical trial procedures and/or data.  If this is required, it will be done under 
conditions  that will protect  privacy  to the fullest  extent  possible  consistent  with laws relating  to 
public disclosure of information and the law -enforcement responsibilities of the agency.  
11.2 Data  Storage:  
Data  will be stored  locally  at each  site. Long -term storage  of all study  data,  for at least  7 years 
after study completion, will be at the University of Vermont.  
 
 12. Adverse  Events   
 
The research assistant will ask about adverse events at each session, using a form that 
assesses the nature, severity, duration, action taken, and outcome of study -related adverse 
events. AEs will be captured from the time of first study cigarette. Participants will be given 
contact cards to inform us of events that occur between study contacts. Any AE that remains 
open will be reviewed and closed at an interview conducted 30 days after the study completion 
date (completers)  or when  the study  should  have  ended  had the participant  completed  the study 
(dropouts and those withdrawn by investigator).  
All procedures  will be monitored  to ensure  that they conform  to the approved  protocol.  In 
addition, monitoring will be done of all unforeseen circumstances that might arise and affect 
safety; of all reports of serious adverse events as defined in 38 CFR 46 (death, new or 
prolonged hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity); of other significant  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
41  
 adverse events (adverse events that lead to drop out by the participant or termination by the 
investigator);  of unexpected  adverse  events  resulting  from the study,  and of expected  adverse 
events.  
Any SAE will be brought to the attention of the site PIs as soon as possible and not longer 
than 24 hours. Any AE or SAE that is both unexpected and related to study participation will be 
reported to the IRB within 7 days of the event. The local IRB will make a determination as to 
whether additional reporting requirements are needed. IRB actions will be reported to the 
funding agency by the PIs no less than annually and more frequently as recommended by the 
local IRB. Any SAEs will be summarized in the yearly Progress Reports to the funding agency, 
including a review of frequency and severity. All SAEs will be followed through ongoing 
consultation with the physician caring for the patient until they resolve, result in death, or 
stabilize and are not expected to improve. The study staff will be in close contact with 
participants  and health  care providers  throughout  the study  to monitor  for potential  unanticipated 
problems. Any unanticipated problems will be discussed at the weekly research staff meetings 
and reported as required to the local IRB.  
 
 
 13. Withdrawal  or Monitoring  of Participants   
 
For the participant’s  protection,  participants  will be withdrawn  immediately  from  the study 
if any of the following occur:  
1) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) event : Typically include s MI (heart attack), PTCA 
(angioplasty/stenting), bypass surgery, stroke, peripheral vascular disease (arterial 
blockages  in arms  or legs leading  to procedure  or surgery).  Less  common  CVD  problems 
would be new cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., new atrial fibrillation) or new valvular disease 
(e.g., mitral or aortic regurgitation).  
2) DVT/PE  (deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, i.e., blood clots in the venous 
system).  
3) Suicide Attempt : A participant will be withdrawn if he/she attempts suicide at any time 
during participation in the study.  
4) Psychiatric Hospitalization : A participant will be withdrawn if he/she is hospitalized for 
psychiatric reasons at any time during participation in the study.  
5) Pregnancy : If participant  indicates  she is pregnant  or has a positive  pregnancy  test at any 
time during the study, she will be withdrawn from the study, and this event will remain 
open until delivery.  At that time the licensed medical professional will contact the 
participant to ask a few questions about the baby’s health and will update the open 
‘Medical Event Form’.  A positive pregnancy test at Week 16 will trigger a ‘Medical Event 
Form’ to be completed but will not result in withdrawal since she is no longer receiving 
study product.  
6) Expired breath carbon monoxide increase : A participant will be withdrawn from the study 
if the average  of two consecutive  CO readings  during  the same  visit is 100 ppm or greater.  
7) Marked  increase  in smoking : A participant  will be withdrawn  from the study  if he/she  meets  
BOTH  of the following  criteria  for two consecutive  weeks  
a. Cigarette  per day increase:  The average  CPD  increases  by more  than 100%  from 
the average CPD during baseline.  
b. Expired breath carbon monoxide increase: If the average of two consecutive CO 
measurements in the same visit is  
i. CO is greater  than 50 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is <20 ppm.  
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
42  
 ii. CO is greater  than 60 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 20 – 34 ppm.  
iii. CO is greater  than 70  ppm if CO at  Baseline  1 is 35  – 49 ppm.  
iv. CO is greater  than 80  ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 50  – 64 ppm.  
v. CO is greater  than 90 ppm if CO at  Baseline  1 is 65 – 80 ppm.  
c. Note:  If the second  consecutive  visit is the last study  visit, then the participant 
would not be withdrawn from the study.  
 
8) If a participant  is discharged  from or discontinues  his or her methadone  or buprenorphine  
treatment , they will be discontinued from the study.  
 
The following will be monitored and can lead to the participant being withdrawn by the PI 
or Licensed Medical Professional:  
1) Cigarettes  per day increase : Continued  participation  will be evaluated  by the site PI if the 
average number of cigarettes per day (CPD) increases by more than 100% from the 
average CPD during baseline as determined by CPD at Baseline 2.  
2) Blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) changes : If any of the following occur post - 
enrollment:  1) BP is at or above  160/100  or below  90/50,  or 2) HR is at or above  115 bpm 
or below  45 bpm a manual  blood  pressure  and heart  rate measurement  will be taken  after 
10 minutes  have  passed.  If the manual  reading  is still out of range,  a ‘Blood  Pressure  and 
Heart Rate Symptom Checklist’ and ‘Medical Event Form’ will be completed, and the 
participant will be monitored by the medical professional.  
3) Expired breath Carbon Monoxide increase : If the average of two consecutive CO 
measurements  meets  the criteria  below  then the ‘Medical  Event  Form’  will be completed 
and the participant will be monitored by the medical professional.  
a. CO is greater  than 50 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is <20 ppm.  
b. CO is greater  than 60 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 20 – 34 ppm.  
c. CO is greater  than 70 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 35 – 49 ppm.  
d. CO is greater  than 80 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 50 – 64 ppm.  
e. CO is greater  than 90 ppm if CO at Baseline  1 is 65 – 80 ppm.  
4) Any hospitalization or debilitation  in which participation in the study could be detrimental 
to the recovery  process.  This will be self-reported  by the participant  and will be reviewed 
by the site PI and medical  professional  to determine  whether  continued  participation  in the 
study is appropriate.  
5) If a participant  is behaving  in an inappropriate  or threatening  manner,  admits  to lying about 
eligibility criteria, is participating in other smoking research studies that could affect the 
primary outcome measures, etc., then the PI can withdraw him/her from the study at the 
PI’s discretion.  
6) If a participant fails to attend regularly scheduled research assessment visits or comply 
with the research  procedures  or schedule,  then the PI can withdraw  him/her  from the study 
at the PI’s discretion.  
7) Increase  in psychiatric  symptoms:  Exacerbation  in symptoms  noted  during  the study  (i.e., 
change in BDI category from mild to moderate or moderate to severe) will trigger review 
by the study’s  licensed  medical  professional.  The PI will withdraw  the participant  upon  the 
licensed medical professional’s recommendation.  
 
 14. Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board   
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
43  
 A Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  has been  established  to monitor  safety  outcomes 
and will be comprised of four members. The DSMB will be chaired by Kevin Delucchi, PhD., 
Professor  in Residence  of Biostatistics  in Psychiatry  at the University  of California  San Francisco 
and Director of the Quantitative Core of the San Francisco Treatment Research Center; Eden 
Evins, MD, MPH., Cox Family Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director 
of Center for Addiction Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital; Ari Kirshenbau m, Ph.D.,  
Professor of Psychology at Saint Michael's College who he teaches courses in 
psychopharmacology and neuroscience, and currently has grants from NIH and NSF for work in 
human behavioral pharmacology and his grant -funded work focuses on cognitive and behavioral 
responses  to nicotine  and cannabinoids;  and Elisabeth  Johnson,  Ph.D.,  who has over twenty  years 
of clinical experience in women’s health and pediatrics, including caring for women with 
substance use disorders.  
Conflict  of Interest  
None  of the board  members  will be otherwise  affiliated  with the center  and each  member  will 
complete a conflict of interest disclosure form prior to each meeting.  Ad hoc specialists may be 
invited to participate as non -voting members at any time if additional expertise is desired.  
 
Monitoring  Activities  and Frequency  of Meetings  
The DSMB will set their own agenda and decisions about monitoring; e.g. how frequently to 
monitor, what threshold requires changes to protocol or stopping the study, and whether to view 
raw or analyzed  data.  The DSMB  will be given  FDA and EMEA  guidelines  for DSMBs  and recent 
reviews on DSMBs. A brief report will be generated from each meeting for the study record and 
forwarded to each of the study site’s Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and NIDA’s Program 
Officer with the progress report. The DSMB will be available to convene outside of the regular 
meetings, if necessary.  If concerns should arise regarding a particular subject, or any 
troublesome trends in the experiences of participants, they will make appropriate 
recommendations for changes in protocol, as needed.  The project investigators will continue to 
examine  safety  data,  blind  to study  condition,  in case  they wish to make  study 
modifications.  Before modifications are made, they will inform the DSMB and request their 
comments.  
 
Communication  Plan to IRB, NIDA,  and FDA (if applicable)  
All IRBs, the FDA and the NIDA’s Program Officer will be informed of any significant action 
taken  as a result  of the Data  and Monitoring  Board’s  findings.  Study  Participants  will be informed 
of any changes in risk.  
 
Protection  of Confidentiality  
For DSMB  meetings  only de-identified  data,  including  blinded  study  site and condition  type, 
will be provided to the board.  All data and discussion during the meeting will be confidential.  
 
 
  15. Investigational  Tobacco Product   
 
The University of Vermont Center on Tobacco Regulatory Science will complete an 
Investigational Tobacco Product (ITP) application with the FDA to cover the experimental 
cigarettes being used in this study.  This application encompasses both Project 2 sites.  
 
 16. Certificate  of Confidentiality   
CHRMS (Medical) #19 -0130 Approved: 1/23/2023  
44  
 To help protect  the participant’s  privacy,  Dr. Stephen  Higgins,  PhD,  will obtain  a Certificate  of 
Confidentiality from the national Institute on Drug Abuse. With this certificate, the researchers 
cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify the participants, even by a court 
subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other 
proceedings. The researchers will use the Certificate to resist any demands for information that

The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the participant or a member of their family 
from voluntarily releasing information about themselves and their involvement in the research. If 
an insurer,  employer  or other  person  obtains  the participant’s  written  consent  to receive  research 
information, then the researcher may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.  
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from disclosing 
voluntarily,  without  consent,  information  that would  identify  the individual  as a participant  of the 
research project in instances such as evidence of child abuse or a participant's threatened 
violence to self or others.

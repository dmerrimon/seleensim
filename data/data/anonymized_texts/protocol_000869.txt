STUDY No: LTS12551  
TITLE  Open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of  
dupilumab in patients with asthma who participated in a previous dupilumab  
asthma clinical study 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Worldwide 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT  Phase 2b/Phase 3. 
STUDY OBJECTIVES  Primary objective   
• To evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of dupilumab in 
patients with  asthma who participated in a previous dupilumab 
asthma clinical study (DRI12544, PDY14192, EFC13579, EFC13691).  
 
Secondary objectives   
• To evaluate the long-term efficacy of dupilumab in patients with 
asthma who
 participated in a previous dupilumab asthma clinical 
study. 
• To evaluate dupilumab in patients with asthma who participated in 
previous  dupilumab asthma clinical study, with regard to: 
- systemic exposure; 
- anti-drug antibodies (ADA); 
- biomarkers. 
STUDY DESIGN Multinational, multicenter, open-la bel, extension study evaluating  
dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks (q2w) for 1-year 
(48 weeks) or 2-year (96 w eeks) treatment duration.  
Patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 approval will continue to participate in the 2-year treatment  duration; patients enrolled after 
Amendment 04 approval will participate in the 1-year treatment duration.  
At enrollment, patients will be on medium or high dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and at least one ot her asthma controller medication, as 
maintained during the parent study in  which they participated (including
 
asthma background controller therapy with oral corticosteroids [OCS] only for patients from Study EFC13691).  
The clinical trial consists of 3 periods:
 
• Enrollment period: Combined V1/V2 Visit: Eligible patients from PDY14192, EFC13579, and EFC13691 studies should rollover into 
LTS12551 the same day as the  end-of-treatment visit of the parent  
study .  
- Note : A screening period of 0 to 3 weeks was proposed only 
for patients rolling over from DRI12544. Enrollment from Study 
DRI12544 is complete, thus the screening period does not 
apply anymore. 
• Treatment period: 48 or 96 weeks open-label treatment.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 4 - Patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 approval will continue  
to participate in the 2-year treatment duration; patients enrolled
after Amendment 04 approval will participate in the 1-year treatment duration. During the open-label treatment period, 
patients will continue taking their background controller 
therapy, as maintained during the parent study or as modified based on Investigator's judgment. 
• Post-treatment period: 12 weeks.
  
- Upon completion of the open-label treatment period (or 
following early discontinuation of  investigational medicinal 
product [IMP]) patients will continue into the post-treatment period. During this period, patients will receive their 
background controller regimen, as maintained during the open-label treatment period or as modified based on 
Investigator's judgment (eg, taking into account the reduction 
of dupilumab levels over time upon completion of the treatment
period).  
STUDY POPULATION  
 
Main selection criteria  Main inclusion criteria 
Eligible patients who have completed the treatment period in a previous 
dupilumab asthma study (PDY14192, EFC13579, EFC13691) or patients 
with asthma who completed the treatment and follow-up periods in previous 
dupilumab asthma Study DRI12544 may be enrolled in the LTS12551 
study. 
 
Main exclusion criteria 
Patients who experienced any hypersensitivity reactions to IMP in the 
previous dupilumab asthma study, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
could indicate that continued treatment with dupilumab may present an 
unreasonable risk for the patient.  
For the complete list of inclusion/e xclusion criteria, please refer to the 
relevant sections of the full protocol.  
Total expected number of patients The total number of patients to parti cipate is approximately 2206 (including a  
number of adolescent patients [aged 12 years to less than 18 years] that willnot exceed the sum of adolescent patients enrolled in the parent studies).

Study visits are performed q2w (ie, t wice a month / approximately q2w) during 
the first 3 months of study (up to Visit 8), every month during the next 3 months (up to Visit 11), and every 3 months up to the End-of-Treatment (EOT) Visit. In addition, monthly te lephone contacts will be performed after 
Week 24/Month 6 (Visit 11).  
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 Sample size determination  
The study size is predicated on the overall size of the parent studies;  
hence, the maximum number of patients to participate will correspond 
to the sum of the total number of patients enrolled in the DRI12544, PDY14192, EFC13579, and EFC13691 studies.  
 
Analysis population  
Safety population is defined as the patients exposed to dupilumab 
during LTS12551, regardless of the amount of treatment administered.  
The treatment-emergent period is defined as the time from the first 
dose of dupilumab in LTS12551 up to the last dose of dupilumab plus 
2 weeks (one dose interval) plus 12 weeks (follow-up period duration). 
 
Primary analysis 
The primary analysis of this study is the number (n) and percentage (%) of 
patients experiencing any
 TEAE, which will be summarized using  
descriptive statistics.  
Each adverse event (AE)/TEAE will be c oded according to the version of 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) in effect at 
sanofi as of the time of database lock.  
Analysis of secondary endpoints  
All analyses will be done descriptively on the safety population.

DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per
patient) Enrollment period : 
• For patients coming from PDY14192, EFC13579, and EFC13691, enrollment should be done at the Combined V1/V2 Visit (ie, on the 
same day as  the end-of-treatment visit of the parent study  combined 
with Visit 1 and Visit 2 of LTS12551 study).  
- Note: A screening period of 0 to 3 weeks was proposed only 
for patients rolling over from DRI12544. Enrollment from Study 
DRI12544 is complete, thus the screening period does not 
apply anymore. 
 
The (open-label) treatment  period is:  
• 48 weeks (1 year) for patients enrolled after Amendment 04 approval
or  
•  96 weeks (2 years) for patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 approval.  
 The post-treatment period  is 12-weeks. 
 The total study duration, per patients, is a maximum of 108 weeks (or 111 weeks considering a maximum screening period of 3 weeks for 
Study
 DRI12544) for the patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 
approval and a maximum of 60 weeks for the patients enrolled after Amendment 04 approval.

e-CRF. 
k Vital signs: blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (beats per minute) , respiratory rate (breaths per minute), body temperature (deg rees Celsius), and body weight (kg) will be measured at each visit. Height (cm) will 
only be measured at the Enrollment (Combined V1/V2) Visit. Vital signs will be measured in the sitting position using the same arm at each visit and w ill be measured prior to  IMP administration at  the clinic visits. 
l Clinical laboratories: Hematology: blood count (erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes), differential blood count (ne utrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and platelets. Serum 
chemistry: total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubi n), ALT, AST, ALP, total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, CPK, glucose, creatinine, 
BUN, uric acid, bicarbonate and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride). At enrollment, clinical laboratory testing results are collected from the parent study for HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb, total HBcAb, HCVAb, HIV 
screen (Anti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies) and ANA (ie, since these tests were scheduled at the visit prior to the  end-of-treatment visit of the PDY14192, EFC13579 or EFC13691 parent study ). In addition, results 
from hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) testing and HCV virus RNA (HCV RNA) testing should be collected for those patients who wer e HBsAg negative and HBcAb positive, and/or HCVAb positive; also anti-
-double-strand DNA antibody results for patients with ANA positive ( ≥1:160 titer). Note: Japanese patients who have rolled over from DRI12544 study should be retested for hepatitis B (HBsAg, HBsAb , and 
HBcAb), after Visit 1, at any time during the LTS12551 study, via the earliest scheduled study visit, after IRB approval for Lo cal Amendment 03 (Japan). 
m A negative serum pregnancy test was obtained at Visit 1, prior to Start-of-Treatment, for patients coming from DRI12544. Qualif ying pregnancy test for patients coming from PDY14192, EFC13579, and EFC13691 
studies will be the urine pregnancy test. 
n Urinalysis: pH, gluc ose, ketones, leukocyte esterase  blood, protein, nitrate, ur obilinogen, and bilirubin (by dipstick).

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by airway 
hyper-responsiveness, acute and chronic bronchoc onstriction, airway edema, and mucus plugging. 
The inflammatory component of asthma invol ves many cell types, including mast cells, 
eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, epithelial cells, and their biological products. For most 
asthma patients, a regimen of controller therapy and reliever therapy provi des adequate long-term 
control. However, it is estimated that 5% to 10% of asthma patients have symptomatic disease despite maximum recommended treatment with combinations of anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator drugs. These patients account fo r many hospital admissions, use of emergency 
services, and unscheduled physician visits ( 1). 
Additionally, the long-term adverse effects of sy stemic and inhaled cor ticosteroids (ICS) on bone 
metabolism, adrenal function, and growth in child ren lead to attempts to minimize the amount of 
corticosteroid usage. Lastly, the consequences  of unresponsiveness to therapy or lack of 
compliance with therapy is loss of asthma control and ultimately, asthma exacerbation and 
medical sequelae of such events. 
The poor response of some patient s with asthma may reflect the number of cellular and molecular 
mechanisms operative in asthma. There is increasing interest in distinct phenotypes because 
targeted therapy is more likely to be successf ul in patients with simila r underlying pathobiologic 
features ( 2). Recent therapeutic approaches in asthma ha ve been focused on trying to control the 
T-helper cell-2 response. Up-regulation of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) has been implicated as an important inflammatory  component of asthma disease progression.  
Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody (m Ab) that binds specifically to the shared 
interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4R α) subunit of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complexes, is under 
development as a potential novel treatment for asth ma. Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the 
Type I receptor, and both IL-4 and IL-13 signa ling through the Type II receptor. Dupilumab 
belongs to the pharmacological class of immunomodulators, interleukin inhibitors.  
For complete information regarding the preclinical and clinical evaluation of dupilumab to date, including ongoing studies, see the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
4.2 RATIONALE 
An initial demonstration of the efficacy and safety of dupilumab was provided in the randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2a stud y (ACT11457). This study 
investigated the effects of dupilumab adminis tered subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for 
12 weeks as compared to placebo on the incidenc e of asthma exacerbations in patients with 
persistent moderate to se vere eosinophilic asthma.

SAR231893-LTS12551 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 27 The primary endpoint was the occurrence of an  asthma exacerbation; the secondary endpoints 
included a range of measures of asthma control.  Effects on various type 2 helper T-cell (Th2) 
associated biomarkers and safety and tolerability are also evaluated ( 3).The ACT11457 study 
showed an 87% reduction in asthma exacerbations  after 12-week of treatment with dupilumab 
(5.8%) versus placebo (44.2%). A rapid improveme nt of lung function, as measured by f orced 
expiratory volume in 1 second  (FEV 1) and reduction of Th2-associated biomarkers levels were also 
observed ( 3).  
The DRI12544 study (phase 2b), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging 
study, evaluated several dose regimens of dup ilumab in patients with moderate to severe 
uncontrolled asthma (300 mg every 2 weeks [q2w ] with a 600 mg loading dose, 200 mg q2w with 
a 400 mg loading dose, 300 mg every 4 weeks [q4w] with a 600 mg loading dose, 200 mg q4w with a 400 mg loading dose), administered over 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in FEV
1 at Week 12, in patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts of at 
least 300 eosinophils per µL (HEos). Several s econdary efficacy endpoints were evaluated 
including: the annualized severe asthma exacerbation rate, percentage change from baseline in FEV
1, time to severe exacerbation, etc. For the primary endpoint, all dupilumab dose regimens 
(except for the 200 mg q4w) showed a clinical ly meaningful and statistically significant 
improvement in FEV 1 at Week 12 in comparison with placebo in the high blood eosinophil count 
(HEos) population. For the secondary endpoint s assessed in the overall population and the 
subgroup with eosinophil counts of fewer than 300 eosinophils per µL, dupilumab q2w (both the 200 mg and 300 mg) resulted in significant increases in FEV
1 (L) compared with placebo at  
Week 12 that were sustained through to week 24. Both doses of dupilumab q2w also resulted in 
significant increases in percentage change in FEV 1 compared with placebo through to Week 24 in 
the overall population and in the two subgroups . In addition, both the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg 
q2w dose regimens of dupilumab demonstrated as compared to placebo, a significant reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbati ons and a delayed time to  first severe asthma 
exacerbation event, during the treatment period.( 4) 
LTS12551 is designed as an open-label extension study to evaluate the long-term safety and 
tolerability of dupilumab in  patients with asthma who participated in previous dupilumab study. 
The dose of 300 mg q2w, which is the highest dose administered in Study DRI12544 and the phase 3 pivotal Study EFC13579, has been sele cted as the dose to be evaluated in 
Study LTS12551. This dosing regimen is within th e range of SC doses administered to healthy 
volunteers in R668-AS-0907 study and a higher dosing regimen of 300 mg qw was tested in the ACT11457. Additionally, 300 mg q2w (for 24 weeks) SC is the highest dose-regimen that was tested in DRI12544, a randomized, double-blind, pl acebo controlled dose-ranging efficacy study 
(phase 2b).  Treatment with dupilu mab was generally well tolerated in these previous studies. The 
dosing regimen of 300 mg SC q2w is also the higher of the two doses selected for Study EFC13579 (QUEST), it is anticipated to saturate the targeted receptors and to allow for the attainment of an optimally effi cacious concentration. Furthermore, in Study DRI12544, treatment 
effects on lung function and biomarkers of infl ammation were similar at 200 mg q2w and 300 mg 
q2w, suggesting a plateauing of the dose-response below exposures achieved at 300 mg qw.  
From a safety perspective, the mean exposure following a dose of 300 mg of dupilumab q2w at 
steady state is 2 to 3 times below the exposure range of SC doses of 300 mg administered every

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 28 week in the Proof of Concept studies in asthma (ACT11457) and atopic dermatitis 
(R668-AD1117).  
From an efficacy perspective the dosing regime n of 300 mg q2w, added to a medium-to-high dose 
ICS +  Long-acting β adrenoceptor  agonists (LABA) in adult patient s with uncontrolled persistent 
asthma, showed a clinically meaningful and highly statistically significant reduction in the relative 
risk of severe exacerbations, improvement in lung function (FEV 1) and asthma symptoms 
(Asthma Control Questionnaire 5-question Version [ACQ5]) ( 4). 
A loading dose of 600 mg dupilumab was administered on Day 1 for patients enrolling into LTS12551 from the DRI12544 study after a 3-month dupilumab-free follow-up period, which allow systemic concentrations to reach steady state faster, and potentially reduce the time to 
clinical effect. Loading dose will not apply to patients from other parent studies, as they will rollover into LTS12551 the same day as the end-of-t reatment (EOT) visit in the parent study and 
thus there will be no interruption in treatment.   
The dose regimens used in the 3 ongoing parent studies were 300 mg q2w and 200 mg q2w versus 
placebo (52 week treatment) in study EFC13579; 300 mg q2w versus placebo (24 week treatment) in study EFC13691); and 300 mg q2w versus pl acebo (12 weeks treatment) in study PDY14192 
(Phase 2). 
The LTS12551 study is intended to provide a long-t erm safety database to  better identify potential 
late onset adverse events (AEs) associated with  the use of dupilumab given on top of ICS/LABA 
or ICS and other controller background therap ies (LABA, leukotriene receptor antagonists 
(LTRA), long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), theophylline, etc) including oral 
corticosteroids (OCS). Efficacy, dupilumab concentration and anti-dupilumab antibody and associated biomarkers will also be analyzed in th e study to deepen the scientific understanding of 
anti-drug antibody (ADA) development and the cha nge of serum biomarkers over the course of 
the study.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
Multinational, multicenter, open- label, extension study evaluating dupilumab 300 mg (SC) q2w 
for 1-year (48 weeks) or 2-year (96 weeks)  treatment duration. Patie nts enrolled prior to 
Amendment 04 approval will continue to participate in the 2-year treatment duration; patients 
enrolled after Amendment 04 appr oval will participate in the 1-year treatment duration.  
At enrollment, patients will be on medium or high dose of ICS and at least one other asthma controller medication, as maintained  during the parent study in whic h they participated (including 
asthma background controller therapy with OCS only for patients from Study EFC13691).  
 For a schematic study design please see Section 1.1 . 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
LTS12551 study consists of 3 periods (See Section 10 ):  
Enrollment period : Combined V1/V2 Visit: Eligible  patients from PDY14192, EFC13579, and 
EFC13691 studies should rollover into LTS12551 the same day as the end-of-treatment visit of the 
parent study .  
Note: A screening period of 0 to 3 weeks was proposed only for patients rolling over from 
DRI12544. Enrollment from Study DRI12544 is comp lete, thus the screening period does not 
apply anymore. 
Treatment period : 48 or 96 weeks open- label treatment.  
Patients enrolled prior to Amendment 04 approval, will continue to participate in the 2-year 
treatment duration; patients enrolled after Amendment 04 approval will participate in the 1-year treatment duration. During the open-label treatme nt period, patients will c ontinue taking their 
background controller therapy, as maintained durin g the parent study or as modified based on 
Investigator's judgment. 
Post-treatment period : 12 weeks.  
Upon completion of the open-labe l treatment period (or following early discontinuation of 
Investigational Medicinal Product [IMP]) patients will continue into the post-treatment period. 
During this period, patients will continue their background controller therapy, as maintained 
during the open-label treatment period or as modifi ed based on Investigator's judgment (eg, taking 
into account the reduction of dupilumab leve ls over time upon completion of the treatment 
period).

8.1 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
8.1.1 Dupilumab 
Note: At the time of Amendment 04, all patients have been tran sitioned to prefilled syringes. 
Dupilumab is supplied as a sterile aqueous solu tion for SC injection at the concentration of 
150 mg/mL in glass prefilled syringes (2.25 mL tota l volume) to deliver 300 mg in the extractable 
2 mL volume. 
8.1.2 Preparation of investigational product 
The IMP should be stored in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) until use. Instructions for 
IMP preparation are provided in the pharmac y manual and Patient User Instructions for 
self-administration. 
8.1.3 Dose schedule 
The IMP is administered every 14±3 days (q2w). The consecutive doses of the IMP must be 
separated by ≥11 days to avoid an overdose. Reminder: Patients will be monitored for any signs or 
symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions for a minimum of 30 minutes after IMP injection.  
At the Enrollment (Combined V1/V2) Visit, the Investigator or delegate will train the patient (and/or caregiver[s]) how to prepare and inject IM P for the first injection or if the patient is 
already self-injecting (in the parent study), the Investigator or delegate will supervise the  
self-injection. 
For subsequent doses, which are not given at the study site, specific pages will be provided to the 
patients to record information related to the injections. The pages will be kept as source data in the patient’s study file.  
If the patient (or caregiver) is unable or unwilling to administer IMP, arrangements must be made 
for qualified site personnel and/or healthcare professionals (eg, visiting nurse service) to administer IMP for the doses that are not sc heduled to be given at the study site. 
If the study visit is not performed at the study site as scheduled, the dos e will be administered by 
the patient and/or their caregiver/healthcare professi onal, or arrangements must be made for a visit 
to the site to administer the IMP.  
When IMP is administered at home, the patients must  be advised by the site staff, to self-monitor 
for at least 30 minutes after administration for potential signs and symptoms that may suggest a 
hypersensitivity reaction.

(avoiding navel and waist areas), the upper thighs, or  upper arms (lateral side), so that the same 
site is not injected twice consecutively. Injecti on in the upper arms could be done only by a trained 
person (parent/caregiver trained by Investigator or delegate) or health care professional but not the  
patient themselves. For each injection, the anatomic site of administration will be recorded in the 
electronic case report form (e-CRF) and, as applicable, the home dosing diary.  
Detailed instructions for transport, storage, prep aration, and administration of IMP are provided to 
the patient. Patients will complete a home dosing diary to document compliance with self-injection (or parent 
or caregiver injection) of IMP.

Inhaled corticosteroid and other controller therapies (ie, LABA, LTRA, LAMA, theophylline, etc) 
and OCS for patients from EFC13691 will be collected in the e-CRF.  
8.2.1.1 Enrollment V1/V2 visit (combined with the end-of-treatment visit of parent study) 
Patients will be on background asthma therapy of moderate or hi gh-dose ICS as maintained in the 
parent study. Patients will also be using additional asthma controller therapies initiated during the parent study. 
Please see Appendix B  for a list of commonly used asthma controller medications. 
8.2.1.2 Open-label treatment period 
During the open-label treatment  period, patients will continue the background therapy dose 
regimen as maintained in the parent study or as modified based on Investigator's judgment. 
See Appendix B  for the most commonly used asthma controller therapies.  
8.2.1.3 Post-treatment period 
Upon completion of the open-label treatment period (or following early discontinuation of IMP) 
patients will continue into the post-treatment period, with their background controller therapy 
dose regimen as maintained over the open-label  treatment period or as modified based on 
Investigator's judgment (eg, taking into a ccount the reduction of dup ilumab levels over time upon 
completion of the treatment period).

Not applicable. 
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
The study medication will be administered only to patients included in this study following the 
procedures described in the clinical study protoc ol. The 7-digits serialized treatment kit number 
will be generated centrally by sanofi clinical s upply team. The IMPs are packaged in accordance 
with this list.  
The patients will be identified by the same identification number used in the parent study. The 
investigational site will enter the patient tracking information for patient identification number, into the Interactive Voice Response System/I nteractive Web Response System (IVRS/IWRS) 
during each scheduled protocol visit. The trea tment allocation will be performed centrally by 
IVRS/IWRS. The clinical site coordinator will document the patient number and the treatment kit number in the e-CRF and in the patient’s sour ce documents, and the patient number on the IMP 
label prior to dispensing to the patient. 
The patient will be considered to be enrolled in the study once a treatment kit number has been 
assigned by the IVRS/IWRS. Therefore, it is important that all inclusion/exclusion criteria are confirmed and all required procedures are completed prior to the enrollment contact to the IVRS/IWRS. Detailed IVRS/IWRS procedure will be provided in the IVRS/IWRS Site Manual. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
Note: At the time of Amendment 04, all patients have been tran sitioned to prefilled syringes. 
The IMP dupilumab will be packaged in single-use prefilled syringes. One kit box will contain one prefilled syringe. When dupilu mab administration occurs at home, enough kit boxes will be 
given to the patients for the period of the treatment until the next study visit. 
Each packaging component will be labeled with the project and study number, a medication kit 
number, packaging reference number, Sponsor name , quantity or contents, dispensing instruction, 
caution statement, “use by” date and storage conditions. The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
The IMP should be stored at a temperature betwee n 2°C and 8°C (36°F to 46°F) in an appropriate 
and locked room under the responsibility of the Investigator or other authorized persons (eg, pharmacists) in accordance with local regulations, labeling specifications, policies, and procedures.

information on in-use stability and instructi ons for handling the IMP should be managed 
according to the rules provided by the Sponsor. 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or othe r personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained, 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordan ce with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labelin g, expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to re call IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Measures taken to ensure and document trea tment compliance and IMP accountability include: 
• Proper recording of treatment kit number as required on appropriate e-CRF page for accounting purposes: 
• All medication treatment kits (whether empty or unused) are returned by the patient at 
each visit that treatment dispensing is planned. 
- The completed patient injection sheet (returned to the site at each visit), returned 
treatment kit boxes, and any unused pref illed syringes will be used for drug 
accountability purposes. 
• The Investigator or designee tracks treatment accountability/compliance, either by the injection sheet or by counting the number of used treatment kits, and fills in the appropriate page of the patient treatment log. 
The monitor in charge of the study then checks the data entered on the IMP administration page by comparing them with the IMP that has been retrieved and the patient treatment log form.

All partially used or unused trea tment kits will be retr ieved by the Sponsor or destroyed at the 
study site. All used prefilled syringes should be ke pt in a sharp-container by the patients and be 
returned to sites for destroy. The Investigator  will not destroy any unused IMP unless the Sponsor 
provides written authorization. 
A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by the Inve stigator and the monitoring team.  
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient concomitantly to IMP. 
8.8.1 Prohibited concomitant medication 
The following concomitant treatments are not permitted during the study: 
• Anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy (eg, omalizumab); 
• Biologic therapy; 
• Systemic immunosuppressants;  
• Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy; 
• Non-selective beta-adrenergic blockers; 
• Other investigational drugs; 
• Live/attenuated vaccines (see  Appendix A ).

8.8.3 Cytochrome P450 (CYP) precaution 
The impact of dupilumab on cytochrome P450 (CYP ) enzyme activity has not been studied and 
the effect of dupilumab on levels of IL-4 and IL-13 has not been fully characterized.  
However, IL-4 was reported to up-regu late CYP2E1, 2B6, 3A 4 mRNA expression or 
down-regulate CYP1A2 mRNA (12, 13). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
incubated with various Th2 cyt okines showed that IL-4 and IL-13 increased mRNA expression of 
CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 (14). Since the clinical significance of the limited in vitro findings for IL-4 
and IL-13 involvement in CYP regulation and the impact of dup ilumab on CYP enzymes is not 
fully understood, during the study treatment and at least up to the end of follow-up, caution should 
be used for drugs which are metabolized via these CYP isoforms and which have a narrow 
therapeutic index. Close clinical observation and/or laboratory monitoring as applicable are required when the investigational product is started or stopped in order to enable early detection 
of toxic manifestations or lack of activity/effica cy of these drugs, followed by dose adjustment or 
their withdrawal if needed. Some examples of CYP450 substrates with narrow therapeutic index 
are provided in  Appendix C .

9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT 
The primary endpoint of this study is the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing 
any treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE). 
Adverse events, serious adverse ev ents (SAEs), adverse events of special interest (AESI), AEs 
leading to IMP discontinuation and death will be collected from the date of the signed informed 
consent form (ICF) for participation in LTS12551  (planned at the Combined V1/V2 Visit). The 
study specific and general safety criteria are detailed in Section 10.4.1. To assure the continuing safety of patients in this study,  an Independent DMC will be res ponsible for reviewing the safety 
data on a periodic basis throughout the course of the study as outlined in Section 6.2 .  
Adverse events, AESIs, SAEs, AEs leading to IMP discontinuation and deaths will be reported as described in Section 10.4.1 and analyzed as in Section 11.4.3.  
Safety Observations
 
• The Investigator should take all appropriate meas ures to ensure the safety of the patients. 
Notably, he/she should follow-up the outcome of SAEs/AESIs until c linical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or death. In all cases, this may imp ly that observations will continue beyond the 
last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investiga tions may be requested by the 
Sponsor. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient. 
• In the case of any SAE/AESI requiring immediate notification, being brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient, and considered by him/her to be caused by th e investigational produc t with a reasonable 
possibility, this should be reported to the Sponsor. 
9.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 
9.2.1 Safety and tolerability  
The following parameters will be analyzed (see also Section 11.4.3.1.4 for analysis): 
• Vital signs. 
• Physical examination. 
• Electrocardiogram (ECG) variables. 
• Clinical laboratory tests.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 43 9.2.1.1 Vital signs 
Vital signs, including blood pre ssure (mmHg), heart rate (beats  per minute), respiratory rate 
(breaths per minute), body temperature (degrees Ce lsius), and body weight (kg) will be measured 
at every scheduled treatment visit (see flow charts Section 1.2  and Section 1.3 ). Height (cm) will 
only be measured at enrollment. Vital signs will be measured in the sitting position using the same 
arm at each visit, and will be measured prior to receiving investigational product at the study 
visits.  
9.2.1.2 Physical examination 
Physical examinations will include an assessment of general appearance, skin, eyes, ear/nose/throat, heart, chest,  abdomen, reflexes, lymph nodes, spine, and extremities. All 
deviations from normal will be recorded, including those attributable to the patient’s disease. Physical examinations will be performed as per the schedule of assessments (see flow charts Section 1.2 and Section 1.3 ). 
9.2.1.3 Electrocardiogram (ECG) variables 
A 12-lead ECG will be performed as per the schedule of assessments (see flow charts Section 1.2  
and Section 1.3 ). A minimum of 3 complexes in an appropriate lead (lead II) will be averaged to 
determine the PR-interval, QT/QTc-interval, and QRS-complex (and heart rate will also be measured) for each ECG.  
The Investigator should review the ECG and docu ment his interpretation, signed and dated on the 
ECG print out. The original trace is kept as source data. Electrocardiogram tracings are also read 
manually by independent, certif ied and “centralized” cardiologists, who determine ECG 
parameters and who in addition aler t the Investigator and the Sponsor  of any clinically significant 
findings or changes. These manually read tracings are the ECG tracing of record for this clinical trial. A specific written manual regarding the procedures related to the centralized ECG reading are provided to each Investigator. Refer to the ECG manual for further details.  
Notes:  Any abnormal ECG parameter should be immediately rechecke d for confirmation before 
making a decision of permanent discontinuation of treatment with dupilu mab for the concerned 
patient.  
9.2.1.4 Clinical laboratory tests 
The clinical laboratory tests will be conducted by an accredited cen tral laboratory with national 
and regional clinical licenses, as required for di agnostic testing, and must provide evidence of 
participation in proficiency testing, as appropriate. After reviewing the laboratory report and 
evaluating any results that are outside the normal range, the Investigator must sign and date the 
laboratory report. Abnormal laboratory values that are considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator must be repeated as soon as possi ble after receiving the laboratory report, to rule 
out laboratory error. Persistent abnormal laboratory values should be repeated until they return to normal or until an etiology of the pe rsistent abnormalit y is determined.

9.2.2.1 Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) 
The FEV 1 is part of the spirometry assessment and will be performed as per the schedule of 
assessments (see flow charts in Section 1.2  and Section 1.3 ).  
A spirometer that meets the 2005 American Thor acic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory 
Society (ERS) recommendations will be used. The ATS/ERS Standardization of Spirometry should be used as a guideline (5). Spirometry should be done at approximately th e same time of 
the day at each visit throughout the study. Pulmonary function tests should be performed in the morning if possible, but could be done at a di fferent time of the day. Spirometry will be 
performed after a washout period of bronchod ilators according to their action duration, 
eg, withholding the last dose of salbutamol/albut erol or levosalbutamol/leva lbuterol for at least 
6 hours and withholding the last dose of LABA for at least 12 hours (ultra-LABA like vilanterol should be withheld for at least 24 hours) and w ithholding the last dose of LAMA for at least 
24 hours. This should be verified before performing the measurements. 
9.2.2.2 ACQ-5 (Asthma Control Questionnaire, 5-question version) 
The ACQ-5 was designed to measure both the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontane ously or as a result of treatment. 
The ACQ-5 has 5 questions, reflecting the top-scor ing five asthma symptoms: woken at night by 
symptoms, wake in the mornings with symptoms, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath and wheeze. Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and 
to respond to the symptom questions on a 7- point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum 
impairment, see Appendix F ). 
A global score is calculated: the questions are eq ually weighted and the ACQ-5 score is the mean 
of the 5 questions and, therefore, between 0 (tot ally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). 
Higher score indicates lower asthma control. Patients with a score below 1.0 will have adequately controlled asthma and above 1.0 th eir asthma will not be well cont rolled. On the 7-point scale of 
the ACQ-5, a change or difference in score of 0.5 is the smallest that can be considered clinically

ACQ-5 will be performed as per the schedule of assessments (see flow charts in Section 1.2  and 
Section 1.3 ). ACQ-5 paper forms are completed and data will be entered into the e-CRF. The 
ACQ-5 will be done in those countries wher e a validated translation is available. 
9.2.2.3 Severe asthma exacerbation events 
Severe asthma exacerbation events  are defined as a deterior ation of asthma requiring: 
• Use of systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 days: 
- For patients from the EFC13691 study w ho entered the LTS12551 study taking 
systemic corticosteroids: the use of systemic corticosteroids at least double the dose currently used for ≥3 days. 
OR 
• Hospitalization or emergency room visit because of asthma, requiring systemic corticosteroids. 
See Section 10.4.1.1 for asthma exacerbation reporting. 
9.2.2.4 Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with standardized activities (AQLQ[S]) 
The AQLQ(S) was designed to measure the functi onal impairments that are most troublesome to 
patient as a result of their asthma (see Appendix E). The instrument is comprised of 32 items, 
each rated on a 7-point Likert scales from 1 to 7. The AQLQ(S) has 4 domains. The domains and the number of items in each domain are as follows: 
• Symptoms (12 items); 
• Activity limitation (11 items); 
• Emotional function (5 items); 
• Environmental stimuli (4 items).  
A global score is calculated ranging from 0 to 7 and a score by domain. Higher scores indicate 
better quality of life. The instrument has been used  in many clinical tria ls, and it has been shown 
to be reliable, valid (pa tient interviews), and sensitive to chan ge. It will be done in those countries 
where a validated translation is available. A MCID is available ( 7). 
AQLQ(S) will be measured as per the schedule of assessments (see flow charts in Section 1.2  and

9.2.2.7 Disease-specific, daily efficacy assessments 
All the data detailed in this section will no lo nger be collected for all patients upon approval 
of Amendment 04. 
Prior to Amendment 04, on a daily basis throughout the study, the patient used an electronic diary 
/ PEF meter to: 
• Measure morning and evening PEF; 
• Respond to the morning and evening asthma symptom scale questions; 
• Indicate the number of inhalations/day of salbutamol/albuterol or 
levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for symptom relief; 
• Record the number of inhalations/day of b ackground ICS and controller therapies used. 
9.2.2.7.1 Record the number of nocturnal awakenings and Peak expiratory flow 
Prior to Amendment 04, at Visit 1, patients were issued an elec tronic PEF meter for recording 
morning (AM) and evening (PM) PEF, daily salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol, morning and evening asthma symptom scores, number of nocturnal awakenings due to asthma symptoms and number of night time awakenings due to asthma symptoms that required reliever medications. Patients were instructed on the use of the device, and written instructions on the use of the electronic PEF meter were provided to the pa tients. In addition, the Investigator instructed 
the patients on how to record the following variables in the electronic PEF meter: 
• AM PEF performed within 15 minutes after arising (between 5:30 AM and 10:00 AM) prior 
to taking any albuterol or levalbuterol.

albuterol or levalbuterol. 
• Patients should try to withhold albuterol or levalbuterol for at least 6 hours prior to 
measuring their PEF. 
• Three PEF efforts will be performed by the patient; all 3 values were recorded by the 
electronic PEF meter, and the highes t value will be used for evaluation. 
Baseline AM PEF will be the mean AM measurement recorded for the 7 days prior to the first dose of IMP, and baseline PM PEF will be the mean PM measurement recorded for the 7 days prior to the first dose of investigational product or at least 4 days’ measurement for setting up the stability limit, prior to dosing in the LTS12551 study. 
9.2.2.7.2 Asthma Symptom Score  
Prior to Amendment 04, patients recorded overall symptom scores twice a day prior to measuring PEF. The patient’s overall asthma symptoms ex perienced during the waking hours were recorded 
in the evening (PM symptom score). Symptoms experienced during the night were recorded upon arising (AM symptom score). Baseline symptom scores will be the mean AM and mean PM scores recorded for the 7 days prior to the firs t dose of investigational product. Patients were 
instructed to record the severity of symptoms as follows: 
AM symptom score: 
• 0 = No asthma symptoms, slept through the night; 
• 1 = Slept well, but some complaints in the morning. No nighttime awakenings; 
• 2 = Woke up once because of asthma (including early awakening); 
• 3 = Woke up several times because of asthma (including early awakening); 
• 4 = Bad night, awake most of the night because of asthma. 
PM symptom score: 
• 0 = Very well, no asthma symptoms; 
• 1 = One episode of wheezing, cough, or breathlessness; 
• 2 = More than one episode of wheezing, coug h, or breathlessness without interference of 
normal activities; 
• 3 = Wheezing, cough, or breathlessness most of the day, which interfered to some extent 
with normal activities; 
• 4 = Asthma very bad. Unable to carry out daily activities as usual.

For patients from EFC13691 the prescribed backgr ound therapy with OCS will be recorded in the 
e-CRF.  
For the patients from the EFC13691 study only, the following 3 efficacy endpoints will be derived 
using the prescribed dose of the background OC S medications. The baseline OCS dose is the 
original baseline value from the EFC13691 study. 
• Percentage change from baseline in OCS dose; 
• Proportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS dose compared with the original baseline in the parent study; 
• Percentage of patients that  were able to be tapere d off completely of OCS. 
9.3 OTHER ENDPOINTS 
9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics and anti-dupilumab antibodies 9.3.1.1 Sampling time 
Blood samples collected before the IMP adminis tration are used for the determination of 
functional dupilumab and anti-dupilumab antibodies (also known as ADAs). Samples will be 
collected as per the schedule of assessments (see flow charts in Section 1.2  and Section 1.3 ). The 
date of collection should be recorded in the patient e-CRF. The date and time will also be 
collected on the central laboratory requisition form  and entered into the database through data 
transfers from the central laboratory. 
In the event of any SAE or any AESI of anaphylac tic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that 
are related to IMP and require tr eatment, or severe injection s ite reaction lasting longer than 
24 hours, samples will be collected near the onset and resolution of the event for any additional 
analysis if required or for archival purposes. An  unscheduled systemic drug concentration page 
(“PK page”) in the e-CRF must be completed as well. 
Pre-existing ADAs are defined as:  
• An ADA positive response in the assay at ba seline with all post- treatment ADA results 
negative, OR 
• An ADA positive response at baseline with a ll post-treatment ADA responses less than 
4-fold over baseline titer levels.

or missing. 
Treatment-boosted ADAs are defined as: 
• An ADA positive response in the assay post firs t dose that is greater-than or equal to 
4-fold over baseline titer levels, when baseline results are positive. 
Treatment-emergent ADA responses are further classified as Transient, Persistent or 
Indeterminate: 
a) Persistent Response: define d as a treatment-emergent response with two or more 
consecutive ADA positive sampling time points, separated by more than 12-week period 
(with no ADA negative samples in between). 
b) Indeterminate Response: defined as a treatment-emergent response with only the last collected sample positive in the ADA assay.  
c) Transient Response: defined as a treatment-e mergent response that is not considered 
persistent OR indeterminate. 
Unused samples collected for drug concentrati on or ADA analyses may be used for research 
purpose. 
9.3.1.2 Pharmacokinetics handling procedure 
It is extremely important to collect all blood samples as close to the protocol-specified time as possible. The reasons for any missed or lost  blood samples should be  documented. Special 
procedures for collection, storage, and shipping  of serum are described in separate operational 
manuals. An overview of handling procedure for samples used in the determination of drug 
concentration and ADA is provided in Table 3 .

No pharmacogenetics samples will be taken during this study. 
9.3.3 Pharmacodynamic variables 
Several biomarkers related to asthmatic inflammation, Th2 polar ization and possible IL-4/IL13 
activity will be assessed for their value in predicting therapeutic response and/or in documenting the time course of drug respons e. Sampling will be conducted as per the schedule of assessments 
(see flow charts in Section 1.2  and Section 1.3 ). More detailed information on the collection, 
handling, transport and preservation of samp les (eg, minimum volumes required for blood 
collection and for aliquots for ea ch biomarker assay) will be pr ovided in a separate laboratory 
manual. 
9.3.3.1 Whole blood biomarkers 
Eosinophilia is recognized as a marker for diag nosing and predicting risk of exacerbations in 
asthma. Eosinophils and Th2 cytokines play a cent ral role in the pathophysiology of severe 
asthma. Eosinophil count has been used to guid e treatment decisions in severe asthma. In 
LTS12551 study, blood eosinophil count will be measur ed as part of the standard 5-part white

9.3.3.2 Serum biomarkers  
Serum total IgE:  It has been widely recognized and reporte d that IgE levels correlate with asthma 
severity and bronchial hyper-responsiveness ( 8). Interleukin-4 regulates IgE synthesis in human 
lung ( 9). Interleukin-4, in combination with IL-13, induces the class switch–recombination to IgE 
by B-cells ( 10), ( 11). Anti-IgE therapy has been reported to decrease asthma exacerbation and the 
requirement for inhaled steroid therapy. In  the ACT11457 and DRI12544 studies, IgE  steadily 
declined throughout the treatment periods without  reaching a steady state. In DRI12544, total IgE 
and several antigen-specific IgEs declined > 50% from baseline during 24 weeks of treatment. 
This suggested that dupilumab may have the func tion of gradually desens itizing mast cells by 
decreasing surface coating with IgE. The IgE measurement in the LTS12551 study will help us 
better understand how the IgE level changes du ring the long-term dupilumab treatment.  
Serum total IgE will be measured with a qu antitative method (eg, ImmunoCAP) approved for 
diagnostic testing and will no longer be perform ed in the LTS12551 study, due to Amendment 04. 
Serum immunoglobin assay: IgA, IgG, and IgG1-4, IgM level will no longer be collected in the

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The LTS12551 study consists of 3 periods: 
• Enrollment period:  Combined V1/V2 Visit: Eligible patients from PDY14192, 
EFC13579 and EFC13691 studies should rollover into LTS12551 the same day as the 
end-of-treatment visit of the parent study . 
- Note: A screening period of 0 to 3 weeks wa s proposed only for patients rolling over 
from DRI12544. Enrollment from study DRI12544 is complete, thus the screening 
period does not apply anymore. 
• Treatment period : Open-label treatment for 48 weeks (1 year) for patients enrolled after 
approval of Amendment 04 or 96 weeks (2 years) for patients enrolled prior to 
Amendment 04 approval. 
During the open-label treatme nt period, patients will continue their background therapy 
dose regimen, as maintained in the parent st udy or as modified based on Investigator's 
judgment. 
• Post-treatment period : 12 weeks.  
The study visits should be performed on the planned dates (relative to the fi rst injection) and be 
adhered to within the ±3 day visit window with the first 12 weeks and ±1 week for the remaining 
study period. Monthly telephone contact should be done with patient after Week 24 to collect 
safety information. 
It is preferred that all study visits take place in the morning. The results of the evaluation will be 
recorded on the appropriate e-CRF pages. Prior to  all screening assessments, after discussion of 
participation in the study, the written consent form must be signed and dated. 
If a patient is prematurely discontinued from  treatment, EOT should be scheduled and all 
assessments planned at the EO T Visit should be performed.

PDY14192, EFC13579 and EFC13691 studies. 
The following activities are performed at the Enrollment (Combined V1/V2) Visit: 
• Obtain the signature of the informed consent for participation in LTS12551. 
• Review inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess eligibility.  
• If the patient meets all inclusion and does not meet any exclusi on criteria: Contact 
IVRS/IWRS to register the visits, confirm the patient’s number and receive the first 
treatment kit num ber assignment. 
• Collect patient’s demographic information, asth ma history (including allergy history and 
smoking habits), eligibility module, other medical and surgical history (including 
significant prior and concurrent illnesses), prior and concomitant medications, ICF, chest imaging, and IMP administration (via e-CRF pages). 
• Commence AE reporting from the time of the signature of the informed consent for participation in LTS12551 (a nticipated to be at the Combined V1/V2 Visit). 
• Record all medication use with start dose in the e-CRF. 
• Inquire about background asthma therapy tolerability. 
• Instruct the patient to continue the background ICS/LABA or ICS and controller therapy stabilized during the parent study. 
• Perform chest imaging (X-ray, MRI, or HRCT scan) if no chest imaging within the previous 12 months is available
2.  
• Dispense and administer IMP (see Section 8.1.3):  
- For those patients willing to perform self-injection, the Investigator or delegate will train the patient (or parent or caregiver) regarding preparation and injection of IMP 
and may inject the study medication, or th e patient (or parent or caregiver) may 
perform the injection under the supervision of the Investigator or delegate if the patient is already self-injecting from the parent study. 
- Document the training/supervision for IMP se lf-injection in the patient’s study file. 
- Patients should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each administration of IMP 
for any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. 
• Schedule appointment for next visit and remind patient to withhold bronchodilators 
according to their action duration, for ex ample, withholding the last dose of 
salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for at least 6 hours and withholding 
the last dose of LABA for at least 12 hours (u ltra-LABA like vilanterol should be withheld 
                                                 
2 Chest X-ray, MRI or HRCT will be performed only if no chest imaging results within the previous  
12 months are available. At the Investigator’s discretion (and based on local regulations) chest imaging 
may be performed during the study (eg, 1 year after the last chest imaging assessment or after a year’s treatment).

• Reminder: Sexually active female patients of reproductive potential are required to 
practice an acceptable contraception (as defined in E18 or local protocol amendment in case of specific local requirement) during the entire study duration, while taking 
dupilumab and for 12 weeks after the last IMP dose. Study sites should counsel all study 
patients, with special attention towards adolescent patients, regarding the importance of practicing responsible and effective contracep tion during the study and 12 weeks after the 
last dose.  
The following will be obtained from the end-of-treatment visit in the parent study  (PDY14192,

10.2 DEFINITION OF SOURCE DATA 
Source data is all information in original records a nd certified copies of original records of clinical 
findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and 
evaluation of the trial. Source data are cont ained in source documents. Source documents are 
original documents, data and records such as hospi tal records, clinic and office charts, laboratory 
notes, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, r ecorded data from automated instruments, etc. 
All the data collected in the e-CRF should be transcribed directly from source documents. Data 
downloaded from the study-associated central la boratories, spirometry, ECG, and patient 
electronic diary.  
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
The following conditions will be causes for temporary treatment discontinuation: 
• Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment.  
• Any laboratory abnormality that meets tempor ary treatment disconti nuation criteria as per 
Appendix D . 
In addition, temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by the Investigator because of suspected AEs. Re-initiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate 
clinical and/or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered (according to his/her best medical judgment) th at the AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after 
resuming therapy with IMP, that the responsibility of the IMP in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely, and that the selection criteria for the study are still met (see Section 7.1  and 
Section 7.2 ). 
For all temporary treatment discon tinuations, the Investigator shoul d record injections that are 
missed in the e-CRF IMP pages. 
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at any time.

SAR231893-LTS12551 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 79 In case permanent treatment disc ontinuation, the patient should be  scheduled for the EOT Visit 
and procedures and continue the 12-week  follow-up period for safety evaluation. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Inve stigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG para meter should be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation (within 24 hour s) before making a decision of pe rmanent discontinuation of the IMP 
for the concerned patient. Threshold values fo r the discontinuation of IMP are defined in 
collaboration with Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology (see  Appendix D ). 
The following criteria will lead to permanent treatment discontinuation:  
• At their own request or at the request of th eir legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on beha lf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research).  
• If, in the Investigator’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
patient’s well-being (see also safety Section  10.6). 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
• In the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor. 
• Pregnancy (Note: dupilumab should be stoppe d but patient should be followed up until 
delivery). 
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment. 
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. 
• Any opportunistic infection, such as tuberculosis  (TB) or other infections whose nature or 
course may suggest an immunoc ompromised status (See Appendix I ). 
• Serum ALT >3 Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) concurrent with Total Bilirubin >2 ULN (see Appendix D ). 
• Serum ALT >5 ULN if baseline ALT < 2 ULN or ALT >8 ULN if baseline  ALT >2 ULN ( Appendix D ). 
Note: Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a decision of perman ent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 80 10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be followed-up according to the study pr ocedures as specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to  recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed-up as specified in this protocol. 
After the permanent discontinuation of dupilumab, the patients will be assessed using the 
procedure normally planned for the EOT Visit. After 12 weeks follow-up time, the patients will be asked to return for the EOS assessments.  
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation s hould be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the CRF wh en considered as confirmed. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study  
 
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any  
time and irrespective of the reason. 
For patients who fail to return to the study site, th e Investigator should make the best effort to re-
contact  the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, reviewing available 
registries or  health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least 
his/her vital status.  Attempts to contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s 
records (eg, times and  dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedures normally planned for the EOT Visit, 
including a PK samp le, if appropriate. 
 
A patient should only be designated as lost to follow-up if the site is unable to establish contact
 with the patient after 3 documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e-mail, 
certified  letter, etc). 
Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be re-enrolled (treated) in the study. Their  
inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused. The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will 
specify how these  patients  lost to follow-up for their primary endpoints will be analyzed. The 
patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason.  
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 81 Asthma exacerbation events are collected as secondary efficacy endpoints via the “Asthma 
Exacerbation Event Form”. These events should not be reported as AEs unless they fulfill a 
seriousness criterion.  
For this study, asthma exacerbations should be managed by the Investigators based on their 
medical judgment and applicable national / international asthma management guidelines. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which  the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which  hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• Is a medically important event. 
Medical and scientific j udgment should be exercised in deci ding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalizatio n, but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which condition has to be considered as a medically im portant event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm, Anaphylaxis. See Appendix H  for the Definition of 
Anaphylaxis. 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc).  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
• Development of drug depe ndence or drug abuse. 
• ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or ALT increase >10 x ULN. 
• Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality. 
• Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling).

unusual/significant by the Investigators in oncology studies). 
• Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study (only if judged unusual/significant by the Invest igators in studies asse ssing specifically the 
effect of a study drug on these diseases). 
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such even ts may require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand them. AESIs may be added or removed during a study by protocol 
amendment. 
For these AESIs, the Sponsor will be inform ed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), per SAE 
notification described in Section 10.4.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding pages/screens in the e-CRF.  
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment (see Appendix H for Definition of Anaphylaxis). 
• Severe injection site reactions that last longer than 24 hours. 
• Any infection meeting at least one of the following criteria (see Section  10.6.3): 
- Any serious infection (SAE). 
- Requires parenteral (intravenous, intram uscular, SC) antimicrobial therapy. 
- Requires oral antimicrobial therapy for longer than 2 weeks. 
- Is a parasitic infection. 
- Is an opportunistic infection (see Appendix I ). 
Note: Antimicrobial therapy refers to antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal agents. 
• Significant ALT elevation:  
- ALT >5 x the ULN in patients with baseline ALT ≤2 x ULN; or 
- ALT >8 x ULN if baseline ALT >2 x ULN.  
• Pregnancy:  
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female partner of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section 10.4.1.2 ). 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued. 
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female partic ipant or in a female partner of a male 
participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined (see Section 9.2.1.4.1 ).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 83 • Symptomatic overdose with IMP/Non-IMP: 
- An accidental or intentional overdose with the IMP/Non-IMP is an event suspected by 
the Investigator or spontaneously notified by  the patient and defined as at least twice 
the planned dose during an interval of le ss than 11 days. The circumstances (ie, 
accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the verbatim and symptoms, if 
any, entered on separate AE forms. 
- An accidental or intentional overdose with any Non-IMP is an event suspected by the Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient and defined as at least twice of the 
intended dose within the intended therapeutic interval. The circumstances (ie, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the verbatim and symptoms, if 
any, entered on separate AE forms. 
10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relati onship to IMP/Non-IMP, spanning from the 
signature of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, are to be recorded  on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of 
the e-CRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The Investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by the study procedure(s). 
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monito ring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor. 
• Patients who experience an ongoing SAE or an  AESI with immediate notification, at the 
pre-specified study end-date , should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death 
and related data will be collected. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be re corded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI.

10.4.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after 
approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay. 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations  were performed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure  that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's 
identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document 
provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded  in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant 
medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by fax or e- mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge. In addition, ev ery effort should be made to further 
document any SAE that is fatal or life threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
• A back-up plan (using a paper CRF process) is available and should be used when the 
e-CRF system does not work. 
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by him/her  to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 86 10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IMP (ie, a Serious 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction [SUS AR]), to the regulatory authorities, 
Institutional Review Boards / Institutional Ethics Committees (IRBs/IECs) as appropriate 
and to the Investigators. 
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the regulatory authorities, according to local regulations. 
In this study exacerbations of asthma, as pre-existing condition, will be considered expected for purposes of regulatory reporting, unless the event is life-threatening or with fatal outcome (see the Investigator’s Brochure). 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol 
will be considered unexpected. The Sponsor will report all safety  observations made during the conduct of the trial in the CSR. 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
During the study, all patients will be closely monitored.  In addition, any problems related to dupilumab injection administration should be documented in 
the patient’s home dosing diary and in the specific e-CRF pages for local injection reactions 
recording. 
10.6.1 Hypersensitivity  
Allergic reaction is a potential risk associated with the administration of most therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies. 
Allergic reactions may be defined as an immunolog ically mediated response to a pharmaceutical 
and/or formulation agent in a sensitized person. Si gns and symptoms are often experienced during 
or shortly after therapeutic administration. Anaphy laxis may represent the most severe form of 
allergic reactions; see Appendix H “Definition of Anaphylaxis”, which describes the clinical 
criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Patients should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each study-site administered 
investigational product administr ation for any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. 
Trained personnel and medications s hould be available to treat anaphylaxis or any severe allergic 
reaction if it occurs. Furthermore, the patients will be advised, when the IMP is administered at 
home, to self-monitor for potential signs and symptoms that may suggest a hypersensitive reaction for 30 minutes after administration.

SAR231893-LTS12551 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 87 Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require treatment 
must be reported as an AESI (within 24 hours, for further details, see AESI definition in 
Section 10.4.1.3) and study medication must be permanently discontinued. ADA and PK samples will be collected near the onset and resolution of the AESI for any additional analysis. 
10.6.2  Severe injection site reactions 
Based on the SC mode of administr ation of high doses of protei n and on a higher incidence of 
local injection site reactions observed at the hi ghest dose level (300 mg weekly) severe injection 
site reactions are considered as a potential risk. Patients who experience an injection site reaction 
must be closely monitored for the possibility of a more intense injection site reaction with a future injection. Any severe injection reaction that last s over 24 hours will be reported as an AESI with 
immediate notification. ADA and PK samples will be collected near  the onset and resolution of 
the AESI for any additional analysis. 
Prophylactic treatment/premedication for an injection site reaction is not permitted. 
10.6.3 Infections 
Some biologic therapies have been associated with an increased risk of infection, including 
opportunistic infection. As a precautionary measur e, the Investigator is required to carefully 
monitor for any signs or symptoms of infection such as, but not limited to, increased body 
temperature, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, dy spnea, pulmonary infiltra tes, or serious febrile 
systemic illness. 
Infections with a diversity of helminthic parasites e licit eosinophilia via stimulation of Th2-like 
lymphocyte responses. The Th2 response is characterized by production of IL-4, IL-13 and IL-5, 
subsequently generating IgG1 a nd IgE-secreting cells, and elic iting eosinophilia. The eosinophilic 
response to helminths is determined both by the host's immune response and by the parasite, including its distribution, migration, and developm ent within the infected host. Since dupilumab 
binds to IL-4R α, preventing IL-4 and IL-13 binding and ac tivation of their respective receptors, it 
inhibits Th2 cytokine production. Therefore, pa tients treated with dupilumab may potentially have 
an increased risk of parasitic infection. 
In order to minimize this risk, any patient with an active parasitic infection should be excluded 
from the study. Similarly, patients with suspected parasitic infection, or those at high risk of 
parasitic infection are also excluded, unless clinical and (if necessary) laboratory assessments 
have ruled out active infection before enrollment. During the study, appearance of signs or symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cough, diarrh ea, fever, fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly) that 
could be associated with a parasitic infection should be carefully evaluated; especially if there is a history of parasitic exposure through recent travel to/or residence in endemic areas, particularly when conditions are conducive to infection (eg, ex tended stay, rural or slum areas, lack of running 
water, consumption of uncooke d, undercooked, or otherwise potentially contaminated food, close 
contact with carriers and vector s, etc). Subsequent medical a ssessments (eg, stool exam, blood 
tests, etc) must be performed in  order to rule out parasitic in fection/infestation. Patients with

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 88 confirmed parasitic inf ections during the study should be reported as AESI with immediate 
notification. 
Infections defined in Section 10.4.1.3  should be reported as AESIs within 24 hours. 
A complete diagnostic work-up shoul d be performed (ie, cultures, histopathological or cytological 
evaluation, antigen detection and serum antibody titers). Patients should be referred to an 
infectious disease specialist, if deemed necessary, for diagnostic wo rk up and appropriate 
treatment: 
• Infections or infestations that do not res pond to medical treatment should have study IMP 
discontinued until the infection is resolved. 
• For any opportunistic infection, such as TB or other infections whose nature or course may 
suggest an immunocompromised status (See Appendix I ), patients must be permanently 
discontinued from IMP. 
10.6.4 Elevated liver function tests 
No preclinical or clinical data have suggested any hepatic toxi city of dupilumab; however, as 
general consideration of clini cal development, the administr ation of immunosuppressant or 
immunomodulating agents may represent an addi tional risk factor for hepatotoxicity.  
In order to closely follow liver function tests (LFT), assessment of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and ALP are measured as part of the clinical laboratory testing. Clinical laboratory testing also includes a hepatitis screen for HBsAg, HBcAb-IgM, HCVAb. Patients who are total-HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative must undergo HBV DNA testing to determine 
eligibility. Furthermore, it is recommended that patients who are receiving potentially 
immunosuppressive therapy and are HBcAb positive and HBV DNA negative undergo 
surveillance HBV DNA every 1 to 3 months depe nding upon the individual potential therapeutic 
risk and comorbidities. If necessary, a hepatologi st should be consulted on a case-by-case basis.  
Note: Japanese patient s who have rolled over from DRI 12544 study should be retested for 
hepatitis B (HBsAg, HBsAb, and HBcAb) after Visit 1, at any time during the LTS12551 study 
via the earliest scheduled study visit, after IRB approval for Local Amendment 03 (Japan). Japanese patients with HBsAg negative and HBsAb positive at any time during the parent study or at the additional test due to  Local Amendment 03 (Japan) do not need to discontinue the study. 
In Japan (or other countries/regions if there is local regulatory requirement), hepatitis B viral load (HBV DNA) will be tested for patients who are HBsAg negative and HBsAb positive
 at screening 
during the parent study or at the additional test due to Local Amendment 03 (Japan).  
Guidance for the investigation of elevated LFTs is provided in Appendix D .

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of 
dupilumab in patients with asthma who participated in previous dupilumab asthma clinical trials. Hence, the maximal number of patients to participate in this extension study will be the number corresponding to the total randomized in those studies. 
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
Screened patients are defined as any patients who signed the informed consent form. 
Enrolled patients consist of all th e patients who signed informed consent and had a treatment kit 
number allocated and recorded in IVRS/IWRS data base, and regardless of whether the treatment 
kit was used or not.  The safety population consists of the patients who act ually received at least one dose or part of a 
dose of dupilumab in the LTS12551 study. 
11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Efficacy populations 
Efficacy population is the same as the safety population. 
11.3.2 Safety population 
The primary analysis population is the safety popula tion, which is defined as all patients who have 
actually received at least one dose or part of  a dose of dupilumab in the LTS12551 study.  
The treatment-emergent period is  defined as the time from the first dose of dupilumab in 
LTS12551 up to the last dose of dupilumab plus 2 w eeks (corresponding to one dose interval) plus 
12 weeks (follow-up period duration). The pre-treatment period is defined as the time from the 
starting of AE reporting in LTS12551 study up to the first dose of dupilumab in LTS12551.

11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
Extent of study treatment exposure and complia nce will be summarized on the safety population. 
11.4.1.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
Duration of exposure to IMP is defined as: last  dose date – first dose date of dupilumab + dose 
interval, regardless of unplanned intermittent discontinuations. Duration of exposure will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviati on (SD), median, minimum 
and maximum. 
11.4.1.2 Compliance 
A given administration of IMP will be considered "noncompliant" if  the patient did not take the 
planned dose of treatment as required by the protocol. No imputation will be made for patients with missing or incomplete data.  
Percentage of compliance for a pa tient will be defined as 100 x (the  number of administrations the 
patient was compliant divided by the total number of administrati ons the patient was planned to 
take during the tr eatment period).  
Treatment compliance will be summarized descri ptively (number, mean, SD, median, minimum 
and maximum). The percentage of patients with compliance <80% will be summarized. 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
There will be no confirmatory analysis for the efficacy variables. All analyses will be done 
descriptively on the safety population in observed case, as appropriate. The baseline value for the 
applicable efficacy parameters is the original baseline from the parent studies. 
For the continuous efficacy variables, descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, median, minimum 
and maximum) will be presented for the parameter and its change from baseline over visits. In addition, a figure of mean change from baseline (with corresponding standard error) will be presented for the continuous efficacy parameter over visits.

applicable safety parameters is the or iginal baseline from the parent studies. 
11.4.3.1 Adverse events 
Adverse event reported in this study will be coded using the version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) in effect at sanofi at the time of database lock. Adverse events occurred during the treatment emergent period will be considered as TEAE. 
11.4.3.1.1  Treatment-emergent adverse events  
Treatment-emergent AE incidence tables will be presented by system organ class (SOC) (sorted by internationally agreed order), high level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred term (PT) sorted in alphabetical orde r, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients 
experiencing a TEAE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted 
only once in the tables. The denominator is base d on the total number of patients in the safety 
population.  
The proportion of patients with at least one  TEAE, serious TEAE and TEAE leading to 
discontinuation of the study will be tabulated. In addition TEAEs will be described according to 
maximum intensity and relation to the study drug. Adverse events that are not treatment-emergent will be summarized separately. 
11.4.3.1.2  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The following summaries will be generated: 
• Incidence of each AESI will be tabulated.  
• The time-to-first event analyzed using Ka plan-Meier methods and displayed as  
Kaplan-Meier plots (cumulative incidence [%] versus time based on Kaplan-Meier estimates) will be provided to depict the course of onset over time. Number of treatment-emergent AESIs per 100 patient-years (total number of events adjusted for the 
total duration of exposure) will be presented by decreasing incidence of PT. 
• An overview summary of the number (%) of patients with: 
- Any TEAE. 
- Any serious AE (regardless of treatment-emergent status).

nsLabeling/ucm080499.htm  (2) CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic range refers to drugs whose exposure-response 
relationship indicates that small changes in their exposure levels by the concomitant use of CYP inhibitors or inducers may lead to either serious sa fety concerns (eg, Torsades de Pointes) or loss 
of therapeutic effect.  (3) Because a number of CYP3A substrates (eg, dar unavir, maraviroc) are also substrates of P-gp, 
the observed increase in exposure could be due  to inhibition of both CYP3A and P-gp.

 ALT > 3 ULN
Monitor LFTs every 72 hoursALT ≤ 5 ULN ALT > 3 ULN &
Total Bilirubin > 2 ULN 
Permanent Discontinuation of IMPALT > 5 ULN 
In ANY CASE, FOLLOW the instructions listed in the box below: 
1. INFORM the Site Monitor who will forward the information to the Study Manager
2. INVESTIGATE specifically for malaise with or without loss of consciousness, dizziness, and/or 
hypotension and/or episode of arrhythmia in the previous 72 hours; rule out muscular injury
3. PERFORM the following tests:
- LFTs: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total and conjugated bilirubin and prothrombin time / INR
- CPK, serum creatinine, complete blood count- Anti-HAV IgM, anti-HBc IgM, (HBV-DNA if clinically indicated), anti-HCV and HCV RNA, anti-
CMV IgM and anti-HEV IgM antibodies
- Depending on the clinical context, check for recent infection with EBV, herpes viruses, and toxoplasma- Hepatobiliary ultrasonography (or other imaging investigations if needed)
4. CONSIDER Auto-antibodies: antinuclear, anti-DNA, anti-smooth muscle, anti-LKM
5. CONSIDER consulting with hepatologist
6. CONSIDER patient hospitalisation if INR>2 (or PT<50%) and/or central nervous system disburbances 
suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
7. MONITOR LFTs after discontinuation of IMP:
-As closely as possible (or every 48 hours) until stabilization, then every 2 weeks until return to 
normal/baseline or clinical resolution.
8. FREEZE serum sample (5ml x 2)
9. In case of SUSPICION of GILBERT Syndrome, a DNA diagnostic test should be doneC OMPL ETE  the specific C RF forms 
for „ALT I ncrease” and inform t he Monitoring Team within 24 hours
Confirm ALT > 3 ULN
Retest within 72 hours of initial sample*
IMP administration can be continued as 
long as – under close monitoring –
conditions for permanent 
discontinuation or temporary 
interruption per protocol are not metINCREASE IN ALT
 
*If unable to retest in 72 hours, use original lab results to decide on further reporting/monitoring/discontinuation.  
Note: 
• “Baseline” refers to ALT sampled at baseline visit; or if baseline value unavailable, to the latest ALT sampled before the 
baseline visit. The algorithm does not apply to t he instances of increase in ALT during screening. 
• See Section 10.4  for guidance on safety reporting. 
• Normalization is defined as ≤ULN or baseline value, if baseline value is >ULN.

• Transaminases + Total and conjugated bilirubin• Myoglobin (serum and urines)
- COLLECT/STORE one sample following handling proced ures described in PK sections (for 
studies with PK sampling) and freeze one serum sample (5  mL) on Day 1 (cessation of 
investigational me dicinal product). 
- INTERVIEW the patient about a recent in tensive muscular effort, trauma, convulsions , electrical 
injury, injury or stress to the skeletal muscle, multiple intramuscular inj ections, recent surgery, 
concomitant medica tions, consumption of alcohol, morphine, cocaine.
- SEARCH for alternative causes to cardiac or muscular toxicity, ie: stroke, pulmonary infarction, 
dermatomyositis or polymyositis, convulsions, hypothyroidism, delirium tremens, muscular dystrophies.
If either the cardiac origin or the 
rhabdomyolysis is confirmed or if CPK 
> 10 ULN:
1. DISCONTINUE Investigational 
Medicinal Product administration
2. MONITOR CPK every 3 days for the 
first week then once weekly until return 
to normal or for at least 3 months
3. HOSPITALIZATION should be 
consideredIf the cardiac origin or the rhabdomyolysis is 
ruled out and if CPK ≤10 ULN:
MONITOR CPK every 3 days for the first week 
then once weekly until return to normal or for at least 3 monthsMuscular symptoms (mya lgia, pain, weakness, 
dark urines)Systematic CPK assessment as per 
protocol
Perform CPKSUSPICION OF RHABDOMYOLYSIS
 
Suspicion of rhabdomyolysis is to be recorded as AE only if at least one of the criteria in the 
General guidelines for reporting AEs in Section 10.4.2 is met.

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
Various management options for free flap donor sites that require split thickness skin grafting exist. 
None has proven superior from both a patient care and a cost standpoint. Major complications occurring at these surgical sites include wound breakdown, tendon exposure, and loss of function. We seek to investigate the use of the PICO single- use negative pressure wo und therapy device in these 
surgical sites and determine if it can yield superior results to simpler methods.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Many studies have addressed the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in free flap donor sites with mixed results. It is well  established that NPWT is safe and causes no harm, and no delay in 
healing. A previous study performed at UAB showed that NPWT in complex Head & Neck Surgery reconstruction is safe, including free flap donor sites. There have been studies that state the ra te of 
tendon exposure is lower with NPWT in free flap donor sites, and studies that conclude there is no difference in complication rates. Current clinical practice is varied, often within a single institution.  
 
While no studies of NPWT in free flap donor sites have noted inferior results with its use, a primary 
reason cited for not using it is cost. Traditional NPWT using canister- based vacuum devices adds 
significant cost. The PICO single -use NPWT device (Smith & Nephew) is a relatively inexpensive, low-
profile dressing that does not require attachment to an external canister. It is battery -powered and 
disposable. Empiric use on our patients undergoing split -thickness skin -grafting to free flap donor sites 
shows good results with minimal intra- operative ef fort compared to traditional bandaging. We would 
like to prospectively investigate the use of this low- cost NPWT device and compare it directly to the 
traditional post -op dressing method.

  3 2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
All of the devices  to be used in this study are FDA -cleared , commercially available, and will be used for 
their approv ed indications.  
 
• Risks associated with the PICO NPWT device : Per the device labeling, PICO not intended for use 
with complex wounds with e xtensive undermining or tunneling, or wounds that exceed 25% of 
the dressing pad area . It is not intended for use with patients with malignancy in the wound bed 
or margins; previously confirmed or untreated osteomyelitis; non -enteric and unexplored 
fistula; use on necrotic tissue with eschar present; use over exposed blood vessels, nerves, or 
organs; exposed anastomotic sites. There is a small risk of superficial pain at the application site 
and with removal of this device.  
 
• Risks associated with xeroform dressing:  Per the device labeling, x eroform petrolatum dressing 
is not labeled for use with third degree burns; as having an accelerating effect on the rate of 
wound healing or epithelization; as a long- term, permanent, or no change -dressi ng, or as an 
artificial (synthetic) skin; as a treatment or cure for any type of wound.  There is a small risk of 
superficial pain with  removal  of this device . 
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
All of the devices  to be used in this study are FDA -cleared and will be used for their approv ed 
indications.  
 
• Benefits associated with the PICO NPWT device : Per the device labeling, PICO is indicated for 
patients who would benefit from a suction device (negative pressure wound therapy) as it may 
promote wound healing via removal of low to moderate levels of exudate and infectious 
materials. Appropriate wound  types include chronic, acute, traumatic, subacute and dehisced 
wounds, partial -thickness burns, diabetic or pressure ulcers, flaps and grafts, and closed surgical 
incisions . 
• Benefits  associated with xeroform dressing:  Per the device labeling, x eroform petrolatum 
dressing is  intended for use as a primary contact layer in dressing wounds such as lacerations,  
skin graft recipient sites, newly sutured  wounds, abrasions, and minor or partial thickness burns. 
It may a lso be used as an  initial layer in dressing surgical wounds  with light exudate.

Single -Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites  Version 1.0 
 21 Nov 2017 
  6 randomization schedule. The appropriate number and associated treatment for the next subject will 
only be allocated when entry of that subject to the randomized part of the trial has been confirmed.  
 
5.3 STUDY INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE  
Define how adherence to the protocol (e.g., administration of study intervention, use of device, ) will be 
assessed, and verified (if applicable, e.g., plasma assays , electronic monitoring devices, daily diaries ). 
Include a discussion of what documents are mandatory to comple te (e.g., participant drug log) and what 
source documents/records will be used to calculate study intervention compliance.   
 
For both the Treatment Group and the Control Group , the dressings will remain in place until post -op 
day (POD) #5. Following dressing removal on POD #5, participants in both groups will be given identical wound management instructions. Photographs of each participant’s healing wound will be obtained on 
POD #5 (+1 day) and on their first post -op clinic visit, approximately POD #14 -21, and at POD #30 (+7 
days). Participants who do not come to their designated follow -up appointments will be dropped from 
the dataset.  
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PAR TICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
 
6.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
Discontinuation from the study intervention  (PICO vs xeroform dressing)  does not mean discontinuation 
from the study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated  by the study 
protocol.   If a clinically sig nificant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from 
baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in 
participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse 
event (AE).  
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• Wound photograph  
• Assessment of adverse events  
• Assessment of concomitant medications  
 
6.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation  in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant  
Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study 
intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized an d 
receive the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued  from the 
study  will not be replaced.  
Single -Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites  Version 1.0 
 21 Nov 2017 
  7 6.3 LOST TO FOLLOW- UP 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails  to return for 2 scheduled visits and is 
unable to be contacted by the study site  staff.  
 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will  attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit and counsel  the 
participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the 
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). 
These contact attempts should be documented in the participant ’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up.

7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
7.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).]  
 
7.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investiga tor or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• a life-threatening adverse event (of note, the term “life- threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• inpati ent hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug depe ndency or drug abuse.  
 
7.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
7.2.3.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AE s) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severi ty.  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
Single -Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites  Version 1.0 
 21 Nov 2017 
  9 • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
 
7.2.3.2  RELATI ONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention  assessed  by the clinician who 
examines and evaluates the participant  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certai nty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE , or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonab le possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset,  or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
7.2.3.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
7.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an  adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the 
training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as a n AE.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each episode.  
 
The S tudy Coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.

7.2.5  ADVERSE EVENT AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All serious adverse events must be reported to the IRB according to regulatory requirements. The 
Principal Investigator will immediately report to the sponsor any serious adverse event, whether or not 
considered study intervention related, including those listed in the protocol or package insert and must 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evi dence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until s atisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator deems the event to be chronic or the subject is stable. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Primary Endpoint(s): Progression of wound healing, as measured by comparison of photographs of all 
subject wounds taken at post -operative Day 5, post -operative Day 14 -21, and post -operative Day 30. 
Percentage skin graft take will be evaluated on Day 30 by blinded, independent raters.  
 
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
Our statistics indicate that assuming an 80% graft take, the number of patients needed for an appropriately powered study (80%) would be 44 patients in each group ; however, we p lan to only 
recruit 20 participants total, making this more of a pilot study to see if it’s worthwhile to pursue a larger, prospective randomized controlled trial, given the costs associated with the devices to be used in this 
study.

  11 Review Board ( IRB)-approved and the participant  will be asked to read and review the document. T he 
investigator will explain the research study to the participant  and answer any questions that may arise. 
A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the  particip ant’s comprehension of the 
purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions 
prior to signing.  The participant s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or 
surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant  will sign the informed 
consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  Participant s must be 
informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the in formed consent document will be given to the participant s for their records. 
The informed consent process will be conducted and  documented in the source document (including the 
date), and the form signed, before the participan t undergoes any study -specific  procedures.  The rights 
and welfare of the participant s will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their 
medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study.  
9.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This stud y may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to regulatory autho rities.  If the study is prematurely 
terminated or suspended, the  Principal Investigator ( PI) will promptly inform study participants, the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB), and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or 
suspension.  Stud y participants will be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes to study 
visit schedule.  
  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that  the primary endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futilit y 
 Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed , 
and satisfy the IRB.  
 
9.1.3  CONFIDENTIALITY  AND PRIVACY   
Participant  confidentiality  and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, their 
staff, and the sponsor(s) and their intervention s. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of 
biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relatin g to participan ts. 
Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in 
strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.   All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.

  12 Representatives of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) may inspect all documents and records required 
to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or 
hospital) the participant s in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
 
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use 
during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as 
long a period as dictated by the reviewing  IRB and/or  institutional policie s. 
 
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will be transmitted to and stored at the Department of Otolaryngology research office. This will not include 
the pa rticipant’s contact or identifying information. Rather, individual participants and their research 
data will be identified by a unique study identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by clinical sites and by research sta ff will be secured and password 
protected.  
 
9.1.4  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
The site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data collection, documentation  and 
completion.  Quality control (QC) procedures will be completed by the Data Manager during data entry 
into the appropriate CRF. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the Study 
Coordinator for clarification/resolution.  
 
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is 
conducted and data are generated are collected, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation G ood Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
 The site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the 
purpose of monitoring and inspection by local and regulatory authorities
 
 
9.1.5  DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORD  KEEPING   
 
9.1.5.1  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the 
Principal I nvestigator. The Principal In vestigator is responsible  for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported . 
 All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.    Hardc opies of source document  worksheets for recording data for each participant  enrolled in the study.

  13 A protocol devia tion is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) , or Manual of Procedures ( MOP) requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant , the investig ator, or the study site staff. As a 
result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP :  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
 It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations within 10 working days of identificatio n of the protocol deviation.  Protocol deviations must 
be sent to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) per their policies. The Principal Investigator is 
responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements.

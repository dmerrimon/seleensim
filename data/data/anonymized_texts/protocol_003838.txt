Post-operative constipation is a well-known concern among patients under going pelvic 
reconstructive sur gery. A retrospective study reviewing all patient-initiated telephone calls in the 
postoperative period after pelvic reconstructive sur gery found the most frequent concern among 
patients to be constipation (Ramaseshan, 2018). There are various strategies for managing post 
operative constipation but few of these are evidence-based. Strategies typically involve stool
softeners, laxatives, stool bulking agents or a combination of these medications.
The current evidence has focused on postoperative medications to improve time to first bowel
movement. A study by Patel et al. (2010) found that senna-docusate decreases time to first 
bowel movement postoperatively when compared to placebo in patients under going pelvic 
reconstructive sur gery. Another study examined the ef fect of a standardized post-operative 
bowel regimen of over -the-counter medications including docusate, Miralax, fiber wafers and 
Bisacodyl suppositories and found minimal dif ferences between the combination of medications 
compared to docusate alone (McNanley , 2012).
There has been an increased attention placed on fiber -containing regimens for perioperative
bowel management. It is well-documented that the Western diet is low in fiber and most adult 
women do not meet the recommended consumption of 25g of fiber per day . Moreover , women 
with pelvic or gan prolapse are at higher risk for constipation than controls. One study suggested 
that this increased risk could partially be explained by lower intake of dietary insoluble fiber in
women with prolapse when compared to controls (Arya et al., 2005).
An alternative approach to postoperative constipation involves consideration of the preoperative
period. There is an increasing interest in preoperative optimization and preparation for sur gery. 
There is limited information regarding the ef fect of preoperative therapies and their ef fect on 
postoperative constipation. One study examined the ef fect of pre-operative mechanical bowel 
preparation on postoperative return to bowel function and found no dif ference between the 
intervention and control group (Ballard et al., 2015). However , mechanical bowel preparation is 
no longer recommended prior to benign gynecologic sur gery. Thus far , there have been no 
studies examining the use of pre-operative fiber supplementation prior to pelvic reconstructive
surgery to improve time to first bowel movement after sur gery and pain associated with first 
bowel movement. Fiber may be of benefit as it appears to have a regulating ef fect on bowel 
movements.

Subjects will be enrolled from one week before their sur gery until 6 weeks after sur gery.
Our urogynecology department had approximately 90 postoperative admissions over 12 months
(from October 2017 to October 2018). Given this trend, we anticipate approximately 20-24
months to recruit 84 patients.
Primary analysis will be completed within 6 months after enrollment is completed.

The primary outcome is the time to first bowel movement among those who receive
preoperative fiber supplementation and those who do not.
The secondary outcome is pain associated with first bowel movement.
We also plan to perform an interval analysis after 50% of subjects have completed their sur gery
to evaluate postoperative bowel function. If a statistically significant dif ference (p<0.01) is found 
on this analysis, we will terminate the study .

Study design and randomization
This study is a randomized trial. We were unable to find a suitable placebo that had the
same properties as the psyllium fiber supplementation, and thus we will compare
psyllium fiber supplementation to our standard of care, which is no bowel regimen before
surgery. Both groups will receive the routine postoperative bowel regimen of fered to all 
patients on the urogynecology service.
Subjects will be screened for eligibility using inclusion and exclusion criteria in our
urogynecology clinic after prolapse sur gery has been scheduled. Once a patient provides 
informed consent for the sur gical procedure, she will be invited to participate in this 
study . Once the subject has consented to participate in the study , baseline data will be 
gathered. Study assignment will be revealed using sequentially numbered sealed opaque
envelopes. Randomization will be performed using software and a block randomization
scheme to yield a 50% chance of receiving the preoperative fiber supplementation. Those 
assigned to the intervention group will receive a 7-day supply of fiber supplementation to
be taken before sur gery. The fiber will be procured, distributed and managed by the 
investigational drug pharmacy .
Neither the patient nor the provider will be blinded to the allocation of groups. However ,
our statistician will be blinded to allocation for the data analysis
Psyllium fiber is a commonly used and naturally occurring dietary supplement that is
FDA-approved. It is available over -the-counter .
Surgery:
On the day of sur gery, we will collect information from the patient about their last bowel
movement as well as if they were able to adhere to the fiber regimen, had they been allocated to
that group. Prolapse sur gery will be performed in the usual manner . There will be no changes to 
the sur gical technique for the purposes of the study .
Subjects will receive routine perioperative and postoperative care for their scheduled
surgery. The study intervention will require postoperative data collection including the 
gathering of PHI, a 5-day bowel diary and recording of post-operative medications.
Postoperative car e:
Subjects will under go routine postoperative care as inpatients and outpatients and have 
routine follow-up, including a postoperative evaluation at 2 and 6 weeks. Information on
any postoperative complications will also be collected, such as severe constipation,
infection, urinary tract infection. During our routine 1 week follow up phone call that all
patients get, data regarding the primary outcome will be collected. At their 2 week 
postoperative visit, they will be asked to fill out a validated questionnaire regarding
bowel function.
Administration of bowel function-r elated surveys:
1. Validated questionnaires related to bowel function and pain scores will be administered at
two time points:
(a) At the patient’ s preoperative visit
(b) At their routine 2 week postoperative visit, they will submit their 5-day bowel diary . The 
primary outcome measures will also be gathered via telephone call to occur 1 week after
surgery. At this visit, they will also complete a validated questionnaire regarding bowel 
function.

13. Data Analysis and Management* 
Previous studies have found that the average time to first bowel movement ranges between 64
hours – 81 hours
2-5
. Our quality data finds time to
first bowel movement averaging
approximately 72 hours. Most studies have tar geted a 24 hour decrease in time to first bowel 
movement. We plan to tar get a similar dif ference as we feel this is a clinically significant 
difference in the patient’ s postoperative recovery period. Using a Pearson chi-squared test with a 
significance level of 5% and power of 80%, this yields 35 patients per arm (70 patients total).
Assuming a 20% drop-out rate, we seek to recruit 84 patients.
Continuous measures will be compared using the Student’ s t-test. Standard statistical programs
(SAS, SPSS, and ST ATA) will be used to perform these tests.

The IDS will verify that study drugs supplies are received intact, at the appropriate temperatures,
and in the correct amounts from the study drug supplier .
Study drug will be dispensed only by prescription. Research staf f will transfer the prepared
study medication from the pharmacy to the Urogynecology clinic on West 4
th
floor of UMass
Memorial to give to the subject. The study drug will not be used for reasons other than that 
described in the protocol. Attached to this protocol is an informational sheet regarding fiber 
supplementation.
Psyllium fiber supplement is generally well tolerated. It can cause bloating and abdominal
discomfort. Subjects will be advised to stop the fiber if they develop symptoms such as
abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. All subjects will have access to our of fice and an on-call 
physician should any medication side ef fects or adverse reactions develop.
If any adverse event were to arise, they would be evaluated by the on-call physician.
We will do an interval analysis of the primary outcome once 50% of subjects have completed the
study . If a statistically significant dif ference (p<0.01) is found in favor of psyllium fiber 
supplementation, we will terminate the study and of fer preoperative psyllium fiber 
supplementation to all our patients.

Psyllium fiber is an over -the-counter dietary supplement that is widely available and used
by millions of individuals across the country . We believe this study poses minimal risk  to 
subjects. The risks associated with fiber supplementation include abdominal cramping, 
bloating, and change in bowel habits. Both groups will otherwise receive the routine
postoperative care regularly given to our patients.
There is no economic risk to the patient, as we will provide the study medication.
There is a risk of unauthorized disclosure of protected health information. The datasheets
will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked of fice in the administrative of fices of the 
division on Jaquith 2. The data will be entered into a de-identified, password protected

ETTING 
Subjects will be identified and recruited in the urogynecology clinic at UMass Memorial on West
4
th
floor at the time of their pre-operative visit.
At this visit, the patients will be consented, and
they will also fill out the pre-operative questionnaire. At this time, they will also be randomized
to standard of care versus intervention. The urogynecology division has two full-time designated 
surgeons (including the PI) and both will participate in the study . In addition, the department 
fellows and nurse practitioner will work as co-PI and study assistants. This comprises the team 
who will recruit subjects and obtain intraoperative and postoperative study data.
Data entry and analysis will be performed in the administrative of fices of the division on
Jaquith 2 in UMass Memorial.
There will be no community advisory board, and this research will not be conducted outside of

Our power calculation, as detailed previously in question 13, requires 70 total subjects (35 per
arm). Assuming a 20% drop-out rate, we seek to recruit 84 patients.
Our urogynecology 
department had approximately 90 postoperative admissions over 12 months (from October
2017
to October 2018). Given this trend, we anticipate approximately 20-24 months to recruit
84 subjects for the study .
All subjects will be identified and recruited through the urogynecology clinic, at the clinic site
previously mentioned in question 22, after prolapse sur gery has been scheduled. Our two full 
time sur geons (including the PI) will both participate in the study , as well as the department 
fellows—therefore, this yields access to every sur gical urogynecology patient. The study team 
will screen potential subjects using inclusion and exclusion criteria at their preoperative visit,
since this routinely includes a review of the patient’ s medical history . No identifiers will be 
recorded during screening. Once eligibility has been determined, potential subjects will be
offered to participate in the study by their sur geon only after sur gical consent has been discussed 
and obtained for the patient’ s surgery. Clinical staf f will not be involved in the recruitment 
process. The study will be reviewed in detail and ample opportunity for questions will be given. 
The opportunity to decline participation will also be given, and no information on these patients
will be recorded for this study . An un-identified tally will be recorded counting screened patients 
who were “ineligible” or “declined”. For women agreeing to participation, informed written
consent will be obtained.
There will be no payment to subjects in the study .

Data on subjects will be stored under a study participant ID number to ensure
confidentiality . This data will be stored initially as a hard copy in a locked closet in a 
locked of fice until the scheduled sur gery occurs and perioperative data is collected. Study 
data will be collected only under the study participant ID number , and later transcribed 
on a monthly basis into a de-identified Redcap database by the study assistants. This 
database is password protected on the secure Redcap server . At that point, completed 
study charts will be stored in the locked closet. Only the PI and study assistants have
access to this key . The document that links the study participant ID number to patient 
identifiers (medical record number) will be stored in a separate locked filing cabinet in a
different departmental locked of fice. This will also be transcribed to a secure Redcap 
server . Once the study is published, the subject key will be disposed of via a HIP AA

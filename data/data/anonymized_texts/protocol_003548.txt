Outreach Methods Study Protocol  
Version 1.1, 1 /14/22  
pg. 2 1. Objective  
Our objective is to determine the effectiveness of varied outreach methods (e.g. automated reminder calls/text 
messages with or without personalized calls/texts, MyChart messaging) to children age 12 -14 mon ths, 4 years old, 
or 6-17 years old who are due for a WCC visit and don’t have one scheduled in the next 45 days on the outcomes of 
appointment scheduling, appointment completion, and receipt of the MMR vaccination.  
 
Background  
The Cincinnati Children’s Ho spital Medical Center Primary Care offices serve as the medical home for over 33,000 
children.  The Pediatric Primary Care Center (PPCC), Hopple Street Health Center (HPC) and Fairfield Primary 
Care (FPC) serves an underserved population.  Annually, these practices provide over 60,000 visits.  Traditional 
outreach efforts in these offices have included reminder phone calls and/or texts when patients were overdue for 
well child care (WCC).  These efforts were time and resource intensive, as they required per sonnel to manually 
complete and document attempts. Additionally, due to high resource needs to accomplish such efforts, there has 
been no outreach to those 6 years and older.  
 
Numerous studies exist speaking to the efficacy of automated reminder (i.e. noti fying parents of needed 
immunizations) and recall (i.e. notifying parents of overdue immunizations) systems, including text messaging 
systems.1,2,3  Other studies show that the com bination of texting and calls proves even more successful in reaching 
patients.3 These systems are more cost effective and efficient.  Differences in the timing of reminders to schedule, as 
well as the message itself, has been shown to make  a difference in the outcomes of reaching patients or scheduling 
appointments.4 However, there remains a need for research that identifies the degree to which combinations of 
patient reminder systems improve outcomes, especially the outcome of on -time immunization, and how these 
approaches differ by age of child.1 
 
Following the COVID -19 pandemic shut -down in which thousands of well child appointments were cancelled or 
delayed, the imp ortance of a systematic outreach process became more critical.  The traditional process is non -
standardized and the efficacy of the work is both unknown and expensive.  Our objective is to determine the 
effectiveness of varied outreach methods (e.g. automa ted reminder calls/text messages with or without personalized 
calls/texts, MyChart messaging) to children age 12 -14 months, 4 years old, or 6 -17 years old who are due for a 
WCC visit and don’t have one scheduled in the next 45 days on the outcomes of appoi ntment scheduling, 
appointment completion, and receipt of the MMR vaccination.  
2. Design/Method  
To achieve our objective, we will conduct a 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial.  Randomization is justified 
because 1) it is a rigorous approach to answer our question and 2) we do not have the resources or appointment 
availability to personally contact every patient who is eligible and have them schedule immediately.  
 
Patient Population :  
Patients are eligible for inclusion in this study if they are in one of four eligible groups:  
12-14 months AND  4 years AND  
• doesn’t have a well visit scheduled 
in the next 45 days  
• have not yet received 12 -month 
immunizations  
• have English and/or Spanish as 
preferred language  • doesn’t have a well visit scheduled 
in the next 45 days  
• has not had a well child visit in 365 
days 
• have English and/or Spanish as 
preferred language  
 
6-11 years AND  12-17 years AND  
• doesn’t h ave a well visit scheduled 
in the next 45 days  
• has not had a well child visit > 365 
days  • doesn’t have a well visit scheduled 
in the next 45 days  
• has not had a well child visit in 365 
days

Automated Message : Parents indicate their preferred mode of reminder (e.g. call or text message) when they 
schedule appointments.  Cincinnati Children’s uses a HIPAA compliant platform called TeleVox to send automated 
calls and text reminders to parents according to their preferences which are recorded in the Electronic Health Record 
(EHR).

Response variables (outcomes) :  
• Appointment was scheduled  within 2 weeks of intervention (Y/N) (date of actual appointment may be 
greater than 2 weeks from intervention)  
• Appointment was completed  within 8 weeks of intervention (Y/N). Appointment completed within 8 
weeks of randomization will be used for group wh o does not receive any intervention.  
• (Primary Outcome) Receipt of MMR by 15 months of age or receipt of 2nd MMR dose by 3 months after 
randomization (Y/N)  
• Receipt of 1st COVID vaccination (ages 12 -17 years) within 8 weeks of first intervention (Y/N)  
• Family  member receipt of COVID vaccination in our health system within 8 weeks of first intervention  
 
Blocking : (controlling for factors that might influence the outcome)  
• Age (12 -14 months, 4 years)  
• Clinic location (PPC, HPC, FPC)  
 
Personal Contacts (12 -14 month s & 4 -year -olds) Trial:  
Randomization : Eligible patient will be identified by running a report in the electronic health record (EHR).  We 
will run this report, stratified by clinic location, and randomly assign patients into one of the four groups created  by 
our 2 X 2 design.  Groups will receive their assigned intervention in one of four successive weeks with the sequence 
randomly assigned (see table below).  
 
Replication : We will conduct a total of 3 trials, repeating the randomization procedure every 4 w eeks to identify 
children who become eligible:  Weeks 1 -4 = trial #1, weeks 5 -8 = trial #2, weeks 9 -12 = trial #3.

MyChart and Televox Trials (6 -17 years old):  
Randomization : Eligible patients  will be identified by running a report in the electronic health record (EHR).  We 
will run this report, stratified by clinic location, and randomly assign patients into one of the study groups as 
described above.  Groups will receive their assigned interv ention in one of four successive weeks with the sequence 
randomly assigned (see table below).  
 
We will randomize children who are eligible and implement interventions for each trial :  Weeks 1 -3 = Televox Trial

Of note, automated messages and/or personal contact attempts will not be completed if the parent schedules an 
appointment after being randomized but before receiving the intervention.  
 
Covariates for logistic regression :  (factors that might influence the outcome if not be balanced across groups)  
1. Child age at the time of randomization (rationale: visits are less frequent for children age 4 years)  
2. Parent preference for call vs. text mode of contact (rationale: calls may be more likely to get blocked than 
texts) 
3. Parent with activated MyChart account (Y/N) (rationale: not dependent on calling scheduling center to 
make appointment)  
4. Access to appointment: Number of days to 3rd next available appointment at patient’s clinic at time their 
first automated message is  sent 
5. Patient receipt of any past immunizations (Y/N) (rationale: vaccine refusing parents will be unlikely to 
change even if they return for well child check)

Power/Sample Size  
 
Personal Contacts (12 -14 month & 4 -year -olds) Trial:  
We based our hypotheses (see table, below) on a systematic review’s pooled estimates of effect size for automated 
messages and personalized calls finding 37% and 40% of children, respectively, completed immunizations.1 
Because of the significant cost involved in making personal contacts, the minimal difference in outcome that would 
make it wo rth the effort is high.   
 
Hypotheses  % of children who receive MMR by 15 
months of age  
 1 automated 
message sent  2 automated 
messages sent  
0 personal attempts  20% C 35% B 
1 personal attempt  50% A 65% AB 
 
We calculated sample size needed per group to detect a difference for each of the contrasts below with alpha of 0.05 
and power of 80%.  
 
Contrast  Sample Size per 
Group  
A vs C  36 
B vs C  136 
A vs. B  167 
A vs. AB  167 
B vs. AB  40 
C vs. AB  16 
 
To fully power the 2 X 2 factorial trail, we estimate needing 167 per group X 4 groups = 668 total subjects.  There 
are currently 712 children eligible for the study. More will become eligible every month so we expect to far exceed 
the required sample size  after 3 replications.  If needed, we could increase the number of replications of the trial to 
reach the targeted sample size.  We acknowledge that we are not powered to precisely estimate any interactions 
between interventions.  
 
MyChart Trial:  
In hypothesis testing for 0 message vs. 1 message vs. 2 messages, we will do the testing in a fixed sequence -  test 2 
messages vs. 0 message first, only if it is significant then test 2 messages vs. 1 message, thus the type I error rate of  
0.05 is retained. Since the hypothesis testing of 2 messages vs. 0 message would be considered easier to achieve 
than the hypothesis testing of 2 messages vs. 1 message,  the power analysis for this trial should be based on the 
design of (standard message vs.  tailored message) by (1 message vs. 2 messages). We based our hypotheses (see 
table, below) on previous work indicating approximately 20% WCC appointment completion on automated text 
reminders.  We anticipate that a tailored message increases the WCC appointment completion rate by another 10%.  
 
Hypotheses   % of children complete WCC within 8 
weeks  
 No message  1 automated 
message sent  2 automated 
messages sent  
Standard Message  2% 10% C 20% B 
Tailored Message  20% A 30% AB

Version 1.1, 1 /14/22  
pg. 8 We calculated sample size needed per group to detect a difference for each of the contrasts below with alpha of 0.05

A vs C  199 
B vs C  199 
A vs. AB  293 
B vs. AB  293 
C vs. AB  62 
 
We assume no difference between A vs. B and thus not consider powering the comparison between these two 
groups, but we will explore non -inferiority analysis for this comparison in data analysis. To fully power the above 
contrasts, we estimate needing 293 p er group X 4 groups = 1172 subjects. Adding 293 in the zero message group, 
we would need a total of 1465 subjects. There are currently 1000 children eligible for the study. More will become 
eligible every month so we expect to exceed the required sample si ze after 2 replications. If needed, we could 
increase the number of replications of this trial to reach the targeted sample size.  We acknowledge that we are not 
powered to precisely estimate any interactions between interventions.  
 
Televox (6 -11yo) Trial:  
We calculated sample size based on the following hypotheses:  
 
% of children complete WCC within 8 weeks  
no message  2 Low Tailored 
Messages  
 2 High Tailored 
Messages  
 
2% 20% 30% 
 
With alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, to fully power the contrasts between the above groups, we need 293 per 
group X 3 groups=879 subjects. Currently there are 2500 kids eligible, so we expect to reach the targeted sample 
size.  
 
Televox (12 -17yo) Trial:  
We calculated sample size based on the following hypotheses:  
 
% of children complete WCC within 8 weeks  
no message  2 Low Tailored 
Messages  
 2 COVID Tailored 
Messages  
 
2% 30% 40% 
 
With alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, to fully power the contrasts between the above groups, we need 356 per 
group X 3 groups=1068 subjects. Currently there are 1100 kids eligible, so we expect to reach the targeted sample 
size.  
 
 
Analysis  
We will conduct descriptive analyses to characterize the participants in terms of demographics and other potential 
covariates in consideration (child age group, parent’s preference for call vs. text mode of contact, whether parent 
had activated MyChart account, access to appointment,  whether patient receipt of any past immunizations, historic 
no show rate, and community rates of COVID).  We will use chi square tests to examine whether participants in the 
4 groups are similar in these characteristics.  
 
For the Personal Contact (12 -14 mo & 4 years old) trials,we will conduct intent -to-treat analyses using logistic 
regression models (without adjusting for covariates)  for each of our three binary outcomes: completed appointment 
Outreach Methods Study Protocol  
Version 1.1, 1 /14/22  
pg. 9 within 2 weeks, c ompleted  appointment within 8 weeks, receipt of MMR by 15 months of age or receipt of 2nd 
MMR by 3 months after randomization. We will do pair -wise comparison among the 4 groups and adjust p value of 
each comparison for multiplicity. If participants in the 4 groups differ on potential covariates, we will conduct 
additional analyses adjusted fo r these variables.   
 
For the MyChart and Televox Trials (6 -17 years old), we will conduct intent -to-treat analyses using logistic 
regression models (without adjusting for covariates)  for each of the binary outcomes: scheduled appointment within 
2 weeks, c ompleted  appointment within 8 weeks, receipt of 1st dose of COVID vaccination (age 12 -17 years) within 
8 weeks, family member receipt of COVID vaccination within 8 weeks. We will do pair -wise comparison among the 
treatment groups and adjust p value of each  comparison for multiplicity. If participants differ in potential covariates 
across treatment groups, we will conduct additional analyses adjusted for these variables. We will explore non -
inferiority analysis for comparison the two groups that are expected  to have similar appointment scheduled and 
completion rate in the MyChart trial.  
 
We will also conduct per -protocol analyses according to the interventions actually received by the participants, 
recognizing that actual intervention received could be diffe rent from initial randomized intervention. . For example, 
a parent allocated to group A might schedule an appointment after receiving the automated message and therefore 
would not receive a personalized contact attempt. In addition, we may explore potentia l interaction between the two 
interventions as a secondary analysis. All analysis will be conducted using SAS version 9.4.  
 
Duration  
The study will begin upon IRB approval and continue through December 31, 2022.  During this time, we will 
discuss the sign ificance of data, potential future projects and dissemination of results.  
 
Process of Obtaining Consent  
For this study, we request a waiver of consent due to the minimal risk to participants involved. Given the population 
we are attempting to contact using  the various outreach methods has missed appointments, it would not be possible 
to obtain prospective consent.  That said, we will honor parent preferences for how they receive automated 
messages.  Collected data about appointment attendance and MMR vaccin ation status is already being documented 
in the EHR, and the collection of data will not affect the rights and welfare of subjects.  
 
We request waiver of consent such that there is (1) potential, minimal, risks to the participant (see below), (2) de -
identi fication of PHI, and (3) participation in the study will not affect current/future care received through CCHMC.  
 
All identifying information will be removed once data collection is complete. Data will be kept securely on a 
CCHMC computer that is password p rotected. Any hard copies of data will be locked in a private office.  
 
Facilities and Performance Sites  
Data analysis will be done on the Main Campus of CCHMC and at the CCHMC primary care offices (PPCC, HPC,

The result s of this study will aid CCHMC pediatric primary care centers in improving and redesigning an outreach 
system to children behind on necessary preventative services who have gaps in needed primary care.  It will identify 
the most effective ways to reach, en gage, and schedule patients for care when appropriate.  This will enable the 
primary care offices to allocate the appropriate amount of resource to outreach efforts moving forward, ensuring 
high risk children receive reminders for care.  
 
Potential risks, discomforts, inconveniences, and precautions  
The only significant risks are breach of confidentiality and potential discomfort/inconvenience associated with 
receiving texts or phone calls indicating that care gaps exist for a child.  As noted above, person al health information 
(PHI) will be obtained via the electronic medical record.  After obtaining this information, patients will be de -
identified in the created database and securely stored.  
 
Risk/Benefit analysis  
While immediate benefit to any given indi vidual or family is unknown, this study involves minimal risk.

Unilat eral Simple Bunionectomy  
Name of Active Ingredients:  
bupivacaine and meloxicam  Phase of Development: 3 
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective : 
 To compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia following local administration of HTX -011 with 
that of saline placebo during the first 72  hours following unilateral simple bunionectomy.  
Secondary Objectives:  
 To compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia for HTX -011 with bupivacaine HCl without 
epinephrine during the first 72  hours following surgery in this study population.  
 To compare the effect of HTX -011 with saline placebo and bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine 
on opioid load during the first 72  hours following surgery in this study population.  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of HTX -011 in this st udy population.  
 To further establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of bupivacaine and meloxicam in 
HTX -011 in this study population.  
Methodology: This is a Phase  3, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active -controlled, 
multicenter study i n subjects undergoing  unilateral simple bunionectomy.  
Subjects will be screened within 2 8 days prior to surgery. Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility 
criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to surgery. On th e day 
of surgery (Day  1), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will undergo a unilateral simple 
bunionectomy under regional anesthesia  with no more than 20 mL of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine 
administered as a Mayo block . Epidural or s pinal anesthesia is not permitted. During surgery, the use  of 
intravenous ( IV) fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg will be permitted  for intraoperative pain control . Intraoperative 
administration of other opioids  or any other analgesics  (including ketamine) , local anesthetics,  or 
anti-inflammatory agents (except as specified by the protocol) is prohibited, unless needed to treat an 
adverse event  (AE) that occurs after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) , for pretreatment prior to a 
needle placement , or to decrea se venous irritation (eg, caused by propofol , in which case no more than a 
single administration of lidocaine 1% 20 mg IV may be administered) .  
Near the completion of surgery  and after irrigation and suction have been completed , a single dose of 
study drug (HTX -011, saline placebo, or bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine) will be given 
intraoperatively via local administration into the surgical site.  
Following surgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the 
postanesthes ia care unit (PACU). Subjects will remain in the hospital/research facility for a minimum of 
72 hours after the start of study drug administration to undergo postoperative assessments. After the 
72-hour assessments have been completed, subjects may be disc harged. Subjects will return to the study

site on Days  10 and 28  to complete follow -up assessments. In addition, subjects will return for a Safety 
Follow -Up on Day 42.  
Treatment Groups  
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment group s in a 3:3:2 ratio:  
 HTX -011, 60 mg/1 .8 mg (bupivacaine/meloxicam doses), 2.1 mL, via instillation into the surgical 
site ( 150 subjects)  
 Bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine 0.5%, 50  mg (10 mL), via injection into the surgical site 
(150 subjec ts) 
 Saline placebo, 2.1  mL, via instillation into the surgical site (100 subjects)  
Blinding  
The study will use a double -blind design . The site’s pharmacy staff and surgical staff will not be blinded 
to the treatment assignments because HTX -011 is a colored  and viscous liquid whereas saline placebo and 
bupivacaine HCl are not, and the volume of study drug to be administered varies by treatment group. 
However, subjects will not be aware of the study drug they are receiving, and once surgery is complete 
and th e subject is transferred to the PACU, the assessor and all staff involved in efficacy and safety 
assessments will be blinded to treatment assignments until after database lock.  
Postoperative Rescue Medications  
Subjects should only receive rescue medicatio n upon request for pain control, as needed, during the 
72-hour postoperative observation period.  Rescue medication should not be given for pain prophylaxis, 
but only for treating postoperative pain. Prior to the administration of the first dose of rescue m edication, 
if the subject has not already had at least 1 postoperative pain score assessed, then a Numeric Rating 
Scale (NRS) score at rest (NRS -R) followed by a n NRS  score with activity (NRS -A) must be obtained.  
Postoperative rescue medication will consis t of oral (PO) immediate -release oxycodone ( no more than  
10 mg within a 4 -hour period as needed) , IV morphine ( no more than 10 mg  within a 2 -hour period  as 
needed ), and/or oral acetaminophen (no more than 1 gram [1000 mg] in a 6 -hour window). For subjects 
administered any acetaminophen -containing product, the total combined daily dose must not exceed 
4 grams (4000 mg) as severe liver damage may occur . No other analgesic agents , including nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , are permitted during the 72 -hour postoperative observation period.  
Subjects who are not medically ready for discharge  at 72 hours  may receive the same rescue medication 
as above to treat postoperative pain until discharge.  
For subjects who are medically ready for discharge  at 72 hours , oral acetaminophen (no more than 
1000  mg every 6  hours  as needed ) should  be recommended for postoperative pain.  If a subject received 
10 mg or more of oxyc odone in the 12 hours prior to discharge, the subject should be pr ovided with a 
prescription for o xycodone  (up to 10 mg PO q4h as needed) . Subjects will complete a daily diary to 
record if they take an opioid medication  between 72 hours and Day  28. 
Number of Planned Subjects: Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized and dosed.

Statistical Methods:  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary estimand to address the efficacy objectives is the mean AUC of NRS -A pain intensity scores 
through 72 hours (AUC 0-72) adjusted for use of opioid rescue medication via windowed worst observation 
carried forward ( wWOCF ), comparing the estimated treatment difference between HTX -011 and saline 
placebo using analysi s of variance ( ANOVA ) with missing data imputed via last observation carried

(WOCF) for right -censored pain intensity scores in the Intent -to-Treat Population.  
The primary analysis of AUC 0-72 of the NRS -A pain intensity scores will be carried out using an ANOVA 
model with treatment as the main effect, comparing HTX -011 with saline placebo at a significance level 
of 5%. Results will be expressed as mean AUCs and SDs, least -squares mean differences and SEs with 
associated 95% CIs, and p -values . To account for the duration effect of opioid rescue medication, the

wWOCF method will be implemented as the primary analysis method for endpoints involving NRS  pain 
intensit y scores . In this method, pain intensity scores observed during the analgesic window (duration of 
effect) of any opioid rescue medication will be replaced with the worst (highest) postdose nonmissing 
NRS pain intensity score observed prior to the rescue me dication window, with the following exception: 
if the NRS pain intensity score for a windowed observation is higher than the worst pre -window score, 
then it will not be replaced . Sensitivity analyses for endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores will 
analyze the data without adjustment for the effect of opioid rescue medications.  
To account for multiple hypothesis testing on the primary endpoint and on each of the 4 key secondary 
endpoints, a strict testing hierarchy  will be applied to control study -wise alpha level at 0.05 . If the primary 
endpoint is  statistically significant  (p≤0.05) , then the first key secondary endpoint will be tested. If the 
first key secondary endpoint is statistically significant, then the second key secondary endpoint will be 
tested. Sequential testing will continue in this manner down the key secondary endpoint list until an 
endpoint fails to meet statistical significance, after which all subsequent key secondary endpoints will be 
considered exploratory.  If the primary endpoint i s not statistically significant, then all key secondary 
endpoints will be considered exploratory.  
Continuous endpoints will be analyzed using an ANOVA model with treatment as the main effect. 
Results will be expressed as means and SDs, least -squares mean d ifferences and SEs with associated 
95% CIs, and p -values.  
Categorical endpoints will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Results will be expressed as the number 
and percentage of subjects meeting the relevant endpoint, differences in proportions with 95% CIs, and 
p-values.  
Median time in hours to first opioid rescue administration will be analyzed with Kaplan -Meier methods.  
Handling of Missing Data  
Due to the required 72 -hour inpatient postoperative observation period, the amount of missing data is 
expected to be very low. For any missing data observed  through 72 hours  in subjects who complete the 
72-hour postoperative observation period , NRS pain intensity  scores will be imputed via LOCF, in which 
the most recent postdose value is used for a subsequen t missing value. For subjects who do not have a 
postdose value prior to their first missing value, the median of the postdose values at the relevant 
timepoint from subjects with observed data in the same randomized treatment group will be used. Predose 
values will not be carried forward to postdose timepoints . In subjects who withdraw from the study prior 
to 72 hours , missing NRS pain  intensity scores  through 72  hours  that were to be collected following 
withdrawal will be imputed via WOCF, in which the wors t (highest) NRS pain intensity score observed 
prior to withdrawal will be used for post -withdrawal values through 72  hours. Analyses that adjust for the 
effect of opioid rescue medication will perform wWOCF following LOCF /WOCF  (ie, perform 
LOCF /WOCF  first, then apply wWOCF).  The number and percentage of missing NRS pain intensity 
scores will be summarized.

* The start of study drug administration will be con sidered as Time 0 for all efficacy, safety, and PK assessments. For assessments at timepoints when the subject is asleep, an 
attempt should be made to wake the subject. If there is no response, the assessments at these timepoints may be recorded as “ Not Do ne.” Assessments that can be done without 
waking the subject (eg, blood collection for PK) should be completed. When PK and NRS pain intensity assessments coincide, th e NRS pain intensity assessments should be 
conducted before the blood draw. See Section  6 for more information on study procedures and assessments.  
a Subjects who withdraw from the study will be asked to complete Early Termination procedures  based on the timing of withdrawal (ie, prior to the Day 28 Visit, or after the Day 
28 Visit and prior to the Safety Follow -Up on Day 42) . 
b The urine drug screen a nd urine pregnancy test should be performed first. Results should be confirmed negative prior to performing any additional as sessments and prior to

Confidential 22 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background Information and Study Rationale 
Up to 70% of patients have moderate to severe pain after surgery, and the most severe pain 
occurs within the first 72 hours (Lynch, 1997;  Svensson, 2000;  Apfelbaum, 2003;  Gan, 2014 ;  
Misiolek, 2014 ;  Singla, 2014;  Meissner, 2015) . Administering a local anesthetic (eg, 
bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or levobupivacaine) is a relatively simple and safe means of providing 
postoperative pain relief. A major limitation of current local anesthetics is their short duration of 
effect (6 to 12 hours following surgery) (Kehlet, 2011) . Consequently, many patients are given 
opioids for pain management.  The requirement for opioids postoperatively is a serious 
manifestation of ineffective pain relief. Exposure to opioids can lead to opioid-related adverse 
events (ORAEs) resulting in worse patient outcomes and increased hospital costs (Coley, 2002 ;  
Wheeler, 2002;  Stephens, 2003;  Cashman, 2004 ;  Shirakami, 2005;  Jarzyna, 2011;  
Ramachandran, 2011;  Chan, 2013;  Kessler, 2013;  Oderda, 2013;  Lee, 2015;  Lee, 2016) . 
Furthermore, transition from acute opioid use to chronic use can occur quickly. A recent review 
of a random sample of records from patients who had at least 1  opioid prescription between  2006  
and 2015 showed that the probability of chronic opioid use begins to increase after the third day 
supplied and rises rapidly thereafter (Shah, 2017) . The United States (US) is facing a national 
opioid crisis that has led to a public health epidemic with multiple national and state responses. 
In 2015, 2 million Americans had a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers, 
a
nd over 20,000 accidental overdose deaths were related to prescription pain relievers (Bose, 
2016 ;  Rudd, 2016) . Reduced exposure to opioids and better pain management is associated with 
improved patient outcomes and reduced  risk for the development of persistent pain and 
consequent opioid abuse (Barnett, 2017) . Therefore, there is a medical need for clinical 
a
lternatives to prescription opioids to manage ambulatory nonmalignant pain. The development 
of an extended-release local anesthetic applicable for a broad range of surgeries that could 
significantly reduce both pain and opioid use after surgery and can be easily administered with a 
favorable safety profile would address an important public health need. 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. (Heron) is developing HTX-011 for local administration into the 
surgical site to reduce postoperative pain and the need for opioid analgesics through 72 hours. 
HTX-011  is an extended-release, fixed-ratio combination product that contains 2 active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), bupivacaine as the main or disease-active ingredient and 
low-dose meloxicam to enhance the effectiveness of bupivacaine, incorporated in a proprietary 
bioerodible polymer (termed Biochronomer®). When HTX-011 is administered, the polymer 
undergoes controlled hydrolysis in the tissue resulting in the extended release of bupivacaine and 
meloxicam over 3 days. Bupivacaine HCl is an amide-type, long-acting, immediate-release,  local 
anesthetic and meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Both have been 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in many countries outside the US 
and have a long history of clinical use. Bupivacaine is available as a solution for injection and is 
approved for surgical anesthesia and for acute pain management (nerve block) in adults and 
children (MARCAINE, SENSORCAINE®, and  VIVACAINETM). Meloxicam is available as a

Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 23 spondylitis in adults. The extended release is achieved using a proprietary vehicle formulation 
consisting of the novel tri[ethylene glycol]-based poly[orthoester] polymer (AP135) in 
combination with different excipients approved for human use (dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol 
triacetate [triacetin], and maleic acid). 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, saline placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter 
study in subjects undergoing unilateral simple bunionectomy to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, 
safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HTX-011 administered via local administration into the 
surgical site. 
1
.2. Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Control Groups 
Bunionectomy is an accepted model of postoperative pain. Bunionectomy produces generally 
reliable and persistent pain symptoms for a period typically lasting over 72 hours from the 
surgery, which allows for analysis of acute analgesia over an extended period of time. 
The study will compare HTX-011 via local administration into the surgical site with 2 controls: a 
saline placebo control and an active control, bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine. The study 
will employ a randomized and double-blind design to minimize potential bias in subject selection 
as well as efficacy and safety assessments. The site’s pharmacy staff and surgical staff  will not 
be blinded to the treatment assignments because HTX-011 is a colored and viscous liquid 
whereas bupivacaine HCl and saline placebo are not, and the volume of study drug to be 
administered varies by treatment group. However, subjects will not be aware of the study drug 
they are receiving, and once surgery is complete and the subject is transferred to the 
postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the Investigator and all staff involved in efficacy and safety 
assessments will be blinded to treatment assignments until after database lock. 
One dose level of HTX-011 will be evaluated in this study, 60 mg/1.8 mg 
(bupivacaine/meloxicam doses) administered via instillation. The d ose and administration 
technique were select ed based on a previous Phase 2,  dose-finding study in bunionectomy 
(Study 208). In Study 208,  HTX-011  doses ranging from 30 mg/0.9 mg to 200  mg/6 mg 
administered via different local administration techniques (injection, injection using a Mayo 
block, instillation) were evaluated.  The 60 mg/1.8 mg dose was determined to be the minimally 
effective dose for producing postoperative analgesia through 72 hours. An evaluation of pain 
intensity scores by local administration technique for HTX 011 60 mg/1.8 mg demonstrated a 
significant reduction in mean pain intensity over 72 hours when HTX-011 was administered via 
instillation compared with saline placebo and bupivacaine HCl.  HTX-011  60 mg/1.8 mg had a 
favorable safety profile . No serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed for this dose.  Based on 
these findings, 60 mg/1.8 mg administered via instillation was selected for this Phase 3 study. 
The primary endpoint for this study, mean area under the curve (AUC) of the Numeric Rating 
Scale of pain intensity scores with activity (NRS-A) through 72 hours (AUC 0-72) for HTX-011 
compared with saline placebo, was selected based on FDA and Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) guidances as well as regulatory precedent. Draft FDA 
Guidance for Industry on Analgesic Indications: Developing Drug and Biological Products  
(February 2014) states that “p a in intensity is the fundamental measure that defines the efficacy of 
an analgesic drug .” In addition, the FDA agreed to a primary endpoint of AUC of the NRS pain 
intensity scores over t he first 24-hour period in a bony model (bunionectomy) for EXPAREL® 
(EXPAREL USPI, 2016 ). The timepoint of 72  hours selected for this study is considered 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 24 clinically relevant for patients as literature shows  that the most severe postoperative pain occurs 
within the first 72 hours after surgery (Lynch 1997;  Svensson 2000;  Apfelbaum 2003;  Gan 
2014 ;  Misiolek 2014;  Singla 2014;  Meissner 2015) . NRS-A was selected for the primary 
endpoint because activity is known to be a more sensitive measure of pain control (Breivik, 
2008 ), and the prescribed activity reflects a simple daily activity for patients (sitting with the 
plantar surface of the ball of the surgically attended foot touching the floor [no weight-bearing] ). 
The primary comparator is saline placebo , as recommended in the February 2014 FDA draft 
Guidance for Industry on Analgesic Indications: Developing Drug and Biological Products  and 
the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP ’s) Note for Guidance on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products For Treatment of Nociceptive Pain  (Doc. Ref. 
CPMP/EWP/612/00). Bupivacaine HCl is included as an active comparator. Bupivacaine HCl is 
the widely accepted standard for local analgesia. Bupivacaine is the disease-active ingredient in 
the HTX-011 fixed-ratio combination product with low-dose meloxicam included to enhance the 
effectiveness of bupivacaine. Discussions with experts confirmed that bupivacaine doses 
commonly used for bunionectomy range from 8 to 10 mL using 0.25% or 0.5% solution 
delivered into the wound. The dose of bupivacaine solution selected for this Phase 3 study, 
50 mg (10 mL of 0.5% solution), reflects the maximum dose and maximum concentration that is 
commonly used and allows for appropriate comparisons within the study. This dose is within the 
range of dosing provided in bupivacaine labelin g (MARCAINE USPI, 2011;  MARCAIN SmPC, 
2016 ) and is further supported by a clinical study of EXPAREL in bunionectomy, which used a 
volume of 8 mL for both EXPAREL and placebo (Golf, 2011) , and by published literature with 
active comparators (Ptaszek, 1999;  Baxter, 2013) . All subjects with inadequately controlled pain 
will have access to prespecified rescue medication, including both non-opioid (acetaminophen) 
and opioid (morphine and/or oxycodone) options. 
The study includes 4 prespecified key secondary endpoints with a strict statistical hypothesis 
testing hierarchy to preserve the study-wise alpha level at 5%. Given the importance of 
comparison to the bupivacaine active control arm in order to satisfy the Combination Rule, 
21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 300.50 Fixed-Combination Prescription Drugs for 
Humans , the first key secondary endpoint will evaluate the mean AUC 0-72 of the NRS-A pain 
intensity scores compared with an active control,  bupivacaine HCl.  The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th key 
secondary endpoints will evaluate opioid consumption through 72 hours compared with saline 
placebo, proportion of subjects who are opioid-free through 72 hours compared with bupivacaine 
HCl, and opioid consumption through 72 hours compared with bupivacaine HCl, respectively.  
Given the concern for misuse and abuse of opioids, a reduction in opioid load and an increase in 
the number of subjects who are opioid free are considered clinically meaningful endpoints and 
a
re in alignment with the February 2014 FDA draft Guidance for Industry on Analgesic 
Indications: Developing Drug and Biological Products . Opioid sparing endpoints were also 
included in recently approved labels for EXPAREL, OFIRMEV®, and CALDOLOR®, and 
NAROPIN®. 
1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits 
As of 23 March 2017, 665 subjects have been exposed to 1 of the 3 different formulations of 
HTX-011 in 6 clinical studies. This includes 2 Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers 
(subcutaneous study drug administration [Studies 02 and 102]) and 4  Phase 2 local 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc.

Confidential 26 Use of HTX-011 in subjects with hypersensitivity to bupivacaine, meloxicam, or any of the 
components of HTX-011 is contraindicated. 
The analgesic efficacy of HTX-011 has been evaluated in Phase 2. In a Phase 2 study in subjects 
undergoing unilateral simple bunionectomy, single -dose administration of the Phase 3 HTX-011 
formulation ranging from 60 mg/1.8 mg to 200 mg/6 mg resulted in a significant reduction in 
mean AUC of pain intensity scores through 72 hours. HTX-011 was also associated with 
decreased total opioid consumption, and resulted in more subjects who were opioid-free and a 
longer time to first opioid use compared with saline placebo. Similar efficacy results were 
observed in a second Phase 2 study in subjects undergoing unilateral open inguinal 
herniorrhaphy, where single-dose administration of the current HTX-011 formulation at doses of 
200 mg/6 mg to 400 mg/12 mg also significantly decreased the mean AUC of pain intensity 
scores through 72 hours compared with saline placebo.

3.1. Description of the Study Design 
3.1.1.  Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, saline placebo- and active-controlled, multicenter 
study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and PK of HTX-011  administered via local 
administration into the surgical site in subjects undergoing unilateral simple bunionectomy. 
All subjects will be screened within 2 8 days prior to surgery. Subjects who meet the Screening 
eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to 
the day of surgery. On the day of surgery (Day 1), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility 
criteria will undergo a unilateral simple bunionectomy under regional anesthesia with no more 
than 20 m
L of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine administered as a Mayo block. Epidural or 
spinal anesthesia is not permitted. During surgery, the use of intravenous (IV) fentanyl up to 
4 μg/kg  will be permitted for intraoperative pain control. Intraoperative administration of other 
opioids or other analgesics, local anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents (except as specified by 
the protocol) is prohibited, unless needed to treat an adverse event (AE) that occurs after signing 
the Informed Consent Form (ICF),  for pretreatment prior to a needle placement, or to decrease 
venous irritation (eg, caused by propofol,  in which case no more than a single administration of 
lidocaine 1% 2 0 mg IV may be administered). 
Near the completion of surgery and after irrigation and suction have been completed, a single 
dose of study drug (HTX-011, saline placebo, or bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine) will be 
given intraoperatively via local administration into the surgical site, as described in Section 5.5. 
Following surgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the 
PACU. Subjects will remain in the hospital/research facility for a minimum of 72 hours after the 
start of study drug administration to undergo postoperative assessments. After the 72-hour 
assessments have been completed, subjects may be discharged. Subjects will return to the study 
site on Days 10 and 28 to complete follow-up assessments. In addition, subjects will return for a 
Safety Follow-Up on Day 42. 
3.1.2.  Treatment Groups 
Approximately 400  subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 3  treatment groups in a 
3:3:2 ratio: 
 HTX-011, 60 mg/1.8 mg (bupivacaine/meloxicam doses), 2.1 mL, via instillation into 
the surgical site (1 50 subjects) 
 Bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine 0.5%, 50 mg (10  mL), via injection into the 
surgical site (150 subjects)  
 Saline placebo, 2.1 mL, via instillation into the surgical site (100 subjects)

Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 29 3.1.3.  Postoperative Rescue Medications 
Subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request for pain control, as needed, during 
the 72-hour postoperative observation period.  Rescue medication should not be given for pain 
prophylaxis, but only for treating postoperative pain. Prior to the administration of the first dose 
of rescue medication, if the subject has not already had at least 1 postoperative pain score 
assessed, then a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score at rest (NRS-R) followed by a Numeric 
Rating Scale score with activity (NRS-A) pain score must be obtained. 
Postoperative rescue medication will consist of oral (PO) immediate-release oxycodone (no more 
than 10 mg within a 4-hour period as needed),  IV morphine (no more than 10  mg within a 2-hour 
period as needed),  and/or oral acetaminophen (no more than 1 gram [1000 mg] in a 6-hour 
window). For subjects administered any acetaminophen-containing product, the total combined 
daily dose must not exceed 4 grams (4000 mg) as severe liver damage may occur. No other 
analgesic agen ts, including NSAIDs,  are permitted during the 72-hour postoperative observation 
period.  
Subjects who are not medically ready for discharge at 72 hours may receive the same rescue 
medication as above to treat postoperative pain until discharge. 
For subjects who are medically ready for discharge at 72 hours,  oral acetaminophen (no more 
than 1000 mg every 6 hours as needed) should be recommended for postoperative pain. If a 
subject received 10 mg or more of oxycodone in the 12 hours prior to discharge, the subject 
shoul
d be provided with a prescription for oxycodone (up to 10 mg PO q4h as needed).  See 
Appendix G for instructions on  postoperative pain management for subjects medically ready for 
discharge. 
Subjects will complete a daily diary to record if they take an opioid medication between 72 hours 
and Day 28.  
3.1.4.  Postoperative Assessments 
Efficacy assessments will include pain intensity scores using NRS-R and NRS-A, use of opioid 
medication,  discharge readiness as assessed by the Modified Postanaesthetic Discharge Scoring 
System (MPADSS) , and Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control. 
Safety assessments will include AE recording, local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) 
assessments, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), hematology and 
serum chemistry, wound healing, and bone healing (X-ray) assessment s. 
PK assessments will include the collection of blood samples for bupivacaine and meloxicam PK 
analysis.  See Section 7.2.2  for instructions regarding unscheduled PK blood sample collection 
for signs and symptoms associated with potential LAST. 
See Section 6 for more information on the study procedures and assessments. For the timing of 
procedures and assessments, see Section 7 and the Schedule of Events  table.

4.2. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be 
done up to 1 business day prior to the day of surgery. Subjects will be randomized using a 
centralized computer-generated blocked randomization algorithm created by an interactive 
response technology (IRT) provider. All randomization information will be kept in a secure 
location accessible only by the randomization personnel,  the assigned Pharmacist(s) and his/her 
verifier, and the unblinded clinical monitor. No subject may receive study drug prior to 
randomization. 
4.2.1.  Procedures for Handling Randomized Subjects Who Do Not Meet the Study 
Eligibility Criteria 
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, receive 
study drug.  
Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria and are randomized but who do not meet the 
eligibility criteria on Day 1  will be withdrawn from the study without receiving study drug. In 
the event a subject does not meet the eligibility criteria,  but is randomized and receives study 
drug, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor immediately. The Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor 
and the Investigator will discuss whether to allow the subject to continue on study.

Confidential 35 4.3. Blinding 
The study will use a double-blind design  to minimize potential bias in subject selection as well as 
efficacy and safety assessments. The site’s pharmacy and surgical staff will not be blinded to the 
treatment assignments because HTX-011  is a colored and viscous liquid whereas bupivacaine 
HCl and saline placebo are not,  and the volume of study drug to be administered varies by 
treatment group. However, subjects will not be aware of the study drug they are receiving, and 
once surgery is completed and the subject is transferred to the PACU , the Investigator and all site 
staff involved in safety and efficacy assessments will be blinded to the treatment assignment 
until after database lock. The Sponsor’s study team will also be blinded to the treatment 
assignments with the exception of the clinical trial material (CTM) and clinical observer staff. 
4.3.1.  Breaking the Blind 
The study blind should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the study drug he/she received. An attempt 
should be made to contact the Sponsor before breaking the blind. If the Sponsor cannot be 
reached and the blind is broken by the Investigator, the reason for unblinding must be 
documented and the Sponsor must be contacted within 24 hours.  
The Sponsor retains the right to break the treatment code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  
All circumstances leading to the premature unblinding must be clearly documented. 
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement 
4.4.1.  Subject Withdrawal 
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment. 
A subject may also be withdrawn from the study by the Investigator or the Sponsor at any time if 
either determines that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue participation . 
Possible reasons for early withdrawal include the following: 
 Adverse event 
 Consent withdrawal 
 Death 
 Lost to follow up 
 Investigator’s decision  
 Sponsor’s decision  
 Ineligible at Day 1 
The date and the primary reason for early withdrawal will be recorded on the electron ic case 
report form (eCRF). At the time of withdrawal from the study,  every attempt should be made to 
complete the Early Termination Visit assessments (s ee Section 7.3.1.3 ).

Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 37 5. STUDY TREATMENT 
All subjects will receive a single dose of study drug intraoperatively while undergoing a 
bunionectomy. Study drug is defined as HTX-011 (investigational product) , saline placebo 
(control), or bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine (active control). 
HTX-011 , saline placebo, and bupivacaine HCl will be supplied by the Sponsor.  
5.1. Description of Investigational Product 
HTX-011  is a slightly yellow,  viscous , semi-solid gel liquid. HTX-011  is supplied in 10 mL or 
20 mL clear glass vials. The vials serve only as a closed container for the drug product. For 
administration of study drug, the formulation in the vials will be aseptically transferred to sterile 
syringes. 
5.2. Manufacturing, Packaging, and Labeling 
HTX-011  will be manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices. 
Study drug will be packaged and labeled by the Sponsor or designee and will be packed and 
dispatched to comply with shipping and storage conditions. Study drug labeling will comply with 
all applicable national and local laws and regulations.  
5.3. Storage 
At the study site, HTX-011 should be stored at a controlled room temperature of 20 to 25°C 
(with excursions permitted from 15 to 30°C). The room should be locked with restricted access. 
A temperature log must be maintained to monitor the room’s  temperature. 
Saline placebo and bupivacaine HCl will be stored as per the prescribing information. 
5.4. Preparation 
Study drug will be prepared at the study site. HTX-011 and saline placebo will be prepared in a 
group of syringes without a needle. Bupivacaine HCl will be prepared in a group of syringes 
with a needle. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details on study drug preparation.  
5.5. Study Drug Administration 
Study drug will be given via local administration in to t he surgical wound prior to wound closure, 
after irrigation and suction of each layer are complete.  “Infiltration ” is a regulatory term for 
product labels to describe local administration via instillation or injection. 
5.5.1.  Instillation: HTX-011 and Saline Placebo 
HTX-011 and saline placebo will be administered via instillation using a Luer-lock applicator 
supplied by the Sponsor. 
Following irrigation and suction of each fascial layer, study drug will be administered evenly so 
that all tissues receive adequate coverage. Care should be taken to ensure adequate exposure of 
the proximal and distal ends (ie, beyond the bony incision) of the wound to study drug. Study 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 38 drug should form  rings of anesthetic around both the proximal and distal aspects of the 
metatarsal. To ensure adequate saturation of all exposed tissues in the surgical field, study drug 
may be administered in layers.  Note that the shallow subdermal layer is to be avoided and that all 
study drug should be utilized (ie, there should be no residual study drug left). Thereafter, skin 
c
losure will commence to complete the surgical procedure (ie, there should be no betadine wash 
unti
l after skin closure at the end of the case). 
5.5.2.  Injection: Bupivacaine HCl 
Bupivacaine HCl will be administered via injection. Study drug should be administered 
throughout the tissue planes to ensure equal distribution across the surgical field. The medication 
should form rings of anesthetic around both the proximal and distal aspects of the metatarsal. An 
appropriate way of doing this is as follows: 
 Start proximal to the bony incision and administer half the contents of the syringe 
distally past the bony incision (blue arrows in photo below). 
 Repeat the procedure with the rest of the syringe but now start distally and inject 
proximally (red arrows in photo below). 
 Ensure adequate saturation of all exposed tissues in the surgical field. 
 Thereafter, commence skin closure to complete the surgical procedure (ie, there 
should be no betadine wash until after skin closure at the end of the case).

Confidential 39 5.6. Study Drug Compliance 
All study drug must be administered in accordance with the treatment assignment. Because study 
drug is being administered as a component of the surgical procedure, a lack of treatment 
compliance is not expected.  
5.7. Study Drug Accountability 
The study drugs provided for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol. In 
accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Investigators are required to maintain accurate 
and up- to-date records of all study drug to permit reconciliation. The Investigator or designee 
must maintain adequate records of distribution, including the date received, number and units 
re
ceived, lot numbers, dispensing, and return or destruction of all study drug (ie, accountability 
or dispensing logs). 
All study drug records must be readily available for inspection by the site ’s unblinded clinical 
monitor and/or auditor. No study drug can be returned to the Sponsor or designee or disposed of 
at the study site until the unblinded clinical monitor has verified the accuracy of the study drug 
records at the study site. All returns, disposal, or destruction must be approved by the Sponsor in 
writing.

The following sections describe the study procedures and assessments that will be performed 
during the study. See Section 7 and the Schedule of Events  table.  
6.1. Medical History and Demographics 
6.1.1.  Medical History 
A complete medical history will be obtained before randomization to ensure subjects qualify for 
the study. Medical history will be obtained through subject interview. A review of the subject’s 
medical records from their primary care physician is recommended. Data collected will include 
medical and surgical history. 
6.1.2.  Demographics 
Demographic information collected will include age, sex, race, and ethnicity. 
6.2. Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All medications taken by subjects between signing the ICF and the Safety Follow-Up on Day 42 
will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF . The dosing regimen of “prn” should not be recorded on 
the eCRF. 
During the 72-hour postoperative period, the name, dose, and route,  as well as the start date and 
time, of concomitant medications must be recorded. Medications include prescription or 
over-the-counter medications (including herbal products and vitamins). For subjects entering on 
a stable dose of permitted medication, any change in dose should also be recorded. Note: All 
medications received during this period must have a start time recorded, except for IV fluids and 
oxygen during surgery, which do not need to be recorded unless being used to treat an AE. 
After the 72-hour period until the Safety Follow-Up on Day 4 2, at least the start date of each 
concomitant medication should be recorded. 
6.2.1.  Allowed Concomitant Medications 
All treatments that the Investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the Investigator’s in keeping w ith the standard of medical care. 
Antiemetic medications may be given to treat nausea and/or vomiting, but should not be 
administered prophylactically (ie, as a routine preventative in the absence of signs or symptoms 
of nausea or vomiting). 
During surgery, the use of IV fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg is permitted  for intraoperative pain control.  
As the prescribing information for fentanyl citrate (Fentanyl Citrate USPI, 2012 ) specifies that 
for intraoperative use a “moderate dose” of 2 to 20  μg/kg IV is necessary in order to allow the 
anesthesiologist to respond to any signal that the surgical stress is increasing or anesthesia 
lightening, this dose was chosen to be in the lowermost portion of that range and therefore not 
interfere with assessment of postoperative opioid load. As clinically appropriate, the minimum 
possible fentanyl dose should be used.

Confidential 41 See Section 3.1.3  for information on rescue medications permitted. 
See Appendix G for information on postoperative pain management for subjects who are 
medical ly ready for discharge. 
6.2.2.  Prohibited Medications 
6.2.2.1. Medications Prohibited Prior to Surgery 
Refer to exclusion criteria 5 through 11 and 17 for medications that are prohibited prior to the 
scheduled surgery ( Section 4.1.2 ). Of note, for exclusion criterion 12 , oral, parenteral,  and 
topical steroids are considered systemic steroids, but inhaled and ophthalmic steroids are not 
considered systemic steroids.  
6.2.2.2. Medications Prohibited During Surgery 
Epidural or spinal anesthesia is not permitted. 
Intraoperative administration of opioids or any other analgesics (including ketamine), local 
anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents except as specified by the protocol (ie, HTX-011, 
bupivacaine HCl, and fentanyl) is prohibited, unless needed to treat an AE that occurs after 
signing the ICF,  for pretreatment prior to a needle placement,  or to decrease venous irritation (eg, 
caused by propofol, in which case no more than a single administration of lidocaine 1% 2 0 mg 
IV may be administered). 
6.2.2.3. Medications Prohibited From Time 0 Through 72 Hours 
With the exception of rescue medications specified in Section 3.1.3 , no other analgesic agents, 
including NSAIDs, are permitted during the 72-hour postoperative observation period. 
6.3. Efficacy Assessments 
6.3.1.  Pain Intensity Assessment  
Subjects will be asked to evaluate their current pain level at scheduled timepoints after surgery. 
Subjects will receive training by the site on how to provide pain intensity assessments. 
Pain intensity scores will be assessed using an 11-point NRS (0 –10) where 0 represents “no 
pain” and 10 repres e nts “worst pain imaginable” (Breivik 2008) . NRS scores will be recorded 
first at rest (NRS-R) and then with activity (N RS-A).  
For NRS-R assessments, subjects should be seated/recumbent with the surgically attended leg 
elevated or lying supine. Measurements should be obtained after the subject is in the resting 
position for at least 5 minutes. 
For NRS- A assessments, subjects should be seated with the plantar surface of the ball of the 
surgically attended foot touching the floor (no weight-bearing; see photo below).

Confidential 42 If a subject withdraws from the study before 72 hours, NRS-R and NRS- A pain intensity scores 
will be recorded at the time of withdrawal.  See Appendix C. 
6.3.2.  Use of Opioid Medications 
6.3.2.1. Opioid Rescue Medication Through 72 Hours 
The name, dose, and route as well as the date and time of administration of any opioid rescue 
medication must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF  from Time 0 through 72 hours. For more 
information on opioid rescue medications permitted, see Section 3.1.3 . 
6.3.2.2. Subject Daily Diary of Opioid Use From 72 Hours Through Day 28 
Subjects will be provided a daily diary to record if they take any opioid medication from 
72 hours through Day 28 (yes or no).  
6.3.3.  Discharge Readiness 
Discharge readiness will be assessed using the MPADSS criteria (Chung, 1995) . See 
Appendix E. 
Note: This study instrument assesses a subject’s potenti al readiness to be discharged and should 
be repeated at all scheduled timepoints. It is not meant to be used to decide on whether or not to 
discharge a subject from the study. Subjects are required to remain in the hospital/research 
facility for 72  hours. 
6.3.4.  Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Pain Control 
Subjects will be asked to evaluate the ir pain control over the preceding 24 hours using a 4-point 
PGA scale where 0 represents “ poor” and 3 represents “excellent”  (Rothman, 2009) . See 
Appendix D for the PGA scale.

Confidential 43 6.4. Safety Assessments 
6.4.1.  Adverse Events 
All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through the Safety Follow-Up on Day 42. See Section 8 for details. Clinically significant 
post-treatment findings for laboratory results, vital signs, ECGs, or X-rays should be recorded as 
AEs. LAST signs or symptoms, abnormal physical examination findings and wound healing 
abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs. 
6.4.2.  Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity Assessment 
A LAST assessment questionnaire is provided (see Appendix H) to monitor for early neurologic 
and cardiac signs and symptoms of LAST (Vasques, 2015 ). 
Subjects should be assessed with this questionnaire on a regular basis to identify early stages of 
toxicity to determine whether treatment should be initiated. If a subject has signs or symptoms 
that may be attributed to LAST, vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECG, and blood sample 
collection for PK must be performed. If symptoms are present at a timepoint when 1 of these 
assessments is not scheduled, an unscheduled assessment must be performed. 
6.4.3.  Physical Examinations 
Scheduled physical examinations will include an evaluation of the following: head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat as well as CV, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, dermatological, and 
musculoskeletal systems. 
Baseline height and weight measurements, and calculation of BMI (see Appendix B) will be 
conducted.  
Unscheduled physical examinations may also be performed (the extent of which is to be 
determined by the Investigator) at any time during the study if indicated by a change in the 
subject’s medical history or condition.  
6.4.4.  Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure,  resting heart rate, respiration rate, 
and body temperature. Subjects should be in a supine position (includes sitting in a recliner 
chair) for at least 5 minutes before taking vital signs.  
6.4.5.  12-Lead Electrocardiograms 
Screening and post-treatment ECG s will be obtained for all subjects.  Standard digital 12-lead 
ECG s will be performed in triplicate. Subjects should be in the supine position (includes sitting 
in a recliner chair) for at least 5 minutes before each initial E CG recording. The mean of the 
3 ECGs will be used as the baseline result. 
The ECG tracings will be reviewed by a central reader. Refer to the Cardiac Safety Study 
Ma
nual for instructions on collecting and transmitting results.

This section lists the study procedures and assessments that will be performed at scheduled 
timepoints during the study. See Section 6 for information on study procedures and assessments. 
Unless there is a safety concern, every effort should be made to avoid protocol deviations. For 
pain assessments at timepoints when the subject is asleep, an attempt should be made to wake the 
subject. If there is no response, the assessments at these timepoints may be recorded as “Not 
Done .” Assessments that can be done without waking the subject (eg, blood collection for PK) 
should be completed. Additional visits and/or assessments are permitted if clinically indicated in 
the opinion of the Investigator. 
When the following assessments are scheduled at the same timepoint, it is recommended that 
they be performed in this order: 
 NRS-R pain intensity assessment  (subjects should be seated/recumbent with the 
surgically attended leg elevated or lying supine; measurements should be obtained 
after the subject is in the resting position for at least 5 minutes) 
 PGA of pain control assessment 
 Vital signs 
 12-lead ECG 
 NRS-A pain intensity assessment (subjects should be seated with the plantar surface 
of the ball of the surgically attended foot touching the floor [no weight bearing]) 
 LAST assessment 
 Blood sample collection 
 Physical examination 
 Wound healing assessment 
 Bone healing assessment (X-ray) 
7.1. Screening Period 
After providing written informed consent, potential study subjects will undergo Screening 
procedures to confirm eligibility to participate in the study. Screening procedures must be 
performed within 2 8 days prior to surgery.  The Investigator must evaluate the subject’s medical 
history and the results of all Screening assessments to determine study eligibility before the 
subject is randomized.  
Screening procedures and assessments will include the following: 
 Urine drug screen 
 Urine pregnancy test (female subjects of child-bearing potential only) 
 Medical history 
 Demographic recording 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 47  Physical examination (including weight, height, and BMI calculation) 
 Vital signs measurements 
 12-lead ECG (in triplicate) 
 Blood sample collection for the hematology and serum chemistry 
 Subject training for pain intensity assessments 
 AE recording (from the time the subject signs the ICF) 
 Prior and concomitant medication recording (from the time the subject signs the ICF) 
The urine drug screen and urine pregnancy test should be performed first, and the results should 
be confirmed as negative prior to performing any additional assessments. A subject who fails the 
drug test may be rescreened at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects with a positive drug 
screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a positive 
drug test (eg, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 
benzodiazepine for anxiety disorder) may be eligible for participation in the study. Any other 
screening laboratory test result that do es not meet the eligibility criteria may not be repeated 
without the Sponsor's approval. 
All subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may 
be done up to 1 business day prior to the day of surgery. Subjects do not need to be present for 
randomization to occur. 
7.2. Treatment and Postoperative Observation Period 
7.2.1.  Day of Surgery (Day 1) 
7.2.1.1. Prior to Surgery 
On Day 1, subjects will be reassessed for study eligibility. This includes a urine drug screen test 
(all subjects) and urine pregnancy test (female subjects of child-bearing potential only).  Results 
should be confirmed as negative prior to performing any additional assessments. 
Subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria can continue on study and will be admitted 
to the surgical unit.  The following additional study procedures and assessments will be 
performed before surgery: 
 Vital signs measurements 
 Subject training for pain intensity assessments (refresher training) 
 AE recording  
 Prior and concomitant medication assessment 
7.2.1.2. Surgery and Study Drug Administration 
Subjects will undergo a unilateral simple bunionectomy under regional anesthesia (no more than 
20 mL of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine administered as a Mayo block; epidural or spinal 
anesthesia is not permitted). Sites should follow intraoperative safety monitoring in accordance 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 48 with ASA Standards for Basic Anesthetic Monitoring (American Society of Anesthesiologists, 
2015 ), which is consistent with the European Board of Anaesthesiology (EBA) recommendations 
for minimal monitoring during Anaesthesia and Recovery (for review in 2018) (EBA UEMS, 
2016 ). The start and stop time of surgery and additional surgical details (including the length of 
the sur
gical incision) should be recorded in the eCRF. 
Subjects will be administered study drug unless they experience a clinically significant event 
during surgery (eg, excessive bleeding, hemodynamic instability) that would render the subject 
medically unstable or complicate their postoperative course. Study drug will be administered via 
local administration into the surgical site at the end of the surgical procedure, but prior to wound 
closure. See Section 5.5 for complete details on the study drug administration technique. 
The start and stop times of study drug dosing will be recorded in the eCRF. Details of 
administration will be recorded on a worksheet,  which will be used in the dictation of the 
surgical notes and will become part of the source document. Note:  The start of study drug 
administration will be considered as Time 0  for all efficacy, safety,  and PK assessments.  
Placement of the last suture will be considered the end of surgery.  
Concomitant medications used during surgery will be recorded (note that IV fluids and oxygen 
are not required to be recorded unless being used to treat an AE).  AEs will also be recorded. 
After immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the PACU.  
7.2.2.  Postoperative Assessment Period (Up to 72 Hours) 
Subjects will remain in the hospital/research facility for 72  hours after study drug administration. 
Study procedures and assessments that will be performed are listed below. 
All timepoints are referenced to the start of study drug administration. Actual times will be 
recorded for all events, and any deviation outside the specified ranges must be clearly 
docum ented in the subject’s study records.

(±15 min), 8 and 12 hours (±30 min), 24 hours (±1 h ), 36 and 48 hours (±2 h ), 60 and 
72 hours (±4 h) 
 Note: If a subject requires rescue medication before the 1-hour pain intensity 
assessments, then an unscheduled NRS- R pain score followed by an NRS- A pain 
score must be obtained before administering the first dose of rescue medication. 
These do  not replace the 1-hour NRS-R and NRS-A assessments. 
 PGA of pain control assessment:  24 hours (±1 h), 48  hours (±2 h), and 72 hours

 AE recording:  (Note: the start date and time of all AEs during this timeframe must 
be recorded) 
 Concomitant medication recording:  (Note: the start date and time of all 
concomitant medications during this timeframe must be recorded) 
 Use of rescue medication recording:  Any time between study drug administration 
and 72 hours (Note: the start date and  time of all rescue medications during this 
timeframe must be recorded. ) 
7.2.3.  End of the Postoperative Assessment Period 
After the 72-hour assessments have been completed, the subject may be discharged if medically 
ready. The time of discharge will be recorded. If a subject is not ready to be discharged due to an 
AE, it should be recorded on the AE eCRF as per Section 8.3.1 . If a subject is ready for 
discharge but is not discharged for any reason other than AE, the reason should be recorded on 
the eCRF. 
Subjects who are not medically ready for discharge at 72 hours may receive the same rescue 
medication as outlined in Section 3.1.3  to treat postoperative pain until discharge. 
For subjects who are medically ready for discharge at 72 hours, oral acetaminophen (no more 
than 1000 mg every 6 hours as needed) should be recommended for postoperative pain. If a 
subject received 10 mg or more of oxycodone in the 12 hours prior to discharge, the subject 
should be provided with a prescription for oxycodone (up to 10 mg PO q4h as needed, #15, no 
substitutions).  See Appendix G for instructions on postoperative pain management for subjects 
medically ready for discharge. 
Subjects will be given a diary to complete daily and record if they take any opioid medication

Confidential 53 8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING 
Investigators are responsible for the detection and documentation of events that meet the 
definition of an AE, SAE, suspected adverse reaction, serious suspected adverse reaction, 
unanticipated adverse device effect, or unanticipated problem, as provided in this protocol.  
Investigators must review the HTX-011  IB so as to be aware of the safety-related events, which 
may be anticipated with its use. Investigators will also be versed in the latest standard of care 
guidelines.  
8.1. Definition of Safety Parameters 
8.1.1.  Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study drug. Any abnormal laboratory value, 
vital sign result, or ECG or X-ray findings deemed clinically significant by the Investigator, 
regardless of causal relationship, must be reported as an AE. LAST signs or symptoms, abnormal 
physical examination findings and wound healing abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs.  
A clinical diagnosis, rather than the changes in laboratory analyte or other assessment, should be 
recorded (eg, anemia rather than low hemoglobin value). 
Examples of AEs include the following: 
 Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication 
under study. 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (eg, abnormal physical examination 
finding). 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, 
unless nonserious or serious sequelae occur). 
 The following abnormal laboratory results: 
 Any laboratory abnormality suggestive of a new disease/organ toxicity or a 
worsening of a pre-existing condition. 
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have investigational 
product interrupted or discontinued.  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific treatment 
for the lab abnormality. 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 54  Any laboratory abnormality that required additional monitoring and follow-up 
visits.  
 Any laboratory abnormality requiring further diagnostic investigation. 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
 Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s ) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not 
worsen . 
 The disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a 
greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition . 
 Transient paresthesia that is considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to 
occur as a long-acting local anesthetic wears off). 
8.1.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death. 
 A life-threatening AE (ie, presented an immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.) 
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
The following events do not meet the definition of an SAE: h ospitalization for elective treatment 
of a pre-existing condition that does not worsen from baseline, hospitalizations for a standard 
procedure for study drug administration and routine monitoring of the studied indication not 
associated with any deterioration in condition, social or convenience admission to a hospital, 
prolong
ation of a hospitalization for social or convenience reasons not associated with the 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 55 occurrence of an AE, or hospitalization or an emergency room visit that lasts less than 24 hours 
that does not meet the criteria of an important medical or a life-threatening event. 
According to 21 CFR 812.3(s), an unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, 
a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects . 
8.1.3.  Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by the study drug. 
8.1.4.  Definition of a Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 
A serious suspected adverse reaction is any suspected adverse reaction that is determined to be 
serious, based on the outcomes of a SAE described in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.1.5.  Definition of Unanticipated Problems 
Unanticipated problems are incidents, experiences, or outcomes that meet all of the following 
criteria: 
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the research 
protocol and informed consent document approved by the Ethics Committee (EC; 
includes Institutional Review Boards [IRBs], Independent Ethics Committees [IECs], 
and Research Ethics Boards [REBs]) and (b) the characteristics of the participant 
population being studied. 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by the procedures involved in the research). 
 Suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized. 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.2. Classification of Adverse Events 
8.2.1.  Severity of Adverse Event s 
The Investigator will assess the severity of each AE based on his/her clinical judgment using one 
of the following categories:  
 Mild: Event is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, and does 
not interfere with everyday activities.  
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 56  Moderate:  Event results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning. 
 Severe:  Event interrupts a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening 
or incapacitating. 
8.2.2.  Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator will assess the relationship of each AE to study drug based on his/her clinical 
judgment. The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
doc
umentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 
All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study drug 
must always be suspect.  The Sponsor’s assessment of relationship may differ from the 
Investigator’s assessment.  
Relationship to study drug will be assessed according to the following guidelines: 
 Possibly r elated: The AE is known to occur with the study drug, there is a reasonabl e 
possi
bility that the study drug caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the study drug and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE. 
 Unlikely related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
stud
y drug caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study drug 
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for initially reporting an SAE, it is 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
entering the information into the eCRF or completing the SAE reporting form, in the event 
electronic data capture (EDC) is not available. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The Investigator may change his or 
her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and amend the SAE information 
accordingly in the eCRF or the SAE reporting form, as applicable. 
8.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up 
8.3.1.  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Monitoring 
All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through the Safety Follow-Up on Day 42. Note: the AE start time, as well as the date, 
must be recorded during the 72-hour postoperative period. After this period, only the start date 
must be recorded. 
For subjects who received study drug, if an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurs 
after the subject’s study participation and the Investigator considers the event to be possibly 
related to the study drug, the Investigator needs to report the SAE to the Sponsor a s described in 
Section 8.4.1 . 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 57 8.3.2.  Follow-Up of Events 
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the Investigator is required to follow each subject 
proactiv ely and provide further information on the subject’s condition . All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact and designated as ongoing will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits or contacts.  
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until the event resolves, the 
condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged by the Investigator to be 
no longer clinically significant (unless the subject is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent). 
The Investigator will assess the outcome of each AE using the following categories: 
 Resolved:  The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae. An event 
(either serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject 
experienced no restrictions. Examples include stent placement for coronary artery 
disease (a device implanted is not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a 
sequela), a postoperative wound infection, or an upper respiratory tract infection. 
 Resolved with sequelae:  The event has at least one secondary outcome that may 
result in permanent disability, functional limitation, or both. Such sequelae are 
usually limited to SAEs. Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop 
(foot drop is not the intended outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in 
paralysis, or emboli formation after a bacterial infection resulting in a renal infarct 
and loss of renal function. 
 Not resolved:  At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in 
intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown. 
Examples include headache, low-grade fever, or nausea. 
 Unknown:  The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to 
follow-up,  and the status of the event is unknown. 
 Death 
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves (ie, when the event no longer meets any of the 
seriousness criteria), the condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged 
by the Investigator to be no longer clinically significant (unless the subject is lost to follow-up or 
withdraws consent). The Investigator will ensure that follow-u p information provided to the 
Sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic 
examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature 
of the event, the cause of the event, or both. New or updated information will be recorded as 
outlined in Section 8.4.1 . 
8.4. Reporting Procedures 
8.4.1.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor 
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE due to any 
cause that occurs during the course of this study, regardless of relationship to study drug, he/she 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 58 must notify the Sponsor by entering the SAE information into the eCRF within 24 hours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the SAE . 
If EDC is not available, the Investigator must complete an SAE reporting form and email it to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the SAE . The Investigator 
must also enter the SAE information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter. 
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc.com  
In the initial email, the Investigator must provide to the Sponsor the following eCRF pages, 
completed to the greatest extent possible: 
 AE record 
 Medical history 
 Prior and concomitant medications 
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, 
or medical reports relevant to the SAE. 
EDC is the primary method for notification of SAE information. In rare circumstances and in the 
absence of email capacity, notification by fax or telephone is acceptable, with a copy of the SAE 
reporting form sent by overnight mail. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need 
for the Investigator to complete the SAE information in the eCRF within the time frames 
outlined. 
If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she must not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the Sponsor of the event. The SAE must be 
updated when additional information is received. Follow-up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the Sponsor using the same timelines as for an initial report. 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor by reporting any unanticipated adverse device effect 
within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the effect. 
8.4.2.  Reporting Unanticipated Problems to the Sponsor 
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an unanticipated 
problem, he/she must notify the Sponsor by completing an Unanticipated Problem Form and 
emailing it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
p
roblem . 
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc.com  
The following information will be included with u nanticipated p roblem reporting: 
 Protocol identifying information: protocol title, protocol number, and Investigator’s 
name.  
 A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome. 
 An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an u nanticipated problem.   
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc.

Confidential 59 It is the Investigator’s responsibility to report unanticipated p roblems to the Sponsor and their 
EC, as required by local regulations. 
8.4.3.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements 
The Investigator must promptly report all SAEs and unanticipated adverse device effects to the 
S
ponsor in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 8.4.1 . The Sponsor has a legal 
responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory 
agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs 
by the Investigator to the appropriate project contact for SAE receipt is essential so that serious 
suspected adverse reactions that are either unexpected or observed with increasing occurrence be 
reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects 
are met. 
Investigator letters are prepared according to Sponsor policy and are forwarded to the 
Investigators as necessary . An Investigator letter is prepared for any suspected adverse reaction 
that is attributable to study drug, serious, and unexpected. The purpose of the Investigator letter 
is to fulfill specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation. 
The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the EC. 
The Sponsor is responsible for informing ECs, Investigators, and regulatory authorities of 
finding that could adversely affect the safety of subjects or affect the conduct of the study. 
Events will be reported to regulatory authorities in accordance with expedited and period 
reporting requirements.  
8.4.4.  Pregnancy Reporting 
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be withdrawn from the study 
immediately. Female subjects who become pregnant within 28 days after receiving study drug 
should also notify the Investigator. The Investigator must attempt to follow the pregnancy to 
term or termination in order to report on outcome and health status of mother and child. 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any pregnancy by completing a Pregnancy Form  and 
emailing it to the Sponsor within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the 
pregnancy . 
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc.com  
8.5. Safety Oversight 
The internal, blinded Product Safety and Risk Management Committee will monitor safety data 
on a
 periodic basis throughout the study (ie, monthly unless more frequent monitoring is 
necessary due to high enrollment or safety concern), including regular review of ECG findings,  
AEs, LAST assessments, wound healing assessments, bone healing assessments, and SAEs.  
The stopping criteria, enrollment suspension or study termination for safety issues, are provided 
in Section 13.5.

10.1. General Considerations 
All efficacy and safety data will be listed by subject. Unless otherwise specified, Baseline is 
defined as the last observed measurement, whether scheduled or unscheduled, prior to study drug 
administration. All safety and efficacy endpoints will be summarized by treatment group. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of subjects with data (n), mean, SD, 
median, minimum, and maximum. Selected continuous variable summaries will also include the 
SE. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. 
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical hypothesis testing will be two- sided using α = 0.05. 
1
0.2. Determination of Sample Size 
Based on a previous Phase 2 study of HTX-011 in subjects undergoing unilateral simple 
bunionectomy, estimates of the relevant parameters for each of the primary and key secondary 
endpoints are as follows: 
Parameter  Saline 
Placebo  Bupivacaine 
HCl HTX -011  
60 mg/1.8  mg 
Pain intensity AUC 0-72: Mean (SD)  425 (175)  425 (175)  325 (175)  
Opioid consumption (mg): Mean (SD)  30 (25)  30 (25)  20 (20)  
Proportion of opioid -free subjects  5% 10% 25% 
Assuming these estimates and using Satterthwaite’s t -test with α = 0.05, 2 -sided for the 
continuous endpoints and Fisher’s exact test with α = 0.05, 2 -sided for the categorical endpoints, 
150 subjects in the HTX-011 group, 150 subjects in the bupivacaine HCl active control group,  
and 100 subjects in the saline placebo control group provide at least 90% power to detect a 
statis
tically significant difference between the HTX-011 group and each of the control groups for 
each of the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
10.3. Analysis Populations 
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population: All subjects who are randomized and receive study drug will be 
included in the ITT Population. This population will be used as the primary analysis population 
for all efficacy endpoints. The randomized treatment assignment will be used for analysis in this 
population. 
Per Protocol Population: All subjects in the ITT Population who do not receive a prohibited 
rescue medication prior to 72 hours and who have no important protocol violations prior to 
72 hours will be included in the Per Protocol Population. This population will be used for 
sensitivity analyses on the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
Safety Population: All subjects who receive study drug will be included in the Safety Population. 
This population will be used for all summaries of safety data.  The actual treatment received will 
be used for analysis in this population.

Confidential 62 10.4. Statistical Analysis Methods 
10.4.1. Disposition and Demographics 
The number and percentage of subjects in each analysis population will be summarized. Subject 
disposition, including the number of subjects screened, randomized, dosed, completing the 
72-hour postoperative observation period, completing Day 28, completing the Safety Follow-up 
on Day 42, and not completing the Safety Follow-up on Day 42 by reason for withdrawal will be 
summarized for the ITT Population. Subject demographics and baseline characteristics will also 
be summarized for the ITT Population and will include age, age category, sex,  race, ethnicity, 
height, weight, and BMI. 
10.4.2. Efficacy Analysis 
10.4.2.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary estimand to address the efficacy objectives is the mean AUC of NRS-A pain 
intensity scores through 72 hours (AUC 0-72) adjusted for use of opioid rescue medication via 
windowed worst observation carried forward (wWOCF), comparing the estimated treatment 
difference between HTX-011 and saline placebo using analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with 
missing data imputed via last observation carried forward (LOCF) for interval censored pain 
intensity scores and worst observation carried forward (WOCF) for right-censored pain intensity 
scores in the ITT Population. 
The primary analysis of AUC 0-72 of the NRS-A pain intensity scores will be carried out using an 
ANOVA model with treatment as the main effect, comparing HTX-011 with saline placebo at a 
significance level of 5%. Results will be expressed as mean AUCs and SDs, least-squares mean 
differences (LSMD) and SEs with associated 95% CIs, and p-values. To account for the duration 
effect of opioid rescue medication, the wWOCF method will be implemented as the primary 
analysis method for endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores.  In this method, pain intensity 
scores observed during the analgesic window (duration of effect) of any opioid rescue 
medication will be replaced with the worst (highest) postdose nonmissing NRS pain intensity 
score observed prior to the rescue medication window, with the following exception: if the NRS 
pain intensity score for a windowed observation is higher than the worst pre-window score, then 
it will not be replaced . Sensitivity analyses for endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores 
will analyze the data without adjustment for the effect of opioid rescue medications. 
10.4.2.2. Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Key secondary endpoints involving AUC of NRS-A will be analyzed similarly to the methods 
described for the primary endpoint.  
Total opioid consumption through 72 hours will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The 
Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to examine the assumption of normality. If this test is statistically 
significant (ie, p ≤0.05) then the assumption of normality is violated and the total postoperative 
opioid consumption during period of interest will be analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
Results will be expressed as median (range) and p-values. However, if assumption of normality 
holds (ie, Shapiro-Wilk p-value >0.05), then the total postoperative opioid consumption during 
period of interest will be analyzed using an ANOVA model with randomized treatment as the 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 63 main effect. Results will be expressed as means, SDs, and LSMD and SE with associated 95% 
CI, and p-values. 
The proportion of subjects who are opioid-free through 72 hours will be analyzed using Fisher’s 
exact test. Results will be expressed as the number and percentage of subjects meeting the 
relevant endpoint, differences in proportions with 95% CIs, and p-values.  
10.4.2.3. Study-Wise Type I Error Control 
To account for multiple hypothesis testing on  the primary endpoint and on each of the 4  key 
secondary endpoints, a strict testing hierarchy will be applied to control study-wise alpha level at 
0.05. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant (p ≤0.05) , then the first key secondary 
endpoint will be tested. If the first key secondary endpoint is statistically significant, then the 
second key secondary endpoint will be tested. Sequential testing will continue in this manner 
down the key secondary endpoint list until an endpoint fails to meet statistical significance, after 
which all subsequent key secondary endpoints will be considered exploratory. If the primary 
endpoint is not statistically significant, then all key secondary endpoints will be considered 
exploratory. 
  
 
 
 
10.4.2.5. Handling of Missing Data 
Due to the required 72-hour inpatient postoperative observation period, the amount of missing 
data is expected to be very low. For any missing data observed through 72 hours in subjects who 
complete the 72-hour postoperative observation period, NRS pain intensity scores will be 
imputed via LOCF, in which the most recent postdose value is used for a subsequent missing 
value. For subjects who do not have a postdose value prior to their first missing value, the 
median of the postdose values at the relevant timepoint from subjects with observed data in the 
same randomized treatment group will be used. Predose values will not be carried forward to 
postdose timepoints. In subjects who withdraw from the study prior to 72 hours, missing NRS 
pain i
ntensity scores through 72 hours that were to be collected following withdrawal will be 
imputed via WOCF, in which the worst (highest) NRS pain intensity score observed prior to 
withdrawal will be used for post-withdrawal values through 72 hours. Analyses that adjust for 
the effect of opioid rescue medication will perform wWOCF following LOCF/WOCF (ie, 
perform LOCF/WOCF first, then apply wWOCF). The number and percentage of missing NRS 
pain intensity scores will be summarized.  
10.4.3. Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses will be carried out on the Safety Population. All safety data will be listed and 
summarized by treatment group. 
AEs that occur between the time the subject signs the ICF and the start of study drug 
administration will be considered pretreatment AEs. AEs that start during or after study drug 
administration, or AEs with an onset prior to study drug administration that worsen after study 

Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 64 drug administration will be considered TEAEs. All TEAEs will be coded and tabulated by 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Incidence of TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized and 
presented in descending order of frequency according to the HTX-011 group. AEs leading to 
study withdrawal, if any, will be listed separately. 
Associated laboratory parameters such as hepatic profile, renal function, and hematology values 
will be grouped and presented together in summary tables. For each laboratory test, individual 
subject values will be listed and values outside of the standard reference range will be flagged. 
Shift tables will be produced showing the frequency of shifts from Baseline to the lowest and to 
the highest on-study value in and out of the normal range as well as by visit. Laboratory 
parameters will also be summarized by visit. 
The change from Baseline to each visit for each of the vital sign variables will be summarized. 
Abnormal vital sign values will be flagged and listed. Changes from baseline in ECG results will 
be summarized. 
Wound healing assessment results will be summarized at each timepoint. Bone healing 
assessment X-ray results will also be summarized. 
10.4.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plasma bupivacaine and meloxicam concentrations will be determined using validated liquid 
chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry assays. Concentrations will be calculated by 
interpolation from a calibration curve. An estimated C max and T max will be calculated using 
population PK modeling, which will be developed in non -linear mixed effects modeling 
(NONMEM) using data from previous HTX-011 clinical studies.

12.1. Regulatory Authority Approval 
The Sponsor will obtain approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regulatory agency in 
accordance with any applicable country specific regulatory requirements before any site may 
initiate the study in that country. 
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and all applicable regulatory 
requirements in accordance with ICH/GCP and in general conformity with the most recent 
version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
12.3. Ethics Committee Approval 
The Investigator or the Sponsor is responsible for submitting the following documents to the EC s 
for review and, if applicable, approval: study protocol, ICF(s), IB, recruitment materials, 
information about study compensation to subjects, and any information for presentation to 
potential subjects by ECs. 
The Investigator is responsible for providing the Sponsor with the written EC approval prior to 
commencing the study (ie, before shipment of study drug to the site). All amendments to the 
protocol require review and approval by the EC before the changes are implemented to the study. 
All changes to the ICF will be approved by the EC; a determination will be made regarding 
whether previously consented participants need to be re-consented. If any other information 
approved by the EC for presentation to potential subjects is amended during the study, the 
Investigator is also responsible for ensuring EC review and approval. 
Study sites must adhere to all requirements stipulated by their respective ECs. This may include, 
but not be limited to, notifying the EC of serious and unexpected AEs or other local safety 
reporting requirements, submitting a final status report, or providing a synopsis of the study 
report upon study completion. 
12.4. Informed Consent Process 
Note: All references to “subject” in this section refer t o the study subject or his/her legally 
authorized representative. 
The Sponsor (or its designee) will provide Investigators with a multicenter ICF for this study. 
Investigators may adapt the information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary 
(although it must reflect the required elements of informed consent specified in 21 CFR 
Part 50.25). The final ICF must be accepted by the Sponsor and approved by the EC. 
Investigators must provide the Sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final ICF before and after it 
is approved by the EC. If any new information becomes available that might affect subjects’ 
willingness to participate in the study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to 
the ICF, the Sponsor will provide Investigators with a revised ICF.

Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 67 Prior to participating in any study-related procedure, each subject must sign and date an 
EC-approved ICF written in a language the subject can understand. The ICF should be as 
nontechnical as practical and understandable to the subject. The ICF must provide the subject 
with all the information necessary to make an informed decision about their participation in the 
study, including the nature and intended purpose of the study, possible benefits, possible risks, 
disclosures of the subject’s per sonal and personal health information for purposes of conducting 
the study. The ICF details the requirements of the participant and the fact that he/she is free to 
withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without prejudice to his/her further medica l 
care. Before informed consent is obtained, the subject should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study . All questions must be answered to the 
satisfaction of the subject. 
Once signed, the original ICF will be stored i n the Investigator’s site file and made available for 
review by the Sponsor. Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the 
subject’s case history . All subjects will receive a copy of their signed and dated ICF. 
If the ICF is revised during the study and requires the subject to be re-consented, informed 
consent will be obtained in the same manner as for the original ICF. 
12.5. Confidentiality 
All information provided by Heron Therapeutics, Inc. and all data and information generated by 
the site as part of the study (other than a subject’s medical records) will be kept confidential by 
the Investigator and site staff. This information and data will not be used by the Investigator or 
other site personnel for any purpose other than conducting the study and will not be released to 
any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Sponsor . These restrictions do 
not apply to the following: 1) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the 
Investigator or site staff, 2) information that must be disclosed in confidence to an EC solely for 
the evaluation of the study results, 3) information that must be disclosed in order to provide 
appropriate medical care to a study subject, or 4) study results that may be published as 
described in Section 13.6. If a written contract for the conduct of the study is executed and that 
contract includes confidentiality provisions inconsistent with this statement; that contract’s 
confidentiality provisions shall apply rather than this statement; provided , however, that the 
confidentiality provisions in any written contract shall not be less restrictive than this statement.  
The Investigator agrees to comply with all applicable national, state, and local laws and 
regulations relating to the privacy of subjects’ health information . The Investigator shall ensure 
that study subjects authorize the use and disclosure of protected health information in accordance 
with the privacy regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
and in a form satisfactory to the Sponsor. 
The subject’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use 
during the study. Throughout the study, a subject’s source data will o nly be linked to the 
Sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation via a unique identification number. Copies of 
any subject source documents that are provided to the Sponsor must have certain personally 
identifiable information removed (ie, subject name, address, and other identifier fields not 
collected in the subject’s eCRF). At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a

13.1. Clinical Monitoring 
The Sponsor (or its designee) is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study. This 
includes ensuring the subject s’ rights and well-being are protect ed, the conduct of the study is 
within compliance of an approved protocol and GCPs, and the integrity of the data are accurate, 
complete and verifiable from source documentation. At regular intervals during the study, the 
Sponsor’s study m onitors will contact the study site via site visits, telephone calls, emails, and 
letters in order to review study progress and the eCRF completion and to address any concerns or 
questions regarding the study conduct. During monitoring visits, the following aspects of study 
conduct will be carefully reviewed: subjects’ informed consent documents, subject recruitment 
procedures, subjects’ compliance with the study procedures, source -data verification, drug 
accountability (unblinded monitor only), use of concomitant therapy by subjects, AE and SAE 
documentation and reporting, and the quality of data. 
13.2. Source Documents and Record Retention 
Each  study site will maintain study documents and records as specified in ICH E6, Section 8 
(Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial) and as required by regulatory and 
institutional requirements. These include, but are not limited to,  the following: the study 
protocol, eCRF, delegation of authority log, pharmacy dispensing records, drug accountability 
logs, AE reports, subject source data (original or certified copies), correspondence with health 
authorities and ECs, ICFs, monitoring visit logs, laboratory certification or quality control 
procedures, and laboratory reference rang es. Access to study documents and records will be 
strictly controlled (see Section 12.5). 
Study records must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. However, these 
documents should  be retained for a longer period  if required by applicabl e regulator y 
requirement s or if agreed to in the Clinical Trial Agreement. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor 
to inform the site as to when  these documents no longer need  to be retained.  
13.3. Management of Protocol Amendments and Deviations 
13.3.1. Protocol Modification 
The protocol cannot be modified except in a formal protocol amendment by the Sponsor. 
13.3.2. Protocol Violations and Deviations 
The Investigator will not implement any protocol deviation without agreement by the Sponsor 
except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. 
Protocol deviations fall into 2 categories: those with approval prior to the event (protocol 
exemptions) and those occurring during the course of the study without prior approval (protocol 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 70 violations). If an exemption from the protocol design (eg, a missed study visit or an unmet 
inclusion or exclusion criterion) is desired for an individual subject, other than those to eliminate 
immediate hazard, the Investigator must request an exemption from the Sponsor or designee. The 
Investigator will notify the EC of exemptions and deviations, as required by EC guidelines and 
site requirements. Exemptions (with rationale) will be documented at the site and in the Sponsor 
files. For any protocol violation, the site will document the protocol violation in the subject’s 
source documents. In the event of a significant violation, the site will notify the Sponsor or 
designee. Significant violations include, but are not limited to, those that involve fraud or 
misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study 
assessments. The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the regulatory authorities, if required. 
13.4. Financial Disclosure 
Investigators are required to inform the Sponsor of all disclosable financial interests or 
arrangements (including those of their spouse and dependent children), prior to study initiation at 
the site, at study completion,  and 1  year after study completion in accordance with 21 CFR 
Part 54. In addition, the Investigator or subinvestigators must promptly notify the Sponsor if 
ther
e are any reportable changes that occur during the above described period.  
Disclosable financial interests or arrangements, or the absence thereof will be recorded on the 
Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form. 
Any Investigator(s) added as investigational staff to the FDA 1572 form must complete the 
Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form at the start of his/her participation in the 
study. The Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form for any Investigator(s) leaving 
the study prior to completion will also be obtained. 
13.5. Stopping Criteria: Suspension or Termination of Study or 
Investigational Site 
13.5.1. Suspension of Study 
Enrollment will be suspended if the Sponsor discovers the occurrence of either of the following: 
 Any death for which a clear alternative cause (unrelated to study drug) is not readily 
apparent. 
 Three (3) non-fatal SAEs that are considered by the Sponsor to be possibly related to 
study drug, and that are either unexpected or for which a clear alternative cause is not 
readily apparent. 
13.5.2. Termination of Study or Investigational Site 
If the Sponsor, Investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that a study site should be closed, 
this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and Investigator(s). 
Reasons for terminating the study early or closing a site include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
Protocol No: HTX- 011-301 Version 3 Heron Therapeutics, Inc. 
Phase 3 bunionectomy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH 1) 
Confidential 71  If there is a suspension of the study and further investigation shows that any death or 
3 non-fatal SAEs are determined by the Sponsor to be related to study drug and pose 
an unacceptable risk to the study subjects, the study will be terminated. 
 Discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subjects.  
 Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, GCP regulations and 
guidelines, or local requirements. 
 Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements or an unacceptably high rate of 
missing, erroneous, or improperly collected data. 
 Data are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable. 
 Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the Investigator.  
 Sponsor decision.

MANAGEMENT FOR SUBJECTS MEDICALLY READY 
FOR DISCHARGE  
The following text should be read by the Investigator or designee to the subject at the time of 
discharge: 
You have completed the initial part of the study which required you to stay at the facility. You 
are now being discharged to go home. You will come back here again for check-up visits on 
Day 10 (approximately 1 week from now),  Day 28 (approximately 3½ weeks from now), and for 
a Safety Follow-Up on Day 42 (approximately 5½ weeks from now). 
While you are at home, if you experience any pain from your operation, please take up to 
2 over-the-counter extra-strength (500 mg) acetaminophen tablets (eg, Tylenol) every 6 hours as 
needed. Do not take more than 8 tablets (4000 mg) in a 24-hour period. If this does not control 
your pain, please call <<insert name and contact information>> so that we can talk about 
providing you with a prescription for something stronger, if needed. 
Do not take other acetaminophen-containing products that are available over the counter 
without first checking with your doctor. As an example, cold medicine over the counter may 
contain acetaminophen and may result in exceeding the daily dose limit of acetaminophen and 
can cause liver damage. 
NOTE: If a subject required 10 mg or more of oxycodone in the 12 hours prior to discharge, the 
subject should be provided with a prescription for o xycodone up to 10 mg PO q4h, #15, as 
needed. Pharmacists should be instructed that substitutions for any other opioid-containing 
product are not permitted.

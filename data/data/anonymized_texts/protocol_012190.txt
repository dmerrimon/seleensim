this proof of clinical concept (Po CC) and dose finding trial to define one or more 
suitable doses with respect to the efficacy and safety of BI 425809 for furt her 
testing in pivotal phase III trials in patients with schizophrenia on stable 
antipsychotic treatment. A set of six plausible dose response patterns is considered 
with pre -specified parameters. If the overall MCPMod test is statistically 
significant, r ejecting the null hypothesis of a flat dose response relation across 
doses for BI 425809 under study and placebo over 12 w eeks for the primary 
endpoint with a contrast test controlled for the family -wise type I error rate at one -
sided alpha=0.05, PoCC is established. After establishing the PoCC, a fitted model 
will be obtained via weighted model averaging across the significant models based 
on the Akaike Information Criterion and the target dose(s) can be determined from 
that model by incorporating informat ion on the minimum clinically relevant effect 
as well as safety information.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015(*) The Screening Visit has to be performed from -28 days to -7 days prior first drug administration
(**) Re-cons enting may become necessary when new relevant information becomes available and should be conducted 
according to the sponsor’s instructions .   
Patients who failed screening may repeat the screening phase once after discussion between investigator and sponsor. 
The patient who will be rescreened needs to be re -consented
***) Day of Randomization / Day of first intake of randomized medication
(****) Completion of patient participation also needs to be completed if the patient withdraws prematurely following 
randomization (see Section 3.3.3 )
1women of childbearing potential must perform urine (dipstick) pregnancy test at Visit 1 (Screening Visit), Visit 2, Visit 3, 
Visit 4, Visit 5 ,(e)EOT Visit .Urine pregnancy test can be performed more frequently if required by local regulation.
4An early End of Treatment (eEOT) Visit, as well as a Follow -up Visit 1 and 2, should be performed for any patient who 
discontinues study medication prematurely; the eEOT Visit should be completed as soon as possible after study medication
is stopped .  
5Follow -up visits are designed to capture withdrawal effects: immediate effects at1 week after last intake of trial medication 
and based onhalf-life, again at4 weeks after last intake of trial medication ). Follow -up visit 1 may be conducted as a 
phone visit.
6Informant ratings are needed for SCoRS and PANSS ratings. In person ratings are preferred whenever possible. However, 
if the informant is not available for in person ratings, telephone interview is acceptable. The informant must be available 
for a telephone intervie w at the visits indicated in the flowchart.
7Study procedures of Screening Visit (Visit 1), Visit 2, Visit 4 and (e)EOT Visit can be split into 2 sequential days. If the 
study procedures are split into 2 sequential days, the MCCB,   should be 
performed at the first day of the two sequential days (i.e., the day prior to Da y 1), and the psychopathologic assessments 
(e.g. SCoRS, PANSS) should be performed on the second day. 
8Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale baseline/screening scale
9Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale since-last -visit scale
13It is recommended that the 12-lead ECG is performed 3 -5 hours after intake of trial drug on visits 4 and (e)EOT.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan20151. INTRODUCTION
MEDICAL BACKGROUND 1.1
Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that is chron ic and disabling in its clinical course. It 
has been long hypothesized that deficits in glutamatergic signaling may  underl ie
schizophrenia, including negative and cognitive symptoms (R13-4521). Existing treatment 
options for schizophrenia (i.e. first- and second-generation antips ychotics) are primarily  
efficacious in treating positive sy mptoms and have limited efficacy  for treating the cognitive 
and negative s ymptoms. Inhibition of GLYT 1 aims at improving NMDA receptor 
hypoactivation in patients with schizophrenia by  increasing the concentration of the NMDA 
receptor co -activator gl ycine in the synaptic cleft, thereb yleading to improvement of 
negative and cognitive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia (as add -on thera py to 
antipsy chotics). 
Schizophrenia has a life -time prevalence of approximately  1%, with almost equal distribution 
worldwide and comparable incidence between men and women.
Schizophrenia is a heterogenous s yndrome defined by  hallucinations, delusions, social 
withdrawal, restricted emotional experiences and expressions, and disorganized behavior . 
Although the current diagnostic s ystems emphasize positive and negative sy mptoms of the 
illness, early  descriptions of schizophrenia viewed cognitive impairment as a core feature. 
Kraepelin described a wide range of cognitive deficits in characterizing the illness, including 
attention, memory , retention, association, mental efficiency , judgment, s yntax, as well as 
processes and fluidity  in thoughts (Ref: Kraepel in 1919 Dementia Praecox and paraphrenia ).  
Bleuer described deficits in associative thinking as a core feature of schizophrenia and 
viewed hallucinations as rather accessory  (Ref: Bleuler 1950 Dementia Praecox or the group 
of schizophrenias) .
Cognitive 
impairments are a core feature of schizophrenia and have been shown to be a major 
determinant of poor functional outcome. As a group, patients with schizophrenia perform 
significantl y worse than controls on almost all neuropsy chological tests. While many  
neurops ychiatric disorders are associated with some degree of cognitive dy sfunction, the 
impairments seen in schizophrenia tend to be more severe and more independent of 
symptomatic state ( R10-5111).
A meta-analy sisof more tha n 200 studies in Schizophrenia which included neurocognitive 
assessments between 1980 and 1997 reported an overall mean of about one standard 
deviation in cognitive performance compared to community  controls (R15-3853). Another 
meta -analysis of studies in the following decade produced similar magnitude of deviation 
from population norms ( R15-3854). T he magnitude of difference in composite cognition 
measures from health y volunteers is comparable or greater than the effect sizes reported for 
moderate to severe traumatic brain injury  (R15-3852 ).
Around 20-60% of the variance in functional outcome in schizophrenia is explained by  
cognitive performance ( R10-5094; R10-5096; R10-5100; R10-
5104).
Boehringer Ingelheim                                                                                                      28Mar 2019

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015As of y et, no drug ha sbeen approved for the treatment of cognitive impairment in
schizophrenia. Antipsy chotics have demonstrated mild beneficial effects on cognition in 
schizophrenia (R15-5596 ; R15-5580). However, antipsy chotics also adversely  affect some 
aspects of cognitive function, such as processing speed ( R15-5595).
Various glutamatergic agents have been tested for the treatment of schizophrenia. Targets 
include NMDA receptor co -factor gl ycine site, including agonists D -gycine, D -serine, and 
partial agonist D -cycloserine, as well as gl ycine transporters, such as sarcosine and bitopertin.
D-cylcoserine has shown modest reductions in negative s ymptom scores ( R15-5877), but in 
another stud y, it did not differentiate from placebo (R15-5838) . In the latter study , D-
cycloserine separated from placebo in improvement in cognitive function, driven by  outlier 
responders. When d -cycloserine was dosed once a week, there was signi ficant improvement 
in negative sy mptoms, most pronou nced in affective flattening and anhedonia ( R15-5584). D-
serine has also produced inconsistent results on positive, negative and cognitive sy mptoms of 
schizophrenia (R15-5615 ;R15-5578; R15-5639). Incon sistent results were seen from 
sarcosine trials as well ( R13-4524; R13-4448; R15-5616).
Conventional antipsy chotics (including both first- and second generation antipsy chotics) have 
only modest effects on cognitive performance (and also negative s ymptoms) and no drugs 
have yet been approved for the treatment of CIAS or negative s ymptoms.
Data from several cross -sectional and longitudinal studies suggest that ameliorating cognitive
deficits can benefit a range of functional measures, which may  have significant economic 
impact ( R10-5108). The potential to increase functional recovery  is therefore a major 
motivation for developing novel treatments for CIAS .
DRUG PROFILE 1.2
 In addition, the GLYT1 
inhibitor prototy pe sarcosine has shown to improve positive, negative, and cognitive 
symptoms in patients with schizophrenia ( R13-4447 ; R13-4524). It is therefore thought that
treatment with BI 425809 has the potential to improve cognitive functioning in patients with
schizophrenia. 
In a proof of clinical concept trial of another GLYT1 inhibitor, bitopertin, efficacy  signals 
were observed in negative sy mptoms of schizophrenia ( R13-4509) , but not replicated in 
phase III trials (R14-4313 ;R15-1273).

with the same mode of action (R13-4450; R13-4451; R13-4508). P otential risks associated 
with BI 425809 are transient visual disturbances, and somnolence. Based on class -effect, BI 
425809 may  have the potential to be associated with hemoglobin decrease (R15-1266; R15-

ASSESSMENT
RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL 2.1
This trial is designed to investigate whether BI 425809 as an add -on therapy  to antipsy chotics 
can improve cognitive s ymptoms in patients with schizophrenia. 
Ophthalmological sub-study :
This trial will further characterize the ocular safety  of BI 425809 and effects on 
ophthalmologic ph ysiology  in patients with CIAS. Therefore, a sub- set of patients will 
undergo special ocular safety  assessments. 
The sub- studiesaredescribed in detail in  Appendix 10.8 
of this protocol and implemented in the country (ies) planned to participate in this sub- study .
TRIAL OBJECTIVES 2.2
The primary  objectives of this trial are to provide proof of clinical concept (PoC C) and dose 
finding data in patients with schizophrenia on stable antipsy chotic treatment who are treated 
with oral once dail y administration of BI 425809 orplacebo. Other objectives of this trial are 
to assess the safet y 
The PoCCand dose finding are achieved through the primary  endpoint comparison (mean 
change from baseline in composite MCCB score at Week 12) of the four BI 425809 doses (2 
mg q.d., 5 mg q.d., 10 mg q.d. 
and 25 mg q.d. ) and placebo. A non -flat dose response 
relationship between the BI 425809 doses and placebo is tested using the multiple 
comparison procedures and modelling (MCPMod) approach (R10-1424; R15-1961).

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT 2.3
The overall safet y profile of BI 425809 is outlined in the current IB c02156531
Drug -related risks and safety  measures
Considering the chronic and severe disease burden of CIAS, the potential therapeutic benefits 
are assessed to outweigh the currently  understood potential risks of the treatment.
Based on non -clinical toxicology  data, clinical data from other compounds in the same class, 
and subjects exposed in phase I trials, BI 425809 is assessed to be generall y safe and well -
tolerated. Most common AEs were CNS related, headache being the most frequent. There is 
potential for BI 425809 to be associated with transient visual disturbances, and somnolence.  
These effects are understood to be mostly  mild to moderate and transient. 
Decreased hemoglobin is also considered to be a potential risk based on preclinical data and 
class effect; however, no clear decrease in hemoglobin was seen in BI 425809 -treated 
subjects compared to placebo in phase I trials so far (of up to 14 day sduration) .Patients with 
hemoglobin less than 120 g/L (12g/dL) in men or 115g /L (11.5g /dL) in women will be 
excluded from participation.
Administration with strong CYP3A inhibitor / inducers didsignificantl y impact the total 
exposure of BI 425809. As BI 425809 is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4, co -administration 
of moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are excluded during the participation 
inthis trial . Furthermore, as data of the DDI cocktail study  1346.22 suggest that BI 425809 is 
a mild CYP3A4 inducer, clinical monitoring is considered necessary when co-administering 
sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 at least to the highest tested dose of 25 mg BI 425809. 
S
ensitive CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index are excluded during this trial.
Regarding the potential risk while operating machinery , please refer to S ection 4.2.2.2 .
Consistent with the FDA draft guidance entitled "Suicidal I deation and Behavior: Prospective
Assessment of Occurrence in Clinical Trials", p rospective assessment of suicidal ideation and
behavior is included in this study  using the C -SSRS.
Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  is under constant surveillance by  
sponsor s and regulators. Therefore, this trialrequires timely  detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory alterations inselected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients´ 
safet y, see also S ection 5.3.6.1 .
Placebo Risks and Risks of stopping study  drug
There iscurrently no approved medication indicated for treatment of cognitive impairment in 
schizophrenia. Since an approved, effective comparator is not available for this study ,a 
placebo control group is being used in this study  design. It should be noted that all patients,
including those randomized to the placebo group, are permitted to remain on other
antipsy chotic and ps ychotropic medications.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015According to the medication assignment planned in this trial, 67% of the patients will receive
BI 425809 and 33% of patients will be assigned to placebo. Patients treated in this clinical 
trial should be in stable clinical status and on stable doses of antips ychotic and concomitant 
psychotropic medications. Parti cipation will not alter current disease treatment. Assi gnment 
to the placebo arm or sto pping the stud y drug during the treatment period is not associated 
with a higher risk since patients should remain on their stable treatment regimen. 
Additionally , BI 425809 targets the cognitive s ymptoms in schizophrenia and there is no 
preclinical evidence suggesting an effect on positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. 
Psychiatric events, posi tive and negative sy mptoms, and suicidality  will be monitored 
throughout the stud y to ensure that worsening of pre -existing conditions or any  newl y 
occurring events are detected and actions taken according to stopping criteria.
This is an experimental drug at an earl y stage of testing and therefore an individual benefit
cannot be guaranteed. Potential efficacy  
has been demonstr ated b y pre-clinical behavioral
cognition models. Given the acceptable safet y profile in nonclinical and toxicology  studies 
and the good tolerability  in clinical studies performed until this date , and careful monitoring 
planned during the stud y visits, the sponsor feels the risks to the participating patients are 
minimized and balanced by  a potential benefit due to the intensive medical care received. 
Additional justification is the possibility  to further develop treatment options to improve 
cognition as a 
treatment for an unmet medical need.

OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN 3.1
Figure 3.1:1 Trial design
This is a 12- week, multi- center , multi- national, randomized , double -blind, double dummy , 
placebo controlled parallel group trial in patients with schizophrenia . In total, 504 patients 
with schizophrenia on stable antipsy chotic treatment and meet the entrance criteria are
planned to be randomized into this trial.
Patients are enrolled in the trialonce informed consent has been signed. Patients suitable after
screening will be randomized to the 12
week treatment period assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1:1:2
to one of five arms:
- 2 mg BI 425809 
- 5 mg BI 425809 
- 10 mg BI 425809 
- 25 mg BI 425809

The randomized treatment will be double blind.
After completion of the 12-week double -blind treatment period, or following earl y 
discontinuation of trial medication at an y time point, patients will complete the 4 week 
follow -up period, with two follow up visits to capture immediate effects at 1 week after last

and other important participants, including their curricula vitae, will be filed in ISF.
DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 3.2
CONTROL GROUP(S)
A parallel group design was chosen for this trial to detect the effects of BI 425809 compared 
to placebo on cognition in patients with schizophrenia on stable antips ychotic treatment. The 
primary  anal ysis of efficacy  is planned for 12 weeks of treatment. The 1 and 4 weeks post -
treatment follow -
up visits is considered to be sufficient to evaluate the pharmacody namic 
effect of BI 425809 after discontinuation , to capture withdrawal effects and allow for 
assessment of reversibility  of any  unexpected side- effects .

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015Proof of clinical concept and dose finding are combined within this single phase II trial. In 
order to achieve both aims in an efficient way , i.e., with a comparabl y large success 
probability , the generalized MCPMod approach ( R10-1424) has been implemented as the 
statistical design. This approach is able to incorporate potential relationships between the 
different doses into the evaluations via optimal test contrasts which increases the probability  
of success compared with clinical multiple comparison procedures. MCPMod has been 
evaluated b y the EMA recently and is considered to be an efficient statistical methodology  
for model -based design and anal ysis of phase II dose finding studies under model uncertaint y 
(EMA qualification opinion). As a second step for designing the trial efficiently  the allocation 
ratio has been chosen to be 1:1:1:1:2 for the treatment groups compared with the placebo. 
Thereb y the success probability  of the trial is increased further compared to a balance d 
allocation ratio whilst keeping the risk of a false positive outcome at the same level. A 
sufficiently  broad set of candidate shapes for the dose -response relationship has been chosen 
including monotonic and non- monotonic options. Details of the statistical approach including 
the set of c andidate models as well as a sample size justification are give
n in Section 7.
SELECTION OF TRIAL P OPULATION 3.3
It is planned that around 80trial centres in 11countries will be participating in this trial and
a sufficient number of patients will be screened for the trial to ensure that 504 patients are 
randomized to trial treatment.
It is expected that approximately  5-10 patients will be randomized at each trial center.  If 
enrolment is delay ed, additional sites may  be recruited. 
To avoid differential center influence on study  results, permission to randomize more than 20 
patients per site must be obtained from the TCM. This will only  be allowed after a careful 
review of theenrolment status and of the site.
Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e., screening for the trial will stop at all 
centers when such a number of patients has been screened that it is anticipated that a 
sufficient number of patients will be randomized to trial treatment. Investigators will be 
notified when the appropriate number of patients has been screened and screening is 
complete, and will not be allowed to recruit additional patients for this trial. Patients who 
have completed Visit 1 procedures prior to notification of the termination of recruitment will 
be allowed to continue in the trial, if they  meet all entry  criteria and they  are able to follow 
the visit schedule specified in the protocol.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial(i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF at the investigational site irrespective of w hether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.

Removal of individual patients 3.3.4.1
An individual patient is to be withdrawn from trial treatment if:
The patient withdraws consent for st udy treatment or study  participation , without the need 
to justify  the decision
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational 
product (s) in the clinical judgement of the investigator´s (please refer to Section 4.2.2 ).
The patient can no longer be treated with trial medication for other medical reasons ( such 
assurgery , adverse events, other diseases, or pregnancy )
The patient exhibits suicidality , in the clinical judgement of the investigator or       
according to criteria below:
•Any suicidal behavior (i.e. actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt or 
preparatory  acts or behavior)
•Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 in the C -SSRS (i.e. active suicidal though twith 
intent but without specific plan, or active suicidal thought with plan and intent)
The patient needs to stop all current antipsy chotic or concomitant ps ychotropic
medications.
The patient’s disease state dramatically worsens, in clinical judgement of investigator
If a patient becomes pregnant during the trial the study  medication will be stopped, the
patient will be discontinued from the trial and the patient will be followed up until birth or
otherwise termination of the pregnancy . For further information, including the process for 
follow -up on the outcome of the pregnancy  please see Section 5.3.7.
A patient can be discontinued after discussion between Sponsor and Investigator if eligibility
criteria are being violated, or if the patient fails to comply  with the protocol (e.g. 
nonattendance at study  assessments).
Patients who discontinue or withdraw from the study  after randomization (Visit 2) will be
considered as “earl y discontinuations” and the reason for pre mature discontinuation must be
recorded in the eCRFs and in the source documents . The data will be included in the trial 
database and will be reported.
Patients who withdraw or discontinue from the trial after randomization will not be replaced.
Given the patient’s agreement, the patient will undergo the procedures for earl y treatment 
discontinuation and follow up as outlined in the Flow Chart and Section 6.2.3 .
For all patients the reason for withdrawal (e.g. adverse events) must be recorded in the 
(e)CRF. These data will be included in the trial database and reported .
Patients who drop out prior to randomization will be considered screening failures. They  will 
be recorded as screening failures in the Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and no further 
follow -up is required. The data will be included in the trial database and will be reported .

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan20154.1.2 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
During Visit 2 and after the patient ’seligibility  has been confirmed, the treatment will be 
assign edvia Interactive Response Technology  (IRT) . To facilitate the use of the IRT, the 
Investigator will receive all necessary  instructions .A cop y of the IRT manual will be 
available in the ISF.
Patients will be randomly  assigned, in a 1:1:1:1 :2ratio to either
i. 2mg BI 425809
ii. 5mg BI 425809
iii. 10mg BI 425809
iv. 25mg BI 425809
v. Placebo
Details on randomization are provided in Section 7.6.
Patient assignment to the treatment groups will be determined b y a computer generated
random sequence. Access to the randomization code will be controlled and documented. For
further details please refer to Sections 4.1.5.1 and 4.1.5.2.
The kit(s) corresponding to the as signed medication number(s) should be given to the patient
and the number of the kit(s) that was/were dispensed will be entered in the eCRF. 
Using this procedure, relevant parties will be blinded to the treatment group assignment.
4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
According to the result of previous trials, BI 425809 was well tolerated in healthy  subjects in 
single doses of upto 150mg and multiple doses of up to 75 mg bid (150mg per day ).
The doses selected for this trial cover the estimated therapeutic range and include a s afety
margin (Please refer to Section 1.2 for more details).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
Dispensing of kits for the double -blind treatment period will begin at Visit 2. Trial
medication kits will b e provided at Visit 2 and Visit 4. At each of these visits, medication
assignment will be provided through IRT. The assigned medication number(s) must be
entered in the eCRF, and the corresponding medication kit(s) must be given to the patient.
The duratio n of treatment is 12 weeks. At both Visit 2 and Visit 4 patients will receive one 
treatment kit containing supplies for 42 treatment day s (plus 7 day  reserve ).
Following the screening period, patients who qualify  according to entry  criteria will be
random ized to one of the fivetreatment groups of the treatment period to be evaluated as 
outlined in Table 4.1.4: 1 .

Patients should be instructed to take three tablets orally  with water and with or without food 
in the morning, except for visit dayswhere patients will be given their daily dose at the trial 
site. If a dose is missed by  more than 12 hours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose
should be taken as scheduled. On day s prior to a visit, the dose should be taken
approximately  24 hour s before the planned dose at the visit. 
The first dose of stud y medication will be taken at the end of Visit 2 under supervision of the 
investigator or site staff. The last dose of stud y medication should be taken on the day before 
the End of Treatment visit.
Patients should be instructed not to take their trial medication in the morning before visit
days, asthey will be dosed at the site. Patients who fail to do so should have the visit 
rescheduled as soon as possible , ideally  on the following day .
A do se reduction of BI 425809 is not possible.
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
Blinding 4.1.5.1
Patients, Investigator s and every one involved in trial conduct or analy sisor with an y other
interest in this double -blind trialwill remain blinded with regard to the randomized treatment 
assignments until after database lock .However, due to the requirements to report
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs), it may  be necessary for a
representative from BI’s drug safet y group to access the randomization code for individual
patients during study conduct. I n such cases, access to the code will only  be permitted by
authorized drug safet y representatives. Access to the code will be via the IRT sy stem.
The randomization code will be kept blinded by Clinical Tri
al Support up to database lock.
Please refer to Section 4.1.5.2 for the rules regarding breaking the code for an individual or 
for all patients in emergency  situations.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015Unblinding and breaking t he code 4.1.5.2
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the Investigator / Pharmacist / investigational drug 
storage manager via IRT. It must only  be used in an emergency  situation when the identity  of 
the trial drug must be known to the Investigator in order to provide appropriate medical 
treatment or otherwise as sure safety  of trial participants . 
However, due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSARs), it may  be necessary  for a representative from BI’s drug safet y group to access the 
randomization code for individual patients during study  conduct.
Each site receives a manual from the IRTprovider that contains instructions on how to 
unblind the treatment of a patient via the IRT(via 24 -hour Emergency  helpline ). If the code 
break for a patient is accessed, the Sponsor must be informed immediatel y. The reason for 
accessing the code break, together with the date, must be documented on the appropriate 
eCRF page and in the source doc uments . In case third part y needs to break the code, 
however, when the Investigator cannot be reached, the code can be opened by  calling 
emergency  code manager.
4.1.6 Packaging, 
labelling , and re -supply
Trial medicatio n will be labelled with the trial identification and medication code number. It
will be dispensed as indicated in the Flow Chart . At each dispensing, supplies for 42 
treatment day s (plus 7 day  reserve )will be given to the pati ent. 
Supply  and re -suppl y will be managed b y the IRTaccording to the IRT Manual.
For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.
4.1.7 Storage conditions
Drug supplies willbe kept in their original packaging and in a secure limited access storage 
area according to the recommended storage conditions on the medication label. A
temperature log must be maintained for documentation.
If the storage conditions are found to be outside the specified range, the local clinical monitor 
(as provided in the list of contacts) must be contacted immediately .

MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) will be used to evalua te the effects of 
BI 425809 on cognitive functions at Screening Visit (Visit 1), Randomization
Visit (Visit 2 ,baseline), Visit 4 and (early) End of Treatment visit ( e)EOT Visit.
MCCB comprises 10 tests, which assess 7 cognitive domains, including speed of processing, 
attention vigilance, working memory , verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem 
solving, and social cognition. ( R13-2347; R13-2373 )
Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) will be used to evaluate the every day
functional capacit y at Randomization Visit (Visit 2) and (earl y) End of Treatment visit
((e)EOT Visit).
SCoRS is a 20 -item interview -based assessment of cognitive deficits and the degree to which
they affect day-to-day functions. Each item is rated on a 4 -point scale. Higher ratings reflect a
greater degree of impairment. The composite score will be the average of non -missing
response. If five or more of the 20 items is missing, the composite score will be mis sing
(R13-2345; R16-4322).

5.3.3 Safety l aboratory parameters
The laboratory  tests listed in Table 5.3.3: 1 will be performed at the central laboratory  service 
provider. Patients do not have to be fasted for the blood sampling for the safety  laboratory . 
Instructions on collection, handling/ processing, and shipping of the samples will be provided 
in the investigator site file by  the central laboratory . For time points of laboratory  sampling 
refer to the Flow Chart .
Laborato ry results of the patients will be available to the respective investigator and to the BI 
Clinical Monitor of each country  (central laboratory  website), and selected abnormal 
laboratory  alerts will be sent automatically  to the sites and to the sponsor within 24 hours. 
Laboratory  values that are out of range should be commented on lab report print -outs and 
evaluated b y the investigator for clinical significance . Clinically  relevant abnormal laboratory  
test results must be confirmed using an unscheduled visit lab kit and should be repeated until 
normalization or stabilization or until an alternative explanation has been found.
Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  results should be reported b y the investigators in 
eCRF either on baseline condition (from V1 test) or on adverse event page (from subsequent 
visits test).
The following lab parameters will not be determined at each study visit:
TSH at screening onl y
Vitamin B12 a nd folate at screening only

5.3.4 Electrocardiogram
The 12-lead ECGs will be performed as scheduled in the Flow Chart .Twelve -lead ECGs (I, 
II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 – V6) will be recorded using equipment provided by  a central 
ECG vendor. The ECGs will be recorded for at least 10 second duration after the subjects 
have rested for at least 5 minutes in a supine position. Electrode placement will be performed 
according to the method of Einthoven/G oldber ger (ankles and wrists). At all time points 
indicated in the Flow Chart, single ECGs will be recorded. ECG recordings at planned time 
points may  be repeated for quality  reasons like alternating current artefacts, muscle 
movements and electrode disloc ation. I n this case the repeated ECG recordings will be used 
if quality  was better.
The investigator or a designee will evaluate whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and 
whether it is clinically significant, if abnormal. The electronic version of the ECG is regarded 
as source data. Dated and signed printouts will be stored in the patient’s medical file if there 
is no validated and certified e -medical record for ECG data.

All ECGs will be transmitted electronically  to the central ECG vendor in order to enable a 
centralized and independent re- evaluation of all 12 -lead ECGs. A centralized and 
independent re -evaluation will be done . Abnormalities detected during this centralized ECG 
evaluation will not necessarily  qualify  as AE.
Central evaluation on individual ECG level will be performed b y the vendor and a report will

5.3.5 O ther safety parameters
Assessment of disease state 5.3.5.1
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) will be used to evaluate the disease state. It
contains 30 -items including seven positive sy mptom items, seven negative symptom items
and 16 general ps ychopathology s ymptom items. Each item is scored on the same seven-
point
severit y scale. Fourteen of the PANSS items require input from an informant. A trained rater
interviews the patient and the informant, estimated to take 30- 40 minutes for evaluating the
subjects’ disease state at Screening Visit (Visit 1), Visit 2, Vis it 4 and (e)EOT Visit. If the
patient’s disease state dramatically  worsens, the patient should be withdrawn from the trial
(Please refer to Section 3.3.4.1 ). An y person who has been capable of observing the patient
over t he past week may  act as the informant. It is recommended that the informant should
interact with the subject at least 2 times a week. If the informant is not available for in person
interview at the scheduled visit, telephone interview is acceptable.
Asses sment of suicidality 5.3.5.2
Suicidal risk is assessed by  the eC -SSRS (electronic version) .
The C -SSRS is a semi -structured, investigator -rated interview, developed by  clinical experts
in cooperation with the FDA, assessing both suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. I t does
not give a global score, but provides some categorical and some severity  information
specificall y for behavior and ideation. The computer -automated eC -SSRS is a self -rated
version of the C -SSRS using phone. Subjects who do not have suicidal behavior or ideation 
will answer a limited number of questions and will usually  complete the assessment in about 
3 minutes. Subjects with significant suicidal ideation or behavior may  require up to 10 
minutes answering all relevant questi ons. This assessment should be conducted early  in the 
visit to provide sufficient time for the report to be received at the trial site prior to subject 
departure. At the conclusion of each assessment, the site will receive an eC-SSRS Findings 
Report via em ail or fax. The report presents the findings for suicidal ideation, intensity  of 
ideation, suicidal behavior , and lethality  / medical damage (for actual suicide attempts only ).

eCSSRS will be administered at the screening visit (using the ‘screening / baseline’ version)
with the aim to exclude subjects with active moderate or severe sy mptomatology  within a
specified time prior to the screening visit. The life time history of suicidal ideation and 
behavior will also be recorded. After the screening visit the assessment ‘since last visit’ will
be performed at each clinic or phone visit (‘since last visit’ version). The investigator is to 
review positive and negative reports for plausibility  and clinical relevance. Doubtful reports 
may be repeated or reports may  be validated by  a consulting ps ychiatrist .In ca ses when 
assessments need to be validated, the investigator -rated paper CSSRS questionnaire is to be 
used by  a psy chiat rist trained and certified for this questionnaire in order to collect data in a 
systematic way . The investigator rating on investigator -rated CSSRS will supersede the 
findings from the telephone interview. 
If there is a confirmed positive report of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation ty pe 4 or 5 
after start of trial, the investigator is to immediately interview the subject during the clinic 
visit, and/ or is to consult a psy chiatrist. If the positive report is confirme d, appropriate
actions for the subject’s safet y have to be initiated.
5.3.6 Assessment of adverse events
Definitions of AEs 5.3.6.1
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have 
to have a causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal prod uct.
Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may  arise
from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from
occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include offlabel
use, overdose, misuse, abuse a nd medication errors.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which:
results in death,
is life -threatening,
requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalis ation,
results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,

or
is to be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgment which may  jeopardize the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions.
Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypot hetically  might ha ve caused death 
if more severe.
All reports of suicidal ideation ty pe 4 or 5 and all reports of suicidal behavior from 
prospe ctive monitoring in CSSRS (see Section 5.3.5. 2for details) that occur after thebaseline 
visit are also considered to be life -threatening and must be reported as SAEs by  the
investigator.
For each negative report (suicidal ideation ty pe 1, 2 or 3) after start of the trial, the
investigator is to decide based on clinical judgment whether it represents an adverse event 
(AE) as defined in the protocol, and if it is considered an AE then it must be reported 
accordingl y.
For ‘Self -injurious behavior , no suicidal intent’ (Ty pe 11) standard AE / SAE reporting rules 
are to be applied.
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between the discontinuation of the drug and mu st be reported 
as described in S ection 5.3.7 Adver se event collection and reporting, subsections “AE 
collection” and “ AE reporting to sponsor and timelines”.
For Japan only : The following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any  other 
reason”. An AE which possibly  leads to disability will be reported as an SAE.
AEs considered “Always Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by  their nature, can alw ays be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the crite ria of an SAE as given 
above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the RDC . A copy  of the latest list of 
“Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided to y ou upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described in Section 5.3.7.
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compou nds in the same class. AESI

timeframe that applies to SAE, see Section 5.3.7.
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  the following alterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters: 
an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
marked peak aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided via the 
RDC -system.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator shoul d make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .
Intensity of AEs
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild : Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as conco mitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history .
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational pr oduct 
administered and the AE.
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE.
5.3.7 Adverse event collection and reporting
AE Collection
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) / eCRF by the 
Investigator:
From signing the informed consent onwards through the Residual Effect P eriod (REP)
until the individual patient´s end of trial :
all AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESIs .

report relevant SAEs and relevant AESIs of which the investigator may  become aware of.
Figure 5.3.7: 1 Collection and rep orting of AEs/SAEs during the study
The REP is defined as 11days after the last trial medication application. All AEs which 
occurred through the treatment phase and throughout the REP will be considered as on 
treatment (please alsosee Section 7.3.4 ). Events which occurred after the REP will be 
considered as post treatment events.
AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours ) to the 
Sponsor’s unique entry  point (country  specific contact details will be provided in the I SF). 
The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In spe cific occasions 
the Investigator could inform the Sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
Before administration of study  medication at Visit 2, site staff will remind patients to report 
“any unusual visual perception they may experience”. If patients report a change in 
perception or an y vision -related AE, site staff must record the patient’s verbatim description 
in the source documents and report it in the same way  in the CRF (and SAE for m, if
applicable) . A local ophthalmology  assessment will be required if any  visual AE is rated as 
moderate or severe by  the subject or at the discretion of the PI . The ophthalmologist will act 
as aconsultant to the Investigator and may offer advice on the proper management and
treatment for the reaction.
In case of anemia with unknown reason as measured b y the central laboratory the investigator 
should consult with an internist. Any  clinically  relevant finding from the internist´s 
consultation should be r eported as an AE.
For Japan: All SAEs and AESI s must be reported immediately  to the head of the trial site.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
(e)CRF pages and the BI SAE form, e.g. onset, end date, intensity , treatment required, 
outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug(s). The Investigator 
should determine the causal relationship to the trial medication andthe trial proced ures 
outlined under Section 6.2.
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the (e)CRF and SAE form (if 
applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if th ey are 
judged clinically  relevant by  the Investigator.
If such abnormalities already  pre-exist prior trial inclusion they  will be considered as 
baseline conditions.
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed 
up until they  have resolved, have been sufficiently  characterized, or no further information 
can be obtained.
Pregnancy
In the rare case that a female subject participating in this clinical trial becomes pregnant after 
having taken trial medication, the I nvestigator must report immediately  (within 24 hours) the 
drug exposure during pregnancy  (DEDP) to the Sponsor’s unique entry  point (country -
specific contact details will be provided in the I SF). The Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for 
Clinical Trials (Part A) should be used. 
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the Sponsor’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Clinical Trials (Part B). 
As preg nancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE, 
only the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be 
completed. If there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy then the SAE has to be repo rted 
on the SAE form in addition. 
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).

APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS 5.7
All measurements performed during this trial are acceptable measurements and commonly
used in monitoring safety aspects or assessing treatment response in patient s with CI AS.
The scheduled measurements are appropriate to see drug induced changes in phy sical
examination, vital signs, ECG and standard laboratory  values. These primary  and secondary
efficacy  endpoints and safety  endpoints are standard and accepted for evaluation of safet y
and tolerability  of an oral drug, and they are widely  used in this kind of studies. The period of 
12 weeks of treatment with BI 425809 is deemed appropriate to see a change in cognitive 
function in schizophrenic patients. 
Therefore, the appropriateness of all measurements applied in this trial is given.

VISIT SCHEDULE 6.1
All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart with time
window for rescheduling. Preferably the visits should be conducted in the morning. 
If any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date
schedule calculated from randomization visit . The trial medication packs contain sufficient 
medication to allow fo r these time windows.
The end of the trial is defined as “last patient out”, i.e. last visit completed by  the last patient.
If the reason for removal of a patient from the treatment is an adverse event or an abnormal
laboratory  test result, the patient mu st be followed until they  areresolved, or deemed 
reasonabl y followed up by theinvestigator on consultation with BI .When the total sample 
size for the main study  is reached, randomization in the imaging sub- study  will stop and this 
may result in the numb er of patients randomized in the sub- study  being less than 150 which is 
the planned sample size for the sub- study .
DETAILS OF TRIAL PRO CEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS 6.2
The following recommendations for the conduct of the neurops ychological assessments need
to be followed:
Each assessment of the Neurops ychological Rating Scales should preferentially b e 
done by  the same members of the site staff for a given patient throughout the study  
period. 
In addition, it is recommended that MCCB and SCoRS should not be administered to 
a patient b y the same rater at the same visit to prevent bias on the SCoRS rati ngs. 
The MCCB should always be performed at the same time of the day , within a window 
of +/ -60 minutes at Visit 1, 2, 4 and/or (e)EOT. Pr eferabl y, the assessment of the
MCCB is done in the morning. If the cognitive testing can’t be started at the same 
time within the allowed time frame (± 60 minutes) at a scheduled visit, the visit should 
be
rescheduled within the allowed visit window.
Study  procedures of Screening Visit (Visit 1) , 
Visit 2, Visit 4 and (e)EOT Visit can be 
split into 2 sequential day s. If the study  procedures are split into 2 sequential day s, the 
MCCB ,   
should be performed at the first day  of the two sequential day s 
(i.e., the day  prior to Da y 1), and the psychopathologic assessments should be 
performed on the second day .

judgement of the rater/investigator. 
The mem bers of the site staff that will be administering the Neurops ychological 
Rating Scales have to be properl y trained (either at the investigator training or 
individually ) and training documentation has to be filed in the I SF. The training 
standards and stand ards for the conduct of the assessments will be defined for each 
assessment individually  and can be found in the I SF. It is the responsibility  of the 
Principal I nvestigator at the site to ensure proper training of all members of the site 
staff involved in the neuropsy chological assessments.
Study  procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in the Flow Chart . Additional details
regarding visit procedures are provided below.
Patients do not have to come fasted for an y trial visit.
6.2.1 Screening and run -in period(s)
Screening Period
After patients have been informed about the trial, written informed consent in accordance 
with GCP and the local legislation must be obtained prior to any  study  related procedures 
taking place. Once consented, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the trial and to have 
started screening. The patient should be recorded on the enrolment log and be registered in 
the IRT s ystem as a screened patient .
One additional written informed consent for unspecified pharmacogenomics study  must be 
obtained if the patient is willing to provide the blood sample for DNA banking.
Screening (Visit 1) should take place from -28 days to -7 day sbefore Visit 2.
Demographics consist of gender, age , ethnicit y, smoking and alcohol history and will be
obtained after the main informed consent form is signed .
Baseline Conditions
BP should alway s be measured before an y blood samples are taken. For details regarding the 
correct method for measuring BP, see Section 5.3.2.
A 12 -lead ECG will be taken. The investigator will review the ECG recording and record an y 
ECG abnormality  of clinical significance under baseline conditions.

signs, 12 lead ECG and/or laboratory  assessment should be recorded as a baseline condition
All concomitant medications will be documented aft er the informed consent of main study  is 
signed.
Once Visit 1 procedures are complete and laboratory  results are received, inclusion/exclusion 
criteria must be reviewed again. If the patient is still eligible according to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, the patient should be contacted to schedule next visit.
If a patient does not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria the patient must be recorded in eCRFs 
as a screen failure. Patient must be registered as screen failure in IRT.
Patients who failed screening may repeat the screening phase once after discussion between 
investigator and sponsor . Rescreening will only  be allowed if the reasons for screening failure 
were reversible and have been resolved , based on investigator judgement . Permission to 
rescreen patients must be obtained from the TCM. The patient who will be rescreened needs 
to be re -consented. All the study  procedures of Screening Visit (Visit 1) must be repeated.
Medical History :
Psychiatric and relevant non- psychiatric history  will be obtained after the main informed 
consent form is signed.
Baseline disease state will be assessed b y PANSS. Positive scale item P1-P7will be used for 
confirming the eligibility  of study inclusion criterion # 3at Visit1 and Visit 2.
The MCCB , M.I.N.I and t he Baseline/screening scale of the eC-SSRS will be administered 
for eligibility  confirmation. 
Cognitive assessments of Screening Visit should be done at least 7 day s prior to cognitive 
baseline assessments performed at Visit 2. 
6.2.2 Treatment period(s)
The random ized treatment period is from Visit 2to Visit (e) EOT.
Patients should not take trial medication before coming to the clinic.
Throughout the treatment period, BP should always be measured before an y blood samples
aretaken. For details regarding the correct method for measuring BP, see Section 5.3.2
Randomization visit 2
As soon as eligibility  of a screened patient is confirmed, the patient may  enter the study  and
Visit 2 can be condu cted. This visit includes the assessment of the endpoints and
randomization via IRT. IRT should not be called before the patient has completed the
assessment of the neuropsy chological endpoints.

SAMPLE SIZE
STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL 7.1
Refer to Section 3.1 for details on the design of this trial.
The primar y objective sof this trial are the establ ishment of proof -of-concept with respect to a 
non-flat dose -response curve together with the definition of one or more suitable doses with 
respect to the efficacy  and safet y of orally  administered once dail y dosing of BI 425809 for 
further testing in pivotal phase III trials in patients with schizophrenia on stable antipsy chotic 
treatment. For this purpose the MCPMod approach is employ ed (R10-1424 ;R15-
1961).
The primary  endpoint is change from baseline in cognitive function as measured by  the 
composite MCCB score after 12 weeks of treatment. C hange from baseline in every day 
functional capacit y as measured b y SCoRS global ratings after 12 weeks of treatment is the 
secondary  endpoint .
NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES 7.2
The null hy pothesis is that there is a flat dose response pattern across placebo and an ydose of 
BI 425809 within the tested dose range of 0 to 25mg on the mean change in the composite 
MCCB score from baseline to Week 12. The alternative hy pothesis is that there is a non-flat 
dose response pattern indicating a benefit of BI 425809 compared to placebo .
The MCPMod procedure allows simultaneous evaluati on of different plausible dose response 
patterns whilst protecting the overall probability  of ty pe I error (one-sided alpha of 0.05)
. The 
pre-specified dose response patterns and the corresponding parameters are outlined in Section 
7.3.1 and Section 7.7.
PLANNED ANALYSES 7.3
The following patient analysis sets are defined for this trial:
Treated Set (TS): includes all patients who signed informed consent and were treated 
with at least one dose of the trial medication. Patients in TS are anal yzed under the 
actual trial medication received at randomization. The TS is used for safet y anal ysesas 
well as demographics and baseline characteristics.
Full A nalysis Set (FAS): includes all patients in treated set who had non -missing 
baseline and at least one non-missing post- baseline and on -treatment measurement on 
any efficacy  endpoint. Patients in FAS are anal yzed according to the intent- to-treat 
Boehringer Ingelheim                                                                                                      28Mar 2019

FAS is used for efficacy  anal yses.
Data from patients who were screened but not randomize d will be listed but not included in 
any summary  or inferential statistics. Specifications or important protocol violations will be 
provided in the TSAP. 
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
Primary  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint 7.3.1.1
The anal yses of Po CC and dose finding are carried out using the MCPMod approach (R10-
1424 )in combination with Mixed effects M odel R epeated Measures (MMRM) approach 
(R15-4293) whereb y several plausible dose response patterns/models are evaluated, while 
keeping full control of the overall ty pe I error rate of 5% 1-sided, to identify  the best- fitting 
model or subset of models. The MMRM model as specified in Section 7.3.1.2 will be fitted 
for the MCPMod.
For the Po CC testing and for the sample size calculat ion, the basic shape of each of the 
models to be tested must be pre -defined. Six different models are considered in the anal ysis: 
linear, linear in log, Emax, Sigmoid Emax, logistic and beta model. Except in the beta model, 
the maximum effect is assumed to be achieved at the maximum dose being tested. For the 
sample size calculation, the maximum standardized effect size is assumed to be 0.35. Further 
details are given in Section 7.7 .
The active BI 425809 doses are 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 25 mg once dail y. The following 
model assumptions and resulting graphs ( Figure 7.3 .1.1: 1 ) have been selected to cover both 
plausible and a diverse range of dose resp onse patterns:  
Linear: no assumptions needed
Linear in log: no assumptions needed
Emax: 20% of the maximum effect is achieved at 2 mg
Sigmoid Emax: 25% of the maximum effect is achieved at 5 mg
          75% of the maximum effect is achieved at 10 mg
Logistic: 10% of the maximum effect is achieved at 5 mg
        50% of the maximum effect is achieved at 10 mg
Beta model:           75% of the maximum effect is achieved at 2 mg
                              87.5% of the maximum effect is achie ved at 5 mg
                             25% of the maximum effect is achieved at 25 mg
                             Maximum effect achieved at 10 mg

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015PoCC is established if at least one model is statistically  significant, rejecting the null 
hypothesis of a flat dose response relation over 12 weeks for the primary  endpoint (mean 
change from baseline in composite MCCB score) jointly  for each of the candidate dose 
response models with a contrast test controlled for the family -wise type I error rate at one-
sided α = 0.05.
If PoC C is established, the best -fitting model (s)from the above set of six models can be 
refitted to the data without any  parameter assumptions to generate new estimates of the mode l 
parameters from the data. The final model will be obtained via weighted model averaging 
across the significant models based on the Akaike I nformation Criterion (AIC) (the smaller 
the AI C value the better the model fit) . The target dose(s) can then be det ermined from that 
model by  incorporating information on the minimum clinically  relevant effect as well as 
safet y information. The target dose should 
be chosen within the dose range investigated 
(0mg -25mg) though the actual modelling will be performed on a broader range of doses 
including extrapolation.

If considered relevant, the MCPMod approach will also be applied to the secondary  efficacy  
endpoint. I
n addition, exploratory  treatment comparisons will be conducted using an MMRM 
approach similar to the one specified for the primary  efficacy  endpoint . More details on the 
analysis of secondary  
efficacy  endpoint will be specified in the TSAP.
7.3.4 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities
(MedDRA) coding dictionary . Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All 
adverse events with an onset between the start of treatment and the endof the residual effect 
period (REP), a period of 11daysafter the last dose of trialmedication ,willbe assigned to 
the treatment period for evaluation.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis and will be summarized under the 
actual trial medication received at randomization . In general, safety  anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring between the start of treatment and 
the end of the residual effect period will be considered ‘treatment -emergent’.  The residual 
effect period is defined as 11 days after the last dose of trial medication . Adverse events that 
start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as 
‘treatment -emerg ent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the MedDRA.
Frequency  tables for all adverse events, protocol-
specified adverse event of special interest 
(AESI), serious adverse event (SAE), adverse event leading to death, adverse event leading to 
discontinuation, investigator assessed drug- related adverse event and serious adverse event 
will be generated for treatment- emergent a dverse events. In addition, summary  statistics and 
descriptive analy ses will be conducted for other safety  parameters including worsening of 
disease state as assessed by  PANSS and suicidality  as assessed by  C-SSRS.
Laboratory  data will be analy sedboth quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Tre atment groups will be compared descriptively  with regard to distribution 
parameters as well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abn
ormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other sa fety-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings befo re start of treatment.

No interim anal ysis is planned.
HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 7.5
Every  effort will be made to collect complete data at the specific time points. In general, for 
completely  missing visits missing data will not be imputed and will be handled through the 
MMRM using a restricted maximum likelihood method under the “missing at random” 
assumption. Details on the handling of missing data will be specified in the TSAP prior to 
unblinding.
RANDOMIZATION 7.6
Eligible p atients will be randomized with ratio of 1:1:1:1:2 to BI  425809 2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg 
25 mg and placebo . The randomization will be implemented in blocks to achieve balanced 
allocation to each treatment arm. In addition, randomization will be stratified for the main 
study  alone and for the main study  and the imaging substudy , i.e., patients who give consent 
to participate in the imaging substudy  besides the main study  
will be randomized with the 
same ratio of 1:1:1:1:2 to the five treatment arms as for those who consent to the main study  
but donot consent to participate in the imaging substudy .When the tota l sample size for the 
main study  is achieved, the randomization to the stratum of the imaging sub -study  will stop.
The randomization will be conducted via an interactive response technology  (IRT). BI will 
arrange for the randomization and the packaging and labelling of trialmedication. The 
randomization list will be generated using a validated system, which involves a pseudo -
random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non -
predictable. The block size will be docume nted in the CTR. Access to the codes will be 
controlled and documented.

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan2015DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE 7.7
For the purposes of calculating the sample size for this phase II trial, we consider a range of 
standardized effect sizes showing better efficacy  of BI 425809 as compared to placebo in the 
composite MCCB score change from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment, i.e., 0.3, 0.35, 0.4 
and 0.45,
and assume the six candidate dose response patterns as described in Section 7.3.1.1.
Since the randomization allocation ratio for thefour BI 425809 dose arms and placebo is 
1:1:1:1 :2, the sample size required for the placebo arm and the active treatment arms are 
display ed separatel y. Table 7. 7: 1below gives the sample size calculations under different 
effect sizes using 1-sided ty pe I error rate of 0.05 and 80% power. The sa mple size 
calculations areperformed using the MCPMod approach assuming the six plausible dose 
response patterns as described in Section 7.3.1.1 and implemented using the statistical 
software R package ‘DoseFinding’ (R15-2001 )version 0.9-12 
released on 28 SEP 2014
(depends on R version ≥ 2.15.0) . The R codes for the sample size calculations as well as the 
analyses using the MCPMod approach will be provided in the TSAP.

MCCB score change from baseline with 80% power and one -sided

      N for each active treatment arm 114 84 65 52
      Total 684 504 390 312
A sample size of 75 evaluable patients in each of the BI 425809 arm and 150 evaluable 
patients in the placebo arm is needed to establish Po CC of a standardized effect size of 0.35 
with an average power of 80% and one -sided alpha of 0.05. Assuming a 10% dropout rate
which is considered reasonable based on CIAS trials to date, 84 patients in each of the BI 
425809 arm and 168 patients in the placebo arm are required. Therefore a total sample size of 
504 evaluable patients with 84 patients in each of the BI 426809 arm and 168 patients in the 
placebo arm is chosen for this phase II tria l.
The sample size calc ulations in Table 7.7: 2 consider a range of effect size and power for a 
direct comparison between BI 425809 doses and the placebo. Two- sample t -test is used for 
these exploratory treatment comparisons without adjust ingfor multiplicity .

001-MCS -40-106- RD-03(12.0)/Saved on:30Jan201510.8.5 Ophthalmological examinations
The following ophthalmological assessments will be performed in this study, at time -points 
given in the Flow Chart . All assessments should be evaluated by  an ophthalmologist or 
certified ophthalmic technicians. The ophthalmologist will serve as a consultant to the 
investigator and report the results of the ophthalmological examinations supported b y 
worksheets provided from study  level. These worksheets will serve as source data and will be 
archived in the patients chart at the study  site. All test results in each visit will be documented 
in the above mentioned source documents and entered in the eCRF. An y abnormal findings 
will be documented, and if applicable, severit y grading 1 -4 (1 = very  mild, 2 = mild, 3 = 
moderate, 4 = severe) will be provided. 
Any deterioration observed during the ophthalmologic assessments should be reported to the 
investigator and based on the clinical judgment, can be documented as an AE. The 
investigator may  consult with the ophthalmologist on the grading of AEs at any  time.
In case of clinical abnormal findings an additional ophthalmologic examination may  be 
considered.
The description of the ophthalmological assessments below is meant to represent the current 
medical standard for these examinations. The ophthalmologist may  deviate from these 
descriptions if deemed medicall y appropriate if it is (per medical judgment) ensured that the 
same diagnostic standard is met and the same medical conclusion can be drawn. An y 
deviation and the potential diagnostic consequences should be documented and 
communicated to the study site.
Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)
BCVA will be determined using Ear ly Treatment Diabetic Retinal Scale (ETDRS) charts at a 
4-meter testing distance under standard, certified lighting condition (Precision Vision CAT 
N02425). ETDRS Chart 1(CAT 2111) will be used for the right eye, Chart 2 (CAT 2112) for 
the left ey e and Refraction Chart R (CAT 2110) for the refractive error. If the patient is 
unable to read at least the 20/100 line, the test will be repeated with the distance reduced to 
one meter. For those unable to read the ETDRS chart at an y distance, the following steps will 
be count fingers, hands movements and light/no light perception. The same optoty pe will be 
used for each patient throughout the stud
y. The refractive error using Refraction Chart R will 
be determined at the baseline visit and collected throughout the remainder of the study  period 
when BCVA is performed. Both ey es will be evaluated separatel y and the results captured in 
the eCRF, as well as the occurrence of an y deviations from ETDRS chart reading.
Farnsworth -Munsell 100 hue test (F -M 100)
Color vision testing using the Farnsworth -Munsell 100 (Munsell Color Services Lab, X- Rite, 
Inc.) hue test will be used to evaluate each patient’s category  of color vision or color vision 
deficiency  in both ey es, separately . It consists of 93 colors mounted in plastic caps, housed in 
four separate cases (Serial No. 555103180814, 08/2014). Each case consists of two hinged 
panels which contain a quarter of the 85 numbered, removable color caps. Two caps are 
repeated and fixed as pilot colors at either end of one panel in each case, making a total of 93 
caps. Each hue cap between the fixed anchors can be adjusted as the observer sees fit. The

differences in color hue.
The standard s oftware included in the FM 100 package will be used for scoring and anal yzing 
the results. Total error score (TES) will be used as a measurement of color vision. Total error 
score and level of color vision deficiency  classification (e.g. superior, average, low 
discrimination) will be recorded on the eCRF. Examination of color vision will be performed 
at during screening), Day 64±10 (peak exposure), and at End of Trial + 7.
Pupil Diameter Measurement
Both left and right pupil measurements will be taken sepa rately using a pupil gauge under 
standardized lighting conditions. Measurements for each ey e will be recorded in the eCRF.
Anterior and posterior biomicroscopy
The anterior and posterior chamber slit lamp examination will be done in conjunction with a 
biomicroscope (for example Haag Streit BC900). The examination of the anterior segment 
and posterior segments will include the ey elid, sclera, conjunctiva, cornea, iris, lens, and the 
anterior vitreous. The binocular slit -lamp examination (stereoscopic magnified view of the 
ocular structures) will be also performed for further documentation of the ocular findings. 
The anterior and posterior chamber slit lamp examinat ion will be performed in both ey es. 
Examination results of normal or abnormal will be indicated, and if abnormal to provide the 
condition and severit y grading from 1 -4 scale. Photographs will be taken if a clinically  
significant abnormality is noted per ophthalmologist discretion. Results will be recorded in 
the eCRF. 
Intra-Ocular Pressure Measurement (IOP)
Intra -ocular pressure of both ey es will be measured separately (using the Goldmann 
applanation tonometry  (Haag Streit AT900) or a similar device). 
Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD- OCT)
High definition optical coherence tomography (spectral domain OCT) will be performed to 
evaluate the retinal and sub- retinal structures of both ey es. The central retinal thickness, 
along with other anato mical findings such as presence or not of intra -retinal fluid, sub -retinal 
fluid, and choroid and retinal pigmented epithelial lay er changes will be documented and 
recorded in the eCRF. OCT images of both ey es will be captured and reported as normal or 
abnormal, and the central retinal thickness measurements will be recorded.
Further explanations and description of abnormalities will be provided for all abnormal 
results. 
A central service vendor will be used to harmonize the OCT procedure and to centrall y assess 
the results.
Indirect fundoscopy
Dilated indirect fundoscopy  of the retina will be performed in previously  dilated ey es (topical 
mydriatic ey edrops) with a proper lens and either a slit lamp microscope or a light attached to 
a headband. Indirect fu ndoscopy  of the retina will be performed at Day  -1 (Baseline), at Visit 
5 (Day  64)  and at End of Trial. Results of normal or abnormal exams will be recorded on the 
eCRF, with further explanation and severit y gradings (Grade 1- 4) for abnormal results.

Planned Anal yses 10.8.7.1
No statistical testing will be performed. All safety  anal yses will be assessed in a descriptive 
way based on change from baseline for the following measurements at Week 9 (Visit 5) and 
Week 12 (Visit 6 –EoT visit):
Number of letters correct based on the best corrected visual acuit y test (BCVA)
Total error score from the Farnsworth -Munsel 100 hue testing (F -M 100)
Pupil diameter measurement
Categorical changes (normal/abnormal) from the anterior and posterior b iomicroscopy  
exam
Intra -ocular pressure (IOP)
Central retinal thickness as measured b y High definition ocular coherence 
tomograph y (SD OCT)
Categorical changes (normal/abnormal) from indirect fundoscop y of the retina.
Sample Size 10.8.7.2
It is planned to include a total of at least 60 subjects in this sub -study . The planned sample 
size is not based on a power calculation. The size of 10 subjects per dose group (with 20 
patients in the placebo group) is in general considered as sufficient f or the exploratory

Section to be changed 5.3.5.2  Assessment of suicidality
Description of change Addition of investigator rated C-SSRS assessment 
to allow psy chiatrists to repeat or validate the 
telephone assessment in case doubtful reports from 
the telephone assessment are obtained. 
Rationale for change The protocol asks for ps ychiatrists review of the 
report and requests that doubtful report should be 
repeated or reports be validated. However there is 
currentl y no s ystematic process to allow 
psychiatrists to repeat or validate the telephone 
assessment in case of doubt. Therefor ewe will 
provide sites with access to the investigator rated 
C-SSRS and provide corresponding training for 
this assessment, so psy chiatrist can repeat doubtful 
reports.

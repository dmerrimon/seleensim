Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS)  
Study Des cription : Opioid analgesics are prescribed for moderate to severe pain disorders, 
however there are contraindications and side effects that are common to 
all opioids. We hypothesize using local regional anesthetic during  sinus 
surgery will reduce pain , therefore dec reasing the need for post -operative

oral opioid usage.  
Objectives:  
 Primary Objective:   The primary of objective is to determine if a long -acting 
regional anesthetic applied after a surgery will reduce post -operative oral 
opioid usage.  
 Secondary Objective:  The secondary objective is to  measure the level of 
each patient’s pain.  
Endpoint s: • Primary Endpoint:  The amount of post -operative pain  after FESS.   
Participants will self -report a pain score on a scale of 0 -10, with 0 
being “no pain” and 10 being “worst pain imaginable” on the 
provided questionnaire (see Appendix 1).    
 • Secondary Endpoint:  Patient’s daily pain medication usage.  
The amount of opioid medication used post -procedure will be 
determined by a pill count at the first post -operative clinic visit.  
Study Population:  It is anticipated that 3 0 subjects will be enrolled in this protocol. Potential 
subjects will be male or female adults over  the age of 18 from the United 
States who undergo  functional endoscopic sinus surgery under the

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
Opioid analgesics are still being prescribed to help control moderate to severe pain, however these 
medications  are not without risks. Patient s are at an increased risk of dependence which is a growing 
national concern. We plan to conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the use of regional an esthesia after 
routine sinus surgery to help decrease the need for post -operative opioid use.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Opioid analgesics are prescribed for moderate to severe acute pain; however, there are 
contraindications, cautions, and side effects that are common with all opioids. Dependence and 
tolerance are also likely with regular opioid use, resulting in the current nationwide opioid epidemic. In 
Reducing Opioid Use Following FESS  Version 1.0

 Alabama alone, there were 343 opioid -related overdose deaths in 2016, 124 of which were related to 
prescription opio ids. Alabama providers have the highest prescribing rate in the country, nearly twice 
the national rate, per the NIH/NIDA website ( https://www.dr ugabuse.gov/drugs -abuse/opioids/opioid -
summaries -by-state/alabama -opioid -summary ). In 2015, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released 
prescribing guidelines relating to chronic pain, and in 2018 Alabama’s Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance 
group limited  the supply of opioids allowed to their members to 7 days 
(https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2018/03/bluecross_blueshield_changing.html ).  
 
There is currently no clinical guideline for prescribing post -operative opioid medications for functional 
endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). A 2018 survey documenting prescribing patterns by 168 members of 
the American Rhinologic Society found that most physicians wh o participated prescribed, on average, 27 
opioid pain pills for patients after surgery. Prior studies have been performed to help decrease the pain 
patient’s feel after sinus surgery.  Haytoglu (2016) revealed that adding non absorbable sinus packs 
loaded with local anesthetics such as bupivacaine achieved less pain values and improved patient 
satisfaction scores.   
 
Given this current data we believe injecting patients with a long acting analgesic during the procedure 
will help reduce post -operative pain. If we can decrease the amount of pain patients have in the post -
operative period we can theoretically decrease the number of opioid pain pills prescribed. We plan to 
also track the number of opioid pills consumed by patients in the post -operative period to  obtain a 
somewhat uniform prescribing pattern within surgeons.   
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
All of the drugs to be used in this study are FDA -approved, commonly -used, widely available, generic 
medications. These drugs will be prescr ibed at their standard dosing for their approved indications.  
 
As outlined in the package inserts for the medications under study in this protocol, the following adverse 
reactions have been identified during post approval use. Because these reactions are r eported 
voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their 
frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.  
 
• Risks associated with bupivacaine hydrochloride (MarcaineTM): The most frequently reported 
adverse reactions are restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, tremors , nausea, 
vomiting, chills, and constriction of pupils (central nervous system reactions ) and depression of 
the myocardium, decreased car diac output, heartblock, hypotension, bradycardia, ventricular 
arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and cardiac arrest 
(cardiovascular system reactions). Other reported reactions include persistent anesthesia, 
parest hesia, weakness, or paralysis . Allergic reactions are characterized by signs such as 
urticaria, pruritus, erythema, angioneurotic edema (including laryngeal edema), tachycardia, 
sneezing, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, syncope, excessive sweating, elevated t emperature, and 
possibly, anaphylactoid -like symptomatology (including severe hypotension) . Reactions to 
MARCAINE are characteristic of those associated with other amide -type local anesthetics. A 
major cause of adverse reactions to this group of drugs is e xcessive plasma levels, which may be 
due to overdosage, unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation. In 
Reducing Opioid Use Following FESS  Version 1.0

 addition to systemic dose -related toxicity, unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug during 
the intended performance of cau dal or lumbar epidural block or nerve blocks near the vertebral 
column (especially in the head and neck region) may result in underventilation or apnea (“Total 
or High Spinal”). Also, hypotension due to loss of sympathetic tone and respiratory paralysis or  
underventilation due to cephalad extension of the motor level of anesthesia may occur. This 
may lead to secondary cardiac arrest if untreated. Patients over 65 years, particularly those with 
hypertension, may be at increased risk for experiencing the hypo tensive effects of bupivacaine 
hydrochloride. Factors influencing plasma protein binding, such as acidosis, systemic diseases 
which alter protein production, or competition of other drugs for protein binding sites, may 
diminish individual tolerance.  Bupiv acaine hydrochloride carries a black box warning for cardiac 
arrest with difficult resuscitation or death during use for epidural anesthesia in obstetrical 
patients.  
• Risks associated with dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection:  The most frequently reported 
adverse reactions are a naphylaxis, infection, seizures, hypertension, erythema, rash, urticarial, 
nausea, vomiting, edema, petechial, ecchymosis, skin pigmentation abnormality, acne, 
headache, dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, anxiety, and depression.  
• Risks associated with protocol -mandated procedures:  
o Surgical procedures:  All surgical procedures will be performed in the routine manner. 
There will be no additional clinical or surgical risks, other than the normal risks for 
patients undergoin g this type of treatment.  
o Questionnaires: Completion of a questionnaire and the questions might make the 
subject feel uncomfortable or upset. Subjects will have the choice to not answer any 
such questions.   
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
An article published in 2015 by Knezevic evaluated 14 studies in which physicians added  
dexamethasone into the local anesthetic used for brachial plexus block. They concluded patients 
injected with local anesthetic plus dexamethasone had improved post -operative pain when compared to 
a control group. Our goal is to apply this to sinus surgery in providing analgesia to the sensory nerves of 
the face/sinus.  The immediate potential benefit for the patient is reduced discomfort and pain in the 
post -operative p eriod. Potential long term benefits would include decrease need for post -operative 
opioid consumption therefore potentially decreasing the possible addictive habit of using opioids.   
 
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
Routinely dexamethasone is u sed for general anesthesia to help decrease inflammation and post -
operative swelling.  All patients will be screened for any previous reactions to the medications being 
used in our study. Patient medical records will also be reviewed for past drug allergie s.  As our stud y 
plans to evaluate the local effects of bupivacaine with dexamethasone , we anticipate only mild local 
reactions , as we will not systemically inject the drugs being used  The risks to participants will likely 
encounter only local skin reactio ns to the medications. The information gained will help to possibly 
standardize how we treat post -operative pain after sinus surgery.

 3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR 
ENDPOINT S 
Primary  Primary  Primary  
The primary objective is to 
determine if a long -acting regional 
anesthetic applied after a surgery 
will reduce post -operative oral 
opioid usage.  
 
 The amount of post -operative pain 
after FESS.  Participants will self - 
report a pain score on a scale of 0 -10, 
with 0 being “no pain” and 10 being 
“worst pain imaginable.”   
 
   
 The use of narcotics 
post -operatively is to 
control pain; if we can 
reduce post -operative 
pain, essentially we can 
decrease post -
operative opioid use.  
Secondary  Secondary  Secondary  
The secondary objective is to 
measure  the level of each patient’s 
pain.  
 Patients’ daily pain medication usage. 
The amount of opioid medication 
used post -procedure will be 
determined by a pill count at the first 
post -operative clinic visit.  
 Pain is a subjectively 
based outcome that 
can be difficult to 
determine prior to a 
surgery. We believe if 
we are able to reduce 
pain in the majority of 
our patients tested 
then, we can apply this 
on a global  scale to 
create a uniform 
number of opioid pain 
medications prescribed 
after surgery.  
 
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
Opioid analgesics are prescribed for moderate to severe pain disorders ; however , there are 
contraindications and side effects that are common to all opioids. We hypothesize using local regional 
anesthetic after sinus surgery will reduce pain , therefore decreasing the need for post -operative opioid 
consumption.  
 
This is a Phase 4, rand omized, single -blinded, single -site, parallel -assignment intervention with a primary 
purpose of supportive care after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). It is anticipated that 30 
subjects will be enrolled in this protocol. Potential subjects will be male or female adults over the age of 
18 from the United States who undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) under the 
supervision of one surgeon.

 Potential participants will be approached during their regularly -scheduled clinic visit about p articipation 
in the study. If they agree to participate, they will sign an informed consent form. During the baseline 
visit, demographic information, medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, height, and weight  
will be collected . A routine nas al endoscopy will be performed to assess the need for surgical 
intervention, and routine CT sinus scans will be obtained and/or reviewed.  
 
Participants will be randomized to one of the two following groups:  
• Treatment Group (n = 15): participants will recei ve 20 mL of 1.3% bupivacaine with 2 mg 
dexamethasone injected locally in the location for sensory nerves of the sinus cavities and face 
during the FESS procedure  
• Control Group (n = 15):  participants will not receive regional anesthetic during the FESS 
proc edure  
 
Participants will have their scheduled functional endoscopic sinus surgery procedure. After surgery, 
participants will be given a pain diary to record their pain score on a scale of 1 -10, and a place to record 
their use of opioids, as well as over -the-counter non -steroid anti -inflammatories such as acetaminophen 
and ibuprofen. Participants will record their scores and drug use daily for 10 days post -surgery. At their 
first post -operative clinic visit, the diary will be reviewed, and their opioid use will also be evaluated by 
counting the pills left on their prescription.  
 
Data points/variables to be collected during the study could include the following, to be ascertained 
from the medical record and/or patient report:  
• Name  
• Medical Record Number  
• Age 
• Gender  
• Type of surgery  
• Duration of surgery  
• Medications given by anesthesia intra - and post -operatively  
• Post -operative pain medication used prior to and after discharge  
• Post -operative complications  
• Post -discharge/post -operative pain evaluation by patient diary  
 
Participant duration will be up to 21 days, dependent on standard -of-care scheduling of the first post -
operative clinic visit. It is a nticipated that the study will be open to enrollment for 12 months.  
 
Primary Objective:   The primary of objective is to determine if a long -acting local regional anesthetic 
applied after a surgery will reduce post -operative oral opioid usage.  
• Primary Endp oint: The amount of post -operative pain after FESS, as determined by patient self -
report of pain on a scale of 0 -10. 
 
Secondary Objective:  The secondary objective is to  measure the level of each patient’s pain.  
• Secondary Endpoint : Patient’s daily pain medication usage .

 4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
The rationale for our study deals with anesthetizing the sensory nerves of the face. The nerve 
distribution of the face deals with the trigeminal nerve. We plan to inject a lo ng acting local analgesic at 
the infraorbital, infatrochlear, external nasal, supraorbital, supratrochlear nerves of the face after 
functional endoscopic sinus surgery. The control arm will be randomly chosen for which patient will not 
be injected. A poten tial problem with the control group is that patients in the PACU will have intact 
facial sensation. This could alert them to the fact that they were not injected with a local analgesic and 
thus reinforce the need for post -operative narcotic usage.  
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE 
The nasal cavity is innervated by sensory nerves via the trigeminal nerve. We believe using a 
standardized dose of bupivacaine 1.3% combined with 2mg preservative -free dexamethasone to areas 
on around the nasal cavity that are innervated with sensory nerves will improve post -operative pain 
control results. A max amount of 20 mL will be injected into each study participant. The control group 
will receive no injection.  
 
4.4 END OF STUDY DEFINITION

7 STUDY INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  AND PARTICIPANT  
DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
Discontinuation from  study intervention  will mean discontinuation from the study , and those subjects 
will be considered screen failures and will be removed from the dataset. No further data will be 
collected from those who are determined to be screen failures.  
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY  
Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant  
• Disease progression which requires discontinuation of  the study intervention  
• If the participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
• Non -compliance with follow -up activities  
Subjects who sign the informed consent form an d are randomized but do not receive the study 
intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and 
receive the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued  from the 
study, will be replaced.  
7.3 LOST TO FOLLOW -UP 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for the post -operative  
scheduled visit  within 21 days  and is unable to be contacted by the study site  staff .  
 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:

P a g e  | 10 
 • The site will attempt to contact the participant and ascertain if the participant wishe s to and/or 
should continue in the study . 
• The investigator or his clinic staff  will make every effort to regain contact with the participant 
(where possible, 3 telephone calls /portal messages/emails , and if necessary, a certified letter to 
the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact 
attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she wi ll be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up.

8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
8.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse event (of note, the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if  it were more severe)  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important me dical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
8.2.3.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severi ty.  
 
• Mild  – Event s require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.   Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily  equate to “serious”.  
 
Reducing Opioid Use Following FESS  Version 1.0 
 27 November 2018  
  
P a g e  | 12 
 8.2.3.2  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention  assessed  by the clinician who 
examines and evaluates the participant  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be  suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibil ity that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset , or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
8.2.3.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator  will be respo nsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
8.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an  adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the 
training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as a n AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each episode.  
 
The S tudy Coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.2.5  ADVERSE AND SERIOUS EVENT REPORTING  
Reducing Opioid Use Following FESS  Version 1.0 
 27 November 2018  
  
P a g e  | 13 
 All serious adverse events must be reported to the IRB according to regulatory requirements. The 
Principal Investigator will immediately report to the sponsor any serious adverse event, whether or not 
considered study intervention related, including those listed in the protocol or package insert and must 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator deems the event to be chronic or the subject is stable. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
8.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participant s or others to include, in general, any incident, experienc e, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
proc edures involved in the research); and  
• Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTIN G  
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corre ctive actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours  of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event.  
Reducing Opioid Use Following FESS  Version 1.0 
 27 November 2018  
  
P a g e  | 14 
 • Any other UP will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate ins titutional officials (as required by an institution’s 
written reporting procedures)  and the Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) within the 
timeline in accordance with the policy  of the IRB’s receipt of the report of th e problem from the 
investigat or. 
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
The following subsections  should describe the statistical tests and analysis plans for the protocol. They 
should indicate  how the study will answer the most important questions with precision and a minimum 
of bias, while remaining feasible.  Many elements below can be found in ICH Guidance for Industry E9 
Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials and the CONSORT statement  which describes standards for 
improving the quality of reporting rando mized controlled trials.  
 
State whether there will be a formal  Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP).  The SAP generally includes additional 
statistical analysis detail (e.g., more detail of analysis populations, summary of statistical strategies). If a 
separate SAP will be developed, su bsections below can be summarized.  
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
State the formal and testable null and alternative hypotheses for primary and key secondary endpoints, 
specifying the type of comparison (e.g., superiority, equivalence or non -inferiority, dose re sponse) and 
time period for which each endpoint will be analyzed.

9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
Include number of participants to recruit, screen, and enroll to  have adequate power to test the key 
hypothes es for the study.  P rovide all information needed to validate your calculations and judge the 
feasibility of enrolling and following the necessary number of participant s. In particular, specify all of the 
following: 
 
• Outcome measure used for calculations (almost always the primary variable) 
• Test statistic  
• Null and alternative  hypotheses 
• Type I error rate (alpha)  
• Power level (e.g., 80% power)

P a g e  | 15 
 • Statistic al method used to calculate the sample size, with a reference for it and for an y software 
utilized  
• Anticipated impact of d ropout rates, withdrawal, cross-over to other study arms, missing data, 
etc. on study power (see also 9.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s) and 9.4.3 
Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s) ) 
• Method for adjusting calculations for planned interim analyses, if any (Section 9.4.6, Planned 
Interim Analys es). 
 
Further, present calcu lations  from a suitable  range of assu mptions  to gauge the robust ness of the 
proposed sample s ize. 
 
Discuss whether the sample size provides suffici ent power for add ressing seco ndary endpoints or 
exploratory analyses (e.g., subgroup analyses or moderator analyses involving an interaction term,  
Section 9.4.9, Exploratory Analyses ).

9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
Clearly identify and describe the analysis datasets (e.g., which participant s will be included in each). As a 
guide, this may include, but is not limited to, any or all of the following:  
 
• Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Dataset (i.e., all randomized participant s) 
• Modified Intention -to-Treat Analysis Dataset (e.g., participant s who took at least one dose of 
study intervention  and/or have some particular amount of follow -up outcome data)  
• Safety Analysis Dataset: defines the subset of participant s for whom safety analyses will be 
conducted (e.g., participant s who took at least one dose of study intervention ) 
• Per-Protocol Analysis Dataset: defines a subset of the participant s in the full analy sis (ITT) set 
who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data would be likely to 
represent  the effects of study intervention  according to the underlying scientific model (e.g., 
participant s who took at least 80% of study intervention  for 80% of the days within the 
maintenance period)  
• Other Datasets  that may be used for sensitivity analyses

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICA L, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
10.1.1.1  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting any study 
procedures . A separate screening consent form will not be used.   
 
10.1.1.2  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the indiv idual’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-approved and the participant  will be asked to read and review the document. The 
investigator will explain the research study to the participant  and answer any questions that may arise. 
A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the  participant’s comprehension of the 
purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions 
prior to signing.  The participant s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or 
surrogates or t hink about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant  will sign the informed 
consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  Participant s must be 
informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice.  A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participant s for their records. 
The informed consent process will be conducted and  documented in the source document (including the 
date), and the form signed, before the participan t undergoes any study -specific procedures.  The rights 
and welfare of the participant s will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their 
medi cal care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study . 
10.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, docume nting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by the suspending or terminating party to regulatory authorities.  If the study is prematurely 
terminated or suspended, the  Principal Investigator ( PI) will promptly inform study partic ipants  and the 
Instituti onal Review Board ( IRB), and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study 
participants will be contacted, as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
  
Circumstances that may warrant te rmination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
Reducing Opioid Use Following FESS  Version 1.0 
 27 November 2018  
  
P a g e  | 20 
 • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futility  
 
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed , 
and satisfy the IRB . 
 
10.1.3  CONFIDENTIALITY  AND PRIVACY   
Participant  confidentiality  and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators  and their 
staff. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition 
to the clinical information relating to partici pants. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, 
and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the 
study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approva l of the 
sponsor.  
 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
 
Representative s of the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) or other  regulatory agencies  may inspect all 
documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, 
medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) for the participant s in this study. The clinical study site will 
permit access to such records . 
 
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use

Title of Research: The Role of Regional Anesthesia  to Reduce Opioid Requirements Following  
Functional Endoscopic Sinus  Surgery (FESS): A Pilot  Study
UAB IRB Protocol #: IRB-300000567
Principal Investigator: Bradford Woodworth, M.D.
Sponsor: UAB Department  of Otolaryngology
General Information You are  being asked to take  part  in a research study.  This  research study is 
voluntary, meaning  you do not have to take part  in it.  The procedures, risks, and 
benefits are fully described further in the consent  form.
Purpose The purpose of  the study is  to determine  if receiving extra  pain medication during 
your sinus procedure affects the amount  and kind of pain medication that is taken 
after surgery.
Duration & Visits You will be in this study for  up to 21 days.
Overview of Procedures If you decide to  take  part in this  study, you will assigned by chance to  one  of the 
treatment groups. This  is called randomization. 
If you are picked for  the Treatment Group , you  will receive 10-12 mL of 
0.5% bupivacaine with  1:200,000 epinephrine and 2 mg  dexamethasone  
injected locally in  the location for sensory nerves  of the sinus cavities and 
face intraoperatively, or during the  FESS procedure.
If you are picked for  the Control Group , you  will not receive any local 
anesthetic during the FESS  procedure.
Both groups will receive the same post-operative prescription pain medication 
(Norco), will complete  a daily pain diary (recording  pain score  and medications  
taken), and will have a  prescription pain medication pill  count at the  first post-
operative clinic visit.
Risks You will be assigned to a  group by  chance,  which may  prove to  be less  effective  or 
to have  more side effects than  the other study group or alternatives. 
The most  common side effects of the medications include  nausea/vomiting, 
restlessness, anxiety,  dizziness, rash, and headache.
Benefits You may  not benefit directly  from taking  part  in this study. However, this study  
may help us better  understand how  to treat post-surgical pain  in the future.
Alternatives You do not have to participate in this study  to receive  standard  of care treatment  
for your sinus disorder. Your doctor  will tell you  more  about other treatments that 
may be available to you. You may choose to have no treatment at all.  One 
alternative may be to not to participate in this study.
Purpose of the Research  Study
We are  asking you to take part in a research study because you are  scheduled to have  a functional  endoscopic 
sinus surgery (FESS) procedure  for your sinus issue. You  will be  given a prescription for opioid  pain  medication

Page 2  of 7
Version Date: 4/11/19as part of your routine care after your surgery. The  purpose of this pilot research study is to  assess whether 
injecting a  local anesthetic during FESS is  feasible  and whether it  may affect the amount and kind  of pain 
medication that you will use after surgery.
There will be 30 participants enrolled at  UAB.
Study Participation & Procedures
If you agree to join the  study, your medical record will be reviewed  to obtain  information regarding your 
medical condition and  diagnosis, as well as demographic information, such as your  age and gender. During 
your pre-surgery  clinic visit, you will have a routine  nasal  endoscopy,  and your sinus CT scans  will be obtained 
and/or reviewed. 
You will be randomly picked (like the flip of a coin) to either receive the study intervention, or  to receive the 
standard of  care  treatment  during your surgery:
If you are picked for  the Treatment Group , you  will receive 10-12 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with 
1:200,000 epinephrine and 2 mg dexamethasone injected locally in the location for sensory nerves of  
the sinus cavities and  face intraoperatively,  during the FESS procedure.
If you are picked for  the Control Group , you  will not receive any local anesthetic during the FESS 
procedure.
You will then have your  surgery. This  surgery  will be performed in the routine manner  that  was planned for  
you, based on your  condition.   If you are picked for the Treatment Group, you will receive the  extra 
medication during  the procedure. If  you are picked  for the Control Group, you will not  receive any extra 
medication during  the procedure.
After your surgery, you will  be prescribed pain medication in  the routine manner. These are the  same 
medications that  you would have whether you were  participating in this study or  not.
For study purposes, you will  be given a study diary  to complete for  the first ten  days  following your surgery. 
This will consist of  a pain  scale, graded on a scale of 1-10, as  well as a  medication diary. You will be  asked to 
record all of the medications you take for the pain you experience  after  your  surgery, both the prescribed  
opioid as well as over-the-counter medications such as  Tylenol  or Advil. 
At your first post-operative clinic visit,  you  will bring in your study  diary and your  medicine bottles so  that we 
can count the number of  pills you have  left on your prescription.  We will  record these amounts for  our 
research data  only. 
The daily  study diary  will take approximately  5 minutes  per day to complete. The total amount  of time you will 
be in the study is up to 21 days, depending on when your first post-operative clinic visit is scheduled.
Risks and Discomforts
All of the drugs to be used in  this study  are FDA-approved, commonly-used, widely available, generic 
medications. These drugs will be used at  their  standard dosing for  their  approved indications.
If you are picked for  the Treatment Group , you  will receive extra pain medication during the  FESS procedure.
The most  common side effects of bupivacaine with  epinephrine (MarcaineTM) are:
restlessness
Page 3  of 7
Version Date: 4/11/19anxiety
dizziness
tinnitus
blurred vision
tremors
nausea/vomiting
chills
central nervous system reactions, such as constriction of  the pupils
heart block
hypotension (low blood pressure)
bradycardia (slow  pulse)
irregular heart  beat
rapid, life-threatening heart rhythms
The most  common side effects of dexamethasone  are:
allergic reaction
seizure
hypertension  (high blood pressure)
skin irritation or rash
nausea/vomiting
edema  (fluid collection under the skin)
bruising
acne
headache
dizziness
insomnia
anxiety
depression  
Save for the above-mentioned  risks  of side  effects, there is no  additional risk to  taking  bupivacaine with 
epinephrine and dexamethasone as part of this study.  There aren’t  any known increased risks  for taking these 
medications in combination. They do not have cross reactions with  each other or other known interactions  
that may lead to increased  risks,  other than those  listed above.
No matter what group you are assigned to, you will receive a prescription for hydrocodone-acetaminophen 
(commonly known as Norco) for any  post-operative  surgical pain you may have. There  is a chance that  those  
assigned to Control  Group (who will not receive any  local anesthetic during the  FESS  procedure)  will have an 
increase use of this post-operative pain medication. Risks  associated with opioid  use include:
respiratory depression
nausea/vomiting
allergic reaction
constipation
dizziness
headache
weakness
dry mouth

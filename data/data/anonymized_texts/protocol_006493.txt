Health Care Hotspotting: A Ra ndomized Controlled Trial 
Analysis Plan 
Date:  March 7, 2014 
Abstract 
This randomized trial investigates the impact of  the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers’ 
Care Management Program: Link2Care.  The program targets “super-utilizers”  of the health care 
system - specifically adults with 2 or more hospitalizations in the last six months and 2 or more 
chronic conditions - with intensive care-management services in the one to three months 
following hospital discharge.  A team of nurses, social workers, community health workers and 
health coaches, supported by real-time data of healthcare utilization, perform home visits, accompany patients to doctor visits, and help pati ents enroll in social-service programs.  This 
approach aims to improve the self-sufficiency of  patients in navigating the healthcare and social-
service systems and has the potential to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient health.  
Through random assignment to the intervention, we  plan to study the impact of the Link2Care 
program, particularly on subsequent hospital use.

1.   Introduction 
This document details our analysis plan for:  Health Care Hotspotting: A Randomized Controlled 
Trial.  This will serve as a record of the planned analyses to avoid concerns over searching for 
results ex post .  We anticipate that further analyses will be conducted as more outcome data 
become available, which we describe below, as well as research that is inspired by the initial 
findings.  In addition, as the plan has been prepared in advance of the pilot, it is possible that our 
planned analyses may be modified base d on what we learn during the pilot. 
The structure of the plan is as follows:  Section 2 briefly describes the intervention; Section 3 
reviews the related literature and highlights the innovations of this intervention; Section 4 
provides details on the trial itsel f; Section 5 describes the data and the primary outcome of 
interest; Section 6 presents the main empirical models, including Tables and Figures that we will 
complete as part of the study; Section 7 reports  preliminary analyses in  support of the plan; 
Section 8 briefly outlines our planned next step s in terms of additional data gathering and 
analyses; and   Section 9 concludes w ith caveats and interpretation issues. 
 
2.  The intervention 
The Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers’ Care Management Program, Link2Care, targets 
“super-utilizers” of the health car e system.  These are individuals with medically and socially 
complex needs who have frequent hospital ad missions.  Specifically, the Link2Care program 
targets patients in Camden, New Jersey hospitals  who have had at least two hospital admissions 
in the prior six months and have  at least two ch ronic conditions. 
Such heavy utilizers of hospital care account for a disproportionate share of healthcare spending.  
For example, CCHP analyzed hospital admission and emergency department use at three 
Camden hospital systems from 2002-2007 and found that 20% of patients accounted for 90% of 
the costs (Green et al., 2010).  When we compare patients admitted to Camden hospitals, in the year prior to an admission a typical patient targeted by the program has 2.5 times more 
admissions in the prior six months compared to ot her patients due to the targeting.  Such patients 
are also much more likely to be readmitted to the hospital over the year following the hospital 
stay, accruing $73,000 in hospital charges over that  time compared to an average of $6600 for 
patients not targeted by the program. 
In an effort to improve the health of these patients and reduce subse quent healthcare costs, 
Link2Care provides intensive care management and coordination for up to 6 months following 
hospital discharge.  Participants are assigned to  a multidisciplinary care team comprised of a 
registered nurse, a licensed practical nurse, a social worker, an intervention specialist, a 
community health worker, and health coaches.  They  then plan a series of home visits, schedule 
and accompany patients to initial primary care a nd specialty care visits, and support individuals 
3 
as they navigate various social service agencies  to enroll in public programs including Medicaid, 
SNAP/TANF, substance abuse and behavioral health programs, and programs that promote 
housing stability. 
More specifically, upon discharge from the hospital, the care team works to visit the patient at 
home within 3 days.  At the initial home visit, the care team (1) performs medication 
reconciliation—an inventory of th e medications prescribed to ga uge appropriateness and patient 
understanding, (2) conducts an assessment of the patient’s perception of the discharge experience and care coordination, medical/hea lth needs, activity/mobility, service needs, and stage of 
readiness to change, and (3) collaboratively sets  goals with the individual, such as compliance 
with the discharge plan.   
The care team then works closely with the patient to achieve these goals.  They aid in scheduling 
a primary care visit within 7 days of discharge and appropriate sp ecialist visits, as necessary.  A 
member of the team will accompany the patient to those visits to ensure that such appointments are kept and that the patient understands any inst ructions.  The team also helps the participant 
complete applications for social services and coaches the patient in self-care.  Subsequent home 
visits evaluate the patient’s and the team’s progress.  The end of the intervention is determined 
based on hospital utilization, indi vidual factors (health educa tion/literacy, disease self-
management, skills development, level of engagement, self-efficacy) and some systemic factors (access to, and the quality of, care, social support, etc.).  The person receives a graduation 
certificate and is then expected to meet healthcare needs in th e future through a primary care 
physician.  From October 2012 to January 2014, the median length of the intervention for those who completed it was 85 days. 
The approach aims to improve the self-sufficiency  of patients in navigati ng the healthcare and 
social-service systems.  It has the potential to reduce healthcare costs a nd improve patient health, 
as patients learn to use primary care to prevent an escalation of sy mptoms that leads to 
rehospitalization.  In an earlie r, non-randomized evaluation, this program has been found to 
improve health outcomes, decrease utilization of  emergency and inpatient services, and decrease 
costs for a cohort of 36 “high utilizers” fr om $1.2 million monthly to $534,000 monthly, a 
savings of 56% over five years (Green et al. , 2010). 
Due to staffing and financial constraints, Link2Care is currently ad ministered for only a subset of 
the patients who meet the eligib ility criteria, and the patients who are currently approached are 
chosen in an ad-hoc manner. This study would establish a formal process for determining – via 
random assignment – which subset of eligible in dividuals are offered the intervention.  This 
random assignment, which will not reduce the nu mber of individuals who benefit from the 
services, will allow us to isolate the causal effects of the CCH P Link2Care Program.   
These findings will not only be of importance to CCHP and the Camden patients they serve, but 
will also inform any expansion of CCHP’s programs. The Link2Care program has received 
4 
national attention (Gawande 2011) . And the CCHP’s 2012 Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
Innovation grant has funded four new sites that are implementing the Link2Care model in 
Allentown, Pennsylvania, Aurora, Colorado, Kansas  City, Missouri, and San Diego, California. 
 
3.  Related literature   
3.1. Brief literature review   
Transitional care programs come in  a variety of forms, and there is compelling evidence that 
these interventions can have large effects on s ubsequent utilization.  Naylor et al. (2011) 
reviewed the literature on th ese programs.  They studied 21 RCTs and found 9 that showed 
significant reductions in readmissions.   In our  own review of nine RCTs of care management 
programs with at least two home visits by nurses, we also find that some programs are shown to 
significantly reduce read missions but not all.1  Takeda et al. (2012) reviewed 25 RCTs of disease 
management interventions for chronic heart failure (CHF) patients.  They conclude that case management interventions led by a heart failure specialist nurse, as well as multidisciplinary 
interventions delivered by a team, are successful in reducing readmissions and mortality at 
twelve months.  
While the evidence is therefore mixed, Naylor et  al. point out that there were some common 
themes among the more-successful interventions.   In particular, they tended to be engaged with 
patients for a longer period of time—typically 2-3 months—and they usually included home 
visits by nurses.  In addition, they often included “comprehensive discharge planning with 
follow-up interventions that incorporate patient and caregiver goal setting, individualized care 
planning, educational and behavioral strategies, and c linical management.”  Link2Care aims to 
implement these best practices.   
One of the more successful interventions is described by Naylor et al . (2004):  a three-month 
intervention with nurse home visits for a popul ation over the age of 65 with congestive heart 
failure.  The treatment group had a rehospitalization or death at 52 weeks at a rate of 47.5% vs. 
61.2% for the control group, a difference that was st atistically significant w ith a sample size of 
239.   In terms of heterogeneity of effects, prior studies often lack the power to distinguish effects 
across subgroups.  Some studies (e.g. Shumway et al. 2008 and Jack et al. 2009) found a larger 
reduction in subsequent utiliza tion among "high risk" subgroups, identified as either having 
higher utilization prior to the intervention or more co-morbidities.  Studies that focus on mental-health patients tend to find little effect of interventions.  Link2Care targ ets patients who may be 
 
1 Rich et al. (1995), Naylor et al. (1999), Naylor et al. (2004), Daly et al. (2005), and Parry (2009) find significant 
reductions in subsequent utilization;  Siu et al., (1996), Brown et al. (2006), Allen et al. (2009), and Dixon et al. 
(2009) do not find such reductions.  
5 
the most amenable to such an intervention:  high-cost patients who suffer from multiple 
comorbidities, excluding patients who suffer exclusively from mental health conditions. 
3.2.  Distinguishing features of Link2Care 
A few main characteristics disti nguish Link2Care from interventions in the existing literature.  
First, the Link2Care model specifica lly targets “super-utilizers” of hos pital care.  Patients have to 
have had 2 or more admissions in  the past 6 months to qualify for the program.  A few studies 
targeted high-utilizers of emergency depart ments (Shumway et al. 2008, Spillane et al. 1996), 
but this is a very different (and lower cost) popul ation; we have not s een any other randomized 
evaluation of an intervention that targ ets hospital “high-utilizers” explicitly.2  Given the right-
skewness of health care spending, an intervention that can “bend the cost curve” for the highest 
cost patients would be of great interest.   
Second, it is unique in the sense that it has both an intensive clinical component and an intensive 
social component. The typical transitional care intervention tends to be more focused on the 
clinical component, such as desi gning an individualized care pl an, discussing patients’ needs, 
assisting patients in making follow-up appointments and sometimes accompanying them to these 
appointments.  Link2Care teams seem to make an exceptionally intense and aggressive effort to 
help patients obtain social services. For exampl e, the intervention team not only helps patients 
apply for housing, but accompanies them to the Social Security Administration and the Motor 
Vehicle Commission offices to obtain necessary identification.   
One intervention that appears to have similarly intensive social interventions as Link2Care was 
conducted by Shumway et al. (2008).  This intervention did not include a clinical component, 
however.  It did target patients who freque nted the emergency department and found a 
significant reduction in emergency department visits between 19 a nd 24 months after discharge.  
Other studies mention social workers used as part of the case management, but do not focus on 
their role.   
Third, whereas most existing studies focus on Medicare patients, VA patients, or patients with 
specific chronic disease diagnoses, there is no such restrictio n on the targeted population for 
Link2Care. The only requirement is that patients need to have some sort of insurance in order to be eligible. As a result, Link2Care is offered to a wide range of patients:  patients with different 
diagnoses; adults of all ages, and Spanish-speaking individuals (who are typically excluded from similar studies).

2 It is worth noting that while none of the other studies specifically focus on high-utilizers, their targeted 
populations, which are typically enrolled at hospital bedside before discharge, may still have a high hospitalization 
rate in general. 
6 
4.1. Enrollment 
Enrollment in the trial will be conducted by CCHP in a process similar to the one currently used 
to enroll patients into Link2Care.  Patients will be enrolled  at the two major Camden hospitals:  
Cooper University Hospital a nd Our Lady of Lourdes.   
Identification of eligible patients will rely on a Health Information Exchange (HIE) that CCHP 
helped to develop.  The hospital systems current ly in the HIE include Cooper, Lourdes, and 
Virtua (a local hospital system with an emerge ncy department in Camden).  CCHP is currently 
exploring adding two more nearby hospitals, Kennedy Hospital and Underwood Memorial 
Hospital, to the HIE.   
CCHP receives a daily data feed of individuals currently admitted to Cooper or Lourdes hospitals 
who have had two or more hospital admissions in th e prior six months to any of the hospitals in 
the HIE.  A staff member reviews the HIE along with electronic medical record data for pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria.   
Patients must satisfy the following criteria based on the records at the time of the index event: 
• Is currently admitted to Cooper or Lourdes hos pitals (still in hosp ital for recruitment) 
• Is 19-80 years old 
• Resides in the following ZIP codes: 08101 (PO ZIP code), 08102-08105, 08107 
• Has >=2 hospital admissions in the past 6 months (to hospitals in the HIE
3) 
• Has >=2 chronic conditions 
 
Patients must meet at least three of the followi ng criteria based largely on the electronic medical 
record: 
• Has >=5 outpatient medications 
• Has difficulty accessing services 
• Lacks social support 
• Has a mental health co-morbidity 
• Is actively using drugs  
• Is homeless  
Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria: 
• Already a subject in the RCT (treatment or control) 
• Deceased or discharged prior to triage or recruitment 
• Uninsured 
• Cognitively impaired 
• Oncology patient 
• Index hospitalization is for:

3 This currently includes Cooper (1 hospital), Lourdes (2 hospitals), and Virtua (4 hospitals), but will change if 
additional hospitals are added to the HIE. 
7 
– A surgical procedure for an acute problem 
– Complications of a progressive chronic disease with limited treatments 
– A mental health issue only with no co-morbid conditions  
 
A CCHP recruiter will approach individuals deemed eligible before the candidate is discharged 
from the hospital. The recruiter will explain the purpose, process,  risks and benefits of the study, 
including the randomization process and interv ention.  An informed consent form will be 
provided and explained. Candidate s can choose to enroll in the trial by signing the consent form. 
If the candidate enrolls, the recruiter will conduc t a short survey for which the subjects will be 
compensated $20 for their time.  Only after the co mpletion of the survey will the recruiter learn 
the results of the randomization and inform the patient.  
If an individual is randomized to the intervention, a care management team will be assigned to 
the case.  For individuals randomized to control, they will receive the usual standard of care, but 
not the additional CCHP intervention.  The standa rd of care in this case includes a printed 
hospital discharge plan prior to leaving the hospital.   
4.2.  Timing 
The trial will be piloted beginning in March or  April 2014, and we anticipate recruiting patients 
at least through June 2015.  We plan to continue en rollment until we attain at least 800 subjects 
(400 treatment, 400 controls), as described in the next section. 
 
5.  Data sources and outcomes  
5.1.  Data sources 
This plan details the initial analyses using admi nistrative claims data recorded from emergency 
department and inpatient stays in Camden-ar ea hospitals that are members of the Health 
Information Exchange (HIE) described above.  Th ese data can be matched to study participants 
using identifiers including the s ubject’s name, SSN, date of birth, gender and address.  The data 
include typical claims-data elements includ ing detailed information about admission and 
discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure code s, insurance status a nd hospital charges and 
receipts.   
The flow of how the HIE is used  to identify subjects, monitor their enrollment, and study their 
outcomes is described by the following figure: 
  
8 
Data Flow 
 
Below we describe analyses of the comprehensive nature of these data sources and our pursuit of 
complementary data sources. 
5.2.  Primary outcome 
The primary outcome we will analyze is whethe r Link2Care reduces hospital readmissions, as 
patients become more self-sufficient in securi ng medical care outside of  the hospital.  In 
particular, our primary outcome is any readmission within 180 days of discharge from the 
hospital stay when the subject was enrolled in  the study.  We will follow the CMS convention of 
not counting a transfer from the hospital where the patient was enrolled to another hospital as a 
readmission, as such a transfer would apply to th e current episode and the patient would not be at 
risk of entering the Link2Care Program, which begins once the patient returns home.  
5.3.  Secondary outcomes 
Other outcomes of interest include measures of healthcare utiliza tion, including emergency 
department (ED) visits, and trea tment intensity associated with readmissions (number of days, 
number of procedures, hospital charges, and hospital receipts).  We are interested in measuring 
effects in the short-term while the program is actively providing services (30-days, 90-days), and 
longer-term outcomes (180-days, 365 days).   Eligible Patients

5.4.  Power calculations and expected sample size 
We employed historical discha rge data from the two enrolling hospitals from 2003-2010 to 
perform power calculations.  First, we limited the sample to patients who are similar to those 
targeted by Link2Care:  two or more admissions in  the prior six months, between the ages of 19 
and 80, two chronic conditions recorded in the di agnosis codes in the prior year, the chronic 
conditions could not all be mental-health conditions, and the pa tient was not diagnosed with 
cancer in the prior year.  Note th at this approximates the inclusi on/exclusion criteria used when 
determining eligibility through th e HIE described above, but it doe s not include the criteria found 
in the electronic medical record. 
 
We determined that with 80% power and a test size of 0.05, a sample size of 800 would provide 
the statistical power to detect a 30% reduction in our primary outcome: 180-day hospital 
readmission.  Compared to the mean 180-day readmission rate of 0.30, this means that we would 
have the power to detect a drop to 0.21.  Although this is a large effect, it is within the set of 
estimates found in the literature for intensive cas e management featuring home visits described 
in the literature review. 
 
Another 180-day outcome where we would have the power to detect a 30% decline is the 
likelihood of 2 or more “hospital visits”, defined as outpatient ED visits plus inpatient 
readmissions, which averages 0.32.  Other 180-day outcomes where we have the power to detect 
a 20% change include any hospita l visit (an outcome that aver ages 0.54) and the likelihood of 
any outpatient ED visit (an average of 0.42).4   
 
If we have the power to detect a given percentage change in an outcome at six months, we have 
the power to detect an effect at twelve months as well (e.g. 365-day readmission).  Other 
outcomes where we have the power to detect a 30% decline over the following 365 days include 
the number of hospital visits (which averages 2.7) and the likelihood of 3 or  more visits (which 
averages 0.33).   
  
As a result of these power calculations, we plan to recruit until we atta in a sample size of 800 
subjects.  Based on historical data on the numbe r of eligible patients and the program capacity, 
we expect this will take 1-2 years.  CCHP is considering options that may increase the sample 
size of the study or the speed at which the targ et is reached (such as expanding to nearby ZIP 
codes). 
 
6.  Empirical model and planned tables 
 
4 For the power calculations we could only observe outpatient ED visits, but we expect to observe all ED visits in 
the future.  Given the higher means associated with all ED visits, we will have more power to detect a given 
percentage change in this measure.  
10 
6.1.  Empirical model 
The main analysis will compare outcomes for those who were randomized to receive Link2Care 
compared to those who were randomized to the control group.  
Consider an outcome, ܻ ,such as an indicator that the patient was readmitted to a hospital within 
180 days after discharge from the hospital.  For subject i, the estimating equation is: 
ܻ௜ൌߚ଴൅ߚଵͳሺTreatment ሻ௜൅ߚଶܺ௜൅ߝ௜ 
where ͳሺTreatment ሻ௜ is an indicator variable equal to one  if the subject was randomized to the 
treatment group and zero if the subject was randomized to the control group;  ܺ௜ is a vector of 
control variables.  These control variables shoul d be uncorrelated with the treatment indicator, 
but they can aid in the precision of the estimate.  We propose standard demographic and prior-
utilization controls:  age (5-year age bins), sex (indicator that the patient is male), race/ethnicity 
(indicators for African American and Hispanic), and measures of utilization in the 0-6 months prior to the enrollment admission and 7-12 months prior to the enrollment admission 
corresponding to the outcome in the model.
5  For example, if the outcome is a readmission 
indicator, the prior-utilization controls will include the number of admissions over those time 
periods; if it is a hospital visit (inpatient readmission or emergency department visit), the prior- utilization controls will describe the number of such visits, and for hospital charges and receipts 
they will be the totals  for those measures.   
ߚ
ଵis the parameter of interest and measures the Intent to Treat:  the causal effect of being 
randomized into the treatment group.  This can differ from the effect of the program if there is 
non-compliance:  some subjects in the treatment group may not be treated and/or subjects in the 
control group may be treated.  Fo r example, among those assigned to treatment, a patient who is 
transferred from the hospital to a long-term-care facility will no longe r be eligible for home visits 
and Link2Care will never begin, or some subjects could withdraw from the study prior to treatment.
6  We expect take up to be high, however, because it is currently close to 100% for 
those approached to be part of Link2Care, and we are randomizing subject s into treatment after 
they have consented to be part of the study.  We  anticipate that subjects  assigned to the control 
group will not participate in the program by design. 
To the extent that there is non-compliance, we will also estimate the effect of actually 
participating in Link2Care, us ing the random assignment into  the treatment group as an 
instrumental variable for program participation.  That is, we will estimate for subject i:    
 
5 In our power calculations, we considered variables that reduced the residual variation in the readmission outcomes, 
and we discovered that the number of admissions in the 0-6 months prior to admission for the index event, the 
number of admissions in the 7-12 months prior to the admission for the index event, age, and sex were useful in this 
regard.  We did not have the race/ethnicity variable available in our analysis dataset. 
6 We do not anticipate that the program will affect such tr ansfers, but we can investigat e by considering the rate at 
which subjects are discharged home.

This model will be estimated using Two-Stage L east Squares (2SLS), where the first stage is:

The resulting estimate of ߨଵ is the local average treatment effect:  the average treatment effect 
for those induced into program participation due to the random assignment into the treatment 
group. 
We will also consider time to readmission in da ys, which can be right-censored if the person has 
not been readmitted by the time of the analysis.  First, we will estimate Kaplan-Meier survival 
graphs associated with time to readmission for the treatment vs. the control group.  We will also 
estimate a Cox proportional h azard model for subject i:

where ሼߚଵሽ is the hazard ratio of interest. 
6.2.  Planned tables and figures 
The following tables list (1) variables that are ava ilable in the claims data from the hospitals that 
are part of the HIE, (2) data th at we expect to capture in a ba seline survey, and (3) data on the 
treatment intensity of the program that will be collected by CCHP.  Some of these variables we 
have not used in our preliminary analysis, and although we expect these standard variables will 
be of high quality, we cannot attest to the qua lity of every variable at this time.   
6.2.1.  Means comparison using administrative claims data 
Table 1 reports means of the characteristics of patients in the administrative claims data.  
Column 1 reports means for all inpatients admitted to the enrolling hospitals during our study 
period.  For each individual admitted over the trial period, we will randomly select one of their 
admissions to compare to the remaining columns. 
Column 2 reports means for all patients who m eet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the 
program.  The comparison of Columns 1 and 2 w ill highlight the extent to which the program 
targets high-cost patients.   Our estimates provide a causal effect of treat ment among the group of potential subjects who 
agree to be part of the study.  A natural question is how representative this group is compared to 
other high-cost patients who are less willing to participate.  Columns 3 and 4 compare those who 
are targeted for the intervention but do not agree to  be part of the trial to those who do agree to 
participate.  The refusal rate will be the num ber of observations in the refused column (3) 
divided the number of observations in the targeted column (2). 
12 
Columns 5 and 6 compare the patients who are ra ndomized into the treatment and the control 
groups.  This provides a check on wh ether the groups are similar to one another, as expected due 
to the randomization.  Column 7 reports the p-value from a test that the means in Columns 5 and 
6 are equal to one another. 
The first set of rows includes de mographic characteristics includi ng age, sex, race and ethnicity.  
We also observe the ZIP code of residence, which will be used to characterize the median 
household income of the area where the patient lives.   
 
We then characterize the index admission—the admission where the subj ects are enrolled—
including the hospital of admission, and whethe r the admission type was categorized as an 
emergency.  Intensity of treatment at th e index admission, such as length of stay, could, in 
principle, be affected by the treatment.  This will  be described in Appendix Table 1 rather than in 
this table, which is meant to consider the bala nce of observables across the treatment and control 
groups. 
 
From the longitudinal discharge data, we can also observe hospital utilization in the year prior to 
the trial, and we will compare various summary measures across the groups.   We will also compare the primary payer, defined as the payer responsible for most hospital payments over the 
prior year.   
6.2.2.  Means comparisons of trial subjects at baseline 
In addition to the discharge data, upon consenting to be in the trial the enrollment staff conducts 
an intake survey.  Table 2 describes the variables that are available in the baseline survey and 
proposes to collapse some of the answers into categories for the sa ke of brevity.  In particular, 
the survey asks questions about the usual pl ace where patients receive medical care, marital 
status and family support (which may be important here as Link2Care enlists the family to help 
the patient gain self-sufficiency), military serv ice history (to aid in understanding what programs 
the patient might be eligible to  receive), living arrangements, lit eracy, educational attainment and 
employment.  Two self-reported heal th questions are asked, as well as questions that verify the 
presence of certain conditions, including mental -health conditions, obesity, and substance abuse. 
To summarize the information collected at the ti me the participants are targeted, and from the 
baseline survey, CCHP calculates illness-sever ity scores, and we can compare these scores 
across the groups as well. 
6.2.3.  Outcomes 
Table 3 presents the results for the primary outco me: an indicator that the patient was readmitted 
to a hospital in the claims data within 180 days from discharge from the enrolling hospital.  
13 
To complement the analysis of the primary outcome, Figure 1 presents another way to 
characterize the time to a readmission:  the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function.  For 
each day, D, this will plot the fraction of each group that has “survived” at  least D days without a 
readmission.  At zero days both groups will have a probability of one, and the survival functions 
will fall as patients are readmitted over time.     
Of course we are interested in other outcom es as well, and although the power to detect 
differences for some of these outcomes is lower than the primary outcome, we may find effects 
that can yield insights into the sources of the main effects and inspire future research. Table 4 presents the results for secondary outcome s and other outcomes of interest.  Panel A of 
Table 4 includes estimates of effects on other type s of hospital use within the same 180 days of 
discharge: any use of an emergency department and the combined outcome of any emergency 
department visit or inpatient readmission; as we ll as inpatient readmissions that are from the 
emergency department and those that are not fro m the emergency department, as it is possible 
that the program prevents emergency readmissi ons but may promote scheduled readmissions.  
We will also measure the intensity of hosp ital utilization by considering the number of 
readmissions, the likelihood of two or more readmissions, the number of days in the hospital, hospital charges, and hospital receipts.  Hospital charges and receipts refl ect treatment intensity, 
but also reflect pricing decisions by hospitals an d efforts to receive payment, which will impact 
the interpretation of the findings.  They are typi cally skewed as well, and we will report effects 
of the program on the median of these measur es in robustness checks described below.  
We are interested in whether effects are f ound during the intervention versus longer-term 
outcomes where the power to detect effects is some what higher.  Panel B shows that we plan to 
consider 30-, 90- and 365-day measures of hospita l use, as well as days to readmission estimated 
with a Cox proportional hazard model.   
Different types of patients may experience different casual effects of the program.  After 
consulting the literature and pr actitioners, Panel C describes subsets that we would like to 
investigate separately.  These include patients with more admissions in the prior year, as the literature suggests that effects ma y be larger for higher-cost patie nts:  we can consider whether 
this relationship continues to be found within this set of high-cost patients.  In our examination of historical claims data, 70.4% of  patients likely targeted by the pr ogram had 3 or more visits in 
the prior year.  One innovation in this study is that we consider a large non-English speaking 
population in addition to English-speaking patients , and we can report differences in treatment 
effects across these two groups. 
Other subgroups of interest from the literature an d the nature of the intervention include those 
who reported substance abuse, psychiatric diso rders, and low family support at the baseline 
survey.  We will consider such groups if the subgroups represent a substantial share of patients, a 
calculation we will perform once we have the baseline survey results.  Although we are likely 
14 
underpowered to detect differences in effects across groups, we consider such comparisons 
important precursors for future research. 
6.2.4.  Program participation and treatment intensity 
Tables 3 and 4 report intent-to-tr eat effects associated with as signment to the treatment group.  
Table 5 describes the extent to which the treat ment and control groups received CCHP services. 
First, program intensity is explored by repor ting the means across the treatment and control 
groups in terms of:  whether the subject was assigned to treatment—expected to be 1 for 
treatment and 0 for controls as a check on any contamination.  Next, whether Link2Care was 
initiated will be considered.  Then we will report the length of the intervention in days and the 
number of home visits, which will include zeroes for subjects where Link2Care was not initiated.  
These estimates should be close to zero for the control group by design. 
The next set of characteristics provides some information on why Link2Care may not have been 
initiated. Patients who enter a long-term-care facility are not suitable for Link2Care, and this is 
not always known at the time of enrollment.  The claims dataset includes a discharge status, 
which reports whether the patient was discharged home or was transferred to another facility, which means the subject may begin the program but  only once they return home.  The discharge 
status also records whether the patient expired in the hospital. 
For the treatment group, we will know more about adherence to the goals of Link2Care, which 
we will report in Panel C:  whether a visit to  a PCP was achieved within 7 days, whether the 
patient visited a specialist if that was part of the discharge plan, aid in enrolling in welfare programs, whether transportation for appointments was arranged, enrollment in a medical day 
program for substance abuse or be havioral health, obtaine d an official identif ication or power of 
attorney, and whether the team advocated for the client over bills, court warrants, etc.  We will also report which of the two Link2Care teams the subject was assigned. 
6.2.5.  Robustness checks  
We will report empirical estimates using alternat ive empirical specifications, largely as a check 
on the robustness of the main results.   
First, Appendix Table 2 provides robustness checks for the primary-out come result shown in 
Table 3, including estimates with and without cont rols, and estimates from a logit model.  In 
addition, estimates will be presented from instrume ntal variable (2SLS) estimation, which allows 
us to estimate the effect of Link2Care for those induced into the program  due to the assignment 
to the treatment group: a local average treatment effect (LATE).  This will take into account the 
fact that some of those in th e treatment group never enroll in Link2Care and cases where patients 
in the control group were somehow treated.   
15 
Appendix Tables 3A and 3B repeat the comparisons  made in Table 4, but check for robustness to 
the estimator used (e.g. the logit model), the ex clusion of controls, a nd the LATE estimates.  
Days to readmission is not considered in th ese tables, as this measure is censored. 
Appendix Table 4 reports intent-to-treat and LATE estimates for three hospital utilization 
outcomes:  inpatient readmission, any emergenc y department visit, and any hospital use 
(readmission or ED visit).  The estimates will be shown across four time horizons:  30, 90, 180, 
and 365 days.  
 
7.  Preliminary analyses 
7.1.  Who are super-utilizers? Historical data comparisons 
We analyzed a limited dataset of claims da ta from 2002-2011 available to CCHP for the two 
main Camden hospitals: Cooper and Lourdes.  Thes e data contain a subset  of the variables we 
will access in the future.  Consis tent with the inclusion criteria,  we limited the data to patients 
who are between ages 19 and 80 at the index admission and who have not been diagnosed with 
cancer.   
We then identified “super ut ilizers”—our proxy for patients lik ely targeted by Link2Care—as  
individuals who at any point had two admissions within a 6 month period (the second of these 
was designated as the index admission), and had at  least 2 chronic conditions that were not 
exclusively mental health related.   For patients with more than one admission, we  randomly selected an index admission between 
2003 and 2009.  This ensures one year of pre- and 2 years of post-admission data.   As can be seen from Appendix Table 5, the targeted patients tend to be older, less likely to be 
female, tend to come from ZIP codes with lowe r household incomes.  By design, they also had 
higher hospital use in the year prior to the index admissions:  2.8 inpatient admissions accruing 
close to $200,000 in hospital charges and $25,000 in hospital receipts.  These levels are 2.5 to 4 
times higher than other patients admitted to these hospitals, with 1.1 admissions, $50,000 in 
charges and $6,000 in receipts.  These differences  did not converge in the year following the 
admission.  Rather, typical patients targeted by the program have 0.9 readmissions and 2.6 visits 
to the hospital when we include the emergenc y department.  Other patients have only 0.09 
readmissions on average, and 1 visit to the hospital.  In terms of hospital charges and receipts, those targeted by the program receive care that  totals $73,000 in charges ($8500 in receipts) 
compared to $6600 in charges ($773 in receipts) for other patients. 
7.2.  Camden-area hospital coverage  
16 
The longitudinal discharge data that we will access includes information for the three main 
hospital systems in the Camden area: Cooper, Lourdes, and Virtua.  It is of course possible for 
subjects to be admitted to other hospitals. To the extent that the intervention impacts hospital 
choice, this could lead to different rates of Camden-area hospital readmissions between the treatment and control groups that  could be unrepresent ative of effects on readmissions to any 
hospital.  
To investigate this issue, we studied discharg e data from New Jersey in 2011.  Although these 
data are not longitudinal in nature, they do allo w us to identify the ZIP code of residence of 
patients admitted to each hospital. When we consider admissions of patients who reside in the 
ZIP codes where CCHP recruits patients, we fi nd that 87.2% are admitted to Cooper, Lourdes, 
and Virtua hospitals.  Outside of these three hospital systems, the hospitals with the greatest share of patients from these ZIP codes are Kennedy Hospital, with 10.6%, and Underwood 
Hospital, with 0.43%.  As noted above, we are ho peful that the longitudina l discharge data will 
include these hospitals in the near future, wh ich would bring the cove rage rate up to 98.2%.
7  
The next largest share is attributed to Capital Hospital, at 0.41%, which is located in Trenton, NJ:  
36 miles north of Cooper Hospital.  
Of course, it is also possible that patients are admitted to hospitals in other states, including 
hospitals across the Delaware Rive r in Pennsylvania. We are curre nt working to obtain discharge 
data from that state to see how often Camden-a rea residents are admitted to those hospitals.  
Further, we hope to consider ot her longitudinal data th at includes all hospita ls, as described in 
the next section. 
 
8.  Planned next steps 
This plan focuses on analyses using longitudinal discharge data from the main hospitals in 
Camden, NJ.  We are currently working to gain access to other data sources that will provide 
additional outcomes of interest. 
8.1. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data 
To complement the claims data from the three hospital systems, other m easures of utilization 
may become available from the Centers for Me dicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).  In 
particular, we are interested in  enrollment into Medicaid, as this is often facilitated by 
Link2Care.  While Link2Care ta rgets individuals who are insu red, some are eligible for 
Medicaid but have not yet enrolled.   
 
7 For patients recruited from ZIP codes that are almost en tirely within the Camden city limits (08102, 08103, 08104, 
08105), Cooper, Lourdes and Virtua hospitals admit 92.6% of patients, and adding Kennedy and Underwood 
increases the coverage to 98.3%. 
17 
For subjects who are covered by Medicare and/or Medicaid at th e start of the study, we hope to 
study healthcare utilizati on.  First, we can revisit the read mission variable using all hospitals 
rather than the ones in our in itial set.  Second, we can analyze outpatient utilization, which 
provides a broader picture of the costs of the program as well as potential mechanisms by which 
the program may reduce re-hospitalization.   
In particular, a goal of the program is to ensu re that each patient sees a primary care physician 
with seven days after discharge and specialists soon after discharge if that is part of the discharge 
plan.  We hope to measure the rate at which this happens, as well as the number of physician 
visits over time.   
We anticipate that one mechanism for reducing re-hospitalization is closer monitoring of 
prescription medication, and we hope to measure the number of prescriptions filled and changes 
to the prescription regimen over time.  
Admission to a skilled nursing facility is costl y, and we hope to use CMS data to estimate the 
effects of program participati on on this outcome as well.   
In terms of a health outcome, we plan to consider is mortality, which is available from CMS 
data.  We believe mortality rates are not as high among this population that spans the entire adult 
age range compared to prior work th at focused on the elderly, however.   
8.2 Social services data 
An innovation of the program is the coaching of s ubjects to navigate the social-services system 
to enroll in programs that they are eligible to re ceive.  We are investigating a variety of data 
sources to measure these outcomes.  From the NJ Department of Human Services, we hope to 
link the subjects to program par ticipation data for TANF and SNAP programs.  From the NJ 
Department of Labor and the Pennsylvania Department of Labor, we hope to link subjects to 
unemployment insurance records to  measure employment and wages.  From the NJ Department 
of Corrections, we hope to measure incarceration  rates.   Homelessness services and housing 
stability programs administered by the Camden Housing Authority would allow us to measure 
participation as a potential mechanism for reducing hospital utiliz ation.  We are also 
investigating other sources of mortality data, including Social Security Administration data and NJ Vital Statistics data. 
 
9.  Interpretation 
This trial holds the potential to evaluate the value of the Link2Care program in terms of 
subsequent hospital utilization, and provide insight s into the types of patients who are most 
affected by Link2Care. 
18 
One caveat is that the program may have other benefits and costs that we are not currently 
measuring.  For example, Link2Care aims to improve  health and quality of life.  We will attempt 
to measure these with mortality, healthcare utilization associated with greater limitations using the CMS data, and social-services data such as employment measures. 
Link2Care may also have costs beyond operational costs, including the grea ter use of outpatient 
care and prescription drugs.  Again, we aim to expand the data sources to include longitudinal 
data on all healthcare use. 
Second, the study will consider a program that is well established.  If we find large effects, it will 
be useful to investigate how the lessons learned by CCHP can be replicated in other areas.   
Third, the study considers the enti re package of services provid ed by the Link2Care program.  It 
will not be possible to ascertain which components of the program are most effective or whether the impact is greater because they are offered t ogether.  Subsequent research could consider the 
components separately. 
Fourth, the study is particularly appropriate to st udy “partial equilibrium” effects of Link2Care.  
If Link2Care were to greatly expand and dramati cally affect hospital revenues, this could have 
broader effects that this study is not designed to estimate.

Source:  Historical claims data from Cooper Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital admitted between 2003 and 2009.  Sample is restricted to patients between the ages of 19 and 80 who have not been diagnosed with cancer.  Each observation is a randomly selected admission for an individual admitted to these hospitals.  Our proxy for "targeted" using claims data are those with two admissions within a 6 month period and had at least 2 chronic conditions that were not exclusively mental-health related.

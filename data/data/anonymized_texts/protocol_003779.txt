3.0 BACK GROUND  AND  RATIONA LE 
 
3.1 Bortezomib for Injection 
 
Scientific Background 
Bortezomib for Injection is a  small mol ecule proteasome  inhibitor  developed by Millennium  
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (Millennium)  as a novel agent to t reat hum an malignancies. 
Bortezomib is currently approved by the United States Food and D rug Administration (US 
FDA) and it is registered in Eu rope for the treatment of multiple  myeloma  patients who h ave 
received at least one  prior therapy. 
 
By inhibiting  a single molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affec ts multiple  signaling 
pathways.  The  anti-neoplastic effect of bortezomib lik ely involv es several distin ct 
mechanisms, in cluding  inhibition of  cell growth  and su rvival pathways, induction of 
apoptosis, and inhibition  of expression of  genes that control cellular adhesion, mi gration and 
angiogenesis.  Thus, the  mechanisms by which bortezomib elicits its antitumor activity may 
vary among tumor  types, and the  extent to whi ch each affected pathway is critical to the 
inhibition of  tumor  growth could also di ffer.  Bortezomib h as a novel pattern of cytotoxicity 
in National Cancer Institute  (NCI) in vit ro and in  vivo assays (Adams, Palombella et al. 
1999 ).  In addition, bo rtezomib h as cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft tumor  models, 
both as a single agent and in combin ation with chemoth erapy and radiation (Teicher, Ara et al. 
1999; Cusack, Liu et al. 2001; Steiner, Neumeier et al. 2001;  LeBlanc, Catley et al. 2002; 
Pink, Pien et al. 2002 ).  Not ably, bortezomib in duces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl- 
2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to convention al 
chemoth erapeutics (McConkey, Pettaway et al. 1999 ). 
Amended: 07/25/12  
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14)  
  
 Bortezomib is thou ght to be  efficacious in multiple  myeloma  via its inhibition of  nuclear 
factor κB (NF-κB) activation, its attenuation of  interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a  
direct apoptotic  effect, and possib ly anti-angiogenic and oth er effects (Hideshim a, Richardson  
et al. 2001 ). 
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
The clinical pharmacology characterization of  bortezomib h as been determined from ph ase 1 
studies in subj ects with solid tumo rs and hematological malignancies, and confirmed in 
phase 2 studi es in subj ects with multiple  myeloma. 
 
Bortezomib d emonst rates multi -compartmental pharmacokinetics. Follow ing intravenous 
administ ration of  1.0 m g/m2 and 1.3 m g/m2 dose, the mean first-dose maximum obs erved 
plasma concentrations of  bortezomib w ere 57 and 112 n g/mL, respectively in 11 p atients with 
multiple  myeloma  and creatinine  clearance values >50 mL/min p articipating in a 
pharmacokinetics study.  In sub sequent dos es, mean maximum o bserved plasma 
concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 n g/mL for the 1.0 m g/m2 dose and 89  to 120 n g/mL for 
the 1.3 m g/m2 dose.  The  mean elimin ation h alf-life of bortezomib upon multiple  dosing 
ranged from 40 to 193 hou rs.  Bortezomib is elimin ated mo re rapidly following  the first dos e. 
Mean Tot al Body Clearances were 102 and 112  L/h following  the first do se for doses of 1.0 
mg/m2 and 1.3 m g/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32  L/h following  subsequent dos es 
for doses of 1.0 and 1.3  mg/m2, respectively.  Clinical experience has shown th at the change 
in clearance does not result in ov ert toxi city from accumul ation in this mul tidose  regimen in 
humans. 
 
In subj ects with advanced malignancies, the  maximum ph armacodynamic effect (inhibition of  
20S activity) occurred within 1 -hour post dos e.  At the  therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m2 in 
subjects with multiple  myeloma, the mean proteasome inhibition at 1-hour post dose  was 
approximately 61%. 
 
The time course of proteasome  inhibition in subj ects is characterized by maximum in hibition 
observed within the  first hour after administ ration, follow ed by partial recovery of proteasome 
activity over the next 6 to 24 hou rs to within 50%  of the pretreatment activity.  On the  Day 1, 
4, 8, and 11 s chedule, variable (10%–30%) levels of proteasome  inhibition h ave been 
observed at next scheduled dosin g.  In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover 
proteasome  activity for normal cellular housekeeping functions b etween doses. 
The relationship b etween bortezomib pl asma concentrations and proteasome  inhibition can be 
described by a maximum  effect (Emax) model.  The Emax curve is initi ally very steep, with 
small changes in pl asma bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to  2.0 n g/mL relating 
to large increases in the  percent inhibition (0–60%).  After that, a plateau occurs where 
marginal increases of proteasome  inhibition are observed in spite of large changes in pl asma 
bortezomib concentrations. 
 
Clinical Experience 
It is estimated that more than 100,000 p atients have been treated with bo rtezomib, in cluding  
patients treated through Millennium -sponso red clinical trials, Investigator-Initiated Studies,

the US NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with comm ercially available 
drug.  Bortezomib h as been comm ercially available since 13 M ay 2003.  
 
The overall goal of the Millennium ph ase 1 program was to d etermine  the MTD and dos e- 
limiting  toxicity (DLT) of bortezomib in a  numb er of therapeutic settings involving  subjects 
with v arious advanced malignancies.  In a Phase I trial in p atients with refractory hematologic 
malignancies, the  MTD for a twice weekly for 4 weeks of a 42 day cycle was 1.04 
mg/m2/dose, with DLTs of thrombo cytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and 
malaise (Orlowski, Stinchcombe  et al. 2002 ).  The toxicity was greatest during the third and 
fourth weeks of therapy. In the  3-week schedule of bortezomib monoth erapy (4 doses, given 
on D ays 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 m g/m2/dose  (3 
subjects with G rade 3 diarrhea and 1 with p eripheral sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the 
MTD at this s chedule was 1.3 m g/m2/dose.  In a 35-day treatment cycle with 4 w eekly doses 
of bortezomib monoth erapy, the MTD  was 1.6 mg/m2/dose  and DLT included hypotension, 
tachycardia, diarrhea, and syncope. 
 
In phase 1 clinical studi es, anti-tumor  activity was reported in subj ects with  NHL, multiple 
myeloma, Waldenström’s Macroglobulin emia, squamous cell carcinoma  of the nasopharynx, 
bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinom a, and prostate cancer. 
 
Studies using  bortezomib as monoth erapy and in  combin ation with oth er chemoth erapy agents 
are continui ng. 
 
3.2 Biology of  Proteasome Inhibition 
The ubiquitin -proteasome pathway plays an essential role in the  degradation of  most sho rt- 
and lon g-lived intracellular proteins in eukaryotic cells.  At the  heart of this d egradative 
pathway is the  26S proteasome, an ATP  dependent, multi catalytic protease.  The 26S 
proteasome  plays a vital role in degrading regulatory proteins th at govern cell cycle, 
transcription factor activation, apoptosis and m etastasis.  Some of the targets of ubiquitin - 
proteasome  mediated degradation in clude p53, p2 1, p27, N F-
B, and Bcl-2.  Preclinical 
observations sugg est that inhibito rs of the proteasome can act through multiple  mechanisms to  
arrest tumor  growth, indu ce apoptosis, p revent tumor  spread and inhibit angiogenesis. Phase I 
trials have confirmed tolerability of the proteasome inhibitor  bortezomib  and have suggested 
possible  clinical activity. 
 
A numb er of key regulatory proteins are temporally degraded during the cell cycle by the 
ubiquitin -proteasome  pathway, and the  ordered degradation of  these proteins is required for 
the cell to p rogress through the  cell cycle and to undergo mitosis (King, Deshaies et al. 1996 ). 
One of the targets of ubiquitin -proteasome  mediated degradation is the  tumor  suppressor p53, 
which acts as a negative regulator of cell growth.  P53 is required for the transcription of  a 
numb er of genes involv ed in cell cycle control and DNA synthesis and also plays an impo rtant 
function in apoptosis indu ced by cellular damage including  ionizing radiation (Sherr 1996 ). 
Cyclins and the  cyclin-dependent kin ase inhibito rs p21 and p27 Kip1 are another set of 
growth regulatory proteins that are regulated by proteasome-dependent proteolysis (King, 
Amended: 07/25/12  
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14)  
  
Deshaies et al. 1996 ).   Both p21 and p27 can ind uce cell cycle arrest by inhibiting  the cyclin 
D-, E- and A-dependent kinases (Sherr 1996). 
 
 In addition, the  ubiquiti n-proteasome  pathway is required for transcription al regulation. 
Nuclear factor-
B (NF-
B) is a key transcription factor, who se activation is regulated by 
proteasome-mediated degradation of  the inhibitor  protein I
B (Palomb ella, Rando et al. 1994;  
Read, Neish et al. 1995 ).  Cell adhesion mol ecules (CAM)  such as E-selectin, ICAM-1, and 
VCAM-1 are regulated by NF-
B and are involv ed in tumor  metastasis and angiogenesis in 
vivo (Zetter 1993).  Du ring metastasis, th ese molecules direct the adhesion and extravasation 
of tumor  cells to and from the  vasculature to dist ant tissue  sites.  As su ch, tumor  cell 
metastasis will be limited by the down-regulation of  NF-
B dependent cell adhesion 
molecule expression.  N F-
B is also required in a  numb er of cell types to maintain cell 
viability as an anti-apoptotic  controlling  factor (Beg and Baltimo re 1996 ). Inhibiting N F-
B 
activation by stabilizing the I
B protein makes cells mo re sensitive  to environmental stress 
and cytotoxic agents, ultim ately leading to apoptosis.  
 
Altered degradation of  cell cycle control proteins can result in accelerated and un controlled 
cell division, and thereby promote  cancer growth and sp read.  Interfering with the  temporal 
degradation of  these regulatory molecules by blocking proteasome  function can lead to the 
inhibition of  cell growth  and the  initiation of  programmed cell death, th ereby arresting 
malignant cell growth.  In addition, inhibition of  proteasome-mediated degradation of  I
B 
will inhibit N F-
B activation and should m ake tumor  cells mo re sensitive  to 
chemoth erapeutic agents th at activate NF-
B. 
 
Collectively, these observations sug gest that inhibito rs of the proteasome  can act through 
multiple  mechanisms to  arrest tumor  growth, tumor  spread and angiogenesis.  The 
combin ation of  these mechanisms o ffers a novel approach to t reating human malignancies. 
Consist ent with this hypothesis, tumor  cells th at bear multiple  genetic defects, including 
impaired DNA repair mechanisms and aberrant cell cycle checkpoint controls, are sensitive  to 
the growth inhibito ry actions of  proteasome  inhibito rs both in vitro and in vivo. 
 
Bortezomib is a  dipeptidyl boronic acid inhibitor  with hi gh specificity for the proteasome, 
which is b eing developed by Millennium,  Inc. to treat hum an malignancies.  It is the  first 
member of this n ew class of anti-tumor  agents to come to hum an trials.  Phase I clinical 
studies have demonst rated that bortezomib is a  well-tolerated agent with minim al adverse 
effects.  In addition, it h as been shown th at bortezomib is capable of producing a  dose related 
effect on p roteasome inhibition wh en analyzed one-hour post in fusion.  T here is little inter- 
patient variability, with respons es at the lowest doses studi ed to d ate (Papandreou, D aliani et 
al. 2001; A ghajanian, Soignet et al. 2002 ). 
 
3.3 Study Dis ease and Rationale 
 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) are presently the fifth most common cause of cancer 
related death in the  United States.  Collectively, they account for approximately 4 to 5%  of all 
cancer-related deaths in Caucasian and Hispanic popul ations, and about 2%  in African- 
Amended: 07/25/12

IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14)  
  
American popul ations (Cunnin gham, Zalcberg et al. 1996 ).  How ever, because NHL tends to 
afflict a younger popul ation (the average age of all lymphoma  patients is about 42  years), the 
years of life lost is greater than in most oth er malignancies.  This ranks NHL fourth among all 
cancers with regard to their economic  impact in the  United States.  In 1997,  there were 
approximately 53,600 n ew cases of NHL, with o ver 23,800 d eaths attributed to the  disease 
(Cunnin gham, Zalcberg et al. 1996 ).  Thus, the  case-fatality rate for non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma  (ie. the number of deaths attributed to the disease expressed as a percentage of the 
incidence of the disease) is approximately 44%.  As with most h ematologic malignancies, 
there is a slight male predomin ance, with about 57% of all cases developing in males. 
 
The indol ent non -Hodgkin’s lymphom as comprise approximately one-third of all NHLs. 
Indolent lymphop roliferative disorders (including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small 
lympho cytic lymphoma  (SLL), the follicular lymphomas (FL), marginal zone lymphom as 
(MZL), and lymphopl asmacytoid lymphoma  (ie. Waldenstrom M acroglobulinemia (WM)), 
represent a class of diseases that are characterized by slow, p rogressive  tumor growth th at 
typically responds to alkylating agents.  While compl ete and partial remissions can be 
obtained in most p atients, ov er time, the disease becomes increasingly more refractory to 
chemoth erapy, prompting  the need for addition al, non-cross-resistant treatment approaches. 
 
A review of 204 p atients treated over a 19 year time span has helped to characterize the 
natural histo ry of indol ent lympho mas (Johnson, Rohatiner et al. 1995 ).  With a median 
follow -up du ration of  12.2 
years, the  median survival of this most ly conservatively treated group w as 9.2 years.  The 
study starkly illust rates the relapsing/recurring nature of the disease, with response  rates and 
duration of  response decreasing with subs equent relapses (see table below).  Sixty five percent 
of patients in this stu dy relapsed after initial treatment, with a  total of 37 patients ultim ately 
receiving a total of four or more courses of therapy.

Comparison of Response Rates, Response Durations and Survival Times After 
Treatment of Consecutive Recurrences of Follicular Lymphoma 
 
Treatment # Treated RR (%) Duration (years) Survival (years) 
First 204 88 2.6 9.2

Third 63 76 1.1 3.5 
Fourth 37 68 0.5 1.2 
 
An impo rtant finding  of this stu dy was that the durations of  first and second remission and 
subsequent su rvival were heavily influenced by the degree of response  to treatment.  Of  the 77 
patients who achieved CR with th eir first treatment, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 
54%, whereas 5-year DFS was about h alf of that (28%) for patients achieving only a PR. 
Similarly, median duration of  response  was 25 months for the 31 patients who achieved a CR 
after treatment for second relapse, but was only 9 months for those  patients achieving PR.  It 
is therefore impo rtant to id entify new treatment combin ations th at not on ly increase response 
rates, but th at have the potential to in crease the quality of respons e. 
 
 
 
3.4 Phase II Experience with Bortezomib in NHL  
 
Our group h as had a longstanding  interest in the  developm ent of novel proteasome 
inhibito rs dating back to our condu ct of the phase I clinical trial of bortezomib in p atients 
with h ematologic and solid tumor  malignancies (Aghajanian, Soignet et al. 2002 ).  This 
and another phase I study (Orlowski, Stinchcombe  et al. 2002)  demonst rated not on ly 
tolerability of the agent, with impo rtant ph armacologic endpoints, but also revealed 
significant activity in patients with multiple  myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and 
follicular lymphom a.  These observations sp awned a single-agent phase II study with 
bortezomib in p atients w ith indol ent lymphop roliferative disorders at MSKCC (protocol 
01-049).  Based on the  promising  activity of bortezomib in ind olent lymphoma, we 
expanded this t rial to a  large, multi center study.  The current protocol seeks to exploit the 
marked single-agent activity of bortezomib in non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma  by integrating it 
into a  standard convention al regimen for the treatment of these diseases. 
 
The phase II study of single-agent bo rtezomib (IRB # 01-049) in patients with p redomin antly 
relapsed or refractory indol ent non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma  (NHL) condu cted by our group h as 
recently been reported (O'Connor  2004; O'Connor 2005; O 'Conno r, Moskowitz  et al. 2009 ). 
Bortezomib w as administ ered at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 on a day 1, 4, 8 and 11 schedule every 21 
days.  The patients w ere heavily pre-treated with a  median of 3 prior therapies (2 prior therapies 
in MCL patients).  Ov erall the  drug was very well tolerated, with most p atients experiencing 
toxicities well known to be  associated with the  drug, including thrombo cytopenia, sensory

neuropathy, diarrhea, and asthenia.  Amo ng 18 assessable patients with FL, the overall response 
rate (ORR) was 50%, including  5 partial respons es (PR) and 4 p atients m eeting criteria for 
compl ete remission (CR)/compl ete response  unconfirmed (CRu).  Of 8 assessable patients with 
marginal zone lymphoma  (MZL), 3 achieved a PR, while  only 1 of the 6 patients with SLL 
show ed any response  to therapy (PR) (O’Connor  et al., Clinical Cancer Research 2009, in  
press).  Amo ng 36 assessable patients with M CL, the ORR was 50%, including 12PR and 6 
CR/Cru (O'Conno r, Moskowitz  et al. 2009 ).  Ov erall, the  median progression free survival 
(PFS) for responding p atients with M CL and all other non-MCL patients has been 7.8 and 12.3 
months respectively.  The median time  to response is also si gnificantly different among the 
differe nt sub -groups, wi th MCL and FL lympho ma patients demonst rating a median time  to 
response  (TTR) of 5 and 11 w eeks, respectively.  This p articular difference has potentially 
significant ramifications  regarding how m uch therapy to give before one can adequately assess 
drug activity in follicular lymphom a. 
 
Goy et al. at M.D. And erson Cancer Center began a broader single-agent, sin gle-institution 
study of bortezomib in patients with any B-cell neoplasm, regardless of their prior numb er of 
treatments (Goy, You nes et al. 2005 ).  Oth erwise, this and the  MSKCC studies were similar in 
design.  Of 60 registered patients, 33 h ad mantle cell lymphom a, 12 h ad diffuse large B-cell 
lymphom a, and the  remainder had a variety of other subtypes, including  small lympho cytic 
lymphom a, follicular lymphom a, Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulin emia, and a transformed 
lymphom a.  Ov erall, this popul ation of  patients w as more heavily pretreated, with a  median 
numb er of prior therapies of 3 in the MCL group and 4 in the  other NHL patients.  The 
overwhelming majority of patients h ad markedly elevated LDH and Beta-2-microglobulin 
prior to stu dy enrollment. Of 29 assessable patients with m antle cell lymphoma, 12 (41%) 
achieved a major response, with 6 (20.5%) of them attaining  a compl ete remission, and 6 
(20.5%) attaining a partial remission.  Ov erall, the  duration of  response was approximately 6 
months.  Among  the patients with di ffuse large B-cell lymphom a, only one of the 12 
assessable patients achieved a partial remission, with the  other patients demonst rating either 
stable or progressive  disease.  No activity was seen in p atients with sm all lymphocytic 
lymphoma  or in the  one assessable patient with t ransformed lymphom a.  While the numb ers 
of patients with oth er sub-types of NHL were small, the  collective experience suggests th at 
there may be significant differe nces among  the different sub -types of lymphoma. 
 
In addition to the  above  studies, two oth er phase II studies have treated patients with 
bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2, using  the twice weekly dosing schedule outlin ed above. 
The National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) reported on a  study in patients with, both 
treated and un treated, mantle cell lymphoma  (Belch, Kou roukis et al. 2004 ).  A tot al of 30 
patients w ere accrued, of whom 28 w ere assessable for response  at the time of reporting.  The 
numb er of prior treatments was limit ed to 2.  Interestingly, there was no di fference in ORR 
between chemonaïve and chemoth erapy refractory patients.  Among  the 13 patients who h ad 
no prior therapy, 6 achieved a PR (ORR 46.2%), while  among  the 15 previously treated 
patients, 6 achieved PR and 1 achieved a CRu (ORR 46.7%).  Most adverse events w ere grade 
1 or 2, althou gh there was an unusu al vascular leak syndrome that occurred in some  patients 
treated early in the  study that may have been attributed to the  fact that many of these patients 
had pre-existing  effusions.  Interestingly, this to xicity was not s een in oth er trials.  Straus et

al. have enrolled 45 patients with N HL (21 M CL, 12 FL, 5 Waldenstrom’s macroglobulin emia 
(WM), 4 Ho dgkin’s disease and 3 oth er) (Strauss, M aharaj et al. 2004 ). Respons es were seen 
in 7 of 18 M CL patients (1 CR/CRu, 6 PR), 2 of  11 FL patients (both PR with l ate respons es, 3 
months after initiation of  treatment), and 2 of  5 WM patients (both PR). No respons es were 
seen in patients with aggressive lymphom as.  Again, the  most common to xicities were grade 3-
4 thrombo cytopenia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy (along with  
the addition al toxicity of grade 3-4 anemia). 
 
The consist ent results in M CL prompt ed the  PINNACLE trial - a multi center phase II 
registration stu dy of single agent bo rtezomib in M CL.  The  centrally reviewed response rate in 
this t rial was 32%  (8% CR/CRu), with a  median time to progression (TTP) and du ration of 
response  (DOR) of 6.7 and 9.2 months, respectively (Goy, Bernstein et al. 2009 ). 
 
Collectively, these data demonst rate that bortezomib h as meaningful activity  in select sub- 
types of lymphom a, and perhaps mo re impo rtantly, that the duration of  response  can be 
clinically significant.  T he future challenge, of course, is trying to figure out how b est to 
integrate this p romising n ew class of molecules into the  present standards of  care for 
lymphom a. 
 
Rationale for R-CBorP 
 
Preclinical data in a SCID-beige lymphoma  xenograft mod el suggest that the efficacy of 
bortezomib with cytotoxic therapy is schedule dependent. D ata from our  laboratory (O'Connor  
2003)  have revealed that bortezomib and cyclophosphamide  are at least additive in their ability 
to delay and reverse xenograft tumor  growth.  The  optim al therapeutic effects are seen wh en 
bortezomib is given following  cytotoxic therapy. Simult aneous administ ration is in ferior to 
sequential administ ration. 
 
The addition of  rituximab to bo rtezomib in a  SCID xenograft mod el of lymphoma  also shows 
at least an additive  benefit (De Vos, M cBride et al. 2004)  (figure below). In other experiments 
(data not shown ), bortezomib h as shown cooperative activity with st eroids, as well.  Th ese 
data suppo rt the hypothesis th at integrating bortezomib in a  schedule-dependent manner into 
certain standard therapies is likely to be at least additive, if not synergistic, in the  treatment of 
non-Hodgkin’s lympho ma.

The impo rtance of vincristine, a cell-cycle dependent antimitotic  agent, in the treatment of 
slow ly growing lymphomas is qu estion able.  Single-agent efficacy of vincristine  in indol ent 
lymphom as has not b een shown in the  modern literature.  Furthermore, vincristine  and 
bortezomib both in cur the potential for neurotoxic adverse effects.  Replacing vincristine  with 
bortezomib, a  known active agent in indol ent lymphomas, in combin ation with 
cyclophosph amide, rituximab and prednisone  therefore offers the potential for greater activity 
in patients with relapsed/refractory indol ent NHL, and exploits the  cooperative interactions of 
bortezomib with cyclophosphamide, rituximab and st eroids.  
 
3.5 Phase I Results 
 
To determine  the (MTD) of bortezomib in combin ation with R-CP, we employed a modi fied 
Fibonacci dose  escalation schema. We initially sought to explore a weekly dosing  schedule of 
bortezomib, b ased on p romising  results from a  phase II trial of bortezomib combin ed with 
rituximab comparing weekly with twi ce-weekly administ ration (Saleh, Dakhil et al. 2005 ). 
During this po rtion of  the trial, the  starting doses of bortezomib and cyclophosph amide  were 
1.3 m g/m2 and 750m g/m2, respectively.  On the  second cohort (bortezomib 1.6m g/m2 and 
cyclophosph amide  750mg/m2), one  patient experienced a grade 3 diarrhea.  There were no 
further DLTs and the  maximum pre-planned dos es of bortezomib (1.8m g/m2) and 
cyclophosph amide  (1000mg/m2) were therefore consid ered to be  the MTD  and M aximum 
Administ ered Dose  (MAD).  How ever, as we neared the  compl etion of  dose escalation using 
weekly administ ration, new reports from the  bortezomib +  rituximab trial cast doubt about 
whether weekly dosing is the  most pot ent mode  of administ ration.  We therefore amended the 
Phase I trial to allow for dose escalation with a  twice-weekly schedule of bortezomib 
administ ration in our  combin ation regimen.  A minimum of  three patients w ere follow ed for at 
least one compl ete cycle (ie. 3 w eeks) of therapy before the trial entered patients at the next

dose level. Three patients were initially entered in the  twice-weekly schedule at a dose of 1.0 
mg/m2 bortezomib and 750 m g/m2 of cyclophos phamide  (with a constant dose of rituximab, 
375 m g/m2 and prednisone, 100 m g/day). Cyclophosph amide  dose was increased to 1000 
mg/m2, and bo rtezomib w as increased to 1.3 mg/m2 and 1.5 m g/m2.  As reported at the 2008  
Annu al Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Gerecitano, Portlock et al. 
2008 ), the second cohort (1.3 m g/m2 bortezomib,  750 m g/m2 cyclophosp hamide) required one 
expansion due  to neutropenic fevers.   When a second n eutropenic fever was seen, the  
protocol was amended to include filgrastim suppo rt, and six  addition al patients w ere added at 
this dose  level to assess safety.  One  of these patients experienced two DLTs (a grade 4 
thrombo cytopenia and a grade 4 neuropathy) and the cohort was again expanded, with no 
further DLTs.  Doses were further escalated to the  highest pre-planned dose levels (1.5 mg/m2 
bortezomib, 1000 m g/m2 cyclophosph amide) without further DLTs. Altho ugh this hi ghest 
dose level is the  MTD as defined by our protocol, we  have decided to b ring the  penultim ate 
dose level (1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib, 1000 m g/m2 cyclophosph amide) forward into the  phase II 
portion of  the study.  Th is decision w as made after consid erations regarding our phase II 
experience with si ngle-agent bo rtezomib and dis cussions with the  attendings on the  
lymphoma  service at MSKCC and Columbia  Univ ersity.  In order to allow for maximum 
dosing  flexibility and patient convenience, we investigated the safety and efficacy of using 
pegylated G-CSF (Neulasta) during bortezomib administ ration in an expanded cohort at the 
MTD of  the phase I study. A separate cohort of 10 patients w as added at the twice-weekly 
bortezomib (Bor) 1.3 mg/m2 + cyclophosph amide  (C) 1000 m g/m2 level to assess the  safety of 
administ ering overlapping pegfilgrastim (PegG) instead of filgrastim (G). In this cohort, PegG 
was given with bo rtezomib on d ay 2.  To  evaluate the safety of pegfilgrastim ov erlapping with  
4 dos es of bortezomib, to xicities and CBCs for patients in the  PegG group were compared 
with those  of patients treated at identical doses of R-CBorP given non -overlapping  G suppo rt. 
All toxi cities and CBC trends w ere similar, with the  exception of  a significant but mild  
decline in platelets in the  PegG group.  Final results of the phase I trial have been recently 
publish ed (Gerecitano, Portlock et al.). 
 
 
 
3.6 Rationale for Subcutaneous Dosi ng of Bortezomib 
 
In 2008, M oreau et al. first described the  subcutaneous administ ration of  bortezomib in a 
group of patients with multiple  myeloma  (MM).  At the  2010 annual meeting of the American 
Society of Hematology (ASH), this group p resented data from a  phase III randomi zed 
controlled trial comparing intravenous and sub cutaneous routes of administ ration of 
bortezomib with or  without dexamethasone in patients with MM (Moreau, Pylypenko et al. 
2010 ).  As expected, pharmacokinetic parameters were different in the  two arms, with p eak 
serum levels greater in the 74 patients in the  IV arm (223 n g/ml) compared with the  148 
patients in the  SC arm (20.4 n g/ml).  Interestingly, the area under the curve for both routes of 
administ ration w as identical.  Du ring this t rial, it w as found th at several toxicities, mo st 
impressively sensory peripheral neuropathy, was markedly and significantly lower in patients 
given bortezomib sub cutaneously: grade 3-4 toxicity rate was 70%  for the IV arm and 57% 
for the SC arm; any grade peripheral neuropathy was seen in 53%  of IV patients and 38%  of 
SC patients, p =  0.04).  Efficacy of the SC route was indistin guishable from that of the IV

IRB#: 05-103 A(14)  
  
route of administ ration, with an overall response  rate of 52% in both arms.  Based on this 
randomi zed trial, the  SC mode  of administ ration appears to in crease the safety profile of 
bortezomib while  maintaining  identical efficacy.  We have therefore chosen to in corporate 
this mode  of delivery into the  current protocol. 
 
3.7 Design of Phase II 
 
In the  phase I portion of  this stu dy, both dosi ng schedules were well tolerated. The  phase II 
portion of  this stu dy utilizes a randomi zed enrollment to further assess these two s chedules in 
a larger numb er of patients.  Both arms will utili ze a subcutaneous route of administ ration for 
bortezomib.  
 
The weekly dose schedule (Arm A) chosen for phase II was the MTD  (see sections 3.5 and 
4.1.1 ). The  decision for the phase II dose in the  twice-weekly arm (Arm B) was based on 
several factors:  The phase I dose escalation of  this schedule proceeded to the  highest pre- 
planned level with filgrastim suppo rt without any DLTs. How ever, our phase II experience 
with sin gle-agent bo rtezomib at this dose  and schedule show ed clinically important adverse 
effects, especially with respect to n europathy.  Although this hi ghest dose  level is the  MTD as 
defined by our protocol, the  phase I investigators decided to b ring the penultimate dose level 
(1.3 m g/m2 bortezomib,  1000 m g/m2 cyclophosp hamide) forward into the  phase II portion of 
the study. 
 
Because of the need for a randomi zed phase II design to assess the  optim al dosing  schedule, 
twice the numb er of patients is required (for two randomi zed arms). 
 
Interim Safety Analysis  
 
Althou gh the  SC route of administ ration s eems to in crease the safety of bortezomib 
administ ration, it h as not been explored in combin ation with oth er agents.  For this reason, an 
interim safety analysis is  planned after the enrollment of 6 patients in each treatment arm.  If 
any 2 of the first 6 p atients enrolled to each arm experiences a dose limiting  toxicity (DLT, as 
defined below), 6 further patients will be  enrolled in that arm at a lower dose of bortezomib 
(see table under section 12.2 ).  One  further dose reduction will be  allowed in each arm if 
necessary.  The  dose level at whi ch < 2/6 p atients in each arm experience a DLT will be  used 
for the remainder of the study.  If > 2/6 p atients experience a DLT even after 2 dose 
reductions in either arm, that arm will be  terminated, and an amendment to the protocol will 
be planned to revert to IV treatment in th at arm. 
 
Definition of Dose  Limiting Toxicity 
 
The definition of  DLT used in the  phase 1 portion of this t rial will be  used for the interim 
safety analysis. 
 
DLT will be  defined as any of the following events that are attributed to the  study drug 
combin ation and occur during the first cycle of drug administ ration:

ANC  < 1000 cells/mm3); 
 
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25,000 l asting for 7 consecutive  days), 
platelets < 10,000 x  1 day, or platelets < 25,000 associated with a  bleeding

Neurosensory toxicity of Grade 2 with p ain or any neurosensory toxicity higher 
than grade 2 (by Common To xicity Criteria 4.0 defined as “a disorder

Deterioration in the  platelet count, h emoglobin, or  granulocyte count m ay represent either drug 
toxicity or progression of  disease.  Therefore, frequent CBCs should be  obtained while  the 
patient is on stu dy.  If a significant decline in peripheral counts o ccurs, drug therapy should be 
stopp ed and bone  marrow examination should be  performed to d ocument the  mechanism of  the 
deterioration in the  blood  counts. H ematologic toxicity will be  graded according to the  followi ng

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNO STIC A GENTS 
 
5.1 Bortezomib PS-341 (NSC # 681239)  
 
Bortezomib for Injection is a  sterile lyophili zed powd er for reconstitution and is suppli ed in 
vials containing  bortezomib and m annitol at a 1:10 ratio.  For example, vials containing  3.5 
mg of bortezomib contain 35 mg  of mannitol.  
 
5.1.1  Availa bility: Bortezomib is a  proteasome  inhibitor  suppli ed to inv estigators by 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 
5.1.2  How  Supplied and Preparation: Drug is availa ble in sterile, single-use vials 
containing 3.5 mg of bortezomib.  For SC administ ration, each vial of 
bortezomib for Injection should be  reconstitut ed under a laminar flow biolo gical 
cabinet (hood ), within 8 hou rs before dosin g, with 1.4 mL of normal (0.9%) 
saline, sodium chloride injection, so that the reconstitut ed solution contains 
bortezomib at a concentration of  2.5 m g/mL. The  reconstitut ed solution is clear 
and colorless, with a  final pH of  approximately 5 to 6. Dissolution is completed in 
approximately 10 seconds. Reconstitut ed bortezomib should be  administ ered 
prompt ly and in no case more than 8 hou rs after reconstitution.  
 
Dosage  and Administration 
 
Bortezomib m ay be administered intravenous ly (IV) at a concentration of  1 
mg/mL, or subcutaneously  at a concentration of  2.5 mg/ml.  When adminis tered 
intravenous ly, bortezomib is administ ered as a 3 to 5 second bolus  IV inj ection. 
 
Because each route of administ ration h as a different reconstitut ed concentration, 
caution should be  used when calculating the volume to be  administ ered. 
 
Administration Precautions 
 
The drug quantity contained in one  vial (3.5 mg) may exceed the  usual dose 
required.  Caution should  be used in calculating the dose to prevent ov erdose. 
 
When administ ered sub cutaneously, sites for each injection (thigh or abdomen) 
should be  rotated.  N ew inj ections should be  given at least one  inch from an old 
site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, erythematous, or 
indurated. 
 
If local injection site  reactions o ccur following  bortezomib administ ration 
subcutaneously, a less concentrated bortezomib solution (1 mg/mL instead of 2.5 
mg/mL) may be administ ered sub cutaneously.  Alt ernatively, the IV route of 
administ ration should be  consid ered. 
 
Bortezomib is an antineoplastic.  Procedures for proper handling and disposal 
should be  consid ered.

In clinical trials of  bortezomib IV, lo cal skin irritation was reported in 5% of 
patients, but extravasa tion of bortezomib was not associated with tissue 
damage. In a clinical trial of subcutaneous bortezomib, a local reaction was 
reported in 6% of patients as an  adverse event, mostly redness. 
 
 
5.1.3  Bortezomib is cytotoxic: As with all cytotoxic drugs, caution is required when 
preparing and handling bortezomib solutions.  Cytotoxic drugs should on ly be 
handled by staff specially trained in the  safe handling of such preparations. The 
use of gloves and oth er appropriate protective clothing is recomm ended.  In case 
of skin contact, wash the  affected area immediately and th oroughly with so ap and 
water for at least 15 mi nutes.  If product contacts eye, imm ediately flush eye 
thoroughly with w ater for at least 15 minut es.  Alw ays contact a physician after 
any form of body contact. All m aterials that have been used for preparation 
should be  dispos ed of according to standard practices. A l og must be  kept of all 
dispos ed materials. 
 
5.1.4  Storage and Stability: Vials containing  lyophili zed bortezomib for Injection 
should be  stored according to the  label requirements.  For the United States, sto re 
at USP Controlled Room Temperature which is 2 5ºC (77ºF); excursions p ermitted 
from 15 to 30ºC  (59 to 86º F).  To d ate, stability data indicate that the lyophilized 
drug product is st able for at least 18 months wh en stored und er the recommended 
conditions. Stability studies are ongoing, and Mil lennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
will noti fy the investigator should this in formation be  revised during the condu ct 
of the study. 
 
5.1.5  Schedule and Route of Administration.  Drug will be  administ ered only to 
eligible patients und er the supervision of  the investigator or identified sub - 
investigator(s).  Patients m ay be treated on an out -patient basis, if  possibl e. 
The pharmacist will p repare the drug under aseptic conditions.  The  amount (in 
mg) of drug to be  admin istered will be  determined based on bo dy surface area. 
Body surface area is to be  calculated based on b ody weight usi ng a standard 
nomo gram (See Appendix C).  The  dose should be  calculated on D ay 1 of each 
cycle; the dose administ ered should remain the  same throughout each cycle but 
should be  recalculated at the start of the next cycle.  If a patient experiences a 
notable change in weight within a  cycle, as determined by an uns cheduled weight 
assessment, th en the  patient’s dose  should be  recalculated at that time  based on 
clinical judgment. The appropriate amount of  bortezomib will be  drawn from the 
injection vi al and administ ered as a subcutaneous injection.  Vi als are for single 
use administ ration. 
 
Patients randomi zed to t he weekly dosing schedule (Arm A) will receive 
bortezomib as a subcutaneous inj ection on d ays 2 and 8, follow ed by a one week 
rest period.  Patients randomized to the  twice-weekly dosing schedule (Arm B) 
will receive bortezomib as a subcutaneous inj ection on d ays 2, 5, 9, 12,  follow ed 
by a one week rest period.

Precautions and Restrictions 
 
It is not known wh at effects bortezomib h as on hum an pregnancy or development of 
the embryo or fetus.  Th erefore, female patients participating in this stu dy should 
avoid b ecoming pregnant, and m ale patients shou ld avoid imp regnating a  female 
partner.  Nons terilized female patients of  reproductive age and m ale patients should 
use effective methods of  contraception th rough defined periods du ring and after 
study treatment as specified below. 
 
Female patients must m eet 1 of  the followi ng: 
• Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or  
 
• Surgically sterile, or 
 
• If they are of childb earing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of 
contraception from the  time of signing the informed consent form through 30 days 
after the last dose  of bortezomib, or agree to completely abstain from h eterosexual 
intercourse. 
 
It is st rongly recomm ended that at least 1 of  these 2 methods be  highly effective (see 
  examples below).   
Highly effective methods Other effective methods (barrier methods) 
Intra-uterine devices (IUD) Latex condom 
Hormonal contraceptives (birth control pills/oral 
contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, 
contraceptive patches, or contraceptive implants) Diaphragm with spermicide 
Cervical cap 
Sponge 
If one of the highly effective methods cannot be used, using 2 effective methods at the same time is 
recommended. 
 
Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status post v asectomy) must agree to 1 of 
the followin g: 
• Practice effective barrier contraception du ring the entire study treatment period and 
through a minimum of  30 days after the last dose  of study drug, or compl etely abstain 
from h eterosexual intercourse.

5.4.1   
Mechanism of action: Decreases inflammation by suppression of  migration of 
polymorphonu clear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability; 
suppresses the immune  system by reducing activity  and volume  of the lymphatic 
system; supp resses adrenal function at high doses. Antitumor  effec ts may be 
related to inhibition of  glucose transport, phosph orylation, or  induction of  cell 
death in imm ature lymphocytes. Anti emetic effects are thought to o ccur due to 
blockade of cerebral innervation of  the emetic center via inhibition of 
prostaglandin synthesis.

IRB#: 05-103 A(14)  
  
 
6.1.2  All p atients must h ave measurable disease, defined as at least one  lesion t hat can 
be accurately measured in at least one  dimension  (longest diameter to be  recorded 
as >2 cm with conventional techniqu es or as >1 cm with spi ral CT scan).  Lymph 
nodes measuring < 1 cm in the  short axis are consid ered normal. Patients with  
WM and no m easurable lymphadenopathy are allowed, and will be  assessed using 
the criteria of the Forth International Workshop on WM. 
 
6.1.3  Patients must h ave received at least one  prior chemo or  immunoth erapeutic 
regimen of any kind, but  no mo re than three prior regimens of  conventional 
cytotoxic therapy, and must be  off all cytotoxic chemoth erapy for at least four 
weeks prior to stu dy enrollment (6 weeks for BCNU or mitomycin C, 12 w eeks 
with recovery to baseline counts for radioimmunoth erapy).  Patients are allowed 
to have received one course of prior radioimmunoth erapy (RIT: either 
tositumom ab or ibritumomab).  Prior recipients of  stem cell transplantation will 
be included, with the  preparative cytoreductive and high-dose therapies counted 
collectively as one  prior therapy. 
 
6.1.4  Patients must not h ave received any therapeutic mono clonal antibodi es (e.g. 
rituximab, tositumom ab, ibritumom ab, alemtuzumab, etc.) within 3 months of 
enrollment.  Patients who h ave been treated with mono clonal antibodi es within 3 
months m ay be enrolled if they show progression of  disease on this th erapy, as 
long as they have not received the  treatment within 7 d ays of enrollment. 
 
6.1.5  Age greater than or equal to 18  years. Because no dosing  or adverse event data are 
currently available on the  use of bortezomib in p atients <18 years of age, children 
are excluded from this stu dy but will be  eligible for future pediatric single-agent 
trials, if applicable. 
 
6.1.6  Karnofsky Performance Status >
  (see Appendix B). 
 
6.1.7  Patients must h ave adequate organ and m arrow function as defined below (within  
14 days of study drug administ ration):

6.1.9  The effects of bortezomib on the  developing human fetus at the recomm ended 
therapeutic dose are unknown.  For this reason, and because bortezomib b elongs 
to a new class of antineoplastic agents th at may be teratogenic, wom en of child- 
bearing potential and m en must agree to use  adequate contraception (hormonal or 
barrier method of  birth control) prior to stu dy entry and for the duration of  study 
participation. Should a  wom an become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while 
participating in this stu dy, she should in form her treating physician imm ediately. 
 
6.1.10  Patients must h ave no signs of  congestive heart failure class III/IV according the 
New Yo rk Heart Failure Guid elines (see Appendix D) uncontrolled angina, severe 
uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute 
ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to stu dy entry, any 
ECG abnormality at screening must be  documented by the investigator as not 
medically relevant. 
 
6.1.11  Patients must h ave the ability to und erstand ramifications of  the study, and the 
willin gness to si gn a written informed consent document. 
 
6.1.12  Volunt ary written informed consent must be  obtained before performance of any 
study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the  understanding 
that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without p rejudice to 
future medical care. 
 
6.1.13  Female subject is either postm enopausal for at least 1 year before the screening 
visit, is su rgically sterilized or if they are of childb earing potential, agree to 
practice 2 effective methods of  contraception from the  time of signing the 
informed consent form through 30 days after the last dose  of bortezomib, or  agree 
to compl etely abstain from heterosexual intercourse. 
 
6.1.14  Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postv asectomy) must agree 
to 1 of  the followin g:  practice effective barrier contraception du ring the entire 
study treatment period and through a minimum of  30 days after the last dose  of 
study drug, or compl etely abstain from h eterosexual intercourse. 
 
 
6.2 Subject Exclusion Criteria

A:  Patients will be seen on or within 7 days prior to day 1 of each cycle, more frequently at treating MD’s discretion. 
B:  With the exception of screening, CBCs should be perf ormed within a 24 hour window prior to treatment.  Day 2 CBCs of each cycle are optional. A CBC should be perf ormed and resulted 
within 24 hours of all Bortezomib treatments. 
C:  Serum pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential only). 
D:  Continued treatment f ollows the same pattern of f ollow-up examination as cycles 3 and 4. Treatment continues for up to 6 or 8 cycles in total, depending on response.  Please see the 
duration of therapy section in protocol for details (Section 4.3). 
E:  Radiologic evaluation and f ollow up visits will continue after treatment, starting 6 months after the final visit, and continue every 6 months for the first two years, and every 12 months 
thereafter (or more frequently at discretion of treating MD) until the patient begins another treatment regimen. 
F:  Radiologic studies at the end of cycle 4 will include CT: CA , PET scan, and, if the patient had a history of disease in neck, a CT: Neck.  CT measurements should be perf ormed during the 
3rd week of cycle 4. 
G:  Baseline, restaging, and post-treatment radiologic studies will include a CT: CAP, PET scan, and CT: Neck (only if history of disease in neck). All patients on study will have PET and CT 
scans perf ormed during the Cycle 4 radiologic evaluation. Thereafter, once a patient enters complete remission (CR), then only CT’s (chest/abdomen/pelvis and neck, if necessary) should be 
obtained. End-of treatment restaging radiologic studies should be performed 3-4 weeks after the last dose of bortezomib. Radiologic documentation must also be provided for patients 
removed f rom study for progressive disease. 
H: Tumor measurements should be documented after each radiologic assessment that occurs while the patient is on the study (including unscheduled scans ordered at the discretion of the 
treating physician, scans that require patient to go off  study, and any scan ordered per protocol.) 
I:   Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be included as part of the end of treatment evaluation (f inal visit)  in all patients who achieve a radiologic CR and in whom bone marrow involvement 
was documented in the pre-study evaluation.  If there is radiologic evidence of a CR at interim restaging in patients with documented bone marrow involvement at baseline, a bone marrow 
biopsy and aspirate should be perf ormed prior to Cycle 6 Day 1 to confirm radiologic CR. 
J:   Serum Protein Electrophoresis should be perf ormed at baseline, at restaging, and repeated at end of treatment, if baseline value was abnormal or the patient has Waldenström’s 
Macroglo bulinemia. 
K:  Baseline laboratory evaluations and physical examination are to be conducted within 14 days prior to administration of study agent.  Scans must be done within 6 weeks prior to enrollment. 
Bone marrow biopsy must be done within 4 m onths prior to enrollment. 
L. With the exception of screening, serum chemistries should be perf ormed within 7 days prior to treatment. Serum Chemistry includes: Albumin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, 
bicarbonate, BUN, calcium, chloride, creatinine, glucose, potassium, total protein, SGOT[AST], SGPT[ALT], sodium, serum cryoglobulins (quantitative), magnesium, phosphorus, uric 
acid. Serum chemistries do not need to be resulted prior to treatment on Day 1. 
M. Patients with Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia must have these labs perf ormed at screening, restaging and at 6 week f ollow up f rom first negative values in CR is achieved.  These tests 
are    strongly encouraged for all patients but only required for Waldenström’s Macroglo bulinemia patients. 
N. Final visit evaluation will take place 30 days +/- one week after the last dose of bortezomib. While every attempt will be made to collect this final visit data, it is understood that medical 
and/or logistical reasons may arise that could potentially interfere with the ability of the patient to attend the final visit. If any patient is unable to comply wih the final visit, the reason(s) for 
this will be documented in the medical records and this would not be considered a protocol violation.

10.0 EVALUATION DUR ING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION 
 
See the Study Calendar (Section 9.0)  for scheduled evaluations du ring treatment.  For the 
purposes of this stu dy, patients will be  reevaluated for response with a  CT and PET scan after 4 
cycles and 3-4 weeks after the last dose  of bortezomib.  A follow -up visit will be  scheduled 1 
month after compl etion of treatment, with repeat CT scans every 6 months in the first two  years. 
Two years post compl etion of  treatment, patients should be  re-imaged at least every 12 months, 
with int erim im aging at the discretion of  the treating physician. 
 
11.0 TOXICI TIES/SIDE EFFECTS 
 
11.1 Expected Adverse Events Asso ciated with Bortezomib 
 
Toxicity will be  described according to NCI Common To xicity Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.0.  Toxicity will be  evaluated on day 1 of each cycle.  Expected 
toxicities are described in the  information suppli ed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
For the list of  potential risks and adverse events refer to the  section d etailing Reported 
Adverse Events and Potential Risks (section 5.1.6 ).  Further details on the  potential risks of 
bortezomib m ay be found in the  Investigator Brochure.

sodium and fluid retention, imp aired skin h ealing, increased risk of  infection, 
osteoporosis, skin atrophy, adrenocortical insu fficiency , cataracts, glaucoma, 
Cushin g's syndrome, hyperglycemia, tuberculosis  reactivation 
 
12.0 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODI FICATIONS  
 
Before each drug dose, the patient will be  evaluated for possible  toxicities that may have 
occurred after the previous dos e(s).  Toxicities are to be  assessed according to the  NCI Common 
Terminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.  
Neuropathic pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy are to be  managed as described in T able 
12.2.

Before day 1 of each cycle, platelets must be  ≥ 50,000/ µl and Absolute  Neutrophile  Count 
(ANC) must be  ≥ 1,000/ µl. On bo rtezomib -only treatment days, platelets must be  ≥ 25,000/ µl, 
and ANC  must be  ≥ 100/ µl. 
 
Dose  escalation will not be  allowed in any patient, and th ere must be  at least 72 hou rs between 
each dose  of Bortezomib. Skipped dos es of bortezomib will not be  made up. 
 
12.1 Previously established or new toxicities observed at any time, with the exception of 
neuropathic pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy, are to be managed as follows: 
 
12.1.1  Patients who d evelop a  febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 hematologic toxicity can be 
treated with a  repeat cycle after holding  the dose for up to two w eeks and 
allowing  blood count recovery to either the pre-treatment criteria (dose 1 of any 
cycle – see section 6.1.7 ), or 25,000/m cl for platelets and 100/m cl for absolute 
neutrophil count (on days when bortezomib is given alone within each cycle). 
Cytokine suppo rt can be given as outlin ed in “Suppo rtive Care,” section 4 .2. 
Should the  patient develop a  second Grade 4 neutropenia or neutropenic fever, 
then the  dose of cyclophosphamide  should be  reduced to 750 m g/m2. 
 
12.1.2  If, after treatment has been held, the  toxicity does not resolve, as defined above, 
treatment must be  discontinued. 
 
12.1.3  Dose  interruption or  study discontinu ation is not required for lymphop enia of any 
grade. 
 
12.1.4  Should the  patient develop a  second Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, then after 
resolution as above, the dose of bortezomib should  be reduced by one dose level 
(see table below und er section 12.2 ).  A s econd d ose reduction will be  allowed if 
grade 4 thrombo cytopenia persists.  
 
12.1.5  Drug should be  held in patients who d evelop any treatment-related Grade 3-4 
non-hematologic toxicity (except Grade 3 alopecia, injection site  reaction, fatigue, 
or grade 3-4 lab values related to und erlying baseline conditions ),  grade 1 
neuropathy with p ain or any toxicity that is deemed intol erable by the patient or 
investigator until symptoms resolve  to baseline.  Such patients can be re-treated 
with a  reduced dose  of bortezomib and/or  cyclophosph amide  as outlin ed above. 
Should the  Grade 3-4 toxicity recur after dose reduction, th at patient will be 
removed from stu dy.  If a grade 3-4 toxicity is based solely on laboratory 
abnormalities that are thought to be  clinically insignificant by the treating 
physician, the  lab values should be  discussed with the  principle investigator to 
decide if dose interruption or reduction is n ecessary.

The neurotoxicity-directed questionn aire (see Appendix F) is a useful tool for determining the 
presence and int ensity of neuropathic pain and/or  peripheral neuropathy from the  patient’s 
perspective.  Neuropathic symptoms are more prominent than abnormalities on the  clinical 
examination.  A fter the patient compl etes the neurotoxicity-directed questionnaire, the 
questionn aire should be  reviewed to assist with the  evaluation of  the onset and int ensity of 
peripheral neuropathy and oth er neurotoxicities that may possib ly require intervention or  dose 
modi fication. 
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC R ESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT 
13.1 Definitions 
Response  and progression of  disease will be  evaluated in this stu dy using  the international 
criteria proposed by the Cheson et al. (Cheson, Pfistner et al. 2007)  for patients with 
lymphom a, and the  Forth International Workshop  on Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulin emia 
(Dimop aulos et al, 2009)  for patients with Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulin emia..  Not e: 
Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using  the criteria provided below. The 
term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be  used because it does not p rovide 
addition al meaning or accuracy. 
 
13.1.1  Measurable disease 
Measurable lesions are defined as those  that can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension (longest diameter to be  recorded) as >20 mm with convention al 
techniqu es (PET, CT) or as >10 mm with spi ral CT scan.  All tumor 
measurements must be  recorded in millim eters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters). 
 
13.1.2  No n-measurable disease 
All oth er lesions (or sites of disease), including  small lesions (longest diameter 
<20 mm with convention al techniqu es or <10 mm using  spiral CT scan), are 
consid ered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptom eningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, in flammatory 
breast dis ease, abdomin al masses (not follow ed by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions 
are all non -measurable. 
 
13.1.3  Target Lesions 
All m easurable lesions up to a maximum of  six lesions representative of all 
involv ed organs should be  identified as target lesions and recorded and m easured 
at baseline.  Target lesions should be  selected on the basis of  their size 
(determining the product obtained from the  longest diameter of two p erpendicular 
measurements) and th eir suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by 
imaging techniques or clinically). 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14) 
Amended: 07/25/12   
  
13.1.4  No n-target lesions 
All oth er lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be  recorded at baseline.  Non -target lesions in clude measurable 
lesions th at exceed the  maximum numb ers per organ or total of all involv ed 
organs as well as non -measurable lesions.  M easurements of  these lesions are not 
required, but the  presence or absence of each should be  noted throughout follow - 
up. 
 
13.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All m easurements should  be taken and recorded in metric notation using  a ruler or calipers. 
All b aseline evaluations (CT, PET, sup erficial clinical lesion m easurements) should be 
performed as closely as possible  to the  beginning of treatment and never more than 6 w eeks 
before the beginning of the treatment.  A CT:CAP and PET should be  performed at baseline, 
restaging, and at end of  treatment.  Post treatment follow -up will be  performed with CT 
scans.  A CT:Neck shou ld be performed along with each scheduled CT:CAP if the patient 
has a history of disease in the  neck. Tumor  lesions that are situated in a  previous ly irradiated 
area are consid ered measurable. 
 
The same method of  assessment and the  same technique  should be  used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and du ring follow - up.  Imaging-based evaluation 
is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination wh en both m ethods h ave been used to 
assess the  antitumor  effect of a treatment. 
 
13.2.1  Cli nical lesions.  Clinical lesions will on ly be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin  nodul es and palpable lymph nod es).  In the  case of skin 
lesions, do cumentation by  color photog raphy, including  a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended. 
 
13.2.2  C hest x-ray.  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions  when 
they are clearly defined and su rround ed by aerated lung.  Ho wever, CT is 
preferable. 
 
13.2.3  Co nventional CT  and MRI.  These techniqu es should be  performed with cuts of  
10 mm or  less in sli ce thickness contiguous ly.  Spiral CT should be  performed 
using  a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  This applies to tumo rs of the 
chest, abdom en, and pelvis.  H ead and neck tumo rs and those  of extremities 
usually require specific protocols. 
 
13.2.4  Ul trasound (US).  When the  primary endpoint of  the study is obj ective response 
evaluation, US  should not be used to m easure tumor lesions.  It is, ho wever, a 
possible  alternative to clinical measurements of  superficial palpable lymph nodes, 
subcutaneous l esions, and thyroid nodul es.  US  might also be  useful to confirm 
the compl ete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical 
examination.

IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14) 
Amended: 07/25/12   
  
13.2.5  Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of  these techniqu es for objective 
tumor  evaluation h as not yet been fully and wi dely validated.  Th eir uses in this 
specific context require sophisti cated equipm ent and a high level of expertise that 
may only be available in some  centers.  Therefore, the utilization of  such 
techniqu es for objective tumor  response  should be  restricted to v alidation 
purposes in reference centers. How ever, such techniques may be useful to confirm 
compl ete pathological response  when biopsi es are obtained. 
 
13.2.6  Tumor markers.  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess respons e.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limi t, they must no rmalize for a 
patient to be  consid ered in compl ete clinical respons e.  For patients with low - 
grade lymphom as, quantification and monito ring of any pre-existing  mono clonal 
gammop athy (via serum protein electrophoresis) and Beta-2-microglobulin  will 
be follow ed if there is an abnormal baseline value. 
 
13.2.7  Cy tology, His tology.  These techniqu es can be used to di fferentiate between 
partial respons es (PR) and compl ete respons es (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual 
lesions wh ere known  residual benign tumo rs can remain). 
 
13.2.7.1  The cytological confirmation of  the neoplastic origin of any effusion th at 
appears or worsens du ring treatment wh en the  measurable tumor  has met 
criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate 
between response  or stable disease (an effusion m ay be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive  disease. 
 
13.3 Response Criteria 
 
13.3.1  R esponse Criteria for patients with NHL  
Response  criteria are determined through evaluation of  target lesions.  Response  criteria 
for patients with N HL will follow the  guidelines previous ly reported by Cheson et al., 
2007 (Cheson, Pfistner et al. 2007)  and are described below.  The  criteria for NHL are as 
follows (GTD =  Greatest Transverse Diameter; SPD = Sum of  the Products of the 
Greatest Diameter): 
 
13.3.1.1  C omplete Remission  (CR): 
  Disappearance of all evidence of disease. 
  No dis ease related symptoms.  
  Lymph nod es, nodal masses regressed to “normal” size: 
o If >1.5 cm before treatment, regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in GTD.  
o If 1.1 to 1.5  cm before treatment, regressed to ≤ 1  cm in GTD (or >75% in 
SPD). If PET scan was positive  before therapy, a post-treatment residual 
mass of any size is permitted as long  as it is PET n egative. PET is 
consid ered negative if target lesions all have uptake values below the  level 
of average uptake in the  liver.

  Spleen and all previous ly enlarged organs decreased to no rmal in si ze. 
  If the Bone marrow was involv ed prior to treatment, it is clear on repeat 
aspirate and biop sy at the same site. 
 
13.3.1.2  Partial R emission  (PR): 
  ≥ 50%  decrease in SPD of six largest domin ant nod es/nod al masses. 
  No in crease in size of other nodes, liv er or spleen. 
  Splenic and hepatic nodes regressed at least 50%  in SPD 
  No n ew sites of disease. 
  If the PET scan was positive  before therapy, the post-treatment PET is 
positive  in at least one  previous ly involv ed site. 
  Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria, but who h ave persistent bone 
marrow involv ement (or those  in whom p re-treatment bone  marrow was 
involv ed and post -treatment bone  marrow involv ement was not assessed). 
 
13.3.1.3  R elapsed Disease (RD): 
  In patients previous ly CR : 
  New lesion >  1.5 cm in any axis 
  Size of previous ly involv ed site  has increase ≥ 50% in GTD.  
  ≥ 50%  increase in either: 
o GTD of  any previous ly identified node  that was >1 cm in its sho rt axis, or  
o SPD of any node or other lesion.  
 
13.3.1.4  Stable Disease (SD): 
  Patients who h ave achieved less than a partial remission but who h ave not 
developed findings consistent with p rogressive  disease. 
 
13.3.1.5  Progressive  Disease (PD): 
  In patients previous ly PR or SD. 
  ≥ 50%  increase from nadir or baseline in SPD or any node  or lesion 
  ≥ 50%  increase from nadir in GTD of  any node previous ly >1cm in sho rtest 
diameter 
  Appearance of any new lesion du ring or at the end of therapy. 
 
13.3.1.6  Evaluation of non-target lesions 
 
13.3.1.6.1  Complete Response (CR*): Disappearance of all non - 
target lesions and no rmalization of  any tumor  markers (i.e. 
IgM levels in WM).  Any post-treatment masses still 
present that were PET p ositive  prior to treatment must be 
PET n egative at the completion of  therapy.

13.3.1.6.2  Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of 
one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or  maintenance of 
tumor  marker level above the normal limits  
 
13.3.1.6.3  Progressive  Disease (PD):  App earance of one or more 
new lesions and/or  unequivocal progression of  existing 
non-target lesions  
 
***Althou gh a clear progression of  “non-target” lesions on ly is exception al, 
in such circumst ances the opinion of  the treating physician should p revail, and 
the progression st atus should be  confirmed at a later time by the review panel 
(or study chair).*** 
 
*Note:  If tumor  markers (i.e. IgM levels in WM) are initially above the upper 
normal limit, th ey must normalize for a patient to be consid ered in compl ete 
clinical respons e. 
 
13.3.2R esponse Criteria for patients with Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia 
 
The response  criteria used for patients with Waldenström’s Macroglobulin emia (WM) 
in this stu dy are the criteria from the  Forth International Workshop on Waldenström’s 
Macroglobulin emia (Dimopaulos, et al 2009 ).  These specific criteria are defined 
below: 
 
13.3.2.1  C omplete Response (CR): 
  Disappearance of mono clonal protein by immuno fixation. 
  No histolo gic evidence of bone  marrow involv ement. 
  Resolution of  any adenopathy/organomegaly (confirmed by CT scan). 
  Resolution of  any signs or symptoms attributable to WM. 
  Reconfirmation of  the CR status is required at least 6 w eeks apart with a 
second immuno fixation. 
 
13.3.2.2  Partial R esponse (PR): 
  At least 50%  reduction of  serum mono clonal IgM concentration on p rotein 
electropho resis. 
  At least 50%  decrease in adenopathy/organomegaly on physical examination 
or on CT scan. 
  No n ew symptoms or  signs of  active disease. 
13.3.2.3  Minor Response (MR): 
  At least 25%  but less than 50%  reduction of  serum mono clonal IgM by 
protein electrophoresis. 
  No n ew symptoms or  signs of  active disease.

13.3.2.4  Stable Disease (SD): 
  A less-than-25% reduction and less-than-25% increase of serum mono clonal 
IgM by electrophoresis without p rogression of  adenopathy/organomegaly, 
cytopenias, or clinically significant symptoms due  to dis ease and/or  signs of 
WM. 
 
13.3.2.5  Progressive  Disease (SD): 
  At least 25%  increase in serum mono clonal IgM by protein electrophoresis 
confirmed by a second measurement or progression of  clinically significant 
findin gs due  to dis ease (ie, anemia, thrombo cytopenia, leukop enia, bulky 
adenopathy/organomegaly) or symptoms (unexplained recurrent fever of at 
least 38.4° C, drenching night sw eats, at least 10%  body weight loss, or 
hyperviscosity, neuropathy, symptom atic cryoglobulin emia, or amyloidos is) 
attributable to WM. 
 
13.4 Evaluation of the best overall response 
 
The best overall response  is the  best response  recorded from the  start of the treatment until 
disease progression/ recurrence (taking as reference for progressive  disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).

Note: Patients with a  global deterioration of  their health status requiring discontinu ation of 
treatment without obj ective evidence of disease progression at that time  should be

In some  circumst ances, it m ay be difficult to distin guish residual disease from no rmal 
tissue.  When the  evaluation of  compl ete response depends on this d etermination, it is 
recomm ended that the residual lesion be  investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before 
confirming  the compl ete response  status. 
 
13.5  D uration of response 
 
13.5.1  D uration of overall response 
The duration of  overall response  is measured from the  time measurement criteria 
are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the  first date that 
recurrent or progressive  disease is obj ectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive  disease the smallest measurements recorded sin ce the treatment 
started). 
 
The duration of  overall CR is measured from the  time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the  first date that recurrent dis ease is obj ectively 
documented.  If stem cell transplant is pl anned after achieving CR, these patients 
will be  censored at the time of beginning  the preparative regimen for transplant. 
 
13.5.2  D uration of stable disease 
Stable disease is measured from the  start of the treatment until the  criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded sin ce 
the treatment started. 
 
13.5.3  Progression-Free Survival  
Mean and m edian durations of  respons e, progression-free survival, event-free 
survival and ov erall survival will be  calculated from the  observed stu dy durations. 
If the study evaluation is  performed before all data have reached their respective 
end-points, right-censored data for all duration estimates will be  treated as 
independent censoring and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates will be  employed. 
Time-to-progression analyses will t reat patient withd rawals and int erventions for 
reasons oth er than progression or  death as independent censoring. If stem cell 
transplant is pl anned after achieving a respons e, these patients will be  censored at 
the time of beginning  the preparative regimen for transplant. 
 
13.5.4  Time to progression  is defined as the start of treatment to the  first do cumented 
progression or  death. 
 
13.5.5  Event free survival is defined as the time of enrollment to the  first documented 
event, with events defined as: death, relapse, progressive  disease, secondary 
malignancy, or toxicity attributed to th erapy and requiring removal from stu dy. 
 
13.5.6  Time to death is defined from of  the start of treatment to the  date of death.

14.0 CRITERIA FOR R EMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Termination of  Treatment and/or  Study Participation 
 
Patients must be  informed that they have the right to withd raw from the  study at any time for 
any reason, without p rejudice to their medical care.  The  investigator also has the right to 
withd raw, and in some  cases is required to withd raw patients from the  study. 
 
The investigator or Millennium Pharmacovigilance may discontinue  the clinical research 
study if they determine  that the study or treatment offers little  or no future benefit, or the 
supply of medication ceases to be  available, or other causes prevent contin uation of  the 
clinical research study. If at any time the treating physician feels that continuing in the  study 
is not b eneficial for a given patient, or  if a patient is un able to follow the  treatment plan, 
treatment may be stopp ed. If there is progression  of disease despite this th erapy, it will be 
stopp ed.  If the investigator is in doubt as to wh ether progression h as occurred, particularly 
with respect to non t arget lesions and the  appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to 
continue  treatment for up to one  addition al cycle until formal evaluation of  response  has been 
compl eted. Ev ery effort should be  made to compl ete this evaluation b efore the end of  the next 
cycle. 
 
15.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
15.1  Study Design/Endpoints 
For the weekly schedule, the MTD dos es of bortezomib (1.8 m g/m2) and cyclophosp hamide 
(1000 m g/m2) will be  brought forward to the  phase II portion.  For the twice-weekly 
schedule, the 1.3 mg/m2 dose of bortezomib will be  used.  Each treatment arm will be 
evaluated separately.  The study will employ a Simon two st age design in the analysis of  the 
Phase II portion in each arm separately. For indol ent lympho mas and M CL, a 60% response 
rate is consid ered promising, whereas, a 40% is considered not p romisin g. Assuming  Type I 
and Type II errors are 0.10 and 0.20 respectively, then 17 p atients will be  accrued to the  first 
stage of each arm. If 7 or fewer patients in either treatment arm respond, no  addition al 
patients will be  enrolled in th at treatment arm and the regimen will be  considered not 
promising  in this cohort of patients. If 8 or more patients respond in either treatment arm, 
then an addition al 13 p atients (for a total of 30) will be enrolled in th at arm. 
 
We will use  the “pick the  winn er” format based on the randomi zed phase II clinical trials 
approach proposed by Simon et al.(Simon, Wittes et al. 1985 ).  If both regimens are 
efficacious without si gnificant differences in to xicity, then we plan to pi ck the winn er as 
follows:  If the numb er of patients who respond in  one arm is at least 16 and it exceeds by at 
least 1 p atient the  numb er of responders in the  other arm, th en the arm with  the higher 
response  rate (RR) would be declared the  winner. If neither arm had at least 16 respons es, the 
regimens in both arms would be  consid ered unworthy of further evaluation. No formal 
statistical comparison b etween the  two arms is pl anned. 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14) 
Amended: 07/25/12   
  
Upon compl etion of  the trial, if objective respons es are observed in 16 p atients or  more in 
either arm, this n ew regimen will be  declared to have promising activity. Based on this two 
stage design, the  probability of compl eting the trial and declaring the new regimen effective 
is 80%  when the  true response  rate is at least 60%  Althou gh this s ample  size will not allow 
for statistical comparisons between arms, di fferences between the  arms (such as toxicity or 
convenience, in addition to respons e) may generate hypotheses that can be tested in future 
studies. 
 
15.2  Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
Approximately 1 to 2 patients will be  accrued per month.  It is expected that the duration of  the 
entire study should be  approximately 30-60 months. 60 p atients tot al will t ake part in Phase II of 
this stu dy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, The  Cancer Institute  of New Jersey, 
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Columbia  Univ ersity Medical Center, and the  Winship 
Cancer Institute  at Emo ry Univ ersity. About 42 patients are expected to be  treated at MSKCC; 
the remainder will be  accrued by the subsit es. 
 
15.3  Stratification Factors 
Patients will be  randomi zed between the  twice-weekly and w eekly bortezomib t reatment 
schedules at the time of enrollment. Each treatment arm will be  analyzed ind ependently from 
the other. As su ch, each treatment arm will accrue patients following  the Simon two st age 
design. 
 
15.4  A nalysis of  Secondary Endp oints 
The following  secondary endpoints will also be  investigated in the  phase II portion of  
the trial: 
 
15.4.1  Progression -free survival, mean and m edian durations of  respons e, event-free 
survival, and ov erall survival will be  calculated from the  observed durations. The 
Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated. 
 
15.4.2  The primary safety endpoint is to d etermine  toxicity based on NCI Common 
Terminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The  frequencies of 
toxicities will be  tabulated for each arm separately. 
 
15.5  R eporting and Exclusions 
 
 
15.5.1  Evaluation of toxicity.  All p atients will be  assessable for toxicity from the time 
of their first treatment with bo rtezomib.  Patients who do not receive at least one 
dose of bortezomib will be  excluded from this analysis and replaced. 
 
15.5.2  Evaluation of response. All patients who m eet eligibility criteria and are 
included in the  study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviations or  if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be 
assigned one of the following  categories:  (1) complete respons e, (2) partial

respons e, (3) stable disease, (4) progressive  disease, (5) early death from 
malignant dis ease, (6) early death from to xicity, (7) early death because of other 
cause, or (9) unknown  (not assessable, insu fficient data). 
 
15.5.3  An in correct treatment schedule or drug administ ration do es not result in 
exclusion from the  analysis of  the response  rate. 
 
All conclusions should be  based on all eligible patients except as outlin ed above.  Sub- 
analyses may then be performed on the  basis of  a subset of patients, excluding  those  for

16.0 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION PROC EDUR ES 
 
16.1 Research Participant Registration 
 
Only individu als designated as consenting professionals on the  facesheet of this p rotocol 
may obtain patient informed consent. 
 
Confirm eligibility as defined in the  section entitled Criteria for Patient/Subject 
Eligibility. 
 
Obtain informed consent, by followi ng procedures defined in s ection entitled “Informed 
Consent Procedures.” 
 
During the registration p rocess registering indivi duals will be  required to compl ete a 
protocol specific Eligibility Checklist.  
All p articipants must be  registered through the  Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) 
Office at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.  PPR is available Mond ay through 
Friday from 8:30 am - 5:30pm at (646) 735-8000.  The PPR fax numb ers are (646) 735- 
0008 and  (646) 735-0003.  Registrations can be phoned in or  faxed by MSKCC staff 
only.  The  compl eted signature page of the written consent/verbal script and a compl eted 
Eligibility Checklist must be  faxed to PPR. 
 
Patient registration must be  initiated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center within 
48 hours of the patient signing the informed consent. 
 
 
 
16.1.1  For Participating Sites 
 
Central registration for this stu dy will t ake place at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Center (MSKCC). 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14) 
Amended: 07/25/12   
  
To compl ete registration and enroll a patient from another institution, the  study staff at 
that site must contact the designated research staff at MSKCC to noti fy him/h er of the 
participant registration. The  site staff then needs to fax registration/eligibility 
documents to the  Multicenter Trials Co re at MSKCC at 646-227-2482.  
 
The following  documents must be  sent for each enrollment within 24 hours of the 
informed consent being signed: 
• The compl eted or partially compl eted MSKCC eligibility checklist 
• The signed informed consent and signed HIPAA Autho rization form (Research 
Autho rization)  
• Suppo rting source documentation for eligibility questions (laboratory results, 
patholo gy report, radiology reports, MD not es, Physical exam sheets, m edical 
history, prior treatment records, and EKG report) 
 
Upon receipt, the  research staff at MSKCC will condu ct an interim review to confirm 
documents are received to compl ete registration. 
 
If the eligibility checklist is not compl ete, the patient will be  registered PENDING and 
the site is responsible  for sending a  compl eted form within 30 d ays of the consent. 
 
If the eligibility checklist is compl ete, the patient meets all criteria, all sou rce 
documentation is received, the  participating site IRB has granted approval for the 
protocol, and the  site is in good st anding with M SKCC, the MSKCC research staff will 
send the  compl eted registration do cuments to the  MSKCC Protocol Participant 
Registration (PPR) Office to be  enrolled as stated in section 16.1.  The  participant will 
be registered. 
 
Once eligibility has been established and the participant is registered, the  participant 
will be  assigned an MSKCC Clinical Research Database (CRDB) numb er (protocol 
participant numb er).  This numb er is unique  to the  participant and must be  written on 
all data and correspondence for the participant.  This protocol participant number will 
be relayed back to stu dy staff at the registering site via e-mail and will s erve as the 
enrollment confirmation. 
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF  HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Three copies of the MSKCC informed consent will be  signed and dated by the patient or the 
patient’s legally authorized representative, and by the physician obtaining  informed consent 
before drug will be  administered. Physicians qualified to obt ain informed consent are the 
Investigators listed on the  cover page of the protocol. One  copy will be  given to the  patient, one 
copy will be  filed in the  patient's medical record, and one  copy will be  retained in the  Protocol 
Participant Registration O ffice, Office of Clinical Research.

17.3 A dverse events, regulatory and reporting requirements 
 
17.3.1  Definitions 
 
Adverse Event definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
administ ered a pharmaceutical product, whi ch does not n ecessarily have a causal 
relationship with the  treatment.  An adverse event can be any unfavorable and 
unint ended sign (eg, including  an abnormal laboratory finding ), symptom,  or 
disease temporally associated with the  use of the drug, whether or not it is 
consid ered to be  drug related.  This in cludes any newly occurring event or 
previous condition th at has increased in s everity or frequency since the 
administ ration of  drug. 
 
Serious Adv erse Event definition  
 
A Serious Adverse (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that: 
 Results in d eath. 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14) 
Amended: 07/25/12   
  
 Is life-threatening.  Life-threatening means that the patient was at imm ediate 
risk of  death from the  reaction as it occurred, ie, it do es not in clude a reaction 
which hypothetically might h ave caused death had it occurred in a more 
severe form. 
 Requires inpatient hospit alization or  prolongation of existing  hospit alization. 
Hospit al admissions and/or  surgical operations s cheduled to o ccur during the 
study period but pl anned prior to stu dy entry are not consid ered AEs if  the 
illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the  trial, provided 
that it did not d eteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (eg, 
surgery performed earlier than planned). 
 Results in p ersistent or significant dis ability/incapacity.  Disability is defined 
as a subst antial disruption of  a persons’ ability to condu ct normal life 
functions.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Is an impo rtant medical event.  An impo rtant medical event is an event that 
may not result in d eath, be life-threatening, or require hospit alization but m ay 
be consid ered an SAE when, based upon  appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and m ay require medical or surgical 
intervention to p revent one of the outcomes listed in the  definitions for 
SAEs.  E xamples of such medical events in clude allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive  treatment in an emergency room or  at hom e, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions th at do not result in inp atient hospit alization, or  the 
developm ent of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Clarification should be  made between the  terms “serious”  and “severe” since they are not 
synonymous.  The  term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a 
specific event (as in mild, mod erate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event its elf, 
however, may be of relatively minor  medical significance (such as a severe headache). 
This is not the  same as “serious,”  which is b ased on patient/event out come or action 
criteria described above  and are usually associated with events th at pose  a threat to a 
patient’s life or functionin g.  A severe adverse event do es not n ecessarily need to be 
consid ered serious.  For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration m ay be 
consid ered severe nausea but not an SAE.  On the  other hand, a  stroke resulting in on ly a 
minor  degree of disability  may be consid ered mild, but would be  defined as an SAE 
based on the  above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting oblig ations.  
 
17.3.2 Procedures for AE and SAE reporting 
 
17.3.2.1     It is the  responsibili ty of the principal investigator and his/h er research 
team to id entify, review and report all necessary adverse events to the  institution al 
IRB, Mill ennium Pharmacovigilance and governmental agencies (i.e., NCI and/or 
FDA) as appropriate. Adverse events should be  identified through standard, 
routine  protocol review and clinical assessment of each subj ect participating in the  
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14) 
Amended: 07/25/12   
  
clinical trial. This review should be  timely in order to meet the requirements for 
adverse event reporting defined below. All un expected or serious adverse events 
(SAE), regardless of the type of research study, phase or sponsor  must be  reported 
to the  MSKCC IRB (see section 19.2 ). 
17.3.2.2  All serious adverse events (SAEs) (regardless of expectedness, causality, and 
whether commercial or investigational bortezomib is used) must be reported to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance.  See Section 19.3.5 for the reporting of SAEs. The 
spons or-investigator is responsible to meet all regulations and requirements applicable to 
the sponsor-investigator. 
 
17.3.3  Millennium Reporting Guidelines 
Adverse events (AEs) may be  spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response  to an open 
question from study personnel or revealed by observation, ph ysical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures.  AEs which are serious must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance from first dose 
of bortezomib up to and including 30 da ys after administration of the last dose of bortezomib. 
 
When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common unde rlying pathology shou ld be noted as 
one comprehensive event. Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of bortezomib treatment 
or after the designated follow-up pe riod that the investigator and/or sub-investigator considers to be 
related to any study drug must be reported to the Millennium Pharmacovigilance.  Planned ho spital 
admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed before the patient was enrolled 
in the trial are not to be considered AEs unless the condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner 
during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed ea rlier or later than planned). All SAEs should be 
monitored until they are resolved or  are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic 
cond ition or  intercurrent illness(es). 
 
This is an investigator-initiated study.  The principal investigator, Dr. John Gerecitano, M D, PhD, 
(who may also so metimes be referred to as the spons or-investigator), is conducting the study and 
acting as the sponsor. Therefore, the legal/ethical obligations of the principal investigator include both 
those of a sponsor and those of an investigator. 
Sponso r-investigator must report all SAEs, regardless of expectedness or relationship with any  study 
drug, to Millennium Pharmacovigilance as soon as possible, but no later than 5 calendar  days of the 
spons or-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.   For  external sites, the sponsor- 
investigator is responsible to ens ure that the SAE reports are sent to Millennium Pharmacovigilance 
from all sites participating in the study. Subinvestigators must report all SAEs to the sponsor- 
investigator so that the sponsor-investigator can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the sponsor-investigator and 
subinvestigator(s). Millennium Pharmacovigilance may request follow-up information to a reported 
SAE, which the sponsor-investigator will be responsible for providing to Millennium 
Pharmacovigilance. 
 
The SAE report must include event term(s), serious criteria, and the sponsor-investigator’s or sub- 
investigator’s determination of both the intensity of the event(s) and the relationship of the event(s) to 
study drug administration. 
 
Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined by  using the NCI CTCAE, 
version 4.0, as a guideline, whenever possible. The criteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.

IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14) 
Amended: 07/25/12   
  
 
Relationship to all study drugs for each S AE will be determined by  the sponsor-investigator or sub- 
investigator by respon ding yes or no to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is 
associated with the study drug(s)? 
 
Sponso r-investigator must also provide Millennium Pharmacovigilance with a copy of all 
communications with applicable regulatory authorities related to the study or study drug(s), including, 
but not limited to, telepho ne conversation logs, as soon as possible but no later than 5 c alendar days of 
such communication.

18.2 Quality Ass urance 
Registration reports will be  generated to monitor  patient accruals and completeness of 
registration d ata.  Routine  data quality reports will be  generated to assess missing  data and 
inconsist encies.  A ccrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow -up will be 
monito red periodically throughout the  study period and pot ential problems will be  brought to 
the attention of  the study team for discussion and action. 
 
Random -sample  data quality and protocol compli ance audits will be  condu cted by the study 
team, at a minimum of  once a year or more frequently if indicated. 
 
18.2.1 Q uality Ass urance for Participating Sites 
 
Each site participating in the accrual of participants to this protocol will be audited by the 
staff of the MSKCC study  team for protocol and regulatory compli ance, data verification 
and source documentation.  Audits  may be accomplished in one of two ways: (1) selected 
participant records can be audited on-site at participating sites or (2) source documents 
for selected participants will be sent to MSKCC for audit. Audits will usually be 
determined by participant accrual numb ers and rate of accrual, but can also be prompt ed 
by reported SAEs or  request of MSKCC PI. 
 
Audits  will be condu cted at least once shortly after initiation of participant recruitment at 
a site, annually during the study (or more frequently if indicated), and at the end or 
closeout of the trial. The numb er of participants audited will be determined by available 
time and the  compl exity of the protocol. 
 
The audit will in clude a review of source documentation to evaluate compliance for: 
 
• Informed consent do cuments and procedures 
• Adherence to eligibility criteria 
• Protocol defined treatment 
• Required baseline, on st udy and follow -up protocol testing  
• IRB documents (submitt ed amendments, annual continuing  review reports, SAEs)  
• Required specimen sub mission  
• Pharmacy review, if applicable 
• Case Report Form submissions to M SKCC: timing and accuracy 
 
A wrap-up session will be  condu cted at the participating site and prelimin ary findin gs 
will be  discussed with the  participating site PI and research team. The  prelimin ary results 
will be  sent to the  MSKCC PI. 
 
Each audit will be  summ arized and a final report will be  sent to the  PI at the audited 
participating site within 30 d ays of the audit. The  report will in clude a summary of 
findin gs, participant by participant case review, specific recomm endations  on any 
performance and/or  shortcomin gs and request for corrective action, wh en necessary.

18.2.2  Da ta and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center were approved by the National Cancer Institute in September 2001.  The  plans 
address the  new poli cies set forth by the NCI in the  document entitled “Policy of the 
National Cancer Institute  for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be 
found at:  http:// cancertrials.nci.nih. gov/researchers/dsm/ind ex.html.   The  DSM Plans at 
MSKCC were established and are monito red by the Office of Clinical Research.  The 
MSKCC Data and Safety Monito ring Plans can be found on the  MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb2.ms kcc.org/irb/ind ex.htm 
 
There are several different mechanisms by which clinical trials are monito red for data, 
safety and quality.  There are institution al processes in pl ace for quality assurance (e.g., 
protocol monito ring, compliance and data verification audits, th erapeutic respons e, and 
staff education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, 
plus th ere are two institution al committ ees that are responsible  for monito ring the 
activities of our clinical trials programs.  The  committees: Data and Saf ety Monitoring 
Committ ee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the  Data and Saf ety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the  Center’s Research Council and 
Institution al Review Board. 
 
During the protocol developm ent and review process, each protocol will be  assessed for 
its level of risk and degree of monito ring required.  Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH 
sponso red, in-house  sponsored, indust rial sponso red, NCI cooperative group, etc.) Will 
be addressed and the  monitoring procedures will be  established at the time of protocol 
activation. 
 
18.2.3  R esponse Review 
 
Since therapeutic efficacy is a stated primary objective, all sites patient’s respons es are 
subject to review by MSKCC’s Therapeutic Response Review Committ ee (TRRC ). 
Radiolo gy, addition al lab reports and possib ly bone marrow biopsi es and/or  aspirates 
will n eed to be  obtained from the  participating sites for MSKCC TRRC review and 
confirmation of  response  assessment. Th ese materials must be  sent to M SKCC prompt ly 
upon request.

Continuing Review Approval 
The Continuing  Review Approval letter from the  participating site’s IRB and the  most  
current approved version of the informed consent form should be  submitt ed to M SKCC 
within 7 days of expiration. Failure to submit the  re-approval in the  stated timeline will 
result in susp ension of  study activities. 
 
Deviations and Viola tions 
A protocol deviation on this stu dy is defined as a request to t reat a research participant 
who do es not m eet all the  eligibility criteria, pretreatment evaluation, or  who requires 
alteration in th eir study plan. If a deviation from this p rotocol is p roposed for a potential 
or existing  participant at MSKCC or a participating site, approval from the  MSKCC 
IRB/PB is required prior to the  action. Participating sites should contact the MSKCC PI 
who will in tu rn seek approval from the  MSKCC IRB/PB. 
 
A protocol viol ation is anything that occurs with a  participant, whi ch deviated from the 
protocol without p rior approval from the  MSKCC IRB/PB. For protocol violations th at 
are identified after they occur, the participating site should report to M SKCC as soon as 
possibl e. The  MSKCC PI will in tu rn report the violation to the  MSKCC IRB/PB. 
 
Participating sites should  report deviations and vi olations to th eir institu tion’s IRBs as 
soon as possible  per that site’s institution al guidelines. App rovals/acknowl edgments from 
the participating site IRB for protocol deviations and viol ations should be  submitt ed to 
MSKCC as received. 
 
Other correspondence 
Participating sites should  submit oth er correspondence to their institution ’s IRB 
according to local guidelines, and submit copies of that correspondence to MSKCC. 
 
Document maintenance 
The MSKCC PI and the  Participating Site PI will maintain adequate and accurate records 
to enable the implementation of  the protocol to be  fully documented and the  data to be 
subsequently verified. 
 
The participating sites will ensure that all participating site IRB correspond ence (IRB 
approval letters referencing protocol version d ate and amendment numb er, IRB approved 
protocol, appendices, informed consent forms, d eviations, viol ations, and approval of 
continuing  reviews) is maintained in the  regulatory binder on site  and sent to M SKCC. 
 
A regulatory binder for each site  will also be  maintained at MSKCC; this b inder may be 
paper or electronic.

good clinical practice and protocol guidelines. 
 
Signed copies of the informed consent should be  distributed as follows: One  copy will be 
given to the  participant to be retained for their personal records. One copy will be 
maintained on file at the MSKCC. The  third copy will be  confidentially maintained by 
the participating institut ion. 
 
A note  will be  placed in the medical record documenting  that informed consent was 
obtained for this stu dy, and th at the participant acknowl edges the risk of  participation. 
 
21.0 CORR ELATIVE STUDIES 
 
 
 
21.1 Tissue Microarray: Pretreatment paraffin-embedded histolo gic samples will be  obtained 
from all MSKCC patients, wh en possibl e. TMA blocks will be  subjected to 
immunohisto chemical staining  targeting cell markers that will give insight into biolo gical 
features predicted to relate to prognosis or  response to treatment. TMA st aining will be 
correlated with t reatment outcome in each patient. We will th en look for trends th at 
would sug gest baseline biological characteristics that correlate with ultim ate response  to 
bortezomib t reatment. This correlative study will not require the harvesting of any 
addition al tissue  samples from the  patients enrolled. Participating outside  sites will not be 
asked to p artake in these correlative studi es. 
 
21.2 DNA Sequencing, real-time PCR, a nd Gene Expression  Studies: Funding  is being 
sought for genetic studi es.  On ce funding is obt ained the  informed consent will be  revised 
to request patient permission for fine needle aspirate.  DNA  and RNA will be  isolated

genes in dis ease pathogenesis and response  to the  treatment protocol. Genomic DNA will 
be subjected to s equencing to detect mut ations and loss of  heterozygosity, and to real- 
time PCR to detect gene amplifications and deletions. RNA will be  used to generate 
cDNA th rough RT-PCR for analysis of  gene expression. Samples for these studies will 
require addition al FNA procedures but will not require any addition al biopsy procedures 
than wh at’s outlin ed in the  other sections. Patients who p articipate will und ergo 2 FNA 
procedures. Both will be  Research Non-Billable and funded by Geoffrey A. Beene

APPENDIX C:  Body Surface Area and Creatinine Clearance Calculations 
 
 
 
Body surface area (BSA) should be  calculated using a standard nom ogram that yields the 
following  results in m eters squ ared (m2): 
 
 
BSA = Ht(inche s) ×Wt(lbs) 
3131  
 
or 
 
 
BSA =  
 
Ht (cm) ×Wt(kg ) 
3600  
 
 
 
Creatinine  clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation as follows: 
CrCl (ml/min)  = (140-age) (actual wt in kg) 
72 x serum creatinine  (mg/dl) 
For females use  85% of calculated CrCl value. 
Note: In markedly obese patients, the  Cockroft-Gault formula  will t end to ov erestimate 
the creatinine  clearance. (Adipose  tissue  tends to contribute  little creatinine requiring 
renal clearance.)

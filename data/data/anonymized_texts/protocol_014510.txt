Study Title  
Lessening Incontinence through Low-impact Activity (LILA) , a.k.a. Yoga to Enhance 
Behavioral Self-Management of Urinary Incontinence in Women 
 
Objectives  
To develop and test procedures for a future full-scale efficacy trial of a group-based 
yoga therapy intervention in m iddle-aged and older women with u rinary incontinence.  
Design   
Pilot, randomized, parallel-group trial of a group-based yoga therapy program versus 
physical conditioning control program for treatment of urinary incontinence in 
ambulatory middle-aged and older women. 
Sample Size and Population  
Up to ninety women aged 50 years and older who document stress- , urgency-, or 
mixed-type incontinence occurring an average of once per day on  a voiding diary, 
are not participating in other organized yoga activities, are n ot using other clinical 
treatments for incontinence, and meet minimum mobility and othe r eligibility criteria 
will be recruited from the general San Francisco Bay Area.   
Interventions and Duration 
Eligible women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to participate in either a 12-week 
yoga therapy program (N~45) or a time-equivalent physical condi tioning exercise 
control program (N~45).  Women randomized in the yoga therapy p rogram will take 
part in twice weekly group yoga classes focusing on selected Iyengar-based yoga 
techniques as well as practice study-specific yoga techniques a t home for at least 
one hour per week for a total of 12 weeks.  Women randomized to  the physical 
conditioning control group will take part in twice weekly group physical conditioning 
classes and practice physical conditioning exercises at least o ne hour per week at 
home for 12 weeks.   
Outcomes and Measurements 
To assess feasibility, rates of enrollment and retention will be carefully monitored, 
and adherence yoga or stretching practice will be assessed during the 12-week intervention as well as 12 weeks after the end of the intervent ion programs.  To 
collect preliminary data on treatment efficacy for urinary incontinence, validated 3-day voiding diaries will be used to document changes in the fre quency of 
incontinence over 12 weeks of treatment, as well as persistence  of changes 12 
weeks after the end of the intervention programs.  To collect p reliminary data on 
treatment efficacy for other symptom and quality-of-life outcom es, validated self-
administered questionnaires will also be used to examine change s in other urinary 
tract symptoms, condition-specific quality of life, and anxiety  and perceived stress 
over 12 weeks of treatment, as well as persistence of changes12 weeks after the end of the intervention programs.   
  
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 7 of 52 Version 2.3  
  1. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 
Aim 1:  To examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining ambulatory women aged 
50 years and older into a randomized trial of a yoga therapy ve rsus physical 
conditioning program for treatment of incontinence, and explore potential differences 
in retention and adherence by duration of treatment and follow- up.   
Expected outcome 1: We expect to recruit and randomize 15 to 30  women in each 3-month 
enrollment wave to confirm our ability to assemble a class size of 8 to 15 women per group 
per wave in a future full-scale trial. 
Expected outcome 2:  We expect drop-out rates in both treatment  groups to increase over 
time, but remain <20% after 12 weeks of treatment and <30% at 1 2 weeks of post-treatment 
follow-up. 
Expected outcome 3: We expect adherence to decrease over time, but remain >75% at 12 
weeks of treatment (for group classes and home practice) and >5 0% at 12 weeks post-
treatment (for home practice only). 
Aim 2:  Explore whether a clinically meaningful reduction in in continence frequency 
could be detected in a full-scale trial of yoga versus physical conditioning, and 
examine potential differences in treatment efficacy by duration  of treatment and 
follow-up.   
Expected outcome 1: We will collect data on the standard deviat ion, intra-class correlation, 
and between-group difference in change in incontinence frequenc y to guide sample size 
projections for a future full-scale trial powered to detect a 25% greater reduction in 
incontinence frequency associated with yoga therapy. 
Expected outcome 2: We will examine time-related trends in treatment effects on 
incontinence frequency to guide expectations of treatment effic acy over 8 versus 12 weeks 
of treatment as well as persistence of treatment benefits after 12 weeks of post-treatment 
follow-up in a future full-scale trial. 
Aim 3:  Explore potential effects of yoga versus physical conditioning on other 
symptom and quality-of-life outcomes associated with incontinen ce and examine 
potential differences in treatment efficacy by duration of treatment and follow-up.   
Expected outcome 1: We will collect data on standard deviations , intra-class correlations, 
and between-group differences for changes in anxiety, depression, and quality-of-life 
questionnaire scores to guide estimates of minimum detectable e ffects for these secondary 
outcomes in a future full-scale trial. 
Expected outcome 2: We will examine time-related trends in treatment effects on these 
secondary outcomes to guide expectations of treatment efficacy over 8 versus 12 weeks as 
well as persistence of benefits after 12 weeks of post-treatment follow-up in a future full-
scale trial.  
2.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Background on Condition 
Approximately one in four middle-aged and older women suffer fr om urinary 
incontinence, a condition associated with depression, social is olation, functional 
decline, falls and fractures, and admission to long-term care f acilities.1-8  In economic 
analyses, the annual estimated direct costs of incontinence amo ng U.S. women 
exceed $20 billion, greater than that of breast, ovarian, cervi cal, and uterine cancers 
combined.9 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 8 of 52 Version 2.3  
  Current first-line treatment for both stress- and urgency-type incontinence includes 
behavioral management strategies such as bladder re-training and pelvic floor 
exercises to increase bladder capacity, strengthen the muscles supporting the bladder 
neck, and suppress involuntary bladder contractions. Unfortunat ely, many patients 
who attempt to practice these techniques after routine teaching  by general 
practitioners are not able to do so effectively.10-13  Although the efficacy of these 
techniques can be improved by in-depth, one-on-one training and  biofeedback with 
pelvic physical therapists or other specialized medical practit ioners, this type of 
intensive pelvic floor rehabilitation therapy is costly, and access to trained pelvic 
physical therapists in the community is limited.14,15   
Second-line treatment for urgency-type incontinence (i.e., leak age caused by a sudden 
urge to void) consists primarily of anticholinergic drugs that are modestly effective in 
reducing incontinence, but have multiple side effects such as d ry mouth, stomach 
upset, constipation, and cognitive impairment.  As a result, over half of patients who initiate anticholinergic therapy discontinue it within a year.
16-18  For stress-type 
incontinence (i.e., leakage with activities that increase abdom inal pressure), surgery 
and other invasive procedures can be effective, but are inappro priate or poorly 
tolerated by many patients, es pecially older women who are at g reatest risk of 
incontinence.19  There is a need for alternate therapies that that are not onl y effective, 
but also more accessible and better tolerated. 
2.2 Study Rationale 
Yoga is a complementary behavioral intervention with the potent ial to improve 
incontinence through multiple mechanisms, while avoiding the shortcomings of existing therapies. When taught in a way that emphasizes mindful awareness of speci fic bodily 
structures, yoga can be used to help women control and strengthen their pelvic floor muscles through group instruction and home practice. As a resul t, a group-based yoga 
program that incorporates practice of specific yoga postures to promote awareness and engagement of the pelvic floor may provide a more accessibl e alternative to 
traditional, one-on-one pelvic floor rehabilitation therapy, provided that it can be taught in a standardized way that is appropriate for patients’ clinica l and safety needs.   
Yoga can also alleviate anxiety, stress, and associated autonom ic imbalance, as 
factors that contribute to incontinence and magnify its impact on quality of life. Clinical 
studies indicate that women with high self-reported levels anxi ety or stress are at 
increased risk of developing incontinence, and that women with chronic incontinence 
experience worsening of their incontinence after exposure to st ress-inciting events.
20-27  
Although cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy, and other types of 
psychotherapy have been explored as potential treatments for in continence,28-31 these 
strategies are again limited by the need for intensive, one-on- one sessions with mental 
health specialists.  In contrast, a group-based yoga program th at promotes relaxation 
through deep breathing and other restorative techniques may pro vide a more 
generalizable, community-based strategy for women to decrease a nxiety and stress32-
36 in order to improve both bladder control and quality of life. 
To examine the feasibility o f using yoga to treat incontinence in middle-aged and older 
women, our research team previously developed a group-based, Iyengar-style yoga therapy program consisting of twic e weekly classes and once weekly home practice 
sessions. In a pilot trial involving 19 ambulatory middle-aged and older women with at least 7 episodes of urgency, stress, or mixed-type incontinence per week, women 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 9 of 52 Version 2.3  
  randomized to this therapeutic yoga program experienced a 70% d ecrease in 
incontinence frequency over 6 weeks, versus 16% for the waitlist control (P=.05), 
without any increase in adverse events.37   
We now plan to conduct an R34-scale pilot study to develop, tes t, and refine 
procedures for a more rigorous, full-scale efficacy trial of yo ga for treatment of 
incontinence in middle-aged and older women. Information collec ted during this pilot 
trial will allow the research team to evaluate and strengthen p rocedures for recruiting, 
randomizing, and retaining participants for a future efficacy t rial, as well as collect 
more preliminary data on the potential efficacy of the study in terventions on clinical 
and quality-of-life outcomes. 
3.  STUDY DESIGN 
The LILA study is a pilot randomized parallel-group trial of a group-based yoga therapy 
program versus physical conditioni ng control program for treatment of urinary incontinence 
in ambulatory middle-aged and older women. Women aged 50 years and older who document at least 3 episodes of stress-, urgency-, or mixed-typ e incontinence on a 
screening 3-day voiding diary, are not using other clinical tre atments for incontinence, and 
meet minimum physical mobility requirements and other eligibility criteria will be recruited from the general San Francisco Bay Area by research coordinators based at the University of California San Francisco. Eligible women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to participate in 
either a 12-week yoga therapy program (N~45) focusing on select ed Iyengar-based yoga 
techniques, or a time-equivalent physical conditioning exercise  control program (N~45).  
Women randomized in the yoga t herapy program will take part in twice weekly group yoga 
classes involving 8 to 15 other women as well as practice study -specific yoga techniques at 
home for at least one hour per week for a total of 12 weeks.  W omen randomized to the 
physical conditioning control group will take part in twice wee kly group physical conditioning 
classes and practice physical conditioning exercises at least o ne hour per week at home for 
12 weeks.  During a 12-week post-treatment follow-up period, pa rticipants will also be 
encouraged to continue practicing yoga or stretching exercises for at least an hour per 
week. 
To address aim 1, the study team will carefully track the progress of recruitment and 
randomization and monitor participants’ adherence to group clas ses and home practice over 
12 weeks of yoga or stretching training as well as 12 weeks aft er the end of the training 
programs. To address aim 2, validated voiding diaries will be used to document changes in the frequency of urinary incontinence over 12 weeks of yoga or stretching training as well as 
persistence of changes 12 weeks after the end of the training programs. To address aim 3, 
validated questionnaires will be used to examine changes in anx iety and perceived stress 
symptoms and condition-specific quality of life over 12 weeks of yoga or stretching training 
as well as persistence of changes 12 weeks after the end of the  training programs.   
4.  SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS

4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Recruitment:  Participants will be recruited from the greater S an Francisco Bay area 
using a multi-component approach that has been employed successfully in past 
clinical trials led by the investigators. This includes community-based media efforts 
(newspaper and radio advertisements, notices posted in communit y and senior 
centers, mass community mailings), recruitment from a database of women who 
have given permission to be contacted for women’s health resear ch studies based at 
the University of California San Francisco, and posting of recruitment fliers in clinician offices (such as general internal medicine, geriatric s, gynecology, or 
alternative medicine).   
Recruitment will be organized in waves to assemble successive c ohorts of women 
who are confirmed to meet all eligibility criteria and who are available to attend 
upcoming group yoga or physical conditioning classes. Based on past experience, 
the investigators assume that three waves will be needed to recruit and randomize at 60 eligible participants, with up to three months of recruitmen t required per wave, 
and 15 to 20 eligible women randomized in each wave. This will allow for a minimum 
of ~8 women taking part in each class series in each interventi on group. 
Screening: Preliminary eligibility will be determined by resear ch coordinators through 
a Screening Telephone Interview followed by an in-person Screen ing Clinic Visit.  
During the Screening Telephone Interview, coordinators will fol low a standardized 
screening interview script to assess preliminary eligibility re lated to age, gender, 
incontinence history, and exclusionary conditions and medications and document reasons for ineligibility on the screening interview form (see section 6.2.3, Screening 
Procedures, for more detail). Candidates who appear preliminari ly eligible at the end 
of the screening telephone interview will be scheduled to atten d an in-person 
Screening Clinic Visit. After providing written informed consen t at this visit, women 
will undergo more detailed assessment of incontinence symptoms,  use of clinical 
incontinence therapies, exclusionary medical conditions, exclus ionary medications, 
urine dipstick and pregnancy testing (for women of childbearing  potential), and brief 
physical function assessment (s ee description of study procedur es below), with 
reasons for eligibility or ineligibility documented on the scre ening clinic intake form.   
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 12 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  At the end of the Screening Clinic Visit, women who appear elig ible will be given a 
blank voiding diary and instructions for completing it at home over a 3-day period and 
returning it to study staff at a Baseline Clinic Visit. Those w ho are confirmed to have 
stress-predominant, urgency-predominant, or mixed urgency-stres s incontinence 
occurring at least 3 times over the 3-day diary period and meet  all other 
inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Baseline Clinic Visit will be considered eligible for 
randomization to one of the two intervention groups. 
Randomization: During each recruitment/randomization wave, elig ible women will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two intervention groups. Randomization will 
be stratified by clinical type of incontinence (i.e., stress, u rgency, or mixed), to 
ensure adequacy of randomization within these three types. Randomization will be implemented by computer algorithm using randomly permuted block s of sizes 2 and 
4, with proof of eligibility required before assignment. To avo id manipulation, 
standard allocation concealment procedures will be followed (see section 6.2.4. on Randomization for more detail).   
To avoid excessive lag time between randomization and the start  of the yoga therapy 
or physical conditioning programs, randomization will take place within two weeks of 
the yoga or physical conditioning program orientation session. For candidates whose 
Baseline Clinic Visit falls within this two-week window, random ization will take place 
directly at the Baseline Clinic Visit. For candidates who complete their Baseline Clinic Visit more than two weeks before the start of the yoga or physi cal conditioning 
intervention programs, a Randomization Telephone Call will be s cheduled to 
complete randomization within the two-week window. 
5.  STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Yoga Therapy Program  
Overview and rationale: The 12-week yoga therapy program will provide instruction 
and practice in a variety of yoga postures and techniques that have been selected by the study yoga expert consultants for their potential to improv e bladder control and 
safety and feasibility for the target population. The study wil l feature a therapeutic 
program based primarily on Iy engar yoga, a form of Hatha yoga that is known for its 
potential therapeutic applications, has been employed successfully in other studies of yoga for different indications,
32,34,38-44 and differs from other Hatha yoga styles 
(power yoga, bikram yoga) in multiple ways that are likely to m aximize both efficacy 
and safety for this study. These include: 1) emphasis on precis e anatomical and 
postural alignment during practice of yoga postures; 2) incorpo ration of props to 
minimize risk of injury and accommodate those with lower streng th or flexibility; 3) 
emphasis on mindful awareness during practice of postures rathe r than rapid cycling 
through postures. The resulting yoga program, which was pre-tested and refined in the investigators’ pilot LILY trial,
37 is designed to maximize women’s awareness of 
and control over the pelvic floor and improve underlying stress  and anxiety, while still 
being feasible for ambulatory women across a wide range of ages , as well as 
grounded in techniques common to Iyengar yoga at large.  
Content and postures: The study yoga program will focus on a core set of 14 
postures that are widely used in yoga practice, have been pre-t ested in the 
investigators’ earlier pilot study, and can be safely adapted f or ambulatory women of 
all ages, including those with moderately decreased flexibility  or mobility. These 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 13 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  include both active postures engaging the pelvic floor and more  passive postures 
promoting relaxation: Baddha Konasana (bounded angle pose), Bharadvajasana 
(seated twist pose), Malasana (squat pose), Parsvokonasana (sid e angle pose), 
Parsvottasana (intense side stretch pose), Salabhasana (locust pose), Savasana 
(corpse pose), Salamba Set Bandhasana (supported bridge pose), Supta Baddha 
Konasana (reclined cobbler’s pose), Utkatasana (chair pose), Su pta 
Padagushthasana (reclined big toe pose), Tadasana (mountain pos e), Trikonasana 
(triangle pose), Viparita Karani Variation (legs up the wall po se), and Virabhadrasana 
2 (warrior 2 pose). 
Staff qualifications and training: Each yoga therapy class seri es will be led by a 
primary instructor who will: 1) have at least 2 years of experi ence teaching yoga in 
the community; 2) review a detailed, study-specific written ins tructor manual 
describing all of the postures and yoga techniques to be used i n the study program; 
3) complete at least 2 hours of in-person training in study-specific techniques with 
one of the study yoga expert consultants (Leslie Howard or Judith Lasater); 4) complete study-specific training in documentation of participan t attendance, review of 
home practice logs, and recording of yoga postures practiced du ring group classes 
on appropriate study forms; 5) carry and submit proof of person al liability insurance 
(minimum of $2 million coverage); and 6) confirm his or her wil lingness to adhere to 
the study intervention procedures. To maximize the generalizability of the study results and minimize observed effects due to specific providers , different primary 
instructors will be sought for each yoga class series. For each  class series, a back-
up instructor will also be identified who can teach a class in the event that the 
primary instructor is ill or is unable to teach due to an emergency. 
Orientation and classes:  Prior to group instruction, participa nts in each class series 
will attend a 90-minute group orientation led by an appointed c lass instructor. This 
will include an overview of the general principles of Iyengar yoga, an orientation to 
the structures of the pelvis, spine, and lower extremity, and a n introduction to the 
yoga postures and the props to be used in the study. After the orientation, women 
will attend 90-minute group classes twice weekly for 12 weeks, led by the same instructor as well as an assistant to provide personalized attention to students. During group classes with an expected size of 8 to 15 participa nts, the instructor will 
guide women in practicing yoga postures, calling attention to w ays in which postures 
can improve pelvic floor function and adapt postures to accommo date physical 
limitations. Women will also be taught to avoid habits that may  worsen incontinence 
during practice, such as squeezing of abdominal rather than pel vic muscles. 
Following a study-specific guide, instructors will gradually introduce postures as classes progress, with the goal of making participants comforta ble with all core 
postures by the end of 8 weeks and fully confident in performing postures by 12 weeks. 
Home practice: In addition to attending group classes, particip ants will be asked to 
practice yoga at home at least one additional time per week and  will be given a diary 
to keep track of the dates and times of practice.  Women will a lso be given a written 
manual, pre-tested in the pilot LILY study,37 that includes pictures and descriptions of 
each yoga posture to guide them in home practice. Each particip ant will be given a 
limited set of yoga props (a mat, belt, and 2 blocks) for home practice.  Women will 
be encouraged to practice with other members of their classes, but will be 
discouraged from practicing with individuals who are not in the ir class and from 
taking part in non-study yoga activities that might dilute study techniques. After the 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 14 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  end of the main 12-week study period, participants will be encouraged to continue 
practice yoga at least one hour per week at home, although they  will not continue to 
attend study-specific group classes. 
Quality and safety: The study program will incorporate multiple  modifications to help 
women across the age range to perform postures in ways that min imize risk of 
muscle strain or injury. Participant manuals will include speci fic instructions on 
adapting each posture and/or using props to accommodate problem s with mobility, 
flexibility, or balance. To promote quality and safety, the ins tructors leading classes 
will be required to have at least 2 years of experience teachin g yoga and have 
completed dedicated, study-specific training with the study’s e xpert consultants. 
Following procedures established in the pilot study, a consulta nt will visit at least one 
class in each series to ensure that postures are being taught a ccording to protocol, 
evaluate students’ success in learning yoga, and ensure fidelit y across instructors.  
Monthly conference calls will be conducted to help instructors trouble-shoot issues 
that arise in instruction. 
5.2 Physical Conditioning Control Program  
Overview and rationale: This tr ial will include a 12-week physi cal conditioning 
program that will provide a rigorous time-and-attention control for the yoga program, 
but has been designed to avoid engaging the pelvic floor or pro moting mindful 
relaxation. To minimize differential expectations of treatment success, women will be told that they are enrolling in a study of two different types of low-impact physical activity-based interventions (y oga versus physical conditioning ) to enhance 
management of incontinence. Physica l conditioning exercises hav e been adapted 
from exercises used in prior studies conducted by the investiga tors, such as the 
PRYSMS trial of restorative yoga vs. stretching for metabolic s yndrome (designed by 
Sarah Pawlowsky, DPT, consultant on this proposal), in which pa rticipants 
maintained good adherence to the stretching program despite a l ong study period.  
Similar to postures in the yoga  therapy program, the exercises in the physical 
conditioning program have been selected for their potential to be performed safely by 
women across a range of ages and flexibility levels. 
Content and exercises:  After a brief education about sitting a nd standing posture, 
the physical conditioning program will focus on a core set of stretching/strengthening 
exercises that will be performed sitting in a chair: levator sc apulae, upper trapezius, 
scalenes, shoulder horizontal adduction, triceps, pectoral stretch with hands behind head, wrist flexors and extensors, trunk flexion, trunk extensi on, trunk side-bend, 
trunk rotation, and hamstring stretches.  Additional chair exercises will incorporate a stretching strap: pectoral stretch with strap, gastrocnemius st retch with strap, and 
hand behind back with strap.  A few stretches will be performed  on an exercise mat 
on the floor: supine single knee to chest, supine hamstrings st retch with strap, 
quadriceps stretch with strap, supine shoulder flexion with str etch strap, and seated 
adductor stretch. Three exercises will be performed in the standing position: gastrocnemius, soleus, shoulder flexion, and shoulder abduction stretches. 
Staff qualifications and training: Each physical conditioning class series will be led by 
a primary instructor who: 1) is either certified as a personal trainer through the 
National Academy of Sports Medicine or the American College of Sports Medicine, 
or licensed as a physical therapist by the Physical Therapy Boa rd of California; 2) 
has at least 2 years of experience working as a physical therapist or physical trainer in either individual or group settings; 3) will have reviewed a  detailed, study-specific 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 15 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  training manual describing all of the stretching/strengthening exercises to be used in 
the study program; 4) will have completed at least 2 hours of i n-person training in 
study-specific techniques with study expert consultant Sarah Pawlowsky, DPT; 5) will have completed study-specific training in documentation of participant attendance, review of home practice logs (for adherence), and recording of exercises performed 
during group classes on appropriate study forms; 6) carries and  submits proof of 
personal liability insurance (minimum of $2 million coverage); 7) confirms his or her 
willingness to adhere to the study intervention procedures. To maximize the 
generalizability of the study results and minimize observed eff ects due to specific 
providers, different primary instructors will be sought for eac h class series. For each 
class series, a back-up instructor will also be identified who can teach a class in the 
event that the primary instructor is ill or is unable to teach due to an emergency. 
Group orientation and classes: S imilar to the yoga therapy prog ram, the physical 
conditioning program will begin with a group orientation led by a physical therapist or trainer and an assistant, who will provide an overview of the s tretching/strengthening 
exercises to be covered in the program. This will be followed b y 90-minute twice 
weekly group classes, each with 8 to 15 participants, led by th e same therapist and 
assistant, who will have received in-person study-specific training from consultant 
Sarah Pawlowsky, DPT. Classes will be designed to make women co mfortable with 
all stretching/strengthening exercises by 8 weeks and fully confident in performing 
exercises by 12 weeks. 
Home practice: In addition to attending group classes, women wi ll be asked to 
perform stretching/strengthening exercises at home at least one additional time per 
week and record the dates and times of practice in a log. Women will receive a 
detailed manual with pictures and descriptions of each stretchi ng/strengthening 
exercise to guide them in home practice, as well as a stretch s trap and exercise mat 
to use at home. After the end of the main 12-week study period,  participants will be 
encouraged to continue practice stretching/strengthening exercises at least one hour 
per week at home, although they will not continue to attend study-specific group classes. 
Quality and safety:  Instructors leading physical conditioning classes will be physical 
therapists or trainers who have at least 2 years of experience working with adults of 
a range of ages and have completed dedicated in-person training  with Sarah 
Pawlowsky, DPT.  Dr. Pawlowsky  will provide quality monitoring and assess 
women’s success in learning stretching/strengthening exercises by making an in-
person visit to at least one class in each series. She will als o lead monthly 
conference calls with instructors, similar to quality monitoring for the yoga program.  
5.3 Concomitant Interventions  
5.3.1 Required Interventions 
Participants in both intervention groups will also receive a pa mphlet at the 
Baseline Clinic Visit that provides basic patient-directed information about 
first-line behavioral self-management of incontinence, including pelvic muscle 
exercises, timed urination, and urge suppression. This pamphlet  is consistent 
with usual care of incontinence in the general community, and h as been used 
in previous studies of experimental treatments for incontinence conducted by the investigators.
45 Since information about behavioral self-management of 
incontinence is available from  multiple websites and public res ources, 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 16 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  systematic provision of this information will help avoid differ ential use of self-
management techniques between treatment groups, and will also r eflect 
expected concomitant use of these techniques with yoga in clini cal practice.  
Participants will be queried about use of these techniques at b aseline, at the 
8-week and 12-week clinic visits, and as part of the 24-week as sessment, so 
that information about co-interventions can be incorporated into data 
analyses if appropriate. 
5.3.2 Prohibited Interventions 
Participants will be asked to refrain from using other clinical  treatments for 
incontinence during the 12-week intervention period as well as the 12-week post-treatment follow-up period. These include medications with  the potential 
to affect incontinence symptoms (anticholinergic bladder medica tions, 
selective norepipherine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepr essants, 
mirabegron), invasive or surgical bladder treatments, medical d evices used to 
improve bladder symptoms (e.g., pessary), and behavioral treatm ent 
programs administered by certified practitioners (e.g., pelvic floor 
rehabilitation therapy, biofeedback programs). Additionally, participants will be asked to refrain from starting or changing the dosage of medications that could affect anxiety and perceived stress symptoms (e.g., antid epressants, 
sedatives/hypnotics, or antipsychotic agents), although mainten ance of stable 
dosages of these medications will be acceptable. 
Participants will be queried about use of these prohibited inte rventions at 
baseline, at the 8-week and 12-week clinic visits, and as part of the 24-week 
assessment. If participants are found to be using prohibited interventions, 
they will not be required to terminate the study early, but study staff will also 
re-urge participants to avoid using prohibited interventions if at all possible 
(although this may not be possible for some types of interventi ons), and 
information about use of prohibited interventions can be taken into account in 
data analyses. 
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Adherence to group yoga and physical conditioning classes will be documented by the study class instructors using standardized attendance logs.  Attendance logs will 
be returned to clinical coordinators on at least a weekly basis  throughout the yoga 
therapy and physical conditioning programs. Clinical coordinato rs will immediately 
contact any participant who misses a scheduled class to ask abo ut reasons for 
missing the class, reinforce the importance of class attendance, and troubleshoot any barriers to attendance. 
Adherence to home practice of yoga or stretching/strengthening exercises will be 
tracked using home practice logs. Participants will be instructed to record the date, 
time, and duration of each home practice session in their logs,  as well as the specific 
yoga poses or stretching/strengthening exercises practiced during each session.  
Home practice logs will be collected by class instructions and returned to the clinical 
coordinators on a weekly basis during the 12-week treatment pro gram. Clinical 
coordinators will contact any participant whose log indicates that she is not practicing yoga or stretching exercises a t least one hour a week at home. Additionally, home 
practice logs will be returned by mail 12 weeks after the end o f the intervention 
program to assess home practice during the post-treatment follo w-up period. 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 17 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  Every effort will be made to encourage participants to complete all intervention 
classes and practice sessions. Prior to randomization, study co ordinators will stress 
the importance of adherence to group classes and home practice,  and only those 
women who indicate that they are available on scheduled class d ates and willing to 
practice yoga or stretching exercises at home as recommended wi ll be eligible for 
randomization. The importance of adherence will again be stressed at the orientation session for each yoga or physical conditioning series, as well as during follow-up 
telephone calls 2 weeks and follow-up visits at 8 weeks. Additionally, attendance 
sheets from yoga and stretching classes will be carefully monitored, and home 
practice logs will be reviewed weekly, so that study staff can immediately call any 
women who miss classes or fail to document home practice in order to reinforce the importance of attendance/practice and troubleshoot barriers to adherence. 
6.  STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Study Measures 
6.1.1  Urinary Incontinence 
The primary efficacy outcome, frequency of any urinary incontinence, will be assessed using a 3-day voiding diary that has been shown to be a valid and 
reliable method for documenting change in incontinence symptoms  and is 
widely used in clinical trials of incontinence treatments.
46,47  At 
screening/baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 12 weeks after the e nd of the 
yoga and physical conditioning programs (24 weeks), each partic ipant will 
receive written instructions and a blank diary to take home, and will use the diary to record all voiding and incontinence episodes over a 3- day period and 
classify incontinence episodes b y clinical type (urgency, stres s, other). Upon 
return of the diary, an analyst will abstract data to determine  the number of 
total as well as urgency and stress incontinence episodes per d ay. For diaries 
that are completed after randomization, data will be abstracted  by an analyst 
who is blinded to treatment assignment. 
6.1.2  Condition-Specific Quality of Life  
To address incontinence-related quality of life, participants will complete the following validated questionnaire measures at baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks, as well as 12 after the end of the yoga and physical conditioning 
programs (24 weeks): 
A. Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ)-- a validated, 28-item measure of 
the impact of incontinence on 4 domains of functioning and qual ity of life 
(physical activity, emotional health, relationships, and travel ).
48,49 Scores 
range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate worse impact.  
B.  Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 (UDI-6)-- a validated, 6-it em measure that 
assesses subjective distress from frequent urination, urgency incontinence, stress incontinence, small-volume leakage, diffic ulty 
emptying the bladder, and genital pain.
49 Scores are scaled from 0 to 100. 
C. Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC)-- a validated  single-item 
measure assessing the degree to which respondents consider thei r 
condition to be a problem on a 6-point scale.50,51 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 18 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  6.1.3  Anxiety and Perceived Stress  
To evaluate anxiety and perceived stress symptoms that may be associated 
with incontinence, participants will complete the following val idated 
questionnaire measures at screening/baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 w eeks, as 
well as 12 weeks after the end of the yoga and physical conditioning programs (24 weeks): A. Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): Somatic an xiety (i.e., the 
affective component of anxiety believed to be related to autonomic physiological arousal response) will be measured using the trai t 
component of the STAI, a 20-item self-administered measure vali dated in 
clinical populations, including patients with bladder symptoms,  with scores 
ranging form 20 to 80.
52,53 
B. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS): Cognitive anxi ety (i.e., the 
mental component of anxiety associated with fear of failure) wi ll be 
measured by the HADS, a validated self-administered questionnaire that includes a 7-item Anxiety Subscale
54 shown to be sensitive to change in 
incontinence trials.55 Scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores 
indicating greater anxiety. 
C. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): Perceived stress will be asses sed by the 
PSS, a 10-item measure of thoughts and feelings related to perc eived 
stress in the past month, validated in a probability sample of the United States.
56 Scores range from 0 to 40; higher scores indicated greater 
stress. 
D. Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D): D epressive 
symptoms will be assessed by the CES-D, a 20-item measure that has 
been widely used in clinical trials, including bladder interven tions, and is 
sensitive to change.57 Total scores range from 0 to 60. 
6.1.4  Yoga/Physical Conditioning Self-efficacy and Competency  
A. Yoga Posture Self-Efficacy: At 8 weeks and 12 weeks, as well  12 weeks 
after the end of the yoga therapy program (24 weeks), women in the yoga 
group will complete a structured questionnaire (modeled after an existing 
self-efficacy measure 58 and pre-tested in the investigators’ previous pilot 
study) to indicate how confident they are that they can perform  each of the 
postures featured in the program (from ‘not at all’ to ‘extreme ly confident’). 
Total scores will range from 0 to 56, with higher scores indica ting greater 
confidence. A corresponding questionnaire will be administered to the 
physical conditioning group participants. 
B. Independent Yoga Competency Assessment: To provide a more ob jective 
assessment of women’s success i n learning yoga, a yoga expert 
consultant will attend one class at the end of each series and observe 
women as they practice yoga. The consultant will rate each woma n’s 
success in performing each yoga posture on a 5-point scale, ranging from “not at all” to “extremely” successful. Total scores will range from 0 to 56.  
In the physical conditioning control group, Sarah Pawlowsky, DP T, will 
provide similar assessments. 
C. Yoga Practice Adherence Self-Efficacy: At 8 weeks and 12 wee ks, as well 
12 weeks after the end of treatment (24 weeks), women will comp lete a 
measure of confidence in adhering to yoga or stretching practic e, modeled 
after existing physical activity adherence self-efficacy scales  
59 and tested 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 19 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  in the pilot study. Women will indicate on a 5-point scale how confident 
they are that they can practice yoga or stretching when they: 1) are tired, 
2) are in a bad mood, 3) have limited time, 4) are away from home, and 5) 
are not regularly attending yoga classes. Scores will range fro m 0 to 20. 
D. Credibility and Expectations of Treatment: To assess whether  women 
perceive the yoga and physical conditioning interventions as eq ually 
credible and have similar expecta tions for improvement in incon tinence, 
we will administer a modified version of an expectancy/credibil ity measure 
used in other women’s health studies at baseline.60 
6.1.5  Additional Screening and Covariate Measures  
The following data will be collected to assess eligibility, ass ess whether 
treatment groups are comparable at baseline, and guide statisti cal adjustments 
in the event groups are not balanced: A. Demographic history including date of birth, gender/sex, rac e/ethnicity, 
education history, employment his tory, marital status (screenin g/baseline) 
B. Urologic/urogynecologic history including age of onset of in continence, past 
and current treatment of incontinence, history of pelvic surger y, history of 
pregnancy and delivery, menstrual/menopausal status (screening/ baseline) 
C. General medical history including general health assessed by  the CDC 
Healthy Days module,
61 selected medical conditions associated with 
incontinence such as diabetes, and current medication use (screening/baseline and 12 weeks) 
D. Health-related habits such as tobacco/alcohol use, prior yoga experience, 
prior group-based physical activity instruction, physical activ ity level by the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire
62,63 (screening/baseline) 
E. Sleep quality assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality In dex (PSQI),39,40 a 
validated questionnaire evaluating sleep quality, latency, effi ciency, and 
problems (screening/baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks) 
F. Physical exam measures inc luding measured height, weight, heart rate, and 
blood pressure (screening/baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks) 
G. Physical function including self-reported function using the  PROMIS Adult 
Physical Function Profile short-form.64 Participants will also undergo direct 
physical mobility evaluation using the Short Physical Performan ce Battery65 
(screening/baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks). 
6.2 Evaluations  
6.2.1 Screening Evaluations 
Screening evaluations will be conducted by study coordinators based at 
outpatient facilities at 2330 Post Street on the Mt. Zion campu s of UCSF, 
which contain all equipment needed for screening assessments.  Screening 
procedures will include a brief preliminary Screening Telephone  Interview, 
followed by an in-person Screening Clinic Visit, completion of a 3-day voiding diary at home, and review of the diary at an in-person Baseline Clinic Visit. All 
screening procedures must be completed within a 90-day period i n order for 
participants to be eligible for randomization.  If screening pr ocedures cannot 
be completed within 90 days, initial screening procedures must be repeated 
to ensure that participant eligibility has not changed prior to randomization. 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 20 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  6.2.2   Consenting Procedure 
Prior to administration of any data collection instruments, sig ned consent will 
be obtained by a research coordinator at the beginning of the S creening 
Clinic Visit. A single informed consent process will be used th at will cover 
both the screening and post-randomization procedures. All parti cipants must 
be able to read and understand the consent form in English and must provide 
written informed consent before enrolling in the study. Following the UCSF 
IRB-approved template (see Appendix A), the consent form will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures involved in recruiting, randomized, and 
monitoring participants, and the potential risks and benefits a ssociated with 
participation. A study coordinator will first explain the study  procedures to the 
potential participant, referring as necessary to the detailed I RB-approved 
consent form. The coordinator will then give a paper copy of the consent form 
to the potential participant to read. After the potential participant has read the 
consent form, she will be asked if she has any questions or concerns about 
the study. Once these questions/concerns have been addressed, t he 
participant will be asked to sign the consent form, and will be  given a copy of 
the consent form to take home for future reference. Coordinators will also have each participant read and sign a HIPAA authorization form granting 
study staff permission to access protected health information if needed. Pursuant to California Health & Safety Code 24172, each participant will also receive a copy of the Experimental Subject's Bill of Rights. A copy of the 
signed consent form and HIPAA authorization form will be stored  in the 
participants’ chart in locked research offices.  
6.2.3   Screening Procedures 
Telephone Screening Interview 
 Women who call in response to recruitment advertisements or wh o have 
previously given permission to be contacted about opportunities to 
participate in women’s health research at UCSF will be provided  with a 
brief overview of the study goals and procedures by a clinical coordinator 
over the telephone. 
 If interested, candidates will complete a brief telephone survey to assess 
preliminary eligibility (including age, gender, duration/freque ncy/type of 
incontinence, current and past incontinence treatment, prior yo ga practice, 
physical mobility, exclusionary conditions and medications, availability for 
upcoming yoga therapy or physical conditioning classes). 
 
Screening Clinic Visit 
 At this visit, a clinical coordinator will explain the require ments of the study 
while referring to the detailed informed consent form, and candidates will 
provide written informed consent if they are still interested i n proceeding 
with the study. 
 Candidates will complete questionnaires about their demographi c, 
urologic/urogynecologic, and medical history to determine if th ey meet 
criteria related to age, gender, duration/frequency/type of inc ontinence, 
current and past incontinence treatment, prior yoga practice, e xclusionary 
conditions and medications 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 21 of 52 Version 2. 3 
   Over-the-counter and prescription medications will be reviewed to 
determine if candidates are taking any exclusionary medications . 
 Height, weight, and resting blood pressure and pulse measureme nts will 
be obtained. 
 Physical function will be assessed by questionnaire. 
 A clean-catch urine sample will be collected to assess for pos sible urinary 
tract infection and rule out pregnancy (for the minority of can didates who 
are still of child-bearing potential).   
 Potentially eligible women will be instructed on completing a 3-day voiding 
diary to document all incontinence and voiding episodes at home . 
 A Baseline Clinic Visit will be scheduled at least 3 days late r for review of 
the completed voiding diary and determination of final eligibil ity. 
 
Baseline Clinic Visit 
 Candidates will return with the completed 3-day voiding diary,  and results 
will be reviewed by a clinical coordinator. Candidates whose di aries 
indicate predominantly urgency, stress, or mixed-type incontine nce, 
document at least 3 incontinence episodes per 3-day diary, and meet all other eligibility criteria will be eligible to continue.   
 Women will complete structured questionnaires about anxiety an d 
perceived stress, incontinence-specific quality of life, and sl eep quality.   
 Physical function will be assesse d by direct physical mobility  evaluation. 
 Participants will be given a brief written pamphlet about usua l first-line 
behavioral management of incontinence (see description in inter ventions 
section above).  
 If the Baseline Clinic Visit takes place within 2 weeks of the start of the 
yoga or physical conditioning program orientation session, elig ible 
participants will be randomized to one of the two interventions  at this visit. 
 If the Baseline Clinic Visit takes place more than 2 weeks bef ore the start 
of the yoga or physical conditi oning program, eligible particip ants will be 
scheduled for a Randomization Telephone Call within two weeks o f the 
start of the program to determine their intervention assignment. 
6.2.4 Randomization and Blinding 
Randomization 
Women who are confirmed to be eligible and available to take pa rt in 
upcoming yoga or physical conditioning group class series will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two intervention groups. Randomization will ideally 
take place within 1 month of completion of screening procedures, and in no 
cases will be able to take place more than 2 months after compl etion of 
screening procedures. Randomization must also take place within  2 weeks of 
the start of yoga or physical conditioning class series. If the  Baseline Clinic 
Visit occurs within 2 weeks of the start of the yoga therapy or  physical 
conditioning program, eligible participants will be randomized to one of the two interventions directly at this visit. If the Baseline Clinic Visit occurs more than 2 weeks before the start of the intervention program, eligible participants will be scheduled for a Randomization Telephone Call within two  weeks of 
the start of the program to determine their intervention assign ment. 
During the Baseline Clinic visit or during the Randomization Te lephone Call 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 22 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  (whichever is appropriate), randomization will be performed according to a 
pre-established computer-algorithm using randomly permuted blocks of sizes 
2 and 4 (limited block size to ensure that the number of random ized 
participants within each strata always exceeds the block size).   
Randomization will be stratified by clinical type of incontinence (i.e., stress, 
urgency, or mixed) to ensure adequacy of randomization among wo men with 
each major incontinence type. Randomization will be implemented . Prior to 
randomization, the research coordinator will complete a randomi zation 
checklist confirming that the participant meets all eligibility criteria. Additionally, participants’ availability and willingness to att end upcoming yoga 
or physical conditioning group classes will be re-confirmed before randomization assignment is obtained. 
Standard allocation concealment procedures will be followed to avoid 
manipulation of randomization.
66 Prior to the start of recruitment, the 
randomization scheme will be developed by a statistical program mer who will 
have no contact with participants or role in data entry, cleani ng, or analysis.  
To execute the randomization scheme, a research assistant who w ill also 
have no contact with participants or access to study data will then prepare a 
series of sealed, opaque envelopes containing group assignment, numbered 
consecutively with the randomization sequence numbers. When the  
participant is ready for randomization, study coordinators will enter the date, participant name, and study ID in the randomization log and select the next numbered envelope corresponding to the participants’ type of in continence 
(stress-, urgency-, or mixed-type) to determine group assignmen t. Once a 
participant has been randomized, she cannot be re-assigned to a  different 
intervention group. All randomization envelopes will be retaine d for review; 
randomization dates and times should follow the order of the se quence 
numbers, providing a check on validity.   
Blinding 
Although participants cannot be blinded to treatment assignment  (due to the 
behavioral nature of the intervention), study procedures have b een carefully 
designed to avoid bias associated with knowledge of group assig nment.  
First, to minimize differential expectations of treatment succe ss, participants 
will be told that they are participating in a study of two diff erent types of low-
impact group activity-based interventions to enhance self-manag ement of 
incontinence, and that we do not know which is more effective (which is true). 
The primary outcome will be assessed by voiding diaries, a meas ure that is 
resistant to reporting bias, and data from returned diaries will be abstracted by blinded analysts. Similarly, data from participant follow-up  questionnaires 
assessing other symptom and quality-of-life outcomes associated with incontinence will be abstracted by blinded analysts.   
Only study personnel who are involved in delivering the therape utic 
interventions, assessing and promoting adherence to these inter ventions, 
and/or monitoring adverse events related to these interventions  will be aware 
of group assignment. All investigators, study analysts involved  in abstracting 
efficacy outcomes data, and statistical programmers involved in  ongoing data 
cleaning will be blinded to treatment allocation. Unless stipulated by the Data 
and Safety Monitor or required to assist with the clinical mana gement of a 
participant experiencing a serious adverse event, these investi gators and 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 23 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  staff will remain blinded until after all participants have com pleted their final 
visit, trial data are edited and cleaned, and the trial dataset  is locked.  A 
statistical programmer who is not involved in data collection or cleaning will 
be appointed to create the unblinded group-specific data tables  for closed 
session Data and Safety Monitor reviews.   
6.2.5 Follow-up/Final Evaluations 
Follow-up evaluations will consist of a 2-week telephone call, 8-week clinic 
visit, 12-week clinic visit, and 24-week mail-in assessment: 
2-Week Telephone Call  
 Two weeks after the start of the yoga therapy or physical cond itioning 
program, coordinators will call women to assess adverse events, address 
any concerns, and reinforce adherence to group classes and home  
practice of yoga therapy or stretching/strengthening exercises.   
 Adherence to and challenges in performing usual behavioral sel f-
management strategies for incontinence will also be assessed.   
 Women will be reminded to continue recording home yoga or phys ical 
conditioning practice in their practice logs and return their l ogs each week 
to the yoga class instructors. They will also be reminded to st art filling out 
a second voiding diary 3 days before the 8-Week Clinic Visit. 
 
8-Week Clinic Visit

stretching/strengthening exercises for at least an hour per wee k for the 
next 12 weeks and record this practice in their home practice l ogs. 
 
24-Week Assessment 
 Approximately twelve weeks after completion of the yoga or phy sical 
conditioning program, coordinators will call participants to th em to 
complete their fourth and final voiding diary at home (the blan k diary will 
be mailed in advance to participants at home). 
 Adverse events will be assessed by telephone and recorded usin g 
standardized forms (see safety monitoring section). 
 Women will also be asked to complete questionnaires addressing  
symptom, quality-of life, and sleep outcomes as well as yoga/ph ysical 
conditioning practice adherence and self-efficacy at home (ques tionnaires 
will be mailed in advance to participants at home). 
 Women will also be asked to complete a close-out satisfaction 
questionnaire addressing their overall satisfaction with study procedures 
and change in incontinence symptoms. 
 Women will return with their final completed voiding diary and  
questionnaires using a pre-stamped and addressed envelope. 
 
Recommended time windows for completion each of the post-random ization 
follow-up evaluations will be as follows: 
Follow-Up Assessment Time Window 
2-week telephone call 11 to 17 days after the start of the yoga  therapy 
or physical conditioning program

conditioning program 
24-week telephone and mail-in assessment Within 189 days (27 weeks) of the start of the yoga therapy or physical conditioning program 
(allowing time for return of mail-in packet) 
6.2.6 Early Termination (also see section 8 below)  
If a randomized participant opts to terminate the study before the 12-Week 
Clinic Visit, or if the principal investigator in consultation with the Data and Safety Monitor determines that early termination is necessary t o protect the 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 25 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  safety of a participant, the study coordinator will encourage the participant to 
complete an early termination visit. This visit will include as  many of the 
procedures originally scheduled to take place at the 12-Week Cl inic Visit as 
possible, including: assessment of adverse events; re-administr ation of 
questionnaires about condition-specific quality of life, anxiet y/stress 
symptoms, yoga or physical conditioning self-efficacy; review of current medications; re-assessment of weight, blood pressure, and heart rate; re-assessment of physical function; and administration of a satisf action 
questionnaire. The participant’s reasons for terminating the st udy early will be 
explored and documented in her study file.

  7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
7.1 Potential Risks and Protective Measures 
Although participation in this study is not expected to place p articipants at substantial 
risk of harm, study procedures may be associated with the follo wing risks: 
 Yoga Therapy Intervention:  Possible risks associated with group yoga instruction 
and home yoga practice include muscle soreness and muscle/ligam ent strain, or 
other musculoskeletal injury if participants fall or lose their balance while trying to 
practice the yoga poses. 
 Physical Conditioning Control Intervention:  Similar to the yo ga therapy 
intervention, possible risks a ssociated with physical condition ing control 
intervention include muscle soreness and muscle/ligament strain , or 
musculoskeletal injury if participants fall or lose their balan ce while trying to learn 
or practice the exercises. 
 Questionnaires and Diaries: Although the information participa nts provide on 
data collection forms and diaries is confidential, some partici pants may feel 
embarrassed at having to answer questions, especially those related to incontinence symptoms or anxiety/stress symptoms.  However, los s of 
confidentiality is unlikely to pose any significant legal or fi nancial risk to 
participants. 
 Physical Examination/Performance Measurements:  There are no d irect risks 
associated with undergoing measurement of height, weight, blood  pressure, or 
heart rate, or evaluation of physical mobility, although partic ipants may 
experience this as inconvenient or unpleasant. 
 Behavioral Incontinence Self-Management Pamphlet:  Provision of standard 
written information on usual first-line behavioral self-managem ent strategies for 
incontinence such as pelvic floor muscle exercises and timed ur ination should 
pose no risks to participants, although participants may find it inconvenient or unpleasant to read the pamphlet. 
 Urine Dipstick and Pregnancy Testing: There are no direct risk s associated with 
collection of the screening urine sample, although some partici pants may 
experience this as inconvenient or unpleasant. 
To minimize potential risks to participants associated with stu dy interventions and 
procedures, the following steps will be taken: 
 Yoga Therapy Intervention.  The instructors leading the group yoga classes will 
be trained yoga teachers who will have experience in guiding adults from a wide 
range of ages to learn and practice yoga safely and will underg o specific, in-
person training by the study’s y oga expert consultants.  The st udy protocol 
incorporates props such as blocks and straps to help participan ts perform yoga 
postures in such a way that will minimize the chance of muscle strain or other injury.  The yoga instruction manuals have been designed to include explicit tips on modifying or adapting postures to accommodate problems with mobility, 
flexibility, or balance. 
 Physical Conditioning Control Intervention:  Instruction for t he physical 
conditioning control classes will be provided trained physical therapists or 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 28 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  personal trainers who are experienced in teaching patients of all ages to perform 
stretching and strengthening exercises safely, and who will have completed in-
person training with co-investigator Sarah Pawlowsky, PT.  
Stretching/strengthening exercises have been selected to be app ropriate for 
middle-aged and older women who may have flexibility or mobility limitations in addition to incontinence. 
 Questionnaires and Diaries. All study questionnaires and diari es will be stored in 
a locked file cabinet in a locked room in our research clinic, or on password-secured servers. All study staff are fully trained in good clin ical practice, HIPAA 
procedures, and the importance of participant confidentiality is emphasized. 
 Physical Examination/Perform ance Measures.  Study personnel re sponsibility for 
performing physical exam measures  and evaluating physical mobil ity will have 
prior clinical experience with performing physical exam measure ments in middle-
aged and older women and will receiving study-specific training to ensure that they perform measurements in a manner that is sensitive and min imizes 
discomfort to participants. 
 Urine Dipstick and Pregnancy Testing.  Study coordinators will  receive training 
on obtaining screening urine samples in a manner that is sensit ive and minimizes 
discomfort to participants. 
 Behavioral Incontinence Self-Management Pamphlet:  Study coord inators will be 
available to answer participants’ questions about the pamphlet if they arise. 
7.2 Methods and Timing of Safety Assessments 
To monitor participant safety, a clinical coordinator will asse ss for adverse events at 
each follow-up telephone and in-person contact following randomization, starting with the 2-Week Telephone Call. Negative changes in health will be recorded as adverse events or serious adverse event s on standardized forms as appropriate (see 
sections 7.3 and 7.4 below for definitions and documentation). Additionally, if 
participants contact clinical coordinators in between scheduled  study visits and calls 
and report negative changes in their health, these will also be recorded as adverse events or serious adverse events. 
Coordinators will not prompt participants to provide informatio n about specific types 
of adverse events at follow-up visits, but instead encourage participants to volunteer 
information by asking the standardized, open-ended question, “H ave there been any 
changes in your health since your  last visit?”  Any negative ch anges in health 
reported by participants will then be recorded on standardized AE or SAE forms, as 
appropriate (see section 7.3 below).   
7.3     Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events     
7.3.1  AE/SAE Definitions   
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in participant that 
occurs during the study or with use of the study interventions.  An adverse 
finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment, or an y 
combination of these. Medical conditions or diseases present be fore starting 
study interventions will only be considered adverse events if t hey worsen 
after starting the intervention. 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that results in death, a life-
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 29 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  threatening event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapac ity, a congenital 
anomaly or birth defect, or any other important medical event that jeopardizes the safety of participants based upon appropriate medical judgment. 
7.3.2  AE/SAE Documentation 
All negative changes in health reported by participants will be  recorded on 
standardized AE or SAE forms, as appropriate. Each adverse event will be assigned an AE number and will be recorded on a separate AE for m to avoid 
duplication in reporting. For each AE, clinical coordinators wi ll record the date 
of onset and resolution of the AE and record the nature or type  of AE.  Based 
on information provided by the participant, coordinators will a lso classify the 
severity of the AE as “mild” if it does not have a noticeable impact on the patient, “moderate” if it causes the patient some inconvenience , or “severe” if 
it results in substantial disruption to the patient’s functioni ng or well-being. In 
consultation with the principal investigator, coordinators will also indicate whether any indicate whether any specific action such as discontinuation of the study intervention was taken in response to the AE.   
Each serious adverse event will be assigned an SAE number and r ecorded 
on an SAE form.  Similar to regular AEs, clinical coordinators will record the 
date of onset and resolution of each SAE and record the nature or type of 
SAE. Coordinators will also document any treatment provided for  the SAE, 
indicate any laboratory or other clinical data obtained about t he SAE, indicate 
the participant’s condition at the time of reporting of the SAE , and indicate 
whether any specific action such as study discontinuation was taken in 
response to the SAE. Each SAE form will be reviewed and signed by the 
principal investigator, who will use a standard attribution scale to indicate the 
potential relationship between any SAEs and study interventions  (not, 
unlikely, possible, probably, or definitely related to study intervention). 
7.4 Reporting Procedures 
  7.4.1   SAE Reporting 
 Clinical coordinators will notify the principal investigator im mediately when 
a SAE is discovered, in addition to filling out a standardized SAE form 
that will be reviewed and signed by the principal investigator (see section 
7.3.3 above regarding SAE documentation). 
 The principal investigator will then report any deaths to the i nstitutional 
review board at the University of California San Francisco, the  
independent Data and Safety Monitor (DSM), and the NCCIH progra m 
officer within 24 hours of awareness of the event.   
 Other unexpected serious adverse events that are potentially 
intervention-related will be reported by the principal investigator to the 
UCSF IRB, the DSM, and the NCCIH Program Officer within 48 hour s of 
learning of the event.  
 Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but 
will also be reported to the UCSF IRB and the DSM within 1 week  of 
awareness of the event, and at least quarterly to the NCCIH Pro gram 
Officer.  Of note, no SAEs that are directly related to the stu dy procedures 
are currently anticipated. 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 30 of 52 Version 2. 3 
   
7.4.2   Non-Serious AE Reporting 
 
 If a clinical coordinator discovers an AE that does not meet th e definition 
of a SAE but may still pose a substantial risk of harm to a par ticipant and 
is potentially associated with study interventions or procedure s, he/she 
will report the AE to the principal investigator within 1 worki ng day, in 
addition to filling out a standardized AE form. 
 Cumulative trends in all non-serious adverse events will be rev iewed by 
the principal investigator and the DSM at scheduled DSM meeting s (see 
below for DSM meeting schedule). More frequent review of non-se rious 
adverse events may be performed if recommended by the DSM or 
desired by the principal investigator.  
 Although the UCSF IRB does not require reporting of non-serious  AEs to 
the UCSF IRB, the principal investigator may consult the UCSF IRB for input on handling of non-serious AEs if they may still pose a s ubstantial 
risk of harm to a participant or are potentially associated wit h study 
interventions or procedures.   
7.5 Follow-up for AEs/SAEs 
From the time that they are first reported by participants unti l the end of the study, 
AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolved or considered stab le. At each 
scheduled follow-up contact after initial discovery of an AE or  SAE, a clinical 
coordinator will assess whether the AE or SAE is continuing or has resolved, and will 
update information about event status on the AE or SAE form, as  appropriate. For 
SAEs, the clinical coordinator or principal investigator will also make more active 
attempts to communicate with participants in between scheduled study visits (with 
their permission) in order to monitor resolution of SAEs.   
7.6 Independent Safety Monitoring  
The conduct of the study and safety of participants will be evaluated by an independent Data and Safety Monitor (DSM), Dr. Andrew Avins, MD , MPH, Senior 
Research Scientist at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, wh o is a clinical 
researcher experienced with designing, implementing, and monito ring safety in 
therapeutic interventions studies as well as a practicing clinician. The DSM is independent of the investigators and staff participating in the study, and has no financial ties to the outcome of the study. The DSM will period ically review the 
conduct and outcomes of the study and provide feedback to the investigators, with particular attention to protecting the safety of the participan ts. 
Prior to initiation of the trial, the DSM will review and approve the study design and plans for recruitment, adherence, interventions, data quality, and safety monitoring.  At periodic intervals during the course of the trial, the DSM w ill evaluate the 
adequacy and timeliness of participant recruitment, adherence t o the protocol, and 
the potential of the study to meet the stated goals; evaluate t he quality and integrity 
of the data, including adequacy of data management and data security procedures; evaluate participant safety including trends in adverse events and relationship to the 
study procedures; consider factors external to the study when r elevant information, 
such as scientific developments, may have an impact on the safe ty of the 
participants or the ethical conduct of the study; and make reco mmendations, if 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 31 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  necessary, to the investigators, the UCSF IRB, and the NCCIH on  continuation, 
termination, or other modifications of the study protocol. 
The DSM will periodically review aggregate and unblinded trial data according to the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP).  An emergency meeting m ay also be 
called by the principal investigator at any time should questions of participant safety 
arise.  Each review will include an assessment of the adequacy and timeliness of 
participant recruitment, adherence to the visit and interventio n protocols, data quality 
and timeliness, adverse effects, and participant safety.  Interim reports for the DSM 
will be prepared by an unblinded biostatistician at the Women’s Health Clinical 
Research Center, and sent to the DSM at least 5 days prior to a  pre-scheduled 
meeting or conference call.  
After each interim review, the DSM will provide a signed statement that indicates 
whether the study should continue, terminate, or be altered bas ed on ability to meet 
study recruitment and data quality goals and participant safety. He will include any recommendations for changes to the protocol if necessary to enh ance participant 
safety or potentiate the ability of the trial to answer the research hypotheses.  This statement will be provided to the principal investigator and wi ll be sent to the UCSF 
IRB and to the NCCIH program officer.  All materials, discussions, and proceedings of the DSM process will be completely confidential.    
8.   INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
Participation in the yoga therapy and/or physical conditioning interventions may be 
discontinued if determined to be necessary to protect the safety of a participant.  The decision to discontinue the therapeutic intervention will be made on a case-by-case by the principal investigator, with input from the DSM if needed. Poss ible reasons for 
discontinuation of the therapeutic intervention may include: 1)  development of a clinically 
significant adverse event limiting a participant’s ability to safety take part in yoga or physical conditioning practice; 2) disruptive behavior exhibited by a participant during group yoga or physical conditioning classes or study visits that endangers th e safety or comfort of other 
study participants, class instructors, or study staff; or 3) de cision to terminate the study by 
the IRB, NCCIH, or other regulatory bodies. 
In the event that the yoga therapy or physical conditioning con trol intervention is 
discontinued, participants will continue to be followed through  the 24-week mail-in 
assessment (or early termination visit) to collect outcomes data, provided that the participant 
is willing and the principal investigator (with input from the DSM, if appropriate) judges that it is safe and feasible to do so. If follow-up assessments are con tinued, no modifications to the 
schedule of follow-up assessments will be made unless necessary  to protect the safety of 
participants or to accommodate limitations in function resultin g from an adverse event. 
Follow-up assessments in participants who have discontinued the therapeutic interventions will not include continue evaluation of adherence to group clas ses or home practice, 
assessment of yoga posture or practice adherence self-efficacy, or independent evaluation of participants’ success in performing yoga postures. 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
A parallel-group, superiority trial design has been selected as the being the most appropriate for the overall scientific goals of this research.  Although this pilot trial will 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 32 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  not be powered to prove or disprove any scientific hypotheses, it will provide a 
means of testing and refining procedures for a future full-scale parallel-group 
superiority trial to determine the efficacy of the therapeutic yoga intervention for 
improving urinary incontinence in middle-aged and older women.   
To control for the time and attention that participants will spend on group classes and 
home practice, a physical conditi oning exercise program has bee n selected as an 
active behavioral control intervention for this trial. Although  this control program may 
offer non-specific benefits for participants’ overall health, t he investigators believe 
that it is unlikely to substantially improve women’s incontinen ce. Inclusion of the 
physical conditioning program will also minimize differential expectations of treatment benefit between the two groups, in an effort to promote equal adherence to study interventions and visits in both groups. 
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization 
The investigative team plans to randomize and monitor up to 90 participants, with 
approximately 45 randomized to the yoga therapy group and 45 to  the physical 
conditioning control group.  No formal sample size estimates or  power analyses have 
been performed for this pilot study, as one of the goals of this pilot is to collect preliminary data that may be used to guide sample size estimate s for a larger clinical 
trial, if indicated. Study data on the standard deviation, intra-class correlation, and 
between-group difference in change in incontinence frequency and other efficacy 
outcomes will be used to guide sample size projections for a fu ture full-scale trial 
powered to detect a 25% greater reduction in incontinence frequ ency associated with 
yoga therapy. 
 
9.3       Intervention Assignment Procedures 
Randomization to the yoga therapy  or physical conditioning cont rol group will be 
performed by computer algorithm, with proof of eligibility required before assignment.  
Randomization will be implemented using randomly permuted block s of sizes 2 and 
4, and will also be stratified by clinical type of incontinence (i.e., stress, urgency, or 
mixed), to ensure adequacy of randomization within types. To av oid manipulation, 
standard allocation concealment procedures will be followed.
66  A study analyst will 
prepare sealed, opaque envelopes containing group assignment, n umbered 
consecutively with the randomization sequence numbers.  At the baseline visit, when 
eligibility and incontinence type have been confirmed, coordinators will enter the date, participant name, and study  ID in the randomization log a nd select the next 
numbered envelope to determine group assignment. All envelopes will be retained 
for review; randomization dates and times should follow the ord er of the sequence 
numbers, providing a check on validity.  Although participants cannot be blinded to 
treatment assignment (due to the behavioral nature of the inter vention), diary and 
questionnaire data used to evaluate the primary and secondary e fficacy outcomes 
will be abstracted by blinded analysts.  
9.4     Assessment of Feasibility of Recruitment and Retention 
The feasibility of recruiting and randomizing ambulatory middle -aged and older 
women with incontinence into a randomized controlled trial of a  yoga therapy versus 
physical conditioning program will be examined by monitoring th e average number of 
participants recruited and randomized per month and per recruit ment wave.  The 
study team will also track the success rate of various recruitment approaches (fliers, 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 33 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  print notices, newspaper ads, etc.) and monitor the costs of re cruitment per 
participant in order to guide future recruitment efforts.  The investigators plan to 
recruit and randomize 15 to 30 women in each 3-month enrollment  wave to confirm 
the feasibility of assembling a class size of 8 to 15 women per  group per wave in a 
future full-scale trial. 
The study team will also monitor participant retention rates during both the 12-week 
treatment period and the 12-week post-treatment follow-up perio d of the trial.  Drop-
out rates in both treatment groups are expected to increase ove r time (i.e., to be 
greater at 12 weeks than at 8 weeks or 4 weeks), but remain wit hin acceptable 
parameters at 12 weeks of treatment and 12 weeks of post-treatm ent follow-up.  If 
drop-out is substantial, the study team will conduct explorator y pooled logistic 
regression analyses to identify participant characteristics associated with drop-out.   
The following parameters will be used to measure the adequacy of retention: 
 During the 12-week intervention 12 weeks post-intervention 
Optimal < 10% < 20% 
Expected < 15% < 25% 
Acceptable < 20% < 30% 
 
9.5    Assessment of Adherence to Interventions  
The study team will assess the feasibility of maintaining parti cipant adherence to 
group classes and home practice by tracking the number and perc entage of 
participants in each intervention group who complete at least 7 5%, 80%, and 90% of 
the recommended group classes as well as 75%, 80%, and 90% of the 
recommended home practice hours during the 12-week treatment pe riod.  During the 
12-week post-treatment follow-up period, the study team will al so track the number 
and percentage of participants who complete 25%, 50%, and 75% o f recommended 
home practice hours; however, it should be noted that the study intervention is 
designed to be a self-contained 12-week intervention, in which sustained practice of 
yoga therapy or stretching/ strengthening exercises after the e nd of classes is 
encouraged but not considered mandatory.  If appropriate, explo ratory regression 
analyses will be used to identify participant characteristics a ssociated with 
adherence to group classes and home practice. 
The following parameters will be used to measure the adequacy o f adherence: 
 Attendance at group 
sessions during the 
12-week intervention Completion of home practice hours during the 12-week intervention Completion of home practice hours post-intervention* 
Optimal ≥ 90% ≥ 90% ≥ 75% 
Expected ≥ 80% ≥ 80% ≥ 50% 
Acceptable ≥ 75% ≥ 75% any 
*Practice of yoga or stretching/strengthening exercises at home  after 12 weeks, 
while desirable and encouraged, will not be considered mandatory to study success.

  9.6 Interim Analyses and Stopping Guidelines 
Interim analyses and/or stopping for unexpected efficacy : As this is a pilot study that 
is not powered to prove or disprove any hypotheses regarding efficacy, no formal 
interim analyses to evaluate efficacy will be performed. Given the short duration of 
treatment and small size of the study, the investigators believ e that there is no 
scientific or ethical reason to stop the trial early or alter the trial design if treatment appears to be more effective than expected. Thus, as long as no  safety issues arise, 
the trial will not be stopped or altered if the therapeutic intervention appears unexpectedly effective.  
Interim analyses and/or stopping for harm : Although this study involves a low-impact 
behavioral intervention that is not expected to pose a signific ant risk to participant 
safety, consideration may be given to stopping the trial early if unexpected and 
clinically significant adverse effects occur in either treatmen t group that may 
endanger the safety of participants. These may take the form of  SAEs or non-serious 
AEs posing a substantial safety risk and warranting early termination of the trial. If 
evidence of adverse effects emerges, the investigators in consu ltation with the DSM 
may determine that these side effects are minor and the study c an continue as 
planned, or may decide to alter or stop the study to prevent th ese side effects. 
Because the sample is small, and preservation of the nominal type-I error rate is less 
important for safety than for efficacy, no formal interim analy sis procedures are 
proposed. 
Interim analyses and stopping for futility : Consideration may be given to stopping the 
trial if recruitment and retention are so poor that the ability to meet recruitment goals 
or meet retention thresholds is severely compromised. For examp le, consideration 
will be given to stopping this study prior to its scheduled com pletion if recruitment 
falls more than 30% below planned rates and/or timely follow-up (i.e., completion of study visits within recommended windows) falls below 70%.
 
9.7 Outcomes  
9.7.1 Feasibility Outcomes   
The feasibility of recruiting and randomizing middle-aged and o lder women 
with urinary incontinence into a randomized trial of yoga thera py versus 
physical conditioning will be examined by calculating the avera ge number of 
participants recruited and randomized per month and per recruit ment wave.  
It is assumed that the study team will need to recruit and rand omize 15 to 30 
women in each 3-month enrollment wave to confirm ability to assemble a 
class size of 8 to 15 women per group per wave in a future full-scale trial.   
 
The feasibility of retaining participants in this trial design will be assessed by monitoring rates of drop-out or loss-to-follow-up over 8 and 12  weeks of 
treatment as well as during the 12-week post-treatment follow-u p period.  
Drop-out rates in both treatment groups are expected to increas e over time 
(i.e., to be greater at 12 weeks than at 8 weeks), but remain  less than 20% 
after 12 weeks of treatment and less than 30% at 12 weeks of po st-treatment 
follow-up.   
9.7.2 Primary Efficacy Outcome   
Although this pilot study will not be powered to prove or dispr ove any 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 35 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  hypotheses regarding efficacy, preliminary data will be gathered to guide 
planning on a future full-scale trial in which the primary efficacy outcome will 
be change in the average frequency of urinary incontinence based on a 
validated 3-day symptom diary.  To that end, frequency of incon tinence will 
be assessed based on voiding diaries completed at screening/bas eline, 8 
weeks, and 12 weeks, as well as 12 weeks after the completion o f the yoga 
therapy or physical conditioning programs.  The total number of  any, stress-
type, and urgency-type incontinence episodes will be calculated  for each 
diary and then divided by the total number of days of recording  to calculate 
the average number of incontinence episodes per day of each type. 
9.7.3 Secondary Efficacy Outcomes   
Preliminary data will also be gathered to guide planning for a future full-scale 
trial evaluating secondary efficacy outcomes such as change in other symptom and quality-of-life outcomes associated with incontinence.  To that 
end, changes in anxiety and perceived stress symptoms and incon tinence-
related quality of life will be assessed using validated questi onnaires 
completed at screening/baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks, as well as 12 
weeks after the completion of yoga therapy or physical conditio ning 
programs.  
9.8 Data Analyses  
To address aim 1 (feasibility), descriptive statistical techniques will be used to describe rates of recruitment, randomization, retention, and ad herence for each 
recruitment wave.  If drop-out is substantial, we will conduct exploratory pooled 
logistic regression analyses to try to identify participant cha racteristics associated 
with drop-out. Similarly, if adherence is less than expected, we will use linear, 
logistic, and/or proportional odds models, depending on the distribution of the 
outcome, to explore associations of participant characteristics  with levels of 
adherence both to classes and home practice.  To address aim 2 (preliminary efficacy for change in incontinen ce frequency), we will 
use linear mixed models with unstructured residual covariance matrix to conduct a preliminary analysis of the 8, 12, and 24 week changes from baseline in incontinence frequency, adjusting for the baseline values, and treating week  as categorical. This 
will provide estimates of the residual standard deviation, intra-class correlation, and fitted between-group differences at each follow-up time point. To assess trends and 
persistence, we will compare estimated between-group differences across weeks.  
All estimates will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. 
 The methods specified for aim 2 will also be used for aim 3 (preliminary efficacy for secondary symptom and quality-of-life outcomes).  Outcomes will  be normalized as 
necessary before analysis, and checked for equal variance acros s group and 
visit.  In previous studies, changes in incontinence frequency and in other symptom 
and quality-of-life scores have been approximately normally dis tributed.

  10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Study data will be obtained from participant-completed symptom diaries and logs, 
participant- or interviewer-administered questionnaires, physical examination and 
performance measures, and urine sampling/testing. Forms for rec ording or 
abstracting data will be developed specifically for this study, including: 
- Voiding diary abstraction form: After participants complete t heir 3-day voiding 
diary at home, they will return the completed diary to the stud y clinic, and diary 
data will be abstracted using a Voiding Diary Abstraction Form. At the Baseline 
Visit, a clinical coordinator will abstract diary data for eligibility assessment purposes; at all post-randomization follow-up assessments, an analyst who is blinded to intervention assignment will abstract diary data. 
- Questionnaires assessing anxiety and perceived stress, condit ion-specific quality 
of life, and participant satisfaction:  These questionnaire for ms will be completed 
by the participant during clinic visits and returned in person to a clinical 
coordinator, or completed by the participant at home and then mailed back to the study clinic (in the case of the 12 week post-treatment assessm ent). 
Questionnaire data collected after randomization will be entere d into the 
electronic database by an analyst who is blinded to interventio n assignment. 
- Questionnaires assessing demographic history, general medical and 
urologic/urogynecologic history, medication use, tobacco and al cohol use, and 
physical activity and function: These questionnaires will be ad ministered by a 
clinical coordinator during in-person study visits, and data fr om questionnaires 
will subsequently be entered by the coordinator into the electr onic database. 
Because these data will not be used to assess efficacy outcomes, the coordinators who administer and entering data from these forms will not necessarily be blinded to intervention assignment. 
- Physical examination, physical performance testing, and urine  testing data forms: 
Clinical coordinators will record the results of height and wei ght measurements, 
blood pressure and heart rate measurements, physical performanc e testing, and 
urine dipstick and pregnancy testing on study-specific forms, and data from these forms will then be entered by coordinators into the electronic database. Because 
these data will not be used to assess any efficacy outcomes, th e coordinators 
who are responsible for collecting, recording, and entering the se data will not 
necessarily be blinded to intervention assignment. 
10.2 Data Management  
Data will be entered, managed, and edited using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure, web-based application developed by a multi-institutional consortium initiated at Vanderbilt University to support data c apture for research 
studies. Data can be entered from any location with secure web authentication, data 
logging, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption.  REDCap offers advanced 
features including auto-validation, branching logic, stop actio ns, data import 
functions, and data comparison functions. The REDCap system com plies with 
HIPAA regulations, data will be stored on HIPAA compliant serve s, protected by 
firewalls. 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 37 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  10.3 Quality Assurance  
10.3.1 Staff Training 
All investigators, project directors, and clinical coordinators  involved in the 
study will complete training in Human Subjects Research offered  by the 
Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI), which includes specific 
training modules on assessing risk to subjects, avoiding group harms, 
conflicts of interest, cultural competence, FDA-regulated resea rch, HIPAA-
regulated research, informed consent, IRB member responsibiliti es, IRB chair 
responsibilities, records-based research, research with vulnera ble subjects, 
and unanticipated problems and reporting.  All investigators, project directors, and coordinators will maintain active CITI certification for the duration of the study. 
Coordinators and analysts involved in data collection will also  attend a study-
specific training meeting led by the principal investigator and  the project 
directors prior to the start of participant recruitment.  At a minimum, the 
training meeting will include: (1) an introduction to the goals, design, and 
procedures of the LILA study; (2) an overview of goals, structu re, and 
procedures for administering and abstracting data from the voiding diary and other study-specific data collection measures; (3) a review of definitions and procedures for assessing, documenting, and reporting adverse ev ents.   
Coordinators and analysts will also receive training and undergo supervised practice in reviewing and abstracting data from the voiding dia ry as the 
primary efficacy measure in the trial. They will also receive training and undergo supervised practice performing measurements of blood pr essure 
and heart rate and assessing physical function/performance meas ures.  
Following the training, clinical staff will be certified for pe rforming these 
functions.
 
10.3.2 Data Quality Assessment 
Data collection forms will be reviewed on an ongoing basis for data completeness and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. All forms used to collect data on primary and secondary efficacy outcomes (i.e., voiding diary 
abstraction forms, questionnaires addressing anxiety and percei ved stress 
and condition-specific quality of life) will be verified against paper-based source forms by a staff member who was not involved in entering the data.  Quality of data entry will be periodically assessed using measu res such as 
number of missing forms, number of missing queries, and proport ion of all 
study variables queried. The results of assessment of data quality will be incorporated into study progress reports for scheduled DSM meet ings.  
10.3.3 Protocol Deviations 
Exceptions to the protocol are expected to occur rarely or not at all and, 
where possible, will be approved in advance by the principal in vestigator. 
Protocol exceptions may occur for the following reasons: 
• exceptions necessary to protect the safety or well-being of a  participant 
(in this case, the protocol exception should apply to that part icipant only) 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 38 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  • exceptions due to oversight or error on the part of study sta ff, which are 
subsequently detected by the investigators, project managers, c linical 
coordinators, or data analysts. 
 
For each protocol exception, study staff will document the exce ption on a 
Protocol Exceptions Log (located in the Regulatory Binder). Entries in the 
Protocol Exceptions Log should include the participant ID, date of the exception, date exception is being recorded, description of exc eption, and 
action taken in response to the exception, if any. The principal investigator will document approval for each exception determined in advance , or 
acknowledgement for each exception detected after the fact.   For this study, missed yoga therapy or physical conditioning cl asses will not 
be considered a protocol deviation, and neither will failure to  complete 
recommended home practice sessions, although study staff will m ake every 
effort to promote adherence to classes and home practice (see section 5.4). 
10.3.4 Monitoring 
If desired by NCCIH, the study t eam will undergo on-site monitoring by an 
independent quality monitor who is independent of both the spon sor and 
UCSF (e.g., Westat). Site monitoring visits may include review of participant 
records, informed consent forms, source data collection forms, and the 
electronic study database. The schedule of site monitoring will  be agreed 
upon in advance by NCCIH, the principal investigator, and the i ndependent 
monitoring organization. The principal investigator, project manager, and study coordinators will be available to meet in person with the  independent 
monitor and provide access to all study-specific forms, materials, and databases. 
11. PARTICIPANT RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  
The study protocol, informed consent document, data and safety monitoring plan, 
and data collection forms will be reviewed and approved by the UCSF IRB prior to 
implementation of study procedures. Any subsequent modification s to these 
documents will also be reviewed and approved by the UCSF IRB prior to administration in the study. 
11.2 Informed Consent Forms 
A signed consent form will be obtained from each participant at  the Screening Visit 
before in-person data collection procedures are initiated (see section 6.2.2. for description of informed consent procedures). A copy of the consent form will be given to each participant, and documentation of signed consent will be filed in the 
participant’s study file.  The template for the form is attache d as Appendix A. 
11.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Study data will be protected to preserve participant confidenti ality both during and 
after the study. Each participant will be assigned a unique num erical study identifier 
which will be used on study forms instead of names or other ide ntifying information. 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 39 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  The document linking study ID to participant identifiers (name, address, contact 
names and addresses) will be maintained in a password-protected file stored on a 
secure server protected by firewalls. Only the clinical coordinators or study 
investigators who need to get access to participant identifiers  to contact participants 
will have access to the password to this file.   
Paper source forms will be stored in a locked cabinet in a lock ed office at the UCSF 
Women’s Health Clinical Research Center, and only research staf f who need to 
access these forms for data collection, data editing, or qualit y monitoring purposes 
will have the key to this cabinet. Information that could ident ify individual participants 
will not be released without written permission of the participant, except as 
necessary for monitoring by the  IRB, NCCIH, the OHRP, or other government 
agencies responsible for protecting participant safety. Paper-b ased source forms will 
be securely destroyed 3 years after the end of the study. 
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time at the recommendation  of the UCSF IRB, 
NCCIH, the OHRP, or other government agencies if necessary to p rotect the safety 
or confidentiality of research participants.  
12.  PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  
Any publications resulting from this research will be made avai lable to the public consistent 
with the NIH public access policy. At the request of the NCCIH program officer, the 
principal investigator will also provide a copy of any abstracts or manuscripts resulting from 
this work to the program officer prior to submission.

Study Title: Lessening Incontinence through Low-impact Activity  (LILA)  
 
This is a research study about two types of low-impact physical activity-based programs to improve urinary incontinence in women. The study researchers, A lison Huang, MD, MAS and 
Leslee Subak, MD, and their associates from the UCSF Department  of Medicine, UCSF 
Department of Obstetrics, Gynec ology, and Reproductive Sciences , and the UCSF Women’s 
Health Clinical Research Center , will explain this study to you . 
 Medical research studies include only people who choose to take  part.  Take your time to make 
your decision about participating .  You may discuss your decisi on with your family and friends 
and with your health care team.  If you have any questions, you  may ask the study staff.  
 You are being asked to take part in this study because you are a woman with urinary 
incontinence.  
 
Why is this study being done?  
The purpose of this study is to gather information about the effects of a group-based yoga or low-impact physical conditioning program on urinary incontinenc e in women. The National 
Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) is prov iding funding for this study.   
 
How many people will take part in this study?  
About 60 women aged 50 years or older will participate in this study at UCSF.  
 
What will happen if I take part in this research study? 
 
The study will require up to 4 in-person clinic visits (screeni ng visit, baseline visit, 8-week visit, 
and final 12-week visit), 24 yoga or physical conditioning grou p training sessions (an initial 
orientation, followed by twice weekly group classes for weeks 1 -12), up to 3 telephone visits 
(Randomization, Week 2, and Week 24), and 1 mail-in visit packet (Week 24).   Before you begin the main part of the study, you will undergo the following procedures to make sure you understand the requirements of the study and t hat you are eligible: 
 
Screening Visit  (located at the UCSF Women’s Health Research Office at 2330 Post Street) 
 If you decide you want to be in the study, you will have the following procedures to find out if 
you qualify to be in this study:  
 The study will be discussed with you, and you will be asked to  review and sign the 
consent form. 
 Your medical and gynecologic history will be reviewed, including all medications you are 
currently taking. 
 Your height, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate will be me asured. 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 45 of 52 Version 2. 3 
   You will be asked to give a urine sample to check for signs of urinary tract infection and 
pregnancy. 
 We will give you questionnaires to fill out, which will includ e information on your 
race/ethnicity, relationship status, educational history, and health-related behaviors such 
as drinking alcohol, smoking, and exercise.   
 If you qualify so far, you will receive a 3-day voiding diary (a diary in which you will 
record when you urinate or have accidental urine leakage) and d etailed instructions on 
how to complete it. You will be asked to complete the diary at home bring it with you to 
your next visit. 
 You be given a follow-up appointment for the Baseline Visit. 
 
This screening visit will take about one hour.   Baseline Visit (located at the UCSF Women’s Health Research Office at 2330 Pos t Street)  
 
One to two weeks after the Screening Visit, you will return for the Baseline Visit.  You will have 
the following additional procedures done at this visit:   
 You will be asked if you have had any changes in your health o r in your medications.  
 Your completed 3-day voiding diary will be collected and revie wed by study staff.

information you provide is confidential, some people feel embar rassed at having to answer 
these types of questions. There will be slight inconvenience in  time and effort to complete 
the questionnaires. 
 
 Yoga Program:  There is minimal risk associated with participating in the yog a intervention.  
Risks are rare but may include muscle soreness and muscle or ligament strain, or other musculoskeletal injury if you were to fall or lose balance. The  instructors providing 
instruction for these classes are certified yoga instructors with years of experience 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 49 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  instructing people of a wide range of ages and with chronic health conditions. We will be 
using props such as blocks and straps to help you to perform the yoga postures, and the 
instructors will help you modify poses that are uncomfortable. 
 
 Physical conditioning program:  There is minimal risk associated with participation in the 
physical conditioning  intervention. Rare risks include muscle soreness and muscle or 
ligament strain, or other musculoskeletal injury if you were to  fall or lose balance. The 
trained instructors will have physical therapy or other qualifi ed backgrounds and will provide 
instruction on low-impact stretching and strengthening exercise s that have been approved 
for use by our expert Physical Therapist consultant.   
 Physical Examination Measurements: There are no risks associated with having your 
height, weight, blood pressure, or heart rate, although you may  find this to be inconvenient 
or unpleasant.   
 
 Assessment of Physical Mobility :  There are no significant risks associated with 
evaluation of your walking speed, balance, and ability to rise from the ground and from a chair, but you may find this to be inconvenient or unpleasant. 
 
 Urine Dipstick and Pregnancy Testing: There are no direct risks associated with collection of the screening urine sample, although some partici pants may experience this as 
inconvenient or unpleasant. 
 Behavioral Incontinence Self-Management Pamphlet:  Provision of standard written information on usual first-line behavioral self-management stra tegies for incontinence such 
as pelvic floor muscle exercises and timed urination should pos e no risks to participants, 
although participants may find it inconvenient or unpleasant to  read the pamphlet. 
 Unknown Risks:  The experimental treatments may have side effects that no one knows 
about yet.  The researchers will let you know if they learn any thing that might make you 
change your mind about participating in the study. 
 
 For more information about risks and side effects, ask your stu dy doctor. 
 Are there benefits to taking part in the study?  
 Taking part in this study may or may not make your urinary inco ntinence better.  While doctors 
hope that yoga practice or physical conditioning exercises will  be effective in improving urinary 
incontinence, there is no proof of this yet. Low impact physica l activity techniques, such as yoga 
and stretching, have been reported to reduce stress and anxiety and improve sleep as well as improve overall fitness. Information gained from this study may  help develop new treatments for 
individuals with urinary incontinence    What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this stud y? 
Your other choices include: 
 Getting no treatment 
 Getting standard treatment for your urinary incontinence withou t being in a study. 
o Regular primary care and gynecologic care is available at UCSF for women with 
incontinence who choose not to enroll in this study. There are FDA-approved 
medications for some types of incontinence which are available by prescription. 
Study Product Guidelines and Consi derations 50 of 52 Version 2. 3 
  o Yoga and physical conditioning classes are available at gyms an d studios in the 
community.  These have not yet been proven to be effective for the treatment of 
incontinence and are not considered to be standard care.  
 Getting a different experimental treatment/taking part in anoth er study.

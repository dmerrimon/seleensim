TITLE 6-Month, Multicenter, Randomized, Open-label, 2-Arm, Parallel-group Study 
Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of a New Formulation of Insulin Glargine and 
Lantus® Injected Once Daily in Children and Adolescents age 6 - 17 years with 
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with a 6-month Safety Extension Period 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Multinational, multicenter 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 3b 
STUDY OBJECTIVES 
 Primary objective To compare the efficacy of a new formulation of insulin glargine (HOE901-U300) to 
Lantus in terms of change of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline to 
endpoint (scheduled month 6) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
Secondary objectives  
To compare HOE901-U300 and Lantus in terms of: 
• Percentage of patients reaching target HbA1c (<7.5%) at month 6 
overall and without any episode of severe and/or documented 
symptomatic hypoglycemia during last 3 months of the main 6-month 
randomized period; 
• Change from baseline to endpoint (month 6) in fasting plasma glucose 
(central laboratory); 
• Percent of patients reaching target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) value 
(≤130 mg/dL [7.2 mmol/L]) at month 6 overall and without any episode of 
severe and/or documented symptomatic hypoglycemia during the last 
3 months of the main 6-month randomized period; 
• Change in mean self-monitored plasma glucose (8-point SMPG profiles, 
24-hour mean plasma glucose, va riability of 24-hour mean plasma 
glucose)  from baseline to month 6; 
To assess the safety of HOE901-U300 including analysis of events of hypoglycemia, events of hyperglycemia with ketosis and development of anti-insulin-antibodies; 
To assess the extent of accumulation and metabolism of HOE901-U300 versus 
Lantus in this age group. 
STUDY DESIGN Open-label, 1:1 randomized, active-controlled, 2-arm parallel-group, multicenter 
international study comparing HOE901-U300 versus Lantus in children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). 
Randomization will be stratified by age group (<12 years and ≥12 years) and by 
HbA1c value (<8.5% and ≥ 8.5%), both at the screening visit. The study will include 
a 2-week screening period, a 6-month efficacy and safety period followed by a  
6-month safety extension period and a 4- week post-treatment follow up period. 
Inclusion in the study is configured to ensure at least 30% of participants in the 
age range below 12 years.

Investigational medicinal products 
 
Formulation Tested drug: HOE901-U300 
HOE901-U300 will be supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, colorless solution 
in the Toujeo SoloStar prefilled (dispos able) pen (insulin glargine 300 units/mL 
solution for subcutaneous injection). 
Each Toujeo SoloStar contains in total 450 units of insulin glargine (1.5 mL of 
300 units/mL insulin glargine solution). This pen allows dose setting in the range of 1–80 units with minimum of 1 unit increment. 
Mixing of HOE901-U300 with other insulin products is not allowed nor dilution. 
Control drug: Lantus (Insulin glargine) Lantus will be supplied as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, clear, colorless solution in the 
marketed Lantus SoloStar prefilled (disposable) pen (insulin glargine 100 U/mL 
solution for subcutaneous injection).  
Each Lantus SoloStar contains in total 300 units of insulin glargine (3.0 mL of 
100 units/mL insulin glargine solution). This pen allows dose setting in the range of 1–80 units with minimum of 1 unit increment. 
Mixing of Lantus with other insulin products is not allowed nor dilution. 
Route of administration Tested drug:  HOE901-U300 will be administered by subcutaneous (SC) 
injections once daily (self-administrat ion or administration assisted by the 
parent/caregiver).  
Control drug : Lantus will be administered by SC injections once daily (self-
administration or administration assisted by the parent/caregiver).  
Dose regimen The same dose regimen will be used for HOE901-U300 and the comparator 
Lantus. 
Starting dose: The starting dose of the HOE901-U300 or Lantus will be the same 
(Unit for Unit) as the median dose (ie, the middle value out of the three values) of 
the total daily basal insulin doses in the last 3 days prior to the baseline visit, except if the patient was on more than once daily basal insulin products (eg, NPH 
insulin, insulin detemir), when the starting dose of HOE901-U300 or Lantus (U) 
should be reduced by approximately 20%. 
Dose titration: Dosing of insulin glar gine given as HOE901-U300 or Lantus will be 
done based on self-measured, fasting, pre-break fast plasma glucose levels (target 
range 90–130 mg/dL; 5.0–7.2 mmol/L) while avoiding hypoglycemia.   
After the end of study treatment patients on HOE901-U300 will have to switch from 
their daily HOE901-U300 dose to a non-study  U100 basal insulin formulation by 
reducing the daily dose by 20% taking into account overall metabolic control. 
Non-investigational medicinal 
product(s)  
Formulation Patients in both treatment groups will continue with their fast-acting mealtime 
insulin analogue during the study. 
Solution for subcutaneous injection 
Route of administration Subcutaneous injection 
Dose regimen 
 Dosing of the fast-acting mealtime insulin will be done based on self-measured, 
postprandial plasma glucose levels, tar get range for 2-hour post-prandial plasma 
glucose is <180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) or, if clinically indicated, other individually 
determined goal.

  Efficacy:   see Study Flowchart.  
Safety:  see Study Flowchart . 
Pharmacokinetics (PK):   Sparse sampling approach: 3 blood samples will be 
taken from all patients who consent to this assessment over a single day only after 
end of titration phase; during the period from Visit 13, Week 20 to Visit 14, 
Week 26 (see study flow chart). 
Anti-Insulin Antibodies: see study flow chart 
Early termination:   
In case of premature permanent Inve stigational Medicinal Product (IMP) 
discontinuation, all assessments norma lly planned for V18, Week 52 should be 
performed as soon as possible after last  IMP administration. The patients will be 
asked to continue attending study visits and undergo assessments according to 
the schedule until the planned end of study treatment (month 12), including 
assessments normally scheduled for the 4-week post-treatment follow up period. 
For safety considerations, patients who wis h to terminate participation in the study 
whatsoever, at the minimum should be assessed using the procedure normally 
planned for the post-treatment follow-up 1 visit (Visit 19). 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: The sample size was chosen to ensure sufficient power for the primary endpoint 
(change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint).  A sample size of 450 randomized patients (225 for HOE901-U300 and 225 for 
Lantus) will ensure that the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the adjusted mean differenc e between HOE901-U300 and Lantus would 
not exceed a non-inferiority margin of 0.3% HbA1c with 92% power. This calculation assumes a common standard deviation (SD) of 0.95%, with a one-sided test at the 2.5% significant level and a true difference of zero in HbA1c 
between treatment groups. 
General aspects of the analyses: For efficacy analyses, the baseline is defi ned as the last available value obtained 
up to the date of randomization. Analysis population: The primary efficacy population is the in tent-to-treat (ITT) population, which 
includes all randomized patients analyzed according to the treatment group 
allocated by randomization. 
The safety population is defined as all pat ients randomized and exposed to at least 
one dose of IMP, regardless of the amount of  treatment administered. In the event 
of patients having received treatments that  differed from those assigned according 
to the randomization schedule, then the safety analyses will be conducted 
according to the treatment received rather than according to the randomization 
groups. 
Primary analysis: The primary efficacy variable (change in  HbA1c from baseline to endpoint 
[month 6]), will be analyzed in the ITT popul ation, using all post-baseline data 
available on the main 6-month randomiz ed period (ITT estimand). A multiple 
imputation approach in two parts will be us ed where missing data from patients 
who do not adhere to IMP will be represented by the data from those patients in 
the same treatment group who also did not adhere to IMP but had the

The adjusted least squares mean change in HbA1c from baseline to month 6 for 
each treatment group (HOE901-U300, Lantus ) will be estimated, as well as the 
between-group (HOE901-U300, Lantus) difference and the 95% CI for the 
adjusted mean. 
A stepwise closed testing approach will be used for the primary efficacy variable to 
assess non-inferiority and superiority sequentially.  
Step 1 will proceed to assess non-inferiority of HOE901-U300 versus Lantus. To 
assess non-inferiority, the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference 
in the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint between HOE901-U300 
and Lantus will be compared with the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3% 
HbA1c. Non-inferiority will be demonstr ated if the upper bound of the two-sided 
95% CI of the difference between HOE901-U300 and Lantus on ITT population is <0.3%. 
Only if non-inferiority of HOE901-U300 versus Lantus has been demonstrated, 
step 2 will be performed to test superiority of HOE901-U300 over Lantus. The 
superiority of HOE901-U300 over Lantus will be demonstrated if the upper bound 
of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean change in HbA1c from 
baseline to endpoint between HOE 901-U300 and Lantus on ITT population 
is <0 (zero). 
The tests for the primary endpoint (mont h 6) will be performed one-sided at level 
α = 0.025. A sensitivity analysis will be performed on change in HbA1c from baseline to 
month 6 on patients who complete the main 6-month on-treatment period in the 
ITT population (ie, patients who perfo rm Visit 14 [Week 26] and who do not 
permanently discontinue treatment). 
In order to assess the impact of missing data, a penalized multiple imputation (MI) 
and a tipping point analysis will also be performed as sensitivity analyses. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints: 
Categorical efficacy parameters (res ponder rates) will be analyzed by using 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method with treatment as factors, stratified by 
randomization stratum of HbA1c (<8.5%, ≥8.5%) and by randomization stratum of 
age group (<12 years and ≥12 years) at screening. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the ITT population, using all 
available data on the 6-month r andomized period (ITT estimand).  
A similar multiple imputation approach in two parts, as for the primary efficacy 
endpoint, will be used for change from baseline in FPG at Week 26. This analysis 
will be used descriptively. 
The other continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed descriptively only. 
PK analyses:  
Blood samples will be collected to measure insulin glargine and its metabolites 
(M1 and M2) in plasma. PK analysis will be based on sparse sampling collected 
over a single day and will be done through a population PK approach. 
Safety analyses: 
Safety analyses will be descriptive using the safety population. Treatment 
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that developed or 
worsened or became serious during the period from the first dose administration of 
study treatment up to 2 days after the last administration.

a)  Mandatory telephone visit or optional clinical visit.  Additional, optional telephone visits to monitor and support the progre ss of insulin titration will be scheduled at the discretion of the investigator 
b) Or early termination visit. In case of premature and permanent IMP discontinuation, all assessments planned for V18 should be p erformed as soon as possible after last study treatment administration. The patient will be asked to attend all 
scheduled study visits and undergo study procedures until the planned end of treatment visit (or end of the 4-week post-treatme nt follow up period, whichever comes last). A post-treatment follow-up 1 safety phone call should be planned 
2 days (+2 days) after IMP discontinuation as well as post-treatment follow-up 2 safety phone call 4 weeks (±5 days) after IMP discontinuation 
c) The date of menarche will be captured if applicable 
d) At each on-site visit: Heart rate, blood pressure in sitting position 
e) Height at visits week -2 (screening), week 12, week 26  and during the extension period at visit week 38 and week 52 (or early IMP termination). BMI will be determined based on body weight and height. 
f) Tanner puberty stage until complete sexual maturity defined by Tanner stage 5 
g) IVRS/IWRS contact: before any blood sample is drawn because the patient number as allocated by IVRS/IWRS has to be reported on the laboratory requisition forms 
h) Self-monitored plasma glucose: 
Fasting plasma glucose:  on at least 5 days in the week before each visit;  
It is recommended to perform fasting SMPG  daily throughout the study. When up-titration of the IMP has been completed and fasting (pre-breakfast) SMPG is stable in the t arget range, the number of fasting SMPG checks can be reduced 
according to the investigator’s judgment, however at least 3 fasting (pre-breakfast) SMPG measurements per week should be done.  On days when 8-point profiles are done, fasting SMPG will be considered as the second point of 
measurement, ie, the before breakfast time point.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 14  8-point blood glucose profiles (starting with a measurement between 01:00 – 04:00 AM at night; before and 2 hours after breakfa st; before and 2 hours after lunch; before and 2 hours after dinner; at bedtime):  on at least 
one day in the week before the baseline visit, and the visits week 26 and week 52. Special attention should be paid that the ni ghttime SMPG value is recorded ( 1) 
SMPG during symptomatic hypoglycemia:  whenever the patients feel hypoglycemic symptoms, plasma glucose should be measured by the patient (or others, if applicable),  if possible. Patients should be instructed to measure plasma 
glucose levels prior to the administration of glucose or carbohydrate intake whenever symptomatic hypoglycemia is suspected, unless safety considerations necessitate immediate glucose/carbohydrate rescue prior to confirmation. Details 
of all hypoglycemia events will be reported on dedicated electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF) pages. 
Complementary SMPG : it is recommended to perform 4-6 SMPG daily at different times of the day and measure the nighttime SMPG once weekly for opti mal control of glycemia and adjustment of the insulin regimen. Additional SMPG 
are recommended in association with exercise/sport (before start, during and after activity and at bedtime) and at sick days, m enses. 
Tests using the control solution : It is recommended to perform tests with the control solution before first use of the study glucose meter, in cases when SMPG reading is considered incorrect or inconsistent with symptoms and whenever 
a new batch of test strips is used. 
i) Anytime SMPG ≥252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) is measured in an unwell child or when persistent blood glucose values above ≥252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) without substantial decline are present over a period of approximately 60-120 min after an 
extra dose of rapid-acting insulin, or during illness with fever and/or vomiting. Ketone readings are to be documented in the d iary. 
j) Hematology: Erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocytes, differential blood count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eo sinophils, basophils) and platelets 
k) Clinical chemistry: total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated  bilirubin), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ) (Schwartz equation),  sodium, potassium, chloride,  calcium 
l) Hepatitis serology: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and Hepatitis C viral antibodies (HCAb); if HCAb positive: reflex test for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA  
m) Urine analysis: pH, glucose, ketones, leucocytes, blood/hemoglobin, protein 
n) Microalbuminuria, albumin/creatinine ratio: in first morning urine sample. Container to be dispensed at Visit 1 
o) For post-menarchal girls; serum pregnancy test for screening (central laboratory); urine pregnancy test (at study site) for sub sequent monitoring; review of contraceptive measures at each on-site visit 
p) PK sparse sampling will be collected in patients who provided dedicated consent over one day after the end of titration phase d uring the period from visit 13, week 20 to visit 14, week 26. The sample times will depend on the existing 
dosing regimen:  
- Participants with dose administered in the evening (~ 20:00)  on the day before the date of the visit: sample schedule: 12 h, 1 6 h and 20 h post-dose (which will be around 08:00, 12:00, 16:00 on day of visit) 
- Participants with dose administered in the morning (~ 08:00)  on the day of the visit: sample schedule: pre-dose, 4 h, and 8 h post-dose (which will be around 08:00, 12:00, 16:00 on visit day) 
q) At last study visit (if performed as an on-site visit) or shortly thereafter 
Note:  Telephone counseling will be available at any time as needed.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 23  4 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 
Insulin glargine U100 (HOE901) is 21A-Glycine-30Ba -L-arginine-30Bb-L-Arginine-human 
insulin, a recombinant analog of human insulin providing a 24-hour basal insulin supply after a 
single-dose subcutaneous (SC) injection.  Insu lin glargine U100 has been marketed as Lantus® for 
approximately 15 years. Its efficacy and safety are well-known th rough extensive data collection 
involving over 200 000 patients in clinical studies, including randomized, cont rolled clinical trials 
and the results of postmarketing surveillance arising from approxima tely 66.9 million patient-
years of clinical experience. Further informati on on Lantus, including important clinical trials 
performed pre- and postregistration, can be found in the national product la bel or in the Product 
Information ( 2) and Investigator´s Brochure HOE901 ( 3). 
Insulin glargine U100 (Lantus) is approved for a on ce daily injection for the treatment of diabetes 
in adults and pediatric (age range 6 to 15 years; in the EU also in preschoolers 1–6 years of age) 
patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM). 
HOE901-U300 is a new formulation of insulin glargine. It has the same composition as the 
marketed insulin glargine 100 U/mL formulation with adjustment of 3- times the amount of Active 
Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and corresponding Zi nc content. Toujeo was approved in the US 
on February 25, 2015 and in the European Union on April 12, 2015 for the treatment of adults 
with diabetes mellitus. Review of the regulatory submission documents is ongoing in other countries worldwide. 
Insulin glargine has the same metabolism regard less of the concentration of the formulation, 
notably the formation of 21
A-Gly-human insulin (M1 metabolite) as the predominant circulating 
metabolite. The difference between HOE 901-U300 and Lantus rests in the 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) profile which shows slower and more prolonged 
absorption of HOE901-U300 resulting in a flatter time-concen tration profile. 
Based on the results of Phase 1 studies with HOE901-U300 in healthy subjects and adults with 
T1DM (PKD10086, PKD11627 and TDR11626), it was antic ipated that compared to Lantus, the 
prolonged and flatter profile of the glucose-lowering activity of HOE901-U300 (up to 36 hours) 
could result in more constant glycemic control within a 24-hour  injection interval, in turn, 
resulting in less circadian fluctuation in blood gl ucose levels and lower risk of hypoglycemia. 
In Phase 3 clinical studies in a broad range of adult patient populati on with T1DM and T2DM, 
HOE901-U300 has shown comparable efficacy, safety  and tolerability to Lantus with different 
pre-treatment regimens and dos e requirements of insulin. In patients with T2DM, HOE901-U300 
was consistently associated with a lower risk of  hypoglycemia as compared with Lantus, as shown 
for severe and/or confirmed hypoglycemia. In the study in T1DM (EFC12456) there was no 
difference between the treatment groups for percenta ges of patients reporting  hypoglycemia or the 
event rates per patient year. In the study the assessment of the hypoglycemia risk associated with 
the basal insulin may have been confounded by the concomitant use of  fast-acting insulin. 
Further details on HOE901-U300 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure HOE901.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 24  Since Lantus is approved in the T1DM pediatric population 6 to 18 years of age, it is anticipated 
that HOE901-U300 may also be used in this popul ation. This study is planned to generate 
evidence of efficacy and safety of HOE901-U300 in children and adolescents 6-17 years of age 
with T1DM requiring insulin treatment. 
The purpose of this multicenter, randomized, open- label, 2-arm parallel-group study in children 
and adolescents is to compare the efficacy and safety of HOE901-U300 with that of Lantus, both 
given once-daily by SC injecti on. Patients with type 1 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c) in the range of 7.5% to 11% on a basal pl us fast-acting insulin re gimen are eligible for 
the study. Patients with hospitalization for diab etic ketoacidosis (DKA) or history of severe 
hypoglycemia (as defined by need for glucagon or intravenous [IV] glucose) during the previous 
3 months, are excluded from the study. 
Patients will be randomized (1:1) to  receive HOE901-U300 or Lantus. 
Patients will be stratified by their HbA1c ( <8.5%; ≥ 8.5%) and age group (<12 years; ≥12 years) at 
the time of screening. Inclusion in the study is configured to ensure at least 30% of participants in 
the age range below 12 years. The primary effi cacy analysis will test non-inferiority of  
HOE901-U300 compared to Lantus in terms of change of HbA1c from baseline to endpoint 
(month 6; non-inferiority margin 0.3% HbA1c units).  
Secondary analyses will be performed to evaluate th e effects of the flat insulin profile over at least 
24 hours, which should result in more sustained gl ycemic control within predefined blood glucose 
margins. The analyses will be based on fasting pl asma glucose (FPG, central laboratory), on self-
monitored plasma glucose measur ements (SMPG; eg, 8-point gluc ose profiles), hypoglycemia 
reports and insulin doses. A thorough hypoglycemia analysis will be performed. Evaluations will include incidence of 
hypoglycemia (number of patients with at least one hypoglycemia) and hypoglycemia episodes 
per patient year. Hypoglycemia episodes will be evaluated overall and by time of the day, (ie, daytime, nocturnal, overall, distribution ove r the 24-hour period) and by study periods. The 
American Diabetes Asso ciation (ADA) definitions will be a pplied to define the hypoglycemia 
categories ( 4, 5). All confirmed hypoglycemia categories will be also evaluated for the more 
stringent SMPG threshold of <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L). In addition, composite categories 
including the clinically important categories of severe hypoglycemia  and/or symptomatic 
hypoglycemia documented by SM PG <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) and ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) will 
be evaluated. Other safety evaluation will include the comparison of clinical treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), hyperglycemia with ketosis, hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions. Laboratory safety will include the standard hematology and biochemistry and the determination of anti-insulin antibodies (A IA) and assessments of effects on weight. 
PK of insulin glargine 100 U/mL and metabolites were evaluated in adults (study TDR11626) and 
in children 1–6 years of age (EFC11202, PRESCHOOL) with T1DM. The principal pharmacologically active entity in serum was the insulin glargine metabolite M1 in both populations. Insulin glargine pare nt compound and metabolite M2 C
trough were below limit of 
quantification (<0.2 ng/mL) in the vast majority of patients. No PK data ex ists on insulin glargine 
HOE901-U300 in pediatrics and adolescents 6 to  18 years of age. In this study, serum 
concentration of insulin glargine and its metabolites M1 and M2 will be determined at various

course of accumulation and the me tabolism of insulin glargine given as HOE901-U300 or Lantus. 
The blood samples will be taken af ter the end of titration phase , during the period from visit 13, 
week 20 to visit 14, week 26) from all participan ts who provided consent for PK data collection. 
The study consists of a 2-week screening period and a treatment period of 6 months, followed by 
a comparative on-treatment 6-month safety extens ion period and a 4-week post-treatment follow-
up period.  
HOE901-U300 or Lantus will be injected subcutaneous ly once daily, either in the morning or in 
the evening. Efforts will be made to maintain the same dosing time (hh:mm) during the whole 
treatment period so that the interval between once daily injections of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be kept at or close to 24 hours.  Patients will continue w ith their mealtime fast-
acting insulin analogue.  
During the 6-month treatment period the basal insulin dose will be titrated using a titration 
schedule to reach the target fasting/pre-prandial  plasma glucose in the range of 90 to 130 mg/dL 
(5.0 to 7.2 mmol/L), bedtime / nocturnal plasma  glucose in the target range of 90–150 mg/dL 
(5.0 and 8.3 mmol/L) ( 6), avoiding hypoglycemia. Mealtime insulin will be adjusted to achieve a 
target 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose <180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L). After reaching the target 
range, the insulin dose will be adjusted depending on the prevailing plasma glucose to maintain the glycemic control over the remaining study duration. Patients will be encouraged to measure 
and record frequent SMPG values on a daily basis at different times of the day and in line with 
recommendations by the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) ( 1). 
Patients will be instructed to measure and record their blood ketones if SMPG is ≥252 mg/dL 
(≥14 mmol/L) while being unwell (eg, feeling sick or nauseated) or when persistent blood glucose 
values ≥ 252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) without substantial decline are present over a period of 
approximately 60-120 min after an extra dose of rapid-acting insulin analogue, or during 
illness with fever and/or vomiting. Ketone readings 1.5 mmol/ L or more and concomitant 
SMPG ≥252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) will be considered as  alert for development of diabetic 
ketoacidosis and the investigator will be contacted immediately. Patients who have completed the 
6-month treatment period will continue their study treatment during the 6-month comparative 
safety extension period to evaluate long-t erm safety and maintenance of efficacy. 
After end of study treatment (Month 12) patients will be monitored after switch-back to 
commercial basal insulin during the 4-week post-treatment follow up period. Patients who 
prematurely and permanently discontinue study treatment will be asked to continue attending study visits and undergo assessments according to the schedule until the planned end of study 
treatment (Month 12). For patients who prematurely and permanentl y discontinue study treatment 
during the main 6-month treatment period, as a minimum visit at Week 26/Visit 14 (assessments 
of primary and secondary efficacy  endpoints) should be conducted. 
The number of visits to the study site (7 out of 20 visits planned) is kept at a minimum in order to 
minimize the impact on the daily activities of the adolescents and their caregivers. Instead, monitoring of glycemic control including sel f-monitored plasma glucose, hypoglycemia events, 
titration of the basal insulin, dos ing of study and mealtime insulin  is done during phone-call visits. 
If deemed necessary by the investigator or by th e patient/caregiver, on-site visits may be arranged 
any time.

(HOE901-U300 or Lantus) or NIMP (fast-acting in sulin analogue). Injection site reactions 
associated with administration of the IMP or NIMP, if any, will be reported as Adverse Events 
(see Section  10.4.1 and Section  10.6.3) and information on localiza tion and insulin (IMP or 
NIMP) is required. 
The IMP will be administered once daily either in the morning or in the evening. It is expected 
that patients taking their pre-study basal insulin once daily in the morning will continue with the morning regimen of the IMP during the study as well as patients taking their pre-study basal insulin once daily in the evening will continue with the evening regimen. At Visit 3 (baseline) patients receiving more than 1 daily injection of basal insulin will change to once daily injection either in the morning or in the evening, at the discretion of the patient/parent/investigator. Once fixed at randomization, the time of da y of injection with the IMP (ie, either in the morning or in 
the evening) will remain the same throughout the whole study treatment duration. Efforts will be made to maintain the same dosing time (hh:mm) during the whole treatment period so that the 
interval between once daily injections of the IMP will be kept at or clos e to 24 hours. Patients will 
continue with their mealtime fast-acting insulin analogue which is not to be changed during the 
study (see Section  8.2).  
8.1.4 Starting dose 
The median (ie, the middle value out of the three values) of the total daily basal insulin doses in the last 3 days prior to the baseline visit will be used for the calculation of the starting dose. With 
the exception of those on more than once daily basal insulin products (eg, NPH insulin, insulin detemir), patients will sw itch 1:1 (Unit for Unit) from their daily basal insulin dose to HOE901-
U300 or Lantus.  In patients who switch from mo re than once daily basal insulin products, the 
starting dose of HOE901-U300 or Lantus (U) shou ld be reduced by a pproximately 20%.  If 
deemed necessary by the investigator the first dos e of the IMP may be administered at a reduced 
dose. See also Section  10.1.2.1 
8.1.5 Dose adjustment 
Doses of HOE901-U300 and Lantus w ill be titrated to achieve glyce mic targets of fasting SMPG 
without hypoglycemia. 
The same dosing schedule will be  applied for Lantus and HOE901- U300. Changes in the Lantus 
or HOE901-U300 dose are based on fasting SMPG m easurements using the glucometer provided 
for this study according to the following schedule (Table 1 ). Other pre-prandial (pre-lunch, pre-
dinner) SMPG measurements will be taken into account, too.

Good clinical judgment is to be exercised while titrating the basal insulin dose. Adjustment of the 
basal insulin dose should be done once per week. 
When implementing the insulin titration dose, a dose increase may be split into 2 incremental dose 
steps every 3-4 days, rather than implementing the entire dose increase at one time, if it was 
concluded by the investigator or medically qualified designee to be in the best interest of the 
patient to do so. Dose titrati on should be done no more frequently than every 3-4 days. 
The dose of Lantus or HOE901-U300 will be increas ed until the patient reaches the target fasting 
SMPG. Best efforts should be made to complete up-titration of either basal insulin by 6 to 
12 weeks. Thereafter, until the end of the study, th e dose will be adjusted as necessary to maintain 
the glycemic control.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 36  It is recommended to attain and maintain bedtime and nocturnal plasma glucose in the target 
range of 90 to 150 mg/dL (5.0 to 8.3 mmol/L), avoiding hypoglycemia. 
If needed, additional unscheduled contacts (phone, on-site visit) should be  made available for 
patients/parents to discuss dose adjustments in-between the scheduled visits already outlined in 
the protocol. 
Additionally, adherence to the titr ation rules will be monitored by  the sponsor. Non-compliance to 
the titration schedule will be raised to the attention of the investigator for explanation or 
correction. If applicable, reasons justifying deviations from the protocol-defined schedule 
(eg, temporarily increased glycemic target due  to hypoglycemia unawa reness) have to be 
documented in the patient’s file. 
Fasting SMPG will be measured by the patient/parent before breakfast or any administration of 
insulin. 
Patients who experienced a non-severe hypoglycemia  as a result of inadequate calculation of dose 
of mealtime insulin analogue against the carbohydrate content of a meal or due to a missed meal, 
unusual exercise or alcohol use will not have th eir insulin glargine (IMP) dose decreased and 
whenever appropriate will be counseled on the correction of those behaviors. 
It may be prudent to temporarily increase glyc emic targets for a patient if, for example, 
hypoglycemia unawareness or fre quent episodes of hypoglycemia occur. In such situation new 
targets and the rationale behind should be documented in the patient file. 
Sound clinical judgment is to be exercised while  titrating doses of the IMP. Investigators may 
adjust or stop titration, or tem porarily reduce dose if they belie ve further titration would be 
hazardous at that time; however, the rationale of deviating from the adjustment schedule should 
be documented in the patient file. Patients and/or parents will be familiarized with the titration schedule so that they will be able to 
monitor and comply with the titration with the assistance of the investigator or medically qualified 
designee. During contacts (phone or on-site visits) with the study site, all dose adjustments should 
be discussed between the patie nt (and/or parent) and appropr iate site personnel and be 
documented in the source document. 
8.1.6 Switch-back to commercial basal insulin 
Upon discontinuation of the study tr eatment, either scheduled or pr emature, patients must resume 
treatment with commercially available basal insulin. It is suggested that patients receiving Lantus will transition to commercial 100 U/mL formulation of basal insulin at 1:1 (Unit for Unit) rate 
(total daily basal insulin dose). Since with HOE901-U300 a slightly higher dose is needed to achieve comparable levels of glycemia, the total daily dose of replacement 100 U/mL insulin 
formulation should be reduced by 20% versus the last HOE901-U300 dose in order to reduce the 
risk of hypoglycemia in the initial period post tr ansition. Further adjustments should be guided by 
SMPG and close glucose monitoring should be  ensured during the initial weeks after the 
transition.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 37  8.2 NON-INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Mandatory additional insulin therapy is a fast-acting mealtime insulin analogue (glulisine, aspart 
or lispro) which is considered a Non-Investig ational Medicina l Product (NIMP). Regular human 
insulin must not be used during the study. 
8.2.1 Dosage schedule 
Patients in both treatment groups will continue with their fast-a cting mealtime insulin analogue 
during the study. The cost of the mealtime insulin analogue may be reimbursed if not covered by health insurance and if allowed by local regulations. 
The area of injection for the fast-acting mealtime in sulin analogue should be different from that of 
IMP (insulin glargine) so that any injection site reaction can be attributed specifically either to the 
fast-acting mealtime insulin or to IMP. As with IMP, site of mealtime insulin injections will be rotated within the injection area and areas will be changed periodically. Injection site reactions associated with administration of the IMP or NIMP, if any, will be reported as Adverse Events (see Section  10.4.1 and Section  10.6.3) and information on localiza tion and insulin (IMP or 
NIMP) is required. 
8.2.2 Starting dose 
At baseline, when changing over from the pre-study basal insulin to the study basal insulin, doses of the fast-acting mealtime insulin analogue may remain the same.  
8.2.3 Dose adjustment 
Titration of mealtime insulin will occur at the investigator’s discretion informed by instructions in the national product labe l and under consideration of the fo llowing general guidance, while 
avoiding hypoglycemia: 
• While basal insulin doses are increased, fast- acting insulin doses may be reduced to avoid 
hypoglycemia particularly during daytime. The need for corrective doses may also be reduced. 
• The dose of the mealtime insulin analogue (glulisine, lispro or aspart) is to be titrated 
based on SMPG data, including 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose results and the size or 
carbohydrate content of the meal. A scheme cons istent with local guidelines and practices 
may be applied, eg, carbohydrate counting a nd a correction/supplemen tal scale for glucose 
out of goal range based on pre-meal SMPG. The scheme will be documented in the 
patient’s file. 
• The titration goal is a 2-hour postprandial  SMPG of <180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) while 
avoiding hypoglycemia. For the purpose of th is protocol, 2 hours postprandial is defined 
as 2 hours after the start of the meal. If clin ically indicated and if in line with local 
treatment guidelines, other individual goal fo r postprandial SMPG may be determined for 
a given patient; such individual goal needs to  be documented in the patient’s file.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 38  The injection of the fast-acting mealtime insulin  analogue in relation to meals will be done 
according to the individual habits of the patient, preferably prior to meal or snack. Occasional 
postprandial injection soon after me al intake may be done if deemed  necessary and if allowed by 
the national product label. 
Dietary modifications (eg, snacks) will be made by the investigator, dietician or other medically 
qualified person based on his/her best judgment. 
After the end of the study treatment, doses of mealtime insulin may remain similar, however, if the study drug is replaced by NPH insulin, the potential for additive effects (eg, between morning NPH and lunchtime mealtime insulin) due to the peaked kinetics of the NPH, need to be taken into account. 
8.3 TITRATION OVERVIEW AND EVALUATION OF PATIENTS NOT MEETING GLYCEMIC 
GOALS 
The progress of titration will be regularly asse ssed by the sponsor personnel supported by a 
dedicated web-based tool, taking into account  SMPG, insulin doses and hypoglycemia events 
which have been documented in the diary by the patients. Observed deviations from the titration schedule or unexpected trends will be communica ted to the investigator. In addition, a central 
laboratory alert is set up to inform about inad equate glycemic contro l in terms of HbA1c 
exceeding the predefined level. The threshold value of HbA1c is defined as 8.5% from Visit 11 (Week 12) onwards. 
In case of HbA1c above the target values and/or SMPG are not improving as expected in spite of 
successive IMP dose titration, the investigator should  ensure that no reasonable explanation exists 
for insufficient glucose contro l and in particular that: 
• Pre-breakfast SMPG was actually measured in fasting condition (ie, after at least 8 hours 
fasting) 
• SMPG are correctly categorized in the diary 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate: 
- IMP dose is adjusted according to the dosing schedule  
- NIMP dose is properly adjusted, including correction doses for pre-prandial glucose 
values above goal 
• There is no inter-current disease which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infectious 
disease) 
• Compliance to diet and lifestyle is appropr iate, in particular, dosage adjustment for 
changes in carbohydrate content of the meal and SMPG

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 39  • If any of the above can reasonably explai n the insufficient glycemic control, the 
investigator should undertak e appropriate action, ie,: 
- Titrate the dose of IMP and/or NIMP 
- Set up adequate investigation and treatment of inter-curre nt disease (to be reported 
in adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE)/concomitant medication parts of 
the e-CRF, 
- Stress the absolute need to be compliant to treatment, including the importance of 
consistency in meals and insulin dosing, particularly during this time of poor glycemic control, and compliance to lifestyle recommendations, 
- Consider additional monitoring of night time glucose, 
- Organize a specific interview with a specialist pediatric dietitian (or healthcare professional with docum ented experience in childhood diabetes) in particular with 
attention to awareness of the carbohydrate content of the meal and covering snacks with a dose of fast-actin g mealtime insulin analogue, 
- Schedule HbA1c assessment at the next visit. 
8.4 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
Administration of all forms of insulin during the trial is to be open-label, and no attempt will be made to blind administration to investigators, patients and spons or’s and/or Clinical Research 
Organization local monitoring teams and auditors. 
Despite the open-label administration of study in sulin, assessment of outcomes, where possible, 
will be based on objectively collected data, whic h are assessments for HbA1c (primary endpoint) 
and FPG by a central laboratory blinded to study treatment groups.  
The global sponsor study team will remain blinded with regards to the treatment arm of individual 
patients throughout the study (eg, patient’s or cumulative tables or listings [such as AE or SAE 
listings] rendered accessible to facilitate data review will not bear study treatment identification). The members of the blinded endpoi nt assessment committee will review  data in a blinded manner. 
Personnel involved in medical review  of individual patient s’ data will have acc ess to the treatment 
arm of patients whose events warranted CIOMS generation since CIOMS reports will include study treatment identification. 
8.5 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
Patients are randomized to receive during the 6- month treatment period and also during the  
6-month extension period either HOE901-U300 or Lantus once daily in an open-label manner. The randomization ratio is 1:1. The randomiza tion is stratified by HbA1c at screening 
(<8.5 versus ≥8.5%) and by age group at screening (<12 years versus ≥12 years).  
Inclusion in the study is configured to ensure at  least 30% of participants in the age range below 
12 years. The randomized treatment kit number list is  generated centrally by Sanofi. The IMPs are

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 40  packaged in accordance with this list. The Trial Supply Operations  Manager provides the 
treatment kit number list, and the Study Bios tatistician provides the randomization scheme 
(including stratification) to the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) / Interactive Web 
Response System (IWRS). Then, the IVRS/IWR S generates the patient randomization list 
according to which it allocates treatment groups to the patients. 
The IMPs (HOE901-U300 or Lantus) are provided in open-label boxes a nd are identified with 
treatment kit numbers. At the screening visit the investigator or designee has to contact the IVRS/IWRS center to receive 
the patient number. The patient identification (patient number) is  composed of 12-digit number 
containing the 3-digit country code, the 4-digit center code and the 5-dig it patient chronological 
number. If a patient who had prev iously failed screening is approached for re-screening, a new 
informed consent form must be signed by the pa rent (and assent obtained from the patient).  In 
such case, a new patient number will be assigned by IWRS/IVRS. 
On Visit 3 (Day 1), the IVRS/IWRS is contacted  for randomization and for the first treatment 
kit(s) allocation. For each rando mized patient, the IVRS/IWRS will allocate a treatment kit using 
their treatment kit number and a quantity of kit(s)  to be dispensed corresponding to the same 
treatment group as assigned at randomization. After Visit 3 (Day 1) the IVRS/IWRS is contacted 
again each time a new treatment kit(s) allocation is necessary that is at Visit 11 (Week 12), at 
Visit 13 (Week 20), at Visit 14 (Week 26) and at Visit 16 (Week 38). IVRS/IWRS will be again contacted at Visit 18 (Week 52 or early disconti nuation) for notification of the end of study 
treatment. 
A randomized patient is defined as  a patient who has been allocated  to a randomized treatment by 
the IVRS/IWRS regardless whether the treatment kit was used or not. A patient cannot be 
randomized more than once in the study. A patient who needs to be moved to another site will 
have his/her randomization numbe r assigned at the new site. 
8.6 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
The respective number of the study treatment will  be packaged under the responsibility of Sanofi 
according to good manufacturing practice and lo cal regulatory requirement. Lantus will be 
supplied in boxes of 2 disposable pens for insulin glargine 100 U/mL and HOE901-U300 will be 
supplied in boxes of 2 disposable pens for insulin glargine 300 U/mL. 
The appropriate number of kits will be dispensed to cover up to the next dispensing visit. Storage 
conditions and use-by-end date are part of the label text. 
Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in accordance with the local regulatory specifica tions and requirements. Treatment labels will 
indicate the treatment number used for treatment  allocation. The patient number, visit number and 
box number will be entered manually by the site staff on the treatment box label prior to dispensing.

procedures. 
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperatur e (eg, refrigerated storage) and 
information on in-use stability and instructi ons for handling the Sanofi compound should be 
managed according to the rules provided by the S ponsor and are provided to study participants in 
the instruction for use leaflet together with the IMP injection pens. The expiry date is mentioned on the IMPs labels, and storage conditions are written on the IMPs 
labels and in the instruction leaflet. 
8.8 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or othe r personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordan ce with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the investigator's prescription and it is the 
investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling,  expiration date, etc.) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be reco rded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the Sponsor, in order to r ecall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by this clinical tria l protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.8.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Returned and dispensed IMP will be documented into the Treatment Log Form. Investigator or 
delegate has to visually check the filling status of the cartridges in the pens in the returned packs and compare to dosing records documented in the patients’ diaries. Disc repancies have to be 
addressed to the patient for clar ification of real treatment administration. The investigator or 
designee completes the appropriate  treatment log form based on th e unused, used and in-use IMP 
(study drug pens) returned. 
The monitor will check the e-CRF data by comparing them with patient’s diary entries, treatment 
log forms and unused treatment kits.

Patients have to return all the used, in-use and unused IMP at ea ch on-site visit including final 
assessment on-treatment visit (Visit 18 - either sc heduled at Week 52 or in case of permanent 
premature discontinuation) (see Section  1.2). 
All partially used and unused tr eatments will be retrie ved by the Sponsor. A detailed treatment log 
of the returned IMP will be established with the investigator (or the pharmacist) and countersigned by the investigator and the Monitoring Team. The investigator will not destroy any IMP unless the Sponsor provides written authorization. 
8.9 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment, including vaccines, received by the patient concomitantly to the IMP. 
Treatments in addition to the st udy treatment and NIMP should be kept to a minimum during the 
study. However, if these are considered necessary for the patient’s welfare and are unlikely to 
interfere with the IMP, they may be given at the discretion of the investigator, with a stable dose 
(when possible). 
Any treatments, which are continued during the study and/or initiated or changed during the study, 
must be recorded in source data and in the e-CRF.

Blood samples for FPG measurement are taken at ba seline (Visit 3; Day 1), at Visit 14 (Week 26), 
and at End of treatment Visit 18 (Week 52 and, if  applicable, early trea tment discontinuation). 
9.1.2.2 Self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) 
Glucose meter, patient diary and training  
All the patients/parents are supplie d with a glucose meter, the corresponding supplies (lancets, test 
strips, control solution, etc.) and with diaries at  Visit 1 (Week -2) in order to perform self-
measurement of plasma glucose, reporting hypo glycemic symptoms and record IMP/NIMP doses. 
It is recommended to perform tests with the contro l solution before first use of the study glucose 
meter, in cases when SMPG reading is considered incorrect or inconsistent with symptoms and 
whenever a new batch of test strips is used. If SMPG ≥252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) is measured, 
measurement of blood ketones may be needed, please see detailed instructions in Section  10.6.2. 
During the study, all SMPG have to be done using the sponsor-provided glucose meter. The 
readings are to be transferred to the diary. 
Patients/parents will be instructed on the proper use of the glucose meter and the diary including 
education around hypoglycemia symptoms (see Section  9.2.1) and management  
(see Section  10.6.1) at screening (Visit 1, Week-2); at baseline (Visit 3; Day 1) and the training

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 46  will be repeated as often as necessary at the st udy visits. The diary, blood glucose meter and blood 
ketone meter need to be brought to the study site at each on-site visit. 
SMPG measurements include the following: 
Fasting SMPG 
The fasting (pre-breakfast) SMPG will be measured  on at least 5 days in the week before each 
visit. It is recommended to perform fasting SMPG daily throughout the study. When up-titration 
has been completed and fasting (pre-breakfast) SMPG  is stable in the target range, the number of 
fasting SMPG checks can be reduced according to  the investigator’s judgment, however at least 
3 fasting (pre-breakfast) SMPG measurem ents per week should be performed.  
During the screening period compliance to the fasting SMPG measurement schedule will be used to assess eligibility for entry in the randomized treatment period.   
8-point SMPG Profiles 
Eight-point blood glucose profiles should be measured at the following 8 time-points: between 
01:00 and 04:00 AM at night; before and 2 hours af ter breakfast; before and 2 hours after lunch; 
before and 2 hours after dinner; at bedtime). Two hours post meal is defined as 2 hours after the 
start of the meal. 
Patients are required to have 8- point SMPG profiles performed on at least one day in the week 
before the baseline visit, and the visits week 26 and week 52 (end of treatment). Special attention 
should be paid that the nighttime SMPG valu e (between 01:00 and 04:00 AM) is recorded. 
On days when 8-point profiles are done, fasting SMPG will be considered as the second point of 
measurement, ie, “before breakfast” time point after the first point measurement at 01:00 – 04:00 
AM at night.  
SMPG during episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Whenever the patient feels hypoglycemic symptoms, plasma glucose should be measured by the 
patient/parent (or others, if app licable), if possible. Patients/pa rents should be instructed to 
measure plasma glucose levels prior to the ad ministration of glucose or carbohydrate intake 
whenever symptomatic hypoglycemia is suspected (see Section  10.6.1), unless safety 
considerations necessitate imme diate glucose/carbohydrate re scue prior to confirmation.  
Complementary SMPG 
Patients are encouraged to conti nue with their usual pattern of SMPG measurements on top of 
protocol-mandated profiles. It is recommended to perform 4-6 SMPG daily at different times of 
the day and measure the nighttime SMPG once weekly for optimal control of glycemia and adjustment of the insulin regimen. Additional SMPG are recommended in association with exercise (before start of exercise, when need arises during exercise, after exercise and at bedtime) 
and, if deemed appropriate by the inve stigator, at sick days or menses ( 1, 7).

9.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS  
The safety endpoints to be assessed are:  
• Hypoglycemia (see Section  9.2.1), 
• Hyperglycemia with ketosis (see Section  9.2.2) 
• AEs (including injection site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions), SAEs and Adverse 
event of special interest (AESI) (see Section  10.4.1), 
• Safety laboratory values (see Section  9.2.4), 
• Anti-insulin Antibodies (AIA) (see Section  9.2.8), 
• Physical examination (see Section  9.2.5),

• The pre-treatment period is defined as the time between the date of the informed consent 
and the first injecti on of open-label IMP, 
• The main 6-month TEAE period is defined as the time from the first injection of open-label IMP up to Month 6/ Week 26 (visit 14) or up to 2 days after the last injection of IMP, 
whichever comes earlier, 
• The 12-month TEAE period is defined as the time from the first injection of open-label IMP up to 2 days after the last injection of IMP,

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 48  9.2.1 Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemia events will be categorized as follows using the criteria published by the ADA ( 4, 5) 
and ISPAD (1):  
• Severe hypoglycemia 
Severe hypoglycemia is define d as the child/adolescent having  altered mental status and 
cannot assist in their care, is semiconscious or unconscious, or in coma ± convulsions and 
may require parenteral therapy (glucagon or glucose) ( 8). 
Note that “cannot assist in their care” means th at the severity of symptoms prevents self-
treatment by a child/adolescent who is otherwis e capable of managing his or her episodes 
of hypoglycemia. Assisting a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not required, 
should not be considered a “s evere hypoglycemia” incident. 
Plasma glucose concentrations may not be av ailable during an event, but neurological 
recovery following the return of plasma gl ucose to normal is considered sufficient 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. 
Any hypoglycemic event which leads to unc onsciousness, coma, or seizure must be 
reported as an SAE.  In addition, any hypoglycemic event, which at investigator discretion, 
qualifies as serious adverse event must also be reported as an SAE. 
• Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which typical symptoms of 
hypoglycemia are accompanied by a meas ured plasma glucose concentration of 
≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
Clinical symptoms that are considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode could be: cold sweatiness, pallor, pounding heart, tremor/trembling, headache, nausea, difficulty 
concentrating, blurred or altered vision, slurred speech, difficulty hearing, unsteady gait, 
altered judgment and confusi on, irritability, erratic behavior, nightmares, inconsolable 
crying, seizures, unconsciousness, coma. 
• Asymptomatic hypoglycemia 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia is an event not accompanied by typical symptoms of 
hypoglycemia but with a measured plasma gl ucose concentration le ss than or equal to 
70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L); 
• Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia 
are not accompanied by a plasma glucose dete rmination, but was presumably caused by a 
plasma glucose concentration less than or  equal to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L); symptoms 
treated with oral carbohydrate w ithout a test of plasma glucose.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 49  • Pseudo-hypoglycemia 
Pseudo-hypoglycemia is an event during which the child/adolescent with diabetes reports 
any of the typical symptoms of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma glucose concentration greater than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L); symptoms are relieved with a 
countermeasure. 
In addition the composite category of severe and/or documented (SMPG <54 mg/dL; 
3.0 mmol/L and ≤70 mg/dL; 3.9 mmol/L) symptomatic hypoglycemia will be presented. 
All documented hypoglycemia categories will be also evaluated for the more stringent 
SMPG threshold of <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L). De tails of all hypoglyc emia events will be 
reported on dedicated e-CRF pages. 
Instructions on hypoglycemia collecting and reporting are described in Section  10.6.1. 
All hypoglycemia events reporte d by investigator as severe  and/or reported as serious 
adverse events will be independently reviewed by an external expert pediatrician 
specialized in diabetology blinded to treatment arm (see Section  9.2.9). 
9.2.2 Hyperglycemia with ketosis 
If SMPG is ≥252 mg/dL ( ≥14 mmol/L) in an unwell child (eg, feeling sick or nauseated) or when 
persistent blood glucose values ≥252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) without substantial decline are present 
over a period of approximately 60-120 min after an extra dose of rapid-acting insulin analogue, or 
when a patient is ill with fever and/or vomiting, capillary blood ke tones will be measured using a 
meter provided by the sponsor. Hyperglycemia with  ketosis is defined as self-measured plasma 
glucose ≥252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) with accompanying self-measured blood ketones ≥1.5 mmol/L. 
Instructions on collecting and reporting events of  hyperglycemia with ketosis are described in 
Section  10.6.2. 
9.2.3 Adverse events 
Adverse events, serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be collected from the time of informed consent signature and then at each visit until the end of the study.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 50  9.2.4 Laboratory safety variables 
The clinical laboratory data consist of blood analysis (including hematology , clinical chemistry) 
and urinalysis. Samples will be collected for central laboratory in accordance with the study 
schedule and values will be analyzed after conversion into standard international units.  
The following laboratory safety variables will be analyzed: 
• Hematology: erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hema tocrit, leukocytes, differential blood count 
(neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils , basophils) and platelets at screening 
(Visit 1, Week -2); Visit 14 (Week 26) and End of treatment Visit 18 (Week 52 and, if 
applicable, early trea tment discontinuation); 
• Clinical chemistry: total bilirubin (in cas e of values above the normal range, 
differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin), AST (Aspartate 
aminotransferase), ALT (Ala nine aminotransferase), ALP (Alkaline phosphatase ), 
creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Schwartz equation) (9), sodium, 
potassium, calcium, chloride at screening (Visit 1, Week -2); Visit 14 (Week 26) and End 
of treatment Visit 18 (Week 52 and, if applicable, early treatme nt discontinuation); 
• C-peptide (Visit 3, Day 1); 
• Urine (for analysis including pH, glucose, ketones, leucocytes, blood/hemoglobin, protein) 
will be collected at screening (Visit 1, Week -2) and End of treatment Visit 18 (Week 52 
and, if applicable, early treatment discontinuation); 
• Urine albumin/creatinine ratio assessment and microalbuminuria (to be done on first 
morning urine sample) will be performed at baseline (Visit 3, Day 1); 
• Serum pregnancy test (at screening [Visit 1, Week -2]) and urine pregnancy test (at study site; each onsite visit thereafter) in post-menarchal girls; 
• In addition, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C vira l antibodies (HCAb) 
(and reflex test for Hepatitis C virus RNA in case of positive HCAb) laboratory data will 
also be collected only at screening visit (Visit 1, Week -2) for identifying patients with exclusion criteria or safety consideration. 
Note: Any abnormal laboratory value estimated as clinically sign ificant by the investigator should 
be immediately rechecked (whenever possible using the central laboratory) for confirmation before making a decision of permanent discon tinuation of IMP for the concerned patient. Any 
confirmed laboratory abnormality estimated as clinically significant by the investigator must be reported as an AE/SAE as applicable. Please also refer to Section  10.4.1.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 51  9.2.5 Physical examination and Tanner puberty stage 
Physical examination is performed at screening (V isit 1, Week -2); at baseline (Visit 3, Day 1), at 
Visit 14 (Week 26) and at End of treatment Vis it 18 (Week 52 and, if app licable, early treatment 
discontinuation). The date of menarche will be captured if applicable.  
Tanner puberty stage is assessed at baseline (V isit 3, Day 1), Visit 14 (Week 26) and Visit 18 
(Week 52 [and at early treatment discontinuation vi sit if the previous assessment did not occur 
within the previous 3 months]) (see Section  1.2). Once the adult stage is determined, defined by 
Tanner stage 5 (see Appendix A ), no further assessments will be performed. 
9.2.6 Body Weight and Height 
The same scale should be used throughout the study, and calibrated on a regular basis as 
recommended by the manufacturer. 
Body weight should be obtained with the patient wearing undergarments or very light clothing 
and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The floor surface on which the scale rests must be hard and should not be carpeted or covere d with other soft material. The we ight is read and recorded in 
the e-CRF and Source Data. Self-reported weights are not acceptable; patients/parents must not read the scales themselves. 
Body weight is measured at screening (Visit 1, Week -2), baseline (Visit 3, Day 1), Visit 11 
(Week 12), Visit 14 (Week 26), Visit 16 (Week 38 ) and End of treatment Visit 18 (Week 52 and, 
if applicable, early treatment disc ontinuation). Height is measured at screening (Visit 1, Week -2), 
at Visit 11 (Week 12), Visit 14 (Week 26), Vis it 16 (Week 38) and End of treatment Visit 18 
(Week 52 and, if applicable, ear ly treatment discontinuation). Body mass index (BMI) will be 
determined based on bod y weight and height. 
9.2.7 Vital signs 
Vital signs include: systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) a nd heart rate (beats per minute: 
bpm). They are assessed at screening (Visit 1, Week- 2) and at each on-site visit thereafter 
(see Section 1.2). Blood pressure (mmHg) should be meas ured on right arm when the patient has 
been sitting quietly for 5 minutes, and is seated wi th his or her back supported, feet on the floor 
and right arm supported, cubital fossa at heart level. Measurement should be taken under 
standardized conditions, approximately at the same time of the day, with the same device (regularly recalibrated according to manufacturers´ instructions) using the cuff appropriate to the 
size of the patient’s upper right arm and the values are to be recorded in the e-CRF. Both systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressu re (DBP) should be recorded. The preferred 
method of blood pressure measurement is auscultation. 
Heart rate (bpm) will be measured at the time of the measurement of blood pressure and also is to 
be reported in the e-CRF.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 52  9.2.8 Immunogenicity 
Anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) will be determined at  a centralized laboratory using a validated anti-
insulin antibody immunogenicity assay.  
Blood samples for immunogenicity tests will be co llected prior the first administration of 
HOE901-U300 or Lantus (during the baseline visit [Visit 3]) and at Visit 11 (Week 12), Visit 14 
(Week 26) and End of treatment Visit 18 (W eek 52 and, if applicable, early treatment 
discontinuation). The samples should be taken prior to administration of the basal insulin 
(applicable to patients who have their basal insulin injection in the morning) and at least four hours after last dosing of the fast -acting mealtime insulin analogue (insulin glulisin, insulin lispro, 
insulin aspart). 
Detailed procedure of sample prep aration, storage and shipment will be described in  the specific 
laboratory manual. Two (2.0) ml blood volume is to  be collected for each anti-insulin antibody 
sample. The AIA endpoints will be detailed in  the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
9.2.9 Blinded external endpoint assessment committee 
Ongoing safety surveillance will be performed  by a blinded external endpoint assessment 
committee consisting of experts in pediatric diabetology and endocrinology:  
• The ISPAD definition of severe hypoglycemia is broad and includes a subjective element: 
‘The child has altered mental status and cannot assist in his own care’, and determining 
whether an episode fulfils the definition can be  challenging, especially in young children. 
Therefore, all reported episodes of severe hypoglycemia will be reviewed in a blinded 
manner by the external safety monitoring group, in order to determine whether the episodes fulfilled the criteria for severe hypoglycemia. For this purpose the experts will be provided on a regular basis with a tabulated overview of hypoglycemia events. 
To monitor general safety of the study participants, the committee will be provided on a regular basis with tabulated overvie ws of TEAEs, serious TEAEs. 
The committee will also assess the antigenicity data (AIA data and potential clinical correlates [hypersensitivity events, indicators of insulin-resistance]).

9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics sparse sampling 
The concentration of Insulin glargine and its metabolites (M1 and M2) in plasma will be 
measured using a validated LC-MS (Liquid Chromatograph Ion Spray Mass Spectroscopy) assay 
with an LLOQ (Lower Limit of Quantitation) of  0.2 ng/mL. One (1) mL of blood should be 
collected at each PK sampling time according to the below schedule. 
PK sparse sampling will be proposed  to all randomized patients and w ill be collected over a single 
day in those participants who consent to this assessment after the end of titration phase during the 
period when only minor adjustments of the basal insulin dose are done to maintain the glycemic 
control (ie, no sooner than at Visit 13, Week 20, but no later than at Visit 14, Week 26,). All 
participants who provided an asse nt and whose parents signed the specific informed consent form 
(see Section  12.2), will provide 3 blood samples.  Patients will be offered to  stay at the study site 
throughout the day when the procedure is performe d and meals will be provided to patients. The 
day of the PK sparse sampling procedure within  the authorized window will be agreed between 
patient/parent and investigator. The sample times will depend on the existing basal insulin dosing regimen: 
• Patients with IMP dose administered in the evening (~8:00 PM) on the day before the date 
of the visit: patients can have breakfast (including mealtime insulin injection) at home and 
come to the study site in the morning to have blood samplings at around 8:00AM, 12:00 PM, 04:00 PM (what corresponds with samplings  12 h, 16 h and 20 h after the last basal 
insulin injection). Sample times can be within ±1 h. 
• Patients with IMP dose administered in the morning (~8:00 AM) on the day of the visit: 
patients will come to the study site in the mo rning in fasting condition not having injected 
their basal and mealtime insu lin to have blood samplings at around 8:00AM, 12:00 PM, 
04:00 PM (what corresponds with pre-dose sampling [to be done within 1 h before time of 
dosing] and 4 h and 8 h post dose sampling). Sample times can be within ±1 h. 
9.4 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is change of HbA1c from baseline to endpoint 
(Week 26/Month 6). HbA1c reflects the average glycemia over 2-3 months and has strong 
predictive value for diabetes complications. It is a ccepted by regulatory agencies as an appropriate 
primary endpoint to support a cla im based on glycemic control. Twenty six weeks duration of 
study treatment is considered to be sufficien t for achieving steady state conditions with  
HOE901-U300 or Lantus enabling an adequate a ssessment of time-dependent changes in HbA1c 
and the concomitant risk of hypoglycemia. 
Analysis of responders (HbA1c) is set up to compar e both formulations in te rms of rate of patients 
achieving and/or maintaining optimal long-term glucose contro l confirmed by target HbA1c 
<7.5% at month 6 overall as well as not comp romised by severe and or documented  
(SMPG <54 mg/dL; 3.0 mmol/L) symptomatic hypoglyce mia during the last 3 months of the main 
6-month treatment period.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 54  Fasting plasma glucose (FPG): change from baseline to Month 6/Week 26 and rate (%) of patients 
reaching target FPG at month 6 without hypoglyc emia. Change in FPG is an acceptable secondary 
efficacy endpoint by regulatory agencies.    
Studies have demonstrated that  frequent SMPG measurements correlate with decreased HbA1c. 
Thus it is recommended that regardless of mand atory SMPG measurements patients regularly 
perform 4-6 SMPG at different times of the day ( 7). 
Incidence of patients with nocturnal hypoglycemia: one of the limiting factors in achieving 
desired glycemic control in patients treated with insulins, including basal insulins, is a risk of hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal hypoglycemia. Even distribution of the glucose lowering activity over the 24 hour injection intervals fo llowing once daily administration of HOE901-U300, 
as demonstrated in phase 1 studi es, is expected to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia, including  
nocturnal hypoglycemia. Lower risk of nocturna l hypoglycemia may result in better adherence to 
antidiabetic therapy and increase chances of reaching glycemia targets resulting in reduced risk / delayed onset of chronic complications of diabetes. Two nocturnal hypoglycemia categories will 
be taken into account for analysis: defined by the time of the day (between 00:00 and 05:59 a.m.) 
and defined by sleep status (waking up the patient  after going to bed in the evening and before 
getting up in the morning). 
Safety will be evaluated by standard clinical and laboratory measurements including assessment 
of parameters of interest for a gl ucose lowering injectable peptide such as injection site reactions 
and hypersensitivity reactions. A special attention will be paid to the most prominent limiting factor in achieving optimal glycemic control, ie, hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia (incidence and rate) will be assessed according to categories defined by the ADA ( 4) and ( 5). Documented 
hypoglycemia categories will be assessed using two plasma glucose thresholds: <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) and ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).  
In established T1DM the estimated incidence of DKA is 1-10% per patient per year ( 10); DKA is 
a special safety concern in th e pediatric population. Incidences of hyperglycemia with ketosis 
(defined as self-measured plasma glucose ≥252 mg/dL [14 mmol/L] with accompanying self-
measured blood ketones ≥1.5 mmol/L), which may indicate the risk of developing DKA, will be 
assessed.

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The visit schedule and comprehens ive list of procedures/assessments is presented in the “Study 
Flow Chart” in Section  1.2.  
This is an outpatient study and consists of 7 on-site visits and 13 phone -call visits. Phone-call 
visits can alternatively be performed as on-site  visits. Additional contacts (phone, on-site visit) 
will be made available fo r patients’ in-between the scheduled visits as needed. Patients should be 
accompanied by parent/legal guardian2 during each scheduled visit/contact. In case a patient does 
not show up for a visit or cannot be reached for a phone visit, the investigat or has to make three 
phone call attempts and send a certified letter in orde r to locate the patient. 
All on site visits should take place in the mornin g at approximately the sa me time. The patient has 
to be in fasting condition for the following on-site visits: Visit 3 (baseline), Visit 11 (Week 12), 
Visit 14 (Week 26) and End of treatment Visit 18  (Week 52 and, if applicable, early treatment 
discontinuation); timing of fasting on- site visits should be agreed with patients/parents to reduce 
risk of hypoglycemia and to prevent non-compliance with fasting requirements due to extension 
of fasting period if such visit is scheduled relatively late as compared to the patient’s daily routine. The fasting condition is defined as an overnight fast  of at least 8 hours that consisted of no food or 
liquid intake, other than water.  IMP and NIMP should be administered after the fasting blood 
sample is drawn for all laboratory tests at the study site at visits where such sampling is scheduled. 
Note : If the patient is not fasting at Visit 3 (bas eline), a new appointment should be given to the 
patient for the following day if possible, with instruction to be fasted. If th e patient is not fasting 
at the remaining visits specified above, the planned study procedures/assessments except 
collection of blood for central laboratory may be  performed and a new appointment should be 
given to the patient for the following day if  possible, with instruction to be fasted. 
Nutritional and lifestyle advice will be provided by a specialist pediatric dietitian (or healthcare 
professional with documented expe rience in childhood diabetes) as needed by the patients/parents 
and when deemed appropriate accordin g to the investigator’s judgment.  
Visit window: Visit 3 (baseline) will take place 14 ± 3 days after Visit 1 (screening); from Visit 4 
(Week 1) to Visit 11 (Week 12; inclusive), a timeframe of ± 3 days is acceptable and from Visit 12 (Week 16) up to Visit 18 (Week 52), a time frame of ± 5 days is acceptable using the day of Visit 3 (Day 1, baseline) as reference (if one visit date is changed, the next visit should take 
place according to the original schedule). During  the post-treatment follow-up period, for Visit 19 
(Follow-up 1 visit) a time frame of +2 day is acceptable and for Visit 20 (Follow-up 2 visit) a time

Starting from the time when the informed consent has been obtained, AEs/SAEs will be recorded 
at each visit. Hypoglycemia will also be record ed all along the study. Appropriate e-CRF pages 
(visit-specific pages and whenever applicable also non visit-specific pages such as adverse event, hypoglycemia, medication pages) need to be co mpleted during the patient’s visit or shortly 
thereafter, except SAE or AESI which have to  be reported within 24 hours. E-CRF reporting 
instructions and timelines are described in a separate document. 
10.1.1 Screening period 
Patients meeting all the inclusion criteria are candidates for the screening phase. All laboratory tests measured at a central laboratory that are needed for checking the exclusion criteria of the patients are performed at the screening Visit 1 (Week -2).  
As an exception, if any of the laboratory paramete rs required for assessment of eligibility are not 
available by the date of scheduled baseline (V3)  visit (eg, lost specime n, non-assessable sample, 
etc.), a retest can be performed and the screen ing period can be extended by one additional week. 
Patients can be re-screened one time before ra ndomization in case of non-evaluable exclusion 
criteria or in cases where original screen failure was due to reasons expected to change at 
rescreening and based upon the investigator’s clinical judgment. Re-screened patients will be subject to the screening visit procedures/assessm ents (see below) including new informed consent 
form signed and new assent obtained and allo cation of a new patient number. In case of 
adolescents who will reach the legal age of maturity during the study and are subject to transition from pediatric to adult health care, before the pa tient can be screened, the investigator has to 
ensure that the patient may continue to attend planned study vis its and undergo study procedures 
at the study site according to the protocol until the planned last study visit. 
10.1.1.1 Screening visit (Visit 1, Week - 2) 
The patient should come to the study site in the morning. 
The following procedures/assessments will be performed and recorded at this visit: 
• Informed consent/assent: 
- The patient and the parent(s) will receive ve rbal information concerning the aims and 
methods of the study, its constraints and risks and the study duration. Message to 
patients will be adapted to their individual level of co mprehension. Written 
information will be provided to the parent(s ) and, if applicable, written assent will be 
provided to the patient. Written informed consent form must be signed by the parent and investigator prior to any investigations. Written assent (when applicable) also must 
be signed by the patient and investigator prior to any investigations. Younger children for whom the written assent does not apply may only be screened if oral assent has 
been obtained in presence of an impartial witness (see Section  12.2).

(Visit 3). 
An appointment is given to the patient/parent for the next two visits: phone-call visit 2 (Week -1) 
and baseline visit (Day 1). The patient is to come to the study site for the baseline visit (Visit 3, 
Day 1) 14 days ± 3 days after the date of Vi sit 1 in fasting condition. The patient/parent is 
instructed to bring container with patient’s first morning urine, the glucose meter, the ketone 
meter, the diary and patient’s current anti-diabetic medications. 
10.1.1.2 Telephone visit 2 (week -1) 
Approximately one week after the screening visit the patient/parent is called by the investigator or 
qualified designee at a scheduled time. If the call has been completed by site staff other than the 
investigator, the investigator has to be consulted if AE/SAE is su spected. This visit is a mandatory 
telephone visit, but can optionally be performed as a clinical visit.  
During the phone call the following points have  to be addressed w ith the patient/parent: 
• Did you/your child experience any new medical event, disease or symptom since the last 
visit? (Please pay attention to any possible hypoglycemic event or symptom). 
• Did you/your child experience any change in a preexisting medical event or disease or symptom since the last visit? 
• Did you/your child change or add any concomitant medication since the last visit? What are the actual basal and fast-acting mealtime insulin analogue doses? 
• Do you/your child feel comfortable in handlin g the diary, glucose meter and ketone meter 
or do you need any more explanation? 
• The patient/parent is asked about fasting SM PG values and, if av ailable, other SMPG 
values from the last week (if SMPG ≥252 mg/dL [14 mmol/L] was measured when the 
child was unwell or when pers istent blood glucose values ≥ 252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) 
without substantial decline were present ove r a period of approximately 60-120 min after 
injection of an extra dose of rapid-acting insulin analogue, or when the patient was ill with 
fever and/or vomiting, check if bl ood ketones were measured, too).

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 59  Further following procedures will be performed: 
• Review of Inclusion/ Exclusion criteria. 
• If based on the glycemic data, adjustment of insulin doses is needed, the investigator 
instructs patients/parents on the new insulin doses. 
• The patients/parents are reminded to measur e required SMPG and if applicable blood 
ketones and complete the diary. 
• Diary data available in the e-CRF are reviewed (basal insulin dose, NIMP dose, SMPG 
values (see Section  9.1.2.2), hypoglycemia events, blood ketone values  
(see Section  10.6.2). 
• Change of concomitant medications is documented in the e-CRF. 
• AE/SAE if any are reported. 
Furthermore, an appointment for the baseline visit (V3, Day 1) in fasting condition at study site in 
one week is confirmed with the patient/parent. The patient/parent is reminded to bring container 
with patient’s first morning urine, the glucose meter, the ketone meter, the diary and patient’s current anti-diabetic medications. The patient/parent will be reminded not to inject any insulin in the morning of the visit.  
If a patient is found ineligible and thus considered a screen failure, the patient must not enter the 
randomized treatment phase and IV RS/IWRS has to be contacted as soon as possible in order to 
register the patient as a screening failure. 
10.1.2 Open-label randomized treatment phase (Day 1 to Week 52) 
The open-label randomized treatment  phase consists of two periods : the main 6-month treatment 
period spanning from baseline (Visit 3 [Day 1] ) to the primary endpoint assessment (Visit 14 
[Week 26]) and the on-treatment safety extension period starting after the primary endpoint visit 
and lasting until the end of trea tment visit (Visit 18, Week 52). 
Patients meeting all inclusion criteria and with no exclusion criteria at the end of the screening period are eligible to be enrolled into the open-label randomiz ed treatment phase. 
At Visit 3 (Day 1), patients/pa rents must demonstrate competen ce in the unaided use of the 
injection device, including dose setting and the prope r use of glucose meter, ketone meter and the 
diary before randomization may occur. 
Training will be repeated as often as deemed necessary by study site staff during the treatment 
period.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 60  10.1.2.1 Baseline visit (Visit 3, Day 1) 
At this visit, the patient must return to the i nvestigation site in the morning in fasting condition. 
Patients who inject their pre-study basal insulin in  the morning (either as once daily or more than 
once daily regimen) will come to the study site without having injected the morning dose of basal 
insulin. 
Patients accompanied by parent will come with the blood glucose mete r, ketone meter, the diary, 
current anti-diabetic medications and with the first-morning urine sample of the same day. The following procedures/assessments will be performed and recorded at this visit: 
• Review of all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
• Determination of the starting dose of the IMP 
• IVRS/IWRS contact 
Call IVRS/IWRS for randomization, investigati onal medicinal product st arting dose has to be 
established before contacting IVRS/IWRS (see Section  8.1.4).  
The IMP (either HOE901-U300 or Lantus) will be given at an individually titrated dose by SC 
injection once daily either in the morning or in the evening at the same time every day. It is 
expected that patients taking their pre-study basal insulin once daily in the morning will continue 
with the morning regimen of the IMP during the study as well as patients taking their pre-study basal insulin once daily in the evening will continue with the evening regimen. At Visit 3 (baseline) patients receiving more than one daily injection of their pre-study basal insulin will change to once daily injection either in the morning or in the evening, at the discretion of the patient/parent/investigator. Patients will stick with either morning or evening injections throughout the whole study treatment duration. The dosing interval between once daily injections 
of the IMP should be kept close to 24 hours as much  as possible. Patients will continue with their 
mealtime fast-acting insulin analogue which is not to be changed during the study.  
Patients switching from more than once daily ba sal insulin regimen, who wish to adopt a once 
daily evening administration schedule, will not use any basal insulin in the morning of the 
baseline visit and start HOE901-U300 or Lantus injection in the evening of the baseline visit. For those patients who wish to adopt a once dail y morning administration schedule, the first 
administration of the IMP will take place at th e end of the baseline visit, after scheduled 
laboratory samples have been drawn, at a reduced dose (approximately -20% of the calculated starting dose [see Section  8.1.4] or at the discretion of the i nvestigator) taking into account 
changeover from more than once daily to the once daily regimen with the previous injection in the evening the day before.

optionally be performed as a clinical visit. 
During the phone call, answers to the following questions are to be obtained from the 
patient/parent: 
• Did you experience any new medical event, disease or symptom since the last visit (please 
pay attention to any potential hypoglycemic events, potential allergic or injection site 
reaction)? 
• Did you experience SMPG ≥252 mg/dL [14 mmol/L] while you were unwell (eg, you felt 
sick or nauseated; you had abdominal pain ) or did you have persistent blood glucose 
values ≥ 252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) without substa ntial decline over a period of 
approximately 60-120 min after injection of an extra dose of your rapid-acting insulin 
analogue, or were you ill with fever and/or vomiting? If yes, did you measure and record the level of blood ketones? 
• Did you experience any changes in a pre-ex isting medical condition, disease or symptom 
since the last visit?

• Dietician’s notes 
• Physician’s notes, 
• Patient’s diary

10.2.1 Source data verification require ments for patients not randomized 
For patients not randomized, the source data that  must be checked include the patient's and 
parent’s identification details, the informed consent signed by the parent, written assent or 
documentation of oral assent obtained from the patie nt as applicable, the study identification, the 
dates of study visits and the main reasons preventing randomization. 
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF.  
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal products 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consider ed by the investigator because of suspected 
AEs. Re-initiation of treatment with the IMP w ill be done under close and appropriate clinical/and 
or laboratory monitoring once the investigator w ill have considered according to his/her best 
medical judgment that the responsibility of the IM P in the occurrence of the concerned event was 
unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and  
Section  7.2). 
For all temporary treatment disc ontinuations, ie, any day without IMP administration, patients are 
asked to report in their diary for IMP a dose 0 units for each of these days. Investigator will check patients´ diaries and ensure a ll days corresponding to a tempor ary treatment discontinuation are 
appropriately captured in the data base. Additionally, the investigator must record in the e-CRF 
any non-study basal insulin administered as a replacement for IMP during those periods (see Section  8.9).  
Temporary treatment (IMP) discon tinuation decided by the inves tigator corresponds to one or 
more dose not administered to the patient.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 69  10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the investigator or the patient/parent not to re-expose the patient to the 
IMP at any time. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they/their parents decide to do so, at 
any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the investigator’s decision. All efforts 
should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuati on and this should be 
documented in the e-CRF. Partic ular attention should be paid  whether or not treatment 
discontinuation was associated with an adverse event or hypoglycemia and, if applicable, 
corresponding event has to be reported in the e-CRF. 
The following will lead to permanent treatment discontinuation: 
• Patient’s own request or patient’s parent request,  ie, withdrawal of the consent for 
treatment 
• If, in the investigator's opinion, continuati on with the administration of IMP would be 
detrimental to the patient's well-being, 
• Specific request of the Sponsor. 
• Intercurrent condition that requires discon tinuation of IMP: eg, laboratory abnormalities 
(see decision tree and general guidance for the follow up of laboratory abnormalities in 
Appendix C ),  
• The need to initiate the prohibited therapy (see Section  8.9.2) 
• Pregnancy in all cases 
• If, in the investigator's opinion, a female patie nt undertakes behavior deemed to be at risk 
of getting pregnant or decides to attempt to become pregnant. 
Any abnormal laboratory value or electrocard iogram (ECG) parameter will be immediately 
rechecked for confirmation before making a deci sion of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for 
the concerned patient.  
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
As soon as possible after the premature and pe rmanent discontinuation of study treatment, the 
patients will be assessed using the procedure normally planned for the last day of the treatment period (Visit 18, Week 52, see Section  10.1.2.4). The patients will be asked to continue attending 
study visits and undergo assessments according to the schedule until the planned end of study 
treatment (Month 12), including assessments norma lly scheduled for the 4-week post-treatment 
follow up period to evaluate insulin dose after switch-back to a non-study therapy during the 
initial four weeks after change over from the study treatment. As a minimum, visit at 
Week 26/Visit 14 (assessments of primary and s econdary efficacy endpoint s) should be conducted.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 70  All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation s hould be recorded by the investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF when considered as confirmed. IVRS/IWRS will be notified when 
a patient prematurely discontinues treatment. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study   
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason. Withdrawal of  consent for treatment should be distinguished 
from withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient 
contact follow-up, eg, medical records check. Patients  and their parents will be told that they are 
free to withdraw from the study at any time without  any adverse effect on their care. However, if 
they no longer wish to take the IMP, they will be encouraged to remain in the study and attend the remaining visits or, at the minimu m, attend Visit 14 at Week 26. The value of all their study data 
collected during their continued involvement will be emphasized as important to the public health value of the study. Patients who do not wish to continue in the study after the premature and 
permanent discontinuation of stud y treatment should be  assessed as soon as possible after IMP 
discontinuation using the procedur es normally planned for the End of Treatment visit (Visit 18, 
see Section  10.1.2.4). 
All study withdrawals should be recorded by the I nvestigator in the appropriate screens of the  
e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, at least the date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who fail to return to the study site for the End of Treatment visit,  unless the patient 
withdraws the consent for follow-up, the investigator should make the best effort to re-contact the 
patient/parent (eg, contacting patie nt’s parents or other member of family whose contact details 
were collected at the beginning of the study, or private physician, reviewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to dete rmine his/her health status, includi ng at least his/her vital status. 
These contacts attempts must be  documented in the patient’s r ecords (eg, times and dates of 
attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending  a registered letter). 
Patients who withdraw (and/or thei r parents) should be explicitly asked about the contribution of 
possible AEs to their decision to withdraw cons ent, and any AE information elicited should be 
documented. Preferably the patient (and/or the pa rent) should withdraw consent in writing and, if 
the patient or the parent refuses or is physically  unavailable, the site should document and sign the 
reason for the patient’s or parent’s failure to withdraw consent in writing. All study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator in the appr opriate screens of the e- CRF and in the patient’s 
medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, at least the date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d which does not necessar ily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event 
 
Medical and scientific judgment  should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situa tions, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical or surgical in tervention (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which conditi on has to be considered as a medi cally important event. The list is 
not intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
- Development of drug de pendence or drug abuse 
- ALT >3 x ULN (upper limit of normal ra nge) + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or 
asymptomatic ALT increase >10 x ULN 
- Suicide attempt or any even t suggestive of suicidality

sampling) 
- Bullous cutaneous eruptions 
- Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study, including in-situ 
malignancies  
- Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study. 
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an  AE (serious or non-ser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, fo r which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by the investigator to th e Sponsor is required. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. 
The AESIs are listed below: 
• Symptomatic overdose with IMP/NIMP 
- A symptomatic overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event 
suspected by the investigator or spontaneous ly notified by the patie nt/parent (not based 
on systematic drug accountability) and defined as follows: 
- any IMP or fast-acting mealtime insulin analogue (NIMP) dose administration 
which, in the investigator’s opinion based on clinical judgment is considered significantly greater than the prescribed dose of insulin and which results in symptomatic hypoglycemia, ie, an event accompanied by clinical symptoms that are considered to result from low blood gl ucose regardless whether or not plasma 
glucose was determined. The event is treated with oral carbohydrate, glucagon or IV glucose.  
- Symptomatic overdose with IMP/NIMP (non-serious as well as serious) will be recorded on the standard AE form as “s ymptomatic overdose with IMP (or NIMP) 
accidental (or intentional)” and
 as hypoglycemia on the Hypoglycemia form. AE 
Safety Complementary form has to be completed, if serious. 
Of note, asymptomatic overdose (ie, an even t defined as above but which does not result 
in clinical symptoms regardless whether or not  plasma glucose was determined) has to be 
reported as a standard AE as “asymptomatic overdose with IMP (or NIMP) accidental (or 
intentional)”. For asymptomatic IMP/NIMP overdoses events with a measured plasma 
glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), corresponding hypoglycemia has to be 
reported on Hypoglycemia form, too. 
• ALT increase as outlined in flowchart in Appendix C.  
• Pregnancy 
- Pregnancy will be recorded as an AE in all cases. It will be qualified as an SAE only if 
it fulfills SAE criteria. 
- In the event of pregnancy, study treatme nt should be discontinued and the sponsor 
informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours).   
- Follow-up of the pregnancy will be mandatory until the outcome has been determined.

Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 73  10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the 
protocol for that patient, are to be recorded  on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of 
the e-CRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, 
and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or NIMPs or by the study procedure(s).   
• Whenever an event resulted from another, sepa rate event (eg, arm fracture secondary to 
fall), both should be re ported separately. 
• The investigator should take appropriate measures to follow a ll AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last plan ned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monito ring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by  the protocol for that patient. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI 
10.4.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the investigator or any designees must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send a notification to the monitoring team after approval of the investigator within the e-CRF or after a standard delay. 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perform ed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and email addr ess appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges.

During the course of the study, the S ponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at leas t reasonably related to the IMP (SUSAR), to 
the regulatory authorities, Institutional review boards/ Independent ethics committees 
(IRBs/IECs) as appropriate and to the investigators.    
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMP to the regulatory 
authorities, according to local regulations. 
In this study, some AEs considered related to the underlying condition (eg, blood glucose 
increased) will not be considered unexpected as given in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol 
will be considered unexpected. The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct  of the trial in the clinical 
study report (CSR). 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypoglycemia instructions 
Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia will be explained to patients/parents as well as situations 
posing the patient at high risk of hypoglycemia. Patients/parents will be instructed to measure finger stick plasma glucose levels with th e study-provided glucose meter prior to the 
administration of carbohydrates whenever symptomatic hypoglycemia is suspected, unless safety considerations necessita te immediate glucose rescue prior to  confirmation, and then a glucose 
measurement should be performed as soon as safe, with appropriate  diary documentation. 
Additional information related to the hypoglycemic event will be collected in the diary as soon after the event as possible. Following severe even ts, patients/parents will c ontact the sites as soon 
as possible to review the details and deci de on any necessary measures to be taken. 
Patients will report in the diary the occurrence of  symptoms suggesting hypoglycemia with or 
without SMPG values. Pa tients with SMPG value ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) will document in the 
diary whether it was symptomatic or asymptomat ic. If symptomatic, appropriate hypoglycemic 
symptoms will be reported. In all cases, patients/parents will document whether severity of symptoms warranted assistance in the patient’s care. 
All hypoglycemia episodes will be documented by the study site on the “hypoglycemia specific 
form” in the e-CRF. This includes all symptomatic hypoglycemia events and asymptomatic hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia events fulfilling the criteria of an SAE including all hypoglycemia events associated with coma, seizure or unconsciousness will be documented on the “hypoglycemia specific form” and as SAE on the “Adverse Event” form (category “Serious

For instructions concerning symptomatic hypoglycemia event resulting from an overdose with the 
IMP/NIMP, see Section  10.4.1.3 and Table 2 . 
Categories of hypoglycemia which will be assessed are described in Section  9.2.1. 
10.6.2 Hyperglycemia with ketosis instructions 
Testing of capillary ketones must be perform ed using the meter provided by the sponsor: 
• When SMPG is ≥252 mg/dL ( ≥14 mmol/L) in an unwell child (eg, feeling sick or 
nauseated; persistent polyuria, a bdominal pains, rapid breathing) 
• When SMPG persists at ≥252 mg/dL ( ≥14 mmol/L) without substantial decline over a 
period of approximately 60-120 mi nutes after injection of an extra dose of rapid-acting 
insulin analogue 
• During illness with fever and/or vomiting 
Ketone readings 1.5 mmol/L or more and concomitant SMPG ≥252 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) will be 
considered as alert for development of diabetic ketoacidosis and the investigator will be contacted immediately. The event will be reported as AE or – if respective criteria are met – as SAE 
(see Section  10.4.1.2). Self-measured ketones values will be documented in the diary. 
10.6.3 Local tolerability at injection site and hypersensitivity reactions 
If the investigator or the patient/parent recognizes any signs of local intolerability at the site of 
IMP or NIMP injection or hypersensitivity reacti ons, the event should be recorded in the adverse 
event page in the e-CRF. For local reactions at IMP/NIMP injection site, the event verbatim will 
include localization and, if known, the insulin (I MP or NIMP) associated with the reaction. 
If a patient reports severe injection site or hypersensitivity reaction between the on-site visits or 
during a phone call visit, the investigator should ask him/her to come to the study site on the same 
or the next day, so that the event can be prope rly assessed, reported and tr eated. Severe injection 
site reactions should be photographed if possible. 
10.6.4 Follow-up of laboratory abnormalities 
Decision trees for the management of specific laboratory abnormalities are provided in Appendix C .

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size calculation is based on the prima ry efficacy variable of HbA1c change from 
baseline to Month 6/Week 26. 
A sample size of 450 rando mized patients (225 for HOE901-U300 and 225 for Lantus) will 
ensure that the upper bound of the two-sided 95% c onfidence interval (CI) for the adjusted mean 
difference between HOE901-U300 and Lantus would not exceed a non-inferiority margin of 0.3% 
HbA1c with 92% power. This calculation assume s a common standard deviation (SD) of 0.95%, 
with a one-sided test at the 2.5% significant level and a true difference of zero in HbA1c between 
treatment groups. 
Calculations were made  using nQuery Advisor® Software Version 7.0. 
11.1.1 Justification of the non-inferiority margin 
Previous randomized studies in Type 1 diabetes  involving Lantus were considered for the 
justification of the choice of non-inferiority margin: in studies of similar duration, with HbA1C as 
the primary endpoint, and designed to show superi ority of Lantus versus NPH human insulin, the 
sample size calculation was based on a mean expected difference between treatment groups 
ranging between 0.5% and 0.7%. In study 4010 (a 30-week randomized study comparing Lantus 
and NPH in combination with insulin lispro), supe riority of Lantus over NPH was shown, with an 
estimated difference in HbA1C change between  Lantus and NPH of -0.53% (95%CI: -0.93, -
0.13).  To be in line with recommendations by regulatory agencies (11, 12) and considering that 
the non-inferiority margin must be less than the effect of Lantus versus NPH, and that the 
experimental treatment (HOE901-U300)  is requested to preserve a notable fraction of the effect 
considered as clinically relevant, a non-inferio rity margin of 0.3% was considered appropriate, 
corresponding to preservation of around 50% of  a difference ranging between 0.5% and 0.7%.

11.3.1 Efficacy populations 
11.3.1.1 Intent–to-treat population 
The primary efficacy population will be the ITT population, which includes all randomized 
patients, analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by randomization. 
11.3.2 Safety population 
The safety population is defined as all randomized  patients who did actually receive at least one 
dose of IMP, regardless of the amount of treatment administered. 
In the event of patients having received treatments that differed from those assigned according to 
the randomization schedule, then the safety analyses will be conducted accor ding to the treatment 
received rather than according to the randomization groups. 
Patients will not be considered exposed if there is documented evidence that patients have not 
taken the study drug: 
• If a patient is dispensed IMP and is lost to follow-up without any documented evidence 
whether or not the patient took  IMP, the patient will be considered  exposed and included 
in the safety population. 
• Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety  population as randomized. 
In addition:  
• Non randomized but treated patie nts will not be part of th e safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately.  
• For patients receiving more than one study treatment during the trial, the patient will be analyzed in the treatment group in which he/she was treated longer.  
11.3.3 PK population 
All patients who provided at least one PK meas urement and who do not have major deviation 
regarding administration of IMP w ill be included in the PK population.

11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by 
actual treatment received within the safety population. 
11.4.1.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
The duration of exposure during the study will be the total number of days of administration of IMP, ignoring temporar y drug discontinuation. 
The duration of exposure to the open-labe l IMP during the study is defined as: 
(Date of the last IMP administration – date of the first IMP administration) + 1 
Duration of IMP exposure will be summarized descriptively as a quantitative variable (number, 
mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).  In addition, durati on of treatment exposure will

A given administration will be c onsidered noncompliant if the pa tient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by the protocol.  No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data.  
Treatment compliance percentage will be summarized descriptively (N, Mean, SD, Median, Min, 
and Max). The percentage of patients with compliance <80% will be summarized. 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population. 
All efficacy parameters will be summarized by treatment group for each visit and at endpoint for 
the main 6-month randomized period and th e 12-month randomized period respectively. 
11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
11.4.2.1.1 Primary analysis 
The primary efficacy variable (change in HbA1c from baseline to Month 6 in % as defined in 
Section  9.1.1) will be analyzed for non-inferiority a ssessment, in the ITT population using all 
post-baseline HbA1c data available up to Month 6, regardless of study treatment discontinuation 
(analysis on the main 6-month randomized period (defined in Section  9.1), ITT estimand).  
A multiple imputation approach will be used where missing data from patients who do not adhere 
to IMP will be represented by the data from those patients in the same administration treatment 
group who also do not adhere to IMP but have th e measurement for the primary endpoint. Details 
of the proposed multiple imputation analys is in two parts, are provided below: 
1. Missing data in patients who prematurely discontinued IMP during the main 6-month treatment period will be imputed using a model estimated solely from data observed in other patients who prematurely discontinue IM P during the main 6-month treatment period 
and have change in HbA1c available at Week  26. Due to the anticipated small number of 
these latter patients, a basic imputation model will be built, including only the 
administration treatment group as predictor.  Missing data will be imputed using the 
regression method. 
2. Missing data in patients who complete the main 6-month on-treatment period will be 
imputed separately, using a model estimated from data observed in other patients who complete the main 6-month on-treatment peri od and have change in HbA1c available at 
Week 26. The imputation model will include  the administration treatment group, the 
randomization stratum of age group at  screening visit (<12 years and ≥12 years), the 
continuous fixed covariates of baseline HbA1c value, as well as the change from baseline in HbA1c observed at Week 12. Since in general, the missing pattern will not be monotone, a two-step approach will be used: 
- Step 1: the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (M CMC) method will be used in conjunction 
with the IMPUTE=MONOTONE option to create an imputed data set with a 
monotone missing pattern.

HOE901-EFC13957 -  insulin glargine Version number: 1 
 
Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 83  - Step 2: using the monotone data set from step 1, missing data will be imputed using 
the regression method. 
Missing values will be imputed 1,000 times. Comple ted datasets from the tw o parts detailed above 
will be combined into a single dataset. Each completed dataset will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of change from baseli ne to Week 26 in HbA1c, including the fixed 
categorical effects of administration treatme nt group, randomization strata, as well as the 
continuous fixed covariates of baseline value. The final results will be obtained by combining the 
least squares means and least squares mean di fferences from these 1,000 analyses, using Rubin’s 
formula.  
This model will provide baseline adjusted least squares (LS) means estimates at Month 6 for both 
treatment groups, as well as, the differences of th ese estimates, with their corresponding standard 
errors (SEs) and 95% CIs. 
A stepwise closed testing approach will be used  for the primary efficacy variable to assess non-
inferiority and superiority sequentially detailed in Section  11.4.2.3: 
• Step 1: to assess non-inferiority of HOE 901-U300 versus Lantus, the upper bound of the 
two-sided 95% CI (Confidence Interval) for th e difference in the mean change in HbA1c 
from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) be tween HOE901-U300 and Lantus on ITT 
population will be compared with the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. Non-
inferiority will be demonstrated  if this upper bound is <0.3%.  
• Step 2: only if the previous step of the hi erarchical procedure has been demonstrated, 
superiority of HOE901-U300 over Lantus in HbA1c change from baseline to endpoint (Month 6) will be assesse d. Superiority of HOE901-U300 over Lantus will be 
demonstrated if the upper bound of the two-side d 95% CI for the difference in the mean 
change in HbA1c from baseline to Month 6 between HOE901-U300 and Lantus is <0. 
The tests for the primary endpoint (Month 6)  will be performed one-sided at level α = 0.025. 
11.4.2.1.2 Key sensitivity analysis 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed on the change in HbA1c from baseline to Month 6 on 
patients who complete the main 6-month on-treatment period in th e ITT population, (ie, patients 
who perform Visit 14 [Week 26] and who do not permanently discontinue treatment). A similar 
multiple imputation approach as described for primary analysis part 2 will be used (ie, for missing data in patients who complete the main 6-month on-treatment period). 
11.4.2.1.3 Sensitivity analyses to handle missing data 
Sensitivity analyses will be conducte d to assess the robustness of primary efficacy analysis with 
regard to missing data. 
Penalized multiple imputation (MI)  
In order to assess the impact of missing data, th e change in HbA1c from baseline to Month 6 in % 
using HbA1c values during the randomized 6-month period (all post baseline available data), will 
be analyzed in the ITT population using a multiple imputation approach to account for missing

testing of treatment arms using an an alysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
Missing data will be imputed 1,000 times to generate 1,000 complete data sets with the MI SAS 
procedure. For each simulation leading to negativ e imputed value, another value will be redrawn 
for imputation using MINIMUM option of multiple imputation SAS procedure. Since in general, 
the missing pattern will not be monotone , a two-step approach will be used: 
• Step 1: the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used in conjunction with 
the IMPUTE=MONOTONE option to create an im puted data set with a monotone missing 
pattern 
• Step 2: using the monotone data set from step 1, missing data will be imputed using the 
regression method 
The imputation model for step 1 will include th e treatment group, baseline HbA1c value, as well 
as HbA1c values at Week 12 and Month 6.  
The imputation model for step 2 will include the same variables as in step 1 with the 
randomization strata. 
For each simulation leading to negative imputed  value, another value will be redrawn for 
imputation using MINIMUM option of MI SAS procedure. The imputed HbA1c value at Week 26 in the HOE901-U300 group will then be penalized by 
adding 0.3% (corresponding to the non-inferiorit y margin) to the imputed HbA1c value whereas 
the imputed HbA1c in the Lantus group will not be penalized. The change in HbA1c from 
baseline to endpoint will then be derived from observed and imputed (penalized or not) HbA1c 
value at Week 26. 
The 1,000 complete data sets will then be analyzed  using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model including the fixed categor ical effects of randomization stratum of age group at screening 
visit (<12 years and ≥12 years), treatment group, as well as, the continuous fixed covariate of 
baseline HbA1c value. The MIANALYZE procedure will then be used to generate valid statistical 
inferences by combining results from th e 1,000 analyses using Rubin’s formulae.  
This procedure will provide baseline adjusted l east-squares means estimates at Week 26 for both 
treatment groups, as well as, the differences of these estimates, with their corresponding SEs and 
95% CIs. 
Tipping point analysis 
 
In order to assess the impact of missing data, a tip ping-point analysis based on the pattern mixture 
model approach will also be performed. A specific illustration on the value of the minimum 
penality leading to a non-rejection of the null hypothesis will be provided ( 13). 
The tipping point analysis will be conducted by multiply imputing missing HbA1c values with a 
delta adjustment in the HOE901-U300 arm. In the tipping point analysis, missing HbA1c values at 
Week 26 will be imputed and a delta (HbA1c increase) will be added to each imputed value in the HOE901-U300 arm in the ITT population.

11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints are described in Section  9.1.2. 
All secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed and summarized on the main 6-month 
randomized period using the ITT population (ITT estimand). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the ITT population, using all available data on 
the 6-month randomized period (ITT estimand).  A similar multiple imputation approach  in two parts, as described above for the primary efficacy 
endpoint, adding randomization stra tum of screening HbA1c (<8.5%; ≥8.5%) only in part 2 
imputation model (ie, for missing  data in patients who complete the main 6-month on-treatment 
period), will be used for change from baseline in FPG at Week 26. This analysis will be used 
descriptively. 
The other continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed descriptively only. 
Categorical efficacy parameters will be analyzed by using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) 
method with treatment as fact ors, stratified by randomiza tion stratum of HbA1c (<8.5%, ≥8.5%) 
and by randomization stratum of age group (<12 years and ≥12 years) at screening. 95 % 
confidence interval for the treatment difference or ratios will be provided for descriptive purpose only. 
All secondary endpoints will be eval uated at end of trea tment of the whole study (Week 52), for 
descriptive purpose, using the same st atistical methods as  described above. 
11.4.2.3 Multiplicity considerations 
To control the type I error, a hierarchical step-down testing procedure will be applied. 
• Step 1: non-inferiority comparison of the mean change from baseline to Month 6/ Week 26  
in HbA1c with HOE901-U300 compared to Lantus 
• Step 2: only if non-inferiority is demonstr ated, superiority of HOE901-U300 over Lantus 
of the mean change from baseline to Month 6/ Week 26  in HbA1c will be assessed 
The other secondary efficacy variables will be  analyzed for exploratory purpose only.

Assembly (Helsinki, 1964) and a ll applicable amendments laid down by the World Medical 
Assemblies, and the Interna tional Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for good 
clinical practice (GCP), all applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
This clinical trial will be recorded in a free, pub licly accessible, internet-based registry, no later 
than 21 days after the first patient enrollment, in compliance with applicable regulatory 
requirements and with Sanofi public disclosure commitments.  
12.2 INFORMED CONSENT 
The investigator (according to applicable regulato ry requirements), or a person designated by the 
investigator, should fully inform the patient (and the parent[s]) of all pertinent aspects of the 
clinical trial including the written information given approval/favorable opinion by the ethics committee (IRB) /(IEC). All participants should be informed to  the fullest extent possible about 
the study in language and terms they are able to understand. 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the clinical trial, the in formed consent form should be signed, 
name filled in and personally dated by the patient’s parent(s) or by the patient’s legally acceptable 
representative, and by the pe rson who conducted the informed consent discussion.  Local law 
must be observed in deciding whether 1 or both pare nts consent is required.  If only 1 parent signs 
the consent form, where both signatures are requi red, the investigator must document the reason 
for only 1 parent signature. 
In addition, participants will assent as detailed below or will follow the Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC) approved standard practice for pediatric participants at each participating center. Patients who can read the assent form will do so before writing their name and dating and signing 
the form. 
Patients who cannot read will have  the assent form read to them in presence of an impartial 
witness, who will sign and date the assent form to confirm that assent was given. Such patients, if 
only are able to write, will also be offered to sign and date the form. 
The informed consent form and the assent form used  by the investigator for obtaining the Parent´s 
informed consent and Patient´s a ssent must be reviewed and appr oved by the Sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) for approval/favorable opinion.

 to the consent for optiona l PK blood sampling, including assent process 
with the patient. 
Prior to collection of blood for PK evaluations, th e optional PK informed consent form (written) 
must be signed, name filled in, and personally dated by the parent(s), and by the person who 
conducted the informed consent discussion. A copy of the signed and dated written optional 
informed consent form will be provided to the parent. The optional PK assent form must be obtained from the patient prior to collection of blood for PK eval uations, according to the rules 
applicable to the main study assent. 
The main study informed consent form and the optional PK informed consent forms as well as 
corresponding assents used by the investigator for obtaining the parent’s informed consent as well 
as the patient's assent must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor prior to submission to the 
appropriate Ethics Committee (IRB/I EC) for approval/favorable opinion. 
12.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE (IRB/IEC) 
As required by local regulation, the investigator or  the Sponsor must submit  this clinical trial 
protocol to the appropriate IRB/ IEC, and is required to forward to the respective other party  a 
copy of the written and dated approval/favorable opinion signed by the Chairman with  IRB/IEC 
composition. 
In relation with the population of patients exposed in the trial ie , pediatric/minor patients, the 
IRB/IEC should ensure proper advice from specialist  with pediatrics expertise (competent in the 
area of clinical, ethical and psychosocial problems in the field of pediatri cs) according to national 
regulations. This should be documented. The clinical trial (study number, clinical trial protocol title and version number), the documents 
reviewed (clinical trial protocol, informed c onsent form, assent, Investigator’s Brochure, 
investigator’s curriculum vitae [CV], etc) and the date of the review should be clearly stated on 
the written (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinion. 
IMP will not be released at the study site and the investigator will not start the study before the 
written and dated approva l/favorable opinion is received by the investigator and the Sponsor. 
During the clinical trial, any amendment or modification to the clinical trial protocol should be 
submitted to the IRB/IEC before implementation, unless the change is necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the patients, in which cas e the IRB/IEC should be informed as soon as 
possible. It should also be inform ed of any event likely to affect the safety of patients or the 
continued conduct of the clinical trial, in particular any change  in safety. All updates to the 
Investigator’s Brochure will be sent to the IRB/IEC. 
A progress report is sent to the IRB/IEC at least annually and a summary of the clinical trial’s 
outcome at the end of the clinical trial.

The investigator is required to ensure compliance with all procedures required by the clinical trial 
protocol and with all study pro cedures provided by the Sponsor (i ncluding security rules). The 
investigator agrees to provide reliable data and all information requested by the clinical trial protocol (with the help of the e-CRF, Discrepancy Resolution Form (DRF)] or other appropriate 
instrument) in an accurate and legible manner acco rding to the instructions provided and to ensure 
direct access to source documents by Sponsor representatives. 
If any circuit includes transfer of  data particular attention should be paid to the confidentiality of 
the patient's data to be transferred. The investigator may appoint such other individuals as he/she may de em appropriate as sub-
investigators to assist in the conduct of the clinical trial in acc ordance with the clinical trial 
protocol. All sub-investigators shall be appointed and liste d in a timely manner. The sub-
investigators will be supervised by and work under the responsibility of the investigator. The 
investigator will provide them with a copy of the clinical trial protocol and all necessary 
information. 
13.2 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SPONSOR 
The Sponsor of this clinical tria l is responsible to regulatory authorities for taking all reasonable 
steps to ensure the proper conduct of the clinical trial as regards ethics, clinical trial protocol 
compliance, and integrity and validity of the data  recorded on the e-CRFs. Thus, the main duty of 
the monitoring team is to help the investigator and the Sponsor maintain a high level of ethical, 
scientific, technical and regulatory quality in all aspects of the clinical trial. 
At regular intervals during the clinical trial, the site will be contacted, through monitoring visits, 
letters or telephone calls, by a re presentative of the monitoring team to review study progress, 
investigator and patient compliance with clinical trial protocol requirements and any emergent problems. These monitoring visits will include but not be limited to review of the following aspects: patient assent/parent informed cons ent form, patient recruitment and follow-up, SAE 
documentation and reporting, AESI documenta tion and reporting, AE documentation, IMP 
allocation, patient compliance with the IMP re gimen, IMP accountability, concomitant therapy

According to the ICH GCP, the monitoring team must check the e-CRF entries against the source 
documents, except for the pre-identified source data directly recorded in the e-CRF. The informed consent form will include a statement by which th e parent allows the S ponsor’s duly authorized 
personnel, the Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), and the re gulatory authorities to have direct access to 
original medical records of the patient which supp ort the data on the e-CRFs (eg, patient's medical 
file, patient’s diary entries, a ppointment books, original laboratory  records, etc). These personnel, 
bound by professional secrecy, must maintain the confidentialit y of all personal identity or 
personal medical information (according to confidentiality and personal data protection rules). 
13.4 USE AND COMPLETION OF CASE REPORT FORMS (CRFS) AND ADDITIONAL 
REQUEST 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ma intain adequate and accurate e-CRFs (according to 
the technology used) designed by the Sponsor to record (according to Sponsor instructions) all 
observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation in a timely manner. In case of a need to use back-up plan for SAE and other in vestigator Expedited Events reporting process 
eg, due to e-CRF system failure, all CRFs should be  completed in their entirety in a neat, legible 
manner to ensure accurate  interpretation of data. 
Should a correction be made, the corrected information will be entered in the e-CRF overwriting 
the initial information. An audit trail allows identifying the modification.  
Data are available within the system to the S ponsor as soon as they are entered in the e-CRF. 
The computerized handling of the data by the Sp onsor may generate add itional requests (DRF) to 
which the investigator is obliged to respond by confirming or modifying the data questioned. The 
requests with their responses will be managed through the (e-CRF). 
13.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
The complete list of computerized systems used for the study is provided in a separate document 
which is maintained in the Sponsor and investigator study files.

TITLE  Early therapeutic monitoring of response to 
therapy with serial ultrasound in metastatic 
RCC  
STUDY PHASE  Pilot  
INDICATION  Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC)  
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 
OR PROCEDURE  Study of power Doppler ultrasound for early 
detection of therapeutic response after 
initiating therapy with: 
arm 1: tyrosine kinase (TKI) inhibitor plus 
immune checkpoint inhibitor  (ICI) 
arm 2: non -ICI therapy  (e.g., TKI monotherapy, 
combination of TKI with other kinase inhibitor, localized tumor therapy such as radiation, 
chemo - or radioembolization ) 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S)  To assess whether changes in quantitative 
tumor perfusion parameters after 3 weeks  of 
treatment , as measured by LEAD ultrasound, 
can predict initial objective response, defined 
by current standard- of-care, to therapy at 12 
weeks after start of treatment   
SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S)  To evaluate if there is an optimal ultrasound 
imaging modality (power Doppler or LEAD 
ultrasound) or optimal time point to predict initial objective response , to assess the correlation of 
tumor perfusion parameters 
with change in 
overall tumor burden, change in diameter on a 
per-lesion basis and with 12- month 
progression -free survival (PFS).  
STUDY PROCEDURE 
SUMMARY  power Doppler and LEAD ultrasound of 
subjects taking targeted therapy medication , 
measured  at treatment ‘ baseline’ , 3-4 weeks , 
and 6-8 weeks after initiating treatment   
SAMPLE SIZE  arm 1: 20 subjects  
arm 2: up to 10 subjects  
STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  We will evaluate the predictive ability of each 
model using area under the curve (AUC). For this pilot study, assuming that 59% of patients in arm 1 have an objective response to 
treatment, a predictive model with a true AUC of 0.7 will have a margin of error of 0.14 so that the estimated AUC can range from 0.56 to 
0.84.

Version 9 .0 Page 10  of 31  1 May  2023  1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objective   
Our primary objective is to assess whether in arm 1, changes in quantitative tumor 
perfusion parameters 3 weeks  after start  of treatment of metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC) patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI) plus immune 
checkpoint inhibitor  (ICI), as measured by LEAD  ultrasound, can predict  initial 
objective response to therapy at 12 weeks after start of treatment defined by 
current standard- of-care Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST  
v1.1)1. 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
Our secondary objectives are to evaluate in arm 1, if there is an optimal ultrasound 
imaging modality (power Doppler or LEAD ultrasound),  or optimal time point to 
predict initial objective response. We will assess how well 1) changes in tumor 
perfusion parameters 6 weeks after start of treatment by imaging modality or 2) 
tumor perfusion parameters at a single time point (treatment ‘baseline’ , 3 weeks , 
or 6 weeks after start of  treatment) , predict  initial objective response ( at 12 weeks ) 
per RECIST  v1.1. 
 Additional exploratory objectives in both arms are to assess the correlation of 
tumor perfusion parameters with change in overall tumor burden (defined as sum 
of the longest diameters of all measurable lesions  defined by RECIST  v1.1) 12 
weeks after start of treatment, with change in diameter on a per -lesion basis 
(correlation between perfusion parameters of a single lesion with change in diameter of that lesion), and with 12-month progression- free survival (PFS) . 
 
 2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease  
Renal cancer is the 8
th most common cancer in the U.S. and patients with 
metastatic RCC (mRCC) have a 5 -year overall survival (OS) rate of 12%2. There 
are 17 FDA-approved drugs for mRCC , which  include TKIs of vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 , a key mediator of angiogenesis), and 
antibodies that target immune checkpoint  proteins such as programmed cell death  
protein-1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand -1 (PD-L1), or cytotoxic T -lymphocyte-
associated protein 4 (CTLA -4)3–10. 
 
In April 2019, the FDA approved the combinations of a TKI  (axitinib)  with an ICI  
(pembrolizumab or avelumab)  for first -line treatment of mRCC and additional TKI 
plus ICI combination therapies  (cabozantinib plus nivolumab, lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab) have been approved more recently11,12. TKI plus ICI has become 
the new standard- of-care first -line treatment that improves OS  for patients with 
mRCC11. 
 
Early Therapeutic Monitoring of Response to Therapy with Serial Ultrasound in Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma  
Version 9 .0 Page 11  of 31  1 May  2023  2.2 Imaging Procedure  
Power Doppler ultrasound is an ideal non-invasive modality for serial 
measurements because it can be performed at bedside during routine oncology 
visits. However, due to the relatively large depths at which some organs such as 
the kidneys are located  and the low frequencies utilized to image deep structures, 
the ability to detect the smaller vasculature of tumors and the potential changes in tumor vasculature becomes increasingly difficult. Hence, in addition to the commercially available power Doppler imaging mode, we will incorporate advanced power Doppler imaging techniques that improve the sensitivity to slower flow and smaller vessels in our study. Specifically, this advanced power Doppler mode utilizes long Doppler ensembles combined with short -lag angular 
coherence beamforming to achieve high sensitivity to slow flow and small vessels  
(Long Ensemble Angular -coherence Doppler [LEAD] ultrasound). The long 
Doppler ensemble increases the sensitivity to flow by utilizing high frame rates (~300 Hz) to boost the si gnal-to-noise ratio of the blood signal
13. Moreover , 
angular coherence beamforming is utilized in LEAD ultrasound studies  to 
suppress motion/flash artifact over the long ensemble while also suppressing incoherent noise due to reverberation and thermal nois e
14,15. 
 
For the ultrasound exams at treatment ‘baseline’ and 3 and 6 weeks after initiating treatment  in this pilot study , lesions are imaged with B -mode and power Doppler 
ultrasound  using a portable Siemens Acuson S3000 ultrasound scanner  and a 
6C1 or similar transducer (FDA -approved for clinical ultrasound exams but  used 
only for research exams for this study). Measurements are performed in the long axis and short axis planes , if possible by tumor localization . For LEAD ultrasound 
exams,  the same views are obtained using a Verasonics Vantage 256 scanner 
with a C5 -2v or similar transducer  (research ultrasound scanner) . 
 
2.3 Clinicaltrials.gov  
The Verasonics system operates under an  abbreviated Investigational Device 
Exemption (IDE)  approved by the Stanford IRB . The device has non- significant 
risk. The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov under registration number  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. 
 
2.4 Rationale  
Unfortunately, not all mRCC patients respond to first -line treatment, yet all 
patients endure the side effects of treatment (fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and/or liver inflammation) while awaiting standard- of-care imaging (typically computed 
tomography, CT)  to assess response after approximately 12 weeks of therapy
16–
22. Evaluation of efficacy currently requires  this time period because molecular 
and cellular changes induced by therapy require about 12 weeks to result in 
definitive changes in tumor diameters on CT scans. Patients may respond to subsequent lines of therapy; yet approximately 40% of patients never receive second- line therapy despite 13 additional drugs available
23–25. Thus, rapid 
detection of response or resistance to RCC therapy is required to minimize use 
Early Therapeutic Monitoring of Response to Therapy with Serial Ultrasound in Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma  
Version 9 .0 Page 12  of 31  1 May  2023  of ineffective drugs and to allow patients to cycle through drugs to arrive at 
effective therapy22. 
 Increased angiogenesis and immune system evasion are intrinsic to RCC. Clear cell RCC occurs when the von- Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor is lost, resulting 
in upregulation of angiogenesis and suppression of immune signaling. In RCC, blood vessels increase in number but have abnormal porosit y
26–29. The abnormal 
porosity prevents T cells from exiting blood vessels to infiltrate and attack tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibition normalizes blood vessel porosity, allowing T cell egress
27,30,31. Hence changes in tumor vascularity may be especially important in 
RCC patients receiving TKI therapy  (alone or in combination with other drugs) . 
 We have previously found that imaging- based biomarkers (e.g. , perfusion CT, 
‘4D-CT’ scans, or novel positron emission tomography [ PET] tracers such as  F18-
FPPRGD2 that binds blood vessels) may have the capability of detecting early response to anti -angiogenic therapy in mRCC
32,33. However, due to renal 
dysfunction and often only a solitary remaining kidney after resection of the initial kidney primary lesion, patients are not always eligible for perfusion CT, which requires potentially nephrotoxic iodinated contrast. A limitation of PET imaging is that nuclear imaging does not provide measurements of blood flow. Hence, there is an important clinical need for complimentary, non- nephrotoxic imaging that can 
be serially repeated without exposure to ionizing radiation, to predict respo nse 
and resistance to TKI plus ICI and other mRCC therapies.  
 In addition, not all patients can tolerate TKI plus ICI combination therapy, so we have added an exploratory arm 2 to investigate the ability of Doppler ultrasound 
to detect changes in tumor perfusion in patients who are planned to receive non-
ICI therapies. These include, but are not limited to: TKI monotherapy, combination of TKI with another kinase inhibitor (e.g., mTOR inhibitor), localized tumor therapy such as radiation, radioembolization, chemoembolization. (Patients receiving 
ICI/ICI combination the rapy or ICI monotherapy are enrolled in the parallel 
ultrasound study ‘Serial Ultrasound to Detect Early Response to Immunotherapy in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma’ (RENAL0045). The choice of treatment is made by the treating medical oncologist based on clinical  considerations  per 
standard- of-care (e.g., comorbidities and performance status, need for immediate 
control over tumor growth versus long- lasting tumor control, response to previous 
treatments, tolerance of previous treatments). Patients are assigned to a study arm based on the treatment plan at the time of enrollment.  
 Contrast -enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been used for the identification of 
renal focal lesions and has shown some promise in preliminary studies to monitor 
changes with therapy
34,35. However, CEUS has not widely been explored as a 
methodology to monitor anti -angiogenesis or combination therapy. Furthermore, 
the use of CEUS to monitor therapeutic response may be unnecessary, as recent advances in power Doppler imaging have yielded non- contrast, high- sensitivity 
perfusion imaging  by using novel filter and ultrasound beamforming design
13,36–
Early Therapeutic Monitoring of Response to Therapy with Serial Ultrasound in Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma  
Version 9 .0 Page 13  of 31  1 May  2023  41. Such methods have also been applied to monitor cancer therapy response in 
the liver39,42. Doppler ultrasound is an ideal modality for serial measurements 
because it can be performed at bedside during routine oncology visits, without 
requiring placement of an intravenous catheter for administration of contrast.  In 
this pilot study, we use conventional power Doppler and LEAD ultrasound imaging 
to non-invasively assess changes in tumor perfusion parameters performed in 
real time,  with the ultimate goal to accelerate detection of response to combined 
TKI plus ICI therapy.  
  
2.5 Preliminary results  
We have previously demonstrated good performance of LEAD  ultrasound  in 
neonates to show highly detailed brain vasculature and suppression of flash- and 
motion -artifac t15. In addition, we used this technique for  deep imaging within the 
liver (~22 cm), which overcomes difficulties of imaging large or obese individuals 
with high body mass index  (unpublished results, see Figure).  
 
Figure: Demonstration of LEAD applied to the liver of a high BMI 
individual. This power Doppler -style image shows sensitivity to a wide 
range of vasculature deep within the liver. The smallest vessels visualized 
are on the order of 1 mm in diameter.  
   
 
     
 
    
 
2.6 Study Design  
This is a pilot, single group imaging study, testing a new method of therapeutic 
response assessment, power Doppler ultrasound, in mRCC patients treated with TKI 
plus ICI  (arm 1) or non -ICI therapy ( arm 2). A total of 30 subjects will be  enrolled for a 
two-arm, open- label cohort. No randomization is  used. Rather, subjects receiving the 
treatment as part of their standard of care are  followed with the ultrasound studies.  
Since this is an exploratory pilot study and we are not formally testing a specific research hypothes is, the sample size  for each arm has been chosen based on 
practical considerations and estimated feasibility .

as the study does not include any  formal interpretation of the ultrasound exams)  
• the c linical ultrasound machine is set up with a research function to keep clinical 
care and research separate (not applicable to this study, as all scanners are exclusively used 
for research) . 
Performing the exam includes holding the transducer, providing patient care related 
to the exam in collaboration with the investigators, and documenting the encounter in the patient’s Stanford Healthcare medical record. Investigators with expertise in 
ultrasound are allowed to be present and provide assistance with operating the 
instrument to the licensed professional . Assistance may include image review, 
instrument operation during the scan, but not  providing any patient -related care or 
holding the transducer.  
 
The selected lesions (see section 10.3.2)  are imaged in B- mode and with power 
Doppler ultrasound  using a portable Siemens Acuson S3000 ultrasound scanner and 
a 6C1 or similar transducer, in the long axis and short axis planes , if possible by 
localization. For LEAD ultrasound exams, the  same views using a Verasonics Vantage 
256 scanner with a C5 -2v or similar transducer  are obtained . The ultrasound exams 
take place during standard- of-care or research- only clinic visits  at Stanford 
Healthcare .

 5. STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
5.1 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Subjects are removed from active study  participation (i.e. , no further ultrasound 
exams) , if 
• they are non- compliant with study procedures ; 
• their treatment plan changes before the first ultrasound exam such that the new treatment plan does not qualify for this study;  
• they start a different treatment during the active study participation period; 
• for participants in arm 1, they receive less than 4 weeks  of TKI treatment  
during the first 12 weeks after initiating TKI plus ICI therapy  (i.e. minimum 4 of 
12 weeks of TKI treatment and minimum one dose of ICI required for continued study participation) ; 
• for participants in arm 2, they receive less than 4 weeks of systemic therapy 
druing the first 12 weeks after initiating treatment . (For localized therapies, the 
minimum treatment requirements are determined by the Protocol Director.)  
 Subjects removed from active study participation with valid written consent are 
followed up per study protocol, so that data acquired by study procedures up to 
that time point can still be used for analysis . 
 
5.2 Alternatives  
As an alternative to this study, the patient may elect not to participate. Patients 
will continue to receive standard care through their oncologist.

a) Doppler ultrasound exams : power Doppler and LEAD ultrasound exams, performed during standard- of-care clinic visit or 
at research- only visit ; if exam can be performed only with one of the two ultrasound scanners, only in one axis, or if  one 
time point is missed  entirely , subsequent exams may still be performed in full within their allowed time window.  
b) Standard- of-care imaging: The baseline standard-of -care scan is generally within 6 weeks prior to initiating therapy, but 
may be greater than 6 weeks prior to therapy, if this is the scan that the treating physician chooses to use as reference  
for response evaluation. Preferably, this is a CT Chest -Abdomen- Pelvis (CAP) scan (with or without contrast), but it may 
also be an MRI or PET/CT  or a combination of MRI and CT .  At the discretion of the treating oncologist, the standard- of-
care scan at week 12 may be performed outside of the +/ - 4-week window.  
c) Adverse event (AE) evaluation: Only AEs that are attributed to the study procedures are recorded and reported. During 
study procedures, study coordinator reminds patient to contact the clinical care team, if they experience any symptoms 
during the exam or afterwards. If the participant expr esses to the coordinator that they have experienced symptoms 
during or after the exam, the coordinator will alert  the clinical care team on the same day to contact the patient for AE 
evaluation and management. During baseline through week 12, patient will continue with standard-of -care provider visits 
at or outside of Stanford (generally, every 2- 6 weeks, at the discretion of the treating clinical care team) including adverse 
event management. At week 12, a retrospective chart review will document any undisclosed study -related late adverse 
events and assure there are no ongoing study -related adverse events. If there is no adequate information in the medical 
record at week 12, patient will be contacted if needed to complete this documentation. Therefore, at minimum, there is 
one documented AE evaluation at week 12.  
d) to be recorded once between baseline and study completion  
e) may be obtained until study completion, even after a participant’s death; patients or their outside medical providers may 
be contacted as needed to obtain the clinico- demographic data, if not available in the Stanford medical record.  
f) to be quantified and recorded for all ultrasound exams from this study  
g) RECIST measurements t o be recorded for all imaging studies used  for response evaluation ( CT, MRI or PET/CT as 
described in footnote (b).  Performed at minimum at baseline and 12 weeks. RECIST measurements will also be recorded for other subsequent standard- of-care studies that the treating MD obtains at any interval to evaluate treatment response 
(until 12 months after initiating treatment  or until end of the treatment  that is being studied, whichever occurs first ) 
h) For combination treatments, initiation of therapy is typically defined by the day of starting treatment with the second drug, 
however another day (such as the start of treatment with the first drug) may be defined as start of treatment at the 
discretion of the Protocol Director; date considered start of treatment will be documented in the research procedure note 
in the electronic medical record. 
i) 10 days is the minimum time period between week -3 and week -6 power Doppler ultrasound exams ; similarly, 10 days is 
the minimum time period between week -3 and week -6 LEAD ultrasound exams; it is not required that power Doppler and 
LEAD ultrasound exams are performed on the same date.

7.1 Potential Adverse Events 
There are no known risks from ultrasound as a diagnostic tool in its 60 years of 
use. The Verasonics system used for LEAD ultrasound exams operates the same way as a regular ultrasound system, except the investigators are performing  the 
acoustic output measurements instead of the manufacturer. The system has also been cleared by Clinical Engineering. Therefore, the risks are no different than a clinical ultrasound scanner  such as the FDA -approved Siemens system used for 
the conventional power Doppler ultrasound exams. We have also previously used the Verasonics  system in several IRB -approved protocols in studies involving 
imaging of adult liver, adult heart, adult thyroid, and neonatal brain. There have been no adverse events in any of these studies or subjects/patients.  
 Possible  adverse events from the procedure include discomfort or tenderness in 
some cases from slightly pressing the transducer against the tumor site. H owever , 
protocol directors are  available in the event of an unforeseen adverse event or 
the need for medical intervention.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
For this study, only Adverse Events ( AEs) attributed to ultrasound use are  
reported.  
During study procedures,  the study coordinator reminds patient to contact the 
clinical care team, if they experience any symptoms during the exam or afterwards. If the participant expresses to the coordinator that they have experienced symptoms during or after the exam, the coordinat or will alert the 
clinical care team on the same day to contact the patient for AE evaluation and management. During baseline through week 12, patient will continue with standard- of-care provider visits at or outside of Stanford  (generally, every 2- 6 
weeks, at the discretion of the treating clinical care team) including adverse event management. At week 12, a retrospective chart review will document any undisclosed study -related late adverse events and assure there are no ongoing  
study -related adverse events. If there is no adequate information in the medical 
record at week 12, patient will be contacted if needed to complete this documentation. Therefore, at minimum, there is one documented AE evaluation at week 12.  
 AEs are graded according to CTCAE v 5.0. Both Serious and Non- Serious study -
related AEs are clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific 
Case Report Forms  in RedCAP . The Protocol Director or designee assess each 
AE to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent  or 
Protocol Document and related to the investigation. All study -related Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) are  tracked until resolution.  AEs and SAEs  related  to 
standard- of-care procedures or medication, including the studied drug therapy  for 
RCC, are not recorded or reported.

Version 9 .0 Page 19  of 31  1 May  2023  8. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant 
information related to the study ( e.g., advertisements used to recruit participants) 
must be  reviewed and approved by the Stanford IRB  and Scientific Review 
Committee (SRC) . Any changes made to the protocol will be submitted as a 
modification to be approved by the IRB and SRC prior to implementation. The 
Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all participating investigators.  
 
8.2 Data Management Plan  
An alphanumeric study code is selected by the study coordinator for each participant.  Source documents and analytic data are used to complete the 
electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) in the Stanford RedCAP database.  An  
eCRFs  needs to be completed for each enrolled patient and , at minimum, needs 
to contain the following data:  
- study code  
- age, race, ethnicity, sex, diagnosis, cancer stage, tumor histology, and drug treatment  
- identification of lesions selected for ultrasound exams and for response evaluation  
- identification of time points and modality of ultrasound exams and standard-of-care radiographic imaging  
- tumor perfusion parameters quantified from ultrasound studies  
- tumor diameter measurements quantified from standard- of-care radiographic 
imaging studies  
- primary and secondary outcomes measures.  
 
The digital ultrasound images including PHI may be stored on the ultrasound scanners for the duration for the study. Ultrasound image files that are transferred off the scanners have coded file names and the files are stored on Dr. Dahl’s lab 
servers  or using cloud storage services that are certified for PHI (e.g. , Stanford 
Medicine Box) . Other source documents need to be included in the regulatory 
binder . The Stanford's Data & Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will routinely 
review the source documentation (incl. the raw imaging files on Dr. Dahl’s lab servers) and verify the corresponding data entered in the eCRFs. All entered, changed, and final data shall be available with a validated audit trail or data extract report. The eCRFs shall be considered complete when all expected data has been entered and all discrepancies have been resolved or documented.  
 Source documents, other documents containing HIPAA identifiers, clinico -
demographic or  analytic data linked to the participants’ identity ( i.e., Protected 
Health Information, PHI), and information linking study codes to participant identities may be additionally maintained in paper form or electronically on co-
investigators’ computers or using cloud storage services that are certified for PHI 
Early Therapeutic Monitoring of Response to Therapy with Serial Ultrasound in Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma  
Version 9 .0 Page 20  of 31  1 May  2023  (e.g., OnCore, Stanford Medicine Box)  until study completion. All computers need 
to comply with Stanford University IT security standards. Access to files and 
folders  with PHI (paper or electronic) must be restricted to the study personnel .  
 
Upon study closure, a ll PHI  not stored in the regulatory binder  (physical and 
electronic), regulatory database (i.e., OnCore),  or eCRFs  must be destroyed , for 
example by de- identifying the data and files in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy 
Rule. Ultrasound data must be removed from the ultrasound scanners upon study 
closure . However,  ultrasound images with PHI may be retained in the electronic 
medical record at Stanford Healthcare at the discretion of the study radiologists  
as long as they are clearly designated as research data and not associated with a formal interpretation . 
 The Protocol Directors have ultimate responsibility for collection and reporting of all clinical safety  and study data entered in the eCRFs and any other data 
collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are attributable, legible, contemporaneous (timely), original, and accurate as well as complete, consistent, and available when required.  
 
8.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
During the clinical investigation, the Protocol Director s will evaluate the progress 
of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness , 
adherence to the data management plan, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of trial sites, and other factors that can affect study outcome.    The Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) will 
audit study -related activities at least annually in accordance with the DSMC SOP 
to determine whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of  regulatory binders, case report forms, 
eligibility checklists, and source documents. In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human subjects. Results of DSMC audit s will 
be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.

9.1 Primary Outcome M easures 
The primary endpoint  is initial objective respons e per RECIST v1.1 assessed 8-
16 weeks after start of treatment, using standard- of-care imaging.  expressed as 
a number and proportion without dispersion . 
 
Early Therapeutic Monitoring of Response to Therapy with Serial Ultrasound in Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma  
Version 9 .0 Page 21  of 31  1 May  2023  Initial objective response (yes/no) : defined as having either Complete Response 
(CR) or Partial Response (PR) per RECIST v1.1  at first on -treatment response 
evaluation 8- 16 weeks  after initiating treatment . 
 
9.1.1  Measurement Methods Tumor diameter measurements : Where possible, the same lesions that 
were selected for repeat LEAD ultrasound exams are  used as target 
lesions for response evaluation per RECIST . Different lesions may be 
selected at the discretion of the radiologist designated to review response evaluation.  
 
9.1.2  Measurement Time Points At treatment ‘baseline’ (prior to starting treatment) and 12 weeks after start 
of treatment (+/- 4 weeks) standard- of-care radiographic imaging is  
performed for initial response evaluation.  
No further follow -up is required for the primary endpoint.  
 
9.1.3  Response Review  
Response evaluation per RECIST  v1.1 is reviewed by a designated 
radiologist , who may be the same person that performs the tumor diameter 
measurements . 
  
9.2 Secondary Outcome  Measures  
 Secondary endpoints are: 
1) initial relative change  in tumor burden (continuous ): defined as relative 
change (i.e., difference between time points divided by value at time point 
1, expressed as percentage)  in the sum of all tumor diameters  between 
treatment ‘baseline’ and first on- treatment response evaluation 8- 16 weeks 
after start of treatment, using RECIST v1.1 for tumor diameter 
measurements , expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation and median with 
interquartile range  
2) initial lesion response (continuous) : defined as the relative change in 
tumor diameter of a single lesion between treatment ‘ baseline’ and first on -
treatment response evaluation 8-16 weeks after start of treatment , using 
RECIST v1.1 for tumor diameter measurements , expressed as mean +/ - 
standard deviation and median with interquartile range . 
3) 12-month progression- free survival (PFS)  (yes/no) : defined as not 
having experienced any PD per RECIST v1.1 within the first 12 months after 
initiating treatment  (day 1 will be treatment start date) , as a number and

9.2.2  Measurement Time Points Initial response evaluation is  performed by radiographic imaging at the 
same timepoints as for the primary endpoint.  For repeat response 
evaluations on treatment, standard- of-care restaging imaging studies will 
be used. These, as well as determination of 12 -month PFS, require follow -
up at 12 months after initiation of treatment .  
 
9.2.3  Response Review  
Response evaluation per RECIST v1.1 is  reviewed by a designated 
radiologist , who may be the same person that performs the tumor diameter 
measurements . 
 
  10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Statistical Design  
This is a pilot study to evaluate how well changes in tumor perfusion 
parameters, assessed by LEAD ultrasound 3 weeks after initiating treatment with TKI plus ICI, predict initial objective response, as determined by standard-
of-care radiographic imaging 8- 16 weeks after start of treatment. All secondary 
endpoints are exploratory  and are intended for generating hypotheses  that will 
requir e follow- up studies.  
 
10.2 Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis  
We will characterize the study population by providing demographic and clinical 
characteristics. Categorical data will be presented as frequencies and 
percentages. For continuous data, mean, standard deviation, median, 25
th and 
75th percentiles will be presented. In addition, we will use graphical techniques 
to show the distribution of ultrasound parameters by the primary endpoint.  
  
10.3 Primary Analysis  
 
10.3.1  Analysis Population  
The population for primary analysis consists of all study participants  who 
have completed the LEAD ultrasound exams at treatment ‘baseline’ and after 3 weeks of treatment, who received at least 4 weeks of TKI and at 
least one dose of ICI  therapy , and for whom initial response can be 
evaluated per RECIST v1.1. If fewer than 20 of the 20 initially enrolled 
patients in arm 1 fulfill these criteria, additional patient may be enrolled 
Early Therapeutic Monitoring of Response to Therapy with Serial Ultrasound in Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma  
Version 9 .0 Page 23  of 31  1 May  2023  at the discretion of the Protocol Directors to have a complete dataset 
from 20 patients in arm 1 for primary analysis.  
 
10.3.2  Analysis Plan  
To address our primary objective, we will conduct a Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression as  our primary 
analysis. Specifically, our outcome, initial objective response, will be 
regressed on the change in each of the LEAD ultrasound tumor perfusion parameters after 3 weeks of treatment and relevant demographic and clinical characteristics. T he measurement of LEAD 
ultrasound tumor perfusion parameters  and the definition of their change 
are described in more detail below. We will not use selection techniques 
to choose variables . Rather, we will include  all factors  in our model 
jointly . We will evaluate the predictive ability of our model using area 
under the curve (AUC)  and calculate a 95% confidence interval for the 
AUC. Since our sample size is to o small to allow for separate training 
and testing datasets, we will utilize cross- validation techniques for 
evaluating predictive performance. 
 
Selection of lesions for LEAD ultrasound exams : 
Before the first ultrasound exam, the treating medical oncologist, a Protocol Director, or a designated radiologist select s up to 5 lesions per 
patient  (target lesions per RECIST v1.1) . At the treatment ‘baseline’ 
LEAD ultrasound exam  (up to 28 days prior to start of treatment) , 
perfusion of these 5 lesions is  measured. Additional lesions may be 
assessed at the discretion of the investigators, so that in the end up to 5 lesions are selected for repeat ultrasound exams that in the opinion of the investigator s lend themselves to reproducible tumor perfusion 
measurements . LEAD ultrasound tumor perfusion measurements  of the 
up to 5 lesions that were selected for ultrasound studies at the treatment ‘baseline’ exam  are performed again 3 weeks (+/ - 8 days) after start of 
treatment.  
 Quantification of tumor perfusion parameters : 
The following parameters are  computed from the LEAD ultrasound 
measurements for each lesion:  
• overall tumor perfusion: the integrated power within the tumor  
• average red cell flux: the integrated power within the tumor normalized by tumor size 
• tumor -to-background perfusion ratio: the ratio of the integrated 
power within the tumor to the integrated power in a same sized region in nearby healthy tissue.  
    
Early Therapeutic Monitoring of Response to Therapy with Serial Ultrasound in Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma  
Version 9 .0 Page 24  of 31  1 May  2023  Changes in tumor perfusion parameters after 3 weeks of treatment:  
Defined as relative change in these parameters, i.e., difference between 
time points divided by value at time point 1, expressed as percentage. 
For determining the relative change in several lesions of the same patient, the average of the relative changes in the up to 5 individual lesions is calculated.  
  
10.4 Secondary Analysis  
 
10.4.1  Analysis Population  
All patients who have completed at least one LEAD and Doppler ultrasound 
exam  at any time point. For correlation analyse s, patients are included for 
each analysis based on availability of data points for specific analyses. If 
fewer than 20 patients  in arm 1 and 10 patients in arm 2 fulfill these criteria  
for any secondary analysis, additional patient may be enrolled at the discretion of the Protocol Directors to have a complete dataset from 20 and 
10 patients for this  analysis , respectively . 
 
10.4.2  Analysis Plan  
To address our secondary objective , i.e., evaluating if there is an optimal 
ultrasound modality  to predict initial objective response in arm 1, we will utilize 
the same analysis approach as outlined above for the primary analysis. Here , 
we will use change in tumor perfusion parameters at 6 weeks as our 
independent variables and conduct two regression analyses: (1) using power 
Doppler  measurements and (2) using LEAD ultrasound measurements. 
AUCs between the two models will be compared using the nonparametric approach of DeLong for correlated AUC curves
43. In addition, we will compare 
AUCs between these models to the predictive model for the primary analysis.  
 To assess if there is an optimal time point for predicting initial objective 
response in arm 1, we will conduct Lasso regression models using tumor 
perfusion parameters for each time point ( treatment ‘ baseline’ , 3 weeks, 6 
weeks) separately for each imaging modality using a similar approach as outlined above.  Given the exploratory nature of these analyses, we will not 
adjust for multiple testing.  
 
For each arm, we will conduct correlation analysis for  change in perfusion 
parameters at 3 and 6 weeks and initial relative change in tumor burden 
(overall and per -lesion) , initial overall response, best overall response, and  
PFS until 12 months after initiating treatment by calculating either the 
Pearson r or Spearman rank correlation, as appropriate.  PFS is  estimated 
using the Kaplan- Meier method and the Kaplan- Meier curves will be 
presented.  
  
Early Therapeutic Monitoring of Response to Therapy with Serial Ultrasound in Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma  
Version 9 .0 Page 25  of 31  1 May  2023  Selection of lesions for ultrasound exams : 
The up to 5 lesions that were selected for ultrasound studies  for the primary 
analysis  are re-assessed 6 weeks (+/ - 15 days) after start of treatment and 
each lesion is assessed with both LEAD and power Doppler ultrasound  at all 
3 time points (treatment ‘baseline’, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks after initiating 
treatment . 
 Quantification and change of tumor perfusion parameters : defined in the 
same way as for the primary analysis for both power Doppler and LEAD ultrasound. 
 10.5 Sample Si ze 
Since this is an exploratory pilot study and we are not  formally test ing a specific 
research hypothes is, the sample size for each arm  has been  chosen based on 
practical considerations and estimated feasibility. However, for the primary analysis 
(arm 1), we consider a predictive model with a true AUC of at least 0.7 promising for 
predicting initial objective response. With 20 patients and assuming that 59% of patients have an objective response to treatment, a predictive model with a true AUC of at least 0.7 will have a margin of error of 0.14 so that the empirically determined  
AUC can range from 0.56 to 1. 
 10.6 Accrual estimates    
We estimate that 1 5 patients yearly are eligible for arm 1 and approximately 10 
patients for arm  2. By experience from previous similar imaging studies,  patients are 
motivated to participate in such studies, especially when they do not require extra 
study visits. However, taking into account attrition, we conservatively estimate that it will take 2 years to accrue 20 patients  in arm 1 and up to 10 patients in arm 2 who 
complete all ultrasound exams, receive treatment over the minimum  period, and will 
have an evaluable response per RECIST.  
 10.7 Criteria for future studies  
An AUC of at least 0.7 will be the minimum needed to design a follow -up study  and 
the predictive model that yields the best AUC will be selected for future studies. If 
different predictive models give equivalent AUCs, we will consider additional 
analyses (for example, random forests or Classification and Regression Tree [CART ]) to evaluate these models to determine if a specific model can be selected 
for further studies.  
If any predictive  model from this  pilot study has an AUC of at least 0.7, the next step 
will be to conduct a larger follow- up study in an independent cohort to validate the 
predictive model and determine its AUC with a  smaller margin of error.  The sample 
size and operating characteristics of the follow -up study will be determined based 
on findings from this pilot study and other data available at the time of designing the 
follow- up study. If the larger follow- up study is also deemed a success  (AUC at least 
0.7), to determine if tumor perfusion measurements by ultrasound are suitable for 
implementation, an adequately powered randomized clinical trial will  be required to

compared to current standard of care.

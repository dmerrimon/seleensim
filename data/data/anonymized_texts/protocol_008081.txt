OVERALL RATIONALE FOR REVISED PROTOCOL 07:
Based on discussion with medical team and key investigat ors, the newly proposed e ndpoint of 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) is more clinical meaningful and suitable than the previous endpoint 
of progression-free survival ( PFS) in terms of reflecting the e fficacy of nivolumab as neoadjuvant 
therapy.
During Protocol Revision 06, the inclusion/exclusion criteria s equencing was inadvertently 
changed from a lettering scheme t o bullets. Per Protocol Revision 07, this has been corrected and 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria are again sequenced with lette rs.

Study Phase: 1/2
Research Hypothesis (A):  Nivolumab, in the neoadjuvant setting, will be safe and tolerab le in subjects with select 
virus positive and virus-negative tumors.
Research Hypothesis (B):  Treatment with nivolumab alone or in combination with either ipilimumab, BMS-986016
(relatlimab), or daratumumab will lead to clinically meaningful  tumor reductions, as measured by objective response 
rate and duration of response, in subjects with metastatic or un resectable tumors.

−Cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancers
•In the metastatic cohort (nivolumab monotherapy), to evaluate t he investigator-assessed objective response rate 
(ORR) in subjects with the following diseases:−Metastatic or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 
−Metastatic or Recurrent EBV related gastric cancer
−Metastatic or Recurrent Merkel Cell Carcinoma
−Metastatic or Recurrent cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancers
−Metastatic or recurrent HPV positive cell cancer of the head an d neck (SCCHN)

follow-up collection has concluded.
Study Population:
Inclusion Criteria:
a) Histopathologic confirmation of the following tumor types
i) Merkel Cell Carcinoma 
(1). MCPyV status will be determined after enrollment
ii) EBV-Positive Gastric or Gastro-Esophageal junction carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma arising from 
the lower esophagus) 
(1). For subjects in the metastatic cohorts (monotherapy only) w ith gastric tumor types, EBV positivity

Study Assessments: 
Safety: 
Safety assessments at baseline will include a medical history to be obtained to capture relevant underlying conditions. 
Baseline examinations should include signs and symptoms, weight , height, ECOG Performance Status, BP, HR, 
temperature, and respiratory rate should be performed within 14  days prior to first dose. Concomitant medications 
will als o be collected from within 14 days prior to first dose and thro ugh the study treatment. Baseline safety laboratory 
assessments should be done within 14 days prior to the first dos e. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety if they have received any  study drug. Toxicity assessments will be performed
continuously during the treatment phase. On-study assessments including weight, height, ECOG Performance Status, BP, HR, temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation by  pulse oximetry at rest and after exertion will be 
performed. On-study safety laboratory assessments will also be performed.

Efficacy: 
Tumor imaging assessments for ongoing study tr eatment decisions will be completed by the investigator using 
RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 criteria.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: Sample size determination is not based on statistical power calculation.
1) Neoadjuvant cohort: 
The SCCHN tumor types will contain 21 HPV-positive and 21 HPV-negative evaluable subjects. MCC and cervical, 
vaginal, or vulvar cancers tumor types will contain 21 evaluabl e subjects each. A sampl e size of 21 sub jects can detect, 
with more than 66% and 89% probability, a safety event that occurs at an incident rate of 5% and 10%, respectively. Assuming 10%, 15%, and 20% for pathologic complete response rat e, a sample size of 21 can detect, more than 89%, 
97% and 99% probability, at least one pathologic complete response respectively.
2) Recurrent/metastatic monotherapy cohort:
HPV+ SCCHN, GYN, MCC and NPC tumor types in the recurrent/metas tatic cohort will contain 23 subjects. Table 1 
shows the probabilities of observing 0, 1 or 2 responders and ≥3 responders assuming 5%, 20% and 30% true r esponse 
rate of ORR. Table 2 shows two-sided 95% exact CI using Clopper- Pearson methods based on observed 3, 4, and 
5 responders out of 23 subjects.
EBV+ Gastric tumor type will contain 12 subjects, due to the lo w prevalence. Table 3  shows the precision of the 
estimation of ORR based on the two sided 95% exact CI using Clo pper-Pearson methods based on 1, 2, 3, 4, and 
5 responders out of 12 subjects.

3) Recurrent/metastatic combination cohort:
The HPV+ SCCHN, MCC, and NPC tum or types in the recurrent/metas tatic cohort will each contain approximately 
40 subjects that will be enrolled to the Combo A treatment arm. Patients with cervical cancer and anogenital HPV 
associated tumors (vulvar/vaginal/anal canal/penile) tumor type s will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio t o one of two dosing 
schema (Combo A or Combo B). Each dosing schema will contain approximately 40 subjects.
Subjects with HPV+ SCCHN with prior anti PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 treatment will be enrolled in Metastatic 
Combination Cohort (Combo C). Combo C will contain approximatel y 40 subjects.
Additionally, the metastatic cervical Combination B cohort will  be expanded to treat a pproximately 50 subjects as 
first-line treatment for thei r recurrent/metastatic disease if unfit or unsuitable to receive platinum-based therapy and 
approximately 20 subjects as second-line treatment for their re current/metastatic SCC of the cervix to confirm the 
efficacy signal. With Combo B and the Combo B expansion, there should be a total of approximately 75 subjects with 
first-line treatment and approx imately 35 subjects with second- line treatment of cervical cancer (approximately 110
cervical subjects total).
Approximately 40 I-O naive HPV-negative, -indeterminate, and -p ositive SCCHN subjects will be enrolled to the 
Combo D treatment arm. In this study, an ORR in excess of 10% will be considered of clinical interest. Assuming the 
true ORR is 25%, 40 subjects in each tumor type can provide approximately 79.8% power to reject the null hypothesis that the true ORR is 10%, considering a 2-sided alpha of 5%. In  addition Table 5 shows the precision of the estimation 
of ORR based on the two sided 95% exact CI using Clopper Pearson methods based on 8, 9, 12, 16 and 20 responders 
out of 40 sub jects. At  observed more than or equal to 9 responders, i.e., ORR ≥22.5%, the lower bound of the 95% 
CI excludes 10%.
Due to the low prevalence of EBV+ Gastric tumor types and the c urrent investigation of this tumor type in other 
BMS-sponsored studies, combination cohorts in this study will n o longer include EBV+ Gastric tumor type. Sample 
sizes of each treatment arm in each tumor type are summarized in Table 4.

Endpoints:
Primary Endpoints:
Neoadjuvant cohort : 
•The safety and tolerability objective will be measured by the incidence  of drug-related s elect AEs and drug-r elated 
SAEs.
•Rate of surge ry delay, which is defined as the pr oportion of subjects in the neoadjuvant cohort with surgery 
delayed > 4 weeks from the planned surgery date or planned star t date for chemoradiatio n due to a drug-related 
AE will be reported for each tumor type.
Metastatic cohort (monotherapy and combination therapies) : The objective response rate (ORR). ORR is defined 
as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of  confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) divided by the number of treated subjects. BOR is defined as the best response designation recorded between the 
date of first dose and the d ate of the initial objectively documented tumor progression per investigator assessment 
using RECIST 1.1 criteria or the date of the last tumor assessment date prior to subsequent therapy. In this study, an ORR in excess of 10% will be c onsidered of clinical interest, a nd an ORR of 25% or greater will be considered of 
strong clinical interest.

Secondary Endpoints:
Metastatic cohort (monotherapy and combination therapies) : 
•Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from first confirmed response (CR or PR) to the date of the 
initial ob jectively documented tumor progression as determined per investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 
criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Sub jects who did not start subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy and die wit hout a reported prior progression will be considered to have pr ogressed on the date of their 
death. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Subjects who did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die  will be censored on the date they were treated. 
Subjects who started any subs equent anti-cancer therapy prior t o death and without a prior reported progression 
will be censored at the last tumor assessment prior to or on th e date of initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy. DOR will only be evaluated in subjects with objective response of CR or PR
•Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of death. A subject who has not died 
will be censored at last known date alive. 
•Investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of 
the first documented tumor progression, as determined by invest igators (per RECIST 1.1), or death due to any 
cause. Subjects who die without a reported prior progression wi ll be considered to have progressed on the date of 
their death. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Subjects who did not have any on study tumor assessments and di d not die will be censored on the date they were 
treated. Subjects who s tarted any subsequent anti-cancer therap y prior to death and without a prior reported 
progression will be censored at the last tumor assessment prior  to or on the date of initiation of the subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy.
Exploratory Endpoints:
Neoadjuvant cohort: 
•The percent change from baseline of immune cells and the percen t change from baseline of select immune 
activation/inhibitory molecules of viral-specific T cells in tu mor specific subsets of nivolumab treated subj ects 
will be evaluated.  
•Recurrence-free survival (RFS), which is defined in Section 8.3.3 .
•The percent change in tumor volume from baseline after two dose s of neoadjuvant nivolumab is defined as the 
ratio of the change in tumor volume and the baseline tumor volu me.
•The proportion of treated subjects  who experiences pathologic c omplete response will be used to determine 
pathologic response rate of tumors after two doses of neoadjuva nt nivolumab in HPV pos itive and negative 
SCCHN, resectable Merkel Cell Carcinoma, and cervical, vaginal,  or vulvar cancer. Pathological complete 
response (pCR) is defined as the absence of residual viable invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation 
of the complete resected tumor specimen and all sampled regiona l lymph nodes following completion of 
neoadjuvant systemic therapy.
Metastatic cohort (monotherapy and combination therapies) : 
•The safety and tolerability objective will be measured by the i ncidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, 
deaths and laboratory abnormalities.
•Pre and post treatment EBV DNA levels w ill be collected in the subjects with EBV positive gastric canc er and 
nasopharyngeal carcino ma. The change in EBV DNA levels will be used to determine the effect of BMS -936558 
(nivolumab).

Analyses:
Analyses for primary endpoints: 
Neoadjuvant cohort: 
•Analyses of drug-related select AEs and drug-related SAEs are discussed in Section of safety analyses.
•Rate of surgery delay will be summarized by binomial response ra tes and their corresponding two-sided 95% 
exact CIs using Clopper-Pearson method. 
Metastatic cohort (monotherapy and combination therapies): 
•The investigator assessed ORR in the metastatic cohort will be summarized by binomial response rates and their 
corresponding two-sided 95% exact CIs using Clopper-Pearson met hod. 
Analyses for secondary endpoints: Metastatic cohort (monotherapy and combination therapies):

investigator assessments) and OS. Median PFS or OS along with 95% CI will be constructed based on a log-log 
transformed CI for the survivor function. Rates at some fixed t ime points will be derived from the Kaplan Meier 
estimate and corresponding confidence interval will be derived based on Greenwood formula for variance 
derivation and on log-log transformation applied on the survivo r function.

Methods for exploratory endpoints will be discussed in details in the statistical analysis plan.
Safety Analyses
Safety analyses will be pe rformed in all treated  subjects. Desc riptive statistics of safety  will be prese nted using 
NCI CTCAE version 4. All on-study AEs, drug-related, AEs, SAEs a nd drug-related SAEs will be tabulated using 
worst grade per NCI CTCAE version 4 criteria by system organ cl ass and MedDRA preferred term. On-study lab 
parameters including hematology, chemistry, liver function, thy roid function, and renal function will be summarized 
using worst grade per NCI CTCAE version 4 criteria.

interval.
Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The nivolumab, ipilimumab, BMS-986016 (relatlimab), and daratumu mab concentration data obtained in this study 
may be combined with data from other studies in any of the clin ical development programs (nivolumab, ipilimumab, 
BMS-986016, and daratumumab) to develop or refine a population PK model. The models may be used to evaluate 
the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic covariates on the PK of nivolumab or other compounds  and to determine measures 
of individual exposure (such a s steady-state peak, trough, and time-averaged concentration). In addition, model

1 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE
1.1 Study Rationale
Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1; CD279) is a cell s urface signaling molecule that delivers 
inhibitory signals that regul ate the balance between T cell act ivation and tolerance by interacting 
with its ligands, PD-L1 (CD274; B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273).  PD-1 is a 55 kD type I 
transmembrane protein that is a member of the CD28 family of T- cell regulatory receptors, which 
also includes CTLA-4, ICOS, and BTLA.1PD-1 is primarily expressed on activated T cells, B 
cells, and myeloid cells.2Its ligands, PD-L1 (B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273), have 
been shown to down-regulate T- cell activation upon binding to PD-1 in both murine and human 
systems.3,4PD-1 contains an intracellular membrane proximal immunoreceptor  tyrosine inhibitory 
motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal immunoreceptor tyrosine-base d switch motif (ITSM), that 
when phosphorylated, delivers a negative signal to the lymphocy te by the recruitment of SHP-2 to 
the phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the ITSM in its cytoplas mic region.5,6
Evidence for a negative regulatory role of PD-1 comes from stud ies of PD-1-deficient mice. PD-1-
deficient mice devel op various auto immune phenotypes, including dilated cardiomyopathy and a 
lupus-like syndrome with arthritis and nephritis.7,8,9The emergence of these autoimmune 
phenotypes is depende nt upon the genetic background of the mous e strain; many of these 
phenotypes emerge at different times and show variable penetran ce. In addition to the phenotypes 
of null mutations, PD-1 inhibition by antibody-mediated blockad e in several murine models has 
been found to play  a role in the develop ment of autoimmune dise ases such as encephalomyelitis, 
graft-versus-host disease, and type I diabetes.10,11,12Taken together, these results suggest that 
PD-1 blockade has the potential to activate anti-self T-cell re sponses, but these responses are 
variable and dependent upon vari ous host genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or inhibition is 
not accompanied by a universal loss of tolerance to self-antige ns. 
Preclinical animal models of tumors have shown that blockade of PD-1 by monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) can enhance the anti-t umor immune response and result in  tumor reject ion. This suggests 
that host mechanisms limit the antitumor response.13,14,15,16,17,18
In humans, PD-L1 is constituti vely expressed on macrophage-lineage cells, activated T cells, lung, 
vascular endothelial cells, and p lacental syncytio trophoblasts.19Aberrant expression of PD-L1 by 
tumor cells has been re ported in a number of human malignancies.20,21,22,23,24,25,26PD-L1 
expressed by tumor cells has been shown to enhance apoptosis of  activated tumor-specific T cells 
in vitro.27Moreover, the expression of PD-L 1 may protect the tumor cells f rom the induction of 
apoptosis by effector T cells.28Retrospective analyses of several human tumor types suggest tha t 
tumor over-expression (as measured by immunohistochemistry) of PD-L1 may permit immune 
evasion by tumors. In renal cell carcinoma, high surface expression levels of PD-L1 on tumo r cells 
are related to tumor aggressiveness. Patients with high tumor a nd/or lymphocyte PD-L1 levels are 
4.5 times more likely to die from their cancer than patients ex hibiting low levels of PD-L1 
expression.29

BMS-936558 nivolumab
Nivolumab is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype, mAb that binds to PD-1. Blockade of the PD-1 
pathway by nivolumab was studied using the mixed lymphocyte rea ction (MLR). PD-1 blockade 
resulted in a reproducible enhancement of both proliferation an d IFN-γ release in the MLR.30The 
effect of nivolumab on antigen-specific recall response was inv estigated using a CMV-
restimulation assay with human peripheral blo od mononu clear cells (PBMCs) and was evaluated 
by ELISA. These data indicated that nivolumab, versus an isotyp e-matched control antibody, 
augmented IFN-g secreti on from CMV-specific memory T cells in a dose-dependent manner. 
1.1.1 Disease Background
Study CA209358 is an open label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 trial t o investigate the safety and efficacy 
of nivolumab as a single agent or in combination with either ipi limumab, relatlimab (anti-LAG3 
antibody), or daratumumab in viral positive and viral negative t umor types - Epstein Barr Virus 
(EBV) positive gastric cancer, EBV positive nasopharyngeal canc er (NPC), cervical cancer, HPV 
positive and negative squamous cell cancer (SCC) of the head and neck (SCCHN), anogenital 
HPV associated cancers (vaginal, vul var, anal canal, penile), and P olyomavirus positive Merkel 
cell cancer (pMCC). 
1.1.1.1 EBV Positive Tumors
Gastric Cancer
As of 2012, gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy in the world with 952,000 cases 
globally and is the third leading cause of cancer death with 72 3,000 deaths.31Gastric cancer often 
presents with advanced disease upon diagnosis (except in countr ies like Japan and Korea where 
early detecti on is common). In about 20-30% of cases, patients will present with resectable disease 
but in many of these, intraoperative discovery of lymph node me tastasis is common and where 
curative surgery is possible, the recurrence rate after resecti on is high. For resectable disease, 
treatment options include neo a nd adjuvant chemotherapy with fl uoropyrimidine, a platinum agent, 
and an anthracycline or a fluoropyrimidine in combination with radiation for adjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy. Despite these treatment options, the 5-year survival for Stage II-III gastric 
cancer remains 9-46%.32For patients developing advanced and metastatic disease, the re ported 1-
year survival is approximately  30% with a media n survival of patients receiving treatment of 8 to 
14 months and those receiving best supportive care alone only 3  months.33
Recent analyses from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project hav e proposed dividing gastric 
cancer into four subtypes, tumors positive for Epstein–Barr viru s, which display recurrent PIK3CA 
mutations, extreme DNA hypermethylation, and amplification of J AK2, CD274 (also known as 
PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known as PD-L2); microsatellite unsta ble tumors, which show 
elevated mutation rates, including mutations of genes encoding targetable oncogenic signaling 
proteins; genomically stable tumors, which are enriched for the diffuse histological variant and 
mutations of RHOA or fusions involving RHO-f amily GTPase-activating proteins; and tumors 
with chromosomal instability, which show marked aneuploidy and focal amplification of receptor 
tyrosine kinases.34TCGA classified 26 (8.8%) of the 295 gastric cancers samples ev aluated as 
EBV positive, matching a larger meta-analysis which estimated t he prevalence of EBV positive

gastric cancers, as assessed by in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small RNA, at 8.7% (95% 
CI: 7.5, 10.0) out of 70 trials and 15,952 cases.35The EBV positive subtype demonstrated enriched 
amplifications a t 9p24.1, a locus that cont ains JAK2, PD-L1, an d PD-L2, which both bind PD-1, 
the target of nivolumab. Classification by molecular subtype wo uld allow for selecti on of gastric 
subtypes that may be more likely to respond to targeted therapi es compared to the WHO gastric 
cancer subsets of papillary, tubul ar, mucinous (colloid) and po orly cohesive carcinomas.36Clinical 
observations of EBV positive gastric cancer include distinct clinicopathologic characteristics, 
including male predominance, preferential location in the gastr ic cardia or postsurgical gastric 
stump, lymphocytic infiltration, a lower frequency of lymph nod e metastases, and a diffuse type 
of histology, as well as a more favorable prognosis.37,38
EBV Positive NPC
As of 2012, there wer e 86,691 cases of NPC with 50828 deaths.31Several etiologic factors have 
been proposed including diet, genetic factors, chromosome loss,  and HPV, but EBV appears to be 
the primary etiologic agent.39,40, 41The current WHO classification for NPC reflects the 
importance of EBV as it classifies NPC into the following histop athologic types:42
1) Keratinizing squamous cell car cinoma (WHO Type I):  The sporad ic form of nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma most commonly is the keratinizing subtype (WHO Type I );
2) Nonkeratinizing carcinoma which is subdivided into the differe ntiated (Type II) and 
undifferentiated (Type  III) form s. The endemic form of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, found in 
Southeast Asia, is commonly the undifferentiated, nonkeratinizi ng subtype (Type III). This is 
strongly associated with EBV and has a more favorable prognosis  than other types. 
3) Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma: Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma was added to the WHO 
classification of head and neck tumors in 2005. 
Along with T and N stage, quantification of EBV DNA levels is a  prognostic factor, with higher 
levels having a worse prognosis. Stage I-II with low DNA (< 400 0 copies/mL) have a 5 year 
survival rate of  91 % wher eas patients with the same stage but h igh DNA (> 4000 copies/mL) have 
a 5 year survival r ate of 64%; for p atients with Stage III-IV the rates are 66% an d 54% 
respectively.43The presence of detectable post- treatment EB V DNA, which may re flect 
microscopic residual tumor, appears to provide an even greater estimate of the risk of disease 
recurrence and death than pretreatment EBV DNA.44,45
Current treatment options include radiation for Stage I disease , combined chemotherapy, usually 
cisplatin, and radiation therapy for Stages II-IVB. The 5-year overall survival (OS) for 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma according to disease stage in a contem porary case series was 90%, 
84%, 75%, and 58% for stage I through IV, respectively.46For recurrent disease, surgical resection 
can be an option. For non-surgical disease, chemotherapy doublets have produced response rates (between 60% and 74%) with no statist ically signif icant differences in progression-free survival 
(PFS) (median 5.0 to 6.6 months) or overall survival (median 19 to 21 months and 3-year survival

chemotherapy, there is no standard of care with several Phase 2  trials with single agents such as 
capecitabine48, irinotecan49, docetaxel50, gemcitabine51, and pemetrexed.52
1.1.1.2 HPV Positive Tumors
HPV Positive SCCHN
Head and neck carcinomas (HNC) are the fifth most common cancer  in the world, with increasing 
incidence.53,54In 2014 in the United States, the American Cancer Society estim ates 55,000 new 
cases are diagnosed and approximately 12,000 deaths due to this  cause occur yearly.55HNCs 
describe malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract which in clude squamous cell carcinomas 
(SCCHN) of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, pharynx and larynx. Wh ile tobacco and alcohol use are 
the most common risk factors for HNCs, Epstein-Barr virus and hu man papilloma virus (HPV) 
may also pl ay a rol e i n  th e devel opm ent of car cinomas of the nasopha rynx and squamous cell 
carcinomas of the oropharynx, respect ively.53,54, 56,57,58,59
A TNM-based classification is used to stage all SCCHN for tr eatment and outcome measures 
(American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] Cancer Staging Manua l 7th edit ion, 2010). At 
initial dia gnosis, SCCHN can be of early stage (ES - 33%; Stage I/II), loca lly advanced 
(LA - 52 - 60%; stage  III/IV-A/IV-B ) or metas tatic (met - ∼ 10%; Stage IV-C). With standard of 
care treatment, the 5-year survival for ES is 80%, for LA it is  50% and for metastatic disease, it is 
25%.60Approximately 50% of the treated population returns with recurr ent or refractory disease. 
For recurrent or refractory disease, the 1-year survival rate i s 5% - 33% by various estimates with 
a median OS of 6 to 9 months.61,62Metastatic and recurrent HNC that is no longer amenable to 
local surgical/radiation therapy causes substantial morbidity a nd high mortality, with a median 
PFS of ≤6 months due to the lack of effective therapeutic options.63,64,65
Treatment of recurrent or metastatic disease consists of cytotoxic chemotherapies such as 
methotrexate, organoplatinum compounds, fluorouracil (5-FU), or  taxanes - either alone or in 
combination - and the biologic agent cetuximab. Patients whose d isease progresses after platinum 
based therapy have a poor prognosis. In a retrospective analysi s of 151 subjects with platinum-
refractory recurrent metastatic SCCHN, 68 patients (45%) receiv ing best supportive care had a 
median OS of 56 days (95% CI, 46 - 67 days) whereas in 43 subject s (28%), second line 
chemotherapy (platinum based or methotrexate) had no ORR and median OS was 107 days (95% 
CI, 83 - 135 days).66In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cet uximab 
(Erbitux ®), for use as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or metasta tic HNC who have 
progressed after platinum-based therapy based on a single-arm, multicenter clinical trial in 103 
patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN who had documented disease progression within 30 
days of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. The objective re sponse rate (ORR) was 13% 
(95% confidence interval 7% - 21%) and the median durati on of res ponse was 5.8 months (range 
1.2 - 5.8 months).67According to national guidelines , other single agents appropria te for this 
population include paclitaxel, docetaxel, and methotrexate, who se response rates range from

15 - 40%.68,69In a Phase 2 trial in subjects who progressed within 3 months s ince last platinum 
administration for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNC , the addition of docetaxel to 
cetuximab resulted in a partial response rate of 11% ind icating that combination therapies with 
cetuximab in the platinum refractory setting have limited effic acy.70In 2011, the FDA approved 
cetuximab in combination with platinum-based therapy with 5-FU i n patients with recurrent or 
metastatic HNC based on an improvement of median OS from of 10. 1 months compared to 7.4 
months for patients treated with platinum/5-FU alone.67
Despite the numerous treatment options, metastatic or recurrent  HNC remains an area of high 
unmet medical need as patients who progress after treatment (re fractory or platinum-resistant 
disease) have the worst prognosis with median OS of 3 - 4 months  and 1 year survival rate of 
< 5%.71In conclusion, there is no effective standard of care that prov ides survival benefits beyond 
4 - 6 months in second line platinum refractory recurrent or meta static SCCHN.
HPV-associated head and neck cancer, largely presenting in the oropharynx has been increasing 
in incidence.61,63In the US, some two-thirds of patients with oropharynx cancer ha ve 
HPV-associated tumors. In 2010 approximately 4,200 squamous can cers of the oropharynx (OPC) 
caused by tobacco and alcohol and 8,400 new HPV-associated orop harynx cancer will present for 
treatment. HPV status is an independent prognostic factor for O S and PFS among patients with 
squamous-cell OPC.72In this study, 64% of OPC patients had HPV-positive tumors, as measured 
in-situ hybridization for the HPV subtype 16. The presence of H PV DNA correlated well with p16 
expression (kappa = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.87). Patients with HPV-positive tumors had 
significantly increased OS as w ell as PFS compared to patients  with HPV-negative tumors. 
Furthermore, after adjusting for demographics, T stage, N stage , and smoking, patients with HPV-
positive OPC had a 58% reduction in the risk of death and a 51% reduction in r isk of progression 
or death. Patients with HPV-negative tumors had a 25.1% r eduction in OS at 3 years (57.1% vs
82.4%) when compared to patients with HPV-positive tumor s.63Loca l-regional relapse at 3 years 
was 21% higher in patients with HPV-negative tumors: 35.1% (95% CI: 26.4 - 43.8) versus 13.6% 
(95% CI: 8.9 - 18.3) for HPV-positive tumors (p < 0.001). These poor outcomes for HPV-negative 
patients occur despite the gradual trend toward increasing intensification of treatment with altered 
fractionation schema,64concurrent chemoradiation,57,65multi-drug induction chemotherapy,73
and targeted molecular therapies.58For patients with HPV-negative tumors, altering the method 
of radiation delivery and the dosing and/ or types of concurrent chemotherapy is not s ufficient to 
improve oncologic outcomes. 
Because HPV-associate d head and neck cancers more frequently pr esent in a younger population 
and seem particularly responsive to tr eatment with a b etter overall survival,74attention has focused 
on the subpopulation of > 10 pack-year smoking and N2-N3, whose prognosis is worse 
(60% - 70% 2 year PFS) as well as HPV-negative HNC patients, whos e clinical outcome has not 
improved despite intensification of standard chemotherapeutic a gents and combinations. Thus 
novel therapeutic approaches, such as immune modulation and blo ckade of suppressive immune 
cells and signals, are needed in clinical evaluation.

Cervical, Vaginal, Vulvar, Anal Canal, and Penile Cancers
In the United States, almost 4900 cases of vulvar cancer are diagnosed each year, with over 1000 of 
those women expected to die from the disease; for cervical canc er in the US there are 12,000 new 
cases of invasive cervical cancer and approximately 4000 cancer-related deaths occur each year.56
HPV infection is associated with the development of cervical, v ulvar, anal canal, and penile 
cancers.75HPV 16 and 18 are the most commo n subtypes for vulvar, anal canal, and penile cancers; 
HPV 16, 18, 33, 6 and 31 are the 5 most frequently observed HPV types for cervical cancer. 
Whereas cervical cancer HPV infection occurs in nearly 100% of patients76, HPV associated 
squamous vulvar cancer affects younger women77and is a warty squamous cell compared to 
keratinizing or differentiated. Onl y 70% of cases are associated  with HPV infection.78
Treatment for vulvar or vaginal cancer is typically s urgical resectio n, though chemoradiotherapy 
is another option.79The 5-year survival for vulvar cancer depends on spread of dise ase, Local 
86%, Regional 54%, and Distant 16%.80Treatment of recurrent disease includes surgical 
reexcision or resection and platinum based chemotherapy for met astatic disease. Recurrences are 
more likely local compared to distant (5.7%) and the 5-year sur vival rate was 60% for perineal 
recurrences, 27% for inguinal and pelvic recurrences, 15% for d istant recurrences, and 14% for 
multiple recurrences.81
Treatment for cervical cancer is typically surgery for Stages I A - IIA1 and concurrent 
chemoradiation for Stages IB2 to IVA. The 5-year survival r ate for cervical cancer depends on 
stage: IA 93%, IB 80%, IIA 63%, IIB58%, IIIA 35%, IIIB 32%, IVA  16%, and IVB 15%.82
Treatment of recurrent disease is typically with surgery for re sectable disease or chemotherapy 
plus bevacizumab, which improved ORR (48% vs 36%) and mOS (17 vs  13.3 months) compared 
to chemotherapy alone.83After first line chemotherapy, there is no standard of care tha t has 
demonstrated improved benefit over best supportive care.  
Anal cancer comprises 2.5% of all digestive system malignancies in the United States; 8080 new 
cases are diagnosed annually, with 1080 deaths.84The incidence of anal cancer in the general 
populatio n has increased over the last 30 years. A higher incidence has been associated with female 
gender, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), lifetime num ber of sexual partners, genital 
warts, cigarette smoking, receptive anal intercourse, and infec tion with human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV).85
Anal squamous cell cancer is believed to be directly linked to t he presence of a complex 
inflammatory process most commonly caused by HPV infection (par ticularly with serotypes 16 
and 18) in the histologically unique area of the anal squamocol umnar epithelium.86
United S tates Surveill ance, Epidemiol ogy and End Results (SEER) data rev eal approximately 
7000 to 8000 new anal cancer cases (64% female)  and 1000 deaths recorded annually.87About 
91% are believed to be caused  by HPV. With anal cancer presen tations at all stages, 5-year survival 
is 66.4%. A pproximately 48% of patients have localized disease at presentation, and 5-year

survival in this group is 80.7%, wh ereas in those who present w ith metastatic disease, 5-year 
survival is 30.4%.87
Consensus-based guidelines from NCCN and ESMO88recommend cisplatin plus FU as a first-line 
regimen. If this regimen fails, no other regimens have been sho wn to be effective for metastatic 
disease.
Penile cancer is rare in Western countries. The American Cancer  Society estimated that in 2016, 
2,030 pen ile cancers would be diagnos ed in the United States, w ith 340 deaths.84This death rate 
of 17% underscores the seriousness of this cancer; for comparis on, only  3% of men with  prostate 
cancer die from this disease. About 63% of cases of penile canc er are believed to be caused by 
HPV.The prognosis of penile cancer is primarily related to the pres ence or absence of inguinal node 
metastasis. Untreated patients with inguinal metastases rarely survive 2 years. Of those with 
clinically palpable adenopathy and histologically proven metast ases, 20 to 50% are alive at 5 years 
following inguinal lymphadenectomy. The results are even better  when the extent of the nodal 
involvement is considered. An 82 to 88% 5-year survival rate has  been reported when only 1 to 3 
lymph nodes are involved.
89
Men with a history of penile cancer are at risk for both localized recurrence and distant metastases, 
and up to 30% of all patients will subsequently recur.90Partial or total penile amputation is 
preferred for men with a local recurrence, whereas individualiz ed chemotherapy treatment based 
on the patient’s performance status and symptoms91is preferred for patients presenting with or 
who develop metastatic disease. Platinum based chemotherapies r esults in overall response rates 
of up to 30 to 38% in patients with distant metastatic penile ca rcinoma.92,93,94,95For patients who 
progress after their initial chemotherapy, the prognosis is poo r with a median survival of less than 
six months.96
1.1.1.3 Polyomavirus Positive Merkel Cell Cancer (pMCC)
According to a review of the SEER database, there were 3,870 case s of Merkel cell carcinoma 
(MCC) between 1973 and 2006.97The review concluded that stage of disease was the best 
predictor of survival and the 10-year relative survival rate wa s higher in women than men (64.8% 
vs 50.5%, p < 0.001). For advanced disease, however, the 2-year survival r ate for patients with 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IV disease is e stimated to be 26%.98
Clinical observations have linked UV exposure and immune status  to merkel cell carcinoma based 
on the observations that diagnosis occurs in the sun-exposed ar eas of skin in older individuals as 
well as in patients wit h immunocompromised states.99,100,101Another etiologic factor is Merkel 
Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) which can integrate into tumor genome prior to the clonal expansion 
of tumor cells.102,103

those who did not with a median survival of 63 months vs 45 mont hs with pronounced 
improvement for patients with tumors lager than 2 cm (median su rvival 50 months vs

patients with resected MCC.105For metastatic disease, the NCCN recommends cisplatin or 
carboplatin with or without etopos ide, topotecan, or the combin ation of cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin/epirubicin, and vincristine. Metastatic disease is incurable with chemotherapy and 
overall survival estimates for patients with metastatic disease  come from single institution 
publications with small sample sizes, often less than 10106,107,108, highlighting an unmet med ical 
need. 
Overall, this trial will examine the activity of nivolumab, alon e or in combination with either 
ipilimumab, relatlimab, or daratumumab i n viral positive and vir al negative tumor types including: 
EBV positive gastric cancer, EBV positive NPC, HPV positive and  negative SCCHN, HPV 
associated cervical cancer, anogenita l HPV associated cancers (vagin al, vulvar, anal, penile, rectal)
and Polyomavirus positive Merkel cell carcinoma (pMCC). These tu mor types may be more likely 
to respond to nivolumab which blocks the interaction of PDL-1/P D-L2 and P D-1, in two settings, 
a neoadjuvant or window of opportunity cohort in patients with resectable disease and a cohort of 
patients with metastatic dis ease who have progressed after one line of therapy or refused standard 
of care. 
1.1.2 Infection and TumorigenesisThe establishment of a virus as the inducer of cellular transfo rmation
109by Petyon Rous in the 
e a r l y  2 0 t h  c e n t u r y  p a v e d  t h e  w a y  f o r  m o d e r n  t u m o r  b i o l o g y .  S i n c e Rous’ observation, many 
cancers of different origins have been linked to chronic viral infections that are partly responsible 
for driving tumorigenesis through several mechanisms, including  the disruption of tumor
suppressor proteins such as p53 and Rb, activation of cellular proliferation pathways, and 
inhibiting the apoptotic machinery.110Two major classes of virus, Human Papilloma virus (HPV) 
and Eps tein-Barr virus (EBV), are associated with ∼670,000 oncological cases per year, 
worldwide.110
1.1.2.1 HPV
Promotion of tumorigenesis by HPV is mediated by two key viral proteins, E6 and E7, both of 
which target cell cycle regul ation, proliferation, and a poptosis pathways that drive cells toward 
transformation. The viral E6 protein binds to E6-AP, an ubiquiti n ligase, resulting in degradation 
of p53 protein.111In addition, E6, binds to histone acetyltransferases p300, ADA3 , and CREB 
binding protein (CBP) preventing acetylation of p53 and inhibit ing the transcription of 
p53-responsive genes. E6 has als o been shown to inhibit apoptot ic signaling by binding tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor (TNFR1), FAS-associated protei n with death domain (FADD) 
and caspase 8, and through the degradation of pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK. Direct killing of cells 
through IFN is inhibited by E6 through inhibition of IRF3.112

The HPV protein E7 also targets a tumor suppressor, retinoblastoma (Rb), leading to its 
inactivation and resulting in constitutive activation of E2F-re sponsive genes. Further disruption of 
cell cycle control by E7 is achieved by inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Similar to 
E6, E7 results in cellular immune escape by inhibiting IFN sign aling.112
1.1.2.2 EBV
Similar to HPV, infection of host cells with EBV may lead to th eir immortalizat ion through 
multiple mechanisms of dysregulated cellular proliferation and apoptosis. The EBV-encoded 
protein EBNA-3C binds to several cell-cycle regulatory proteins , including cyclin D1, cyclin D2, 
cyclin D3, cyclin A, and CtBP. In addition, EBNA-3C negatively regulates cyc linB1 activity 
through a p53-dependent mechanism. The cumulative effects of EB NA-3C drive the infected cell 
into an uncontrolled proliferative state.113In addition, the LMP1 viral protein has transformational 
properties through its activation of the NF-kB pathway.114
1.1.2.3 Polyomavirus
Three proteins encoded by the polyomavirus, large T, middle T, and s mall T, have ro les in inducing 
transformation of virally infected cells. Large T antigen binds  to the tumor suppressor Rb inducing 
a block in apoptosis.115Middle T antigen induces cellular transformation in conjunction  with large 
and small T t hrough activation of cellular k inases, such as PI3 K and PLCg.116Sm all  T antigen 
binds to the translational repressor 4E-BP1, resulting in dysre gulated cap-dependent translation 
through activation of eIF4e.117
Many viral proteins, including HPV E6, E7 and EBV and polyoma v irus proteins, EBNA-1, 
EBNA-3A, are immunogenic proteins and T cells that recognize vi ral protein epitopes can be 
found in the circulation of infected patients.118,119The existence of viral-reactive T cells in cancer 
patients with viral-positive tumors is important, as anti-tumor immunity may be driven by these T 
cells, in addition to T cells that are specific to tumor-associ ated antigens.
The mechanisms of tolerance found in tumor-specific T cells, in cluding expression of PD-1, have 
been shown to be similar to viral-specific T cells.120However, the ability of viral antigen-specific 
T cells to med iate anti-tum or immunity leading to tumor b urden reduction is unknown in human 
tumors. The rationale for targeting virally-infected tumors is described below.
1.1.3 Rationale for Nivolumab in the Neoadjuvant Setting
One of the primary objectives of this protocol is to assess the  safety and tolerability of

received two doses of 3 mg/kg and 6 patients received 10 mg/kg ipilimumab monotherapy with a 
3-week interval between doses prior to surgery of the urothelia l tumor.121Surgical delay was noted 
in 3 patients. Of note, at the approve dose of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg), none of the subjects had a 
delay in surgery due to a drug-related adverse event, and preop erative ipilimumab was safe and 
well tolerated. Two patients at the 10 mg/kg dose had delay due to irAE (Grade 2 and 3 diarrhea). 
An additional patient developed Grade 3 dia rrhea and delayed surgical planning, but surgery was 
cancelled due to disease progression. 
Based on the safety/ tolerability profile as described in Section 1.4.1.2 , it is unlikely that subjects 
in the neoadjuvant cohort receiving 2 doses of nivolumab will e xperience a significant d elay in 
surgery . In addition, as of 10 -Mar-2015, there have been approxim ately  3289 subjects treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy in BMS sponsored clinical trials. Overall , there has been an approximate 
3% frequency of any grade, drug-related serious adverse events within the first 4 weeks of 
treatment, with the most frequent being pneumonitis (0.33%), py rexia (0.3%), i nfusion-related 
reaction (0.24%), and hypersensitivity reaction (0.12%). All ot her drug-related serious adverse 
events have occurred at a frequency of < 0.1%. Given the low fre quency of SAEs and a 
manageable toxicity profile of nivolumab, BMS anticipates a fav orable benefit-risk profile with 
short term administration of nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setti ng. 
1.1.4 Rationale for Immunotherapy in Virus-Associated Tumors
As described above, the adaptive T cell response largely depend s upon presentation of antigens by 
MHC in the context of an immune-stimulatory environment. Viral proteins, mutated proteins 
(neoantigens), and spatio-temporally dysregulated self-proteins represent targets of the T cell 
response that have potential to result in tumor-cell clearance. As evidence, T cell responses to viral 
antigens in patients with EBV+ or polyomavirus+ tumors can be i dentified and T cells against 
tumor neoantigens and self-antigens have been widely reported i n the literature.122Further, overall 
survival of both gastric and Merkel cell carcinoma patien ts is prognostically associated with the 
presence of tumor infiltrating T cells, suggesting immunosurvei llance of tumor growth is taking 
place.123,124
Nonetheless, endogenous immune responses do not cause all tumors to regress. One plausible 
explanation, which has direct therapeutic consequences, is that  virus associated tumors express 
PD-1 ligands as an adaptive response to virus antigen-specific cytokine-secreting T cells in the 
tumor microenvironment. Recently published results on HPV+ SCCH N and MCC support this 
notion. A recent review of MCC specimens for PD-L1 expression b y tumor cells and tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) found that PD-L1 expression was present in 49% and 55% of samples, respectively, and specimens with PD-L1+ tumor cells, 9 7% (28/29) showed a geographic 
association with immune infiltrates.
125Among specimens with moderate-severe TIL intensities, 
100% (29/29) showed PD-L1 expression by tumor cells, but MCPyV( -) tumor cells were 
uniformly PD-L1(-).

These results demonstrated th at virtually all HPV+ SCCHN and a majority of MCV+ MCC are 
PD-L1+ and, when positive, demonstrate focal PD-L1 expression associated with areas of 
lymphocyte infiltration. Conversely, among 8 MCV- MCCs, none exp ressed PD-L1. 
Taken together, these data suggest that virus associated cancer s have distinct patterns of immune 
responses and a distinct tumor immune microenvironment.
1.1.5 Rationale and Aims for Biomarker Assessments
The biological basis of nivolumab, ipilimumab, relatlimab, and daratumumab in the treatment of 
oncological disease is to modul ate the immune system to both generate and restore a durable an ti-
tumor response leading to clearance of tumor. Clinical data sup ports the hypothesis that inhibition 
of the PD-1 pathway results in rejection of tumor by the host i mmune system.
The precise mechanisms by which nivolumab, ipilimumab, relatlimab , and daratumumab exert 
their immune-modulatory and anti-tumor activities is unclear; howev er, particular cell types, such 
as effector T cells and regulatory  T cells, are c ritical f or the anti-tumor response. 
Therefore, the major questions that will be addressed through the conduct of this study are:
•Are tumor and/or viral-specific T cells present at the tumor si te prior to nivolumab
monotherapy and in combination with ipilimumab, r elatlimab, or daratumumab therapy?
•Do nivolumab monotherapy and in combination with ipilimumab, relat limab, or daratumumab
alter the frequency and activation state of tumor and/or viral- specific tumor infiltrating T cells?
•Does expression of PD-L1 or PD-L2 on tumor cells prior to thera py correlate with clinical 
efficacy to monotherapy and combination therapies?
•Does the mutational status of tu mor cells c orrelate with clinical efficacy to monotherapy and 
combination therapies?
•Can we define distinct pharmacodynamic markers of monotherapy an d combination therapies
in the peripheral compartment?
•How do nivolumab monotherapy and combination with ipilimumab, rel atlimab, or 
daratumumab alter the activating and negative costimulatory mole cules on immune cells in the 
periphery and at the tumor site? 
•Do non-responding subjects have distinct mechanisms of resistan ce to study drugs (such as an 
increase in additional negative regulatory proteins, an increas e in MDSC or Treg, or loss of 
tumor-associated antigens in the tumor)?
•Is the intratumoral or peripheral T cell repertoire predictive of response to study drugs?
•Does the composition and phenotype of the tumor microenvironment, at baseline, or on 
treatment, correlate with clinical efficacy?
1.1.6 Rationale for Dose Selection for Nivolumab 
Nivolumab is currently approved for the treatment of various tu mors, including melanoma, 
adjuvant treatment of melano ma, NSCLC, RCC, classical Hodgkin L ymphoma, SCCHN,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and urothelial carcinoma, using a regimen of either nivolumab 240 
mg Q2W or nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W.

The nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W was selected for this study based on clinical 
data and modeling and simulation approaches using PPK and expos ure-response analyses 
examining relationships between nivolumab exposures and efficac y and safety responses, using 
data from studies in multiple tumor types with body weight- normalized dosing (mg/kg). Flat 
dosing is expected to reduce prescription dosing errors, shorte n pharmacy preparation time, and 
improve ease of administration. Additionally, in case of 480 mg  Q4W, extending the dosing 
interval to 4 weeks provided numerous benefits to participants a s they would have increased 
flexibility between clinical visits.
Using the PPK and exposure-response models, nivolumab exposures  and probabilities of efficacy 
responses and risks of AEs were predicted following nivolumab 48 0 mg Q4W administration and 
compared to those following nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W administration.  The overall distributions 
of average nivolumab steady-state exposures (C av,ss) are comparable follo wing administration with 
either nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W or nivolumab 480 mg Q4W over a wide ra nge of body weights. 
Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W administration is predicted to result in app roximately 43% greater 
steady-state peak concentrations (C max,ss) compared to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. Although the 
Cmax,ss of nivolumab is expected to be greater following nivolumab 480 m g Q4W compared to 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, the predicted C max,ss following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is well below 
the median C max,ss achieved following administration of nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W, a sa fe and 
tolerable dose level across a wide body range (35 to 160 kg).
Exposure-safety analysis demonstrated that the exposure margins  for safety are maintained 
following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W, and the predicted risks of AEs du e to discontinuation or death, 
≥Grade 3 AEs, and ≥Grade 2 immunotherapy-mediated AEs (IMAEs) are predicted to be s imilar 
following administration of nivol umab 480 mg Q4W relative to nivo lumab 3 mg/kg Q2W across 
tumor types. Safety analyses using available data following niv olumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and 
10 mg/kg Q2W administration indicated there were no differences in AE profiles across body-
weight groups. Finally, init ial clinical evidence demonstrates that, following administration o f 
nivolumab 480 mg Q4W, nivolumab is well tolerated.Nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is predicted to have approximately 16% lowe r steady-state trough 
concentrations (C
min,ss) compared to nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. While these exposures are 
predicted to be lower, they are on the flat part of the exposur e-response curves and are not predicted 
to affect efficacy. Exposure-efficacy analyses of multiple PK m easures and efficacy endpoints 
indicated that following administration of nivolumab 480 mg Q4W, efficacy is predicted to be 
similar to that following administration of nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2 W across multiple tumor types. 
Based on these data, nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is expected to have sim ilar efficacy and safety 
profiles to nivolumab 240 mgQ2W or nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W.
1.1.7 Rationale for Shorter Infusion Times for Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Long infusion times place a burden on patients and treatment cen ters. Establishing that nivolumab 
and ipilimumab can be safely administered using shorter infusion times of 30 minutes duration in 
subjects will diminish the burden provided no change in safety profile. Previous clinical studies of 
nivolumab monotherapy and ipilimumab monotherapy and the combin ation of nivolumab and

ipilimumab have used a 60 minute infusion duration for nivoluma b and 90-minute infusion 
duration for ipilimu mab (1 - 3 mg/ kg dosing for both). However, both nivolumab and ipilimumab 
have been administered at up to 10 mg/kg with the same infusion  duration.
•Nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses  ranging up to 10 mg/kg 
safely over long treatment duration. In Study CA209010, (a Phas e 2, randomized, double 
blinded, dose-ranging study of nivolumab in subjects with advanced/metastatic cl ear cell RCC) 
a dose association was observed for infusion site r eactions a nd hypersensitivity reactions (1.7% 
at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All the events were Grade 1 - 2 and 
were manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose 
provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any safety con cerns compared to the prior 
experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60-minute duration
•Similarly, ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg has been safely administered over 90 minutes. In the 
CA184022 study, where ipilimumab was administered up to a dose of 10 mg/kg, on-study drug 
related hypersensitivity events (Grade 1 - 2) were reported in 1  (1.4%) subject in the 0.3 mg/kg 
and in 2 (2.8%) s ubjects in the 10 mg/ kg group. There were no d rug-related hypersensitivity 
events reported in the 3 mg/kg group. Across the 3 treatment gr oups, no Grade 3 - 4 drug-
related hypersensitivity events were reported and there were no  reports of infusion r eactions. 
Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy has also been safely administer ed as 90 minute infusion in 
large phase 3 studies in prostate cancer (CA184043) and as adju vant therapy for stage 3 
melanoma (CA184029), with infusion reactions occurring in subjects. Administering 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab represents one-tenth of the 10 mg/kg dose.
Overall, infusion reactions including high-grade hypersensitivi ty reactions have been uncommon 
across nivolumab or ipilimumab clinical studies or the combinat ion of nivolumab a nd ipilimumab. 
Furthermore, a 30-minute break after the first infusion for the  metastatic combination cohort will 
ensure the appropriate safety monitoring before the start of th e second infusion. Overall, a change 
in safety profile is not anticip ated with 30-minute infusion of  nivolumab, ipilimumab, or 
combination.
1.1.8 Rationale for Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab Combination Therapy
Ipilimumab is a monoclonal IgG1κ that binds to the CTLA-4 antig en expressed on a subset of 
T cells from human  and nonhuman pr imates. The proposed mechanism of action for ipilimumab

blockade of the inhibitory modulation of T-cell activation prom oted by the CTLA 4/B7 interacti on. 
Ipilimumab has been approved for use in over 40 countries including the United States in March 
2011 and the European Union in July 2011. The safety profile is  detailed in the Investigator 
Brochure.

Immune checkpoint blockade is a rapidly advancing therapeutic a pproach in the field of immuno-
oncology and treatment with investigational agents targ eting this mechanism has induced 
regressions in several types of cancer. Programmed death 1 (PD- 1) receptor and cytotoxic T-

complementary roles in regulating adaptive immunity. Whereas PD-1 contributes to T-cell 
exhaustion in peripheral tissues, CTLA-4 inhibits at earlier po ints in T-cell activation. 
Preclinical data indicate that the combination of PD-1 and CTLA -4 receptor blockade may 
improve activity. In vit ro combinations of nivoluma b plus ipilimumab increase IFN- γproduction 
2- to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reacti on. Increased antitumor activity 
of the combination was also observed in 3 of 5 syngeneic murine  cancer models. In a murine 
melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA-4 or PD-1 ant ibodies increased the 
proporti on of CTLA-4 and PD-1-expressing CD4/CD8 tumor infiltra ting T effector cells, and dual 
blockade increased tumor inf iltration of T effector cells and d ecreased intratumoral T regul atory 
cells, as compared to either agent alone.14,127
Multiple studies suggest a higher response rate and antitumor a ctivity with the combination of 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab. The combination of nivolumab and ipi limumab was evaluated in 
CA209004 (MDX1106-04), a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study  in subjects with 
treatment-naive and previously treated advanced melanoma. Results showed promising activity 
with higher, but tolerable to xicity than ip ilimumab alone.128Based on these data, CA209069, a 
phase 2 study, compared the combination to ipilimumab alone in treatment-naïve patients with 
advanced melanoma: nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every  3 weeks x4 followed by 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks versus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every  3 weeks x 4.129In patients 
with BRAF wild type tumors, the ORR was 61% (44/72), including 22% (16/72) complete 
responses (CR) in the group treated with the combination, compa red to 11% (4/37) with 0 CRs in 
those treated with ipilimumab alone. The median PFS was not rea ched in the combination versus 
4.4 months for ipilimumab alone (HR=0.4). Recently, a phase 3 s tudy (CA209067, n= 945) 
reported significantly improved PFS and ORR with the combinatio n of nivolumab a nd ipilimumab 
versus ipilimumab alone in previously untreated melanoma. The m edian progression-free survival 
was 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3 to 9.5) in the nivo lumab group, 11.5 months 
(95% CI, 8.9 to 16.7) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group, and 2.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 
3.4) in the ipilimuma b group. Si gnificantly longer progression- free survival was observed in the 
nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group than in the ipilimumab group (ha zard ratio for death or disease 
progression, 0.42; 99.5% CI, 0.31 to 0.57; P<0.001) and in the nivolumab group than in the 
ipilimumab group (hazard ratio, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.43 to 0.76; P <0.001). The hazard ratio for the 
comparison between the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and the nivolumab group was 0.74 
(95% CI, 0.60 to 0.92). Deep and durable responses were observed  in previously treated, extensive 
stage SCLC, with a response rate of 31.1% with the combination of nivolumab a nd ipilimumab.130
Given the increased efficacy observed with combination approach es in other tumor types, 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab may offer subjects with metastatic or  recurrent cancers, who have been 
previously treated w ith up to 2 prior therapies and have no other  approved treatment options, the 
potential for benefit.

1.1.9 Rationale to Support Dose/Schedule of Nivolumab Combined with 
Ipilimumab
Rationale for Combo A: nivolumab 3 mg/kg q 2weeks + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q 6weeks
The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab was evaluated in CA 209004 (MDX1106-04), a 
Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study in sub jects with treatment-naive and previously treated 
advanced melanoma. Antitumor activity was observed in 5 differe nt combination cohorts: 
•nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (Cohort 1, n = 14)
•nivolumab 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (Cohort 2, n = 17)
•nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Cohort 2a, n = 16)
•nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (Cohort 3, n = 6)
•nivolumab 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg (Cohort 8, n = 41)
From this study, it has been found that the 3 mg/kg nivolumab an d 3 mg/kg ipilimumab 
combination regimen exceeded the maximum tolerated dose. Even t hough the drug-related 
discontinuation rates in combination cohorts were approximately  26 - 27%, the ORR in these 
cohorts were still higher compared to nivolumab monotherapy (42 % - 44% versus 36%).
Additional studies have demonstrated the potential for IO combi nations to improve antitumor 
responses across the nivolumab program.131An ORR of 62 - 65% has been observed in advanced 
melanoma (CA209067 and CA209069, N = 407) with a combination regimen of nivolumab 
1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg ev ery 3 weeks for 4 doses. In RCC pa tients (CA209016), both 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 21) and nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 
3 mg/kg (n = 23) showed antitumor activity with an ORR of 38% - 40%. 
Activity was observed in all cohorts, with response rates great er than 30% in the 2 cohorts in which 
nivolumab was dosed as 3 mg/kg. Follow-up time is limited, but PFS and OS was also encouraging 
in the nivolumab 3 mg/kg cohorts.
In summary, nivolumab and ipilimumab combinations have shown ad ditive or synergistic 
activities across the tumor types investigated. To further impr ove the tolerability profile, other 
combination dosing regimens were also explored in the nivolumab  development program. Less 
frequent dosing of ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg q6week when given with  nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2week 
was found to have a similar discontinuation rate to that observ ed in nivolumab monotherapy (11% 
vs 10%) in preliminary data from CA209012.
Rationale for Combo B: nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, q3 weeks x4, followed by 
nivolumab 240 mg q2 weeks
In CA209004, the 3 mg/kg nivolu mab and 3 mg/kg ipilimumab cohort  exceeded the maximum 
tolerated dose per protocol. In CA209004, while both Cohort 2 ( 1 mg/kg nivolumab + 3 mg/kg 
ipilimumab) and Cohort 2a (3 mg/kg nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimum ab) had similar clinical 
activity, a dose of 3 mg/kg of i pilimumab every 3 weeks for a t otal of four doses and 1 mg/kg 
nivolumab every 3 weeks for four doses followed by nivolumab 3 m g/kg every 2 weeks until 
progression was chosen. Exposure-response analysis of nivolumab  monotherapy across dose

ranges of 1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg reveals s imilar clinical activity while exposure-response analysis 
of 0.3 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg of ipilimumab monotherapy h ave demonstrated increasing 
activity with increase in dose in the phase 2 study CA184022. T herefore, theoretically the selection 
of 3 mg/ kg of ipilimuma b (Cohort 2) may be more clinically impactful th an selection of  3 mg/kg 
of nivolumab (Cohort 2a). The combination arm has a similar dos e and schedule as that in 
CA209004 for the first 12 weeks, increasing the likelihood of r eplicating the clinical activity seen 
in the CA209004 study. Based on the clinical activity in CA2090 04, the majority of responses to 
the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab occur in the first 12 weeks. Given the uncertainty 
of whether the ipilimumab administered past week 12 contributes  to the clinical benefit and the 
fact that the approved schedule for ipilimumab is every 3 weeks  for a total of four doses in the 
FDA and EMA approved label dosing section, ipilimumab will admi nistered every 3 weeks for a 
total of 4 doses. Nivolumab monothe rapy treatment every two weeks until progression was studied 
in CA209003 and has been studied across the nivolumab monothera py Phase 3 registrational trials. 
Thus starting at week 12, which is after the completion of the four doses of com bined nivolumab 
and ipilimumab, nivolumab would continue to be administered every two weeks until progression.
Based on these data, the followi ng two dosing schema will be ev aluated in the metastatic 
combination treatment arms for CA209358:
•Combo A: nivolumab 3 mg/kg q 2weeks + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q 6wee ks
•Combo B: nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, q3 weeks x4, f ollowed by nivolumab 
240 mg q2 weeks
In view of the safety and efficacy data seen with Combo A in pa tients with NSCLC, Combo A 
will be investigated in the EBV positive NPC, cervical, vaginal,  vulvar, anal canal and penile
cancer, HPV positive SCCHN and polyomavirus positive MCC tumor types.  
In addition, Combo B w ill be invest igated in p atients with cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal canal,
and penile cancer tumor types in order to understand the effects of the higher dose of ipilimumab 
in viral positive tumor types. In addition, give n the limited in formation on the optimal 
dose/regimen for these cancers, two doses are being proposed.
1.1.10 Rationale for Nivolumab plus Anti-LAG-3 Antibody (relatlimab, BMS-
986016) Combination Therapy
Like PD-1, lymphocyte activatio n gene-3 (LAG-3 ; CD223) is also a type I transmembrane protein 
that is expressed on the cell surface of activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and subsets of NK and 
dendritic cells.132,133LAG-3 is closely related to CD4, which is a co-receptor for T h elper cell 
activatio n. Both molecules have 4 extracellular Ig-like domains  and require binding to their ligand, 
major histocompatib ility complex (MHC) class II, for their functional activity. In  contrast to CD4, 
LAG-3 is only expressed on the cell s urface of activated T  cells and its cleavage from the cell 
surface terminates LAG-3 signaling. LAG-3 can also be found as a soluble protein but it does not 
bind to MHC class II and its function is unknown.

It has been reported that LAG-3 plays an important role in prom oting regulatory T cell (Treg) 
activity and in negatively regulati ng T cell activatio n and proliferation.134Both natural and induced 
Treg express increased LAG-3, which is required for their maxim al suppressive function.135,136
Furthermore, ectopic expression of LAG-3 on CD4 + effector T cells redu ced their proliferative 
capacity and conferred on them regulatory potent ial against third party T c ells.136Recent studies 
have also shown that high LAG- 3 expression on exhausted lymphoc ytic c horiomeni ngitis virus 
(LCMV)-specific CD8 + T cells contributes to their unresponsive state and limits CD8 + T cell 
antitumor responses.120,137In fact, LAG-3 maintained tolerance to self and tumor antigens via 
direct effects on CD8 + T cells in 2 murine models.
Immune tolerance observed i n the setting of tumor development a nd tumor recurrence, however, 
seems to be mediated by the co-expression of various T cell negative regulatory receptors, not 
solely from LAG- 3. Data from chronic viral infection mod els,120,136, 138knock-out mice,139,140, 141
tumor recurrence models,142and, to a more limited extent, h uman cancer patient s,142,143,144support 
a model wherein T cells that are continuously exposed to antige n become progressively inactivated 
through a process termed “exhaustion.” Exhausted T cells are char acterized by the expression of 
T cell negative regulatory r eceptors, predominantly CTLA-4, PD-1, and LAG-3, whose action i s 
to limit the cell’s ability t o proliferate, produce cytokines, and kill target cells and/ or to increase 
Treg activity. However, the timi ng and sequence of expression o f these molecules in the 
development and recurrence of tumors have not been fully charac terized.
It is hypothesized that CTLA-4 acts as the dominant off-switch for tolerance, but it is the strong 
synergy between the  PD-1 and LAG-3 in hibitory pathways that seems to mediate tolerance to both 
self and tumor antig ens.139,140,142Whereas CTLA-4 knockout (KO) mice die pr ematurely from 
multiorgan inflammation,145PD-1 and LAG-3 single knockout mice presen t minimal 
immunopathologic sequelae .140In contrast, dual knock-out mice (LAG3-/-PD1-/- ) abrogates self-
tolerance with resultant autoimmune  infiltrates in multiple organs and even lethal ity.139,140These 
dual knock-out mice also show ma rkedly increased survival from and cleara nce of multiple 
transplantable tumo rs.139
Conversely, extensi ve co-expression of PD-1 and LAG-3 on tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells has been shown in distinct transplant able tumors and samples from melanoma, RCC, head 
and neck, NSCLC and ovarian cancer patie nts.142,146,147,148,149,150,151Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 
interactions has been successfully used to re store a ntitumor immunity in preclinical and clinical 
studies. But the simultaneous blockade of PD-1 and LAG-3 pathwa ys on T cells may exert an even 
more robust antitumoral immunity in naive as well as in recurre nt tumors due to the possibility of 
reversing LAG-3–mediated T cell exhaustion. In 2 syngeneic mice  models, for example, dual anti–
LAG-3/anti–PD-1 antibody t herapy is able to cure mo st mice of established tumors that are largely 
resistant to single antibody t reatment.139Furthermore, recurrent tumors from a melanoma mouse 
model with increased Treg c ell numbers and increase d expression of checkpoint inhibitors PD-1, 
LAG-3, TIGIT, and TIM-3,  can be controlled by de pletion of Tregs (via FoxP3-DTR) plus the 
administration of anti–PD-L 1 antibody. But more imp ortantly, tumor regression of these recurrent

tumors can also be accomplished with the combination of anti-PD- L1 plus anti-LAG-3 antibodies 
(C9B7W mAb) which also increases T cell activity.142
Given the literature supporting synergistic activity o f nivolumab a nd anti–LAG-3 anti body i n viral 
models, it is hypothesized that this combination could have ant itumor effects in virally-related 
cancers, including human papilloma virus (HPV)-related tumors s uch as HPV+ head and neck 
cancer (HNC). Recent evidence has shown a role of immune inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1/PD-
L1) in the adaptive immune resistance seen in HNCs associated w ith HPV. In these cancers with 
high lymphocytic infiltration, there is PD-1 expression on the majority of CD8+ tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) and PD-L1 expression on both tumor cells and  tumor-associated 
macrophages.138In a recent analysis, 33% to 47% of head and neck tumors showed  a T cell-
inflamed phenotype (TCIP) similar to melanoma, based on a gene expression signature. 
Interestingly, 75% of HPV (+) tumors showed a TCIP compared to 23% of HPV(-) tumors. 
Furthermore, various checkpoint molecules were universally co-e xpressed in these TCIP tumors 
including PD1, CTLA4, LAG3, PDL-2, and IDO, as shown in gene ex pression analysis.147
Altogether these data support a role for the PD-1:PD-L1 pathway  in T cell exhaustion leading to 
both persistence of HPV infection and malignant progression in HNC patients. It is then possible 
that LAG-3 may also play a role in virally induced T cell exhaustion in these patients. Gastric 
cancer is another exploratory tumor suitable for T cell-dir ected therapy bas ed on preliminary 
objective responses observed in patients treated with anti-PD-L 1 antibody therapy.152In addition, 
LAG-3 expression ≥ 1% by immunohist ochemistry has been document ed in ~35% of gastric 
cancer samples ( BMS-986016 Investig ator Brochure v03. Document Control No. 930071620). A 
subtype of gastric cancer is also associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.148This 
subtype is characterized by massive lymphocyte infiltration, better prognosis than EBV-negative tumors, and worldwide distribution, particularly in Asia. So, s imilar to HNC, the expression of 
checkpoint inhibitors may be leading to the persistence of EBV i nfection and/or malignant 
progression of these tumors which could be halted by T cell-dir ected therapy.
These data argue strongly that dual blockade of the PD-1 and LA G-3 pathways could be a 
promising combinatorial strateg y for viral positive tumors.
Relatlimab is a  fully human anti body sp ecific for human LAG-3 that was isolate d from imm unized 
transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes. It is ex pressed as an IgG4 isotype 
antibody that includes a stab ilizing hinge m utation (S228P) for  attenuated Fc receptor binding in 
order to reduce or eliminate the possibility of antibody- or com plement-mediated target cell killing. 
Relatlimab binds to a defined epitope on LAG-3 with high affinit y (Kd, 0.25-0.5 nM) and 
specificity and potently blocks the interaction of LAG-3 with it s ligand, MHC class II (IC50, 0.7 
nM). The antibody exhibits potent in vitro functional activity in reversing LAG-3-mediated 
inhibition of an antigen-specific murine T cell hybridoma overe xpressing human LAG-3 (IC50, 1 
nM). In addition, Relat limab enhances activation of human T cell s in superantigen stimulation 
assays when added alone or in combination with nivolumab (anti- PD-1 antibody).

1.1.11 Rationale to Support Dose/Schedule of Nivolumab Combined with 
Relatlimab
Based on the available nonclinical combinatio n data and the pre liminary clinical data from st udy 
CA224-020, a combined dosing regimen of nivolumab 240 mg Q2W an d BMS-986016 80 mg 
Q2W (Combo C) is selected for the metastatic cohort nivolumab p lus BMS-986016 combination.
Overall, the safety profile of B MS-986016 in combination with n ivolumab is manageable, with no 
MDT reached at the tested doses up to 80 mg BMS-986016 and 240 mg nivolumab (flat dose, 
2qw), and with evaluation of 240 mg BMS- 986016 and 240 mg nivolumab combination dose based 
on clinical cut-off  of 29-Jun-2016.153Important examples of durable tumor regressions, as well as 
manageable immune-mediated adverse events provide evidence of i mmune activation in the 
subjects treated up to 80 mg BMS-986016/240 mg nivolumab. The c linical findings are supported 
by the preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) and receptor occupancy (RO) findings. Peripheral CD8+ 
T-cell RO data measured at tr ough monotherapy BMS-986016 treatment shows a linear increase 
with dose: 74% RO at 20 mg, 84% RO at 80 mg, and 94% RO at 240 m g. A preliminary PK 
analysis indicates that BMS-986016 exposure parameters are gene rally proportional across the 
dose range evaluated (20 to 800 mg) and were not altered by com bination with nivolumab.
Taken together, the preliminary data suggest t hat 80 mg BMS-986 016 in combination with 240 mg 
nivolumab is safe and well tolerated, and there will be no drug -drug interaction expected from this 
combination. Therefore, a combined dosing regimen of nivolumab 2 40 mg Q2W and BMS- 986016 
80 mg Q2W is recommended for investigation in this study.

Relatlimab Adverse Event Management Guidelines
In order to standardize the management of IO AEs across all nove l IO treatment combinations and 
given that nivolumab is the backbone of therapy, nivolumab AE a lgorithms are recommended for 
AE management (see Appendix 2  for Nivolumab Adverse Event Management Guidelines for 
details).
1.1.12 Rationale for Nivolumab plus Daratumumab Combination Therapy
The tumor microenvironment is believed to be important in deter mining whether a patient can 
make an effective immune respons e to his/her tumor. Tumor cells can i nduce an 
immunosuppressive microenvironment through multiple tolerogenic factors and expression of 
inhibitory surface receptors t hat create a sh ield a round the tu mor, resulting in evasion of the 
immune response. Two such mechanisms include (1) expression of PD-L1 in tumor or infiltrating 
cells, which triggers PD-1 on T cells, inhibiting T cell activa tion and expansion of previously 
activated T cells; and (2) recruitment of immunosuppressive cel l types such as regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into the t umor. Individual tumors may use 
more than one means to evade t he immune system. Therefore using  more than one method to 
unleash the immune response may show synergistic effects.

Nivolumab, which blocks the PD-1 pathway, has demonstrated sing le agent clin ical eff icacy 
resulting in a survival benefit in patients with metastatic mel anoma, squamous and non-squamous 
NSCLC, advanced RCC and has an approved label in these indicati ons. Nivolumab has also 
demonstrated signif icant response rates i n other solid tumor malignan cies including small-cell lung 
cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer. The combination o f nivolumab with other therapies, 
such as ipilimumab, has also demonstrated meaningful response r ates and progression-free 
survival in multiple solid tumor indications and is approved for metastatic melanoma in the US.  
Daratumumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal anti body that targets CD38, 
inducing tumor cell d eath through multiple mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity , and antibody dependent 
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP).155,156Daratumumab has shown promising anti-myeloma activity 
in 2 clinical studies (GEN501 and SIRIUS) in patients with rela psed and refractory MM, resulting 
in remarkable response rates that include stringent complete re sponses (sCRs) and prolonged 
clinical responses i n heavily pretreated patients.157,158Based on these data, daratumumab was 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients wi th MM who have received ≥ 3
prior lines of therapy.159The target of daratumumab is CD38, which is highly and uniforml y 
expressed on all malignant MM cells  and expressed at relatively low levels on lymphoid or 
myeloid cells and in some tissues of non-hematopoietic origin.160CD38 is a type II transmembrane 
glycoprotein with ectoen zymatic activity involved in the catabolis m of extracellular nucleotides.
160,161Other functions ascribed to CD38 include r eceptor-mediated adhesion b y interacting with 
CD31 or hyaluronic acid, regulation of migration, and signaling  events160,161, 162Daratumumab 
induces killing of MM cells and other CD38+ e xpressing cell typ es via the activation of potent 
cytotoxic immune effector functions, including antibody-dependen t cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), 
antibody- dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependen t cytotoxicity 
(CDC)155,163Another mechanism of action is induction of apoptosis upon seco ndary 
crosslinking.164In addition, during daratu mumab therapy, an increase in CD4+ T cells and CD8+ 
T cells has been demonstr ated. These T cells are possibly involved in a host-anti-MM imm une 
response. This increase can be related to cross presentation of  tumor antigens by antigen-
presenting cells after phagocytosis of daratumumab-coated MM ce lls in combination with killing 
of CD38-positive suppressor cells such Tregs, Bregs, and myeloid-derived s uppressor cells 
(MDSCs)165
In the current study, the combination of daratumumab to nivolumab is expected to deplete CD38+ 
immunosuppressive cells from the tumor microenvironment, thus a lleviating the 
immunosuppression so that the nivolumab activated T cells can mo unt an effective immune 
response to the tumor. This trial will test whether simultaneou s blockade of PD-1 with nivolumab 
and the immunoregulatory effects with daratumumab will result i n enhanced anti-tumor responses 
in patients with solid tumors.
Following a full review of all available relevant data for daratumumab in combination with 
nivolumab, a safety signal that would cause a significant risk for patients was not validated based

on the absence of a pattern of severe AEs that could not be accounted for by underlying disease or 
prior therapy.
The cumulative efficacy data in more than 100 patients in differ ent solid tumor cohorts does not 
demonstrate an eff icacy signal that would warrant continuation of the combination  treatment in 
these solid tumor trials. Ther efore, additional enrollment and c ontinued treatment in this cohort 
have been discontinued. At the discretion of the principal invest igator, alternative treatment 
options will be considered and/or subject(s) may continue treat ment with nivolumab monotherapy.
1.1.13 Rationale for Nivolumab Combined with Daratumumab in Patients with 
HPV Positive and Negative or Unknown SCCHN
Per Revised Protocol 06, enrollment and treatment in this cohort  have been terminated. This study 
will investigate the combination of daratumumab and nivolumab i n patients with HPV positive,
negative, or unknown SCCHN. Nivolumab, which blocks the PD-1 pat hway, has demonstrated 
single agent clinical efficacy in numerous tumor types. However, there are still a signif icant 
number of patients that do not respond to single-agent checkpoint inhibition possibly due to other 
immunosuppressive mechanisms present in the tumor microenvironm ent. This presence of 
immunosuppressive cell types such as Tregs and MDSCs in the tum or microenvironment actively 
dampen the anti-tumor response.  
Daratumumab a human immunoglobu lin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibod y that targets CD38 has 
shown promising anti-myeloma activity in 2 clinical studies (GE N501 and SIRIUS) in patients 
with relapsed and refractory MM. Responding patients also demon strated increased T-cell 
responses to viral- a nd alloantigens, suggesting a revival of anti-tumor immune response from an 
immune suppressive state.165The fact that CD38 is expressed on Treg and suppressive cells o f 
myeloid lineage, plus the observed immune stimulatory activity of daratumumab in the clinic, 
suggest that daratumumab may exhibit immune-stimulatory activit ies by targeting CD38+ Treg. 
Data mini ng of TCGA data indicates that CD38 mRNA expression is  present in tumor biopsies 
from SCCHN subjects and these biopsies have also shown to have a ll Treg gene based signature. 
This supports th e hypothesis of targeting CD38+ Treg populations in SCCHN to reverse 
immunosuppression and up regulate anti-tumor immunity. Such immu nity will be  further 
enhanced through the combination treatment with nivolumab, by c o-targeting CD38+ Treg and 
P D - 1  i m m u n e  c h e c k p o i n t .  T h i s  i m m u n o - m o d u l a t o r y  r o l e  o f  d a r a t u m u mab for reversing the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment has prompted a clinical evaluation of the 
combination of daratumumab with the immune checkpoint inhibitor , nivolumab in patient with 
HPV positive, negative or unknown SCCHN.1.1.14 Rationale to Support Dose/Schedule of Nivolumab Combined with 
Daratumumab
Per Revised Protocol 06, enrollment and treatment in this cohort  have been terminated. For the 
nivolumab/daratumumab combina tion cohort, nivolumab will be administered at 240 mg Q2W, an 
approved nivolumab dosing regimen for NSCLC and RCC indications . Daratumumab will be 
administered at 16 mg/kg QW from Week 1 to 8, Q2W from Week 9 t o 24, and Q4W from Week 
25 and for a maximum of 24 months, or until disease progression, unacceptable tox icity, or

withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first. As nivolumab 480 mg Q4W dosing regimen would 
produce s imilar exposures to that of 240 mg Q2W dosing regimen based on PPK modeling and 
simulation, nivolumab will be administered at 480 mg Q4W starti ng from Week 25 for the 
convenience to patients.
Dosing of daratumumab in subjects with multiple myeloma is reco mmended at 16 mg/kg (weekly 
for 8 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, then every 4 week s thereafter) administered via IV 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose se lection was based on an acceptable 
safety profile, maximal clinical activity, and pharmacokinetics  consistent with saturation of the 
target. The data supporting the selection of a 16 mg/kg dose fo r the treatment of multiple myeloma 
are as follows:
• Safety: Clinical safety data demonstrated that daratumumab is well-tolerated, with 
clinically manageable side effects, highlighted by the fact tha t no subject treated with 
16 mg/kg daratumumab monotherapy discontinued treatment as a re sult of a 
daratumumab related adverse event.
−For doses above 4 mg/kg, there was no dose dependent toxicity p attern observed.
• Clinical efficacy: Clinical response data derived from Study GEN501 and Study 
MMY2002 show robus t activity amon g subjects tr eated at 16 mg/kg with ORRs of 
36% and 29%, respectively.
−The response rates were consistently and significantly higher and deeper at the 16 mg/kg dose level as compared to various sch edules at the 8 mg/kg dose leve l.
• Pharmacokinetics: Daratumumab exhibits target-mediated drug dis position. 
Daratumumab binds to CD38 receptors in the body and the complex  w i t h  
daratumumab is rapidly cleared. As the dose is increased or aft er repeated 
administration, CD38 becomes saturated, and the impact of targe t binding clearance is 
minimized and PK data can indicate target saturation.
−Population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses sugge sted that 16 mg/kg is the 
lowest tested dose at which the majority (approximately 80%) of  subjects achieved serum 
concentrations above the model-predicted 99% target saturation threshold and 90% of the 
maximum effect on ORR threshold.
−Lowering the dose would likely result in reduced efficacy, wher eas increasing the dose may 
not provide further improvement of the benefit-risk profile.
−The initial weekly dosing schedule rapidly established efficacious concentrations. The every 2 week and every 4 week dosing frequencies were sufficient to pro duce serum concentration 
levels that maintained target saturation; thus reducing the ris k of disease progression.
Daratumumab is associated wit h high infusion- related reactions requiring treatment with steroid. 
In GEN501 study, a phase 1/2 study of daratumumab in relapsed/r efractory MM subjects, i nfusion-
related reactions were the most frequent adverse events, occurred in 71% of patients. The majority 
of these reactions included grade 1 and 2, and characterized by  rhinitis, cough, headache, pyrexia, 
and dyspnea. Most infusion- related reactions occurred during th e first daratumumab infusion and 
only few patients (<10%) had infusion-related reactions with mo re than one infusion. The SIRIUS 
(MMY2002) study confirmed the results from GEN501 study that de monstrated single agent

activity of daratumumab with a favorable toxicity profile.157,158Among one hundred six patients 
who had a median of 5 prior lines of therapy (95% refractory to  lenalidomide and bortezomib) and 
received daratumumab monotherapy at a dose of 16 mg/kg, 43% of the patients experience 
infusion-related reactions, which were predominantly grade 1 an d 2, and could be managed with 
interruption of the i nfusion or extra corticosteroids a nd antihistamines. Therefore, to mitigate the 
increased risk of infusion-related reactions for nivolumab/dara tumumab combination cohort, 
nivolumab 240 mg Q2W administration will start with the third daratumumab infusion and 
corticosteroids will be administered before and after treatment . 
Historically, clinical trials wit h nivoluma b have prohibited the use of high dose steroids before and 
during the study due to the potential interference with the imm une activation mechanism of 
checkpoint inhibition. Specifically, in the nivolumab registrat ional trials, patients requiring 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids (greater than 10 mg dai ly prednisone equivalents) within 
14 days of study drug administration were excluded. However, there have been exceptions to 
eligibility criteria for certain subjects which have not appear ed to impact the efficacy of the therapy 
including prophylactic high dose steroids for contrast dye alle rgy and non-autoimmune conditions 
such as delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Furthermore, hi gh dose systemic corticosteroids 
and other immunosuppressants are commonly used to treat immune- related adverse reactions. This 
concomitant steroid use to manage immune related AEs does not a ppear to impair the efficacy of 
nivolumab and these conclusions have been shared with the regulatory authorities. Pre-treatment 
with steroids has also been allowed in nivolumab trials where c orticosteroids are part of standard 
of care. High doses of dexamethasone have been administered wit h nivolumab therapy for patients 
with hematological malignancies where both lenalidomide and bor tezomib require administration 
with standard doses of dexamethasone. In 1L NSCLC studies with nivolumab and pembrolizumab, 
steroid pre-medication is mandated with some chemotherapies and this has not appeared to impact overall response rates (reference KN-021 study, CM 012 CSR). In  GBM studies, corticosteroid 
treatment for symptomatic brain lesions is considered standard of care and therefore allowed in 
these trials. Furthermore, the inclusion of steroid treatment i n the clinical trials with daratumumab 
did not impact the pharmacodynamic effect of expansion of activ ated T cells that was observed, 
suggesting that T cell activation and expansion s till occurs in the presence of s ystemic steroid 
treatment. Taken together, the low likelihood that steroid preme dication would compromised 
safety with, and the evidence that efficacy is not impacted by steroid premedication, support 
evaluation of nivolumab in combination with daratumumab given wi th appropriate steroid 
premedication.
Based on the well-established safety profiles of daratumumab and  nivolumab, it is not anticipated 
that the combination treatmen t will result in overlapping toxic ities. The clinical experience of the 
combination treatment is being investigated in patients enrolled  in the CA209-039 study (Multiple 
Phase 1 Safet y Cohorts of Nivolumab M onotherapy or Nivolumab Combination Regimens Across 
Relapsed/Refractory H ematologic Malignancie s), that were treate d with nivolumab and 
daratumumab at the doses that will be administered in this study . As of the database lock of 15-
May-2017, 7 patients have been dosed in CA209039: 3 in the nivo lumab and daratumumab (ND)
arm and 4 in the nivolumab and daratumumab with pomalidomide (ND -Pd) arm. The first study

drug dose was given on 30 Dec 2016; 2 subjects received 4 cycle s of therapy, 1 sub ject received 
3 cycles of therapy, 2 subjects received 2 cycles of therapy, an d 2 subjects received 1 cycle of 
therapy. One patient was discontinued from the study due to disease progression, after completing 
3 cycles of therapy. 
Related cytopenias were reported in the ND-Pd arm, which aligns with the exp ected safety profiles 
of daratumumab and pomalidomide and the underlying disease. The  daratumumab and 
pomalidomide dosing was held for the Grade 3-4 neutropenia even ts, and treatment was resumed 
upon recovery to the protocol defined blood counts.  There were 2 daratumumab related infusion related r eactions, one in each tr eatment arm, which 
resolved and the full dose was administered in both cases (afte r the infusion was inte rrupted and 
appropriate medication was administered). 
Three related SAEs were reported. A Grade 4 blood bilirubin increase in the ND arm was 
reconsidered by the investigator as an unrelated event, indicat ive of disease progression. This SAE 
was revised after the database lock. The Grade 1 pneumonitis SAE  in the ND arm was related to 
nivolumab, and resolved in 8 days after treatment was held, per  the nivolumab management 
algorithm. The Grade 3 respiratory syncyt ial virus bronchitis in the ND-Pd arm was r elated to 
daratumumab and pomalidomide, and at the time of onset (C1D8) t he patient had not started 
nivolumab dosing yet.
All safety data from the daratumumab/nivolumab c ohort in the current study w ill be regularly 
monitored by the study physician, t he protocol s tudy team, a nd the BMS medical safety teams.
Starting from Week 25, subjects in the present study will be switched from nivolum ab 240 mg 
Q2W to nivolumab 480 mg Q4W, which provides a more convenient do sing regimen for subjects. 
Based on PK modeling and simulations, nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is p redicted to provide Cavgss 
similar to 240 mg Q2W. While 480 mg Q4W is predicted to provide greater (approximately 20%) 
maximum steady state concentr ations and lower (approximately 10%) steady s tate t rough 
concentrations, these exposures are predicted to be within the exposure ranges observed at doses 
up to 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the nivolumab clinical program, and are not considered to put subjects 
at increased risk. Similar to the nivolumab 240 mg Q2W dosing r egimen, the exposures predicted 
following administration of nivo lumab 480 mg Q4W, are on the fl at part of the exposure-response 
curves for previously investigated tumors in melanoma and NSCLC , and are not predicted to affect 
efficacy. Based on these data, nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is expected  to have similar efficacy and 
safety profiles to nivolumab 240 mg Q2W. 
1.1.15 Duration of Treatment with Nivolumab Monotherapy or Combination 
Therapy
The optimal duration of immunotherapy is an important question and continues to be investigated. 
Clinical trials across different tumors types in the nivolumab and ipilimumab development 
program indicate that most of the responses occur early, with a  median time to response of 2-4 
months, and emerging data suggests that benefit can be maintain ed in the absence of continued 
treatment. A recent analysis in a melanoma study s uggests the majority of patients who discontinue

nivolumab and/or ipilimumab for toxicity maintain disease contr ol in the absence of further 
treatment.166Furthermore, a limited duration of ipilimumab, including only 4  induction doses, 
resulted in long term survival in patients with metastatic mela noma, with a su stained p lateau in 
survival starting around 2 years after the start of treatment.167
Accumulating data suggest that 2 years of PD-1 checkpoint inhib itor treatment may be sufficient 
for long term benefit. CA209003, a dose-escalation cohort expan sion trial evaluating the safety 
and clinical activity of n ivolumab in patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors 
(including 129 subjects with NSCLC), specified a maximum treatm ent duration of 2 y ears. Among 
16 subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who discont inued nivolumab after 
completing 2 years of treatment, 12 subjects were alive >5 year s and remained progression-free 
without any subsequent therapy (2) In the CA209003 NSCLC cohort , the overall survival (OS) 
curve begins to plateau after 2 y ears, with an OS rate of 25% a t 2 years and 18% at 3 years.168
These survival outcomes are similar to phase 3 studies in previ ously treated NSCLC, in which 
nivolumab treatment was continued until progression or unaccept able toxicity (2 year OS rates of 
23% and 29%, and 3 year OS rates of 16%-18% for squamous and no n-squamous NSCLC 
respectively).169
Similar results have been re ported in clinical studies of pembrolizumab, another PD-1 inhib itor. 
Keynote-010 was a randomized phase 3 trial of pembrolizumab (at  either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks) versus docetaxel in subjects with previously tre ated, PD-L1-positive, advanced 
NSCLC which specified a  maximum treatment duration of 2 years for pembrolizumab. OS was 
significantly longer with both pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (HR 0.72, p = 0.00017) and pembrolizumab 
10 mg/kg (HR 0.60, p < 0.00001) compared t o docetaxel, with an O S plateau developing beyond 
2 years in both pembrolizumab arms. Among 690 patients who rece ived pembrolizumab, 47 
patients completed 2 y ears of pembrolizumab and stopped treatme nt. Most were able to maintain 
their response, including those with stable disease, with only 2 patients (4%) having confirmed 
progression after stopping at 2 years.170
Keynote-006 was a randomized phase 3 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients 
with advanced melanoma, which also specified a maximum 2 year duration of pembrolizumab 
treatment. 104 (19%) of 556 patients rando mized to pembrolizumab completed  2  y e a r s  o f  
treatment. With a median follow-up of 9 months after completion of pembrol izumab, the estimated 
risk of progression or death was 9% in these patients.171
Taken together, these data suggest that treatment beyond 2 year s is unlikely to confer additional

In contrast, a shorter duration of nivolumab of only 1 year was  associated with increased risk of 
progression in previously tr eated patients with NSCLC, s uggesting that treatment be yond 1 year 
is likely needed. In CA209153, patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC who completed

progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those who were rand omized to st op treatment, with 
median PFS (post-ra ndomization) not reached  vs 10.3 months, respectively; HR=0.42 (95% CI, 
0.25 to 0.71). With a median follow-up of 14.9 months post-rand omization, there also was a trend 
for patients on continued treatment to live longer (OS HR = 0.63 [95% CI: 0.33, 1.20]). Of note,  
the PFS curves in both groups plateau approximately 1 year afte r rando mization (i. e., 2 years after 
treatment initiation), suggesting that there may be minimal ben efit in extending treatment beyond 
a total of 2 years.172
Collectively, these data suggest that there is minimal if any b enefit derived from continuing I-O 
treatment beyond two years in advanced tumors. However, even th ough immunotherapy is well 
tolerated, patients will be at risk for additional toxicity wit h longer term tr eatment. There fore, in 
this study, treatment will be gi ven for a maximum of 2 years fr om the start of study treatment.

1.4.1 Nivolumab
1.4.1.1 Summary of Nivolumab Clinical Activity in the Metastatic Setting
The PK, clinical activity, and safety of nivolumab have been as sessed in approximately 70 clinical 
studies sponsored by BMS, Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (ONO), or  other partners.
Approximately 12,300 subjects have received nivolumab in single - or multiple-dose Phase 1/2/3 
studies or studies with nivolumab in combination with other the rapeutics (ipilimumab, cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, anti-angiogenics, and targeted therapies). 
Nivolumab monotherapy is approved in multiple countries, includ ing the US and EU, for 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma, previously treated metasta tic NSCLC, and previously 
treated advanced RCC; it is also approved for the tr eatment of cHL in the US. In addition,

nivolumab has been approved for use in combination with ipilimu mab for unresectable melanoma 
in multiple countries, including the US and EU.
Nivolumab has demonstrated durable responses exceeding 6 months  as monotherapy and in 
combination with ipilimumab in se veral tumor types, including N SCLC, melanoma, RCC, 
classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL), small cell lung cancer (SCL C), gastric cancer, urothelial 
cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma,  and colorectal cancer. In con firmatory trials, nivolumab as 
monotherapy demonstrated a statist ically si gnificant improvement in OS as compared with the 
current standard of care in subjects with advanced or metastati c NSCLC, unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma, advanced RCC, or SCCHN. Nivolumab in combination with  ipilimumab improved 
PFS and ORR over ipilimumab alone in subjects with unresectable  or metastatic melanoma. 
Additional details on the efficac y profile of nivolu mab, includ ing results from clinical studies, are 
available in the nivolumab IB.
1.4.1.2 Summary of Nivolumab Safety in the Metastatic Setting
The overall safety experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in combination with other 
therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 12,300 su bjects treated to date.
For monotherapy, the safety profile is similar across tumor typ es. There is no pattern in the 
incidence, severity, or causalit y of AEs to nivolumab dose leve l. In Phase 3 controlled studies, the 
safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is acceptable in the co ntext of the observed clinical 
efficacy, and manageable us ing established safet y guidelines. A p attern of immune-related adverse 
events has been defined, for which management algorithms have been developed; these are 
provided in Appendix 2. Most high-grade events were manageable with the use of cortic osteroids 
or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed  in these algorithms. For 
additional material, see the nivoluma b Investigator Brochure.

1.4.2 Nivolumab Combined with Ipilimumab
1.4.2.1 Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Mechanism of Action
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the  premise that tumors can be re cognized as foreign rather than 
as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune 
response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveilla nce of tumor antigens expressed on 
cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune response and cancer cell d eath. The 
immune surveillance functions by limiting th e emergence of tumors as they arise and/or causing 
tumor shrinkage. Tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells 
to evade immune surveillance a nd an effective immune response. This evasion may occur by 
exploiting any of the checkpoints that control the regulatory i mmune response, including display 
of antigens and control of co-stimulatory pathways that affect the proliferation of cells involved in 
immunity. Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the ap parent tolerance of the immune 
system to tumor cells and antigens by either introducing cancer antigens by therapeutic vaccination 
or by modulating regulatory checkpoints of the immune system, e ither directly by stimulation of

immune cells by anti bodies dir ected to receptors  on T and B cel ls or indirectly by cytokine 
manipulation. T-cell stimulation is a complex process involving the integration of numerous 
positive, as well as negative, co-stimulatory signals in additi on to antigen recognition by the T-
cell receptor (TCR). Collectively, these signals govern the balance between T-cell activation and 
tolerance to antigens.
Programmed death recep tor-1 (PD-1, CD279), a 55 kD type I trans membrane protein, is a member 
of the CD28 family of T-cell co-s timulatory receptors that also includes CD28, CTLA-4, ICOS, 
and BTLA.2 PD-1 contains an intracellular membrane proximal imm unoreceptor tyrosine 
inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal immunoreceptor ty rosine-based switch motif 
(ITSM). Two ligands specific for PD-1 have been identified: PD- L1 (B7-H1/CD274) and PD-L2 
(B7-DC/CD273). PD-L1 and PD-L2 have been shown to down-regulate  T-cell activation upon 
binding to PD-1 in both murine and human systems. PD-1 delivers a negative signal by the 
recruitment of SHP- 2 to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue in the ITSM in its cytoplasmic region. 
PD-1 is primarily expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells. Further evidence for 
a negative regulatory role of PD-1 comes from studies of PD-1-d eficient mice. PD-1-deficient 
mice develop various autoimmune phenotypes, including dilated c ardiomyopathy, a lupus-like 
syndrome with arthritis and ne phritis, and accelerated diabetes  mellitus. The emergence of these 
autoimmune phenotypes is dependent upon the genetic background of the mouse strain and many 
of these phenotypes emerge at different times and show variable  penetrance. In addition to the 
phenotypes of null mutations, PD-1 inhibition by antibody-media ted blockade in several murine 
models has been found to play a role in the development of auto immune diseases such as 
encephalomyelitis, graft-versus-host disease, and type I diabet es. Taken together, these results 
suggest that PD-1 blockade has the potential to activate anti-s elf T-cell re sponses, but these 
responses are variable and dependent upon various host genetic factors. Thus, PD-1 deficiency or 
inhibition is not accompanied by a universal loss of tolerance to self-antigens.
Preclinical animal models of tumors have shown that blockade by  PD-1 by monoclonal anti bodies 
(mAbs) can enhance the anti-tumor immune response and result in  tumor rejection. Antitumor 
activity by PD-1 blockade functions in PD-L1-positive tumors as  well as in tumors that are 
negative for the expression of PD-L1. This suggests that host m echanisms (ie, expression of PD-
L1 in antigen-presenting cells) limit the antitumor response. C onsequently, both PD-L1 positive 
and negative tumors may be targeted using this approach. In hum ans, constitutive PD-L1 
expression is normally limited to macrophage-lineage cells, alt hough expression of PD-L1 can be 
induced on other hematologic cells as well, including activated  T cells. However, aberrant 
expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has been reported in a numbe r of human malignancies. PD-L1 
expressed by tumor cells has been shown to enhance apoptosis of  activated tumor-specific T cells 
in vitro. Moreover, the e xpression of PD-L1 may protect the tumor cells from the inducti on of 
apoptosis by effector T cells.
Nivolumab (BMS-936558; anti-PD-1 mAb) is a fully human monoclon al immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 
antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) cell surfa ce membrane receptor, a negative 
regulatory molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes. Blockade of the PD-1pathway 
by nivolumab was studied using the mixed lymphocyte reaction (M LR). PD-1 blockade resulted

lymphoma-4 antige n (CTLA-4). Ipilimumab is an approved therapy f or m etastatic melanoma and 
has demonstrated improved overall s urvival as monotherapy and in  combination with

therapies including chemotherap y for squamous and non-squamous NSCLC and radiotherapy for

1.4.2.2 Summary of Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab Safety Data
Several doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab are currently being e xplored in ongoing clinical trials. 
Although the optimal doses have not yet been defined across mul tiple tumor types, the largest 
studies to date have been done in melanoma at a dose of nivolum ab 1 mg/kg combined with 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg administered IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses fo llowed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg 
IV every 2 weeks. These studies include subjects with previousl y untreated unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma in CA209067 (313 subjects) and CA209069 (94  subjects) (a total of 
407 subjects). Based on the pooled analyses, nivolumab 1 mg/kg c ombined with ipilimumab 
3 mg/kg administered IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by ni volumab 3 mg/kg IV every 
2 weeks has an acceptable safety profile, as demonstrated by the  frequency, severity, and types of 
AEs, drug-related deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuat ion as described below. 
Additional details  on safety a nd clinical activity of nivolumab pl us ipilimumab combinations are 
described in the I B.131
The following we re the key sa fety findings for these pooled subjects:
•The most frequently reported drug-related AEs of any grade ( ≥15% of subjects) were 
diarrhea (43.0%), fatigue (35.4%), pruritus (33.4%), rash (31.0%), nausea (24.8%), pyrexia 
(18.7%), ALT increased (18.2%), AST increased (16.7%) and decre ased appetite (16.2%). 
The most frequently reporte d drug-related Grade 3 - 4 AEs ( ≥5% of subjects) were colitis 
(9.6%), diarrhea (8.80%), ALT increased (8.4%), lipase increased (8.4%), and AST increased 
(5.9%).
•The majority of drug-related SAEs were Grade 3 - 4 in severity. The most frequently 
reported drug-related SAEs of any grade ( ≥2% of subjects) were colitis (11.1%), diarrhea 
(8.8%), pyrexia (3.7%) , pneumonitis  (2.7%), hypophys itis (2.2%) , transaminases increased 
(2.2%), and adrenal insufficiency (2.0%). The majority of drug- related SAEs were 
Grade 3 - 4. The most frequently reported drug-related Grade 3 - 4 SAEs (≥2% of subjects) 
were colitis (8.8%), diarrhea (5.7%), and transaminases increased (2.2%).
•Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 36.4% of subjects. The majority of 
drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were Grade 3 - 4 in severity. The 
most frequently reported drug-related AEs of any grade leading to discontinuation of study 
drug (≥2% of subjects) were colitis (10.1%), diarrhea (7.4%), ALT incr eased (4.7%), and

AST increased (4.2%). These were also the most frequently repor ted drug-related Grade 3 - 4 
SAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug ( ≥2% of subjects).
•The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories with nivolumab + ipilimumab 
combination therapy were skin (61.9%), GI (46.4%), endocrine (29.7%), and hepatic (29.0%). The majority of select AEs were considered by the investigators to be related to 
study treatment.
•Drug-related select AEs were mostly Grade 1 - 2 in all categories with the exception of 
hepatic select AEs where the majority were Grade 3 - 4.
•Across categories, the majority of high-grade events subsequent ly resolved, including those 
for which immunosuppressive medication was not initiated.
•The majority of deaths (80/105) were due to disease progression.  Study drug toxicity was 
considered responsible for 2 deaths; 1 subject died of ventricu lar arrhythmia within 30 days 
of the last dose and the other died of pneumonitis between 31 a nd 100 days of the last dose.
•Abnormalities in select hematology a ssessments and liver/kidney function tests were 
primarily Grade 1 - 2 in severity.
•The immunogenicity of nivolumab was low and not clinically mean ingful. 
In general, the frequency of adve rse events was lowest across A E categories in the nivolumab 
monotherapy group and highest in the nivolumab + ipilimumab gro up. However, the types and 
frequency of AEs reported in the nivolumab + ipilimumab group w ere as expected based on the 
mechanism of action of the two agents and were consistent with previously reported data. 
Additional toxicity, including a higher frequency of Grade 3 - 4  AEs, was observed in the 
nivolumab+ipilimumab group r elative to the  ipilimumab group, leading to a higher frequency of 
discontinuation from study treatment. The most frequently repor ted select AE categories were 
skin, GI, endocrine, and hepatic. Select AEs belonging to these  categories were reported more 
frequently in the nivolumab+ipilimumab group than the ipilimuma b group. The majority of events 
were manageable. In summary, resu lts to date suggest that the s afety profile of 
nivolumab+ipilimumab combination therapy is consistent with the  mechanisms of action of 
nivolumab and ipilimumab. The nature of the AEs is similar to t hat observed with either agent 
used as monotherapy; however, both frequency and severity of most AEs are increased with the 
combination.

−BMS-986016 did not i nduce cytokine release when presented to hu man PBMCs
regardless of concentration, donor, or incubation time. The leve ls of cytokines observed
were either at or near the assay lower limits of quantification  with no evidence of dose-
dependence or pattern across donors (IL-1 β, IL-2, IL-5, IL-10, IL- 12p70, and IFN- γ) or 
were generally overlapping with cytokine levels from PBMCs incub ated with negative

−Consistent with the lack of cytokine r elease, there was no evidence that BMS-986016 
induced T or NK cell activation, as measured by surface express ion of CD25 and CD69. 
Expression levels of these markers on T and NK cells following s timulation with BMS-
986016 were similar to those observed upon stimu lation with nega tive controls.
−Overall, these data indicate that BMS-986016 does not possess a gonistic potential to
induce either T or NK cellular activation or cytokine release.
1.4.3.3 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics
Relatlimab demonstrated fa vorable PK properties in cynomolgus mo nkeys. From both single-dose 
and repeat-dose IV PK studies, relatlimab d ecayed bi-e xponentially and the exposure was 
approximately dose-proportional. The  systemic clearance (CLTp) ranges from 0.12 to 0.22 
mL/h/kg and a terminal half-life (T-HALF) 133 to 414 hours. Co- administration with nivolumab 
did not appear to affect exposure to relatlimab. The volume of distribution at steady state ( Vss) 
was 62 to 72 mL/kg, suggesting limited distribution outside the  plasma. Anti-BMS-986016 
antibodies were detected in some monkeys but the presence of an ti-BMS-986016 antibodies 
appeared to have no impact on BMS-986016 exposure.
1.4.3.4 Clinical Pharmacology
The current Phase 1 clinical program is evaluating advanced solid tumors (sp ecial focus in non-
small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], renal cell carcinoma, and malig nant melanoma) in Study CA224-
020 and relapsed refractory hemato logical malignancies (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas) 
in Study CA224-022. As of 29-Jun-2016, 89 subjects have been tr eated with relatlimab in these 2 
ongoing studies assessing PK, clinical activity, and safety. An  interim determination of r elatlimab
multiple dose PK was carried out using all available serum conc entrations data from Studies 
CA224 020 and CA 224 022. In general, the Cmax and area under th e concentration versus time 
curve over the dosing interval (AUC[TAU]) values over the first dosing interval increased 
approximately equal to the incr ement in the relatlimab dose. The  PK of BMS 986016 and 
nivolumab was not altered whe n given in com bination. Relatlimab concentration time data were 
reasonably described by  population PK model with linear , 2 compartment, zero-order IV infusion 
model with first  order elimination. Th e model estimated mean T-HALF was 19 days, and the 
typical CLT was 13.7 mL/h. The population PK model w ill be used to understand the source of 
variability in relatlimab PK and effect of intrinsic and extrins ic factors.
Currently available data suggest that relatlimab monotherapy exhibits a low level of 
immunogenicity, with 6 out of 42 subjects having at least 1 pos t-baseline positive anti- drug 
antibody (ADA) samples. There are limited data available in com bination cohort to make inference 
on immunogenicity rate.

1.4.4 Daratumumab
1.4.4.1 Summary of Daratumumab Clinical PharmacologyDaratumumab is a first-in-class immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ)  human monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) that specifically binds to the CD38 protein expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma 
tumor cells and other cell types at various levels. In vitro, d aratumumab can induce tumor cell lysis 
through complement dependent cytot oxicity, antibody-dependent c ell-mediated cytotoxicity, and 
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in malignancies expres sing CD38. 
The population pha rmacokinetic (PK) analysis included patients with multiple myeloma who 
received daratumumab. Over the dose range from 1 to 24 mg/kg, A UC increases more than dose-
proportionally. Clearance decreases with increasing dose and re peated dosing, i ndicating target-
mediated pharmacokinetics. Following the recommended dose and s chedule, the Cmax at the end 
of weekly dosing is 2.9-fold higher than following the first in fusion. Daratumumab steady state is 
achieved approximately 5 months into the every 4-week dosing pe riod and the Cmax at steady-
state to Cmax after the first dose is 1.6. The mean (SD) linear clearance and mean (SD) central 
volume of distribution are estimated to be 171.4 (95.3) mL/day and 4.7 (1.3) L, respectively. The 
mean (SD) estimated terminal half-life associated with linear c learance is approximately 18 (9) 
days. Population PK analyses indicated that the central volume of distribution and clearance of 
daratumumab increase with increasing body weight, s upporting th e body weight-based dosing 
regimen. Population PK analyses also show that age (31-84 years ), gender, mild to severe renal 
impairment (15 to 89 mL/min) and mild hepatic impairment do not  have clinically important 
effects on the pharmacokinetics of daratumumab. 
Exposure-response anal yses for efficacy and safety were conduct ed using data from trials GEN501 
and MMY2002. The exposure-efficacy analysis shows that ORR incr eases with increasing 
daratumumab concentration, with a plateau achieved at daratumum ab maximal pre-infusion 
concentrations (Cpre- infusion, ma x) ≥ 270 μg /mL. Furthermore, the median progression free 
survival (PFS) appears shorter in patients with daratumumab Cpre -infusion,max < 270 μg/mL (1.9 
month) and longer (6.6 months) in those with daratumumab concen trations > 270 μg/mL. 
However, this analysis was confounded by baseline risk factors such as disease severity. There 
was no exposure-safety relations hip for infusion related reacti ons (IRR), thrombocytopenia, 
anemia, neutropenia and lymphopenia within the exposure range f rom 0.1 to 24 mg/kg studied in 
trials MMY2002 and GEN501.1.4.4.2 Summary of Daratumumab Clinical Activity
Based on the preclinical activity of daratumumab, a phase 1/2 s tudy was initiated in MM patients 
with relapsed/refractory disease (GEN501 study).
157In the first-in-human dose-escalation part of 
the study the maximum-toler ated dose was not reached with dose levels up to 24 mg/kg. In t he 
phase 2 part of the study, patients with a median of 4 prior li nes of therapy (majority refractory to 
lenalidomide and bortezomib) were treated with daratumumab at a  dose of 8 mg/kg or 16 mg/kg. 
The overall response rate (at least PR) was 36% in the 16 mg/kg  cohort and 10% in the 8 mg/kg 
group. Remarkably, in this extensively pretreated group of pati ents, 2 out of 42 patients treated 
with 16 mg/ kg daratumumab achieved a first complete response. The median P FS in the 8 mg/kg

and 16 mg/kg groups were 2.4 and 5.6 months, respectively. The 12-month survival was 77% for 
both groups. The most frequent adverse events were infusion-rel ated reactions, which occurred in 
71% of patients. The majority of these reactions included grade  1 and 2, and characterized by 
rhinitis, cough, headache, pyrexia, and dyspnea. Most i nfusion-r elated reactions occurred during 
the first daratumumab infusio n and only few patients (<10%) had  infusion-r elated reactions with 
more than one infusion. 
The SIRIUS (MMY2002) st udy c onfirmed the resu lts from GEN501 study that demonstr ated 
single agent activity of daratumu mab with a favorable toxicity profile.158One hundred six patients, 
with a median of 5 prior lines of therapy (95% refractory to le nalidomide and bortezomib), 
received daratumumab monotherapy at a dose of 16 mg/kg. At leas t a PR was achieved in 29% of 
patients with stringent CR in 3%. The median duration of respon se was 7.4 months. The median 
progression-free surviv al was 3.7 months and 1-year overall survival was 65%. Notably, s ubgroup 
analysis showed that in the group of patients who were refracto ry to lenalidomide, pomalidomide, 
bortezomib and carfilzomib, PR or better was achieved i n 21% of  these patients. Infusion-related 
reactions were obse rved in 43% of the patients and were predomi nantly grade 1 and 2, and could 
be managed with interruption of the i nfusion or extra corticoste roids and antihistamines. In 
conclusion, results from these studies show that daratumumab is w ell tolerated and that in the 16 
mg/kg cohort at leas t a partial response can be achieved in 29- 36% of the patients.157,175,176
Virtually all patients with PR or CR, achieved 50% reduction in  tumor load within 3 months after 
start of therapy. Based on preclinical evidence showing potential benefit of comb ining daratumumab with 
lenalidomide.
177,178,179another phase 1/2 study is currently evaluating the combination  o f  
daratumumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in relapsed/ref ractory MM (GEN503; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Preliminary safety data show a manageable toxicit y profile and high efficacy of 
this three-drug regimen.180,181
Daratumumab has also been shown to be safe, tolerable and effic acious when combined with other 
immunomodulatory agents in two separate Phase 3 trials combinin g daratumumab with 1) 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (POLLUX) and pomalidomide and de xamethasone (CASTOR). 
In the POLLUX trial, lenalidomide-dexamethasone was combined wi th or without daratumumab 
in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma with 1-3 previous lines of therapy (patients with 
lenalidomide-refractory disease were excluded).182In this study the daratumumab treated patients 
had a significantly higher CR rate and an unprecedented improve ment in the PFS (HR: 0.37). 
There was no additional toxicity when daratumumab was added to lenalidomide-dexamethasone, 
except for infusion-related reactions, which occurred in approximately half of the patients mostly 
during the first infusion. Another phase 3 trial compared borte zomib-dexamethasone with or 
without daratumumab (CASTOR).183Also in this study there was a significant improvement in 
CR rate, leading to a significant improvement of the PFS (HR: 0 .39). Also in the CASTOR study 
daratumumab did not add toxicity to bortezomib-dexamethasone, except for infusion-related 
reactions occurring in approximately half of the patients, most ly during the first infusion of 
daratumumab.

1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
There is a significant unmet med ical need for subjects with vir us positive tumors including 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric, Merkel cell carcinoma, cervi cal/vulvar/vaginal/anal 
canal/penile, or SCCHN as outlined in Section 1.1 . Virus positive tumors may have distinct 
patterns of immune responses and tumor immune microenvironments ( Section 1.1.4 ); therefore, a 
strong rationale exists to support blocking the PD-1 signaling pathway with the goal of improving 
patient outcomes in the metastatic/recurrent settings. In the met astatic setti ng, subjects with virus-
positive tumors generally have limited tr eatment options with high mor tality rates, and NCCN 
guidelines recommend clinical trials as an option for each of the tumor types in this trial.
Extensive details on the saf ety profile o f nivolumab are av ailable in the Investigator Brochure, and 
will not be repeated herein.Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy as well as  in combination with ipilimumab 
is manageable and generally consistent across completed and ong oing clinical trials with no MTD 
reached at any dose tested up to 10 mg/kg. Most AEs were low-gr ade (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively 
few related high-grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or 
causality of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level.
A pattern of immune -related adverse events has been defined, fo r which management algorithms 
have been developed; these are provided in Appendix 2 . Most high-grade events were manageable 
with the use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed 
in these algorithms. Additional details on the safety profile of nivolumab, includin g results from other clinical studies, 
are also available in the nivolumab IB.
The combination of nivolumab plus relatlimab has the potential for increased benefit compared 
to monotherapy targeting the PD-1 pathway, ie, nivolumab monoth erapy. In the nonclinical GLP 
toxicology study, lymphoplasmacy tic infiltration in the choroid plexus (and spinal cord) was 
reported at the highest doses of anti-PD-1 antibody (3/6 animals) and the anti-LAG-3 + anti-PD-1 
antibody combination (5/6). Importantly, these findings were no t reported with anti-LAG-3 
antibody alone either the 30 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg (highest dose).
These are nonspecific histopathology changes, without clinical manifestations in all but one of the 
animals tr eated with combin ation therapy, which have been observed in other studies with 
antibodies and small molecules in monkeys. Three subjects have experienced treatment related 
and immune mediated aseptic meningitis that have responded to i mmunosuppressive therapy. 
Vigilance regarding the communication and evaluation of potenti al neurologic toxicity remains an 
ongoing priority.
Therapy with relat limab and nivolumab is i nvestigational and it is possible that a higher incidence 
of immune mediated-adverse events may occur with the combinatio n of 2 antibodies targeting T 
cells. The immune-related grade 5 myocarditis event prompted cl oser monitoring of subjects with 
ECGs and troponins, as well as tighter eligibility criteria reg arding baseline ejection fraction and 
history of cardiovascular disease. Unanticipated side effects e vents may also occur, like the Grade

4 VF that was also reported in combination therapy, Part B. The re were several confounding 
factors in this case but, in the absence of a clear etiology, t he event was considered treatment-
related. In the setting of troponin surveillance three cases of  grade 1 myocarditis have been 
documented and managed without progression to subsequent cardiac  dysfunction. Adverse events 
and SAEs will continue to be reviewed expeditiously by the Medi cal Monitor, investigators and 
the Pharmacovigilance group to monitor safety . With 243 subjects treated with combination 
therapy as of the clinical cut- off date, the overall sa fety pro file of relatlimab + nivolumab currently 
appears similar to nivolumab monotherapy.
The potential direct benefit to subjects who participate in the CA224020 study is that both single-
agent and combined therapy with these investigational agents ma y result in a greater proportion of 
subjects with stabilization of disease, objective response, or increased duration of response than 
those observed with nivolumab monotherapy. It is also possible that combination therapy may 
reverse LAG-3-mediated T cell exhaustion and achieve responses in 1) tumor types known to be 
unresponsive to nivolumab; 2) tumors refractory to anti-CTLA4 a nd anti PD-1 or anti PD L1 
antibody therapy; and/or 3) virally-associated tumors. In fact,  multiple RECIST1.1 defined partial 
responses have been observed with relatlimab monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab, 
both in the immunotherapy naive, as well as the anti-PD-1 resis tant setting. More specifically, first 
disclosure of the initial efficacy at ASCO 2017 showed an ORR o f 12.5% in advanced melanoma 
subjects that have progressed on prior anti-PD1/PDL1 with an ev en more encouraging ORR of 
20% in subjects with significant LAG-3 expression in tumor asso ciated immune cells. Thus, the 
potential for direct benefit in subjects with few if any altern ative treatment options has been 
initially demonstrated, warranting continued evaluation of the combination across tumor types 
while extending testing in the melanoma prior IO population.
Based on preliminary data as of the clinical cutoff date of 15- Jun-2017, the safety profile of 
relatlimab in combination with nivolumab is manageable, with no  maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
reached at the tested doses up to 160 mg relatlimab and 240 mg nivolumab (flat dose, every 2 
weeks [Q2W]), with evaluation of the 240 mg relatlimab/240 mg ni volumab combination dose-
level ongoing. At the time of the clinical cutoff date (15-Jun- 2017) one dose- limiting toxicity 
(DLT) of Grade 5 myocarditis was observed at the 240 mg relatlimab/240 mg nivolumab 
combination dose level among five evaluable subjects. There was  no dose relationship between 
the incidence, severity, or causality of adverse events (AEs) t o combination therapy. In the nine 
expansion cohorts, a total of 262 subjects were treated with 80 mg relatlimab and 240 mg 
nivolumab Q2W. Most AEs were low grade (Grade 1 to Grade 2) wit h a total of 26 subjects 
experiencing a drug-related serious adverse event (SAE). All AE s, except for one Grade 5 
myocarditis and one Grade 4 drug-induced liver injury (DILI), w ere reversible and manageable by 
withholding study  drug administr ation providing standard medical care, and/or following immune-
related AE algorithms. In su mmary the safety profile of the  combination of relatlimab and 
nivolumab appears similar to nivolumab monotherapy in terms of both frequency and severity of 
AEs.
A pattern of immune-related adverse events has been defined for  treatment with nivolumab 
monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with other immune-targ eting agents such as

relatlimab. Management al gorithms have been developed fo r these events and are provided in 
Appendix 2 . Most high-grade events are manageable with the use of cortico steroids or hormone 
replacement therapy (endocrinopathie s) as instructed in these algorithms.
Myocarditis has been observed with nivolumab monotherapy tr eatment (see nivolumab IB Section 
5.6.2). Given the grade 5 myocarditis event in the CA224020 stu dy, and the known nonclinical 
mouse double LAG-3/PD-1 knockout m yocarditis phenotype, increas ed cardiac surveillance with 
troponin measurements were instituted. As of the clinical cutof f date of 15-Jun-2017 there have 
been four grade 1 myocarditis cases (asymptomatic troponin elev ations with imaging correlate of 
myocardial inflammation but without evidence of cardiac dysfunc tion). Treatment was delayed in 
all cases, and precautionary steroid treatment was given withou t any of the particip ants developing 
evidence of cardiac dysfunction.
Additional safety measures for cardiovascular risks implemented  for subjects receiving 
combination treatment with Combo C have been added to the protocol: 
•Exclusion of subjects with history of myocarditis, regardless o f etiology.
•Exclusion Criteria  under significant cardiac events: history of 2 or more myocardi al infarctions 
(MIs) OR 2 or more coronary revascularization procedures.
•Screening left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment ( if not performed in the last 6 
months) with documented LVEF ≥ 50% by either transthoracic echoc ardiogram or multiple 
gated acquisition scan (transthoracic echocardiogram being the preferred test) for subjects.
•Increased emphasis in clinical monitoring of subjects for signs a nd symptoms of cardiovascular 
toxicities during training meetings and safety teleconferences.
•Addition of pre-dose ECG testing.
•Addition of troponin laboratory testing.
Daratumumab induces antimyeloma effects via multiple mechanisms  of action. An additional 
mechanism of action has been proposed in which tr eatment with daratumumab eliminates a 
population of highly immunos uppressive CD38+ Tregs, T- cell MDSCs, and Bregs and thus 
stimulates T -cell eff ector functions.165This immunomodulatory effects of daratumumab, 
specifically its ability to promote T- cell expansion and activation, are expected to potentiate the 
effect of anti-PD-1 antibody. The combination of nivolumab plus daratumumab is expected to 
potentiate the effect of nivolumab by sensitizing the bone marr ow T cells to PD- 1 blockade, which 
would translate in augmented clinical benefit.
Daratumumab is approved as monothera py for third line tr eatment of MM patients who fa iled prior 
therapies.157,158Recent reported results demonstrated safety and efficacy when combined with 
other immunomodulatory therapies in second line MM, including l enalidomide and 
dexamethasone.175
Daratumumab’s primary adverse events includes i nfusion reaction s, which are reported to be 
uncommon with nivolumab alone (Nivolumab IB). However, infusion related reactions to 
daratumumab occur in close to 50% of the p atients, largely with  the first infusion. According to

BMS-936558 nivolumab
the currently approved United S tates Prescribing Information (U SPI), daratumumab i nfusions 
should be interrupted for i nfusion r eactions of any severity, and drug should be permanently 
discontinued in case of life-threatening infusion reactions. Pr e-infusion and post-infusion 
medication s hould be administered to all patients, per the currently a pproved USPI. Severe
infusion related reactions have been reported in less than 1% o f subjects in clinical trials with 
nivolumab, with overall rates of i nfusion r elated reacti ons of any grade ranging from 1% to 6%. 
The risk of infusion reactions is greater with the first and se cond infusions with daratumumab and 
decreases for subsequent doses. Therefore, to minimize the like lihood of infusio n related r eactions 
to the nivolumab and daratumumab combinations, the first nivolu mab dose is administered at week 
3 (ie, after the first two doses of daratumumab at weeks 1 and 2). Further, on each dosing day when 
nivolumab is administered with daratumumab, the required pre-in fusion medication for 
daratumumab is administered first, followed by infusion of nivo lumab then infusion of 
daratumumab and then administra tion of daratumumab post-infusion medications.
Other AEs of any grade reported in a high frequency (>25%) of da ratumumab treated subjects 
include low grade fatigue and nausea which have been associated  with nivolumab treatment. Only 
one severe AEs (Grade 3/4) of pneumonia has been reported with daratumumab (>5% frequency). 
Pneumonia is considered uncommon with nivolumab as reported in the USPI; however, severe 
cases have been reported. The hematologi cal AEs that have been re ported following treatment with 
daratumumab (anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia ), which are common in 
subjects with hematolog ical malignancies, are not exp ected to be observed in subjects with solid 
tumors. In contrast to nivolumab, there have been no cases of i mmune related AEs, including 
pneumonitis, reported in the label for daratumumab. Based on th e above assessment, the potential 
benefit of combining nivolumab and daratumumab appears to outwe igh the potential risk. The 
overall risk/benefit assessment supports the evaluation of thes e combinations in this setting.
It is possible that unforeseen or unanticipated AEs may occur. In order to min imize the overall 
risks to participating subjects, the protocol has inclusion-exc lusion criteria appropriate to the 
population, and specific follow-up safety assessments. Routine safety monitoring for all the AEs 
described above will be implemented in the protocol to ensure that we are monitoring the potential for overlapping toxicities.
Adverse events and SAEs will continue to be reviewed expeditiou sly by the Medical Monitor, 
investigators and the Pharmacovigilance group to monitor safety .
For subjects with local or locally advanced virus-positive tumo rs that are amenable to therapies 
with curative intent ( neoadjuvant cohort of this study), there are multiple treatment options 
including perioperative chemot herapy, radiati on, and/or observa tion post-resection depending on 
the disease stage and intraoperative findings. To minimize any delay to receiving treatment with 
curative intent, only two doses of nivolumab will be administere d q2 week. This will coincide with 
the time when subjects are being scheduled for surgery and othe r perioperativ e treatments; 
therefore, minimal delays are expected. Furthermore, based on t he known safety and tolerability 
profile of nivolumab, it is unlikely that adverse events from n eoadjuvant administration will risk 
delaying surgery or receipt of standard of care. Prior preceden t for the safety of perioperative

checkpoint inhibition has been established in a Phase I bladder  cancer study with ipilimumab (see 
Section 1.1.3 ). In addition, to minimize the risk of potential delays, a two stage approach will be 
taken to stop enrollment if there are delays to surgery or chemo therapy/radiation due to a 
nivolumab-related adverse event as specified in the label in the region of treatment in more than 2 
of the first 10 subjects treated within each tumor type. Lastly,  although there are no efficacy data 
on neoadjuvant administration of nivolumab, there is potential for some clinical benefit as 
objective responses have been observed in clinical trials withi n weeks of initial treatment.  
There is risk associated with tumor biopsies, including bleedin g, infection, and pain. While there 
is no direct benefit to subjects who undergo these procedures, there is a potential that data 
generated from these samples will guide the further development of these compounds and may be 
of direct benefit for others with advanced solid tumors. 
In summary, based on the manageable safety profile of nivolumab and nivolumab in combination 
with ipilimumab, the observed clin ical activity of nivolumab and  nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab across multiple tum or types, and the ration ale for immune checkpoint inhibition for 
patients with virus-associated tumors, it is felt that the over all benefits to subjects outweigh the 
potential risks in the neoadjuvant or metastatic/recurrent setti ngs. Furthermore, the potential direct 
benefit to subjects who participate in this study of combined the rapy with nivolumab plus 
relatlimab may result in a greater proportion of subjects with s tabilization of disease, objective 
response, or increased durati on of res ponse than those observed with nivolumab monotherapy . It 
is also possible that combination therapy may reverse LAG-3 −mediated T cell exhaustion and 
achieve responses in viru s-associated tumors.
Additionally, because nivolumab and daratumumab have some overl apping toxicity profiles (i.e. 
infusion related react ion, diarrhea), it is possible that a hig her incidence of adverse events may 
occur with the combination of 2 drugs. Based on the above asses sment, the potential benefit of 
combining nivolumab and daratumumab appears to outweigh the pot ential risk. The overall 
risk/benefit assessment supports the evaluation of these combinations in this setting. Per Revised 
Protocol 06, enrollment and treatment in this cohort have been t erminated.
Depending on the clinical activity, results could form the basis for regulatory f ilings. Additional 
combination arms based on a nivol umab backbone, a nd/or expansion  of existing cohorts, may be

or BMS should also provide  the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Invest igator Brochure or product 
labeling information to be provided to subjects and any updates.  
The investigator or BMS should provide the IRB/IEC with reports,  updates and other information 
(eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative le tters) according to regulatory 
requirements or institution procedures.
2.3 Informed Consent
Investigators must ensure that subjects are clearly and fully i nformed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regardi ng clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about th e purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Loc al) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements re quired by ICH, G CP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form w ill adhere to th e ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaratio n of Helsinki.
Investigators must:1) Provide a copy of the consen t form and written information about the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study pa rticipation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood. 
2) Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.
3) Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the  subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the i nformed consent discussion. 
4) Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of th e written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior  to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.

5) If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally  acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of makin g and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the subject.
6) Revise the informed consent whenever important new informatio n becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a perso n designated by the investigator, 
should fully i nform the sub ject or the subject' s legally accept able representative or legal 
g u a r d i a n ,  o f  a l l  p e r ti n e n t  a s p e c t s  o f  t h e  s t u d y  a n d  o f  a n y  n e w  information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements , the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and reg ulatory authorities have direct 
access to subject records. The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are th e most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is an open label, multi-center, phase 1/2 trial to investi gate the safety and efficacy of 
nivolumab as a single agent or in combination with either ipilim umab, BMS-986016 (r elatlimab,
anti-LAG3 antibody), or daratumumab in viral positive and viral  negative tumor types of the 
following tumor types: Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) positive gastri c cancer, EBV positive 
nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), cerv ical cancer, HPV positive and ne gative squamous cell cancer 
of the head and neck (SCCHN), anogenital HPV associated cancers ( vaginal, vulvar, anal canal, 
penile), and Polyomavirus positive Merkel cell cancer (pMCC).
On the basis of eligibility and tumor type, patients will be en rolled into the neoadjuvant or 
recurrent/metastatic monotherapy, or assigned or randomized into  the recurrent/metastatic 
combination therapies cohorts (A, B, a nd D ). Upon approval of Revised Protocol 05, all Metastatic 
Combination Cohorts A, B, and D w ill enroll patients concurrently, and enrollment w ill be closed 
for Combination Cohort C.Combination B SCC of the cervix cohort is being expanded to add approximately 70 p atients to 
further confirm the e fficacy signal. Approximately 50 patients will be adde d to receive 
Combination B study drug as first-line treatment of their recur rent/metastatic d isease if unfit or 
unsuitable to receive platinum based therapy; and approximately 20 patients will be added to 
receive study drug as second-line treatment of their recurrent/ metastatic SCC of the cervix.

Duration of Study : The last visit will be defined as the latest survival visit in cluded in the final 
analysis of OS (ie, the latest subject death, loss to follow up,  or withdrawal of consent) for a tumor 
type within each cohort . Additional survival follow-up may continue for up to 5 years from the 
time of this analysis. The study will end once survival follow- up collection has concluded.
3.1.1 Viral Status Determination Prior to Entry
The study will e nroll prospective subjects diagnosed with gastric cancer in the Metastatic 
Monotherapy Cohort. Gastric subjects w ill provide pre-screening i nformed consent for 
determination of E BV+ viral status during the screening period and be registered in IRT. Viral 
testing will be performed locally or by a central laboratory and test results will be collected. After 
positive test result confirmation, consent for demographic and further eligibility will be collected. 
Subjects with EBV negative gastric cancer will be considered sc reen failures and will not be 
eligible for the study.
The study will enroll prospective subjects diagnosed with SCCHN . SCCHN subjects will provide 
consent, via pre-screening informed consent, for determination of HPV viral status, if prior results 
are not available during the screening period and be registered in IRT (Combo A and C). Viral 
testing will be pe rformed locally  or by a centr al laboratory and test results will be collected.  After 
viral test result is confirmed positive, consent for demographi c and further eligibility will be 
collected. If subjects decline pre-screening informed consent o r are unwilling to undergo viral 
testing, they are eligible to enroll in Combo D. However, viral  status s hould be d etermined 
retrospectively.
The requirement for viral status for each tumor type by c ohort is described below and in Table
3.1.1-1.
Neoadjuvant cohort: Confirmation of viral status is required pri or to study d rug assignment for 
SCCHN subjects enrolled. Viral testing determined more than 35 da ys prior to first dose may be 
used. For SCCHN tumor types in the neoadjuvant cohort, 21 evalua ble subjects with virus positive 
disease and 21 evaluable subjects with virus negative disease will be enrolled. No prior screening 
for Gyn (cervical, vaginal, vulvar) or MCC cohorts is necessary d ue to the high pr evalence of viral 
positivity and the technical aspects of the MCPyV assay. Viral positivity will be tested
retrospectively for MCC and Gyn tumor types.  
Metastatic monotherapy cohort: Gastric and SCCHN subjects will be tested for viral status prio r 
to study drug assignment. Gastric subjects must be EBV positive , and SCCHN subjects must be 
HPV positive to enroll in this cohort. MCC, NPC, and Gyn (cervi cal, vaginal, vulvar) subjects will 
not require viral screening prior to study entry. With the exception of gastric cancer (n=12), each 
specific tumor type in the metastatic monotherapy cohort w ill contain 23 sub jects. Subjects will 
be treated with nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or 24 months of treatment . Viral positivity will be t ested retrospectively for MCC, NPC, 
and Gyn tumor types.Metastatic combination therapy cohort - Combo A, Combo B, and Comb o C: SCCHN

will be enrolled into Combo A: MCC, HPV+ SCCHN, and NPC .With Revised Protocol 06, no 
new subjects will be randomized in the anogenital HPV associate d tumors cohorts.
Approximately 40 subjects w ith SCCHN [prior anti-PD-1 or anti-P D-L1 antibody therapy] will be 
enrolled into Combo C . As of Revised Protocol 05, enrollment will close. 
Combo D: Approximately 40 subjects with HPV positive, negative or unknown S CCHN [I-O 
naive] will be enrolled into Combo D . On 26-May-2018 enrollment was closed. Subsequently, the 
administration of daratumumab in combination with nivolumab was  terminated.

3.1.2 Neoadjuvant Cohort
The primary objective of the neoadjuvant cohort is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
neoadjuvant nivolumab administr ation in subjects with select tum or types. 
For subjects in the neoadjuvant cohort, radiographic tumor asse ssments will occur at the following 
time points (see Table 5.4.1-2 ). 
•Screening to ensure the subject has resectable disease.
•Within 7 days a nd prior to the planned s urgery or chemotherapy/r adiation
•Post-surgery (SCCHN, MCC, Gyn) or post-chemotherapy/radiation (Gyn cohort when 
appropriate) at indicated Follow-Up visit times.
All subjects must have tumor amenable to pre-treatment biopsy ( core needle); post-treatment 
biopsy will consist of the operative specimen or core needle bio psy for the cervical/vaginal/vulvar 
subjects.
Treatment within the neoadjuvant cohort w ill consist  of:
•A pre-treatment, core-needle, biops y for all subjects. (Four co re-needle biopsies, as described 
in the laboratory manual, are suggested.)
•Two doses of nivolumab will be administere d at 240 mg IV  on Day 1 and Day 15
•Surgical resections (SCCHN, MCC, Gyn), or biopsy followed by che motherapy/radiation 
(where appropriate for Gyn patients only) will occur on Day 29 ( ±7 days). No other 
pre-surgical therapy is allowed. 
•After neoadjuvant nivolumab treatment followed by surgical resect ion or biopsy, subjects 
will receive standard of care (observation, chemo and/or RT, according to physician’s 
choice). 
•Subjects who develop unresectable recurrent or m etastatic disease withi n 1 year of surgery or
chemotherapy/radiation completion may receive nivolumab at 240 mg IV every 2 weeks until 
24 months of treatment, t oxicity, or disease  progression, if medically eligible, ie, meet 
eligibility criteria f or m etastatic cohort. Written approval from the sponsor’s medical m onitor 
is required for subject to be considered eligible. Nivolumab can be administered no earlier 
than 4 weeks after the last standard of care treatment. 
•Enrollment for each tumor type in the neoadjuvant cohort will p ause after the first 
10 subjects are treated to assess safety and determine the number  of subjects with 
chemotherapy/radiation or surgical delays beyond 4 weeks from t he planned surgery date or
planned start date for chemoradiation. If ≥3 of the first 10 subjects for a single tumor type 
have delays beyond 4 weeks from the planned surgery date or pla nned start date for 
chemoradiation due to a nivolumab immune-related adverse event(s ) specified in the label in 
the region of treatment, that specific tumor cohort will close.  The remaining tumor types in 
the neoadjuvant cohort w ill not close e nrollment should a tumor type(s) close due to a delay 
in surgery due to nivolumab. If th e first 8 patients treated for  a single tumor type experience 
no delay, a pause in enrollment will not be required.

metastatic disease within 1 year of surgery or chemotherapy/radi ation and receive nivolumab can 
be found in Table 5.1-2 . 
3.1.3 Subjects in the Metast atic Monotherapy Cohort
For subjects without resectable disease, nivolumab will be administered at 240 mg every 2 weeks 
until toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or 2 4 months of treatment, whichever 
comes first. For subjects in the metastatic cohort, radiographic tumor assessments by CT 
(preferred)/ MRI will begin 8 weeks ( ±1 week) after the start of therapy and will continue every 8
weeks ( ±1 week) for the first year of treatment. CT (preferred)/MRI wil l continue every 12 weeks 
(±2 weeks) for the second year and beyond. Tumor assessments will  follow the above schedule 
until disease progression is documented. If the subject discont inues treatment prior to disease 
progression, tumor assessmen t will continue per protocol as described in Table 5.4.1-1 . Disease 
progression is defined by investigato r-assessed RECIST 1.1 criteri a. The primary endpoint of this 
cohort is objective response rate (ORR) based on investigator a ssessments, using RECIST 1.1
criteria. Exploratory endpoints include complete and partial re mission rates and durations based 
on radiological assessments. Indi vidual tumors types will be analyzed separate from each other.  
In all subjects for each tumor type, biopsy and submission of fr esh tumor tissue, or submission of 
archived tumor tissue, is mandatory for all subjects. Subjects with accessible lesions where biopsy 
is deemed safe by the Investigator should undergo biopsy per pr otocol.
3.1.4 Subjects in the Metastatic Combination Cohorts
Upon approval of Revised Protocol 05, all Metastatic Combination  Cohorts A, B, and D will enroll 
patients concurrently, and enrollment in Cohorts C will be closed. 
Subjects with SCCHN, MCC or NPC enrolled in Combo A will be tre ated with nivolumab 3mg/kg 
every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1mg/kg every 6 weeks (Combo A) for a m aximum of 24 months 
or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes 
first. Subjects with cervical cancer and anogenital HPV associated tum ors (vulvar/vaginal/anal 
canal/penile) will be ra ndomized (1:1) to tr eatment with either Combo A - nivolumab 3mg/kg 
every 2 weeks plus ipilimumab 1mg/kg every 6 weeks or Combo B - nivo lumab 1mg/kg plus 
ipilimumab 3mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks for 
a maximum of 24 months, or until disease progression, unaccepta ble toxicity, or withdrawal of 
consent, whichever comes first. With Revised Protocol 06, no ne w subjects will be randomized in 
the anogenital HPV associated tumors cohorts.
Subjects with HPV+ SCCHN with prior PD-1/PD-L1 treatment who ar e enrolled in Metastatic 
Combination Cohort (Combo C) will be t reated with BMS-986016 (rela tlimab) 80 mg plus 
nivolumab 240 mg q2w for a maximum of 24 months until disease pr ogression, unacceptable

radiological assessments. Individual tumors types will be analy zed separate from each other.  
In all subjects for each tumor type, biopsy and submission of f resh tumor tissue, or submission of 
archived tumor tissue, is mandatory for all subjects. Subjects with accessible lesions where biopsy 
is deemed safe by the Investigator should undergo biopsy per pr otocol.
3.2 Post Study Access to Therapy
At the conclusion of the study, subjects who continue to demons trate clinical benefit will be 
eligible to receive BMS supplied study drug for the maximum trea tment duration specified in 
Section 3.1 . Study drug will be provided via an extensi on of the study, a rollover study requiring 
approval by responsible h ealth aut hority and ethics committee or th rough another mech anism at 
the discretion of BMS . BMS reserves the right to terminate access to BMS supplied st udy drug if 
any of the followi ng occur: a) the marketing application is rejected by responsibl e health authority; 
b) the study is terminated due to safety concerns; c) the subject  can obtain medication from a 
government sponsored or private h ealth program; or d) therapeuti c alternatives become available 
in the local market.

from MTM (Roche). The p16 IHC should be interpreted as positive if > 70% strong 
and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining is specific to tum or cells. Testing for 
p16 will be performed prior to study drug assignment using an ap propriately 
validated test. 
(2) HPV positive status can be obtained from either the pr imary tumor or metastatic 
lymph node.
(3) For subjects in the virus neg ative neoadjuva nt cohort, HPV s tatus should be

3.4.1.1 Restricted Treatments
Restricted therapies are not prohibited but are not recommended ; consult BMS medical 
monitor/designee if the followi ng are clearly medically indicat ed:
•Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with  either corticosteroids (> 10 
mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medi cations within 14 days 
of randomization are excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids, and  adrenal replacement steroid 
doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active 
autoimmune disease.
3.4.2 Permitted Therapy
Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articu lar, intranasal, and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal rep lacement steroid doses including 
doses > 10 mg daily prednisone are permitted. A brief (less than  3 weeks) course of corticosteroids 
for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye  allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune c onditions (eg, 
delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by a contact alle rgen) is permitted.
Oral Prophylaxis for herpes zoster reactivation is recommended during the Treatment Phase. 
Initiate antiviral prophylaxis within 1 week after starting dar atumumab, and continue for 3 months 
following treatment discontinuation ( Combo D only ).
Subjects must receive pre-infusion and post-infusion medications with each dose of daratumumab, 
per the daratumumab Investigators Brochure; additional details are provided in Section 4.7.7 .  
Palliative (limited-field) radiation therapy and palliative sur gical resection are permitted if the 
following criteria are met:
•The subject is considered to have progressed at the time of palliative therapy and meets 
criteria to continue with treatment beyond progression ( Section 4.7.8 ).
•The case is discussed with the BMS medical monitor. 
•Palliative therapy must be clearly documented as such in the st udy record.
The potential for overlapping toxicities with radiotherapy and nivolumab alone or in combination 
with either ipilimumab, BMS-986016 (relatlimab), or daratumumab cur rently is not known. 
Therefore, p alliative radiotherapy is not recommended while rec eiving study drug. If palliative 
radiotherapy is required, then study drug should be withheld fo r at least 1 week before, during and 
1 week after radiation. Subjects should be closely monitored for any potential toxicity during and 
after receiving radiotherapy, and AEs considered related to radiotherapy should resolve to Grade 
≤1 prior to resuming study drug. 
Only non-target lesions included in the planned radiation field  or CNS lesions may receive 
palliative radiotherapy. Details of palliative radiotherapy sho uld be documented in the source 
records and electronic case report form (eCRF). Details in the source records should include: dates 
of treatment, anatomical site, dose administered and fractionat ion schedule, and adverse events. 
Subjects receiving limited field palliative radiation therapy w ill be considered to have unequivocal

progression of disease in the non-target lesion. Symptoms requi ring palliative radiotherapy should 
be evaluated for objective evidence of disease progression. Adm inistration of additional study drug
to subjects who received limited f ield palliative radiation s hould follow guidelines sp ecified in 
Section 4.7.8 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression.
3.4.3 Surgical Resection Following Initial Response
Investigators may choose to resect solitary lesions in subjects  with residual disease and render the 
subject free of macroscopic disease. Subjects treated in this st udy may have lesions surgically 
resected only following consul tation with the Medical Monitor and following the Week 25 tumor 
imaging assessments. If additional tumor shrinkage is noted com pared to the tumor imaging 
assessments at Week 17, it is highly encouraged that surgical re section be delayed until subsequent 
scans fail to demonstrate further shrinkage. Subjects with a co nfirmed PR who go on to have 
surgical resection of remaining disease will be considered a PR . Subjects with SD who go on to 
have surgical resection of remaining disease will be considered  a SD. Subjects may continue 
treatment after surgery. Tumor tissue of any resected solitary lesion should be submitted to BMS 
(see Section 5.6.9 ). Detailed instructions of the obtaining, processing, labeling , handling, storage 
and shipment of these specimens will be provided in a separate Procedure Manual at the time of 
study initiation.
3.4.4 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with  either corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medicat ions within 14 days of treatment 
assignment are excluded. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adren al replacement steroid doses 
> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibility to determine,  based on subject attributes (eg, allergy 
history, diabetic history and renal status ), the appropriate imaging mod ality a nd contrast regimen 
for each subject. I maging contraindications and contrast risks should be considered in this 
assessment. Subjects with renal insufficiency should be assesse d as to whether or not they should 
receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. Specific to MRI, subjects 
with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtr ation rate (eGFR) 
< 30 mL/min/1 .73m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast should 
not be given to this subject population. In additi on, subj ects are excluded from MRI if they have 
tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc.
The ultimate decision to perform  MRI in an indi vidual subject i n this study rests with the site 
radiologist, the investigator and the standard set by the local Ethics Committee.
Blood typi ng (Combo D only ).  
Blood Type, Rh, and IAT should be done before the first dose of daratumumab . Subject RBC 
phenotyping (standard or extended) is an alternative option to the IAT test, if locally required. 
Either method must be completed prior to first daratumumab infu sion. Daratumumab interferes 
with the Indirect Antiglobulin Test (IAT), which is a routine pre-transfusion test performed  to 
identify a patient’s antibodies  to minor antigens so that suita ble donor bl ood can be given for

transfusion. Daratumumab does not interfere with ABO/RhD typing . CD38 is expressed at very 
low levels on erythrocytes. Daratumumab binds to the CD38 on er ythrocytes, which results in a 
positive IAT (Indirect Coombs Test). This positive result masks  the detection of a ntibodies to 
minor antigens and may prevent or d elay bl ood banks from issuing donor blood for transfusion.
This effect occurs during daratumumab treatment and for up to 6  months after treatment ends. 
Subjects will receive a patient identification wallet card for the study that includes the blood profile 
(ABO, Rh, and IA T or phenotyping) d etermined before the first i nfusion of daratumumab along 
with information on the IAT in terference fo r healthcare providers/blood banks. Subjects are to 
carry this card throughout the treatment period and for at least 6 months after tr eatment ends. Blood 
banks can eliminate the daratumumab IAT interference with IAT b y treating reagent RBCs with 
dithiothreitol (DTT).185
Possible methods for blood banks to provide safe RBCs for trans fusion to subjects receiving 
daratumumab include:
a) Providing ABO/RhD compatible, phenotypically (standard or ext ended 
phenotyping) or genotypically matched units
b) Providing ABO/RhD compatible, K-negative units after ruling o ut or identifying 
alloantibodies using DTT-treated reagent RBCs
Uncrossmatched, ABO/RhD compatible RBC units should be administ ered if transfusion is needed 
emergently as per local blood bank practice. Despite daratumumab  binding to CD38 on 
erythrocytes, no indication of clinical significant hemolysis h as been observed in daratumumab 
studies.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug
Subjects MUST discontinue inve stigational product (and non-inve stigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for a ny of the following reasons:
•Subject’s request to stop study treatment
•Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in 
the opinion of the investigat or, indicates that continued parti cipation in the study is not in 
the best interest of the subject
•Termination of the study by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)
•Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily
incarceration for tr eatment of either a psychiatric  or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness
•For discontinuation criteria related to nivolumab-and/or ipilim umab, BMS-986016
(relatlimab) or daratumumab-related adverse events, please refer  to Sectio n 4.7.6 . 
Follow-up begins when the decis ion to discontinue a subject fro m study therapy is made 
(no further treatment with study therapy).
•Subjects will have t wo follow-up visits f or safety. Follo w-up visit 1, 35 days from the last 
dose or from the date decision is made to discontinue subject f rom the study (only

applicable for early treatment discontinuation) ( ±7 days) and follow-up visit 2 80 days 
(±7 days) after follow-up visit 1. After follow-up visit 2, subjec ts will be followed every 
3 months for ongoing drug-related adverse events until resolved , return to baseline or 
deemed irreversible, or until lost to follow- up, withdrawal of study consent, or start of a 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy.
•Subjects who discontinue study therapy for reasons other than d isease progression will 
continue to have radiographic assessments as per defined schedul e until disease 
progression, lost to follo w-up, or withdrawal of study consent.
•PK and immunogenicity samples will be collected at the first 2 follow-up visits.
In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately noti fy the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study drug w ill be permanently discontinued in 
an appropriate manner. Please con tact the Sponsor or designee with in 24 hours of awareness of 
the pregnancy. If the investigator determines a possible favora ble benefit/risk ratio that warrants 
continuation of study drug, a discussion between the investigat or and the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee must occur.
All subjects who discontinue study drug should comply with prot ocol specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5 . The only exception to this requirement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treat ment study follow-up or loses the 
ability to consent  freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily i ncarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion  of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
This study will end when analysis of the primary e ndpoint is complete. Additional survival analysis 
may be conducted for up to 5 years beyond analysis of the prima ry endpoint.
3.6 Post Study Drug Study Follow-up
In this study, overall survival is a key e ndpoint of the study . Post study follow-up is of critical 
importance and is essential to preserving subject safety a nd th e integrity of the study. Subjects who 
discontinue study drug must continue to  be followed for co llection of outcome and/or survival 
follow-up data as required and in line wit h Section 5 until de ath or the conclusion of the study.
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all treated/ randomized subjects outside of the 
protocol defined window (refer to Section 5.1 ). At the time of this requ est, each subject w ill be 
contacted to determine their survival status unless the subject  has withdrawn consent for all 
contacts or is lost to follow-up.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue study drug w ill remain in the study and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously

authorized by subject to provide this infor mation. Subjects sho uld notify the investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medic al records by the investigator, as 
to whether the withdra wal is from further tr eatment with study drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered o n the appropriate CRF page. In the
event that vital status (whether the subject i s alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available 
information should be used to determine vital status only as ap propriately directed in accordance 
with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow-up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determ ine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up with pe rsons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow-up 
is defined by the inability t o reach the subject after a minimu m of three documented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of respons e by subject t o one registered ma il letter. A ll attempts 
should be  documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is  determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third-party representative to assist in the follow- up portion of the study has 
been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the inves tigator may use a Sponsor-retained 
third-party representative to assist site staff with obtaining subject’s contact  information or other 
public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up po rtion of the study. The site staff and 
representative will consult publicly available sources, such as  public health registries and 
databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If af ter all attempts, the subject remains 
lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by the investigator s hould be 
reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.

4.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, als o known as investigational medic inal product in some regions, is 
defined as a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further informati on about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed on ly from official study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
In this protocol, the investig ational product is: nivolumab for  the neoadjuvant and metastatic 
monotherapy cohorts.
For the metastatic combination therapy cohort, the investigation al products are nivolumab and 
ipilimumab for combination therapy Combo A and B, nivolumab and BMS-986016 (relatlimab)
for combination therapy Combo C, and nivolumab and daratumumab f or combination therapy 
Combo D.4.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medicati on for preventative,  diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diag nosis, may be considered as non-
investigational products. 
Standard of care treatment will be procured by the investigator .
4.3 Storage and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug i s stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, the  study drug should not be dispensed 
and contact BMS immediately.
Study drug not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance wit h the package insert.
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes required to ensure drug is accurately ad ministered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage, administration a nd, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).
Infusion-related supplies (eg, IV bags, in-line filters, 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 5% dextrose 
injection) will not be supplied by the sponsor and should be pu rchased locally if permitted by local 
regulations.
Please refer to the current version of the Investigat or Brochure and/or pharmacy reference sheets 
for complete storage, handling, dispensing, and infusion inform ation for nivolumab, ipilimumab, 
BMS-986016 (rela tlimab), and daratumumab.

BMS-936558 nivolumab
Nivolumab is to be administered as an IV infusion. Nivolumab in fusion must be promptl y followed 
by a flush of diluent to clear the line. For Combo A and B, ipilim umab is to be administered as an 
approximately 30-minute IV infusion. At the end of the i nfusion, flush the line with a sufficient 
quantity of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution. When both stu dy drugs (nivolumab and 
ipilimumab) are to be administered on the same day, separate infu sion bags and filters must be 
used for each infusion. Nivolumab is to be administered first. T he nivolumab infusion must be 
promptly followed by a flush of diluent to clear the line of nivolumab before starting the 
ipilimumab infusion. The second infusion will always be ipilimum ab, and will start after the 
infusion line has been flushed, filters changed and patient has  been observed to ensure no infusion 
reaction has occurred. The time in  between infusions is expecte d to be approximately 30 minutes 
after completion of the nivolumab infusion.
For Combo C, where both ni volumab and BMS-986016 (relat limab) are administered, nivolumab 
will be administered first, as an a pproximately 30-minute IV infusion. At the end of the infusion,  
flush the line with a sufficien t quantity of nor mal saline or 5%  dextrose solution. When both study 
drugs (nivolumab and BMS-986016) are to be administered on the same day, separate i nfusion 
bags and filters must be used for each infusion. Nivolumab is t o be administered first. The 
nivolumab infusion must be promptly followed by a s aline flush to clear the line of nivolumab 
before starting the BMS-986016 infusion. The second infusion wil l be BMS-986016 and will start 
after the infusion line has been flushed, filters changed and patient has been observed to ensure no 
infusion reactio n has occ urred. BMS-986016 infusion will start within 60 minutes after co mpletion 
of the nivolumab infusion. Further details regarding preparatio n and administration will be 
provided separately in site/pha rmacy training materials.
For Combo D, daratumumab injection for IV infusion is considered IMP for this study. Daratumumab is an immunoglobulin G1 kappa human monoclonal anti body against CD38 
antigen, produced in a mammalian cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary [CHO]) using recombinant 
DNA technology. The molecular wei ght of daratumumab is approxim ately 148 kDa. 
Daratumumab is supplied as a colorless to pale yellow preservat ive-free solution for intravenous 
infusion in single-dose vials. Starting on week 3, when both ni volumab and daratumumab are 
administered, nivolumab will be administered first followed by daratumumab by at least 30 
minutes after completion of nivolumab infusion. 
Pre-infusion med ications should be administered be fore starting daratumumab infu sions. On days
when nivolumab and daratumumab a re both administered, daratumum ab pre-med ications may be 
administered before the start of the nivolumab infusion. Post-infusion medications s hould be 
administered upon completion of the daratumumab infusion.Therefore, the sequence of administration on days when nivolumab  and daratumumab are 
administered should be as follows:
•Daratumumab pre-i nfusion med ications
•Nivolumab infusion
•Daratumumab infusion
•Daratumumab post-i nfusion medications

Daratumumab Infusion solution will be prepared as a 1,000-mL (first dose) or 500-mL (second 
and subsequent doses) dilution of daratumumab in sterile, pyrog en-free 0.9% NaCl . Preparation 
of infusion bags s hould be done on the day of the planned i nfusion. Daratumumab must be 
administered as an IV infusion  given through a well -functioning  IV catheter by using an i nfusion 
pump. The study drug mu st be filtered by using an inline filter  (0.2 μM) during the infusion. The 
infusion rates for the first, second, and subsequent daratumuma b infusions should closely follow 
the specifications of the curre ntly approved (USPI)/pharmacy re ference manual.184Pharmacy 
manuals with detailed descriptions for preparation and administ ration of daratumumab will be 
supplied to each pharmacy and site.
Because of this high risk of infusion related reactions daratum umab infusions will be administered 
per the Investigator’s Brochure by a healthcare professional, w ith immediate access to emergency 
equipment and appropriate med ical s upport to manage i nfusion reactions if they occ ur, and all 
subjects will receive pre-infusion and post-infusion medication  per the descriptions in 
Section 4.7.7 of the protocol. 
Before administration the drug product s hould be stored and prepared as per the instructions in 
pharmacy manual. Daratumumab (dose) w ill be administered as an IV infusion. Each subject’s 
dose will be calculated based on the subject’s weight at Cycle 1 Day 1 rounded to the nearest 
kilogram. The dose of daratumumab to be administered to a subje ct will be calculated by 
multiplying the subject’s weight (kg) by 16 mg/kg. The dose of daratumumab will remain constant 
throughout the study, unless the subject’s weight ch anges more than 10% from Cycle 1 Day 1. All 
infusions will be planned as outpatient visits. Subj ects will r eceive pre-i nfusion  medications and 
post-infusion med ications as detailed in the protoc ol (Section 4.7.7). 
The infusion start and stop time will be recorded in the CRF. If the infusion is sto pped mid-session 
for any reason, the stop/start time must be recorded  together with an explanation .
The dilution volumes, initial infusion r ates, and increment for the first, second, and subsequent 
doses are provided in Table 4.3-1 . The infusion rates for the first, second, and subsequent 
daratumumab infusions s hould closely follow the specifications of the c urrently  approved 
(USPI)/pharmacy reference manual. The maximum infusion rate for all infusions is 200 mL/hour. 
Additional details for admin istration times and rates, as well as pre-i nfusion medicatio ns, will be

For subjects with a higher risk of respiratory complications (e g, subjects with mild ast hma or 
subjects with stage 2 COPD who have a known FEV1 <80% at screeni ng or developed  FEV1 
<80% during the study without any medical history) the followin g post infusion medi cations 
should be considered:
•Antihistamine (diphenhydramine or equivalent) 
•Leukotriene inhibitor (montelukast or equivalent)
•Short-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist such as salbutamol aerosol 
•Control medications for lung disease (eg, inhaled corticosteroi ds ± long-acting β2 
adrenergic receptor agonists for subjects with asthma; long-acting bronchodilators such as 
tiotropium or salmeterol ± inhaled corticosteroids for subjects  with COPD)
In addition, these at-risk subjects may be hospitalized for mon itoring for up to 2 nights after an 
infusion. If subjects are hospitalized, then their spirometry test (FEV1) should be performed before 
discharge. If these subjects are not hospitalized, then a follo w up telephone call should be made to 
monitor their condition within 48 hours after all i nfusions. If no infusion-r elated reaction has 
occurred, the follow-up telephone call 48 hours after the infusion is not required. If the subject has not experienced a significant medical event but is hospitalized  overnight only for observation, then 
the hospi talization should not be reported as a serious adverse  event. Investigators may prescribe 
bronchodilators, H1-antihistamines, and corticosteroids that ar e deemed necessary to provide 
adequate supportive care in the event a bronchospasm occurs aft er subjects are released from the 
hospital/clinic. If an at-risk s ubject exper iences no major inf usion-related reactions, then these 
post-infusion med ications may be waived after 4 doses  at the investigator’s disc retion. 
Any post-infusion medication will be administered after the inf usion has completed.

the informed consent form must be assigned a subject number in IRT. Specific instructions for 
using IRT will be provided to the investigational site in a sepa rate document.
The investigator or de signee will register the subject for enrol lment by following the enrollment 
procedures established by BMS. T he following information is req uired for enrollment:
•Confirm that informed consent was obtained
•Date of birth
•Gender at birth
•Subject Identification Method
•Which cohort the subject will be enrolled (Neoadjuvant or Metasta tic)
•Tumor type for subject
Once enrolled subjects have met all eligibility criteria the IRT must be contacted again for 
treatment assignment, drug v ial (nivolumab, nivolumab plus ipi limumab, nivolumab plus 
BMS-986016 , nivolumab plus  daratumumab), and to confirm that the Cohort/T umor Type that the 
subject would qualify for is not closed for the study. 
Upon approval of Revised Protocol 05, enro llment will be conc urrent for metastatic/recurrent 
combinations A, B, and D, and enrollment in Cohorts C will be cl osed.
The following information is required for drug vial assignment:
•Subject number
•Date of birth
•Confirmation of viral s tatus (for Neoadjuvant Cohort: SCCHN subj ects, and Metastatic 
Cohorts: Gastric and SCCHN subjects, see Table 3.1.1-1 )
Confirmation of viral status will be required prior to study dru g assignment for EBV gastric cancer 
and HPV SCCHN tumor types in the metastatic cohorts. Confirmati on of viral status will also be 
required prior to study d rug assignment for SCCHN subjects enro lled in the neoadjuvant cohort. 
Subjects with gastric cancer or SCCHN tumor types will provide consent, via pre-screening 
informed consent, for determination of viral status.Results will be entered into the IRT by sites at the screening vis it, or results will be transferred 
from the central laboratory to the IRT via an automated feed. Af ter positive test result 
confirmation, consent for demographic and further eligibility wi ll be collected. If the viral status 
result cannot be confirmed for EBV gastric cancer and HPV SCCHN  tumor types in the metastatic 
cohorts, and HPV SCCHN tumor types in the neoadjuvant cohort, those subjects will not be able 
to enter the treatment phase of the study and will be considere d enrollment failures.
If the  Cohort/Tumor Type that the subject would qualify for has already  met the maximum number 
of subjects, the subject will not be able to enter the tr eatment phase of the study and will be 
considered an enrollment failure.
The exact procedures for using the IRT w ill be detailed in the IRT manual.

Metastatic Monotherapy Cohort s ubjects will receive treatment wi th nivolumab on Day 1 of a 
treatment cycle every 2 weeks (14 days). 
Metastatic Combin ation Cohort subjects w ill be assigned to receive one  of the following dosing 
schema (starting Day 1) based on tumor type and rando mization:
•Combo A: nivolumab 3 mg/kg q2 weeks + ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q6 weeks: ±1 week
(no less than 5 weeks between doses)
•Combo B: nivolumab 1 mg/kg + ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, q3 weeks x4, f ollowed by nivolumab 
240 mg q2 weeks: +/-3 days (no less than 18 days between doses)
•Combo C: nivolumab 240 mg + BMS-986016 160 mg, q4 weeks: ±2 days.
•Combo D: daratumumab q1 week x8, q2 weeks (Weeks 9-24); q4 weeks  starting at Week 
25 + nivolumab 240 m g q2 weeks (starting at Week 3); 480 mg q4 week s starting at Week 
25. Nivolumab will be administered before daratumumab on study days when both drugs 
are administered on the same day. Dosing windows for daratumumab  are as follows:

Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for more detail. There are n o pre-medications  recommended 
on the first cycle, except for Combo D . All subjects in Combo D w ill receiv e pre-infusion and 
post-infusion medication per the descriptions in Section 4.7.7 of the protocol. If an acute infusion 
reaction is noted, subjects should be managed according to Sect ion 4.7.7.
Dosing modifications:
There will be no dose modifications allowed for the manage ment of toxicities of ind ividual 
subjects.Dosing window: 
When nivolumab is administered alone and in combination with BMS -986016 (relatlimab), 
subjects ma y be dosed no less than 12 days between doses during Q 2 week dosing. For ipilimumab 
(Combo A), subjects may be dosed within a ± 1-week window and n o less than 5 weeks from the 
previous dose. For subjects in Combo B, when nivolumab is admin istered in combination with 
ipilimumab, subjects may be dosed within a ± 3-day window and n o less than 18 days from the 
previous dose. A dose given more than 3 days after the intended dose date will be considered a 
delay, except for subjects receiving ipilimumab in Combo A. A m aximum delay of 6 weeks 
between doses is allowed, except for subjects in the Neoadjuvan t cohort.
Daratumumab will be administered at a dose of 16 mg/kg as an IV  infusion every week for the

4.7.2 Management Algorithms for Immuno-oncology Agents
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with adverse events that can differ in severity and 
duration than adverse events caused by other therapeutic classe s. Nivolumab, ipilimumab, 
BMS-986016 (relatlimab), and daratumumab are considered immuno-on cology agents in this 
protocol. Early recognition and man agement of adverse events associated with immuno-oncology 
agents may mitigate severe toxici ty. Management algorithms have  been developed to assist 
investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of adverse events:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal
•Pulmonary
•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies
•Skin
•Neurological
The safety management algorithms are provided in Appendix 2 of this protocol.
4.7.3 Dose Delay Criteria
Study drug administr ation (nivolumab, ipilimumab, and BMS-986016) should be delayed fo r the 
following:
•Grade 2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, except for fatigu e.
•Grade 3 skin, drug-related adverse event
•Grade 2 drug-related creatinine, AST, ALT, and/or total bilirub in
•Grade 3 drug-related fa tigue, nausea, vomiting, and anemia (Comb ination Cohort C only)
•Grade  3 drug-related laboratory abnormality, with the following excep tions:
−Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase does not require a dose delay
−Grade ≥ 3AST, ALT, or total bilirubi n will require dose discontinuation (Section 4.7.6 )
•All troponin elevations require a dose delay to allow for promp t cardiac evaluation (Combo C 
only)
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study drug.
•Subjects receiving ipilimumab or BMS-986016 in combination with n ivolumab that have drug-
related toxicities that meet the criteria for dose delay, shoul d have both drugs (nivolumab and 
either ipilimumab, or BMS-986016) delayed until retreatment crit eria are met.
•Subjects who require delay of study tr eatment shoul d be re-evaluated weekly or more 
frequently if clinically indicated a nd resume nivolumab dosing when re-treatment criteria are 
met.

•Subjects experiencing a Grade 3 infusion r eaction related to daratumumab must permanently 
discontinue daratumumab.
•Any adverse event deemed to be related to daratumumab that requ ires a dose hold of more than 
3 consecutive planned doses will result in permanent discontinu ation of daratumumab. If a 
dose delay occurs, th en pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments should be 
performed on the actual day of study drug administration, not o n the original scheduled

•Subjects who miss ≥3 consecutive planned doses of daratumumab fo r reasons other than 
toxicity should be w ithdrawn from study drug, unless, upon cons ultation with the sponsor and 
the review of safety and efficacy, continuation is agreed upon.  Subjects who are withdrawn 
from daratumumab may continue to receive nivolumab.
•Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study drug.
Doses of daratumumab may be delayed up to 4 weeks during Weeks 1-24 or up to 6 weeks from 
Week 25 and beyond. Any adverse event deemed to be related to d aratumumab that requires a 
dose hold longer than those specified above will result in perm anent discontinuation of 
daratumumab. If a dose delay occurs , then pharmacokinetic and p harmacodynamic assessments

Administrati on ma y resume at the next planned dosing date. A missed dose will not be made up.
Rescheduling (Combo A or B):
•Nivolumab may be delayed until the next planned ipilimumab dose  if the next ipilimumab dose 
is scheduled within the next 12 days. This will permit periodic ipilimumab dosing to be 
synchronized with nivolumab dosing.
•Ipilimumab s hould be dosed at the sp ecified interval regardless of any delays in intervening 
nivolumab doses. However, in order to maintain periodic synchron ized dosi ng of ip ilimumab 
and nivolumab, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be adjusted within the 
permitted +/- 3 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab dose s are given at least 12 days 
apart. Ipilimumab may be delayed beyond the 3 day window if needed to synchronize with the 
next nivolumab dose.
•A dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosin g for > 12 weeks requires 
ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 4.7.6 .
4.7.4 Dose Reductions
There will be no dose reductions for nivolumab, ipilimumab, BMS-9 86016 or daratumumab.
4.7.5 Criteria to Resume Dosing
Subjects may resume treatment with study drug when the drug-rela ted AE(s) resolve(s) to Grade 1 
or baseline, with the following exceptions:
•Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigu e.
•Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-r elated skin AE may res ume treatment in 
the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.
•For participants with Grade 2 AST, ALT and/or Total Bilirubin A bnormalities, dosing may 
resume when laboratory values return to baseline and management  with corticosteroids, if 
needed, is complete.
•Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have  resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Subjects with persistent Grade 1 pneumoni tis after completion of a 
steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with and 
approved by the BMS Medical Monitor.
•Subjects who received systemic corticosteroids for management o f any drug-related toxicity 
must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivale nt dose of prednisone 
≤10 mg/day.

•Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only p hysiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment after consultation with the BMS  Medical Monitor. Adrenal 
insufficiency requires discontinuation regardless of control with hormone replacement.
•Troponin elevations will require the participant to undergo a c ardiac evaluation. Following this 
evaluation, determination of furthe r treatment will be based on  the discussion with the BMS 
medical monitor/desi gnee.
•Dose delay of nivolu mab, BMS-986016 and ipilimumab (Combo B), which results in tr eatment 
interruption of > 6 w eeks requires treatment discontinuatio n, with exceptions as noted in 
Section 4.7.6.
•Dose delay of ipilimu mab in Combo A, which results in treat ment interruption of > 12 wee ks 
requires treatment dis continuation, with exceptions as noted i n Section 4.7.6. 
•Ipilimumab may not be resumed sooner than 6 weeks (+/- 3 days) after the prior ip ilimum ab 
dose for Combo A.
•In general, subjects who meet criteria to resume ipilimuma b will also have met criteria to 
resume nivolumab, so it should be feasible to synchronize dos ing of both drugs when resumi ng 
ipilimumab. In  order to fac ilitate this, the dosing days of niv olumab and ipilimumab may be 
adjusted within the permitted +/- 3 day window, as long as c onsecutive nivolumab doses a re 
given at least 12 days apart.
•One exception to note is when ipilimumab and nivolumab doses ar e delayed due to drug-
related Grade 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities not associated with symptoms or clinical 
manifestations of pancreatitis. If the investigator assesses th e Grade 3 amylase or lipase 
abnormality to be related to ipilimumab and not related to nivo lumab, nivolumab may be 
resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grad e < 3 but ipilimumab may 
only be resumed when the amylase or lipase abnorm ality resolves to Grade 1 or bas eline. 
Investigator attribution of this toxicity to the ipilimumab dos ing must be clearly noted in the 
subject's med ical chart. The BMS Medical Monitor should be cons ulted prior to resuming 
nivolumab in such subjects.
•Subjects may resume tr eatment with daratumumab in Combo D, when the toxicity has reso lved 
to Grade 2 or baseline, with the exception that Grade 2 laryngeal edema or Grade 2 
bronchospasm must be fully recovered. If the daratumumab administration does not co mmence 
within the pre-specified window of the scheduled administration  date, then the dose w ill be 
considered a missed dose. Administration may resume at the next planned dosing date.

Treatment with study drug should be permanently discontinued fo r the following:
•Any Grade 2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision t hat does not respond to 
topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within  the re-treatment period OR 
requires systemic treatment
•Any Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related adverse event lasting > 7 da ys or recurs, with the 
fo

♦Any drug-related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that mee ts the following criteria 
require discontinuation: oGrade ≥3 drug-related AST, ALT or Total Bilirubin requires discontinua tion.  
Note: * In most cases of Grade 3 AST or ALT elevation, study dru g(s) will be 
permanently discontinued. If the investigator determines a poss ible favorable 
benefit/risk ratio that warrant s continuation of study drug(s), a discussion between 
the investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor/designee must occu r.
oConcurrent AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2x ULN
•Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or laboratory abnormality (including but not limited 
to creatinine, AST, ALT, or Total Bilirubin), except for the fo llowing events, which do not 
require discontinuation:−Grade 4 neutropenia ≤7 days
−Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia or asymptomatic amylase or li pase
−Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with clinical 
sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management with in 72 hours

−Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathy adverse events such as hyper- or hypothyroidism , or 
glucose intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled  with physiologic hormone 
replacement (steroids, thyroid horm ones) or glucose-controlling  agents, respectively, may 
not require discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the BMS Medical 
Monitor.
•Daratumumab treatment should be  permanently discontinued for th e following reasons:
−Grade 4 infusion reactions related to daratumumab.
−For Grade 3 infusion reactions related to daratumumab: Once reaction symptoms resolve, consider restarting the infusion at no more than half the rate at which the reaction occurred. 
If the patient does not experience additional symptoms, resume infusion r ate escalation at 
increments a nd intervals a s outlined in Table 4.3-1 . Repeat the procedure a bove in the event 
of recurrence of Grade 3 symptoms. Permanently discontinue dara tumumab upon the third 
occurrence of a Grade 3 or greater infusion reaction 
•Any adverse event, laboratory  abnormality , or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of

•Any event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 6 weeks for Combo B and C, and > 12 
weeks for Combo A from the previous dose requires discontinuati on, with the following 
exceptions:
−Dosing delays to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage d rug-related adverse events 
are allowed. 
−Dosing delays lasting > 6 weeks (Combo A and C) or >12 weeks (Co mbo A) from the 
previous dose that occur for non-drug-related reasons may be al lowed if approved by the 
BMS medical monitor. 
For Combo A, B, and C, prior to re-initiating tr eatment in a subject with a  dosing delay lasting 
> 6 weeks (Combo B and C) and > 12 weeks (Combo A), the BMS medica l monitor must be 
consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. Periodic 
study visits to assess safety and la boratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks or more 
frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays.
The assessment for discontinuation of study drug should be made separately considering each 
study drug. If discontinuation criteria are attributed with only one drug used in this trial, once the 
subject meets criteria to resume therapy, the subject may conti nue dosing with th e remaining study 
drug not attributed to criteria for discontinuation. In the nivol umab and BMS-986016 (relat limab)
combination (Combo C), if discontinuation criteria are met, bot h drugs (nivolumab and BMS-
986016) will be discontinued regardless of the assessment of at tribution to a particular study drug.
If a subject meets criteria fo r discontinuation and investigator is  unable to determine whether the 
event is related to both or one study drug, the subject should discontinue all study drugs and be 
taken off the treatment phase of the study. Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the parti cipant with continued nivolumab dosing.
4.7.7 Treatment of Study Drug-related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab, ipilimumab, and BMS-986016 (relatlimab) contain o nly human 
immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely to be immunoge nic and induce infusion or 
hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, 
chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgias, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other 
symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions s hould be reported withi n 24 hours to the BMS 
Medical Monitor and reported as an SAE if criteria are met . Infusion r eactions should be graded 
according to NCI CTCAE (version 4) guidelines.
For subjects in the combination cohorts A, B a nd C whe n ipilimumab or BMS- 986016 (relatlimab)
are scheduled to be administered on the same day as nivolumab, if a subject has an infusion 
reaction with nivolumab, the ipilimumab or BMS-986016 (relatlim ab) infusion can be given 
(without prophylactic medications ) if the infusion reaction res olves within 3 hours. For scheduling 
purposes after a nivolumab infus ion reaction, the ipilimumab or  BMS-986016 (relatlimab) 
infusion may be given the next day. P rophylactic pre-i nfusion med ications should be given prior 
to all subsequent nivolumab infusions.

Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modifie d based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms : (Mild reaction; infusion inte rruption not ind icated; intervention not 
indicated)
•Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from sympto ms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are r ecommended for fut ure infusions: diphenhydramine 
50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to  1000 mg (acetamin ophen) at least 
30 minutes before additional study drug admin istrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or i nfusion inte rrupti on but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihis tamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophy lactic medications indicated for ≤24 
hours).
•Stop the infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and t reat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equiv alent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administer ed as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at  50% of the origi nal infusion rate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 mi nutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subjec t closely. If symptoms recur 
then no further study drug w ill be administered at that visit. Administe r diphenhydramine 
50 mg IV, and remain at bedside and monitor the subject until r esolution of symptoms. The 
amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the electronic  case report form (eCRF). 
The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: 
•Diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes befor e additional nivolumab 
administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended dos e: up to 25 mg of 
IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medicat ion and/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicat ed for other clinical sequelae [eg, 
renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life-threa tening; pressor or ventilat ory support 
indicated).
•Immediately discontinue infusion of study drug. Begin an IV inf usion of normal saline, 
and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, ep inephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a

injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 5 0 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subjec t should be monitored 
until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will no t recur. Study drug w ill be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their ins titutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject  until recovery from 
symptoms. 
In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, ap pearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomati c treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine, or corticosteroids).
Guidelines for prevention and management of daratumumab infusio n-related reactions
Prevention of Daratumumab Infusion related reactions:
•Pre-infusion med ication to be administered to all subjects approximately 1 hour  prior to every 
daratumumab infusion (can be administered before the nivolumab infusion):
oIV corticosteroid (methylprednisolone 100 mg, or equivalent dos e of an intermediate acting 
or long-acting cort icosteroid). Following the second infusion, the dose of corticosteroid 
may be reduced (methylpredni solone 60 mg I V), PLUS
oOral antipyretics (acetaminophen 650 to 1000 mg), PLUS
oOral or IV antihistamine (diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg or Leukot riene Inhibitor (optional) 
on Cycle 1 Day 1: montelukast 10 mg PO, or equivalent).
•Post-infusion medication to be administered to all sub jects to reduce the risk of delayed 
infusion reactions:
oOral corticosteroid (20 mg methyl prednisolone or equivalent dos e of a corticosteroid in 
accordance with local standards) on the first and second day af ter all infusions
oAt the investigator discretion, for subjects with a history of obstructive pulmonary disorder, 
short and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroi ds can be administered. 
Following the first 4 infusions, if  subjects experience no major  infusion reactions, these 
additional inhaled post-i nfusion medications may be discontinued. 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for infusion reactions d uring daratumumab administration. 
Trained study staff at the clinic should be prepared to interve ne in case of any infusion reactions, 
and resources necessary for resuscitation must be available. Al l subjects should have blood 
pressure monitored before and after all infusions. For the firs t two infusions, blood pressure should 
also be monitored during the infusion. There will be no dose es calations or reductions of 
daratumumab allowed. Doses of daratumumab may be interrupted, d elayed, or discontinued 
depending on how well the subject tolerates the treatment.

If an acute infusion  reaction is no ted, subjects should be mana ged according to the Investigator’s 
Brochure and as summarized below.
Management of Daratumumab Infusion related reactions:
Per Revised Protocol 06, enrollment and tr eatment in this cohort have been terminated. Subjects 
should be carefully observed during daratumumab infusions. Trai ned study staff at the clinic 
should be prepared to intervene in case of any infusion reactio ns, and resources necessary for 
resuscitation (eg, agents such as epinephrine and aerosolized b ronchodilator, also medical 
equipment such as oxygen tanks, tracheostomy equipment, and a d efibrillator) must be available 
at bedside. Attention to staffing should be considered when mul tiple subjects will be dosed at the 
same time.
Interrupt the daratumumab infus ion for infusion-related reactio ns of any severity. Management of 
infusion reactions may require further reduction in the r ate of i nfusion, or tr eatment 
discontinuation of daratumumab.
Subjects who experience adverse events during the infusion must  be treated according to the 
investigator’s judgment and best clinical practice. Subjects sh ould be treated with acetaminophen, 
antihistamine, and/or corticosteroids as needed. Intravenous sa line may be indicated. For 
bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, subjects may require antih istamines, oxygen, corticosteroids, 
or bronchodilators. For hypotension, subjects may require vasop ressors.
If an infusion is inte rrupted, then a longer-than-anticipated i nfusion time may occ ur. Overnight 
stays at the hospital because of slow infusion times s hould not be reported as serious adverse 
events. However, if the underl ying cause of the delayed infusio n time is an adverse event or serious 
adverse event, then that should be reported as such.
Infusion-related reactions of grade 1 or grade 2: Once reaction symptoms resolve, resume the 
infusion at no more than half the rate at which the reaction oc curred. If the patient does not 
experience any further reaction symptoms, infusion rate escalat ion may resume at increments and 
intervals as appropriate as outlined in Table 4.3-1 .
Grade 3 (severe): Once reaction symptoms resolve, consider restarting the infusion  at no more 
than half the rate at which the reaction occurred. If the subje ct does not exp erience additional 
symptoms, resume i nfusion rate escalation at incr ements and intervals as outlin ed in Table 4.3-1. 
Repeat the procedure above in the event of recurrence of Grade 3 symptoms. Permanently 
discontinue daratumumab upon the third occurrence of a Grade 3 or great er infusion-r elated 
reaction.
Grade 4 (life threatening): Permanently discontinue daratumumab treatment.
4.7.8 Treatment Beyond Disease Progression
Accumulating clinical evidence i ndicates some subjects treated with immune system stimulating 
agents may develop progression of disease (by conventional respo nse criteria) before 
demonstrating clinical objective responses and/or stable disease. This phenomenon was observed 
in approximately 10% of subjects in the Phase 1 study of nivolu mab and also with ipilimumab

monotherapy.186Two hypotheses have been put forth to explain this phenomenon. First, enhanced 
inflammation within tumors could lead to an increase in tumor s ize which would appear as 
enlarged index lesions and as newly visible small non-index les ions. Over time, both the malignant 
and inflammatory portions of the mass may then decrease leading  to overt signs of clinical 
improvement. Alternatively, in some individuals, the kinetics o f tumor growth may initially 
outpace anti-tumor immune activity. With sufficient time, the a nti-tumor activity will dominate 
and become clinically apparent. Therefore, subjects will be all owed to continue study therapy after 
initial investigator-asse ssed RECIST 1.1 defined progression as long as they meet the following 
criteria:
1) Investigator-assessed clinical benefit, and do not have rapid disease progression
2) Tolerance of study drug as defined by the investigator3) Stable performance status
4) Treatment beyond progression will not d elay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)
5) Subject provides a new writte n informed consent prior to receiving any additional study drug 
using an ICF describing any reasonably fores eeable risk s or discomforts, or other alternative 
treatment options
The assessment of clinical benefit should take into account whe ther the subject is clinically 
deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from cont inued treatment. 
Patients enrolled to the nivolumab  monotherapy, the nivolumab pl us ipilimumab, nivolumab plus 
BMS-986016 (relat limab), or the nivolumab plus daratumumab combina tion arms may be allowed 
to continue treatment beyond initial progression for up to a max imum of 24 months from the date 
of first dose. In this instance, subjects may continue therapy with assigned treatment.
All decisions to continue treatment be yond initial progression must be discussed with the BMS 
Medical Monitor and docu mented in the study rec ords. Subjects will be re-co nsented with an 
ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts.
Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon further evidence of further progression, defined 
as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume  from time of init ial progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions).New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial pr ogression if the longest diameter is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathol ogical lymph nodes, which must  have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). Any new lesion considere d non-measurable at the time of initial progressio n may become 
measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden measurement if the longest diameter 
increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increase in 
short axis to at least 15 mm).
For statistical analyses that include the investigator-assessed progression date, subjects who 
continue treatmen t beyond initial invest igator-assessed, RECIST  1.1-defined progression will be

4.8 Destruction of Study Drug
For this study, study drugs (those supplied by BMS or sourced b y the investigator) such as partially 
used study drug containers, vials and syringes may be destroyed  on site. 
Any unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being inspec ted and reconciled by the 
responsible Study Monitor unless study drug containers must be immediately destroyed as required 
for safety, or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxics or biol ogics). 
On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal s tandards are met:
•On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from  the drug.
•On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agr eement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
•Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and follo wed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy  provided t o BMS upon request.
•Records are maintain ed that allow for traceability of each cont ainer, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, ie, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill,  or licensed waste disposal vendor 
must be documented.
•Accountability and disposal records are complete, up-to-date, a nd available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.
If conditions for destruction cannot be met the responsible Stu dy Monitor will make arrangements 
for return of study drug.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal  of all empty con tainers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are 
kept.4.9 Return of Study Drug
If study drug will not be destroyed upon completion or terminat ion of the study, all unused and/or 
partially used st udy drug that was supplied by BMS must be retu rned to BMS. The return of study 
drug will be arranged by the responsible Study Monitor. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal  of all empty containers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are 
kept.

will also include card iac troponin levels: T (cTnT) or I (cTnI) . If the pre-dose troponin level is 
above the ULN dosing should be held, subject should undergo pro mpt cardiac evaluation, and the 
medical monitor should be notified.
Determination of safety lab results is required prior to dosing . If there are delays with obtaining 
results for certain tests, please contact the medical monitor t o determine clinical significance.
Subjects will be evalu ated for safety if they have r eceived any study drug. Toxicity assessments 
will be performed continuously during the treatment phase. During the safety follow-up phase 
(Table 5.1-6 ) toxicity assessments should be done in person. Once subjects reach the survival 
follow-up phase, either in-person visits or documented telephon e calls to assess the subject’s status 
are acceptable.
Adverse events and laboratory values will be graded according t o the NCI-CTCAE version 4.
On-study weight and ECOG performance status should be assessed at each on-study visit prior to 
nivolumab dosing. On treatment vital signs may be performed wit hin 72 hours pri or to dose. In 
addition, vital signs can also be taken as per institutional st andard of care prior to; during and after 
the infusion. The start and stop time of the nivolumab infusion  should be documented. Physical 
examinations are to be performed at treatment visits as clinically indicated. If there are any new or 
worsening clinically significant changes since the last exam, r eport changes on the appropriate

Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory te sts, should be performed as 
clinically indicate d or to comply with local regulations. Labor atory toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
inducted liver enzyme elevations) will be monitored during the follow-up phase v ia on si te/local 
labs until all study drug related toxicities resolve, return to  baseline or are deemed irreversible.
Some of the previously referred to assessments may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They are 
intended to be used as safety monitoring by the treating physic ian. Additional testing or

regulations.
5.4 Efficacy Assessments
5.4.1 Imaging Assessments for the Study
Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that ar e not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by t he Study Investigator as per 
standard medical/clinical judgment.
Study evaluations will take place in accordance with the flow c harts in Section 5.1, Table 5.4.1-1 , 
Table 5.4.1-2 , and Appendix 3 . For the Neoadjuvant cohort, any images obtained prior to Month 4 
as standard of care should also be assessed.In addition to chest, abdomen, and pelvis, all known sites of d isease should be assessed at baseline. 
Subsequent assessments should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and all known sites of disease 
and should use the same imaging method as was  used at baseline.  Baseline MRI for brain should 
be done for known or suspected disease.

For the Metastatic Cohorts (monotherapy and combination therapy ), baseline tumor assessments 
should be performed within 35 days prior to the first dose. Subj ects will then be evaluated for 
tumor response beginning 8 week s from the d ate of first dose ( ±1 wk.), then every 8 weeks 
(±1 wk.) thereafter up to 48 weeks, then it will be every 12 weeks  (±2 weeks) until disease 
progression is documented, or when t reatment is disc ontinued (whichever occurs later). 
For the Neoadjuvant Cohort, a Day 29 tumor scan is required for w ithin 7 days prior to the planned 
surgery date. 
For Neoadjuvant Cohort subjects who progress to unresectable re current or metastatic disease 
within 1 year of surgical resection or chemotherapy/radiation an d receive nivolumab, a baseline 
tumor scan documenting progression is required prior to restarti ng nivolumab. Subjects will then 
be evaluated for tumor response beginning 8 weeks from the date of first dose of treatment 
(±1 wk.), then every 8 weeks ( ±1 wk.) thereafter up to 48 weeks, then it will be every 12 weeks  
(±2 week) until disease progression is documented, or when treatme nt is discontinued, (whichever

5.4.2 Primary Efficacy Assessment
The investigator objective response r ate (ORR) of nivolumab monotherapy is the pr imary endpoint 
among all tr eated sub jects in the recurrent/metastatic monotherapy cohort. The invest igator 
objective response rate (ORR) of nivolumab combination therapy (i pilimumab, BMS-986016, 
daratumumab) is the primary e ndpoint among all treated subjects i n the recurrent/metastatic 
combination cohort for combinati on therapies, Combo A, B, C and D.
ORR is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall re sponse (BOR) of confirmed 
complete response (CR) or par tial res ponse (PR) divided by the number of all tr eated subjects. 
BOR is defined as the best response designation recorded betwee n the date of first dose and the 
date of the initial objectively documented tumor progression per investigator assessment using 
RECIST 1.1 criteria or the date of subsequent therapy, whicheve r occurs first.

(relatlimab) combination cohorts are relative to the start of n ivolumab infusion. In the 
nivolumab/daratumumab combination cohort, daratumumab will be a dministered after nivolumab 
and predose sample for daratumumab should be drawn with a windo w of -2 hours before the start 
of daratumumab dosing. Daratumumab post-dose samples should be drawn within 2 hours after 
the end of the infusion. All on-tr eatment PK time points are intended to align with days on which 
nivolumab is administered. If it is known that a dose is going to be delayed, then the predose 
sample should be co llected just prior to the delayed dose. However, if a predose sa mple is 
collected, but the dose is subsequently delayed, an additional p redose sample should not be 
collected. 
The exact dates and times of blood sampling must be recorded. R efer to the Laboratory Manual 
for sample collection requir ements. Collected samples must be stored under the specified an d 
controlled conditions for the temperatures indicated in the Lab oratory Manual. Additional 
information about the co llection, handling, and shipment of biological samples can be f ound in the

5.6.1 Determination of Tumor’s Viral Positivity
Confirmation of viral status will be required prior to study drug assignment for EBV gastric cancer 
and HPV SCCHN tumor types in the metastatic cohorts. Confirmati on of viral status will also be 
required prior to st udy drug assignment for SCCHN sub jects enrolled in the neoadjuvant cohort
and Metastatic Combination Cohorts A and C. For SCCHN subjects in  Cohort D and in all other 
tumor types, viral status w ill not be required pri or to sub ject enro llment, but will be determined 
retrospectively if the viral status is not already known. Viral testing determined more than 35 days 
prior to first dose may be used. Viral status w ill be d etermined using an appropriately validated 
test as described below for each of the tumor types.
EBV Gastric:  In situ hybridization EBV RNA (EBER) of FFPE sect ions. Testing for EBV 
positivity will be performed prior to study drug assignment usi ng the EBER1 DNP probe from 
Ventana in a properly certified lab. Samples interpreted as (+)  if nuclear staining of any intensity 
above the background in tumor cells, provided the negative internal controls (adjacent normal 
tissue) are negative.
HPV Head and Neck:  HPV p- 16 status should be assessed using the following criteria: p16 IHC 
should be done with anti-p16INK4a clone E6H4 from MTM labs (Roc he). Interpretation as 
positive if > 70% strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic stai ning is specific to tumor cells; p-
16 status will be reported as either p-16 positive or p-16 nega tive. If results acquired according to 
these criteria are not available, then a sample (tissue on micr oscopic slides, tissue block or a fresh 
tissue biopsy in formalin) should be sent to sponsor-contracted  laboratory for analysis. HPV 16 in 
situ hybridization may also be performed retrospectively.  
Polyomavirus MCC:  Assessment of polyomavirus by IHC will be performed retrospectively at a 
sponsor-contracted laboratory if the polyomavirus status is unk nown. If the polyomavirus status is 
known, please report this information on the provided case report form.Cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal canal and penile: HPV positivity  is defined by FDA approved tests 
(Cobas HPV Test; Digene Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA Test; Cervista™ HPV HR and 
Genfind™ DNA Extraction Kit; Cervista™ HPV 16/18; APTIMA® HPV A ssay) or other well 
validated commercially available tests (such as Ventana Inform H PV ISH test) comprising in situ 
hybridization, real-time PCR, or immunohistochemistry (IHC). Hi gh-risk HPV positivity includes 
the following subtypes:  16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56 , 58, 59, 66, and 68. Virus  testing will 
be performed retrospectively only if results from prior accepte d testing are not available. If the 
HPV status is known please report this information on the provided case report form. 
EBV Nasopharyngeal: In situ hybrid ization EBV RNA (EBER) of FFPE s ections. Testing for EBV 
positivity will be performed using the EBER1 DNP probe from Ven tana in a properly certified 
lab. Samples interpreted as (+) if nuclear staining of any inte nsity above the background in tumor 
cells, provided the negative internal controls (adjacent normal  tissue) are negative.
Soluble Biomarkers: Soluble factors, such as cytokines, chemoki nes, soluble receptors, and 
antibodies to tumor antigens may be characterized and quantified  by immunoassays in serum. 
Analyses may include, but not necessarily be limited to, solubl e CD25, soluble PD-1, soluble

antigen-specific respons es elicited f ollowing tr eatment with monotherapy to explore which 
antitumor antibodies are most a ssociated with clinical re sponse. Antibody levels to cancer test 
antigens will be assessed by multiplex assays and enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
5.6.2 Viral-related Assessments
Quantification of EBV DNA by PCR, when a ppropriate, to correlate viral load to response. MHC 
tetramers assay may be used for analysis of virus-specific T cells. The seropositivity to viral 
oncoprotein antibodies and anti-viral antibodies may be examine d in serum samples. PBMCs
and/or lymphocytes isolated from tumors may be used in ELISPOT assays for T cell responses to 
viral antigens and/or epitope spreading.   
5.6.3 HLA Genotyping
HLA typing of peripheral  blood samples may b e assessed by standard genotyping methods.
5.6.4 Immunophenotyping
The proporti on of sp ecific lymphocyte subsets and expression levels of T cell co-st imulatory and 
inhibitory markers in peripheral blood m ononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations may be quantified 
by cytometry. Analyses may include, but not necessarily be limi ted to, the proportion of T, B, and 
NK cells, proportion of memory and effector T cell subsets, and  expression levels of PD-1, PD-L1, 
PD-L2, ICOS, and Ki67. Whole blood samples will also be collect ed to quantify myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells (MDSC) befo re and after treatment.  
5.6.5 Ex Vivo Functional AssaysTo explore whether nivolumab may restore T cell activation and function, peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated and cryopreserved. A ssays of the functional status of 
effector T cells may be performe d, including but not limited to, assays for interferon-gamma 
(IFN-ϒ) and CD107. 
5.6.6 Peripheral Blood Gene ExpressionThe expression level of genes and miRNA related to response to nivolumab as monotherapy or in 
combination with eithe r ipilimumab, BMS-986016 (relat limab), or daratumumab will be 
quantified by molecular methods such as nanostring, RNAseq, mic roarray, and/or quantitative 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analys is of whole blood samples. 
Analysis may include, but not necessarily be limited to, genes associated with immune-related 
pathways, such as T cell activation and antigen processing and presentation.
5.6.7 T Cell Repertoire Analysis
Low diversity of the periphera l T cell compartment has been sho wn to correlate with poor overall 
survival in metastatic breast cancer.
187A standing theory in immuno- oncology suggests a diverse 
and activated immune environment is better adept at eradicating  tumor compared to a skewed 
repertoire of naïve and tolerized T cells. In order to explore whether a diverse T cell repertoire is 
predictive of response to therapy, next generation, high-throug hput, DNA sequencing maybe

5.6.8 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Analysis
In order to identify potential polymorphisms associated with sa fety and efficacy of nivolumab, 
selected genes may be evaluated for single nucleotide polymorphi sms (SNP). Analysis may 
include but will not be limited to sequence polymorphisms linke d to genes associated with the 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and activated  T cell phenotype,  including PD -1, PD-L1, PD-L2, and 
CTLA-4. A blood sample will be ob tained at Day 1, unless restri cted by local regulations.
5.6.9 Tumor Samples
Tumor tissue specimen requirements for the Neoadjuvant Cohort are as follows:
•At Baseline (Prior to first dose of study drug): Biopsy and sub mission of fresh tumor tissue is 
mandatory for all sub jects. Biopsy is indicated for subjects with accessible lesions  where 
biopsy is deemed safe by the Investigator.
•Day 29 (On-treatment) fresh samples obtained via scheduled surg ical resection or scheduled 
biopsy are mandatory. 
•Day 29 (On-treatment) samples must be reviewed by pathologist a nd a copy of the pathology 
report must be sent to BMS
•All other time points where tum or tissue collections are indicated, aside from baseline and Day 
29, are described in Table 5.6.9-1 . 
Tumor tissue specimen requirements for the Metastatic Cohort (Mo notherapy and 
Combination Therapy) are as follows:•At Baseline (Prior to first dose of study drug): Biopsy and subm ission of fresh tumor tissue, or
submission of archived tumor tissue, is mandatory for all subjec ts. Biopsy is indicated for 
subjects with accessible lesions where biopsy is deemed safe by the Investigator. 
•An on-treatment biops y and submission of fresh tumor tissue is mandatory for subjects in each 
tumor type in the metastatic cohort to ensure an adequ ate number of paired samples to perform 
meaningful analyses t o support biomarker object ives. Subjects w ith accessible lesions where 
biopsy is deemed safe by the Investigator should undergo biopsy  per protocol.
•All other time points where tumor tissue collections are indicate d, aside from baseline and the 
one mandatory on-treatment biopsy, are described in Table 5.6.9-2 andTable 5.6.9-3.
Tumor tissue specimen requirements for Subjects Treated with Study Drug Post-Standard 
of Care are as follows:
•At Cycle 1 Day 1 biopsy and submission of fresh tumor tissue is  strongly encouraged for 
subjects with accessible lesions where biopsy is deemed safe by  the Investigator.
•All other time points where tum or tissue collections are ind icated, aside from Cycle 1 Day 1, 
are described in Table 5.6.9-4 .

Submission of fresh tumor tissue collected via biopsy is requir ed for TILs isolation for ex-vivo 
functional assays (RPMI media preparation), and also for gene e xpression profiling (RNALater 
samples). Please refer to Central Lab Manual for detailed sample requirements.
Submission of tissue samples (FFPE tumor tissue block or slides) is required for characterization 
of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tum or, ut ilizing immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
methods. A minimum of 1 FFPE tumor tissue block (preferred) OR minimum of 15 FFPE 
unstained sections are required for this purpose. Tissue for thi s purpose may be obtained during 
the screening phase, prior to resection, or collected as a stan dard of care procedure within 90 days 
prior to obtaining informed consent, and is mandatory. Please re fer to Central Lab Manual for 
detailed sample requirements.
Tissue for protocol purposes should be obtained via excision, i ncision or core needle. Fine needle 
aspirates are prohibited.Tumor samples obtained from bone metastases are not considered acceptable for PD-L1 testing 
because the PD-L1 assay does not include a decalcification step . For any cases where the only 
tumor tissue available is from a bone metastasis lesion, please discuss further with the study 
Medical Monitor.
All subjects may volunteer to undergo tumor biopsies at any tim e during therapy, if clinically 
indicated. When tumor biopsy is performed during these times, su bmission of tumor biopsy is 
strongly encouraged.
All tumor tissue sample submission upon progression is optional, and can be taken within 7 days 
at the discretion of the investigator.Tumor-Based Biomarker Measures
Tumor biopsy specimens will be obtained from consenting subject s prior to administration of study 
drug to characterize immune cell populations and e xpression of s elected tumor marke rs. Tumor 
biopsy collection and submission is mandatory for subjects with  accessible lesions prior to therapy. 
Tumor tissue (obtained during the screening phase or collected as a standard of care procedure 
within 90 days prior to obtaining informed consent) w ill be provided for biomarker analysis if 
accessible and deemed safe by the investigator. For subjects where tumor tissue ca nnot be provided
due to issues related to safety, the reason must be clearly docu mented in the medical record AND 
the BMS Medical Monitor must b e contacted. Arch ival tissue shoul d be submitted for these 
subjects. Submission of archival tissue is also encouraged for a ll subjects, irrespective of whether 
fresh biopsy tissue is available. 
For cases when a complete response occurs, and an on-tr eatment biopsy is required but not 
feasible, these cases must be clearly documented in the medical record AND the BMS Medical 
Monitor must be contacted.
A tumor biopsy sample of subjects that have confirmed progressi on is optional, but strongly 
encouraged for the purposes of understanding mechanisms of resi stance to therapy. 
Biopsy samples may be used for the following assessments:

Characterization of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and t umor. Immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) will be used to assess th e number and com position of immu ne infiltrates in order to define 
the immune cell subsets present within form alin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue 
before and after exposure to therapy. These IHC analyses may in clude, but not necessarily be 
limited to, the following markers: PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, LAG3, ID O, GITR, T cell and 
macrophage markers. For the neo-ad juvant arm only TILs may also  be assessed in fresh baseline 
biopsies and surgical resections by cytometry. Analysis of cytok ines including but not limited to 
IFN-g, IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, IL-17, and IL-32g may be done with multiplex qRT-PCR and/or 
amplified in situ hybridization (ISH) using fixed tumor tissue. 
Tumor genotyping, mutational analysis, and tumor antigen profil ing
RNA and DNA from tumor samples may be analyzed using whole-exome and transcriptome 
sequencing or another technology to determine the number of mut ations found within a given 
sample relative to a normal host tissue, such as adj acent non-transformed  cells or PBMC. 
Mutations that are detected w ill be analyzed for their ability to bind the MHC I and MHC II 
proteins using prediction algorithms. Evaluating the ab ility of tumor mutations to bind MHC 
molecules will provide evidence that these mutations are serving as antigens that are recognized 
the immune system and are potential rejection antigens. 
In addition to viral positivity, chromosomal translocations, abe rrant expressions, and epigenetic 
modifications within tumor cells may be characterized and explored by IHC and RNA/DNA 
analysis of tumor biopsies. Associations of altered tumor cell genetic structure with nivolumab 
efficacy will be performed. This includes, but is not limited to , assessments of 9p24 copy number 
alterations.Characterization of T cell repertoire . As described above, DNA sequencing may be performed 
on pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue to assess the composition  of the T cell re pertoire. DNA 
may be isolated from either the FFPE tumor block or from RNAlater, or equivalent preparations.  Gene expression profiling . Tumor biopsies that are collected in RNAlater or equivalent fixative 
maybe examined for mRNA and miRNA gene expression by nanostring , RNAseq, microarray, 
and/or quantitative real-time polymerase chain r eaction (qP CR) to detect e xpression o f selected 
immune related genes and regulatory pathways.Ex vivo Functional Assays. To explore whether nivolumab may restore T cell activation and 
function, Tumor infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) w ill be isolated. Assays for phenotypic 
characteristic as well as functi onal status of effector T cells  may be performed, including but not 
limited to, flow cytometry a nd peptide re stimulation.

5.7 Outcomes Research Assessments
The evaluation of hearth-related quality of life is an increasi ngly important aspect of clinical 
efficacy in oncology trials. Such data provides an understandin g of the impact of treatment from 
the participant’s perspective and offer insights into patient e xperience that may not be captured 
through physician reporting. Additionally, generic health-relat ed quality of life measures provide 
data needed for calculati ng utility values to inform health economic models.
The 3-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) will be used to ass ess treatment effects on perceived 
health s tatus and to generate ut ility data for health ec onomic evaluations. The EQ-5D-3L is a 
generic multi-attribute health-state classification system by w hich health is described in 5 
dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomf ort, and anxiety/depression. Each 
dimension is evaluated using 3 levels: no problems, some proble ms, and extreme problems. 
Responses to these 5 dimensions are converted into 1 of 243 uni que health state descriptions, which 
range between no problems in all 5 dimensions (11111) to extrem e problems in all 5 dimensions 
(33333). Using appropriate country-specific value weighting alg orithms, a respondent’s self-
described health state can be converted into a utility represen ting the societal desirability of his or 
her own health. In addition, the EQ-5D includes a visual analogue scale (VAS) allowing a 
respondent to rate his/her h ealth on a s cale ranging from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst h ealth 
state imaginable and 100 being the best health state imaginable . 
The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Can cer (EORTC) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire–Core 30 (QLQ-C30) w ill be used to assess the eff ects of disease symptoms on 
functioning and well-being. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is the most commo nly used quality of life 
instrument in oncology trials. The instrument’s 30 items are divided among five functional scales 
(physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), eight sympt om scales (fatigue, pain, 
nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation , and diarrhea), a scale measuring 
financial difficulties, and a global h ealth or quality of life scale. With the exception of two items 
included in the global health or quality of life scale, for whi ch responses range from 1 (Very poor) 
to 7 (Excellent), item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very muc h). Raw scores for the 
QLQ-C30 and are transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher v alues indicate better functioning 
or QoL or a higher level of symptoms.
5.8 Immunogenicity Assessments
Serum samples collected at time points identified from Table 5.5-1 toTable 5.5-8 will be analyzed 
by validated immunoassay methods. Additional characterization (ie , neutralizing antibodies) for 
any detected anti-drug anti bodies (ADA) response to st udy drug may also be performed. All 
samples collected for detection of anti-drug antibodies will al so be assessed for the respective 
serum drug concentrations to enable interpretation of the antib ody data. All on-treatment PK time 
points are intended to align with days on which nivolumab is admin istered. If it is known that a 
dose is going to be delayed, then the predose sample should be collected just prior to the delayed 
dose. However, if a predose s ample is co llected, but the dose is  subsequently delayed, an additional 
predose sample should not be co llected. Selected serum samples m ay be analyzed by an 
exploratory method that measures anti-nivolumab, anti-ipilimumab , anti-BMS-986016

(relatlimab), or anti-daratumumab antibodies for technology expl oration purposes; exploratory 
results will not be reported.
In addition, serum samples designated for PK or biomarker asses sments may also be used for
immunogenicity analysis if required (eg, if there is insufficie nt volume for complete
immunogenicity assessment or to follow up on suspected immunoge nicity related AE).
6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subjec t administered study drug and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treat ment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an  abnormal la boratory f inding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or no t considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physic ian and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE).The cau sal relationship can be one of the f ollowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and 
the AE.Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug 
administration and the AE.
The term “reasonable causal relati onship” means there is evidenc e to suggest a causal relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs .)
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject wa s at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically m ight have caused death if it were 
more severe)
•requires inpatient  hospitalization or cause s prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see NOTE
below)
•results in persisten t or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the  definition above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in

hospitalization.) Potential dr ug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study d rug 
is an SAE.
Although p regnancy, overdose, cancer, and po tential drug induced liver in jury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAE s, (See S ection 6.1.1
for reportin g pregnancies).
Any compo nent of a study endpoint that is considered related to study th erapy (eg, death is an 
endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported ) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE : 
The followi ng hospitalizations are not considere d SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
−a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in ad mission (unless considered an important medical or life-threate ning event)
−elect ive surgery, planned prior to signing consent
−admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
−routine h ealth assessment requi ring admission for baseline/trending of h ealth status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
−medical/surgical admission other than t o remedy ill health and planne d prior to entry into 
the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
−admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries  no bearing on health status 
and requires no medical/surgical in tervention (eg, lack of hous ing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).
−Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absen ce of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 a nd 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) repr esent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting. 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the s tudy, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study drug, must be collected, including those thoug ht to be associated with protocol-
specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within
100 days of the last dose of study drug. For participants assigned to treatment and never treated 
with study drug, SAEs should be collected for 30 days from the d ate of treatment assignment. If 
applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later pro tocol-specified procedure (eg, a 
follow-up skin biopsy). 
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these t ime periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.

An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exi sts regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to stud y drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrati ve section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not  related to study d rug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS 
(or designee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs mus t be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregna ncy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting co llection is t hrough the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance  forms are only intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is  not functioning. 
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or  confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC) , electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used a nd submitted immediately, only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmiss ion. When paper forms are used, the 
original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact
Information list.
If only limited information is  initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initia lly reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to s tudy drug or if n ew information 
becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the ini tial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious A E information should begin at ini tiation of study drug. Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a pla cebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status fo r the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuati on of study drug and for those pres ent at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic).

Immune-mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immun e-mediated mechanism or 
immune-mediated component for which non-inflammatory etiologies  (eg, infection or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with  an alternate etiology which were 
exacerbated by the induction of autoimmunity. I nformation suppo rting the assessment will be 
collected on the participant’s case report form.
All non-serious adverse events  (not only those deemed to be tre atment-related) shoul d be co llected 
continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of 10 0 days following the last dose 
of study treatment.Every adverse event must be assessed by the investigator with r egard to whether it is considered 
immune-mediated. For events which  are potentially immune-mediat ed, additional information will 
be collected on the subject’s case report form.
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or  laboratory abnormalities that 
are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory test  result abnormalities  should be ca ptured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper  or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the sub ject to r eceive specific corrective 
therapy.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value) .
6.4 PregnancyIf, following initiation of the study drug, it is subsequently discovered that a study sub ject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure , including during at least 
approximately 5 half-lives after produc t administration plus 30 d ays, the investigator must 
immediately notify the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form to BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in 
accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Section 6.1.1 .
In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose 
tapering if necessary for subject safety).
In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk, after 
consultation with BMS, the pregnant subject may continue study drug after a thorough discussion 
of benefits and risk with the subject
The investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or designee) Medical Monit or of this event 
and complete and forward a Pre gnancy Surveillance Form to BMS ( or designee) w ithin 24 hours

of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in 
Section 6.1.1 . 
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a fem ale partner of a male study parti cipant should be  reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy  will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
All occurrences of overdose must be reported as SAEs (see Sect ion 6.1.1 for re porting details).
6.6 Potential Drug Induc ed Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confirma tion of initial liver-relat ed laboratory abnormalities s hould 
occur prior to the reporting of a pote ntial DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting 
the defined criteria, must be reported  as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury is  defined as: 
1.AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 t imes upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND
2.Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, w ithout initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline  
phosphatase),
AND
3.No other immediately apparent p ossible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, vira l hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or th e 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physica l examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or  not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

1) Neoadjuvant cohort:
The SCCHN tumor types will contain 21 HPV-positive and 21 HPV-n egative evaluable subjects. 
MCC and cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancers tumor types will c ontain 21 evaluable subjects each. 
A sample size of 21 can detect, with more than 66% and 89% prob ability, a safety event that occurs 
at an incident rate of 5% and 10%, respectively. Assuming 10%, 15%, and 20% for pathologic 
complete respons e rate, a sample size of 21 can detect more than 89%, 97% and 99% probability, 
at least one pathol ogic complete response respectively.
2) Recurrent/m etastatic monotherapy cohort:
HPV+ SCCHN, G YN, MCC and NPC tumor types in the recurrent/metastatic cohort w ill contain 
approximately 23 subjects. Table 8.1-1 shows the probabilities of observing 0, 1 or  2 responders 
and ≥3 responders assuming 5%, 20% and 30% true response rate of ORR. Table 8.1- 2 shows the 
two-sided 95% exact CI using Clopper-Pearson methods based on observed 3, 4 and  5 responders 
out of 23 subjects.
EBV+ Gastric tumor type will contain approximately 12 subjects,  due to the low prevalence. Table

Each dosing schema will contain approximately 40 subjects. With R evised Protocol 06, no new 
subjects will be randomized in the anogenital HPV associ ated tumors cohorts.
Additionally, the metastatic cervical Combination B cohort w ill be expanded to treat
approximately 50 subjects as first-line treatment for their rec urrent/metastatic disease if unfit or 
unsuitable to receive platinum-based therapy and approximately 20 subjects as second-line
treatment for their recurrent/metastatic SCC of the cervix to con firm the efficacy signal. With 
Combo B and the Combo B expansion, there should be a total of a pproximately 75 subjects with 
first-line treatment and approximately 35 subjects with second-l ine treatment of cervical cancer
(approximately 110 cervical subjects total). 
The HPV+ SCCHN with prior PD-1/PD-L1 treatment tum or type will be e nrolled in Metastatic 
Combination Cohort (Combo C). Combo C w ill contai n approximately 40 subjects. However, at 
Revised Protocol 05, no new subjects will be enrolled in this cohort.Approximately 40 HPV negative and HPV indeterminate I-O naive S CCHN subjects will be 
enrolled to the Combo D tr eatment arm. With Revised Protocol 06, no new subjects w ill be 
enrolled in this cohort.
Sample sizes of each treatment arm in each tumor type are summarized in Table 8.1-3 .
An ORR in excess of 10% will be considered of clinical interest. Assuming the true ORR is 25%, 
40 subjects in each tumor type  can provide approximately 79.8% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the true ORR is  10%, considering a 2-sided alpha of 5%. In addition Table 8.1-4
shows the precision of the estimation of ORR based on the two sided 95% exact CI using Clopper-Pearson methods based on 8, 9, 12, 16 and 20 responders out of 40 subjects. At observed more 
than or equal to 9 responders, ie, ORR ≥22.5%, the lower bound of the 95% CI excludes 10%.
Table 8.1-5 shows the precision of the est imation of ORR ba sed on the two s ided 95% exact CI 
using Clopper-Pearson methods based on 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 responder s out of 12 subjects. Assuming 
the true ORR is 25%, 12 subjects can provide approximately 84% probability to observe at least 2 responders.
Table 8.1-6 shows the precision of the est imation of ORR ba sed on the two s ided 95% exact CI 
using Clopper-Pearson methods based on 20, 22, 26, 30, 33, and 35 responders out of 50 subjects. 
At observed more than or equal to 22 responders, ie, ORR ≥44%, the lower bound of the 95% CI 
excludes 30%; at observed more than or equal to 26 responders, ie, ORR ≥52%, the lower bound 
of the 95% CI excludes 37%.
Table 8.1-7 shows the precision of the est imation of ORR ba sed on the two s ided 95% exact CI 
using Clopper-Pearson methods based on 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 and 14 re sponders out of 35 subjects. At 
observed more than or equal to 8 responders, ie, ORR ≥22.9%, the lower bound of the 95% CI 
excludes 10%.Due to the low prevalence of EBV+ Gastric tumor types and the c urrent investigation of this tumor 
type in other BMS-sponsored studies, combination cohorts in thi s study will no longer include 
EBV+ Gastric tumor type.

8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
Neoadjuvant cohort : 
•The safety and tolerability objective will be measured by the i ncidence of drug-related  select 
AEs and drug-related SAEs.
•Rate of surgery delay, which is defined as the proportion of sub jects in the neoadjuvant cohort 
with surgery delayed > 4 weeks from the planned surgery date or  planned start date for 
chemoradiation due to a drug-related AE will be reported for ea ch tumor type.
Metastatic cohorts (monotherapy and combination therapies) : 
•The investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR). ORR is  defined as the number of 
subjects with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed comple te response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) divided by the number of treated subjects. BOR is  defined as the best response 
designation recorded between the date of first dose and the dat e of the initial objectively 
documented tumor progression per investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 criteria or the 
date of the last tumor assessment date prior to subsequent ther apy. In this study, an ORR in 
excess of 10% will be considered of clinical interest, and an O RR of 25% or greater w ill be 
considered of strong clinical interest.  
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
Metastatic cohorts (monotherapy and combination therapies) :
•Durati on of res ponse (DOR) is defined as the time from first confirmed response (CR or PR) 
to the date of the initial objectively documented tumor progres sion as determined per 
investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs 
first. Subjects who did not start subsequent anti-cancer therap y and die without a reported prior 
progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not progress or die w ill be censore d on the date of their last tumor assessment. Subjects who 
did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on the date they were treated. Subjects who started any subsequent anti-cancer t herapy prior to death and 
without a prior reported progression will be censored at the las t tumor assessm ent prior to or 
on the date of initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy . DOR will only be  evaluated in 
subjects with  objective res ponse of CR or PR.
•Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time  from first dosing date to the d ate of death. A subject 
who has not died will be censored at last known date alive. 
•Investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) is define d as the time from first dosing 
date to the date of the first documented tumor progression, as determined by investigators (per

therapy and die without a reported prior progression will be co nsidered to have progressed on 
the date of their death. Subjects who did not progress or die wi ll be censored on the date of 
their last tumor assessment. Subjects who did not have any on s tudy tumor assessments and 
did not die will be censored on the date they were treated. Sub jects who started any subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy prior to death and without a prior reported  progression will be censored at 
the last tumor assessment prior to or on the date of initiation  of the subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy.
8.3.3 Exploratory Endpoint(s)
Neoadjuvant cohort: 
•The percent change from baseline of select immune cells and the  percent change from baseline 
of select immune activation/inhibitory molecules of viral-speci fic T cells in tumor specific 
subsets of nivolumab treated subjects will be evaluated.
•Recurrence-free survival (RFS), which is defined as the time fr om surgery to the date or 
recurrence(local, regional, metastasis, locally advanced unrese ctable recurrence, clinical or 
radiographic progression occurs after surgery) as determined by investigators, or death due to 
any cause, whichever occurs first. (Note: a subject who dies wi thout reported recurrence will 
be considered to have recurred on the date of death.) For subjects who remain alive and whose 
disease has not recurred, RFS will be censored on the date of last evaluable disease assessment. 
Participants who did not have any post-surgery disease assessme nts and did not die will be 
censored on the surgery date. Further d etails on the censoring rules for consideration of 
subsequent therapies, will be described in the Statistical Anal ysis Plan (SAP).
•The proportion of treated subjects who experiences pathologic complete response will be used 
to determine pathologic response rate of tumors after two doses  of neoadjuvant nivolumab in 
HPV positive and negative SCCHN, resectable Merkel Cell Carcinoma, and cervical, vaginal, 
or vulvar cancer. Pathological complete response (pCR) is defin ed as the absence of residual 
viable invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of th e complete resected tumor
specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion o f neoadjuvant sys temic 
therapy.
Metastatic cohorts (monotherapy and combination therapies):
•The safety and tole rability objective w ill be measured by the incidence of adverse events, 
serious adverse events, deaths and laboratory  abnormalities.
•Pre- and post-treatment EBV DNA lev els will be collected in the subjects with EBV positive 
gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The change in EBV DNA levels will be used to 
determine the effect of BMS-936558 (nivolumab). (Monotherapy coh ort only)

analyses for each metastatic cohort (nivolumab monotherapy or c ombo A, B, C, or D) will be 
performed as it completes efficacy follow-up. All analyses will be performed independently by 
cohort, by tumor type, and regimen.
The randomization of the patients with m etastatic cervical cancer a nd anogenital HPV associated

presented using NCI CTCAE version 4. All on-study AEs, drug-rel ated, AEs, SAEs and 
drug-related SAEs will be tabulated  using worst grade per NCI C TCAE version 4 criteria by 
system organ class and MedDRA preferred term. On-study lab para meters including hematology, 
chemistry, liver function, thyroid function, and renal function  will be summarized using worst 
grade per NCI CTCAE version 4 criteria.
The proportion of subjects in the neoadjuvant cohort with surge ry delayed > 4 weeks due to a drug-
related AE will be re ported for each tumor type and the Clopper-Pearson method w ill be used to 
estimate the two-sided 95% confidence interval.
8.4.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The nivolumab, ipilimumab, BMS-986016 (relatlimab), and daratumu mab concentration data 
obtained in this study may  be combined with data from other studies in any of the clinical 
development programs (nivolumab, ipilimumab, BMS-986016, and da ratumumab) to develop or 
refine a population PK model. The models may be used to evaluate  the effects of intrinsic and 
extrinsic covariates on the PK of nivolumab or other compounds a nd to determine measures of 
individual exposure (such as steady-state peak, trough, and time -averaged concentration). In 
addition, model determined exposur es may be used for exposure-re sponse analyses. If performed, 
results of population PK and exposure response-analyses will be reported separately.
8.4.5 Biomarker Analyses
The pharmacodynamic effects of nivolumab as monotherapy or in co mbination with ip ilimumab,
BMS-986016 (re latlimab) , or daratumumab on selected biomarkers will be assessed by summ ary 
statistics and corresponding cha nges (or percen t changes) from baseline tabu lated by time and 
cohort. In addition, th e time course of biomarker outcomes will be investigated graphically, by 
summary plots or individual subject plots. If there is an indic ation of a meaningful 
pharmacodynamic trend, methods such as linear mixed models may be used to characterize the 
pattern of change over time. The potential association between PD-L1 expression level (IHC) and 
clinical efficacy measures will be assessed using Fisher’s exac t test or other methodology as

9 STUDY MANAGEMENT
9.1 Compliance
9.1.1 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions
The study shall be conducted as described in this approved prot ocol. All revisions to the protocol 
must be discussed with, and be prepared by, BMS. The investigat or should not implement any 
deviation or change to the protocol without prior review and do cumented approval/favorable 
opinion from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to study subjects. 
If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to elimin ate an immediate hazard(s) prior to 
obtaining IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion, as soon as possib le the deviation or change will be 
submitted to:
•IRB/IEC for review and approval/favorable opinion
•BMS
•Regulatory Authority(ies), if required by local regulations
Documentation of approval signed by the chairperson or designee  of the IRB(s)/IEC(s) must be 
sent to BMS.
If an amendment substantially a lters the study design or increa ses the potential risk to the subject: 
(1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s )/IEC(s) for review and 
approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised form must be used t o obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the ame ndment; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment.
If the revision is done via an a dministrative letter, investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
9.1.2 Monitoring
BMS representatives will review data centrally to identify pote ntial issues to determine a schedule 
of on-site visits for targeted review of study records. 
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study site locations periodically to assess the 
data quality and study integrity . On site they will review study records and directly compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the  investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable. Certain CRF pages and/or electron ic files may serve as the source 
documents.In addition, the study may be evaluated by BMS internal auditor s and government inspectors who 
must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other st udy f iles, and study  facilities . BMS 
audit reports will be kept confidential.The investigator must notify BMS promptly of a ny inspections scheduled by regulatory aut horities,
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to BMS.

9.1.2.1 Source Documentation
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and attr ibutable, whether the data ar e hand-written on paper or entered 
electronically. If source  data are created (first entered), modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electronically via computer ized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such s ystems must be compliant with all 
applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic rec ords and/or electronic signatures. 
Such systems may include, but are not limited to, electronic medical/health records (EMRs/EHRs), 
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol required assessments,  and/or drug accountability 
records).
When paper records from such systems are used in place of electronic format to perform regulated 
activities, such paper records should be certified copies. A ce rtified copy consists of a copy of 
original information that has been verified, as indicated by a dated signature, as an exact copy 
having all of the same attributes a nd information as the original. 
9.1.3 Investigational Site Training
Bristol-Myers Squibb will provide quality investig ational staff training prior to study initiation. 
Training topics will include but are not limited to: GCP, AE reporting, study details and procedure, 
electronic CRFs, study documen tation, informed consent, and enro llment of WOCBP.
9.2 Records
9.2.1 Records Retention
The investigator must retain all study rec ords and source doc uments for the maximum period 
required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or instituti on procedures, or for the period 
specified by BMS, whichever is longer. The investigator must co ntact BMS prior to destroying 
any records associated with the study.
BMS will notify the investigator when the study records are no longer needed.
If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation, r etirement), the records sh all be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (eg, another inv estigator, IRB). Notice of such 
transfer will be given in writing to BMS.
9.2.2 Study Drug Records
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that a c urrent disposition record of study drug 
(inventoried and dispensed) is maintained at the study site to i nclude investigational product. 
Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and should include:
•amount received and placed in storage area
•amount currently in storage area
•label identification number or b atch number 
•amount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including uni que subject identifiers
•amount transferred to another area/site for dispensing or storag e
•nonstudy disposition (eg, lost, wasted)

•dates and initials of person responsible for Investigational Pr oduct dispensing /accountability, 
as per the Delegation of Authority Form.
BMS will provide forms to facilitate inventory control if the investigational site does not have an 
established system that meets these requirements.
9.2.3 Case Report Forms
An investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate an d accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other d ata pertinent to the investig ation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and 
reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source document s or the dis crepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and  analyzed in an effort to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study.
For sites using the BMS electronic data capture tool, electroni c CRFs will be prepared for all data 
collection fields except for fields specific to SAEs and pregna ncy, which will be reported on the 
paper or electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, r espectively. Spaces may be left 
blank only in those circumstances permitted by study-specific C RF completion guidelines 
provide d by BMS. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable reg ulatory requirement(s).
The investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document si gnatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs. The completed CRF, including any paper or electronic SAE/pregnancy CRFs, must be promptly 
reviewed, signed, and dated by the investigator or qualified ph ysician who is a subinvestigator and 
who is delegated this task on the Delegation of Authority Form.  For electronic CRFs, review and 
approval/signature is completed electronically through the BMS electronic data capture tool. The 
investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of the changes and corrections.
Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet BMS training requirements and 
must only access the BMS electronic data capture tool using the  unique user account provided by 
BMS. User accounts are not to be shared or reassigned to other i ndividuals.

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete Abstinence If one form of contraception is required, Co mplete 
Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all 
study drugs. Female subjects must continue to have 
pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly 
effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
If two forms of contraception is required, Complete 
abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all 
study drugs. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are 
not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
Expanded definition Complete abstinence as defined as 
complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse is an 
acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. This
also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle  
of the patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sym ptothermal, profession of abstinence 
for entry into a clinical trial, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are 
not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abstinence

APPENDIX 3 RECIST 1.1 GUIDELINES
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized meas urable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dime nsion (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
1. 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm )
2. 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which can not be accurately measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
3. 20 mm by chest x-ray
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymp h 
node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thi ckness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet th e criterion of a short axis of 
≥15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The 
short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiolo gists to judge if a node is involved 
by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensio ns in the plane in which the 
image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagi ttal or coronal ). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For 
example, an abdominal node which  is reported as being 20 mm x 3 0 mm has a short axis of 
20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this exa mple, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm 
but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes tha t have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or follo wed.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including smal l lesions (longest diameter 
< 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable  include: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical 
exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.

2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) represen tative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and  measured at baseline (this means 
in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites in volved a maximum of two and 
four lesions respectively will be recorded).
Target lesions should be selecte d on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should b e those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on  occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short ax is for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum dia meters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis i s added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) includi ng pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Mea surements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to follow). In additi on, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involvi ng 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘m ultiple enlarged pelvic lymph 
nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 RESPONSE CRITERIA
3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nod es 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesio ns, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes th e baseline sum if that 
is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase  of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of 
one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient i ncrease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.

3.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
3.1.1.1 Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions s hould alway s have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nod es are included as target 
lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a 
normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  Case report forms or other data 
collection methods may therefore be designed t o have target nodal lesions recorded in a separate 
section where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achie ve a short axis < 10 mm. For PR, 
SD and PD, the actual short axi s measurement of the nodes is to  be included in the sum of target 
lesions.
3.1.1.2 Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline s hould have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as  target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel co mfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. Wh en this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the 
lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be record ed as 0 mm. If the lesion is 
believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to mea sure, a default value of 5 mm 
should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they 
usually have a definable size when normal and are freque ntly surrounded by fat such as in the 
retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be pre sent and is faintly seen but too 
small to measure, a default value of  5 mm s hould be assigned in this circumstance as well). This 
default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with 
varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions i s potentially non-reproducible, 
therefore providing this default v alue will prevent false respo nses or progressions based upon 
measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is  able to provide an actual measure, 
that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
3.1.1.3 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions should be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, a s lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diam eter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such tha t they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the m aximal longest di ameter for the 
‘coalesced lesion’.

3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to d etermine the tumor response for the 
group of non-target les ions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they 
need not be meas ured and instead  should be a ssessed only qualitatively at the time points 
specified in the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tu mor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10mm short 
axis). 
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintena nce of tumor 
marker level above t he normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see co mments below) of existing 
non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new le sions is also 
considered progression).
3.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non-Target Disease
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
3.2.1.1 When the patient also has measurable diseaseIn this setti ng, to achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the no n-target disease, there 
must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target  disease such that, even in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burde n has increased sufficiently to 
merit discontinuation of therapy (see examples in Appendix 2  and further details below). A 
modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions  is usually not sufficient to qualify 
for unequivocal progression status . The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of 
change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely 
rare.
3.2.1.2 When the patient has only non-measurable disease
This circumstance arises in some trials when it is not a criter i o n  o f  s t u d y  e n t r y  t o  h a v e  
measurable disease. The same general concepts apply here as not ed above, however, in this 
instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor in to the interpretation of an increase 
in non-measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non-targ et disease cannot be easily 
quantified (by definition: if all lesions are truly non-measura ble) a useful test that can be applied 
when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consi der if the increase in overall 
disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is  comparable in magnitude to the 
increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable di sease: ie, an increase in tumor 
burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% 
increase diameter i n a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion 
from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease fr om localized to widespread, or may 
be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in  therapy’. If ‘unequivocal 
progression’ is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While

it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-me asurable disease, the very nature of 
that disease makes it impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substantial.
3.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion; therefore, some 
comments on d etection of new lesions are  important. There are n o specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the findin g of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning te chnique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (f or example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing les ions). This is particularly 
important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or c omplete response. For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is 
not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease p rogression. An example of this is 
the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastase s are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new di sease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progressi on should be de clared using the date of the initial scan. 
While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is  sometimes reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanni ng in assessment of 
progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging 
can be identified according to the following al gorithm:
1. Negative FDG-PET at bas eline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.
2. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: I f the positive FDG-PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT,  this is PD. If the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up 
CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the 
date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET sca n). If the posit ive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on C T that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
3.3 Response Assessment
3.3.1 Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from th e start of the study treatment until 
the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for co nfirmation. The patient’s best 
overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both  target and non-target disease and

will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions . Furthermore, depending on the 
nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.
3.3.2 Time Point Response
It is assumed that at each protocol specified time point, a response assessment occurs. Ta ble 
3.3.2-1 provides a summary of the ove rall response status calcula tion at each time point for 
patients who have measurable disease at baseline. When patients  have non-measurable (therefore 
non-target) disease only, Table 3.3.2-2 is to be used.

3.3.3 Best Overall Response 
Best response determinati on of comp lete or partial response requires confirmation: Comp lete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point 
of ≥4 weeks later. In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in Table 
3.3.3-1.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum of target 
lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (< 10 mm), they  may still have a measurement 
reported on scans. This measurement should be recorded even tho ugh the nodes are normal in 
order not t o overstate progression s hould it be based on increase in s ize of the nodes. As noted 
earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report 
form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen  at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that poi nt (since disease must have reappeared after CR). 
Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD w as met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not 
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the orig inal CR should be changed to PR and the best 
response is PR.
bMinimum criteria for SD duration is 6 weeks.

3.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assigned a status of CR or PR, c hanges in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by consecutive repeat assessments that should  be performed no less than 
28 days after the criteria for response are first met. For this study, the next scheduled tumor 
assessment can meet this requirement.
Verification of Progression: Progressi on of dis ease should be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, then progression should be declared using the date of 
the initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the s ubject is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note:   Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review  of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in  a  w o m a n  over age 
45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological cau ses. In addition , females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulatin g hormone, (F SH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BE ARING 
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effective methods of contraception listed bel ow is required during study 
duration and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defin ed as 5 months after t he end of 
study treatment. 
Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/o r additional cont raception 
methods.

•Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pills containing a 
combination of estrogen and progesterone, vaginal ring, injecta bles, implants and 
intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)c
•Intrauterine device (IUD)c
•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
•Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
−It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence 
is elected. 
−WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue  to have 
pregnancy tests, as specified in Section 2 . 
−Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in 
the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive metho ds for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with t he study drug, which may r educe the efficacy of 
the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that the 
IMP and other study medications w ill not alter hormonal e xposures such that contraception would be ineffective 
or result in increased exposures that could be potentially haza rdous. In this case, alternative methods of 
contraception should be utilized.
cIntrauterine de vices and intrauterin e hormone releasing sys tems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug inter action studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness

APPENDIX 5 REVISED PROTOCOL SUMMARY OF CHANGE HISTORY
Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol 06, 18-Jul-2018
Rationale for Discontinuation of Nivolumab plus Daratumumab Combination Therapy
Adecision to temporary hold on further enrollment was made on 26 -May-2018 based on a 
communication that the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) of a Phase Ib/II study in non-small cell lung 
cancer of daratumumab in combination with atezolizumab (an anti  PD-L1 antibody from Roche) had 
recommended that study be terminated. The DMC of that study det ermined that there was no observed 
benefit within the combination arm of daratumumab plus atezoliz umab over atezoluzimab monotherapy 
and in addition to the lack of benefit, the DMC noted a numeric al increase in mortality-related events in 
the combination arm.
As such, BMS has decided to terminate the daratumumab arms in this study.
Rationale for Adding Cervical Cancer Cohort Expansion
The cervical cancer expansion cohort was added to further c onfirm the preliminary efficacy and 
safety signals of the combination B as first- or second-line tre atment for recurrent or metastatic 
SCC of the cervix.
Rationale for Moving Neoadjuvant Cohort from Secondary to Explo ratory Objective
This endpoint is primarily to explore the effect of treatment o n immune cells and immune 
regulatory markers and generate hypothesis for further validati on. Because it is measured to 
generate a hypothesis, is has been changed to an exploratory en dpoint.

Clinical Protocol CA209358
BMS-936558 nivolumab
Current clinical and safety data for both BMS-986016 (Anti-LAG3 ) and daratumumab now 
available are included. 
A 24-month maximum duration of ni volumab treatment has also bee n implemented in this 
Revised Protocol. The optimal duration of immunotherapy is an i mportant question and 
continues to be investigated. Clinical trials across different tumors types in the nivolumab and 
ipilimumab development program indicate that most of the respon ses occur early, with a median 
time to response of 2-4 months, and emerging data suggests that  benefit can be maintained in the 
absence of continue d treatment. A recent an alysis in a melanoma  study suggests the majority of 
patients who discontinue nivolumab and/or ipilimumab for toxici ty maintain disease control in 
the absence of further treatmen t. Furthermore,  a limited durati on of ipilimumab, including only 
four induction doses , resulted in long-term survival in patients with metastatic me lanoma, with a 
sustained plateau in survival s tarting around 2 y ears after the start of treatment.
Accumulating data suggest that 2 years of PD-1 checkpoint inhib itor treatment may be sufficient 
for long-term benefit. CA209003, a dose-escalati on cohort expans ion trial evaluating the safety 
and clinical activity of nivolumab in patients with previously treated advanced solid tumors 
(including 129 subjects with NS CLC), specified a maximum treatm ent duration of 2 years.  
Among 16 subjects with non-small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who d iscontinued nivolumab after 
completing 2 years of treatment, 12 subjects were alive >5 year s and remained progression-free 
without any subsequent therapy. In the CA209003 NSCLC cohort, t he overall survival (OS) 
curve begins to plateau after 2 years with an OS rate of 25% at 2 years and 18% at 3 years. These 
survival outcomes are similar to Phase 3 studies in previously treated NSCLC, in which 
nivolumab treatment was continued until progression or un acceptable toxicity (2-year OS rates 
of 23% and 29%, and 3-year OS rates of 16% to 18% for squamous and non-squamous NSCLC 
respectively).
Similar results have been reported in clinical studies of pembr olizumab, another PD-1 inhibitor. 
Keynote-010 was a randomized phase 3 trial of pembrolizumab (at  either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks) versus docetaxel in subjects with previously tre ated, PD-L1-positive, advanced 
NSCLC which specified a  maximum treatment duration of 2 years for pembrolizumab. OS was 
significantly longer with both pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (HR 0.72, p = 0.00017) and 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg (HR 0.60, p < 0.00001) compared to docetaxel, with an OS plateau 
developing beyond 2 years in both pembrolizumab arms. Among 690  patients who received 
pembrolizumab, 47 patients completed 2 years of pembrolizumab a nd stopped treatment. Most 
were able to maintain their response, including those with stab le disease, with only two patients 
(4%) having confirmed progression after stopping at 2 years. Keynote-006 was a randomized phase 3 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients 
with advanced melanoma, which also specified a maximum 2 year d uration of pembrolizumab 
treatment. 104 (19%) of 556 patients rando mized to pembrolizumab completed  2  y e a r s  o f  
treatment. With a median follow-up of 9 months after completion  of pembrolizumab, the 
estimated ris k of progression or death was 9% in these patients.

Taken together, these data suggest that treatment beyond 2 year s is unlikely to confer additional 
clinically meaningful benefit and that the risk of progression after discontinuing treatment at 2 
years is low.
In contrast, a shorter duration of nivolumab of only 1 year was  associated with increased risk of 
progression in previously tr eated patients with NSCLC, s uggesting that treatment be yond 1 year 
is likely needed. In CA209153, pati ents with previously treated  advanced NSCLC who 
completed 1 year of nivolumab therapy were randomized to either continue or stop treatment, 
with the option of retr eatment upon progression. Amo ng 163 patients still on t reatment at 1 year 
and without progression, those who were randomized to continue n ivolumab had significant 
improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to thos e who were randomized to stop 
treatment, with median PFS (post-randomization) not reached vs 10.3 months, respectively; 
HR=0.42 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.71). With a median follow-up of 14.9 months post-randomization, 
there also was a trend for patients on continued treatment to l ive longer (OS HR = 0.63 [95% CI: 
0.33, 1.20]). Of note,  the PFS curves in  both groups  plateau a pproximately 1 year after 
randomization (i.e., 2 years after tr eatment initiation), s uggesting that there may be minimal 
benefit in extending treatment beyond a total of 2 years.
Collectively, these data suggest that there is minimal if any benefit derived from continuing I-O 
treatment beyond two years in advanced tumors. However, even th ough immunotherapy is well 
tolerated, patients will be at risk for additional toxicity wit h longer-term treatm ent. Therefore, in 
this study, treatment will be gi ven for a maximum of 2 years fr om the start of study treatment.

Protocol Synopsis 
TITLE  
A Double-masked, Placebo-controlled Study with Open-label Perio d to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
MEDI-551 in Adult Subjects with Neuromyelitis Optica and Neurom yelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders    
HYPOTHESES 
The primary hypothesis for this study is that by depleting clus ter of differentiation (CD)19+ B cells including 
plasmablasts and plasma cells, MEDI-551 is effective in reducin g the risk of neuromyelitis 
optica/neuromyelitis optica- spectrum disorders (NMO/NMOSD) att ack compared to placebo, thus 
effectively reducing the risk of irreversible disability caused  by such attacks.  
Secondary Hypotheses:  
• Depletion of CD19+ B cells by MEDI-551 reduces worsening in Kur tzke Expanded Disability Severity 
Scale (EDSS) and decreases the loss of low-contrast visual acui ty in adult subjects with 
NMO/NMOSD. 
• Depletion of CD19+ B cells by MEDI-551 reduces NMO/NMOSD-relate d in-patient hospitalizations. 
• Depletion of CD19+ B cells by MEDI-551 reduces the cumulative n umber of active lesions found on 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  
OBJECTIVES:   
Primary Objective:  To compare the efficacy of MEDI-551 versus placebo in reducing  the risk of an 
NMO/NMOSD attack in subjects with NMO/NMOSD.  
Secondary Objectives:  
1. To compare the efficacy of MEDI-551 versus placebo on the re duction of EDSS worsening in subjects 
with NMO/NMOSD. 
2. To compare the efficacy of MEDI-551 versus placebo on the ch ange from baseline of low-contrast 
visual acuity score in subjects with NMO/NMOSD. 
3. To compare the efficacy of MEDI-551 versus placebo in reduci ng the cumulative active MRI lesion 
count (new gadolinium [Gd]-enhancing or new/enlarging T2). 
4. To compare the efficacy of MEDI-551 versus placebo in reduci ng NMO/NMOSD-related in-patient 
hospitalizations in subjects with NMO/NMOSD. 
5. To characterize the long-term efficacy of MEDI-551 by means of annualized attack rate. 
6. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single course o f MEDI-551 in subjects with NMO/NMOSD 
in the Randomized-controlled Period (RCP) and repeated doses of  MEDI-551 in the Open Label Period 
(OLP). 
7. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and immunog enicity of MEDI-551 in NMO/NMOSD 
subjects. 
Exploratory Objectives:  
1. To compare the effect of MEDI-551 versus placebo on health-r elated quality of life (HRQoL) as 
measured by the 4-week recall S hort Form-36 (S F-36) Health  Surv ey physical component score (PCS) 
and mental component score (MCS) in NMO/NMOSD subjects. 
2. To compare the effect of MEDI-551 versus placebo on pain as measured using the pain numeric rating 
scale (NRS). 
3. To characterize the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile (B cells an d plasma cell signature) of MEDI-551 in 
NMO/NMOSD subjects.  
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 3 of 214 4. To compare the effect of MEDI-551 versus placebo on aquapori n-4-antibody (AQP4-IgG) titer. 
5. To compare the effect of MEDI-551 versus placebo on soluble biomarkers (eg, cytokines, chemokines, 
and immunoglobulins) and genomic (ribonucleic acid [RNA; microR NA]) biomarkers and other 
relevant cells (eg, T cells, astrocytes) in NMO/NMOSD subjects.  
STUDY ENDPOINTS 
Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint is the time (days) from Day 1 to onset of an Adjudication 
Committee (AC)-determined NMO/NMOSD attack on or before Day 197 . The definition of an 
NMO/NMOSD attack is the presence of a new symptom(s) or worseni ng of an existing symptom(s) related 
to NMO/NMOSD that meets at least ONE of the protocol-defined cr iteria for an NMO/NMOSD attack.   
Secondary Endpoints: 
Endpoints 1, 2,  3, and 4 are key  secondary endpoints to be cons idered for studywise Type I error control. 
1. Worsening from baseline in EDSS at last visit during the RCP . 
2. Change from baseline in low-contrast visual acuity binocular  score measured by low-contrast Landolt C 
Broken Rings Chart, at last visit during RCP. 
3. Cumulative total active MRI lesions (new Gd-enhancing or new /enlarging T2) during the RCP. 
4. Number of NMO/NMOSD-related in-patient hospitalizations. In- patient hospitalization is defined as 
more than an overnight stay. 
5. Annualized attack rate (total number of AC-determined NMO/NM OSD attacks normalized by 
personyears-) during any exposure to MEDI-551.  
6. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including treatme nt-emergent serious adverse events 
(TESAEs). Laboratory measurements as well as their changes or s hift from baseline over time. 
7. Pharmacokinetic profile of MEDI-551. 
8. Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) directed against ME DI-551 for the duratio n of the study, both 
predose and postdose for each subject. 
 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
1. Change from baseline in the 4-week recall SF-36 PCS and MCS at the last visit during the RCP.  
2. Change from baseline in pain NRS in 5 locations at the last visit during the RCP. 
3. B-cell counts (total and subsets). 
4. Change from baseline in plasma cell gene signature. 
5. Serum AQP4-IgG titers. 
 
STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-masked , placebo-controlled- study with an open-
label extension period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of i ntravenous (IV) MEDI-551 in adult subjects 
with AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative NMO and NMOSD. Enro llment of subjects into the study will 
stop when a total of 67 AC-determined NMOSD attacks have occurr ed, when 252 subjects have been 
randomized and dosed, or following a recommendation by the inde pendent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) to stop enrollment, whichever occurs first. Following a s creening period of up to 28 days, subjects 
will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive IV MEDI-551 (300 m g at Day 1 and 300 mg at Day 15) or 
placebo for a period of 197 days (RCP).  
Subjects who complete the RCP without experiencing an NMO/NMOSD  attack will be given the option to 
enroll into an OLP and will initiate or continue treatment with  MEDI-551. Subjects who experience an AC-
determined NMO/NMOSD attack during the RCP will be given the op tion to enroll- into the OLP following 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-MEDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 4 of 214 rescue therapy. Subjects for whom the NMO/NMOSD attack is not d etermined by the AC will continue in 
the RCP until Day 197 (or until another attack occurs that is d etermined by the AC). 
The OLP will continue for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 3 years after the last subject enters the 
OLP, or until regulatory approval for MEDI-551 as treatment for  NMO in the participating country, or until 
the Sponsor discontinues development of MEDI-551 in this indica tion, whichever occurs first. Subjects can 
choose to exit the OLP at any time for any reason, including se eking alternative treatment options, at which 
point they will enter the Safety Follow-up Period (SFP; unless consent is withdrawn). 
All subjects will continue in the SFP for a total of 12 months from last dose to evaluate the long-term safety 
of the investigational product. 
Screening Period 
Subjects with the diagnosis of NMO/NMOSD will be screened over a 28-day period to establish their 
eligibility to participate in the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. AQP4-IgG serostatus will 
be determined by the central laboratory. For subjects who are f ound to be AQP4-IgG negative in the 
screening peri od, relevant  data documenting t heir NMO disease w ill be assessed by an independent 
Eligibility Committee to ensure that the data are consistent wi th the diagnosis of NMO. All subjects who 
fulfill eligibility criteria will then be randomized into the s tudy.  
Subjects undergoing screening at the time when the 252nd subject is randomized and dosed, subjects in 
screening at the time the 67th AC-determined attack is confirmed, or subjects undergoing scre ening at the 
time enrollment is terminated for any other reason, will not be  randomized. 
Randomization (Day 1) 
Two hundred and fifty-two subjects will be randomized into the study in a 3:1 ratio to receive IV MEDI-551 
or placebo as described below. Randomization will occur on Day 1 and will be stratified by AQP4-IgG 
serostatus (in a ratio of approximately 80:20 seropositive and seronegative subjects, respectively) and by 
region (Japan vs non-Japan). 
Randomized-controlled Period (Day 1 to Day 197) 
Following randomization on Day 1, subjects will be treated with  MEDI-551 or  placebo on Day 1 and Day 
15. An oral corticosteroid course will be initiated on Day 1 (pr ednisone 20 mg/day or equivalent oral
glucocorticoid) and continue until Day 14. Tapering the oral co rticosteroids will oc cur from Day 15 to Day
21. By Day 21, tapering must be completed.
The planned dura tion of th e RCP for each subject will be 197 da ys. All subjects who complete the RCP
without experiencing an NMO/NMOSD attack will be given the opti on to enter the OLP. Subjects who are in
the RCP when a total of 67 AC-determined NMOSD attacks have occ urred or subjects who are in the RCP
when enrollment is discontinued upon recommendation of the inde pendent DMC based on evidence of
efficacy and safety, will discontinue the RCP as soon as possib le, preferably within 14 days, and be given the
option to enter the OLP.
Subjects will be monitored for new or worsening symptoms relate d to NMO/NMOSD during scheduled
study visits and with follow-up phone calls every 2 weeks betwe en study visits (or if a scheduled visit is
missed).
When a possible new or worsening symptom(s) related to NMO/NMOS D is identified, subjects will be
required to inform the site. If an Assessment Visit is deemed n ecessary, this must be scheduled as soon as
possible but within 72 hours of reporting of the symptom to the  site. At the Assessment Visit, subjects will
initially undergo evaluations to determine if the symptoms are related to NMO/NMOSD; if related, the
subjects will undergo further evaluations to determine if the s ymptoms meet at least ONE of the protocol-
defined criteria for an NMO/NMOSD attack. In cases where a new or worsening symptom(s) does not meet
at least one of the protocol-defined criteria for an NMO/NMOSD attack, the subject will continue in the
RCP.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 5 of 214 Assessment of new symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms sh ould be completed wi thin 5 da ys to 
determine if an attack has occurred. Treatment of an attack sho uld preferably be initiated after completion of 
the attack assessment and the determination that the protocol a ttack criteria have been met. However, the 
Principal Investigator can initiate rescue therapy at any time before full assessment is completed. Rescue 
therapy will be given as directed by the investigator. This may  include IV corticosteroids, intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG), and/or plasma exchange (PLEX). 
Upon completion of the Assessment Visit, the complete set of da ta generated from the assessments will be 
sent to the AC regardless of whether an NMO/NMOSD attack was di agnosed according to the protocol 
criteria by the Principal Investigator. The adjudication proces s will be completed within 14 days (+ 3 days) 
from initiation of the Assessment Visit and the AC determinatio n will be communicated to the Principal 
Investigator.  
Subjects for whom the diagnosis of an NMO/NMOSD attack is not d etermined by the AC will be given the 
option to continue i n the RCP until Day 197.  Subjects for whom the diagnosis of an NMO/NMOSD attack is 
determined by the AC will be given the option to enter the OLP.  In addition, subjects who experience an 
NMO/NMOSD attack that requires rescue treatment and meets the p rotocol-defined criteria, regardless of the 
outcome of the AC review, will undergo an Attack Follow-up Visi t 28 days from Day 1 of the Assessment 
Visit. This visit may correspo nd with an OLP or SFP visit or ma y be scheduled separately. 
If subjects do not wish to enter the OLP or wish to leave the R CP at any point, they will continue to the SFP 
(unless consent is withdrawn). 
Enrollment of subjects into the study will stop when a total of  67 AC-determined NMOSD attacks have 
occurred, when 252 subjects have been randomized and dosed, or following a recommendation by the 
independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to stop enrollment,  whichever occurs first. 
Open-label Period 
Subjects will be given the option to enter the OLP if they 1) c omplete 197 days of the RCP, or 2) experience 
an AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack during the RCP, 3) are in the  RCP at the time that 67 AC-
determined attacks have occurred, or 4) are in the RCP at the t ime the Sponsor discontinues enrollment upon 
recommendation of the independent DMC based on evidence of effi cacy and safety. 
Subjects who discontinue the RCP for reasons other than one of these four mentioned above will not be 
eligible for the OLP. Reasons for subjects not entering the OLP  will be captured. These subjects will be 
followed for safety in the SFP. 
The first day of the OLP will be Day 1 (OLP Day 1). Upon enteri ng the OLP, subjects will receive 
MEDI-551. During the OLP, subjects will be followed at schedule d study visits and will continue on 
MEDI-551 therapy. The OLP will continue for minimum of 1 year a nd a maximum of 3 years (after the last 
subject enters), or until regulatory approval for MEDI-551 in t he participating country, or until the Sponsor 
discontinues development of MEDI-551 in this indication, whiche ver occurs first. Subjects can choose to 
exit the OLP at any time for any reason, including seeking alte rnative treatment options, at which point they 
will enter the SFP (unless consent is withdrawn). 
Subjects will be followed for NMO/NMOSD attacks in the same fas hion as in the RCP and events will be 
centrally adjudicated.  
Safety Follow-up Period 
The SFP will start when a subject prematurely discontinues from  the RCP or OLP. The length of the SFP 
will be determined by the time elapsed from the time of the las t dose of the investigational product to the 
time of the premature discontinuation, to complete a total of 5 2 weeks.  During the SFP, the subject will be 
monitored for adverse events/serious adverse events, B-cell lev els, ADAs, and immunoglobulin levels. 
During the SFP, a subject may receive standard treatment for th eir NMO/NMOSD at the discretion of the 
investigator.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 6 of 214 TARGET SUBJECT POPULATION 
The subjects in this study will be adult women and men (aged 18  years and above) with a diagnosis of NMO 
or NMOSD at the  time of screening and a documented history of 1  or more NMO/NMOSD acute relapses 
that required rescue therapy within the last year or 2 or more NMO/NMOSD acute relapses that required 
rescue therapy within the 2 years prior to screening. Both AQP4 -IgG seropositive and seronegative subjects 
will be enrolled in the study to fully capture the entire spect rum of this potentially fatal and rare 
demyelinating neurological disease. 
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSAGE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION 
Randomized-controlled Period 
• Treatment Arm 1: 300 mg IV MEDI -551 on Day 1  and Day 15 
• Treatment Arm 2: IV Placebo on Day 1 and Day 15 
Additionally, all subjects entering the RCP will be treated for  2 weeks (Day 1 to Day 14) with oral 
corticosteroids (prednisone 20 mg/day or equivalent oral glucoc orticoid). A tapering schedule will be 
implemented from Day 15 to Day 21.  
Open-label Period 
Subjects randomized to Treatment Arm 1  during the RCP will receive:  
• 300 mg IV MEDI-551 on OLP Day 1, masked IV placebo on OLP Day 1 5, then 300 mg IV MEDI-551 
every 26 weeks (Q26W) thereafter 
Subjects randomized to Treatment Arm 2  during the RCP will receive:  
• 300 mg IV MEDI-551 on OLP Day 1, ma sked 300 mg IV  MEDI-551 on O LP Day 15, then 300 mg IV 
MEDI-551 Q26W thereafter 
Dosing of subjects enrolling into the OLP following an adjudica ted NMO/NMOSD attack, following the 
occurrence of the 67th adjudicated NMO/NMOSD attack, or followi ng termination of enrollment upon 
recommendation of the independent DMC based on evidence of effi cacy and safety, will follow the OLP 
dosing regimen described above. 
For both the RCP and the OLP, investigational product will be a dministered as a 90-minute IV infusion via 
an infusion pump. All subjects will be premedicated on Day 1 an d Day 15 (OLP Day 1 and OLP Day 15) 
and at subsequent dosing visits with IV methylprednisolone (100  mg or equivalent glucocorticoid), oral (PO) 
diphenhydramine (25-50 mg or equivalent antihistamine), and PO paracetamol (acetaminophen; 500-650 
mg) prophylactically to prevent infusion reactions. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN: 
The primary analysis of time to onset of AC-determined attack e mploys a sequential testing procedure that 
initially compares treatment groups within AQP4-IgG seropositiv e subjects, and if statistically significant 
(two-sided α = 0.05), further compares treatment groups (two-si ded α = 0.05) within the broader Intent-to-
Treat (ITT) population, defined as all subjects who are randomi zed and receive at least one dose of 
investigational product. Furthermore, these analyses will analy ze subjects according to the initial 
randomization regardless of actual treatment received. The trea tment effect in the seropositive cohort will be 
assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model with treatmen t indicator (MEDI-551 or placebo) as an 
explanatory factor; whereas for the ITT population, the model w ill also include serostatus as an additional 
explanatory factor. Subjects who complete Day 197 of the RCP or  discontinue the study before Day 197 for 
reasons other than an AC-determined- NMO/NMOSD attack will be c ensored in this model at the time of the 
Day 197/discontinuation visit. An evaluation of consistency of treatment effect in Japanese subjects with that 
observed in the global study will be determined. The data cutof f for the primary analysis will be when the 
last subject completes the discontinuation visit following the 67th AC-determined attack, after all subjects 
complete the RCP if 67 AC-determined attacks do not occur, or w hen the last subject completes the 
discontinuation visit followin g discontinuation of enrollment u pon recomme ndation of the independent DMC 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 7 of 214 based on evidence of efficacy and safety. Subjects who are in t he RCP when a total of 67 AC-determined 
NMOSD attacks have occurred, or when enrollment is discontinued  upon recommendation of the 
independent DMC based on evidence of efficacy and safety, will discontinue the RCP as soon as possible, 
preferably within 14 days.  
Control of Type I Error 
The study is designed to strongly control the overall Type I er ror rate of α = 0.05. The primary null 
hypothesis will be hierarchically tested first at α = 0.05 in t he seropositive cohort, and if significant, it will be 
further tested in the ITT population at α = 0.05. If, and only if, the treatment group comparison is statistically 
significant within the ITT population, the secondary hypotheses  will be tested. Null hypotheses for the 4 key 
secondary endpoints will follow the same sequential testing str ategy as the primary analysis (testing within 
seropositive subjects first, followed by the ITT population if the comparison within seropositive subjects is 
statistically significant). Each secondary hypothesis will be i nitially tested based on the Bonferroni method at 
two-sided α=0.05/4 = 0.0125. If the null hypothesis for a parti cular secondary endpoint is rejected across 
both seropositive and ITT populations, the Type I error saved w ill be propagated equally to other non-
rejected secondary null hypotheses. The testing procedure will be repeated until all null hypotheses are 
rejected or no further null hypothesis can be rejected. 
The safety data will be presented using the as-treated populati on, which will include all subjects who receive 
any investigational product analyzed according to treatment rec eived. Specifically, subjects randomized to 
MEDI-551 who received all placebo doses will be included in the  placebo group for safety analyses; 
conversely, subjects who received at least one dose of MEDI-551  will be included in the active treatment 
group for safety analyses. Efficacy and safety data from the OL P will be presented based on subjects who 
receive at least one dose during the OLP. Unless otherwise spec ified, all statistical inference will be 
performed at a significance level of two-sided D ൌ ͲǤͲͷǤ  
Sample Size and Power Calculations 
The current study is being planned to detect a target relative reduction of 60% in risk for time from Day 1 to 
onset of AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack on or before Day 197 wi th at least 90% power and α = 0.05 
(two-sided). A total of 67 AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks are required for the ITT population. 
Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either ME DI-551 or placebo within both AQP4-IgG 
seropositive and seronegative strata. The stratification ratio is anticipated to be approximately 80:20 with 
higher allocation to the seropositive cohort. If the seropositi ve cohort has 80% of the attacks, the study w ill 
have approximately 82% power to detect the target relative redu ction of 60%. 
Two hundred and fifty-two subjects will be randomized and dosed . This sample size is based on a blinded 
review of the attack rate for the first 78 subjects to complete  the RCP and a simulation based on these 
subjects that indicates a > 90% probability of achieving the re quired 67 AC-determined attacks with 252 
subjects.  
Within each AQP4-IgG stratum, randomization will also be strati fied by region (Japan versus non-Japan). 
The number of Japanese subjects will be determined primarily by  feasibility and will not depend on a 
minimum number of NMO/NMOSD attacks to be observed from Japanes e subjects. The study may conclude 
enrollment regardless of the number of subjects in Japan versus  non-Japan regions. 
Interim Analysis 
An unmasked interim analysis will be conducted for futility ass essment by an independent Data Monitoring 
Committee when approximately 34 AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks  occur in this study. The study 
may be declared as “futile” if calculated predictive power at i nterim is < 20%.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 18 of 214 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Disease Background 
Neuromyelitis optica (NMO; also known as Devic’s syndrome) is a  rare, chronic, 
autoimmune, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central  nervous system (CNS) 
characterized by attacks of predominantly optic neuritis (ON) a nd longitudinally extensive 
transverse myelitis (LETM). Commonly reported symptoms include unilateral and bilateral 
loss of visual acuity, ocular pain, loss of sensation, severe p araplegia, bladder and bowel 
dysfunction, paroxysmal tonic spasms of the trunk and limbs, an d Lhermitte’s phenomenon. 
Brain and brain stem involvement are rare but can occur, usuall y as an extension of a severe 
cervical myelitis, and may cause symptoms such as nausea, intra ctable vomiting, hiccups, and 
acute neurogenic respiratory failure ( Wingerchuk et al, 1999 ; Misu et al, 2005 ). Up to 90% of 
patients with NMO have relapsing episodes of ON and myelitis ra ther than a monophasic 
course ( Ghezzi et al 2004 ; Wingerchuk et al 1999 ). Relapses occur within 1 year of onset in 
60% of patients and within 3 years in 90%. Relapses can be seve re and result in blindness, 
paralysis, and even death due to neurogenic respiratory failure  (Oh and Levy, 2012 ). 
Incomplete recovery from attacks is typical, and accumulative d isabilities arise from the 
severity and frequency of attacks. By some estimates, within 5 years, > 50% of patients are 
blind in one or both eyes or require ambulatory help ( Wingerchuk et al, 2007 ). Historically, 
mortality in NMO was as high as 30% at 5 years, but a more rece nt study suggests 9% at 6 
years ( Kitley, Leite et al, 2012 ).  
Once thought to be a variant of multiple sclerosis (MS), NMO/ne uromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorders (NMOSD) are now recognized as a distinct disease ( Wingerchuk et al, 2007 ). A 
defining feature of NMO is the presence of serum autoantibodies  against aquaporin-4 (AQP4) 
(ie, AQP4-immunoglobulin G [IgG] or NMO-IgG), which is detected  in 60% to 90% of 
NMO/NMOSD patients ( Jarius and Wildemann, 2010 ). Aquaporin-4 is the most abundant 
water channel expressed on the plasma membrane of astrocytes th roughout the CNS. AQP4-
IgG is thought to be pathogenic by causing astrocyte loss throu gh activation of lytic 
complement components, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis  (ADCP) and antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or by unfavorably al tering astrocyte physiology 
by reducing expression of key water channel proteins. AQP4-IgG is produced by CD19 
positive (CD19+) B-lineage plasmablasts ( Chihara et al, 2011 ), and that the presence of these 
plasmablasts correlates with disease activity in NMO ( Chihara et al, 2011 ; 
Kim et al, Sept 2011 ; Greenberg et al, 2012 ). It has been demonstrated that subpopulations of 
CD19+ and CD20 negative (CD20-) B cells showing morphological a nd phenotypical 
properties of plasmablasts are increased selectively in the per ipheral blood of NMO patients 
and that anti-AQP4 antibodies are produced by these cells. Thes e subsets of B cells have 
shown to expand in the 2 weeks prior to and during NMO attacks.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 19 of 214 Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders include limited forms o f NMO, which include severe 
or bilateral ON, transverse myelitis (TM), recurrent ON or TM, brainstem disorders (including 
intractable hiccup, nausea, or vomiting), hypothalamic disorder s (including hypersomnia and 
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; Popescu et al, 2011 ), and some 
encephalitic presentations but are unified by the detection of AQP4-IgG in serum or 
cerebrospinal fluid ( Jacob et al, 2012 ).  
Treatment for NMO/NMOSD includes management of acute attacks, p revention of attacks, 
monitoring adverse events (AEs), and evaluating changes in ther apy for breakthrough disease 
or lack of tolerability. Currently, there are no approved treat ments in any country indicated for 
the treatment of NMO/NMOSD, and to date, there have been no con trolled clinical studies for 
this disease. Patients with NMO/NMOSD are typically treated pro phylactically with off-label 
immunosuppressants such as azathioprine (AZA), mycophenolate mo fetil (MMF), daily 
prednisone, or rituximab to prevent relapses. High-dose steroid s and plasma exchange are 
generally used for the acute management of relapses. Results of  uncontrolled studies with 
rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the hum an CD20 molecule 
(Browning, 2006 ), provide evidence for the therapeutic effect of B-cell deplet ion 
in NMO/NMOSD ( Cree et al, 2005 ; Jacob et al, 2008 ; Bedi et al, 2011 ; Kim et al, Nov 2011 ; 
Ip et al, 2013 ). B-cell analysis of rituximab failures revealed the presence of CD19+/CD20- 
plasmablasts (Dr Larry Steinman, Professor, Stanford University , personal communication), 
which support the need for a more effective B-cell depleting mA b than rituximab in the 
treatment of this disease. Therefore, it is conceivable that di rect suppression of CD19+ B cells 
could be more effective in mitigating the impact of plasmablast s on NMO/NMOSD attacks 
than suppression of CD20+ B cells. Anti-CD20 mAbs may work by s tarving CD19+ 
plasmablast generation (ie, by targeting CD19+ and CD positive (CD20+) memory B cells 
rather than CD19+ plasmablasts directly). This suggests that ta rgeting CD19+ B cells has a 
potential advantage over targeting CD20+ B cells as a therapeut ic intervention for treating 
NMO and NMOSD.  
1.2 MEDI-551 Background 
MEDI-551 is briefly described below. Refer to the current Inves tigator’s Brochure (IB) for 
details.  
MEDI-551 is a humanized, affinity-optimized, afucosylated immun oglobulin G1 kappa 
(IgG1κ) mAb that binds to the B-cell specific surface antigen C D19 resulting in the depletion 
of B cells. MEDI-551 is glycoengineered by expression of mAb 16 C4 in a fucosyltransferase-
deficient Chinese hamster ovary producer cell line (BioWa Potel ligent® Technology), which 
generates a homogenously afucosylated antibody. The removal of fucose from the mAb Fc 
results in approximately 10-fold increased affinity for the act ivating Fc J receptor IIIA and 
significantly enhances ADCC. The antigen-binding properties of MEDI-551 (high affinity, 
slow internalization, and slow off-rate) are favorable for an A DCC-dependent mechanism of 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 20 of 214 action. MEDI-551 is composed of 2 light chains and 2 heavy chai ns, with an overall molecular 
weight of approximately 149 kilodalton (kDa). MEDI-551 does not  mediate complement-
dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). 
1.3 Summary of Nonclinical Experience 
Nonclinical evaluation demonstrated that MEDI-551 specifically recognizes human CD19 and 
has poor or no cross-reactivity to CD19 expressed on cells from  nonhuman primates, rodents, 
or rabbits. Therefore, the human CD19 transgenic (huCD19 TG) mo use was selected as the 
relevant animal model for testing the pharmacodynamics (PD) and  toxicology of MEDI-551. 
In huCD19 TG mice, MEDI-551 effectively depleted B cells in blo od and tissue. The duration 
of B-cell depletion was dose-dependent and was sustained for mo re than 10 weeks after 
treatment with a single 250 μg injection of MEDI-551. An additi onal 4-6 weeks were required 
for the B cells to recover to levels and maturities similar to those in immunoglobulin (Ig) G 
control-treated animals. The effect of treatment with MEDI-551 was limited to B cells and did 
not have an impact on other immune cells in circulation, as ass essed by flow cytometry. Thus, 
MEDI-551 selectively targets and depletes B cells. Furthermore,  during the course of the 
study, the levels of Ig in serum increased in control animals. These increases in serum Ig were 
blocked in groups treated with MEDI-551, suggesting that MEDI-5 51 inhibits antibody 
production. In a murine model of experimental systemic sclerosi s (SSc), where production of 
pathogenic autoantibodies requires CD19+ B cells, MEDI-551 was highly effective at 
reducing circulating and target tissue infiltrating B cells. To tal serum Ig, autoantibodies, and 
deposition of complement proteins in target tissues were also r educed by MEDI-551. These 
findings demonstrate that treatment with MEDI-551 may result in  clinical benefit in 
autoimmune diseases in which B-cell-dependent T-cell activation  and autoantibodies are 
thought to have pathogenic roles. 
Completed nonclinical toxicology studies with the huCD19 TG mou se model demonstrated 
that there were no adverse effects after a single intravenous ( IV) dose (up to 50 mg/kg), 
5 weekly IV doses (up to 36.6 mg/kg), or 13 or 26 weekly IV dos es (up to 30 mg/kg). The 
only findings from these toxic ology studies were related to the  pharmacologic action of B-cell 
depletion. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for MED I-551 as a single IV agent 
is at least 36.6 mg/kg/week for up to 1 month and 30 mg/kg/week  for multiple IV doses up to 
6 months. Results of a fertility and embryo-fetal development ( EFD) study showed no adverse 
findings in the study, other than a treatment-related reduction  in fertility index and the number 
of mice that were pregnant/number of mice in cohabitation. Impo rtantly, there was no MEDI-
551 impact on EFD. Treatment with MEDI-551 resulted in the expe cted pharmacological 
depletion of total B lymphocytes in peripheral blood of adult m ice. 
An additional 13-week repeat-dose study to evaluate the toxicit y of weekly subcutaneous (SC) 
administration of MEDI-551 (3 or 30 mg/kg SC; 30 mg/kg IV compa rator) has been 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 21 of 214 completed. While the findings during the dosing phase were simi lar to those identified in the 
previous repeat dose toxicology studies, during the recovery ph ase an increased incidence of 
background bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas (benign) was noted in t he 30 mg/kg IV group only. 
Given that this finding is isolated to this study and was not o bserved in the longer duration, 
26-week chronic toxicity study (which also included a 30 mg/kg IV group), the relevance to 
overall risk assessment for patients is unknown.

1.4 Summary of Clinical Experience 
The current clinical program for MEDI-551 consists of two compl eted Phase 1 studies, one in 
adults with SSc (Study MI-CP200) and one in adults with relapsi ng forms of MS (Study CD-
IA-MEDI-551-1102), and 6 ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in  adults with B-cell 
malignancies (Studies MI-CP204, CD-ON-MEDI-551-1088, CD-ON-MEDI -551-1019, 
D2852C00004, J1340, and D2850C00001).  
Across these studies, MEDI-551 has been and is being administer ed as an IV infusion at 
single doses up to 10 mg/kg, at multiple doses up to 12 mg/kg. For Study MI-CP204, the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MEDI-551 was not observed. The highest planned doses 
were 10 mg/kg (median exposure of 675 mg [480-1,034 mg]) in Stu dy MI-CP200 and 
12 mg/kg (maximum median average monthly exposure and duration of 1218.2 mg 
[618.7-2152 mg] and 6.0 months [1.0-24.1 months]) in Study MI-C P204. 
Study CD-IA-MEDI-551-1102 in relapsing forms of MS evaluated th e safety and tolerability 
of a single course of IV MEDI-551 (30, 100, or 600 mg) or place bo administered twice as a 
fixed IV dose on Day 1 and Day 15, or a single dose of SC MEDI- 551 (60 or 300 mg) or 
placebo over a 24-week period with long-term follow up for all subjects for B-cell recovery. 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in studies of 
MEDI-551 in subjects with SSc or relapsing forms of MS include infusion-related reaction, 
nausea, fatigue, pain in extremity, arthralgia, and cough. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
in studies of MEDI-551 in subjects with advanced B-cell maligna ncies include infusion-
related reaction, anemia, fatigue, chills, cough, diarrhea, nau sea, vomiting, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, pyrexia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypert riglyceridemia, and 
hypokalemia.  
Infusion-related reaction is the only identified risk of IV MED I-551 to date, and has occurred 
in both oncology and nononcology studies with MEDI-551. Althoug h the exact mechanism of 
the MEDI-551-associated infusion-related reaction is unknown, s uch events can occur with 
the administration of foreign proteins such as other types of m Abs. The risk of 
infusion-related reaction is mitigated by premedicating subject s prior to administration of IV 
MEDI-551. While premedication may reduce infusion-related react ions, it may not completely 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22 of 214 eliminate the risk. To date, no serious infusion-related reacti ons have been reported in subjects 
who received protocol-defined premedication prior to administra tion of IV MEDI-551.  
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been repor ted in the setting of B-cell 
depleting therapies and other immunosuppressive regimens ( Calabrese et al, 2015 ) and is a 
potential risk of treatment with MEDI-551. A subject in Study C D-IA-MEDI-551-1155 
developed altered mental state, seizures, and new brain lesions  that on brain MRI raised 
suspicion of PML. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for the Joh n Cunningham virus (JCV) 
was performed, with inconclusive results (two negative results in reference laboratories and 
one positive result in a local laboratory). Brain tissue was no t available for examination. The 
subject died from cardiopulmonary complications. Based on all a vailable data, the differential 
diagnosis included acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM),  atypical NMOSD attack, 
and PML. No conclusive diagnosis could be made. 
Details of all clinical studies with MEDI-551 are provided in t he IB. 
1.5 Rationale for Study 
MEDI-551 is a humanized, affinity-optimized, afucosylated IgG1κ  mAb that binds to the 
B-cell specific surface antigen CD19 resulting in the depletion  of B cells. It is currently in 
clinical development in diseases such as B-cell malignancies an d relapsing forms of MS, 
where B-cell depletion may have or has been shown to have a the rapeutic effect.  
Neuromyelitis optica/NMOSD is a rare, chronic, relapsing disord er with debilitating effects. 
There are currently no medicinal products approved for the prev ention of NMO/NMOSD 
relapses or the treatment of acute relapses.  Off-label medicat ions are currently being used for 
the prevention and treatment of NMO/NMOSD relapse based on low- level evidence and 
unproven efficacy. There is a high unmet medical need for more effective therapies in this 
patient population. Furthermore, to date, no randomized-control led clinical trials have been 
conducted in this patient population. 
Available research shows NMO/NMOSD to be an autoantibody-mediat ed, plasmablast-driven 
disease, and that depleting B cells may have an impact on delay ing or preventing relapse and 
disease progression. Since the results of small, uncontrolled s tudies of the anti-CD20 mAb 
rituximab have provided evidence for the therapeutic effect of B-cell depletion in 
NMO/NMOSD ( Cree et al, 2005 ; Jacob et al, 2008 ; Bedi et al, 2011 ; Kim et al, Nov 2011 ; 
Ip et al, 2013 ) and that a CD19+ B-cell depleting agent may be more effective  than a CD20+ 
B-cell depleting agent in the treatment of this disease, this s tudy is being conducted to 
evaluate the efficacy of MEDI-551 in this target population. 
Results of preclinical and clinical studies with MEDI-551 demon strate that MEDI-551 
provides an acceptable risk-benefit ratio for patients with NMO /NMOSD and support the 
initiation of a registration study.

provided in Section 3.2.  
1.6 Research Hypotheses 
1.6.1 Primary Hypothesis 
The primary hypothesis for this study is that by depleting CD19 + B cells including 
plasmablasts and plasma cells, MEDI-551 is effective in reducin g the risk of NMO/NMOSD 
attack compared to placebo, thus effectively reducing the risk of irreversible disability caused 
by such attacks.  
1.6.2 Secondary Hypotheses 
The secondary hypotheses are:  
x Depletion of CD19+ B cells by MEDI-551 reduces worsening in Kur tzke Expanded 
Disability Severity Scale (EDSS) and decreases the loss of low- contrast visual acuity in 
adult subjects with NMO/NMOSD. 
x Depletion of CD19+ B cells by MEDI-551 reduces NMO/NMOSD-relate d in-patient 
hospitalizations. 
x Depletion of CD19+ B cells by MEDI-551 reduces the cumulative n umber of active 
lesions found on MRI.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Description of the Study 
3.1.1 Overview  
This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-masked , placebo-controlled- study 
with an open-label extension period to evaluate the efficacy an d safety of IV MEDI-551 in 
adult subjects with AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative NMO and NMOSD. Following a 
screening period of up to 28 days, a maximum of 252 subjects wi th NMO/NMOSD will be 
randomized and dosed, in a 3:1 ratio [IV MEDI-551 (300 mg at Da y 1 and 300 mg at Day 15) 
or placebo] for a period of 197 days (RCP). 
Enrollment of subjects into the study will stop when a total of  67 AC-determined NMOSD 
attacks occur, when 252 subjects have been randomized and dosed , or following a 
recommendation by the independent DMC to stop enrollment, which ever occurs first. 
Subjects who complete the RCP without experiencing an NMO/NMOSD  attack will be given 
the option to enroll into an OLP and will initiate or continue treatment with MEDI-551. 
Subjects who experience an NMO/NMOSD attack during the RCP, and  for whom the attack is 
determined by the AC, will be given the option to enroll into t he OLP following rescue 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 26 of 214 therapy. Subjects for whom the NMO/NMOSD attack is not determin ed by the AC will 
continue in the RCP until Day 197 (or until another attack occu rs that is determined by the 
AC). Subjects who are in the RCP when enrollment is discontinue d upon recommendation of 
the independent DMC based on evidence of efficacy and safety, w ill discontinue the RCP as 
soon as possible, preferably within 14 days, and be given the o ption to enter the OLP. 
The OLP will continue for a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 3 years after the last 
subject enters, or until regulatory approval for MEDI-551 as tr eatment for NMO in the 
participating country, or until the Sponsor discontinues develo pment of MEDI-551 in this 
indication, whichever occurs first as described in Figure 1. Su bjects can choose to exit the 
OLP at any time for any reason, including seeking alternative t reatment options, at which 
point they will enter the Safety Follow-up Period (SFP; unless consent is withdrawn). 
All subjects will continue in the SFP for a total of 12 months from last dose to evaluate the 
long-term safety of the investigational product.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 28 of 214 The endpoints to be measured in this study are described in Sec tion 2.2. 
3.1.1.1  Screening Period 
Subjects with the diagnosis of NMO/NMOSD will be screened over a 28-day period to 
establish their eligibility to participate in the study based o n the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria in Section 4.1.2 and Section 4.1.3, respectively. AQP4 -IgG serostatus will be 
determined by a central laboratory. For subjects who are found to be AQP4-IgG negative in 
the screening period, relevant data documenting their NMO disea se will be assessed by an 
independent Eligibility Committee (see Section 4.2.1.1) to ensu re that the data are consistent 
with the diagnosis of NMO. All subjects who fulfill eligibility  criteria will then be randomized 
into the study. Subjects undergoing screening at the time when the 252nd subject is 
randomized and dosed, subjects in screening at the time the 67th AC-determined attack is 
confirmed, and subjects undergoing screening at the time enroll ment is terminated for any 
other reason, will not be randomized. 
3.1.1.2  Randomization (Day 1) 
Two hundred and fifty-two subjects will be randomized into the study in a 3:1 ratio to receive 
IV MEDI-551 (300 mg) or placebo as described in Table 1. Random ization will occur on Day 
1 (within 28 days of the start of screening) and will be strati fied by AQP4-IgG serostatus (in a 
ratio of approximately 80:20 seropositive and seronegative subj ects, respectively) and by 
region (Japan vs non-Japan). 
3.1.1.3  Randomized-controlled Period (Day 1 to Day 197) 
Following randomization on Day 1, subjects will be treated with  MEDI-551 or placebo on 
Day 1 and Day 15. An oral corticosteroid course will be initiat ed on Day 1 (prednisone 
20 mg/day or equivalent oral glucocorticoid) and continue until  Day 14. Tapering of the oral 
corticosteroids will occur from Day 15 to Day 21. By Day 21, ta pering must be completed. 
During the RCP, subjects will be followed at scheduled study vi sits and by telephone 
interview as described in Table 6. The planned duration of the RCP for each subject will be 
197 days. All subjects who complete the RCP without experiencin g an NMO/NMOSD attack 
will be given the option to enter the OLP. Subjects who are in the RCP when a total of 67 
AC-determined NMOSD attacks have occurred, or when enrollment i s discontinued upon 
recommendation of the independent DMC based on evidence of effi cacy and safety, will 
discontinue the RCP as soon as possible, preferably within 14 d ays, and be given the option to 
enroll into the OLP. . 
The process for the diagnosis of an NMO/NMOSD attack is outline d in Figure 3. Subjects will 
be monitored for new or worsening symptoms related to NMO/NMOSD  during study visits 
and with follow-up phone calls every 2 weeks between study visi ts (or if a scheduled visit is 
missed).  
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 29 of 214 When a possible new or worsening symptom(s) related to NMO/NMOS D is identified, 
subjects will be required to inform the site. If an Assessment Visit is deemed necessary, this 
must be scheduled as soon as possible but within 72 hours of re porting of the symptom to the 
site. At the Assessment Visit, subjects will initially undergo evaluations to determine if the 
symptoms are related to NMO/NMOSD; if related, the subjects wil l undergo further 
evaluations to determine if the symptoms meet at least ONE of t he protocol-defined criteria 
for an NMO/NMOSD attack outlined in Table 11. In cases where a new or worsening 
symptom(s) does not meet at least one of the protocol-defined c riteria for an NMO/NMOSD 
attack, the subject will continue in the RCP. The data related to the assessment of the 
symptoms that were determined by the investigator as not relate d to NMO/NMOSD will be 
sent to the AC for review. 
Assessment of new symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms sh ould be completed within 
5 days to determine if an attack has occurred. Treatment of an attack should preferably be 
initiated after completion of the attack assessment and the det ermination that the protocol 
attack criteria have been met. However, the Principal Investiga tor can initiate rescue therapy 
at any time before full assessment is completed. Rescue therapy  will be given as directed by 
the investigator. This may include IV corticosteroids, intraven ous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 
and/or plasma exchange (PLEX). 
Upon completion of the Assessment Visit, the complete set of da ta generated from the 
assessments will be sent to the AC regardless of whether an NMO /NMOSD attack was 
diagnosed according to the protocol criteria by the Principal I nvestigator. The adjudication 
process will be completed within 14 days (+ 3 days) from initia tion of the Assessment Visit 
and the AC determination will be communicated to the Principal Investigator.  
The procedures for identifying and adjudicating an NMO/NMOSD at tack are described in 
Section 4.3.1.1. 
Subjects for whom the diagnosis of an NMO/NMOSD attack is not d etermined by the AC will 
be given the option to continue in the RCP until Day 197. Subje cts for whom the diagnosis of 
an NMO/NMOSD attack is determined by the AC will be given the o ption to enter the OLP. 
In addition, subjects who experience an NMO/NMOSD attack that r equires rescue treatment 
and meets the protocol-defined criteria, regardless of the outc ome of the AC review, will 
undergo an Attack Follow-up Visit 28 days from Day 1 of the Ass essment Visit. This visit 
may correspond with an OLP or SFP visit or may be scheduled sep arately. 
If subjects do not wish to enter the OLP or wish to leave the R CP at any point, they will 
continue to the SFP (unless consent is withdrawn).

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 30 of 214 3.1.1.4  Open-label Period 
Subjects will be given the option to enter the OLP if they: 
1 Complete 197 days of the RCP, or 
2 Experience an AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack during the RCP, or  
3 Are in the RCP at the time when 67 AC-determined attacks have o ccurred  
4 Are in the RCP when enrollment is discontinued upon recommendat ion of the DMC 
based on evidence of efficacy and safety (see Section 4.4). 
 
Subjects who discontinue from the RCP for reasons other than on e of the reasons above will 
not be eligible for the OLP. Reasons for subjects not entering the OLP will be captured. These 
subjects will be followed for safety in the SFP. 
The first day of the OLP will be Day 1 (OLP Day 1). Upon enteri ng the OLP for one of the 
three reasons outlined above, subjects will receive MEDI-551 as  described in Table 2. During 
the OLP, subjects will be followed at scheduled study visits an d will initiate or continue on 
MEDI-551 therapy per Table 7. The OLP will continue for a maxim um of 3 years (after the 
last subject enters), until regulatory approval for MEDI-551 in  each participating country or 
until the Sponsor discontinues development of MEDI-551 in this indication, whichever occurs 
first. Subjects can choose to exit the OLP at any time for any reason, including seeking 
alternative treatment options, at which point they will enter t he SFP (unless consent is 
withdrawn).  
Subjects will be followed for NMO/NMOSD attacks in the same fas hion as in the RCP and 
events will be centrally adjudicated.  
3.1.1.5  Safety Follow-up Period 
The SFP will start when a subject prematurely discontinues from  the RCP or OLP. The length 
of the SFP will be determined by the time elapsed from the time  of the last dose of the 
investigational product to the time of the premature discontinu ation, to complete a total of

in both MEDI-551 oncology and non-oncology studies. For subject s experiencing an infusion-
related reaction, an approach to these reactions based on sever ity of symptoms is presented in 
Table 3 and Appendix 2 (National Institute of Allergy and Infec tious Diseases [NIAID] and 
Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network [FAAN] Guidance for Anaphy laxis Diagnosis), with 
suggested treatment options. Final treatment is at the discreti on of the investigator and should 
reflect local standard of care.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 35 of 214 3.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale 
3.2.1 Study Design Rationale 
This study design was developed to provide balance between scie ntific considerations and 
patient safety. A placebo-comparator treatment arm was chosen b ecause there are no currently 
approved medications for the treatment of NMO/NMOSD. While ther e is anecdotal evidence 
for using various immunosuppressants in NMO/NMOSD, the efficacy  and safety profiles of 
these agents are not well characterized because there have been  no controlled clinical studies 
using these agents in this disease indication. The use of a pla cebo arm will allow for a clear 
and robust evaluation of MEDI-551 and provide for the highest s ensitivity to detect efficacy. 
The therapeutic estimation of the potential effect of MEDI-551 is based on published 
literature, albeit uncontrolled data, showing that B-cell deple tion may have a positive effect in 
preventing NMO/NMOSD attacks. The Sponsor expects that MEDI-551  will share the same 
class effects that have been seen with other B-cell depleting a gents in subjects with 
NMO/NMOSD.  
A 3:1 randomization scheme was chosen for this study. According  to Dumville et al (2006) , 
unequal randomization is particularly useful when the experimen tal group is expected to 
benefit greatly from a new treatment that would not have been o therwise available and can 
provide the clinician with a reduced learning curve by allowing  treatment in a higher 
percentage of subjects ( Dumville et al, 2006 ). The 3:1 randomization ratio is an effective and 
efficient approach to build an enriched safety database for MED I-551 while keeping the 
number of required events or subjects in the placebo arm at a m inimum acceptable level. This 
randomization ratio also addresses, to a certain degree, the se rious ethical/safety concerns of 
investigators and patients regarding enrollment of subjects to a placebo arm. In addition to 
limiting the number of subjects who receive placebo, the study has been designed to limit the 
actual duration of placebo exposure to a maximum of 197 days or  time to onset of an 
AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack, whichever occurs earlier, after  which all subjects will 
have the option to enter the OLP and receive MEDI-551.  
Due to the potential severity of NMO/NMOSD attacks and their de bilitating nature, the study 
is further designed to ensure safety in this subject population  through careful monitoring and 
early evaluation of signs and symptoms of NMO/NMOSD attacks, sc heduled study visits and 
study assessments, follow-up telephone contact every 2 weeks wi th study subjects by study 
site staff, a liberal “escape clause” (ie, immediate access to rescue therapy following 
identification of an NMO/NMOSD attack), and monitoring by an in dependent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC).  
Also, the informed consent form (ICF), which will include detai led explanation and 
risk:benefit expectations, will provide subjects and investigat ors the opportunity to discuss 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 36 of 214 appropriate risk estimation and to fully understand the risks a nd potential benefits of this 
study. 
The rationale for the use of oral corticosteroids (prednisone 2 0 mg/day or equivalent oral 
glucocorticoid) for the first 14 days, with a 1-week taper, is to provide prophylaxis against an 
NMO/NMOSD attack for the period wherein the PD effect of MEDI-5 51 is not expected. 
Based on our PK/PD data, a period of approximately 2-4 weeks is  required for maximal B-cell 
depletion to occur.  
In addition, studies with rituximab have reported a few attacks  in the first month of therapy 
possibly related to increased B-cell activating factor (BAFF; Bar-Or et al, 2010 ) and therefore 
an increase of AQP4-IgG titers. Feedback from external experts has suggested that providing 
such prophylaxis is viewed as particularly important in a setti ng where existing 
immunosuppressive regimens will be withdrawn at randomization. 
3.2.2 Dose Rationale 
The 300 mg dose of MEDI-551 was selected to achieve complete pe ripheral B-cell depletion. 
Based on existing PK and B-cell PD data from Study MI-CP200, a fixed dose of 300 mg 
MEDI-551 given on Day 1 and Day 15 is predicted to fully deplet e peripheral blood B cells to 
undetectable levels and maintain B-cell suppression for 28 week s, therefore sustaining B-cell 
depletion for the duration of the RCP. In theory, an initial do se of MEDI-551 will deplete the 
peripheral blood B cells; however, additional B cells will then  recirculate out of the lymphoid 
tissues. The second dose of MEDI-551 on Day 15 is timed to depl ete the newly recirculated 
B cells from the peripheral blood. 
This dose regimen is supported by clinical data from other B-ce ll depleting mAbs, where 
IV dosing on Day 1 and Day 15 will provide optimal B-cell deple tion in both blood and 
tissues ( Huffstutter et al, 2011 ; Hauser et al, 2008 ; Bar-Or et al, 2008;  Kappos et al, 2011 ).  
A fixed dose of 300 mg MEDI-551 administered on OLP Day 1 (and OLP Day 15 for subjects 
who received placebo in the RCP) and then every 26 weeks is pre dicted to fully deplete 
peripheral blood B cells to undetectable levels and maintain B- cell suppression for the dose 
interval of the OLP (Figure 2).

3.2.3 Rationale for Study Population 
This clinical study is designe d to study the efficacy and safet y of MEDI-551 as a maintenance 
treatment of subjects with estab lished NMO/NMOSD aimed to reduc e the risk of 
NMO/NMOSD attacks. Therefore, t he inclusion/exclusion criteria define a group of adult 
subjects (women and men aged 18 years and above) who must have a diagnosis of 
NMO/NMOSD at the time of scree ning and a documented history of 1 or more 
NMO/NMOSD acute relapses that required rescue therapy within th e last year, or 2 or more 
NMO/NMOSD acute relapses that required rescue therapy within th e 2 years prior to 
screening.  
Both AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative subjects will be en rolled in the study to fully 
capture the entire spectrum of t his potentially fatal and rare demyelinating neurological 
disease. There is a series of c linical studies showing that AQP 4-IgG is involved in the 
pathogenesis of NMO and that AQP 4-IgG may be predictive of rela pse and/or later 
conversion to definite NMO ( Weinshenker et al, 2006 ; Matiello et al, 2008 ). In a multicenter 
study of 175 Caucasian patients, b ilateral ON at onset was more  common in AQP4-IgG 
seronegative patients as was simultaneous ON and myelitis, and the time to diagnosis was 
shorter in the AQP4-IgG seronegative group. Additionally, the d isease course was more often 
monophasic in AQP4-IgG seronegative patients ( Jarius et al, 2012 ).  

MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 38 of 214 There is strong evidence to support the hypothesis that NMO is a pathologically 
heterogeneous disease, as even using the most reliable of recom binant assays, there are 
subsets of subjects who do not test seropositive for AQP4-IgG t hat may still present with 
NMO and conditions that may cause myelitis and ON by other mech anisms. It has been 
speculated that different etiological mechanisms are involved i n AQP4-IgG seronegative 
NMO/NMOSD. Recent studies have identified a subset of AQP4-IgG seronegative NMO 
patients who are positive for antibodies against myelin-oligode ndrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), 
a protein expressed on the outer surface of the myelin sheath a nd oligodendrocytes 
(Kitley, Woodhall et al, 2012 ; Mader et al, 2011 ), and for antibodies against CV2/CRMP5 
(Jarius et al, 2012 ). Since an anti-CD19 B-cell depleting mAb will remove the sour ce of 
AQP4-IgG, it should also remove the source of these antibodies.  The clinical presentation of 
an attack is considered by NMO experts to be indistinguishable between seropositive and 
seronegative NMO patients. 
Several assays have shown to be able to detect AQP4-IgG even in  samples taken from 
subjects during remission and treatment with strong immunosuppr essants such as rituximab, 
AZA, mitoxantrone, and/or cyclophosphamide, plausibly ruling ou t the likelihood that 
seronegativity is generally the result of insufficient assay se nsitivity.  
In addition, evidence for the therapeutic effect of B-cell depl etion with rituximab in NMO 
seropositive and seronegative subjects is supported by a number  of uncontrolled studies 
comparing relapse rates and EDSS scores before and after treatm ent (Jacob et al, 2008 ; 
Bedi et al, 2011 ; Kim SH et al, 2011 ; Ip et al, 2013 ). 
The AQP4-IgG status was available in all subjects in the previo usly described rituximab 
studies, with seronegative status occurring in nearly 20% to 30 % of NMO/NMOSD patients 
tested. 
Thus, this study population will include approximately 80% subj ects who are AQP4-IgG 
seropositive and 20% of subjects who are AQP4-IgG seronegative.  In subjects who are AQP4-
IgG seronegative, the diagnosis of NMO is less clear; therefore , these subjects must meet the 
clinical criteria for NMO according to Wingerchuk et al, 2006 and not have brain MRI lesions 
consistent with MS. In addition, screening data of these subjec ts will be reviewed by an 
independent Eligibility Committee to confirm the diagnosis of N MO in the absence of AQP4-
IgG seropositive status. 
The study allows for inclusion of a wide age range of subjects as recent international research 
has shown under-representation of older participants in clinica l studies. It is both unhelpful for 
optimal healthcare as well as fundamentally unjust to exclude p articipants from clinical 
research based solely on an arbitrary age limit ( Briggs et al, 2012 ).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 39 of 214 3.2.4 Rationale for Endpoints 
3.2.4.1  Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint of time (days) from Day 1 to onset of an A C-determined 
NMO/NMOSD attack on or before Day 197 is based on the natural h istory of the disease, 
which is characterized by a stepwise deterioration of motor, se nsory, visual, and 
bowel/bladder function ( Sellner et al, 2010 ), and recurrent attacks that can result in blindness, 
paralysis, and even death. Attacks of NMO/NMOSD are more severe  than MS and usually 
result in incomplete recovery and permanent deficits. Thus, est ablishing a primary endpoint 
using an annualized relapse rate as usually utilized in MS stud ies where subjects typically 
have mild attacks and exacerbations followed by varying degrees  of recovery, would expose 
subjects to a longer study period with an increased risk to the  placebo subjects. Utilizing time 
to attack as the primary endpoint limits subject exposure but s till provides a robust endpoint.  
3.2.4.2  Secondary Endpoints 
Worsening from Baseline in EDSS at Last Visit During the Random ized-controlled 
Period 
A subject will be considered to have a worsening in overall EDS S score if one of the 
following criteria is met:  
(a) Worsening of 2 or more points in EDSS score for patients with b aseline score of 0. 
(b) Worsening of 1 or more points in EDSS score for patients with b aseline score of 
1 to 5. 
(c) Worsening of 0.5 points or more in EDSS score for patients with  baseline score of 
5.5 or more. 
 
Myelitis attacks in NMO/NMOSD patients are severe and may lead to permanent disability. 
Measurement of disease progression in NMO/NMOSD patients is cri tically important since 
the potential for recovery depends on the severity of the attac ks. The EDSS is a commonly 
used measure of disability in MS, and given the lack of any val idated scales for NMO, is 
widely considered appropriate for measuring the level of disabi lity in patients with 
NMO/NMOSD. Because the time to achieve these EDSS scores is oft en long, a short-term 
indicator of disease progression can be applied to the disease course by using an increase in 
EDSS score sustained over several months called “sustained dise ase progression.” Several 
definitions of sustained disease progression for clinical trial s and observational studies have 
been proposed, including a 2- or more point increase in EDSS sc ore for patients with a 
baseline score of 0; an increase in 1 point or more in EDSS sco re for patients with a baseline 
score of 1-5; or an increase of 0.5 points or more in EDSS scor e for patients with a baseline 
score of 5.5 or more has been used in the literature.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 40 of 214 Change from Baseline in Low-contrast Visual Acuity Score Measured by Low-contrast 
Landolt C Broken Rings Chart at Last Visit During the Randomize d-controlled Period 
Visual loss and dysfunction are recognized disabling clinical m anifestations in patients with 
NMO/NMOSD. In MS clinical trials, low-contrast visual acuity em erged as the leading 
candidate to measure visual disability in MS. Subsequent studie s found that low contrast 
acuity testing correlated well with brain MRI lesion burden, vi sual evoked potentials and 
retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) loss as measured by optical co herence tomography (OCT). 
Worsening of visual function by a clinically significant > 7 le tters or approximately 1.5 lines 
for low-contrast acuity is associated with approximately 4.5 μm  reduction in RNFL thickness 
in MS. Additional longitudinal studies have shown RNFL axonal l oss over time that occurs 
even in the absence of an acute ON attack and correlates with c linical meaningful worsening 
of vision and quality of life in patients with MS. The low-cont rast visual acuity test is used to 
determine the number of letters that can be read on a standardi zed low-contrast Landolt C 
Broken Rings Chart held at a distance of 3 meters. Due to lack of standard visual function 
measures specific to NMO/NMOSD, and the fact that both MS and N MO/NMOSD patients 
can experience ON, and this endpoint has been previously used w idely in MS studies, there is 
good rationale for using this endpoint in this NMO/NMOSD study.  This secondary endpoint 
will evaluate whether MEDI-551 will have an effect on improving  vision sensitivity. 
Reduction in the Cumulative Total Active MRI Lesions (New Gd-en hancing or 
New/Enlarging T2) 
In clinical practice there is wide use of MRI in the diagnosis and management of NMO; 
however, the role of MRI in t his setti ng is not wel l establishe d and studied. The actual 
interpretation of MRI related to the diagnosis and the follow u p of patients with 
NMO/NMOSD are not consistently established. Therefore, this stu dy aims to collect 
longitudinal MRI data during both study periods including at th e time of an attack, to 
investigate the characteristics and evolution of spinal and bra in lesions in NMO/NMOSD. 
Number of NMO/NMOSD-related In-patient Hospitalizations During the Randomized-
controlled Period 
Patients with relapsing NMO/NMOSD have recurrent attacks that c an be severe and result in 
blindness, paralysis, and even death ( Oh and Levy, 2012 ). Consequently, such attacks 
frequently result in in-patient hospitalizations. Less severe a ttacks can be managed without the 
need for hospitalization. Post initial acute phase of an attack , the patient will often require 
ongoing care and rehabilitation in the recovery phase post an a ttack. Therefore, this secondary 
endpoint will evaluate whether MEDI-551 will be effective in re ducing NMO/NMOSD-
related hospitalizations compared to placebo. All hospitalizati ons recorded during the RCP 
will be included in the analysis.  
In-patient hospitalization, for the purposes of analysis of the  secondary endpoint, is defined as 
a stay in hospital that goes beyond midnight of the first day o f admission. Any duration of stay

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 41 of 214 (calculated as the difference between discharge date and admiss ion date) of more than 1 day 
will contribute to this endpoint. This includes the time a subj ect may enter an emergency 
department plus subsequent admission to a ward. Hospitalization s for the administration of 
NMO-related medications or procedures only (ie, the administrat ion or procedure was isolated 
and not provided during a subject’s hospitalization due to NMO for another reason) will not 
be included in the secondary endpoint analysis. 
Annualized Attack Rate (Total Number of Adjudication Committee- determined 
NMO/NMOSD Attacks Normalized by Total Person-years) During any Exposure to 
MEDI-551 
This endpoint will be evaluated in all subjects who receive at least one dose of MEDI-551.  
This secondary endpoint will be an important marker for assessi ng frequency of AC-
determined NMO/NMOSD attacks during long-term treatment with ME DI-551. Although no 
comparator is available for long-term comparison, a descriptive  summary of AC-determined 
NMO/NMOSD attack rate over various lengths of exposure to MEDI- 551 will provide a sense 
of constancy of attack rate. 
Safety and Tolerability of MEDI-551 
The safety and tolerability endpoints are designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
administration of MEDI-551 in subjects with NMO/NMOSD for this study population. These 
endpoints will be assessed primarily by summarizing TEAEs and T ESAEs, and changes from 
baseline in laboratory measurements (including ADA status and t iters and vaccine titers [see 
below]), significant physical examination findings, and vital s ign measurements. 
Vaccine Titers 
Vaccination results in immunological memory by expansion of ant igen specific CD4+ 
T-helper and CD8- cytotoxic cells as well as through induction of antigen-specific B–cell cell 
maturation and antibody secretion ( Siegrist, 2013 ). Given the depletion effect of MEDI-551 
on B cells, it is mechanistically relevant to investigate wheth er immunization responses are 
diminished by following vaccine-generated antibody titers, incl uding tetanus.

The literature provides evidence of the strong impact NMO has o n HRQoL

(Chanson et al, 2011 ); however, both PCS and MCS scores on the SF-36 Health Survey were 
significantly lower in NMO than for the general population, eve n in the cohort of patients 
outside an NMO attack period and with relatively low EDSS (mean  score: 3.5), indicating the 
importance of the HRQoL evaluation in NMO.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 42 of 214 Change from Baseline in Pain Numeric Rating Scale 
A number of recent publications have indicated that patients wi th NMO/NMOSD experience 
pain throughout the course of their disease. Pain in demyelinat ing and inflammatory CNS 
diseases can be disabling and may contribute to a lower quality  of life and overall increased 
health care burden. Neuromyelitis optica is associated with ext ensive spinal cord injury, 
brainstem disorders, ON, and sometimes a combination of these ( Qian et al, 2012 ) and pain in 
five different locations (eyes, legs, arms, upper back and lowe r back, respectively) will be 
measured at baseline and monthly thereafter throughout the stud y. 
B-cell Counts (Total and Subsets) 
As MEDI-551 binds to and depletes CD19+ B cells, the depletion is a direct measure of PD 
effect. Additionally, CD19+ plasmablasts are increased in the p eripheral blood on 
NMO/NMOSD patients and produce anti-AQP4 antibodies. Since AQP4 -IgG titers correlate 
with disease activity ( Jarius et al, 2008 ; Kim et al, Sept 2011 ), the extent and/or duration of 
B-cell/plasma-cell depletion may correlate with response to MED I-551 in these subjects.  
Plasma Cell Gene Signature 
Production of pathogenic autoantibodies by plasma cells is a ha llmark of autoimmune 
diseases; thus, plasma cell levels may be associated with the e fficacy of B-cell depleting 
therapies like MEDI-551. Flow cytometry methods commonly used t o enumerate and describe 
plasma cells are difficult to implement routinely in large clin ical studies because of the 
insufficient stability of plasma cells. For this reason, whole genome microarray analysis of 
sorted cellular fractions was used to develop a highly sensitiv e and specific gene expression 
signature comprised of multiple plasma cell-enriched genes. In Study MI-CP200, MEDI-551 
caused a statistically significant, dose-dependent depletion of  the plasma cell gene signature. 
Thus, it would be relevant to characterize the effect of MEDI-5 51 on plasma gene signature in 
patients with NMO/NMOSD. 
Subpopulations of CD19+ and CD20- B cells showing properties of  plasmablasts are 
increased selectively in the peripheral blood of NMO/NMOSD pati ents and anti-AQP4 
antibodies are produced by these cells. These B-cell subsets ha ve been shown to expand 
2 weeks prior to and during NMO/NMOSD attacks. Measuring the de pletion of plasma 
cells/plasmablasts will provide key PD information as MEDI-551 should deplete this cell 
population. The levels of the plasma cell signature prior to an d following MEDI-551 treatment 
may provide information about which patients are more likely to  respond to this therapy 
and/or predict an attack.  
Serum AQP4-IgG Titers 
Several previous studies determined that AQP4 antibody levels c orrelated with clinical disease 
activity, with relapses associated with up to a 3-fold increase  in AQP4 antibody titers ( Jarius 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 43 of 214 et al, 2008 ). Since CD19+ plasmablasts produce pathogenic anti-AQP4 antibo dies, it will be 
important to characterize the time course and extent of the eff ect of MEDI-551 on AQP4-IgG 
titers.  
3.2.4.4  Exploratory Investigations 
Levels of Soluble and Genomic Biomarkers (eg, Cytokines, Chemok ines, 
Immunoglobulins, and mRNA/Micro-RNA), and Relevant Cell Counts 
A number of biomarkers that may provide additional insights int o the mechanism of action of 
MEDI-551 in NMO/NMOSD or potentially predict response to MEDI-5 51 will be explored. 
An example of a relevant biomarker is BAFF, which is a cytokine  that acts as a potent 
activator of B cells and plays an important role in the prolife ration and differentiation of B 
cells. As the primary receptor for BAFF is expressed on mature B cells, it has been 
demonstrated that circulating BAFF is inversely correlated with  B-cell depletion. Other serum 
biomarkers such as CCL19 and CXCL13 are also related to B-cell dynamics and may predict 
responses to B-cell depleting therapies.  
T-cell Responses 
There is increasing evidence for the involvement of effector T cells in the pathogenesis of 
NMO (reviewed in Mitsdoerffer et al, 2013 ). AQP4-specific antibodies in NMO serum are 
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), a subclass of mature IgG that require s help from T cells. T cells 
from NMO patients demonstrated greater proliferation to AQP4 an d AQP4 peptide fragments 
than those from healthy controls ( Varrin-Doyer et al, 2012 ). Therefore, antigen-specific T 
cells may contribute to the generation of AQP4-IgG in the perip heral immune compartment 
and to the development of NMO lesions in the CNS.   
B-cell depletion, both ex vivo and in vivo, resulted in diminis hed 
proliferative and proinflammatory cytokine responses of both CD 4 and CD8 T cells of MS 
patients ( Bar-Or et al, 2010 ). It is mechanistically relevant to investigate whether T-cell  
responses are also diminished following B-cell depletion in NMO  patients. 
4 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
4.1 Subjects 
4.1.1 Number of Subjects 
A maximum of 252 subjects will be randomized and dosed in this study. Because this study is 
event-driven where the primary objective is based on a total of  67 AC-determined 
NMO/NMOSD attacks, and the rate of NMO/NMOSD attacks is not est ablished in the 
literature, this number of subjects was determined by analyzing  masked data of the actual 
attack rate from the first 78 subjects who completed the RCP in  this study. The attack status 
(attack/no attack) of the 78 subjects was randomly sampled with  different attack rate, which 
gave an estimate of the number of attacks for the total sample size. This simulation process 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 44 of 214 was repeated 10,000 times to give a distribution of the number of attacks for the total sample 
size, from which the probability of observing at least 67 attac ks could be estimated. Based on 
the 78 completed subjects, this procedure showed that with 252 subjects there is a 90% 
probability of reaching the required 67 AC-determined attacks. 
Of the total number of subjects enrolled, approximately 80% wil l be AQP4-IgG seropositive 
and 20% will be AQP4-IgG seronegative.  
4.1.2 Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects must meet all of the following criteria: 
1 Age 18 years or above at the time of screening.  
2 Written informed consent and any locally required authorization  (eg, Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] in the United States  of America (USA), 
European Union [EU] Data Privacy Directive in the EU) obtained from the subject/legal 
representative prior to performing any protocol-related procedu res, including screening 
evaluations 
3 One of the following: 
(a) Positive serum anti-AQP4-IgG result at screening (verified by t he allocated central 
laboratory) and a documented history of one or more NMO/NMOSD a cute relapses 
that required rescue therapy within the last year, or 2 or more  NMO/NMOSD acute 
relapses that required rescue therapy within 2 years prior to s creening; OR  
(b) Negative serum anti-AQP4-IgG result at screening (verified by t he allocated central 
laboratory) without evidence of brain lesion consistent with MS  and meets the 
clinical criteria for NMO according to Wingerchuk et al, 2006  and a documented 
history of one or more NMO acute relapses that required rescue therapy within the 
last year, or 2 or more NMO acute relapses that required rescue  therapy within 
2 years prior to screening. Note that data from AQP4-IgG serone gative subjects will 
be reviewed by an independent eligibility committee (see Sectio n 4.2.1.1) to confirm 
eligibility.  In the event that a subject has not received rescue therapy for  a relapse due to a 
misdiagnosis or mismanagement of symptoms at a practice or medi cal center outside 
of the investigator’s control, the subject may still be eligibl e for the study if, 
following a review of the relapse data, the medical monitor and  investigator are 
satisfied that the subject experienced a genuine relapse. 
4 Subjects who have had a relapse immediately prior to screening must have at least 4 
weeks in which their relapse symptoms are stable or improving p rior to randomization.  
5 Expanded Disability Status Scale score at randomization less th an or equal to 7.5. A 
score of 8.0 may be eligible if the investigator and medical mo nitor assess that the 
subject is reasonably able to participate in the study

partner must use a highly effective method of contraception (su bjects in the Czech 
Republic only must use 1 additional method of contraception) fr om screening, and must 
agree to continue using such precautions for 6 months after the  final dose of 
investigational product; cessation of contraception after this point should be discussed 
with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm m ethod, and the 
withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
(a) Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile 
(ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or compl ete hysterectomy) or 
those who are not postmenopausal (per International Council for  Harmonisation 
[ICH] M3(R2) 11.2: defined as 12 months with no menses without an alternative 
medical cause) 
(b) A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one th at results in a low 
failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently  and correctly. The 
acceptable highly effective methods of contraception are descri bed in Table 4. 
7 Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female partn er of childbearing 
potential must use a male condom plus spermicide (subjects in t he Czech Republic only 
must use 1 additional method of contraception) (see  Table 4) from Day 1 for 3 months 
after receipt of the final dose of investigational product. Bec ause male condom and 
spermicide is not a highly effective contraception method, it i s strongly recommended 
that female partners of male subjects to also use a highly effe ctive method of 
contraception throughout this period.  
8 Sterilized males, without the appropriate post-vasectomy docume ntation on the absence 
of sperm in the ejaculate, who are sexually active with a femal e partner of childbearing 
potential must use a condom and spermicide from Day 1 for 3 mon ths after receipt of the 
final dose of investigational product.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 49 of 214 4.1.4 Subject Enrollment and Randomization 
4.1.4.1  Enrollment 
Study participation begins (ie, a subject is “enrolled”) once w ritten informed consent is 
obtained and a subject identification (SID) number is assigned by a central system (eg, an 
interactive voice/web response system, IVRS/IWRS). Thereafter, the screening evaluations 
may begin to assess study eligibility (inclusion/exclusion) cri teria. The SID number will be 
used to identify the subject during the screening process and t hroughout study participation, if 
applicable.  
A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at th e site and will document all 
screening failures (ie, subjects who are consented but do not m eet study eligibility criteria 
and/or are not randomized), including the reason(s) for screeni ng failure. 
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria (ie,  screening failures) should not, 
under any circumstances, be randomized (if applicable) or recei ve investigational product. 
There can be no exceptions to this rule. Subjects who are scree ning failures should be 
withdrawn from the study; however, they may be re-screened once  in the event that the 
investigator believes that the subject will subsequently meet a ll eligibility criteria. Subjects 
who are rescreened will be assigned a new SID number.  
Enrollment into the study will stop when one of the following o ccurs: 
1 A total of 67 AC-determined NMOSD attacks have occurred 
2 252 subjects have been randomized and dosed 
3 Recommendation by the independent DMC to cease enrollment 
 
Informed Consent Requirements 
Before enrolling into the study, all subjects must review, unde rstand, and sign the ICF. The 
ICF will include detailed explanations and risk:benefit expecta tions from the study and will 
provide subjects and investigators the opportunity to discuss a ppropriate risk estimation and to 
fully understand the risks and potential benefits of this study . Study procedures may only be 
performed after written informed consent is obtained. Reconsent  will only be required if a 
subject fails screening and is subsequently rescreened. Subject s may be rescreened only once.  
In addition, subjects will also be required to consent to the u se of their medical data and 
biological samples. 
All subjects who enter the OLP will be required to review and s ign a specific ICF that 
highlights the risks and potential benefits of participating in  the OLP.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 50 of 214 Subjects may give optional consent for collection of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample 
for genetic and future research (see Section 4.1.8). 
4.1.4.2  Randomization Process 
An IVRS/IWRS will be used for randomization to a treatment grou p and assignment of 
masked investigational product kit numbers. A subject is consid ered randomized into the 
study when the investigator notifies the IVRS/IVWS that a subje ct meets eligibility criteria 
and the IVRS/IVWS provides the assignment of masked investigati onal product kit numbers 
for the subject.  
4.1.5 Withdrawal from the Study 
Subjects are at any time free to withdraw from the study (inves tigational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment (withdrawa l of consent). Such subjects 
will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of an y AEs.  
Subjects in the RCP who express a wish to prematurely discontin ue from the study will be 
followed for protocol-specified assessments until Day 197, unle ss consent is withdrawn 
specifically for further study participation. In this case the subject will complete the SFP 
unless the subject is lost to follow up, or the subject is enro lled in another clinical study. 
Subjects who discontinue from the OLP will enter the SFP, if po ssible. 
In the Czech Republic only, subjects may discontinue from the i nvestigational product and, 
following an Early Discontinuation Visit (EDV), subjects will e nter the SFP if they agree to 
this safety follow up; unless the subject is lost to follow up,  or the subject is enrolled in 
another clinical study. 
Diaries and all study medications should be returned by the sub ject. If a subject withdraws 
consent from further participation in the study, then no furthe r study visits or data collection 
should take place. 
A subject’s decision to withdraw from treatment must be documen ted in the source 
documents.  
4.1.6 Discontinuation of Investigational Product 
An individual subject will not receive any further investigatio nal product if any of the 
following occur in the subject in question: 
1 Withdrawal of consent for further treatment with investigationa l product or the subject is 
lost to follow-up 
2 An AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or the Sponsor, contraindicates further

following consultation with the medical monitor (see Section 4. 7.2).  
11 Noncompliance to the study protocol as judged by the investigat or and/or the Sponsor 
 
Subjects who are permanently discontinued from receiving invest igational product will be 
followed for protocol-specified assessments including follow-up  of any AEs unless consent is 
withdrawn specifically for further study participation (Section  4.1.5), the subject is lost to 
follow-up, or the subject is enrolled in another clinical study . 
4.1.7 Replacement of Subjects 
Dropout in the RCP will not be adjusted by replacing subjects.  
4.1.8 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples 
Biological Samples Obtained for the Main Study 
Study data are protected by the use of an SID number, which is a number specific to the 
subject. The investigator is in control of the information that  is needed to connect a study 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 52 of 214 sample to a subject. A subject’s consent to the use of data doe s not have a specific expiration 
date, but the subject may withdraw consent at any time by notif ying the investigator. If 
consent is withdrawn, any samples collected prior to that time may still be given to and used 
by the Sponsor but no new data or samples will be collected unl ess specifically required to 
monitor safety of the subject. 
Samples Obtained for Genetic Research and Future Research 
Samples obtained for genetic research and future research will be labeled with a sample 
identification number but will not be labeled with personal ide ntifiers such as the subject’s 
name. A file linking this sample identification number with the  SID number will be kept in a 
secure place at the Sponsor with restricted access. If the subj ect withdraws consent for 
participating in genetic research and future research, this lin k will allow the Sponsor to locate 
the subject’s sample and destroy it. The coding of samples and results is to ensure that these 
research results are kept confidential by keeping the subject’s  identity and these results 
separate.  
If the subject consents to have his/her samples used for geneti c research and future research, 
this additional research may not start immediately and may star t at any time during the storage 
period. The subject’s sample(s) including any specimens of extr acted DNA will be stored by 
the Sponsor with similar samples from other subjects at a secur e central laboratory. The 
subject’s samples will not be kept for more than 25 years after  the end of the study in which 
they were collected. If the subject chooses not to allow his/he r study samples to be used for 
genetic research and future research, the samples will be destr oyed by the Sponsor once they 
are no longer required for the main study. 
If consent is withdrawn after a sample has been taken but befor e the subject’s sample is sent to 
the Sponsor for genetic research and future research, the inves tigator will arrange to have it 
destroyed. If consent is withdrawn after the subject’s sample(s ) have been sent to the Sponsor 
for genetic research and future research, the Sponsor and the i nvestigator will ensure that these 
sample(s) are destroyed unless the sample identification number  has been removed and the 
subject can no longer be linked to any sample(s). However, if t he subject’s samples have 
already been used for research, the Sponsor is not required to destroy results of this research. 
In this case only the remaining sample(s) will be destroyed. 
4.2 Schedule of Study Procedures 
4.2.1 Enrollment/Screening Period 
Table 5 shows all procedures to be conducted at the screening v isit. The screening period will 
be up to 28 days, unless otherwise noted below, and all screeni ng procedures must be 
completed within this time period. Screening assessments are pr esented in Table 5 and may be 
performed in any order following the signing of the informed co nsent.

10 days of Day 1 that are also required at Day 1, these do not need to be repeated.  
The screening period may be extended by up to 28 days to allow for repeat procedures and to 
allow results for protocol-specified procedures and processes ( including the eligibility review) 
to be obtained. However, if the subject cannot be assessed with in the defined screening period, 
the subject must be withdrawn and screen failed. In addition, a ny subject who experiences an 
NMO/NMOSD relapse in screening up to and prior to randomization , should be screen failed 
to allow appropriate management of the relapse. Such subjects c annot be rescreened for at 
least 28 days from the completion of the treatment for the NMO/ NMOSD relapse. 
In the event a subject is re-screened a full neuroaxis MRI need  not be repeated if the previous 
study neuroaxis MRI was conducted within the 3 months prior to the rescreening visit. 
Any subject who is a screen failure may be rescreened once, unl ess the need to maintain the 
80:20 ratio of AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects to AQP4-IgG seron egative subjects prevents 
them from being randomized. In exceptional circumstances an add itional re-screening may be 
permitted, this must be documented by the Principal Investigato r and is subject to approval by 
the medical monitor.  
In the event screening is extended, blood samples for serum che mistry and hematology must 
be redrawn within the 28 days prior to randomization.  
Written informed consent and any locally required privacy act d ocument authorization must 
be obtained prior to performing any protocol-specific procedure s, including screening 
evaluations.  
Subjects undergoing screening at the time when the 252nd subject is randomized and dosed, 
subjects undergoing screening at the time the 67th AC determined attack occurs, and subjects 
undergoing screening at the time enrollment is terminated for a ny other reason, will not be 
randomized.

4.2.1.1  Eligibility Committee 
Three experts in NMO/NMOSD disease will constitute the independ ent Eligibility Committee. 
This committee has the mandate to evaluate the screening visit and medical history data from 
all subjects who have an AQP4-IgG seronegative result from the central lab and determine 
whether the subject meets the Wingerchuk et al, 2006  criteria for NMO. The committee will 
use its judgement and clinical experience to make its determina tion based on the data 
provided. The committee’s role, function, and procedures are go verned by a separate charter.  
4.2.2 Treatment Period 
4.2.2.1  Randomized-controlled Treatment Period 
Randomization will occur on Day 1 (within 28 days of the start of screening, unless screening 
is extended as noted above). Table 6 shows all procedures to be  conducted during the 
Randomized-controlled treatment period. Patient-reported outcom es should be done first 
followed by all other assessments/procedures in an order determ ined by the site. All 
procedures must be completed prior to administration of investi gational product. If necessary, 
the randomization visit may be split over 2 days, in this case randomization and 
investigational product administration must occur on the second  day. If a subject discontinues 
from the study early during the RCP, all procedures should be c onducted as presented in 
Table 6 for the Day 197/ EDV. If a subject withdraws from the s tudy, every attempt should be 
made to have the subject come to the site to conduct EDV assess ments.  
If a subject withdraws during a scheduled study visit, that vis it will change to an EDV and 
procedures should be conducted according to those presented for  Day 197/EDV. Following an 
EDV, all subjects should continue into the SFP.  
At the time 67 AC-determined attacks have occurred or when enro llment is discontinued upon 
recommendation of the independent DMC based on evidence of effi cacy and safety, the 
sponsor will notify all sites and the sites will notify all sub jects who are in the RCP that these 
subjects must discontinue the RCP as soon as possible, preferab ly within 14 days, and should 
be given the option to enroll into the OLP. Procedures should b e conducted as presented in 
Table 6 for the Day 197/ EDV; however, subjects who have had an  MRI in the last 3 months 
need NOT repeat the MRI. Subjects who decide to enroll into the  OLP will follow the 
procedures of the OLP presented in Table 7.

Table 7 shows all procedures to be conducted during the OLP. Pa tient-reported outcomes 
should be done first followed by all other assessments/procedur es in an order determined by 
the site. For subjects completing Day 197 of the RCP, Day 1 of the OLP should be the same 
day; however, it may be delayed for up to 14 days (procedures d o not need to be repeated). 
Subjects are not permitted to enter the OLP after 14 days, unle ss there is a compelling reason 
that is discussed with, and agreed to by the medical monitor, i n which case a short extension 
may be granted.  
Subjects who experience an AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack durin g the RCP must enter 
the OLP within 28 days of the site receiving confirmation of th e attack from the AC. Entering 
subjects into the OLP beyond the 28 days from the AC confirmati on should be discussed with 
the medical monitor. Procedures that were done during the last visit can be used for Day 1 of 
the OLP if this occurs within 14 days from the Assessment Visit . Otherwise, procedures 
required for OLP Day 1 should be performed. 
Subjects who are in the RCP at the time the 67th AC-determined attack occurs, or when 
enrollment is discontinued upon recommendation of the independe nt DMC based on evidence 
of efficacy and safety, and wish to enroll in the OLP, should d o so as soon as possible, 
preferably within 14 days. Consulation with the medical monitor  is advised in cases where the 
transition to the OLP is not completed within 14 days. 
Administration of MEDI-551 will start on OLP Day 1. 
The OLP will continue for a minimum of 1 year after the last su bject enters and a maximum 
of 3 years (after the last subject enters), or until regulatory  approval for MEDI-551 in the 
participating country, or until the Sponsor discontinues develo pment of MEDI-551 in this 
indication, whichever occurs first. All subjects entering the O LP will be required to reconsent 
prior to receiving MEDI-551. Subjects can choose to exit the OL P at any time, for any reason, 
including seeking alternative treatment options, at which point  they will enter the SFP (unless 
consent is withdrawn). 
If a subject discontinues from the OLP, all procedures should b e conducted as presented in 
Table 7 for the Day 365/EDV. If a subject withdraws from the st udy, every attempt should be 
made to have the subject come to the site to conduct EDV assess ments. Following the EDV, 
the subject will enter the SFP (Section 4.2.4).  
If a subject withdraws during a scheduled study visit, that vis it will change to an EDV and 
procedures should be conducted according to those presented for  Day 365/EDV for the OLP.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 64 of 214 4.2.3 Study Procedures for Assessment Visit 
Table 8 shows all study procedures to be conducted at Assessmen t Visits for subjects 
experiencing new or worsening symptom(s) potentially related to  NMO/NMOSD. An 
Assessment Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible and wi thin 72 hours of symptom 
report. Procedures to determine whether symptoms are related to  NMO/NMOSD should be 
conducted first, followed by procedures for determination of an  NMO/NMOSD attack. All 
clinical assessments need to be documented with time and date, and the order of the 
assessments should be determined by the nature of the suspected  attack (eg, EDSS before 
Independent ophthalmology in case of myelitis symptoms). An MRI  of all domains should be 
performed as part of an Assessment Visit and can be done at any  time during the Assessment 
Visit. The order of the MRI domains performed can be determined  by the nature of the 
suspected attack. MRI images/study report should not be reviewe d by the Principal 
Investigator unless a specific criterion for an attack requires  review of the MRI. In such cases 
review of the MRI image MUST be done AFTER the review of all re levant clinical 
assessment data (eg, EDSS in the case of myelitis/brainstem/bra in symptoms or 
ophthalmology in the case of optic neuritis symptoms) is comple ted. Assessments should be 
concluded as soon as possible, but should not extend beyond 4 d ays from Day 1 of the 
Assessment Visit. 
If the investigator determines that the new or worsening sympto m(s) are not related to 
NMO/NMOSD, then the independent assessments (EDSS, Independent ophthalmology, and 
MRI) are not required.

Following the diagnosis of an attack by the Principal Investiga tor, the attack symptoms and 
findings may get worse. In this case, the assessments and manag ement will be done in 
accordance with the standard of care at the site. The change in  symptoms/findings, 
assessments completed, and treatments administered should all b e recorded in the electronic 
case report form (eCRF).  
4.2.5 Study Procedures for Attack Follow-up Visit 
Subjects who experience an NMO/NMOSD attack that meets the prot ocol-defined criteria and 
requires rescue treatment, regardless of the outcome of the AC review, will undergo an Attack 
Follow-up Visit. Table 9 shows procedures to be conducted for t he Attack Follow-up Visit. 
Patient reported outcomes should be done first followed by all other assessments/procedures 
in an order determined by the site. An Attack Follow-up Visit s hould be conducted 28 days 
from Day 1 of the Assessment Visit. This visit may correspond w ith an OLP or SFP visit or 
may be scheduled separately.

4.3.1.1  Identification, Assessment, and Adjudication of an NMO/NMOSD At tack  
Overview 
The process for identifica tion, assessment, and adjudication of  an NMO/NMOSD attack is 
presented in Figure 3 and requires that subjects reporting a ne w or worsening symptom(s) of a 
potential NMO/NMOSD attack must  be evaluated at an Assessment V isit at the clinical site 
by the investigator as soon as possible, but within 72 hours of  the report. Following the start of 
the Assessment Visit, the proce dures required to diagnose an NM O/NMOSD attack per the 
protocol-defined attack criteri a must be completed within a tot al of 5 days following the start 
of the Assessment Visit.

Period.  
 
The Assessment Visit is designe d to determine if an attack per the protocol criteria has 
occurred. There are two main outco mes of the Assessment Visit: 

MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 70 of 214 1 The investigator determines that the symptoms ARE related to NM O/NMOSD and 
completes the full attack assessment. In this case specified da ta generated at the 
Assessment Visit, regardless of whether or not the investigator  determined that a 
protocol-defined NMO/NMOSD attack has occurred, will be submitt ed to the AC for a 
real-time review.  
2 The investigator determines that the symptoms ARE NOT related t o NMO/NMOSD. In 
this case the data related to the assessment of the symptoms wi ll also be sent to the AC 
for review (not in real time).  
 
The adjudication process requires that adjudication will be com pleted within a total of 14 days 
(+ 3 days) of the start of the Assessment Visit. The determinat ion of the AC as to whether an 
NMO/NMOSD attack has occurred will be communicated to the clini cal site. Only subjects 
where their attack was determined by the AC will be eligible to  enroll into the OLP. 
Rescue therapy for an NMO/NMOSD attack will be given by the inv estigator according to the 
investigator’s clinical judgment that the subject is experienci ng an NMO/NMOSD attack. 
Rescue therapy will not be affected by the AC decision as to wh ether the NMO/NMOSD 
attack has or has not been determined. Subjects who receive res cue therapy for an 
NMO/NMOSD attack that was determined by the AC will have the op tion to enroll into the 
OLP. Subjects whose attack was not determined by the AC will ha ve the option to continue in 
the RCP.  
There may be an interval of a few days between the completion o f the rescue therapy and the 
completion of the adjudication process. This period probably do es not present a safety concern 
(possible NMO/NMOSD attack) as the rescue therapy would have on ly just concluded, and 
the effects of the rescue therapy will cover the period before the OLP starts. 
Detailed Procedures 
Identification 
There are 3 possibilities for identifying new or worsening symp toms that may relate to an 
NMO/NMOSD attack:  
x The subject reports the symptom directly to the site 
x A symptom is identified during a study visit 
x A symptom is identified during the telephone call every 2 weeks  to the subject 
 Telephone Calls to Subjects 
The investigator or designee will contact all subjects by telep hone every 2 weeks, 
commencing from Day 43 of the RCP through the end of the subjec t’s participation in the 
RCP (except where timing coincides with study visit weeks).  
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 71 of 214 The purpose of these calls is to assess for any signs and/or sy mptoms of an NMO/NMOSD 
attack (examples of possible symptoms are presented in Table 11 ). The calls will follow a 
prespecified script.  
If the investigator suspects an NMO/NMOSD attack or impending a ttack, an Assessment Visit 
will be scheduled within 72 hours. 
Recording Symptoms of NMO/NMOSD 
Details of any symptoms of NMO/NMOSD that occur or worsen durin g the study will be 
recorded at the Assessment Visit. Any symptom determined as not  related to NMO/NMOSD 
should be reported as an AE.  
Information regarding new or worsening symptoms may be provided  during study visits 
(including follow-up by the site owing to a missed study visit) , during scheduled bi-weekly 
telephone calls, or from spontaneous reporting from the subject  at any time during the study.  
In any of the above situations, information will be elicited fr om the subjects as to whether they 
have had any changes in their NMO/NMOSD status since the last c ontact with the site. A 
standardized worksheet will be used by all sites in order to el icit consistent information in the 
same manner. 
If the investigator suspects an NMO/NMOSD attack or impending a ttack, an Assessment Visit 
will be scheduled within 72 hours.  
Information to be recorded at the Assessment Visit includes the  following: date of contact, 
each symptom, date and time of onset, date of resolution, treat ment administered, date of 
assessment visit scheduled, and whether the symptom was not rel ated to NMO/NMOSD but to 
an AE, or an SAE (see Section 5.5, Reporting of Serious Adverse  Events). 
Assessment Visit 
The investigator initially conducts a physical and neurological  examination as described in 
Section 4.3.3.2. If the symptom(s) is assessed by the investiga tor as not related  to 
NMO/NMOSD, an AE must be reported (see Section 5.4) and the sub ject will continue in the 
RCP or the OLP, as applicable, without further action. The data  related to the assessment of 
the symptoms that were determined by the investigator as not re lated to NMO/NMOSD will 
be sent to the AC for non-real-time review. 
If the symptom(s) is assessed as related to NMO/NMOSD, full ass essment of the potential 
NMO/NMOSD attack will be conducted and the investigator will de termine if an attack 
fulfilling the protocol-defined criteria for an NMO/NMOSD attac k has occurred (Table 11). 
The date and time of all clinical assessments, conducted by the  independent assessors, must be 
documented, and the order of the assessments should be driven b y the nature of the suspected

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 72 of 214 attack (eg, EDSS before Independent ophthalmology in case of my elitis symptoms). MRI of 
all domains should be performed as part of an Assessment Visit and can be done at any time 
during the Assessment Visit. The order of the MRI domains perfo rmed can be determined by 
the nature of the suspected attack. MRI images/study report sho uld not be reviewed by the 
Principal Investigator unless a specific criterion for an attac k requires review of the MRI.  
Following completion of the independent clinical assessment, th e Principal Investigator 
should decide if any of the CLINICAL (without MRI) criteria (nu mbers 1 to 8, 12 and 13) are 
met. Within one domain (optic nerve, spinal cord, brain or brai nstem), the clinical criterion 
with the most significant change should be selected. Only in ca ses where none of the 
CLINICAL criteria are met, criteria that include MRI review can  be selected (numbers 9 to 
11, 14 to 18). Only in this situation is MRI review of the rele vant domain allowed.  
If the attack presents in more than one domain (optic nerve, sp inal cord, brain or brainstem), 
more than one criterion can be selected.

Every effort should be made to ini tiate rescue therapy only aft er full assessment is conducted 
and the NMO/NMOSD attack has been diagnosed in accordance with the protocol-defined 
criteria. However, the investigators can at any time decide to initiate rescue therapy if, in their 
clinical judgment, the subject  will be at unacceptable risk if such therapy is not immediately 
initiated. 
Adjudication Process (For Attacks Occurring During the RCP) 
The entire data generated during the Assessment Visit of the po tential attack will be provided 
to the AC upon completion of the  assessment. The adjudication p rocess will be completed 
when the AC makes their final  decision, which will occur in a t otal of 14 days (+ 3 days) from 
the start of the Assessment Visit.

x Description of the new or worsening symptom 
x Findings of physical and neurological examination 
x Relevant laboratory test results 
x Relevant x-ray studies, if performed in relation to the assessm ent 
x Expanded Disability Status Scale score as determined by the ind ependent assessor

The data set will be provided to the independent AC by the vend or according to the 
Adjudication Committee Charter (see Section 4.3.1.5). 
The AC will not be provided with the Principal Investigator’s o pinion of whether an 
NMO/NMOSD attack has occurred, nor will the AC receive informat ion about which protocol 
attack criterion was met or whether a rescue medication was pro vided. 
The decision by the AC will be communicated to the Principal In vestigator at the clinical site. 
At this point the following scenarios will be possible: 
1 Subjects for whom the NMO/NMOSD attack was determined by the AC  will have the 
option to enter the OLP. If the subject decides not to enter th e OLP, the subject will then

The data to be adjudicated will be provided to the independent AC by the vendor according to 
the Adjudication Committee Charter (see Section 4.3.1.5).  
Regardless of the decision made by the AC, the subject may choo se to continue in the OLP or

4.3.1.2  Neuroaxis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan 
MRI for All Subjects 
All subjects will have a full neuroaxis MRI scan, including opt ic nerve, spinal cord, and brain 
performed at screening to determine eligibility and establish a  baseline (see Section 4.2.1). In 
the event a subject is re-screened a full neuroaxis MRI need no t be repeated if the previous 
study neuroaxis MRI was conducted within the 3 months prior to the rescreening visit. A 
neuroaxis MRI scan will be repeated at 28 weeks in subjects who  complete the RCP without 
having experienced an NMO/NMOSD attack. Subjects who discontinu e the RCP due to the 
occurrence of the 67th AC-determined attack who have had an MRI in the last 3 months need 
NOT repeat the MRI. During the OLP, neuroaxis MRI scans will be  performed every 52 
weeks. All MRI scans will be centrally read and data collected for analysis at the end of the 
study. 
The Principal Investigator at the site should not use these MRI s for any clinical decision 
making, but review of the brain MRI is acceptable if there is a  safety alert from the central 
MRI reader indicating the presence of a new lesion(s). 
MRI for NMO/NMOSD Attacks 
In addition to the scheduled MRIs, at the time of any Assessmen t Visit, a full neuroaxis MRI 
scan will be performed of all domains. These scans will be sent  for a central reading and data 
will be collected for analysis at the end of the study. MRI ima ges/study report obtained during 
an Assessment Visit should not be reviewed by the Principal Inv estigator unless a specific 
criterion for an attack requires review of the MRI (Table 11). In such cases review of the MRI 
image and local report MUST be done AFTER the review of all rel evant clinical assessment 
data is complete.   
The Principal Investigator at the site should not use these MRI s for any clinical decision 
making. Additionally, the Principal Investigator should NOT use  the MRI to make any 
decisions regarding the potential severity of an NMO/NMOSD atta ck; rather it should only be 
used to confirm the clinical presentation. The MRI scan will al so be read centrally, and the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 80 of 214 central report and image will be used by the AC for the adjudic ation of the NMO/NMOSD 
attack.  
Neuroaxis MRI Documentation and Assessment 
All MRI scans are to be performed at the study site. To ensure that MRI scans are of 
acceptable quality for viewing the optic nerve, spinal cord, an d brain, the settings and 
procedures (specified by the central reader) to be used for the  MRI scanners are mandated at a 
minimum standard and defined in the MRI Imaging Manual (provide d separately). The site 
will be required to perform a qualification MRI scan to send to  the central reading site to 
ensure compliance with the requirements for the study. Qualific ation MRI scans may require 
consenting a volunteer subject from the investigative site, dep ending on local Institutional 
Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) requirements. 
All MRI images from the site will be date and time stamped and sent to the central imaging 
vendor that is independent of the study sites. The images will be read by 2 independent neuro-
radiologists at the central reading site for a consensus read a nd central reporting.  The MRI 
reports and scans produced as part of the protocol-defined crit eria for an NMO/NMOSD 
attack will be sent from the central reading site to the AC as part of the assessment data to be 
adjudicated.  
4.3.1.3  Independent Ophthalmology Assessments 
The protocol-defined ophthalmology assessment will consist of a  high- and low-contrast 
visual acuity test, and assessment for relative afferent pupill ary defect (RAPD).  
All examinations must be conducted by an ophthalmologist or ano ther site member with 
appropriate training and experience who is independent of the i nvestigator and the subject. If 
possible, the same person should review a single subject throug h every ophthalmology 
assessment. The data generated from the ophthalmology assessmen ts will be entered directly 
into an electronic data capture device provided to the site wit h a date and time stamp. In order 
to minimize bias, the ophthalmology examiner will not have acce ss to prior visual acuity 
scores or RAPD findings at the time of a new evaluation. The op hthalmology examiner will 
be instructed NOT to elicit or discuss the subjects’ experience s or AEs on the study.  
Ophthalmology assessments will be completed at screening, Day 1 , at scheduled study visits, 
and Assessment Visits, according to the schedule of procedures in Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, 
Table 8, and Table 9.  
In the event that a subject has new or worsening symptoms relat ed to NMO/NMOSD, all 
ophthalmology assessments will also be performed at an Assessme nt Visit.  
The ophthalmology examiner will provide a full report of the ex amination findings, in 
accordance with protocol-defined parameters, to the investigato r to review against a subject’s

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 81 of 214 previous reports and to determine if the findings meet 1 or mor e of the protocol-defined 
criteria for ON attack. 
Visual Acuity Assessments 
For the purposes of this study, visual acuity will be measured using Landolt C Broken Ring 
Chart (both high and low contrast). Best-corrected monocular an d binocular vision will be 
tested. 
Visual acuity tests are used to determine the smallest characte rs that can be read on a 
standardized chart. The Landolt C Broken Ring Chart has a stand ardized format designed to 
be equally detectable for normal observers consisting of an inc omplete ring resembling the 
letter “C.” The width of the break and the ring are each one-fi fth of its overall diameter. The 
subject must indicate where the break is located, the break bei ng positioned in any direction. 
Each line has 5 rings and the spacing between the rings and the  lines is proportional to the ring 
size. The change in visual acuity from one line to the next occ urs in equal logarithmic steps. 
To standardize the method of assessment, the charts must be use d in a retro-illuminated Early 
Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) cabinet to elimina te the need for 
standardization of height and room lighting.  
Charts and wheeled light cabinets will be supplied to all sites .  
To ensure consistency of visual acuity testing across subjects and study sites, the following 
set-up and procedures are required: 
Low-contrast Visual Acuity 
x Charts must be used with a retro-illuminated ETDRS cabinet 
x Use a well-lit room, but one not exposed to full sunlight to no t distract from the subject’s 
normal eyesight 
x Use overhead lights to provide an even distribution of light ac ross the room 
x Prevent distractions and limit movement in the room 
x Position the subject at a distance of 3 meters  from the chart 
x Test best-corrected monocular and binocular vision 
x Ask the subject to describe the top line of the chart from left  to right. Record the number 
of rings that the subject successfully describes as the subject  describes them. If subject 
cannot easily read the rings, ask the subject to guess.  
x Ask the subject to continue reading each subsequent line below the top line until the 
subject reaches a line where all the rings cannot be made out. Record the number of rings 
that the subject successfully describes as the subject reads th em  
x Compare the subject’s results against the actual rings on each line of the chart 
x The last line the subject is able to see and read correctly det ermines the score

Assessment of Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect 
For the purposes of this study, RAPD will be assessed by the “s winging light test,” a method 
of detecting differences between the two eyes in how the pupils  respond to light shone in one 
eye at a time. This test must be administered by an ophthalmolo gist or another site member 
with appropriate training and experience (ie, not the investiga tor) and in accordance with 
standard of care at the institution. If possible, the same opht halmology examiner should 
review a single subject through every assessment. 
The RAPD test can be useful in detecting unilateral or asymmetr ic disease of the retina or 
optic nerve. The physiological basis of the test is that in hea lthy eyes the reaction of the pupils 
in the left and right eyes are linked; that is, a bright light shone in one eye will lead to equal 
constriction of both pupils. A RAPD is present if the initial c onsensual pupillary constriction 
is greater than the initial direct pupillary constriction.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 83 of 214 The following procedures are recommended: 
x Perform the test in a semi-darkened room. If the room is too da rk it will be difficult to 
observe pupil responses, particularly in heavy pigmented eyes 
x Use a bright torch such as a small flashlight that can be focus ed to provide a narrow, even 
beam of light 
x Ask the subject to focus on a distant object and keep looking a t it – use a chart or picture 
as an object of focus 
x Move the flashlight from side to side so the beam of light shin es directly into each eye. 
Do not swing the beam from side to side around a central axis ( eg, by holding it in front 
of the subject’s nose) as this can stimulate the near response 
x Keep the light source at the same distance from each eye to ens ure the light stimulus is 
equally bright in both 
x Keep the beam of light steadily on the first eye for at least 3  seconds to allow the pupil 
size to stabilize. Note whether the pupil of the eye being illu minated reacts briskly and 
constricts fully to the light. Also note the response in the ot her eye – does it also constrict 
briskly? 
x Move the light quickly to shine in the opposite eye. Hold the l ight steady for at least 
3 seconds. Note whether the pupil of the eye being illuminated stays the same size, or 
whether it gets bigger. Note the response in the opposite eye.  
x Repeat the test, observing the response of the pupils of both e yes when one and then the 
other is illuminated. 
 
The RAPD results will be reported as follows: 
x Date and time of examination 
x Presence or absence or loss of RAPD in either eye 
x If RAPD is present, record pupillary responses on a scale of 1+  to 5+ for each eye 
according to the criteria in Table 12.

4.3.1.4  Expanded Disability Status Scale and Functional Systems Scores 
The EDSS and its associated FSS provide a system for quantifyin g disability and monitoring 
changes in the level of disability over time. The EDSS scores a nd FSS will be captured and 
date and time stamped using electronic data capture. Standardiz ed guidance for the assessment 
of the EDSS and FSS has been developed, including a set of defi nitions for the EDSS and 
FSS. The latest version of the EDSS/FSS is version 04/10.2, whi ch will be used in this study 
(Kappos et al, 2015 ; Kurtzke, 1983; D’Souza et al, 2016 ). 
The EDSS ranges from 0 (normal neurological exam) to 10 (death from MS), with half steps 
from 1.0 to 9.5. Increasing values represent a higher grade of impairment and disability. The 
EDSS steps 1.0 to 5.0 refer to patients with MS who are able to  walk without any aid and are 
defined more by the results of the 7 Functional Systems (FS; Vi sual FS, Brainstem FS, 
Pyramidal FS, Cerebellar FS, Sensory FS, Bowel and Bladder FS, and Cerebral FS). Each FS 
is structured in grades from 0 to 5 or 6 (only the Visual FS ha s a maximal grade 4 after 
conversion). The EDSS steps Ӌ 5.5 are exclusively defined by the ability to ambulate, the 
assistance required, or the use of a wheelchair. The EDSS and F SS are provided in    
Appendix 4. 
The EDSS assessment will be completed at screening, Day 1 of th e RCP, at scheduled study 
visits, and Assessment Visits, according to the schedule of pro cedures in Table 5, Table 6, 
Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9. The assessment must be conducted  by a trained and certified 
neurologist (so called EDSS examiner) who is independent of the  treating physician (so called 
investigator) and the subject. A back-up EDSS examiner must be available so that EDSS 
assessments can be made at the time of an NMO/NMOSD attack. The  same EDSS examiner 
should perform the assessment for individual subjects for the d uration of the study to ensure 
consistency with assessment, if possible. MedImmune will provid e training to all EDSS 
examining investigators and collect documented evidence of trai ning prior to allowing 
administration of the EDSS for the purposes of the study. The d ata generated from the 
examination will be captured electronically. In order to minimi ze bias, the EDSS examiner 
will not have access to prior EDSS/FSS at the time of a new eva luation. The EDSS examiner 
will be instructed NOT to elicit or discuss the subject’s exper iences or AEs on the study.  
4.3.1.5  Independent Adjudication Committee 
Three experts in NMO/NMOSD disease will constitute the independ ent AC. This committee 
has the mandate to evaluate each data set that is generated dur ing the Assessment Visit and 
determine if an NMO/NMOSD attack occurred based on the clinical  presentation, 
assessments, and the protocol-defined criteria for an NMO/NMOSD  attack. The committee is 
completely independent and blinded to treatment assignments and /or to pertinent treatment

subjects, and to any decision made by the Principal Investigato r regarding an NMO/NMOSD 
attack. The committee will use its judgement and clinical exper ience to make its determination 
based on the data provided. The committee will review the same data that are available to the 
Principal Investigator when he/she makes his/her determination about the attack. In 
exceptional cases, determined and justified by the committee as  such, the committee can 
request to review additional data that is essential to make a d etermination. The committee’s 
role, function and procedures are governed by a separate charte r.  
The data from all subjects who are assessed at an Assessment Vi sit due to a new symptom(s) 
or worsening of an existing symptom(s) related to NMO/NMOSD wil l be sent for adjudication 
by the AC regardless of whether the Principal Investigator has determined that an 
NMO/NMOSD attack has occurred. Furthermore, the AC will not rec eive information about 
which protocol attack criterion was met and the rescue medicati on utilized.  
Determination of an NMO/NMOSD attack by the AC is for the purpo se of determining which 
events will be included in the primary analysis. It will NOT af fect the rescue therapy that a 
subject may receive.   
Only subjects in whom the attack was determined by the AC will be given the option to enter 
the OLP.  
In addition, the data set that was generated and used by the Pr incipal Investigator to assess the 
symptom(s) that were determined not to be related to NMO/NMOSD in the RCP, will be 
delivered to the AC for a non-real-time review. 
4.3.1.6  Healthcare Resource Utilization 
The Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) information is colle cted to quantify the impact 
of disease and treatment on the subject’s scheduled and medical  facility visits. The HCRU 
information related to NMO/NMOSD will be elicited using a subje ct diary.  
At each scheduled study visit, all subjects will be provided wi th a paper diary and asked to 
complete these for the duration of their participation in the s tudy. At each visit, the diary will 
be returned to the site and the data will be reviewed by the in vestigator. The diary will 
constitute source data and will be retained by the site. 
In-patient hospitalization, for the purposes of analysis of the  secondary endpoint, is defined as 
a stay in a hospital that goes beyond midnight of the first day  of admission. Any duration of 
stay (calculated as the difference between discharge date and a dmission date) of more than 1 
day will contribute to this endpoint. This includes the time a subject may enter an emergency 
department plus subsequent admission to a ward. Hospitalization s for the administration of 
NMO-related medications or procedures only (ie, the administrat ion or procedure was isolated 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 86 of 214 and not provided during a subject’s hospitalization due to NMO for another reason) will not 
be included in the secondary endpoint analysis. 
Information will be collected throughout the RCP and the OLP on  all NMO/NMOSD-related 
HCRU visits as presented in Table 13.

4.3.2 Patient-reported Outcomes 
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) is an umbrella term referring to  all outcomes and symptoms 
that are directly reported by a subject. Patient-reported outco mes, including HRQoL, have 
become significant endpoints when evaluating effectiveness of t reatments in clinical trials. 
Five separate pain NRS and the Short Form 36 Health Survey vers ion 2 (SF-36v2) have been 
selected for this study and will be administered at time points  indicated in Table 6 and 
Table 8. 
4.3.2.1  Pain NRS 
Eleven-point pain NRS will be used to capture a subject’s worst  pain levels experienced in the 
eyes, upper back, lower back, arms, and legs, where 0 = no pain  and 10 = worst pain 
imaginable. The subject will be asked to rate the pain he/she h as experienced in each of the 5 
locations over the past 24 hours. 
The pain NRS will be completed according to the schedule of pro cedures in Table 5, Table 6, 
Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 87 of 214 4.3.2.2  Short Form-36 Health Survey 
The SF-36v2 is a validated, generic health survey that captures  information about functional 
health and well-being from the patient’s perspective. The SF-36 v2 is for adults aged 18 years 
and older and it can be used across all diseases. The SF-36v2 c onsists of 36 items and 
measures eight domains (see Appendix 6). These are Physical Fun ctioning, Role Physical, 
Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role  Emotional, and Mental 
Health. The standard recall period of the SF-36v2 is 4 weeks wi th response options for each of 
the 36 items ranging from 1-3 (10 items), or 1-5 (26 items). Th e SF-36v2 is a self-completed 
paper-based survey, available in multiple modes of administrati on and can be completed in 
5 to 10 minutes. Translations are available for multiple countr ies and languages.  
As well as a profile of the eight domain scores, the SF-36v2 pr ovides psychometrically-based 
PCS and MCS scores. The scores range from 0-100, with a higher score indicting better health 
and well-being. The scores are calibrated so that 50 is the ave rage score or norm with a 
standard deviation of 10. 
The SF-36v2 with a 4-week recall period will be used at 3-month ly intervals throughout the 
study to evaluate HRQoL for the duration of the subject’s parti cipation in the study. 
If a subject has an Assessment Visit, the subject will be asked  to complete the SF-36 acute 
version (1-week recall) to capture the impact of the attack on HRQoL. These data will be used 
primarily for health economic purposes with the generation of a n attack utility profile.  
4.3.2.3  Collection of PRO Endpoints 
Standard procedures for minimizing bias and enhancing PRO compl iance will be followed 
throughout the study. Site assessments of PROs should be made p rior to any other site 
activities and encounters with physician, with exception of an Assessment Visit wherein 
procedures to identify an NMO/NMOSD attack will take precedence . The subjects will be 
instructed to complete the PROs independently. The site will ha ve a designated quiet space for 
subjects to use when completing the assessments. Dedicated inve stigational staff at the site 
will be responsible for ensuring that the PRO administration wi ll be followed according to the 
specific instructions from the clinical study team. The site st aff will be required to monitor 
that the subjects have completed the appropriate PRO instrument s in their entirety during the 
site visits.  
4.3.3 Medical History and Physical Examination, Electrocardiogram, 
Weight, Vital Signs, and Chest X-ray 
4.3.3.1  Medical History 
A complete medical history will be completed during screening. The subject’s full 
NMO/NMOSD disease history will also be captured, including date  of original diagnosis of 
NMO/NMOSD, historical AQP4-IgG status, relapse dates and type o f relapse (eg, ON,

autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto’s thyr oiditis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, diabetes, myasthenia gravis,  and pernicious anemia) will 
also be captured.  
On Day 1 of the RCP, the medical and disease history will be re viewed and any changes since 
screening will be documented, if applicable.  
4.3.3.2  Physical and Neurological Examination 
Complete physical and neurological examinations will be perform ed at intervals designated in 
the schedules of study procedures (see Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9) and 
include the following examinations: head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, lungs heart, abdomen, 
joints, muscles and soft tissues, nervous system, skin, lymph n odes, mental status, cranial 
nerves, nystagmus, motor system - muscle strength,  sensory sys tem - sensation, bowel and 
bladder function, deep tendon reflexes, gait, station, coordina tion, and other. Additional 
neurological exams may be conducted according to local practice . 
In the event that a new abnormality is identified, the investig ator should perform further 
investigations according to clinical judgment.  
Any abnormalities should be reported as AEs or signs/symptoms o f NMO as applicable. 
4.3.3.3  Body Weight and Height 
Height will be measured at screening. Body weight will be measu red at screening and at Days 
1, 85, and 197 of the RCP. 
Any abnormalities should be reported as AEs or signs/symptoms o f NMO/NMOSD as 
applicable. 
4.3.3.4  Electrocardiogram 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be evaluated at screeni ng, Day 1, Day 197, and at 
the Assessment Visit as presented in Table 5, Table 6, and Tabl e 8. These will be performed 
as per local investigative site procedures. The principal inves tigator or qualified designee will 
review and indicate if the ECG is normal, abnormal (clinically significant), or abnormal (not 
clinically significant). Any medically significant changes from  the screening ECG will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE. The QTc interval measurements will be  recorded for all subjects.  
Any abnormalities should be reported as AEs or signs/symptoms o f NMO as applicable.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 89 of 214 4.3.3.5  Vital Signs 
Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure [BP], pulse rate,  and respiratory rate) will 
be evaluated at screening, and at various time points as outlin ed in Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, 
Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10.  
Vital signs should be within 60 minutes prior to investigationa l product administration, every 
15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during the infusion, immediately (+ 5 minutes) after the end of the 
infusion, and then every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) for 2 hours a fter dosing or until stable, 
whichever is later.  
Any abnormalities should be reported as AEs or signs/symptoms o f NMO/NMOSD as 
applicable. 
It is important that body temperature is assessed in order to e valuate the subjects of any signs 
of infection or infusion reaction, especially when assessing fo r potential attacks.  
4.3.3.6  Chest X-ray 
A screening chest x-ray (anterior/posterior and lateral) will b e mandatory if, in the opinion of 
the investigator, the subject has a previous history of or a su spected pulmonary infection or 
disease. The chest x-ray will be performed during the screening  period. The chest x-ray may 
be substituted with documentation of a previous chest x-ray per formed within the previous 
3 months that meets the inclusion criteria. A previous computer ized tomography evaluation of 
the lungs may be substituted for the chest x-ray if performed w ithin the last 3 months. 
4.3.4 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
In 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration/Center for Drug Evaluation 
(US FDA/CDER) mandated that prospective suicidal ideation and b ehavioral assessments be 
conducted in clinical trials using investigational products tha t may be used for or appear to 
have an effect on the CNS.  
The Center for Suicide Risk Assessment and Columbia University Department of Psychiatry 
developed the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) t o assess suicide risk. The 
C-SSRS is unique in that it assesses both suicidal behavior and  predicts future attempts. The 
C-SSRS is used extensively across primary care, clinical practi ce, surveillance, research, and 
institutional settings.  
The C-SSRS involves a series of probing questions that inquire about possible suicidal 
thinking and behavior, and classifies these events of interest into 11 categories of interest as 
part of the assessment process. The terminology considered impo rtant includes 5 levels of 
suicidal ideation, 5 levels of suicidal behavior, and the categ ory “self-injurious behavior, no 
suicidal intent.” A different version of the C-SSRS is administ ered at different visits during 
the study. The Sponsor will be responsible for ensuring the rel evant site staff are appropriately 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 90 of 214 trained in the C-SSRS. Documented evidence of training of the s ites will be required prior to 
C-SSRS administration to subjects in the study.  
The “Baseline/Screening” questionnaire will be administered at screening (Appendix 7). This 
version of the scale combines the “Baseline” and “Screening” ve rsions to assess suicidality in 
a patient’s lifetime and over the 6 months prior to screening. This version can assess a 
subject’s lifetime suicidality for data collection purposes. Al though the C-SSRS is a detailed 
interview, the full questionnaire is needed only if the initial  screening questions regarding 
suicidal ideation and behavior are positive. Typically, the ass essment takes approximately 1 to 
2 minutes for those who have no positive findings and no more t han 10 minutes for subjects 
who may have a number of positive findings requiring further pr obing questions.  
The “Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS will be administer ed at all scheduled visits and 
Assessment Visits during the RCP, all visits during the OLP, an d every visit during the SFP 
for all subjects randomized into the study. The “Since Last Vis it” version assesses suicidality 
since the subject’s last visit. This version is used to assess subjects who have completed at 
least one initial C-SSRS assessment and should be used during t he RCP and the OLP. The 
“Since Last Visit” version assesses any suicidal thoughts or be haviors that the subject may 
have had since the last time they were administered the C-SSRS (Appendix 8). 
In the event that a subject is considered to be at risk based o n the outcome of the C-SSRS, the 
investigator should treat the subject according to their clinic al judgment and report the AE 
according to AE/SAE definitions and reporting requirements outl ined in this protocol (see 
Section 5.1, Section 5.2, and Section 5.4.  
4.3.5 Modified Rankin Scale 
The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for me asuring the degree of 
disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other 
causes of neurological disability ( Farrell et al, 1991 ; van Swieten et al, 1988 ).  
The mRS ranges from 0 to 6, ranging from perfect health without  symptoms to death as 
follows:  
x 0 - No symptoms 
x 1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual acti vities, despite some symptoms 
x 2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without a ssistance, but unable to carry 
out all previous activities 
x 3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk u nassisted 
x 4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodil y needs without assistance, 
and unable to walk unassisted 
x 5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and atten tion, bedridden, incontinent

employed that were statistically determined from drug naive val idation. Evaluations will be 
performed at baseline prior to administration of investigationa l product and at routine time 
points during the treatment and follow-up phase of the study or  at discontinuation.  
4.3.9 Biomarker Evaluations and Methods 
Samples for measurement of biomarkers listed below will be coll ected according to the 
schedules of procedures in Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8. Detai led procedures for sample 
collection, processing, storage, and shipment are presented in the Laboratory Manual provided 
to the study site 
Serum for AQP4-IgG Serostatus Assay 
The AQP4-IgG serostatus assay will be used to determine AQP4-Ig G serostatus for 
stratification purposes. The assay will be conducted by a centr al laboratory using a 
commercially available visual fluorescence-observation cell bin ding assay (EUROIMMUN) 
that has been validated to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amen dment/College of American 
Pathologists standards. The method involves detection of IgG bi nding to cells expressing 
recombinant AQP4. The serostatus of each subject will be provid ed to the site prior to 
randomization.  
The screening, baseline, and study visit assays used to determi ne AQP4-IgG titer will be 
conducted by a central laboratory using a quantitative flow cyt ometry assay based on binding 
of IgG to cells transfected with AQP4. Serum will be collected for the measurement of serum

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 94 of 214 AQP4-IgG by flow cytometry at visits specified in Table 5, Tabl e 6, Table 7, Table 8, and 
Table 9.  
Because MEDI-551 is hypothesized to reduce AQP4-IgG titers the AQP4-IgG titer levels 
reported for this study by the central laboratory will not be m ade available to the sites or the 
sponsor at any point during the study prior to unmasking of the  study. 
Whole Blood for Flow Cytometry 
Whole blood samples for quantification of relevant immune cells  will be collected 
according to the schedules of procedures in Table 5, Table 6, T able 7, Table 8, Table 9, and 
Table 10. Flow cytometry performed at a central laboratory will  be used to enumerate B-cell, 
T-cell, and natural killer (NK)-cell levels and to conduct immu nophenotyping analyses of 
various B-cell subsets. 
MEDI-551 is known to deplete CD19+ B cells. Therefore, in this study, the results of flow 
cytometry for B-cell counts could potentially be unmasking. For  this reason, these data will 
not be made available to the sites or the sponsor from post-ran domization through the 
remainder of the study prior to unmasking of the study. 
Whole Blood for Gene Expression  
Whole blood samples will be used to isolate messenger ribonucle ic acid (mRNA) and assess 
the effect of MEDI-551 on a specific plasma cell gene signature . In addition, the effects of 
MEDI-551 on the expression of mRNA in pathways thought to be in volved in NMO or related 
to treatment response will be explored. These analyses will be performed using Affymetrix 
whole genome expression array and/or TaqMan®-based assays on selected gene panels. Whole 
Blood will be collected at visits specified in Table 6, Table 7 , Table 8, and Table 10. Specific 
procedures for sample collection, processing, storage, and ship ment can be found in a separate 
laboratory manual provided to the sites. MEDI-551 is known to r educe the plasma cell gene 
signature. Because the results of the the plasma cell gene sign ature could potentially be 
unmasking, these samples will not be tested prior to unmasking of the study. 
4.3.9.1  Exploratory Investigations 
Serum for Exploratory Biomarker Studies 
Serum will be collected for the measurement of exploratory biom arkers at visits specified in 
Table 6, Table 7 and Table 8. The effect of MEDI-551 on relevan t protein biomarkers will be 
explored. These studies may include immunoglobulins, specific a utoantibodies or 
autoantibody arrays, inflammatory proteins (eg, cytokines and c hemokines), or other 
biomarkers and cell-based bioassays that are related to disease  mechanisms or the mechanism 
of action of MEDI-551. The presence of autoantibodies to antige ns other than AQP4 may be 
explored throughout the study.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 95 of 214 Whole Blood for DNA Analysis (Optional) 
To investigate genetic characteristics that may be associated w ith subjects’ clinical responses 
to MEDI-551, the following may be evaluated: polymorphisms in B -cell related genes, 
NK cell-related genes, Fc receptor genes, and changes in antibo dy or T-cell receptor gene 
sequences.  
The collection of blood for DNA analysis is optional. The compl etion of a separate ICF 
(Informed Consent Form for Collection of Blood Samples for DNA Analysis) must be signed 
by the subject if blood is to be used for DNA analysis (see Sec tion 4.1.4). Subjects who do not 
wish to have the DNA test will still be eligible for the study.  Subjects who elect to have the 
DNA analysis done may, at any time prior to the end of the stud y, request that the blood 
collected for DNA analysis be destroyed. However, this will onl y be possible prior to samples 
being de-identified as described below (also see Section 4.1.8) .  
All specimen and subject identifiers must be removed from the D NA blood samples such that 
under no circumstances can the DNA blood samples be linked back  to a specific subject. In 
most cases, this will require that DNA blood samples have curre nt labeling removed and the 
tubes relabeled. Special labeling capable of adhering to frozen  tubes must be used. If it is not 
possible to remove the original labeling, then it must be deter mined whether the DNA blood 
samples can go through a freeze thaw and be realiquoted in orde r to maintain confidentiality. 
All re-labeled DNA blood samples must be cross referenced to th e original demographics in a 
secure database to ensure that only designated and approved lab oratory personnel have access 
to these data. A special release must be obtained prior to use of specified DNA blood samples. 
4.3.10  Estimate of Volume of Blood to Be Collected 
The estimated volume of blood to be collected from each subject  at each visit (and across all 
visits) from screening through the SFP is presented in Table 14 . If repeats of any blood tests 
are required, the volume of blood collection will increase acco rdingly.

4.4 Study Suspension or Termination 
The Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or termin ate enrollment, RCP, OLP or 
the entire study at any time for the following reasons:  
1 The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indic ates a potential health 
hazard to subjects 
2 Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory 
3 Non-compliance that might significantly jeopardize the validity  or integrity of the trial  
4 Sponsor decision to terminate development

6 Recommendation of the independent DMC to discontinue enrollment  and transition 
subjects from the RCP to the OLP due to evidence of efficacy an d safety  
7 Any other reason which justify this action/actions. 
 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 97 of 214 If MedImmune determines that temporary suspension or terminatio n of the study is required, 
MedImmune will discuss the reasons for taking such action with all participating investigators 
(or head of the medical institution, where applicable). When fe asible, MedImmune will 
provide advance notice to all participating investigators (or h ead of the medical institution, 
where applicable) of the impending action. In the case of the S ponsor discontinuting 
enrollment upon recommendation of the independent DMC based on evidence of efficacy and 
safety, subjects in the RCP at the time enrollment is terminate d will be given the option to 
enter the OLP. The rationale for such a decision will be shared  and discussed with 
investigators, IRBs, ethic committees, and regulatory agencies where appropriate. In addition, 
detailed procedures for transition of patients from the RCP to the OLP will be provided to the 
investigators in such a case.  
If the study or any part of it is suspended or terminated for s afety or efficacy reasons, 
MedImmune will promptly inform all investigators, heads of the medical institutions (where 
applicable), and/or institutions conducting the study. MedImmun e will also promptly inform 
the relevant regulatory authorities of the suspension/terminati on along with the reasons for 
such action. Where required by applicable regulations, the inve stigator or head of the medical 
institution must inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the re ason(s) for the 
suspension/termination. If the study is suspended for safety re asons and it is deemed 
appropriate by the Sponsor to resume the study, approval from t he relevant regulatory 
authorities (and IRBs/IECs when applicable) will be obtained pr ior to resuming the study. 
4.5 Investigational Products 
4.5.1 Identity of Investigational Product(s) 
MedImmune will provide the investigator(s) with investigational  product (Table 15) using 
designated distribution centers.  
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 99 of 214 new dose must be prepared using a new vial. The dose preparatio n must be documented in the 
investigational product accountability log. The same line may b e used to administer 
investigational product (MEDI-551 or placebo) as used to admini ster premedication.  
Investigational Product Inspection 
Each vial selected for dose preparation should be inspected. ME DI-551 is supplied as a clear 
to opalescent, colorless to yellow liquid; free from or practic ally free from visible particles. 
The placebo is supplied as a clear to opalescent, colorless to yellow liquid; free from or 
practically free from visible particles. MEDI-551 is supplied a t a concentration of 10 mg/mL 
for IV infusion after dilution into a 0.9% (weight per volume [ w/v]) NaCl IV infusion bag.  
If there are any defects noted with the investigational product , the Investigator and Site 
Monitor should be notified immediately. Refer to the Product Co mplaint section for further 
instructions. 
Dose Preparation Steps 
Preparation of MEDI-551 or placebo into the IV infusion bag is to be performed aseptically. 
The investigational product manager should remove the tab porti on of the vial cap and clean 
the rubber stopper with 70% ethyl alcohol or equivalent. To avo id foaming, the vial should not 
be shaken. A vial should only be used one time to prepare a sin gle dose. 
MEDI-551 and placebo vials do not contain preservatives and any  unused portion must be 
discarded. 
MEDI-551 and placebo have been shown to be compatible when dilu ted into a polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC)-free, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)-free, and  latex-free infusion bag 
containing a total volume of 250 mL of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl for inje ction. A single 250 mL 
infusion bag will be prepared for each subject on each dosing d ay. To prepare each dose, a 
30 mL volume of NaCl must first be removed aseptically from the  infusion bag and discarded 
before either MEDI-551 or placebo is added to the bag. Next, a total of 30 mL of 
investigational product must be withdrawn aseptically from the 3 supplied investigational 
product vials in the kit (10 mL per vial) using a syringe and n eedle and added into the infusion 
bag using aseptic technique. After the investigational product is added to the infusion bag, the 
contents of the bag should be gently mixed to ensure homogeneit y of the solution within the 
bag. Do not shake or vigorously agitate the infusion bag.  
MEDI-551 and placebo will be identical in appearance and will b e clear to opalescent, 
colorless to yellow liquid, and free from or practically free f rom particles. The placebo is 
supplied as a clear to opalescent, colorless to yellow liquid, free from or practically free from 
particles. MEDI-551 and placebo doses will not be distinguishab le during dose preparation, 
handling, and infusion.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 100 of 214 Total in-use storage time from needle puncture of the MEDI-551 or placebo vials to start of 
administration should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or  24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F 
to 46°F). If storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must  be prepared from new vials.  
4.5.1.2  Treatment Administration 
Randomized-controlled Period 
The first day of dosing is considered Day 1. 
During the RCP, doses of investigational product must be admini stered according to the study 
schedule (Day 1 and Day 15). In the event that a subject or inv estigative site is unable to 
adhere to this schedule, a window of r 3 days is permitted at Day 15. In the event that the 
second dose of investigational product (scheduled to be given o n Day 15 post randomization) 
is delayed due to a medical/safety reason, dosing must be discu ssed with the medical monitor 
prior to administration of investigational product.  
If the subject is not dosed within this window they may remain in the RCP. 
Open-label Period 
For subjects completing Day 197 of the RCP, Day 1 of the OLP sh ould be the same day; 
however, it may be delayed for up to 14 days (procedures do not  need to be repeated). 
Subjects are not permitted to enter the OLP after 14 days, unle ss there is a compelling reason 
discussed with, and agreed to by, the medical monitor, in which  case a short extension may be 
granted. 
Subjects in the RCP at the time the 67th AC-determined attack occurs or when enrollment is 
discontinued upon recommendation of the independent DMC based o n evidence of efficacy 
and safety who wish to enroll in the OLP need to do so as soon as possible, preferably within 
14 days. Consulation with the medical monitor is advised in cas es where the transition to the 
OLP is not completed within 14 days.  
The first day of dosing of the OLP is considered OLP Day 1. 
During the OLP, the same schedule as the RCP applies for OLP Da y 1 and Day 15. In the 
event that the second dose of investigational product (schedule d to be given on Day 15 of the 
OLP) is delayed due to a medical/safety reason, dosing must be discussed with the medical 
monitor prior to administration of investigational product. For  the 6 monthly dosing visits, a 
dosing window of r 7 days will be permitted. If the subject has not returned with in the 7-day 
window in the OLP, the investigator must contact the subject an d discuss subsequent subject 
management with the medical monitor. Subjects may be withdrawn from study medication 
and enter the SFP at the discretion of the medical monitor.

IV infusion using the following guidelines: 
1 Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine preg nancy test prior to 
receiving MEDI-551 or placebo  
2 Subjects with signs or symptoms of clinically significant infec tions at the time of 
planned infusion of MEDI-551 or placebo should not be retreated  until the infection has 
resolved.  
3 MEDI-551 or placebo must be administered at room temperature by  controlled infusion 
via an infusion pump into a peripheral vein at a rate of 42 mL/ hr for the first 30 minutes, 
with the rate escalated in accordance with Table 16, unless an infusion reaction occurs 
necessitating the modulation or stopping of the infusion.  
4 MEDI-551 or placebo must not be administered via IV push or bol us but as a slow IV 
infusion. The entire content of the IV bag will be infused usin g an infusion pump using a 
0.22 or 0.2 micron filter.

resuscitation facilities should be available. 
6 At Day 1 and Day 15 of the RCP and OLP Day 1 and OLP Day 15 and  at subsequent 
dosing visits in the OLP, all study subjects will be premedicat ed with IV 
methylprednisolone (80-125 mg or equivalent glucocorticoid), PO  acetaminophen 
(500-650 mg) or equivalent dose of paracetamol, and PO diphenhy dramine (25-50 mg) 
or equivalent antihistamine, 30 to 60 minutes prior to MEDI-551  or placebo 
administration to mitigate infusion reactions.  
7 Prior to the start of the infusion, please be sure that the bag  content is at room 
temperature to avoid an infusion reaction due to the administra tion of the solution at low 
temperatures. 
8 Because of the possible need to vary infusion rates depending o n tolerance of the 
infusion, the total infusion time may exceed the time stated in  Table 16. UNLESS AN 
INFUSION REACTION OCCURS RESULTING IN DISCONTINUATION, THE 
ENTIRE INFUSION BAG CONTENTS MUST BE ADMINISTERED. 
9 If there are no requirements to slow, interrupt or permanently stop the infusion, the 
anticipated infusion time to deliver each dose is anticipated t o be 
90 minutes ± 15 minutes. 
10 After IV administration, up to an additional 25 mL of saline wi ll be given via infusion 
pump at the same pump speed utilized at the completion of the i nitial dosing. 
 
The duration of investigational product infusion and duration o f investigational product 
administration will be calculated as follows: 
Duration of Infusion Time:  The amount of time elapsed from the infusion start time to the  
infusion stop time. Infusion start time is defined as the time point wherein investigational 
product is first infused into the subject. Infusion stop time i s defined as the time point where 
the infusion pump completes infusion of the investigational pro duct, not including the slow 
clearing of the infusion line. Beware not to rapidly clear the infusion line containing the 
residual investigational product as it may trigger an infusion reaction. 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 103 of 214 Duration of Administration:  The amount of time elapsed from the infusion pump start time 
to the infusion pump stop time PLUS the time required to clear the infusion line of residual 
investigational product. The duration of administration will al ways be greater than the 
duration of infusion and will always include the slow clearing of the infusion line. 
Both the duration of the investigational product infusion and t he duration of investigational 
product administration will be recorded. 
Pharmacokinetic laboratory samples will be collected on Day 1 a nd Day 15 predose and 
approximately 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) after the completion of MEDI-551 or placebo 
administration.  
If a subject experiences an AE in the OLP that the investigator  assesses as related to 
investigational product, the subsequent dose may be delayed up to 14 days from the date of 
the next scheduled dose.  
4.5.1.3  Monitoring of Dose Administration  
Vital signs (body temperature, BP, pulse rate, and respiratory rate) must be taken with the 
subject in a semi-supine position as follows:  
x Within 60 minutes prior to investigational product administrati on 
x Every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during the infusion 
x Immediately (± 5 minutes) after the end of the infusion 
x Every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) for 2 hours after dosing or unti l stable, whichever is later  
 
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during the infusion, vita l signs will be taken more 
frequently, as warranted by the severity of the reaction.  
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration  are possible. Therefore, 
appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphyla ctic reactions must be 
immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to r ecognize and treat 
anaphylaxis.  
For Japanese subjects only, the initial dose on Day 1 of the RC P should be administered as a 
patient in-hospital procedure. The subject can be discharged th e next day (Day 2) if no 
abnormal findings are observed. 
4.5.1.4  Reporting Product Complaints 
Any defects with the investigational product must be reported immediately  to the MedImmune

compliance. The Sponsor will provide reimbursement during the s tudy. 
4.5.2.2  Rescue Medications 
Assessment of new symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms sh ould be completed within 
5 days to determine if an attack has occurred. Treatment of an attack should preferably be 
initiated after completion of the attack assessment and the det ermination that the protocol 
attack criteria have been met. However, the Principal Investiga tor can initiate rescue therapy 
at any time before full assessment is completed. Rescue therapy  will be given as directed by 
the investigator and may include IV corticosteroids, IVIG, and/ or PLEX. PPD

document and include the dose, start and stop dates, frequency,  and route of administration 
and reason for product administration. 
4.5.3 Dose Adjustments and Missed Doses 
Dose adjustments are not permitted in this study. If, in the cl inical judgment of the 
investigator, a subject is not well enough to receive investiga tional product, the dose should be 
omitted. In the event that a dose of investigational product is  delayed due to medical/safety 
reasons, dosing and subject management must be discussed with t he medical monitor prior to 
administration of further investigational product.   
A dosing window of r 7 days will be permitted at the 6 monthly visits. 
4.5.4 Labeling  
Labels will be prepared in accordance with Good Manufacturing P ractice (GMP) and local 
regulatory guidelines. The label will fulfill GMP Annex 13 requ irements for labeling. Label 
text will be translated into local languages, as required. 
4.5.5 Storage  
MEDI-551 or placebo is to be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F ).  
4.5.6 Treatment Compliance 
Investigational product will be administered by study site pers onnel, who will monitor 
compliance. 
4.5.7 Accountability 
The investigator’s or site’s designated investigational product  manager is required to maintain 
accurate investigational product accountability records. The Me dImmune representative who 
visits the study site to monitor the data will regularly review  these records to ensure 
completion and compliance. Upon completion of the study, copies  of investigational product 
accountability records will be returned to MedImmune. All unuse d investigational product 
will be returned to a MedImmune-authorized depot or disposed of  upon authorization by 
MedImmune.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 106 of 214 4.6 Treatment Assignment and Masking 
4.6.1 Methods for Assigning Treatment Groups 
An IVRS/IWRS will be used for randomization to a treatment grou p and assignment of 
masked investigational product kit numbers. A subject is consid ered randomized into the 
study when the investigator notifies the IVRS/IWRS that the sub ject meets eligibility criteria 
and the IVRS/IWRS provides the assignment of masked investigati onal product kit numbers 
to the subject. 
Subjects will be randomized at a 3:1 ratio with a permuted bloc k randomization scheme to 
receive either MEDI-551 or placebo within each AQP4-IgG stratum  determined at screening 
(seropositive versus seronegative). Enrollment will be further stratified by Japan versus non-
Japan region.  
4.6.2 Methods for Ensuring Masking 
This is a double-masked study in which MEDI-551 and placebo are  identically labeled and 
indistinguishable in appearance. As such, neither the subject/l egal representative nor any of 
the investigator or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treat ment or clinical evaluation of the 
subjects will be aware of the treatment received (ICH E9) (see Section 4.6.4.2 for unmasking 
related to interim analysis). In the event that treatment alloc ation for a subject becomes known 
to the investigator or other study staff involved in the manage ment of study subjects, the 
Sponsor must be notified immediately . If the treatment allocation for a subject needs to be 
known to treat an individual subject for an AE, the investigato r must notify the Sponsor 
immediately  and, if possible, before unmasking the treatment allocation.  
Administration of the masked dose of MEDI-551 or placebo on OLP  Day 15 is necessary to 
correctly administer the loading dose of 600 mg IV MEDI-551 to subjects previously 
randomized to the placebo group during the RCP, or to ensure th at subjects previously 
randomized to MEDI-551 do not receive an extra treatment dose. This masking mechanism 
will be implemented through the IVRS to ensure that treatment d uring the RCP is not revealed 
to the sites.  
4.6.3 Methods for Reducing Bias 
The following steps are being planned to mitigate/reduce bias t owards the assessment of an 
NMO/NMOSD attack: 
1 Study subjects will be instructed not to discuss AEs or NMO/NMO SD-related 
symptoms/medications with any of the independent assessors. 
2 The EDSS rater will not have access to prior EDSS scores/FSS at  the time of a new 
evaluation and will perform the evaluation of the subject witho ut any knowledge of the 
subject’s AE history or management of symptoms or findings from  physical/neurological 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 107 of 214 examinations. The EDSS rater will be instructed NOT to elicit o r discuss the subjects’ 
experiences or AEs on the study. The EDSS rater must not manage  the subject outside of 
the protocol for routine care or any other purpose. The EDSS sc ores will be captured 
electronically and transmitted to the investigator who will hav e access to the scores to 
compare against the protocol-defined criteria for an NMO/NMOSD attack. The EDSS 
scores/FSS will be monitored centrally by an independent expert . 
3 The ophthalmology examiner will not have access to prior visual  acuity and RAPD at the 
time of a new evaluation and perform the evaluation of the subj ect without any 
knowledge of the subject’s AE history or management of symptoms  or findings from 
physical/neurological examination. The ophthalmology examiner w ill be instructed NOT 
to elicit or discuss the subjects’ experiences or AEs on the st udy. The ophthalmology 
examiner must not manage the subject outside of the protocol fo r routine care or any 
other purpose. The visual acuity scores and RAPD findings will be captured 
electronically and transmitted to the investigator who will hav e access to the score to 
compare against the protocol-defined criteria for an NMO/NMOSD attack. 
4 The neuro-radiologist will not have access to the subject’s AE history or management of 
symptoms or findings from physical/neurological examination. 
5 To minimize the potential influence of MRI findings on clinical  assessment of possible 
attacks, MRI images/study report should not be reviewed by the Principal Investigator 
unless a specific criterion for an attack requires review of th e MRI. In such cases, review 
of the MRI image and local study report MUST be done AFTER all relevant clinical 
assessments are completed. The time sequence of all procedures and reviews required for 
assessment will be documented to demonstrate compliance. 
6 To further minimize the potential influence of MRI findings on the adjudication of 
possible attacks, the AC will not be given access to the MRIs ( where required) until after 
their evaluation of the clinical data is complete.  
7 To minimize the potential influence of the Principal Investigat or’s review on the AC, the 
AC will not be provided with the Principal Investigator’s opini on as to whether an attack 
has occurred or not, nor will the AC receive information about which protocol attack 
criterion was met and the rescue medication utilized. 
8 To assess for a potential bias in the investigator’s assessment  of new symptoms, the data 
generated from this assessment, which determined that the sympt oms were not related to 
NMO/NMOSD, will be sent to review by the AC. The level of agree ment between the 
investigator and the AC will be assessed. 
 
4.6.4 Methods for Unmasking  
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emerg encies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the treatment r andomization. The 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 108 of 214 investigator documents and reports the action to MedImmune, wit hout revealing the treatment 
given to subject to the MedImmune staff. 
MedImmune retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are  unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  
4.6.4.1  Unmasking in the Event of a Medical Emergency 
In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator must firs t attempt to contact the medical 
monitor to discuss the medical emergency and the reason for wan ting to unmask the subject’s 
investigational product allocation prior to proceeding with unm asking. (Czech Republic only: 
in the event of a medical emergency that may be related to inve stigational product, the 
investigator may unmask an individual subject’s investigational  product allocation if he/she 
feels it is required without prior contact to the medical monit or/sponsor.) Unmasking should 
occur only if the subject’s medical emergency would be managed differently as a result of the 
subject’s having received investigational product. In most case s, management of the medical 
emergency would be the same whether or not the subject received  investigational product. If 
this is the case, the investigational product allocation should  not be unmasked. 
In exceptional circumstances, where in the clinical judgment of  the investigator the medical 
emergency necessitates that the subject’s investigational produ ct allocation be immediately 
unmasked, the investigator may proceed with unmasking without p rior discussion with the 
medical monitor. 
Instructions for unmasking an individual subject’s investigatio nal product allocation are 
contained in the IVRS/IWRS manual.  
4.6.4.2  Unmasking for Interim Analysis Purposes 
An unmasked interim analysis is planned for this study as descr ibed in Section 4.8.10. The 
interim analysis to determine futility will be conducted by the  DMC; Sponsor, and sites will 
remain masked to the treatment assignment post-interim analysis .  
4.6.4.3  Unmasking due to Known or Hypothesized Effects of MEDI-551 
MEDI-551 is known to deplete CD19+ B-cells; therefore, the resu lts of flow cytometry to 
count B-cells are potentially unmasking. These data will not be  made available to 
investigation sites post randomization through the remainder of  the study. 
Data from early phase development in non-oncology subject popul ations receiving MEDI-551 
suggest that MEDI-551 administration may be associated with pot ential unspecified mild 
reduction in total Ig in individual subjects. Since this reduct ion may be potentially unmasking, 
these data will not be made available to investigational sites post randomization through the 
remainder of the study. 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 109 of 214 MEDI-551 is hypothesized to reduce titers of AQP4-IgG. AQP4-IgG  titers from the central 
laboratory will not be made available to investigational sites at any point in the study.  
MEDI-551 is known to reduce the plasma cell gene signature. Bec ause the results of the 
plasma cell gene signature assay could potentially be unmasking , these samples will not be 
tested prior to un-masking of the study. 
MEDI-551 may also reduce tetanus vaccine titers; therefore, the  results of the vaccine titer 
assay will not be mabe available to the sites at any point duri ng the study. 
Any potentially unmasking data from the protocol will not be av ailable to the sponsor until the 
study has been unmasked following completion of the RCP. 
Investigators must not request any potentially unmasking labora tory results at a local or other 
central laboratory. 
4.7 Restrictions During the Study and Concomitant Treatment(s) 
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any  medication taken from the 
time of screening until the end of the study (final study visit ). Any concomitant medication(s), 
including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be r ecorded.  
4.7.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications 
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatmen ts deemed necessary to 
provide adequate supportive care except for those medications i dentified as “excluded” as 
listed in Section 4.7.2. Specifically, subjects should receive full supportive care during the 
study, including transfusions of blood and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, anti-
emetics, anti-diarrheals, and analgesics, and other care as dee med appropriate, and in 
accordance with their ins titutional gui delines. 
Subjects who experience an NMO/NMOSD attack should be given res cue therapy according 
to the judgment of the investigator as described in Section 4.5 .2.2.  
All concomitant and rescue therapy given to the subject during the study will be recorded on 
the source document and includes, but is not limited to, the do se, start and stop dates, 
frequency, route of administration, and reason for administrati on.  
4.7.1.1  Immunosuppressive Medications During the Screening Period 
Subjects that have previously been taking immunosuppressive med ications (including but not 
limited to, AZA and MMF) and steroids not specifically excluded  in Section 4.1.3 for the 
prevention or treatment of NMO/NMOSD relapses may continue to t ake those medications 
during the screening period as long as the dose remains stable or decreases. 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 110 of 214 Immunosuppressive medications must be stopped prior to dosing o n Day 1. Steroids must 
continue according to the protocol (see Section 4.5.2.2). 
4.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
The following medications (and procedure) are prohibited from t he day of dosing on Day 1 
through the end of the subjects’ participation in the OLP:  
x Any immunosuppressant for the prevention of NMO/NMOSD attacks ( this includes but is 
not limited to AZA, MMF, rituximab, etc) 
x High-dose steroids, with the exception of those required to tre at an  NMO/NMOSD attack 
x Low-dose steroids, unless discussed and agreed with the medical  monitor, with the 
exception of those specified by the protocol in the RCP and top ical steroids 
x PLEX, unless used to treat an NMO/NMOSD attack.  
x Alemtuzumab 
x Eculizumab 
x Total lymphoid irradiation 
x Bone marrow transplant 
x T-cell vaccination therapy 
x Natalizumab 
x Cyclosporin 
x Methotrexate 
x Mitoxantrone  
x Cyclophosphamide 
x Tocilizumab 
x Any other immunosuppressant medication, unless discussed and ap proved by the medical 
monitor 
 
In addition to the medications described above, subjects must b e instructed not to take any 
medications, including over-the-counter products, without first  consulting with the 
investigator. 
Subjects may exit the OLP at any time for any reason, including  seeking alternative treatment 
options, at which point they will enter the SFP. 
There are no prohibited medications during the SFP. During the SFP, a subject may receive 
standard treatment for their NMO/NMOSD at the discretion of the  investigator and in 
compliance with established clinical practice.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 111 of 214 4.8 Statistical Evaluation 
4.8.1 General Considerations 
Tabular summaries will be presented by treatment group. Categor ical data will be summarized 
by the number and percentage of subjects in each category. Cont inuous variables will be 
summarized by descriptive statistics. Additional details of sta tistical analyses will be 
described in the statistical analysis plan.  
The primary and key secondary endpoints will be analyzed and re ported based on both AQP4-
IgG seropositive and Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population, defined as all subjects who are 
randomized into the study and receive at least one dose of inve stigational product. Additional 
efficacy analyses will be performed in both seropositive and IT T populations. Treatment 
groups will be analyzed according to the initial randomization,  regardless of whether subjects 
receive an investigational product different from that to which  they were randomized. 
The safety data will be presented using the as-treated populati on, which will include all 
subjects who receive any investigational product. Specifically,  subjects who received all 
placebo doses will be included in the placebo group for safety analyses; conversely, subjects 
who received at least one dose of MEDI-551 will be included in the active treatment group for 
safety analyses.  
Efficacy and safety data from the OLP will be presented based o n subjects who receive at 
least one dose during the OLP. 
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical inference will be d one at a significance level of 
two-sided α = 0.05.  
4.8.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations 
The current study is being planned to detect a target relative reduction of 60% in risk for time 
from Day 1 to onset of an AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack on or before Day 197 with 
90% power and α = 0.05 (two-sided). Details are provided in App endix 9. A total of 67 AC-
determined NMO/NMOSD attacks are required for the ITT populatio n. Subjects will be 
randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either MEDI-551 or placebo  within both AQP4-IgG 
seropositive and seronegative strata. The stratification ratio is anticipated to be approximately 
80:20 with higher allocation to the seropositive cohort. If the  seropositive cohort has 80% of 
the attacks, the study will have approximately 82% power to det ect the target relative 
reduction of 60%. 
A maximum of 252 subjects will be randomized and dosed in this study. Because this study is 
event-driven where the primary objective is based on a total of  67 AC-determined 
NMO/NMOSD attacks, and the rate of NMO/NMOSD attacks is not est ablished in the 
literature, this number of subjects was determined by analyzing  masked data of the actual 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 112 of 214 attack rate from the first 78 subjects who completed the RCP in  this study. The attack status 
(attack/no attack) of the 78 subjects was randomly sampled with  different attack rate which 
gave an estimate of the number of attacks for the total sample size. This simulation process 
was repeated 10,000 times to give a distribution of the number of attacks for the total sample 
size, from which the probability of observing at least 67 attac ks could be estimated. Based on 
the 78 completed subjects, this procedure showed that with 252 subjects there is a 90% 
probability of reaching the required 67 AC-determined attacks. 
Within each AQP4-IgG stratum, randomization will also be strati fied by region (Japan vs non-
Japan). The number of Japanese subjects will be determined prim arily by feasibility and will 
not depend on a minimum number of NMO/NMOSD attacks to be obser ved from Japanese 
subjects.  
4.8.3 Efficacy 
4.8.3.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The following are the null and alternative hypotheses associate d with the primary endpoint: 
ܪ଴ଵǣܴܪାൌͳ vs ܪଵଵǣܴܪା്ͳ, 
ܪ଴ଶǣܴܪ஺௅௅ൌͳ vs ܪଵଶǣܴܪ஺௅௅്ͳ, 
where ܴܪା indicates the hazard ratio of AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack f or MEDI-551 
relative to placebo in AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects. ܴܪ஺௅௅ denotes the same quantity for 
the ITT population. The treatment effect in the seropositive co hort will be defined as the 
relative reduction in ܴܪା; ie, 100 × (1- ܴܪା)A value of ܴܪା < 1 or a positive value of 
relative reduction will indicate the efficacy of MEDI-551 compa red to placebo in the 
seropositive cohort. Similar interpretations will hold for ܴܪ஺௅௅Ǥ For the current study, the 
target treatment effect of 60% implies a hazard ratio (HR) of 0 .4.  
For the AQP4-IgG seropositive cohort, the treatment effect will  be assessed using the 
Cox proportional hazards model with treatment indicator (MEDI-5 51 or placebo) as an 
explanatory factor; whereas for the ITT population, the model w ill also include serostatus as 
an additional explanatory factor. The HR of MEDI-551 versus pla cebo will be estimated 
together with its associated 95% confidence interval (CI). The SAS PROC PHREG will be 
used for fitting this model. Subjects who complete Day 197 of t he RCP or discontinue the 
study before Day 197 for reasons other than an AC-determined NM O/NMOSD attack will be 
censored in this model at the time of the Day 197/discontinuati on visit. See Section 4.8.9 for 
details regarding Type I error control. 
An indicator variable for Japan versus non-Japan region will no t be included in the Cox 
regression model due to the low number of anticipated Japanese subjects. An evaluation of 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 113 of 214 consistency of treatment effect in Japanese subjects with that observed in the global study will 
be determined. 
The data cutoff date for the primary analysis will be when the last subject completes the 
discontinuation visit following the 67th AC-determined attack, after all subjects complete the 
RCP if 67 AC-determined attacks do not occur, or after all subj ects complete the EDV 
following discontinuation of enrollment upon recommendation of the independent DMC 
based on evidence of efficacy and safety. Subjects who are in t he RCP when a total of 67 AC-
determined NMOSD attacks have occurred or when enrollment is di scontinued upon 
recommendation of the DMC based on evidence of efficacy and saf ety will discontinue the 
RCP as outlined in Section 4.5.1.2. 
Since some AC-determined attacks may not be assessed within the  assessment windows, a 
broader window will be used for primary analysis. Only AC-deter mined attacks with an 
assessment visit scheduled within 120 hours (5 days) of reporti ng symptoms and all 
assessments done within 10 days of an Assessment Visit will be included in the primary 
analysis. AC-determined attacks not included in primary analysi s will be included in other 
supportive analyses. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of the loss of 
any AC-determined attacks outside of the identified assessment window. 
4.8.3.2  Additional Analyses of the Primary Endpoint 
An estimate of the cumulative event rates through the end of th e RCP will be calculated using 
the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Graphical displays of KM estimate s and cumulative 
incidence estimates will be presented by treatment group. 
The following sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will  be performed:  
1 Analysis using the Cox regression model and the following basel ine characteristics and 
treatment as exploratory variables: 
x Number of NMO/NMOSD relapses prior to randomization 
x Baseline EDSS score 
2 Analysis similar to primary analysis but considering only unani mous AC-determined 
NMO/NMOSD attacks (all 3 adjudicators agree) as events, remaini ng subjects will be 
considered as censored. 
3 Analysis similar to primary analysis but also considering subje cts who prematurely 
discontinue the RCP without experiencing an AC-determined NMO/N MOSD attack as 
treatment failures (events); remaining subjects will be conside red as censored. 
4 Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of the loss of any 
AC-determined attacks outside of the identified assessment wind ow in the primary 
analysis.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114 of 214 4.8.3.3  Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary endpoints 1 through 4 presented in Section 2.2.2 for AQP4-IgG seropositive cohort 
will be analyzed as follows:  
x Treatment effect for secondary efficacy endpoints based on EDSS  worsening will be 
assessed using a logistic regression model with treatment and b aseline EDSS as 
explanatory variables. The percentage of subjects meeting the e ndpoints, odds ratios, 
p-value, and 95% CIs of the odds ratios will be presented.  
x The treatment effect for the low-contrast visual acuity measure d by change from baseline 
in low-contrast Landolt C Broken Rings Chart binocular scores w ill be assessed using an 
analysis of covariance model using treatment and baseline Lando lt C Broken Rings Chart 
binocular score as explanatory variables. 
x The treatment effect for the secondary efficacy endpoints based  on the cumulative 
number of active MRI lesions and number of NMO/NMOSD-related in -patient 
hospitalizations will be tested using Negative Binomial regress ion with treatment as an 
explanatory variable. 
 
Similar analyses will be performed for the ITT population by ex tending the above mentioned 
models to include an indicator variable for serostatus as well.  
See Section 4.8.9 for details regarding Type I error control. 
Annualized attack rate (total number of AC-determined NMO/NMOSD  attacks normalized by 
person-years) during any exposure to MEDI-551 will be summarize d descriptively. 
4.8.3.4  Subgroup Analyses 
Consistency of treatment effect measured by primary and key sec ondary efficacy endpoints in 
the following subgroups will be investigated as follows: 
x Sex (male vs female) 
x Baseline EDSS (< 5 vs ≥ 5) 
x Number of prior NMO/NMOSD relapses (< 2 vs ≥ 2) 
x Disease duration category (< 5 years vs ≥ 5 years) 
x AQP4-IgG serostatus (positive vs negative) as determined at scr eening 
 
The nominal p-value and 95% CIs of treatment effect will be pro vided for each subgroup 
analysis. 
4.8.4 Safety  
4.8.4.1  Analysis of Adverse Events 
The safety and tolerability of MEDI-551 will be assessed at com pletion of the study primarily 
by summarizing TEAEs including TESAEs. The occurrence of TEAEs will be collected and 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 115 of 214 summarized from the commencement of infusion of investigational  product through the end of 
study. Treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs will be summarized by sy stem organ class and 
preferred terms, by severity, and by relationship to the invest igational product. For the OLP, 
the rate of AEs normalized by patient-years may be provided.  
4.8.4.2  Analysis of Clinical Laboratory Parameters, Physical Examinatio n Findings, 
and Vital Sign Measurements 
Laboratory measurements as well as their changes from baseline at each collection time point 
and shift from baseline if applicable will be summarized descri ptively. Significant physical 
examination findings and vital sign measurements will also be s ummarized using descriptive 
analyses. 
4.8.5 Patient-reported Outcomes 
4.8.5.1  Short Form-36 Health Survey 
Treatment effect for the PRO endpoint based on SF-36 PCS (4-wee k recall) change from 
baseline at the last visit of the RCP will be tested using an a nalysis of covariance model using 
treatment and baseline SF-36 PCS score as explanatory variables . Similar analysis will be 
done for SF-36 MCS. 
For the 8 remaining domains, summaries of change from baseline will be presented. 
4.8.5.2  Pain NRS 
Treatment effect for pain in 5 locations (eyes, legs, arms, upp er back, and lower back) based 
on separate NRS change from baseline at the last visit of the R CP will be tested using analyses 
of covariance models using treatment and baseline pain NRS scor es as explanatory variables. 
4.8.6 Analysis of Immunogenicity, Pharmacokinetics, and Exploratory 
Biomarkers 
4.8.6.1  Analysis of Immunogenicity 
The presence of ADAs to MEDI-551 in serum will be assessed over  the duration of the study. 
Immunogenicity results will be analysed by summarizing the numb er and percentage of 
subjects who develop detectable ADA by treatment group. The ass ociation of ADA with 
MEDI-551 concentration, blood B-cell levels, attack rate, and T EAEs may be evaluated. 
4.8.6.2  Analysis of Pharmacokinetics 
MEDI-551 concentration will be summarized descriptively over vi sits separated by 
AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative NMO/NMOSD subjects. Indi vidual and mean 
MEDI-551 concentration versus time data will be plotted by AQP4 -IgG seropositive and 
seronegative subjects. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estim ated using noncompartmental 
methods. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be listed by subjects and separated by AQP4-IgG 
seropositive and seronegative NMO/NMOSD subjects and summarized  descriptively.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 116 of 214 Population PK or PK/PD analysis may be conducted to include the  exploratory analysis to 
identify the covariates that affect MEDI-551 PK in this subject  population, or to investigate 
the relationship between MEDI-551 PK, PD, and response as appro priate. 
4.8.6.3  Analysis of Exploratory Biomarkers 
AQP4-IgG titer, plasma gene signature change from baseline, and  B-cell absolute counts and 
relative percentage based on baseline will be summarized descri ptively by treatment groups. 
Additional research data and associated exploratory analyses ma y be reported separately from 
the main clinical study report.  
4.8.7 Additional Analyses 
An exploratory analysis of time to AC-determined NMO/NMOSD atta ck or rescue therapy 
without an AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack during the RCP will b e conducted by 
considering rescue therapy  as events of interest as well. Subjects who never experience an y 
AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack nor receive rescue therapy will be censored for this 
analysis. 
The agreement between site-determined NMO/NMOSD attack and AC- determined 
NMO/NMOSD attacks will be assessed by Kappa statistic.  
An inter- and intra-rater reliability assessment will be perfor med based on a random selection 
of all events contributing to the primary analysis. 
A shift analysis of the scores from the mRS will be performed.  
4.8.8 Data Monitoring Committee 
An unmasked independent DMC will perform evaluations of safety and clinical outcome data 
at specified regular intervals throughout the study and make re commendations to the sponsor 
regarding further conduct of the study. The DMC will conduct an  interim analysis for futility 
as described in the description of the interim analysis in Sect ion 4.8.10.  
The DMC will monitor drop-out and missing primary and secondary  outcome data on a case 
by case basis. In addition, the DMC will assess the thoroughnes s of the screening for possible 
NMO/NMOSD attacks and the effectiveness of the masking.  
The DMC will receive ‘real time’ reports of new NMO/NMOSD attac ks and will review the 
adherence of the investigators and AC to the process of attack diagnosis and adjudication.  
Additional details will be provided in a separate DMC charter.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 117 of 214 4.8.9 Control of Type I Error 
The study is designed to strongly control the overall Type I er ror rate of α = 0.05 based on the 
Bonferroni-based chain procedure ( Bretz et al, 2009 ; Millen and Dmitrienko, 2011 ). The 
primary null hypothesis will be hierarchically tested first at α = 0.05 in the AQP4-IgG 
seropositive cohort, and, if significant, it will be further te sted in the ITT population at 
α = 0.05. If and only if the treatment group comparison is stat istically significant within the 
ITT population, secondary hypotheses will be tested. Null hypot heses for the 4 key secondary 
endpoints will follow the same sequential testing strategy as t he primary analysis (testing 
within seropositive subjects first, followed by the ITT populat ion if the comparison within 
seropositive subjects is statistically significant). Each secon dary hypothesis will be initially 
tested based on the Bonferroni method at α = 0.05/4 = 0.0125. I f the null hypothesis for a 
particular secondary endpoint is rejected across both the serop ositive and the ITT populations, 
the Type I error saved will be propagated equally to other non- rejected sets of secondary null 
hypotheses. The testing procedure will be repeated until all nu ll hypotheses are rejected or no 
further null hypothesis can be rejected. Details are described in Appendix 11. 
4.8.10  Interim Analysis for Futility 
An unmasked interim analysis will be conducted for futility ass essment by an independent 
DMC when approximately 50% of the total planned AC-determined N MO/NMOSD attacks 
occur in this study. The information fraction will be determine d by the ratio of the number of 
observed cases of AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks and the plann ed number of 
AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks. The predictive power will be c alculated for the 
primary efficacy endpoint in the AQP4-IgG seropositive cohort a s well as the ITT population 
based on the empirical trend observed at the interim analysis ( Lan et al, 2009 ). The study may 
be declared as “futile” if calculated predictive power at inter im is < 20% in both AQP4-IgG 
seropositive cohort and the ITT population. Details are provide d in Appendix 10. 
5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
5.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
The ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) E6(R1) defin es an AE as: 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical invest igation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a ca usal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintende d sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally as sociated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the med icinal product. 
An AE includes but is not limited to any clinically significant  worsening of a subject’s pre-
existing condition. An abnormal laboratory finding (including E CG finding) that requires 
medical intervention by the investigator, or a finding judged b y the investigator as medically 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 118 of 214 significant should be reported as an AE. If clinical sequelae a re associated with a laboratory 
abnormality, the diagnosis or medical condition should be repor ted (eg, renal failure, 
hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatin ine, urine red blood cells 
increased). Abnormal laboratory values that are not, in the inv estigator’s opinion, medically 
significant and do not require intervention should not be repor ted as AEs.  
Adverse events may be treatment emergent (eg, occurring after i nitial receipt of 
investigational product) or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatme nt-emergent AE is any new 
sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written informed 
consent has been obtained but before the subject has received i nvestigational product.  
Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surger y (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonser ious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elective procedure or r outinely scheduled treatment 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE. 
For the purposes of this protocol, NMO/NMOSD attacks will not b e recorded as an AE during 
either the RCP or the OLP. Symptoms that are subsequently diagn osed due to another 
underlying cause will be recorded as AEs.  
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE that: 
x Results in death (for the purposes of this protocol, this inclu des NMO/NMOSD disease 
progression or attack) 
x Is immediately life-threatening

x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of the subjec t 
x Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject o r may require medical

Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, bloo d dyscrasias, or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalizations; infection that requires  treatment with IV antibiotics; or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 119 of 214 For the purposes of this protocol, NMO/NMOSD disease progressio n or attack that do not 
result in death, but meet any of the other above listed SAE cri teria, will not be reported as an 
SAE unless it occurs during the screening period or in the SFP.  
NMO/NMOSD disease progression or attacks that result in death w ill be reported as 
SAEs. 
All occurrences of NMO/NMOSD attacks will be carefully monitore d by the site staff and the 
Sponsor to ensure these are identified in the required reportin g timeline.  
Additionally, hospitalization for any procedure resulting from an NMO/NMOSD attack will 
not be reported as an SAE (eg, PLEX that could result in hospitali zation).  
5.3 Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientifi c and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the Investigational Product and requires close  monitoring and rapid 
communication by the investigator to the Sponsor. An AESI may b e serious or non-serious. 
The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing analysis of these e vents in order to characterize 
and understand them in association with the use of this investi gational product. 
Two adverse events are considered AESIs for this study: 1) hepa tic function abnormality 
meeting the definition of Hy’s law; and 2) PML. See Section 5.6 .2 and Section 5.6.3  for the 
definition and reporting of AESIs of hepatic function abnormali ty and PML, respectively.  
5.4 Recording of Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be recorded on the eCRF using a recognized medical term or diagnosis 
that accurately reflects the event. Adverse events will be asse ssed by the investigator for 
severity, relationship to the investigational product, possible  etiologies, and whether the event 
meets criteria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notif ication to the Sponsor’s 
Patient Safety designee as described in Section 5.5. See Sectio n 5.2 for the definition of SAEs 
and Appendix 3 and Appendix 12 for guidelines for assessment of  severity and relationship. If 
an AE evolves into a condition that meets the regulatory defini tion of “serious,” it will be 
reported on the SAE Report Form. 
Infusion of biological products is commonly associated with inf usion related reactions. 
Anaphylaxis and infusion related reactions have some common man ifestations and may be 
difficult to distinguish from each other. Infusion related reac tions are commonly observed 
during or shortly after the first time exposure to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies delivered 
through intravenous infusion. These reactions are less common f ollowing subsequent 
exposures. Unlike infusion related reactions, anaphylaxis is a rare event, usually occurring 
after subsequent exposure to an antigen, and it is most commonl y accompanied by severe

should be reported to the Sponsor/designee after outcome. 
Should the investigator become aware of a pregnancy in the part ner of a male study subject 
who has received investigational product, this should be report ed within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event  to Sponsor/designee as above.  The Sponsor will endeavor to co llect 
follow-up information on such pregnancies provided the partner of the study subject provides 
consent. 
6 STUDY AND DATA MANAGEMENT 
6.1 Training of Study Site Personnel 
Before the first subject is entered into the study, a MedImmune  representative will review and 
discuss the requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and rel ated documents with the 
investigational staff and also train them in any study-specific  procedures and system(s) 
utilized. This will include use of all assessment scales to be used in the study, and the 
appropriate set-up and use of any study-specific equipment requ ired for evaluation of study-
related endpoints. 
Attendance at an Investigator Meeting is a requirement wherein key training for assessment of 
NMO/NMOSD attacks and other study-specific evaluations and asse ssments will be provided. 
In the event that study site staff are not able to attend the I nvestigator Meeting, alternative 
forums for training will be arranged and documented.  
The Principal Investigator will ensure that appropriate trainin g relevant to the study is given to 
all of these staff, and that any new information relevant to th e performance of this study is 
forwarded to the staff involved. 
The Principal Investigator will maintain a record of all indivi duals involved in the study 
(medical, nursing and other staff). 
6.2 Monitoring of the Study 
During the study, a MedImmune representative will have regular contacts with the study site, 
including visits to: 
x Provide information and support to the investigator(s) 
x Confirm that facilities remain acceptable, including verificati on of MRI settings and 
assessment of environment for ophthalmology examinations 
x Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protoc ol, that data are being 
accurately and timely recorded in the eCRFs, that biological sa mples are handled in 
accordance with the Laboratory Manual and that study drug accou ntability checks are 
being performed 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 124 of 214 x Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in t he eCRFs with the subject’s 
medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study) 
including verification of informed consent of participating sub jects. This will require 
direct access to all original records for each subject (eg, cli nic charts) 
x Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the subject ’s biological samples is 
reported and biological samples are identified and disposed of/ destroyed accordingly, and 
the action is documented, and reported to the subject. 
 
The MedImmune representative will be available between visits i f the investigator(s) or other 
staff at the patient site needs information and advice about th e study conduct. 
6.2.1 Source Data 
Refer to the Clinical Study Agreement for location of source da ta. 
6.2.1.1  Direct Access to Source Data 
The head of the study site and the Principal Investigator/inves tigator will be expected to 
cooperate with all monitoring and auditing conducted by the Spo nsor as well as inspections by 
the IRB/IEC or regulatory authorities. All study documents, suc h as raw data, will be open for 
direct access to source data at the request of the monitor and the auditor of the Sponsor, the 
IRB/IEC, or regulatory authorities.  
To ensure accuracy and completeness of documentation and to ass ure that the Principal 
Investigator has submitted the eCRFs to the Sponsor, the monito r(s) will verify data from the 
eCRFs against source data before the Principal Investigator sig ns the eCRFs. If the 
investigator wishes to amend the submitted eCRFs, the electroni c system will document all 
changes in an electronic audit trail, which will be verified by  the study monitor. 
6.2.2 Study Agreements 
The Principal Investigator at each center should comply with al l the terms, conditions, and 
obligations of the Clinical Study Agreement, or equivalent, for  this study. In the event of any 
inconsistency between this Clinical Study Protocol and the Clin ical Study Agreement, the 
terms of Clinical Study Protocol shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the 
treatment of subjects and in all other respects, not relating t o study conduct or treatment of 
subjects, the terms of the Clinical Study Agreement shall preva il. 
Agreements between MedImmune and the Principal Investigator mus t be in place before any 
study-related procedures can take place, or subjects are enroll ed. 
6.2.3 Archiving of Study Documents 
The investigator follows the principles outlined in the Clinica l Study Agreement. 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 125 of 214 Study Files 
The Sponsor will provide the Principal Investigator with a file  for the organization and 
retention of all study-related documents. All study documents, including letters from the 
Sponsor, should be retained in this file by the Principal Inves tigator. The study monitor will 
regularly check the file to ensure that all relevant documents have been retained. The contents 
of this file may be audited/inspected by the Sponsor’s auditor,  regulatory authorities, or 
IRB/IEC. 
Period of Record Retention 
The study site and the Principal Investigator will retain essen tial documents specified in the 
ICH GCP (eg, source documents such as medical records, contract , signed consent form). 
Essential documents should be retained at the study site for at  least 15 years following 
completion of the study, or in accordance with regulatory oblig ations if longer, and thereafter 
destroyed only after agreement with the Sponsor. In the event o f any inconsistency between 
the above-mentioned contents and the contract with the study si te, the contract shall prevail. If 
the Sponsor requires the documents to be retained for a longer period, the specific period and 
method of retention will be separately discussed between the st udy site and the Sponsor. The 
Sponsor should notify the head of the study site in writing whe n the study-related records are 
no longer needed. The records should be managed by a specific p erson designated by the head 
of the study site. 
6.3 Study Timetable and End of Study 
The end of the study (“study completion”) is defined as the dat e of the last protocol-specified 
visit/assessment (including telephone contact) for the last sub ject in the study. This will occur 
when the last subject completes the 52-week SFP.  
An individual subject will be considered to have completed the RCP if the subject was 
followed through Day 197 or experienced an NMO/NMOSD attack as determined by the AC, 
regardless of the number of doses the subject received. Additio nally, all subjects enrolled in 
the RCP at time that the 67th AC-determined attack is confirmed, or at the time the Sponsor 
discontinues enrollment upon recommendation of the independent DMC based on evidence of 
efficacy and safety, will also be considered as completers, reg ardless of the number of doses 
the subject received, provided the subject completes the Day 19 7/EDV visit. A subject will be 
considered to have completed the OLP if the subject participate d for the duration of the OLP 
as per Section 3.1.1.4. A subject will be considered to have co mpleted the SFP if the subject 
was followed for 52 weeks (12 months) after the last dose of in vestigational product. Subjects 
will be considered not to have completed a study period if cons ent was withdrawn, death 
occurred, or the subject was lost to follow up.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 126 of 214 6.3.1 Discontinuation or Suspension of the Study Program 
If the Sponsor decides to prematurely terminate or suspend the study, the Principal 
Investigator/investigator, head of the study site, and regulato ry authorities should be given 
written notification of the reason(s) for the premature termina tion or suspension of the study. 
The Principal Investigator/investigator will immediately notify  the subjects of this decision, 
provide appropriate medical treatment and take necessary measur es, and record the treatment 
or measures taken on the source documents. 
6.3.2 Completion of the Study 
Upon completion of the study, the Principal Investigator/invest igator will notify the head of 
the study site in writing about the completion of the study as well as the summary of the 
results in accordance with the rule of the study site. Written notification of the results will be 
provided to the IRB and the Sponsor. 
6.4 Data Management 
Data management will be performed by MedImmune Data Management staff according to the 
Data Management Plan. 
Adverse events will be classified according to the terminology of the latest version the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Medicati ons will be classified 
according to the AstraZeneca Drug Dictionary. All coding will b e performed by the Medical 
Coding Team at the MedImmune Data Management Center. 
A Web-Based Data Capture system will be used for data collectio n and query handling. The 
investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs as  specified in the study protocol 
and in accordance with the instructions provided. 
The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeli ness of the data recorded and 
of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Cl inical Study Agreement. The 
investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the compl eted eCRFs will be archived 
at the study site. 
6.5 Medical Monitor Coverage 
Each subject will be provided with contact information for the principal investigator. In 
addition, each subject will receive a toll-free number intended  to provide the subject’s 
physician access to a medical monitor 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the event of an 
emergent situation where the subject’s health is deemed to be a t risk. In this situation, when a 
subject presents to a medical facility where the treating physi cian or health care provider 
requires access to a physician who has knowledge of the investi gational product and the 
clinical study protocol and the Principal Investigator is not a vailable, the treating physician or

a third party vendor. 
7 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
7.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principl es that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with ICH/ GCP, and a pplicable regulatory 
requirements. The applicable regulatory requirements in Japan a re “Good Clinical Practice for 
Trials on Drugs (Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare [MHLW]  Ordinance No. 28, 27 
March 1997, partially revised by MHLW Ordinance and their relat ed notifications.”  
7.2 Subject Data Protection 
The ICF will incorporate (or, in some cases, be accompanied by a separate document 
incorporating) wording that complies with relevant data protect ion and privacy legislation. 
MedImmune will not provide individual genotype results to subje cts, any insurance company, 
any employer, their family members, general physician or any ot her third party, unless 
required to do so by law . 
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and pre vent genetic data being linked to 
the identity of the subject. In exceptional circumstances, howe ver, certain individuals might 
see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a sub ject. For example, in the case of a 
medical emergency, a MedImmune Medical Monitor or an investigat or might know a 
subject’s identity and also have access to his or her genetic d ata. Also Regulatory authorities 
may require access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the 
genetic files would remain physically separate.  
7.3 Ethics and Regulatory Review 
An IRB/IEC should approve the final study protocol, including t he final version of the ICF 
and any other written information and/or materials to be provid ed to the subjects. The 
investigator will ensure the distribution of these documents to  the applicable IRB/IEC, and to 
the study site staff. 
The opinion of the IRB/IEC should be given in writing. The inve stigator should submit the 
written approval to MedImmune before enrollment of any subject into the study.  
The IRB/IEC should approve all advertising used to recruit subj ects for the study. 
MedImmune should approve any modifications to the ICF that are needed to meet local 
requirements. 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 128 of 214 If required by local regulations, the protocol should be re-app roved by the IRB/IEC annually. 
Before enrollment of any subject into the study, the final stud y protocol, including the final 
version of the ICF, is approved by the national regulatory auth ority or a notification to the 
national regulatory authority is done, according to local regul ations. 
MedImmune (or local country representative) will handle the dis tribution of any of these 
documents to the national regulatory authorities. 
MedImmune (or local country representative) will provide Regula tory Authorities, IRB/IEC 
and Principal Investigators with safety updates/reports accordi ng to local requirements, 
including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR s), where relevant. 
Each Principal Investigator is responsible for providing the IR B/IEC with reports of any 
serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other st udy conducted with the 
investigational product. MedImmune (or local country representa tive) will provide this 
information to the Principal Investigator so that he/she can me et these reporting requirements.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the  opinion is sought from the 
IRB/IEC, with respect to the appropriateness of continuing the study at the study site as per 
the local IRB/IEC requirements.  
A valid contract between the study site and the Sponsor should be signed before the 
investigator can enroll any subject into the study.  
7.3.1 Ethics and Regulatory Review in Japan 
In addition, in Japan the head of the study site should submit a notification of 
direction/determination as well as IRB written approval to the Sponsor and the Principal 
Investigator before enrollment of any subject into the study.  
The Principal Investigator should submit progress reports to th e IRB via the head of the study 
site at the time of any protocol reapproval.  
7.4 Informed Consent 
The Principal Investigator(s) at each center  will: 
x Ensure each subject is given full and adequate oral and written  information about the 
nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study 
x Ensure each subject is notified that they are free to discontin ue from the study at any time 
x Ensure that each subject is given the opportunity to ask questi ons and allowed time to 
consider the information provided 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 129 of 214 x Ensure each subject provides signed and dated informed consent before conducting any 
procedure specifically for the study 
x Ensure the original, signed ICF(s) is/are stored in the Investi gator’s Study File 
x Ensure a copy of the signed ICF is given to the subject 
x Ensure that any incentives for subjects who participate in the study as well as any 
provisions for subjects harmed as a consequence of study partic ipation are described in 
the ICF that is approved by an IRB/IEC. 
 
If any new information about the investigational product become s available that may 
influence the subject’s decision to continue in the study, the investigator(s) should 
immediately inform the subject of such information, record this  in written form, and confirm 
with the subject if he/she wishes to continue participating in the study. In addition, if the 
investigator(s) deems it necessary to revise the ICF, it should  be revised immediately (see 
Section 7.5) and the updated ICF should be explained to the sub ject, even if the subject(s) has 
been informed verbally about the new ICF. Written informed cons ent for the subject to 
continue participating in the study should be provided separate ly. 
7.5 Changes to the Protocol and Informed Consent Form 
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreeme nt of the medical monitor, 
Principal Investigator, and MedImmune. 
If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, the n these changes will be 
documented in a study protocol amendment and where required in a new version of the study 
protocol. The amendment is to be approved by the relevant IRB/I EC and if applicable, also the 
national regulatory authority approval, before implementation. Local requirements are to be 
followed for revised protocols. 
MedImmune will distribute any subsequent amendments and new ver sions of the protocol to 
each Principal Investigator(s). For distribution to IRB/IEC see  Section 7.3. 
If a protocol amendment requires a change to a site’s ICF, MedI mmune and the site’s 
IRB/IEC are to approve the revised ICF before the revised form is used.  
If local regulations require, any administrative change will be  communicated to or approved 
by each IRB/IEC. 
7.5.1 Deviation From the Clinical Study Protocol 
The investigator(s) must not deviate from or make any changes t o the protocol without 
documented agreement between the Principal Investigator and the  Sponsor or IRB/IEC 
approval, based on deliberations. This shall not apply to cases  where the deviation or change 
is necessary to avoid an immediate hazard to the subjects, for other compelling medical 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 130 of 214 reasons, or where the changes involve only logistical or admini strative aspects of the clinical 
study (eg, changes to the organization/structure of MedImmune, the name/department of the 
study site, the address or phone number of the study site or Sp onsor, and the job title of the 
investigator or medical monitor).  
The investigator(s) should document any and all deviations from  the protocol regardless of the 
reason(s). Unless the deviation occurred to avoid an immediate hazard to the subjects or for 
other medically compelling reason(s), the investigator should p repare and submit the records 
explaining the reason(s) for the deviation(s) to MedImmune and the head of the study site and 
retain a copy of the records.  
The investigator(s) may deviate from or make a change to the pr otocol without documented 
agreement between the Principal Investigator and MedImmune or I RB approval only in the 
event of a medical emergency (eg, to avoid an immediate hazard to the subjects). In such 
cases, the Principal Investigator must notify MedImmune, the he ad of the study site, and the 
IRB as soon as possible about the details of the deviation or c hange, the reason for the 
deviation, and a proposed revision in the protocol, if required , to obtain their approval. For 
study sites in Japan, a certificate of approval by the head of the study site as well as the 
Sponsor should be obtained via the head of the study site. 
7.6 Audits and Inspections 
All study data may be subject to a reliability review and onsit e GCP inspection by the 
regulatory authorities.  
Authorized representatives of MedImmune, a regulatory authority , or an IRB/IEC may 
perform audits or inspections at the center, including source d ata verification. The purpose of 
an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently e xamine all study-related 
activities and documents, to determine whether these activities  were conducted, and data were 
recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the pr otocol, GCP, ICH guidelines, 
and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator wi ll contact MedImmune 
immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspec tion at the site.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 136 of 214 9 CHANGES TO THE PROTOCOL 
All changes described below have been incorporated into the cur rent version of the protocol. 
Protocol Amendment 6; 11Oct2018 
The primary purpose of this amendment was to introduce language  related to changes in the 
study resulting from the Sponsor’s decision to accept recommend ations from the independent 
DMC, based on evidence of efficacy and safety, to stop study en rollment and allow subjects in 
the RCP at that time the option to enter the OLP. In addition, minor copy-editing and 
formatting issues were corrected throughout the document. Chang es to the protocol reflecting 
the change above were made throughout the protocol (Synopsis, S ections 3.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 
4.8, and 6.3, and Table 2).  
Protocol Amendment 5; 16Jul2018 
Text revisions resulting from this amendment are incorporated i n the body of Protocol 
Amendment 5. This amendment incorporates numerous administrativ e and personnel changes, 
corrects existing errors, and updates definitions and processes  for safety reporting. Table and 
figure numbering was changed to sequential numbering to align w ith the new in-house 
authoring style. Minor copy editing and formatting were correct ed throughout the document. 
Major changes to the protocol were as follows:  
1 Title Page: The medical monitor was changed from ,  to  
, , along with contact information. 
2 Synopsis and Section 3.1.1 (Overview), Section 3.1.1.1 (Screeni ng Period), Section 4.1.1 
(Number of Subjects), Section 4.2.1 (Enrollment/Screening Perio d), and Section 4.8.2 
(Sample Size and Power Calculations): Text was added to these s ections to clarify that 
enrollment of subjects into the study will stop when a total of  67 AC-determined NMOSD 
attacks have occurred or when 252 subjects have been randomized  and dosed , whichever 
occurs first, to account for subjects that are randomized but d o not receive investigational 
product. 
3 Section 4.1.2 (Inclusion Criteria), Table 4 (Highly Effective M ethods of Contraception): 
Removed incorrect abbreviation for intrauterine hormone-releasi ng system and 
duplication of “injectable”. 
4 Section 4.1.3 (Exclusion Criteria): Exclusion Criterion 12 was revised to add the 
stipulation that rituximab treatment with 6 months prior to scr eening is not exclusionary 
if a subject has B-cell counts above the LLN, since the reason for excluding rituximab 
within the prior 6 months is the possibility of low B cells. Ex clusion Criterion19 was 
revised to read, “or” instead of “and” with reference to therap ies for concurrent 
autoimmune disease. PPD PPD

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 137 of 214 5 Section 4.2.1 (Enrollment/Screening Period), Table 5 (Schedule of Screening 
Procedures): Order of footnote references was corrected.  
6 Section 4.2.2.1 (Randomized-controlled Treatment Period), Table  6 (Schedule of 
Randomized-controlled Treatment Period Study Procedures); Secti on 4.2.2.2 (Open-
label Period), Table 7 (Schedule of Open-label Period Study Pro cedures); and Section 
4.5.1.2 (Treatment Administration), Randomized-controlled Perio d: The window for the 
Day 15 visit (for both RCP and OLP) was changed from + 3 days t o r days, which 
provides scheduling flexibility to the sites and is anticipated  to have no consequence on 
the pharmacodynamic effect or safety of the drug. 
7 Section 4.2.2.2 (Open-label Period), Table 7 (Schedule of Open- label Period Study 
Procedures): Urine pregnancy tests for Weeks 13 and 39/then Q26 W visits were 
removed as these are not required because the subjects are not dosed at these visits.  
8 Section 4.3.1.2 (Neuroaxis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan), MR I for All Subjects: 
Text was added to stipulate that brain MRI review by the Princi pal Investigator is 
acceptable in the event of a safety alert of new brain lesion(s ) from the central MRI 
reader. 
9 Section 4.3.1.4 (Expanded Disability Status Scale and Functiona l Systems Scores): Text 
was revised to remove “face-to-face” as not all training is con ducted person-to-person. 
10 Section 4.7.2 (Prohibited Concomitant Medications): Text was ad ded that low-dose 
steroid may be permissible if discussed and agreed with the med ical monitor, as in some 
situations low-dose steroid administration will have no impact on the NMO disease 
course. Also added prohibition of any other immunosuppressant m edication (beyond 
those already named) unless discussed and approved by the medic al monitor.  
11 Section 5.5 (Reporting of Serious Adverse Events): Information for SAE reporting was 
updated following a change of service provider. 
12 Section 5.6.1 (Overdose): The definition of overdose was expand ed to include receipt of 
investigational product at a time/visit not specified in the pr otocol; information for 
overdose reporting was updated. 
13 Section 5.6.2 (Hepatic Function Abnormality): Text was revised to specify that all 
occurrences of Hy’s Law are to be considered SAEs and are to be  reported to the 
Sponsor according to SAE reporting procedures. 
14 Section 5.6.3 (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy): Pro cess and information 
for reporting possible cases of PML were updated. 
15 Section 5.6.4 (Pregnancy): Information for pregnancy reporting was updated. 
16 Appendix 1 (Signatures): Text was updated to remove Jorn Drappa , MD and replace 
with Eliezer Katz, MD FACS for sponsor signature.  
 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 138 of 214 Protocol Amendment 4; 08Mar2017 
Text revisions resulting from this amendment are incorporated i n the body of Protocol 
Amendment 4. The primary reasons for changes included in Amendm ent 4 are the removal of 
the sample size reassessment and the inclusion of clear guidanc e that stopping enrollment is 
based on the occurrence of 67 AC-determined NMOSD attacks or wh en 252 subjects have 
been enrolled. Minor edits were also addressed.   
1 Protocol Synopsis: Revisions were made to the synopsis to refle ct changes in the body of 
the protocol amendment.  
2 Section 1.4 (Summary of Clinical Experience): Text was updated that Study CD-IA-
MEDI-551-1102 has now been completed. Additionally, text was ad ded that PML has 
been reported in the setting of B-cell depleting therapies and other immunosuppressive 
regimens and is a potential risk of treatment with MEDI-551. A subject in Study CD-IA-
MEDI-551-1155 developed altered mental state, seizures, and new  brain lesions that on 
brain MRI raised suspicion of PML. CSF testing for JCV was perf ormed, with 
inconclusive results (two negative results in reference laborat ories and one positive result 
in a local labarotory). Brain tissue was not available for exam ination. The subject died 
from cardiopulmonary complications. Based on all available data , the differential 
diagnosis included ADEM, atypical NMOSD attack, and PML. No con clusive diagnosis 
could be made. This text was added to provide investigators and  others with the latest 
and most complete information regarding this potential safety r isk.  
3 Section 3.1.1 (Overview): Text was changed to a maximum of 252 subjects with 
NMO/NMOSD will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive IV MEDI- 551 (300 mg at 
Day 1 and 300 mg at Day 15) or placebo for a period of 197 days  (RCP). Text was added 
that enrollment of subjects into the study will stop when a tot al of 67 AC-determined 
NMOSD attacks occur or when 252 subjects have been randomized, whichever occurs 
first. For this and all related changes in this amendment, the removal of the interim 
sample size reassessment resulted from discussion with the FDA regarding the timing of 
the sample size reassessment as related to the futility analysi s. As the study progresses it 
becomes possible that the futility analysis will occur prior to  the sample size 
reassessment, which would not allow for the performing of the s ample size reassessment. 
Therefore an agreement was reached with the FDA for the removal  of the sample size 
reassessment from the protocol and increasing the sample size t o 252 subjects (or until 
67 AC-determined NMOSD attacks have occurred).  
4 Section 3.1.1.1 (Screening Period): Text was added that subject s who are in screening at 
the time that 252 subjects are randomized will not be randomize d into the study. This 
condition was added to prevent additional subject exposure to p otential risks of the study 
beyond that required by the protocol objectives.  
5 Figure 3.1.1-1 (Study Flow Diagram): The study flow diagram was  revised to update the 
sample size to 252 subjects. 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 139 of 214 6 Section 3.1.1.2 (Randomization [Day 1]): The maximum number of subjects to be 
randomized was changed from 212 to 252. 
7 Section 3.1.1.3 (Randomized-controlled Period [Day 1 to Day 197 ]): New text was 
added to clarify that subjects who are in the RCP when a total of 67 AC-determined 
NMOSD attacks have occurred will discontinue the RCP within 14 days and be given 
the option to enroll into the OLP. Management of subjects who d o not discontinue within 
14 days should be discussed with the medical monitor. This cond ition was added to 
prevent additional subject exposure to the potential risks of t he study beyond that 
required by the protocol objectives. 
8 Section 3.1.1.4 (Open-label Period): Text was minimally revised  for Criterion #2 and 
Criterion #3 was added that subjects will be given the option t o enter the OLP if they are 
in the RCP at the time 67 AC-determined attacks have occurred. Text was revised to 
clarify that subjects who discontinue from the RCP for reasons other than an 
NMO/NMOSD attack or the occurrence of 67 AC-determined attacks will not be eligible 
for the OLP. 
9 Section 3.1.2 (Treatment Regimen) / Open-label Period: Text was  added to clarify that 
dosing of subjects enrolling into the OLP following an adjudica ted NMO/NMOSD 
attack, and following the occurrence of the 67th adjudicated NM O/NMOSD attack, will 
be identical to the OLP dosing regimen.  
10 Section 4.1.1 (Number of Subjects): New text was added that the  study is event driven 
where the primary objective is based on a total of 67 AC-determ ined NMO/NMOSD 
attacks. Because the sample size reassessment was removed from the protocol a 
calculated assessment was performed to determine the number of patients needed to be 
randomized to reach 67 AC-adjudicated NMOSD attacks. As the rat e of NMO/NMOSD 
attacks is not established in the literature, the attack rate w as analyzed based on masked 
data from the first 78 subjects who completed the RCP in this s tudy. The attack status 
(attack/no attack) of the 78 subjects was randomly sampled with  different attack rates, 
which gave an estimate of the number of attacks for the total s ample size. This 
simulation process was repeated 10,000 times to give a distribu tion of the number of 
attacks for the total sample size, from which the probability o f observing at least 67 
attacks could be estimated. Based on the 78 completed subjects,  this procedure showed 
that with a sample size of 227 there is a 50% probability of re aching the required 67 AC-
determined attacks and with 252 subjects there is a 90% probabi lity of reaching the 
required 67 AC-determined attacks. The sample size of 252 subje cts was selected to give 
a high degree of confidence that 67 attacks will be observed in  this study. Enrollment of 
subjects into the study will stop when a total of 67 AC-determi ned NMOSD attacks 
occur or when 252 subjects have been randomized, whichever occu rs first. 
11 Section 4.1.2 (Inclusion Criteria): Criteria #6b, 7, and 8 were  revised to add text and new 
table (Table 4.1.2-1, Highly Effective Methods of Contraception ) to emphasize that 
nonsterilized sexually active males with female partners of chi ldbearing potential and 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 140 of 214 sterilized males must use a condom plus spermicide. It is stron gly recommended that 
female partners of male subjects to also use a highly effective  method of contraception 
throughout this period. 
12 Section 4.1.7 (Replacement of Subjects): Text mentioning sample  size reassessment was 
removed as this will not be conducted. 
13 Section 4.2.1 (Enrollment/Screening Period): Text was added for  clarification and 
consistency with other sections that subjects undergoing screen ing at the time 252 
subjects are randomized may not be randomized into the study an d the management of 
these subjects should be discussed with the medical monitor. Si milarly, subjects in 
screening at the time of the 67th AC-determined attack will not be randomized. The 
screening period may be extended to allow for repeat procedures .  
14 Section 4.2.2.1 (Randomized-controlled Treatment Period): Text was added to clarify 
that at the time 67 AC-determined attacks have occurred, the sp onsor will notify all sites 
and the sites will notify subjects ongoing in the RCP that they  must discontinue within 
14 days and should be given the option to enroll into the OLP. Procedures should be 
conducted as presented in the Schedule of Randomized-controlled  Treatment Period 
Procedures for the Day 197/ EDV; however, subjects who have had  an MRI in the last 
3 months need NOT repeat the MRI to reduce the burden on the su bjects. Subjects who 
decide to enroll into the OLP will follow procedures of the OLP  as presented in 
Table 4.2.2.2-1 (Schedule of Open-label Period Study Procedures ). This time limit on 
discontinuation of the RCP is to ensure the timely completion o f the study and to prevent 
any delay in continued receipt of study medication in the OLP, if subjects choose to 
enroll. 
15 Section 4.2.2.2 (Open-label Period): Text was added to clarify that subjects who are in 
the RCP at the time of the 67th AC-determined attack and want to enroll in the OLP must 
do so within 2 weeks of the occurrence of the 67th attack. This time limit on 
discontinuation of the RCP is to ensure the timely completion o f the study and to prevent 
any delay in continued receipt of study medication in the OLP, if subjects choose to 
enroll. 
16 Table 4.2.2.2-1 (Schedule of Open-label Period Study Procedures ): Text relating to the 
follow-up telephone calls has been removed as these calls are n ot necessary. The purpose 
of these calls was to mitigate against the risks of placebo use . As there is no placebo in 
the OLP these calls place an unnecessary burden on sites and su bjects. Footnote “b” was 
updated to delete text that PK samples would be collected at se lected sites only. 
17 Section 4.3.1.1 (Identification, Assessment, and Adjudication o f an NMO/NMOSD 
Attack): Text amended to remove the need for follow-up telephon e calls to subjects 
during the OLP. 
18 Section 4.3.1.2 (Neuroaxis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan): Te xt added to state that 
subjects who discontinue the RCP at the time of the 67th AC-determined attack need not

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 141 of 214 have an MRI repeated if the last one was done within 3 months t o reduce the burden on 
the subjects 
19 Section 4.3.3.2 (Physical and Neurological Examination): Text w as added for 
clarification that additional neurological exams may be conduct ed according to local 
practice. 
20 Section 4.3.5 (Modified Rankin Scale): Text indicating that the  Principal Investigator 
will evaluate the mRS was removed as this assessment may be don e by any trained and 
designated member of the site team. 
21 Section 4.3.6 (Clinical Laboratory Tests) / Other Safety Tests:  Bullet point and text were 
added to further clarify that only in cases of suspected PML, a  CSF sample for JCV 
DNA PCR will be collected and frozen immediately. 
22 Section 4.3.9.1 (Exploratory Investigations) / Serum for Explor atory Biomarker Studies: 
The last sentence in the subsection was revised to correct that  the presence of 
autoantibodies to antigens other than AQP4 may be explored thro ughout the study. 
Additionally, the subsection, Blood for Peripheral Blood Mononu clear Cell Isolation for 
T-cell Evaluation was removed as it is not feasible to manage t hese samples within the 
required stability window. 
23 Table 4.3.10-1 (Estimate of Blood Volume to be Collected): Bloo d volumes for PBMC 
sample collection was removed from table and footnotes as PBMC will not be collected. 
24 Section 4.5.1.2 (Treatment Administration) / Open-label Period:  Text was revised for 
consistency with other sections that subjects who are in the RC P at the time of 67th AC-
determined attack is achieved must enter the OLP within two wee ks of the occurrence of 
the 67th attack, unless there is a compelling reason that is discussed and agreed with the 
medical monitor, in which case a short extension may be granted . 
25 Section 4.7.1.1 (Immunosuppressive Medications During the Scree ning Period): Text 
was removed regarding the treatment of an NMO/NMOSD attack in s creening as this is 
no longer consistent with Section 4.2.1, which requires that su bjects experiencing an 
attack in the screening period be screen failures. 
26 Section 4.8.2 (Sample Size and Power Calculations): Text revise d for consistency with 
other sections that a maximum number of 252 subjects will be ra ndomized. The sample 
size is based on a masked calculation of the attack rate for th e first 78 subjects to 
complete the RCP and a simulation based on this attack rate tha t indicates a > 90% 
probability of achieving the required 67 AC-determined attacks with 252 subjects. Text 
mentioning masked sample size reassessment was removed as this will not be done.  
27 Section 4.8.3.1 (Primary Efficacy Analysis): Text was revised t o clarify and for 
consistency with other sections that the data cutoff date for t he primary analysis will be  
when the last subject completes the discontinuation visit follo wing the 67th 
AC-determined attack, or after all subjects complete the RCP if  67 AC-determined

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 142 of 214 attacks do not occur. Subjects who are in the RCP when a total of 67 AC-determined 
NMOSD attacks have occurred will discontinue the RCP within 14 days.  
28 Section 4.8.10.1 (Masked Sample Size Reassessment): This sectio n was removed as the 
reassessment will not be conducted.  
29 Section 5.3 (Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest):  Text was added and 
revised to clarify that 2 AEs will be considered AESIs for this  study: 1) hepatic function 
abnormality meeting the definition of Hy’s Law, and 2) PML.  
30 Section 5.6.3 (Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy): Sec tion and text were 
added indicating that PML is an AESI and a potential risk for M EDI-551 and that 
confirmation for PML diagnosis requires the presence of JVC in CSF or brain tissue 
biopsy sample, any suspected case of PML should be immediately reported to the 
sponsor and discussed with the medical monitor, and the medical  monitor should be 
contacted for instruction on proper handling of subject samples  and analysis in the case 
of potential PML. Sample transfer procedures are critical to en sure accurate test results, 
and the sponsor wishes to be involved in these processes to ens ure appropriate 
procedures are followed. 
31 Section 6.3 (Study Timetable and End of Study): Text was added to clarify subject 
completion of the RCP. Any subject in the RCP at the time of th e 67th AC-determined 
attack will be considered as having completed the RCP regardles s of the doses the 
subject received.  
32 Appendix 9 (Sample Size Calculation): Text was added to align w ith changes in 
Section 4.8.2 and provide explanation that the originally plann ed masked interim sample 
size reassessment was removed from the protocol as a result of a discussion with the 
FDA regarding the timing of the sample size reassessment as rel ated to the futility 
analysis. As the study progresses it becomes possible that the futility analysis will occur 
prior to the sample size reassessment, which would not allow th e sample size 
reassessment to be performed. Therefore an agreement was reache d with the FDA that 
the sample size reassessment would be removed from the protocol . The sample size was 
also increased to a maximum number of 252 randomized subjects t o provide a high 
degree of confidence that 67 NMO/NMOSD attacks will be observed  in the study.  
33 Appendix 11 (Details of Masked Sample Size Reassessment): Text and table (Table 9-5,

this reassessment will not be conducted. 
 
Protocol Amendment 3; 18Oct2016 
Text revisions resulting from this amendment are incorporated i n the body of Protocol 
Amendment 3. These changes were primarily made to provide addit ional clarification.  
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 143 of 214 1 Section 4.1.3 (Exclusion Criteria), Criterion 10g: Text was cla rified to make it clear that 
the criterion refers to CD19+ B cell counts.  
2 Section 4.2.1 (Enrollment/Screening Period) and Section 4.3.1.2  (Neuroaxis Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging Scan): Text added to allow the use of a previ ous MRI scan as part of 
the screening assessment for subjects that are being re-screene d to prevent those subjects 
having to go through a lengthy and uncomfortable procedure if t he previous MRI was 
done in the last 3 months. The sponsor has consulted with an ex pert on the matter and 
confirmed that MRI can be used for up to 3 months as the basis for the evaluation of 
eligibility, therefore this change which will only apply to a m inimal number of subjects, 
will have not impact on the integrity of the protocol. 
3 Section 4.2.1 (Enrollment/Screening Period): The opportunity fo r a subject to undergo 
one additional re-sceen has been introduced to ensure that a su bject is not unreasonably 
excluded for reasons that would not prevent the subject from sa fely participating in the 
study or that would not impact the integrity of the study. This  will not include subjects 
that have failed to meet entry criteria twice rather subjects t hat have not been able to 
enter for logistical reasons such as lab results not reported i n the screening window. As 
such there is no impact on the subject population. 
4 Section 4.3.1.3 (Independent Ophthalmology Assessments): wordin g related to the order 
of assessments has been removed to ensure consistency with chan ges made in protocol 
amendment 2 as the deletion of this text was overlooked in erro r when amendment 2 was 
created. 
Low and High Contrast Visual Acuity: following advice from expe rt ophthalmologists, 
clarification on when the high and low contrast visual acuity a ssessments should stop has 
been added to the protocol. The clarification is consistent wit h standard ophthalmology 
practice. 
5 Section 4.3.1.4 (Expanded Disability Status Scale and Functiona l Systems Scores): 
Neurostatus as the name of the EDSS vendor was removed from the  text as this group is 
no longer engaged with this study.  
Wording related to the order of assessments ha sbeen removed to  ensure consistency with 
changes made in protocol amendment 2 as deletion of this text w as overlooked in error 
when the amendment was created. 
6 Section 4.3.6 (Clinical Laboratory Tests): Coagulation paramete rs were added to the 
hematology panel as these are currently being evaluated as part  of this panel and were 
omitted in error. 
7 Table 4.3.10.1 (Estimate of Blood Volume to be Collected): bloo d volumes for the 
Attack Follow-up Visit and total blood volume were corrected.  
8 Table 4.5.1-1 (Identification of Investigational Products): The  amount of polysorbate 80 
in the investigational product was corrected to 0.01% (w/v). 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 144 of 214 9 Section 4.8.3.1 (Primary Analyses) and Section 4.8.3.2 (Additio nal Analyses of the 
Primary Endpoint): During discussions with the FDA the window i n which attacks are 
assessed was discussed. It is essential for the quality of the data and patient safety that 
potential attacks are assessed as quickly as possible. The prot ocol therefore specifies a 3 
day window for subjects to come into the site and a further 5 d ays for assessments to be 
completed. However the sponsor and the FDA agreed that a wider window will apply for 
the statisticial analysis of the primary endpoint analysis to p revent valid attacks being 
excluded from the analysis. A sensitivity analysis to assess th e impact of the loss of 
events outside of the identified assessment window was also add ed. The operational 
windows for management of subjects with potential attacks has n ot changed and there is 
no impact on the management of the subjects.  
10 Section 4.8.10.2 (Futility Assessment) and Appendix 10 (Details  of Futility Analysis): 
Text was clarified to provide further information on how the fu tility assessment will be 
performed. 
11 Section 8 (References) additional references included in this a mendment have been 
added. 
 
Protocol Amendment 2; 10Dec2015 
Text revisions resulting from this amendment are incorporated i n the body of Protocol 
Amendment 2. The majority of these changes were primarily made for clarification to text and 
tables.  
1 Protocol Synopsis and Section 3.1.1.1 (Screening Period), Secti on 3.2.3 (Rationale for 
Study Population), Section 4.1.2 (Inclusion Criteria), Criterio n #3b, and Section 4.2.1 
(Enrollment/Screening Period): Text was amended to clarify that  eligibility of AQP4-
IgG seronegative subjects will be determined by an independent eligibility committee to 
reflect actual practice. 
2 Protocol Synopsis, Section 3.1.1 (Overview), 3.1.1.4 (Open-labe l Period), 4.2.2.2 
(Open-label Period), and Table 3.1.2-2 (Open-label Period Treat ment Regimen), 
footnote “a”: Text was added or revised to clarify that subject s may exit the OLP at any 
time for any reason, including seeking alternative treatment op tions; this text 
modification was made in response to European Medicines Agency scientific advice. 
3 Protocol Synopsis and Section 3.1.1.1 (Randomized-controlled Pe riod (Day 1 to 
Day 197): Text was revised to clarify tht assessment of new sym ptoms or worsening of 
exisiting symptoms should be completed within 5 days to determi ne if an attack has 
occurred.  
4 Protocol Synopsis and Section 4.1.1 (Number of Subjects), Secti on 4.1.7 (Replacement 
of Subjects), and Section 4.8.2 (Sample Size and Power Calculat ions): Text was revised 
to clarify that the study is event driven and enrollment of sub jects will stop when a total 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 145 of 214 of 67 AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks occur. The planned number  of subjects to 
be enrolled is 212; however, based on sample size reassessment the number maybe 
increased to a maximum of 252 subjects. 
5 Protocol Synopis, Section 4.8.10.1 (Masked Sample Size Reassess ment), and Appendix 
11 (Details of Masked Sample Size Reassessment  ): Text was added for clarification that 
the study population may be increased up to 252 subjects if the  ratio of the cumulative 
number of AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks to subject ratio is a pproximately 27% 
or less.  
6 Section 1.4 (Summary of Clinical Experience): Text was revised to update the current 
statuses of clinical studies to align with the updated IB. 
7 Section 3.1.1.2 (Randomization [Day 1]): Text was added to clar ify that Day 1 is to 
occur within 28 days of the start of the screening period.  
8 Section 3.1.1.5 (Safety Follow-Up Period): Text was added to al ign with the Czech 
Republic Local Protocol Amendment 1 as this is applicable globa lly; “During the SFP, a 
subject may receive standard treatment for their NMO/NMOSD at t he discretion of the 
investigator.” 
9 Section 3.2.4.2 (Secondary Endpoints): Subsection for Vaccine T iters and reference were 
added to provide the rationale for measuring anti-tetanus vacci ne titers as one of the 
laboratory measures for the safety and tolerability of MEDI-551 . 
10 Section 4.1.2 (Inclusion Criteria), Criteria #3b, #4, #6, #7 an d #8: Criterion #3b was 
revised to clarify that data from AQP4-IgG subjects will be rev iewed by an independent 
eligibility committee to confirm eligibility. Criterion #4 was revised to remove wording 
related to relapses in the screening period since these subject s should now be screen 
failed. Also, the time that subjects must be stable or improvin g prior to randomization 
was changed from at least  2 weeks to at least 4 weeks to ensur e that the subject is 
appropriately managed and ensure there is less chance of an att ack continuing. Criteria 
#6 and #7 were added to align with local requirements for the C zech Republic. Criterion 
#8 spelling was corrected to clarify that the criterion applies  to males without appropriate 
post-vasectomy documentation. 
11 Section 4.1.3 (Exclusion Criteria), Criteria #3, #10g, #12, #23 a, and #24: The text for 
Criterion #3 was revised to remove “at risk of developing nephr ogenic systemic fibrosis 
after receiving gadolinium (Gd)-containing contrast agents” as all subjects with a score 
of less than 60 mL/minute may be at risk for developing nephrog enic systemic fibrosis 
and will be excluded. Criterion #10g was added to clarify that all subjects with B cells 
below the LLN are excluded as Criterion #12 applies only to sub jects on rituximab; 
however, the same safety concerns apply regardless of prior med ications. Criterion #12 
was modified to add text to exclude subjects using rituximab in  the 6 months prior to 
screening as experience to date shows that B cells have not usu ally recovered to the LLN 
within this time frame. The text reference to B cells was remov ed as this is now covered 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 146 of 214 by Criterion #10g. Criterion #23a was modified to lower the tot al Ig value that is 
exclusionary as it was unnecessarily restrictive. The LLNs of t he most abundant Igs (A, 
G, M) total to approximately 665 mg/dL, a further 10% under thi s does not constitute 
hypoglobulinemia. Criterion #24 text was added to clarify how h epatitis B and hepatitis 
C serology will be managed. In cases where the surface antigen is negative and the core 
antibody is positive, the presence of surface antibody will per mit entry as it signifies that 
the subject is immune to hepatitis B, where the absence of surf ace antibody signifies that 
the subject is at risk of having hepatitis B. 
12 Section 4.1.4.1 (Enrollment): Text was revised to clarify that re-screened subjects will 
receive a new SID number to reflect actual practice with the IN RS/IWRS. 
13 Section 4.1.5 (Withdrawal from the Study): Text was added to cl arify that subjects at 
sites in the Czech Republic may discontinue investigational pro duct following an EDV 
and enter the SFP if the subject agrees to enter the SFP, unles s they are lost to follow up 
or enrolled in another clinical study.  
14 Section 4.2.1 (Enrollment/Screening Period): Text in this secti on was revised for the 
following reasons: 1) to allow procedures after consent is sign ed to be conducted in any 
order to give greater flexibility in scheduling the large numbe r of study procedures; 2) to 
remove text to extend the screening period in the event that a subject has an NMO attack 
to ensure that subjects are appropriately stabilized prior to e ntry to the study; 3) to clarify 
that any subject who cannot be assessed in the 28-day screening  period or experiences an 
NMO/NMOSD relapse, must be withdrawn and screen failed, and tha t any subject who 
is screen failed may be rescreened one further time, unless the ir participation would 
exceed the 80:20 ration; 4) to clarify that blood samples for s erum chemistry and 
hematology must be redrawn in the event that screening is exten ded to ensure that safety 
laboratory results are up-to-date in the 28 days prior to rando mization. 
15 Table 4.2.1-1 (Schedule of Screening Procedures): The table was  modified for the 
following reasons: 1) blood samples for Total Ig, IgM, IgG, IgA , and IgE were added to 
the assessments to align with Administrative Change 1; 2) the o phthalmology assessment 
was revised to clarify that this should be an independent asses sment; and 3) Footnote “d” 
was added to clarify that if the EDSS and C-SSRS are conducted by the same person that 
the EDSS should be performed first. This is the case at some si tes and conducting the 
assessments in this same order will eliminate potential EDSS ra ter bias resulting from 
information gathered during the C-SSRS assessment. 
16 Section 4.2.1.1 (Eligibility Committee): New section was added to clarify that an 
independent Eligibility Committee will determine if subjects wh o are AQP4-IgG 
negative meet the Wingerchuk et al, 2006 criteria for NMO.  
17 Section 4.2.2.1 (Randomized-controlled Treatment Period): Text was revised for the 
following reasons: 1) to clarify that the randomization on Day 1 must occur within 
28 days of the start of the screening period, unless screening is extended; 2) to explain 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 147 of 214 the principle for ordering procedures to facilitate efficient c onduct of the visit, including 
the conduct of the visit over 2 days; and 3) to remove text reg arding an NMO attack at 
the randomization visit as it is now covered in the previous se ction. 
18 Table 4.2.2.1-1 (Schedule of Randomized-controlled Treatment Pe riod Study 
Procedures): The table was modified for the following reasons: 1) Ig samples were 
removed for Day 1, Week 0 assessments to align with Administrat ive Change 1; 2) the 
ophthalmology assessment was revised to clarify that this shoul d be an independent 
assessment; 3) footnote “e” was revised to claify that the subj ect should be treated for the 
attack as required, screen failed, and then reassessed; 4) foot note ‘h’ was added to clarify 
that if the EDSS and C-SSRS are conducted by the same person th e EDSS should be 
done first to eliminate the possibility of bias; 5) footnote “i ” was added to clarify that the 
randomization visit may be split over 2 days to accommodate the  number of study 
procedures; and 6) footnote “j”was added to clarify that tetanu s vaccine titers will be 
tested at Day 1 for all subjects and that with negative results  will not continue to be 
tested but those who test positive will continue to be tested a t specified titer time points; 
and 7) footnote “k” was added to clarify that if the second dos e of investigational 
product is delayed due to medical/safety reasons, dosing must b e discussed with the 
medical monitor prior to administration of investigational prod uct to ensure all subjects 
have the same opportunity to receive investigational product.  
19 Section 4.2.2.2 (Open-label Period): Text was revised or added for the following 
reasons: 1) explain the principle for ordering procedures to fa cilitate efficient conduct of 
the visit; 2) to allow some flexibility in the time for subject s completing the RCP without 
an NMO/NMOSD attack to enter the OLP in the event that there is  a safety issue; and 3) 
to increase the time period in which subjects who experience an  AC-determined 
NMO/NMOSD attack have to enter the OLP to ensure that subjects are not unfairly 
excluded in the event that it may require a number of weeks for  stabilization with rescue 
medication. Managing acute attacks with rescue medications is e xpected to prevent 
further NMO/NMOSD attacks. 
20 Table 4.2.2.2-1 (Schedule of Open-label Period Study Procedures ): The table was 
modified for the following reasons: 1) footnote “d” was revised  to clarify that if any part 
of the neuroaxis MRI was not done at the time of the Assessment  Visit, it should be 
conducted at Day 1 of the OLP, otherwise it is not required; 2)  footnote “g” was added to 
clarify that investigational product will not be given if the s ubject is undergoing an EDV; 
3) footnote “h” was added to clarify that if the EDSS and C-SSR S are conducted by the 
same person the EDSS should be performed first to eliminate pot ential bias; 4) footnote 
“i” was added to clarify that in the event that the second dose  of investigational product 
is delayed due to medical/safety reasons, dosing must be discus sed with the medical 
monitor prior to administration of investigational product to e nsure that all subjects have 
the same opportunity to receive investigational product; 5) foo tnote ‘j’was added to 
clarify that tetanus vaccine titers will only be tested in the OLP for subjects who tested 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 148 of 214 positive at Day 1 of the RCP; and 6) to add +28 days to AC dete rmination to the Day 1 
visit window for clarification. 
21 Section 4.2.3 (Study Procedures for Assessment Visit): Text was  revised or added for the 
following reasons: 1) to clarify that procedures to determine w hether symptoms are 
related to NMO/NMOSD should be conducted first, followed by pro cedures for 
determination of an NMO/NMOSD attack; 2) to clarify that all as sessments are to be 
documented with time and date and that the order of the assessm ents should be 
determined by the nature of the suspected attack (eg, EDSS befo re Independent 
ophthalmology in the case of myelitis symptoms; 3) to clarify t hat an MRI of all domains 
may be performed as part of the Assessment Visit and can be don e at any time during the 
Assessment Visit, and that the order of the MRI domains can be determined by the 
nature of the suspected attack; 4) to clarify that MRI images/s tudy report should not be 
reviewed by the Principal Investigator unless a specific criter ion for an attack requires 
review of the MRI and in such cases the review of the MRI image  must be done after the 
review of all relevant clinical assessment data is complete; 5)  to clarify that assessments 
should be concluded as soon as possible, but should not extend beyond 4 days from Day 
1 of the Assessment Visit; and 6) to clarify that if the invest igator determines that new or 
worsening symptoms are not related to NMO, then the independent  assessments will not 
be required. 
22 Table 4.2.3-1 (Schedule of Study Procedures for the Assessment Visit): The following 
modifications were made to the table: 1) assessments for proced ures to determine an 
NMO/NMOSD attack were moved below the laboratory assessments an d neuroaxis MRI 
scan was moved to be included in these assessments; 2) a new as sessment was added to 
review data generated against protocol-defined attack criteria and create a narrative of 
the Assessment Visit findings; 3) footnote “b” was revised to c hange the original text to 
“the MRIimage/report is only reviewed by the Principal Investig ator in the event it is 
required by the protocol-defined attack criteria; 4) footnote “ c” was added to clarify that 
if the EDSS and C-SSRS are conducted by the same person that th e EDSS must be 
performed first to eliminate the potential for bias; 3) former footnote “c” was removed to 
avoid confusion; as a full MRI will be performed regardless of the attack criteria.  
23 Section 4.2.4 (Managing Subjects With Worsening Attacks): New s ection was added to 
describe how to manage and capture data from subjects who exper ience worsening of an 
investigator-diagnosed attack. These unscheduled data will prov ide a narrative of the 
subject’s attacks if they worsen after diagnosis. 
24 Section 4.2.5 (Study Procedures for Attack Follow-up Visit): Te xt in this section was 
revised or added for the following reasons: 1) to move text to beginning of the paragraph 
for purpose of highlighing that subjects who experience an NMO/ NMOSD attack 
requiring rescue treatment regardless of the outcome of the AC review will undergo an 
Attack Follow-up Visit; and 2) text was added to clarify the pa tient-reported outcomes 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 149 of 214 should be done first followed by all othr assessments/procedure s in an order to be 
determined by the sites. 
25 Table 4.2.5-1 (Schedule of Study Procedures for the Attack Foll ow-up Visit): The 
following modifications were made to the table: 1) The order of  assessments for SF-36 
Health Survey, C-SSRS, indpendent ophthalmology examination, an d independent 
EDSS/FSS were rearranged; 2) fo otnote “c” was added to clarify that if the EDSS and 
C-SSRS are conducted by the same person that the EDSS must be p erformed first to 
eliminate the potential for bias. 
26 Section 4.2.6 (Safety Follow-up Period): Text was revised to re move reference to the 
order in which study assessments are to be performed as the ord er has no impact on any 
of the assessments in the SFP. 
27 Section 4.3.1.1 (Identification, Assessment, and Adjudication o f an NMO/NMOSD 
Attack), Overview: Text was revised to clarify that following t he start of the Assessment 
Visit, the procedures required to diagnose an NMO/NMOSD attack must be completed 
within a total of 5 days and to add greater clarity that there are 2 main outcomes to the 
Assessment Visit, which are outlined. 
28 Figure 4.3.1.1-1 (Flow Chart of Assessment and Diagnosis of an NMO/NMOSD 
Attack): The flow diagram was updated to better reflect require d process; ie, that an MRI 
is always required at an Assessment Visit; however, review of t he images is criterion 
dependent. 
29 Section 4.3.1.1 (Identification, Assessment, and Adjudication o f an NMO/NMOSD 
Attack), Telephone Calls to Subjects: Text was modified to clar ify that the telephone 
calls made to subjects will be every 2 weeks and not twice a we ek (bi-weekly). 
30 Section 4.3.1.1 (Identification, Assessment, and Adjudication o f an NMO/NMOSD 
Attack), Assessment Visit: Text was revised for the following r easons: 1) to clarify that 
data for the assessment of symptoms that were determined as not  related to 
NMO/NMOSD will be sent to the AC for non-real-time review; 2) t o clarify the the date 
and time of clinical assessments conducted by independent asses sors must be 
documented and the order of the assessments may be driven by th e nature of the 
suspected attack; 3) to clarify that an MRI of all domains shou ld be performed as part of 
an Assessment Visit and can be done at any time during the Asse ssment Visit, and that 
the order of the MRI domains can be determined by the suspected  NMO/NMOSD attack; 
4) to clarify that MRI images/study report should not be review ed by the Principal 
Investigator unless a specific criterion for an attack requires  review of the MRI; 5) to 
clarify that following the independent clinical assessment, the  Principal Investigator 
should decide if any of the clinical criteria have been met and  that the criterion with the 
most significant change should be selected; and 6) if an attack  presents in more than one 
domain, more than one criterion can be selected. These revision s were made to clarify 
that symptom(s) must meet at least one of the objective criteri a for an NMO/NMOSD 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 150 of 214 attack and that the criteria with the most significant clinical  change that the symptoms 
meet should be selected, subsequent criteria with a lesser clin ical change that require 
MRI review should not be considered. However, the symptom(s) ma y meet more than 
one criterion for an NMO/NMOSD attack across a different body s ystem. This is to 
ensure that MRI images and reports are not reviewed when a sign ificant change meets 
criteria 1-8, 12, and 13.  
31 Section 4.3.1.1 (Identification, Assessment, and Adjudication o f an NMO/NMOSD 
Attack), Adjudication Process (For Attacks Occurring During the  RCP): Text was 
revised to clarify that the AC process will completed when the AC makes their final 
decision and that this will occur within a total of 14 days (+ 3 days) from the start of the 
Assessment Visit and that the data set will be provided to the independent AC by the 
vendor. 
32 Table 4.3.1.1-1 (Protocol-defined Criteria for an NMO/NMOSD Att ack): The following 
modifications were made to the table: 1) footnote “c” was remov ed (re: “Symptoms must 
meet at least 1 of the objective criteria for NMO/NMOSD attack” ) because this is 
explained in the text; 2) footnote “e” (newly designated footno te “d”) was modified to 
add “HM to LP or NLP” to 1-step drop in worsening missing from previous version and 
to align with Administrative Change 1; and 3) footnote “f” was added to clarify that 
lesions seen in the optic chiasm also count towards the ON crit eria when evaluating 
Criteria 9, 10, and 11. 
33 Figure 4.3.1.1-2 (Process for Assessing Symptoms Affecting the Eye): The flow diagram 
was updated to better reflect required process; ie, that an MRI  is always required at an 
Assessment Visit; however, review of the images is criterion de pendent. 
34 Figure 4.3.1.1-3 (Process for Assessing Symptoms Affecting the Spinal Cord): The flow 
diagram was updated to better reflect required process; ie, tha t an MRI is always 
required at an Assessment Visit; however, review of the images is criterion dependent. 
35 Figure 4.3.1.1-4 (Process for Assessing Symptoms Affecting the Brain or Brainstem): 
The flow diagram was updated to better reflect required process ; ie, that an MRI is 
always required at an Assessment Visit; however, review of the images is criterion 
dependent. 
36 Section 4.3.1.2 (Neuroaxis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan), MR I for NMO/NMOSD 
Attacks, and Neuroaxis MRI Documentation and Assessment: The te xt in these 
subsections was added or revised for the following reasons: 1) to clarify that a full 
neuroaxis MRI will be performed of all domains in addition to t he scheduled MRI at the 
time of any Assessment Visit and that the MRI scans will be sen t for a central reading 
and data will be collected for analysis at the end of the study ; 2) to clarify the MRI 
images/study report obtained during an Assessment Visit should not be reviewed by the 
Principal Investigator unless required for a specific criterion ; however, should it become 
necessary, review of MRI image and local report must be done af ter the review of all 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 151 of 214 relevant clinical assessment data is complete. As long as the M RIs are not reviewed by 
the Principal Investigator prior to review of the clinical asse ssments no bias will be 
introduced; 3) to clarify that the Principal Investigator shoul d not use these MRIs for any 
clinical decision making; and 4) to clarify that qualification MRI scans may require 
consenting a volunteer subject from the investigative site, dep ending upon local IRB/EC 
requirements. 
37 Section 4.3.1.3 (Ophthalmology Assessments) and Visual Acuity A ssessments: The 
following text in these subsections was added or revised: 1) te xt was added to clarify that 
the ophthalmology examiner is also independent and not otherwis e involved in 
evaluating or examining the subject outside of the protocol to reduce the potential for 
bias; and 2) text referring to light meters was removed as thes e are not required. 
38 Section 4.3.1.4 (Expanded Disability Status Scale and Functiona l System Scores): Text 
was revised to clarify that the EDSS assessment must be conduct ed by a trained and 
certified neurologist who is also independent of the treating p hysician and the subject to 
reduce the potential for bias. 
39 Section 4.3.1.5 (Independent Adjudication Committee): Text was revised following the 
review of the first few attacks that occurred in the study, and  input from the AC 
necessitated clarifications of the AC role and process. This is  outlined in the new text 
and will be reflected also in an amended charter for the AC. Th e committee is 
completely independent and blinded to treatment assignments and /or to pertinent 
treatment unmasking information of study subjects. Clarified th at events not related to 
NMO/NMOSD that occur in the RCP will be sent to the AC for non- real-time 
adjudication.  
40 Section 4.3.3.4 (Electrocardiogram): Text was revised to add EC G recording to Day 1, 
which was missing from previous text. 
41 Section 4.3.4 (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale): Text wa s revised to clarify that 
the Baseline/Screening questionnaire will be used to assess sui cidality in a subject’s 
lifetime and over the 6 months prior to screening. 
42 Section 4.3.6 (Clinical Laboratory Tests): Text was modified or  added for the following 
reasons: 1) hepatitis B surface antibody was added to Other Saf ety Tests for consistency 
with Exclusion Criterion #24; 2) text was added to clarify that  the estimated GFR would 
be calculated and the GFR must be ≥ 60 mL/minute for study elig ibility and for 
consistency with Exclusion Criterion #3. The estimated GFR woul d be calculated by the 
central laboratory based on the plasma and urine creatinine sam ples provided using the 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula; 3) tetanus vacci nation titers was added to 
Other Safety Tests; and 4) subsection for Vaccination Titers wa s added to specify which 
vaccine titers will be analyzed for the samples already specifi ed in the protocol.  
43 Section 4.3.9 (Biomarker Evaluations and Methods): Text was add ed to explain that 
plasma cell gene signature data can be considered potentially u nmasking and that the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 152 of 214 sponsor will not see any potentially unmasking data until after  the study has been 
unmasked for the primary analysis. 
44 Table 4.3.10-1 (Estimate of Blood Volume to Be Collected): The total blood volume for 
Screening was changed from 30 mL to 31 mL to add Ig samples to screening. Total 
blood volume for Day 1 changed from 38 mL to 37 mL to account f or removal of Ig 
samples at Day 1 and to align with Administrative Change 1. 
45 Section 4.5.1.2 (Treatment Administration), Randomized-controll ed Period, and 
Open-label Period: Text in these subsections was revised for th e following reasons: 1) to 
allow some flexibility in the time for subjects completing the RCP without and 
NMO/NMOSD attack to enter the OLP in the events there is a safe ty issue; and 2) to 
clarify that in the event that the second dose of investigation al products is delayed due to 
medical or safety reasons, subsequent dosing must be discussed with the medical 
monitor prior to administration of investigational product. Add itionally, subjects are not 
permitted to enter the OLP after 14 days, unless there is a saf ety reason and the medical 
monitor agrees, in which case a short extension may be granted.   
46 Section 4.5.1.3 (Monitoring of Dose Administration): Text was a dded to state that 
Japanese subjects must receive their RCP Day 1 dose as in-patie nts per local 
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency requirements. 
47 Section 4.5.2.2 (Rescue Medications): Text was revised to clari fy that assessment of new 
symptoms or worsening of exisiting symptoms should be completed  within 5 days to 
determine if an attack has occurred and that the Principal Inve stigator can initiate rescue 
therapy at any time before full assessment is completed and tha t rescue therapy may 
include IV corticosteroids, IVIG, and/or PLEX.  
48 Section 4.5.3 (Dose Adjustments and Missed Doses): Text was sim plified to note that if 
any dose of investigational product is missed, subsequent dosin g and subject 
management must be discussed with the medical monitor prior to any further dosing. 
49 Section 4.6.3 (Methods for Reducing Bias): Text was added or re vised for the following 
reasons: 1) to clarify that the EDSS rater and the ophthalmolog y examiner must remain 
independent of the subject during the study to eliminate the po tential for bias; and 2) to 
clarify that the MRI scans should not be reviewed by the Princi pal Investigator until 
review of the clinical data for the clinical assessments for an  suspected attack type is 
complete. 
50 Section 4.6.4.1 (Unmasking in the Event of a Medical Emergency) : Text was added for 
unmasking in a medical emergency for sites in the Czech Republi c to align with the local 
amendment.  
51 Section 4.6.4.3 (Unmasking due to Known or Hypothesized Effects  of MEDI-551): Text 
was added to inform that data from early phase development in n on-oncology subject 
populations receiving MEDI-551 suggest that MEDI-551 administra tion may be 
associated with potential unspecified mild reduction in total I g in individual subjects and 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 153 of 214 these data will not be made available to investigational sites post randomization through 
the remainder of the study as this reduction may be potentially  unmasking. This addition 
was made to align with Administrative Change 1. Additionally, t ext was added to 
indicate that plasma cell gene signature data and tetanus vacci ne titers are potentially 
unmasking and will not be made available to the sites and plasm a cell gene signature 
samples will not be tested prior to unmasking, and a summary st atement that all 
potentially unmasking data will not be available to the sponsor  prior to unmasking of the 
study at the end of the RCP. 
52 Section 4.7.1.1 (Immunosuppressive Medications During the Scree ning Period): Text 
was revised to clarify that immunosuppressive medications must be stopped prior to 
dosing on Day 1, but steroids must continue according to the pr otocol. 
53 Section 4.7.2 (Prohibited Concomitant Medications): Text was ad ded or revised for the 
following reasons: 1) to clarify that subjects may exit the OLP  at any time for any 
reason, including to seek alternative treatment options as per EMA scientific advice; 2) 
to clarify that low-dose steroids prohibited by the protocol do  not include topical steroids 
because they are not applied at immunosuppressive doses; and 3)  to clarify that there are 
no prohibited medications during the SFP. 
54 Section 4.8.2 (Sample Size and Power Calculations): Text was mo dified to clarify that 
the study is event driven and enrollment of subjects will stop when a total of 67 
AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks occur. The planned number of su bjects to be 
enrolled is 212; however, based on sample size reassessment the  number maybe 
increased to a maximum of 252 subjects. All active randomized s ubjects at the time that 
67 events have occurred will continue in the study to complete the RCP. If eligible, these 
subjects will be able to roll over to the OLP. Therefore, the s ample size will depend on 
achieving this goal and sample size reassessment. 
55 Section 5.2 (Definition of Serious Adverse Events): Text revise d for the following 
reasons: 1) to clarify that for the purposes of this protocol a n SAE of death will include 
NMO/NMOSD disease progression or attack; 2) to clarify that NMO /NMOSD disease 
progression or attacks that meet the SAE criteria, with the exc eption of death, do not 
need to be reported as SAEs in the RCP and OLP since they are s tudy endpoints and to 
further clarify that NMO/NMOSD attacks that meet the SAE criter ia during the 
screening period or SFP will be reported as SAEs as they are no t considered study 
endpoints during these periods and data would otherwise be lost  if not reported; and 3) to 
reinforce that NMO/NMOSD disease progression or attacks that re sult in death will be 
reported as SAEs; and 4) hospitalization for any procedure resu lting from an 
NMO/NMOSD attack will not be reported as an SAE.  
56 Section 8 (References): Reference for Siegrist, 2013 was added to the reference list.

MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 155 of 214 Administrative Change 1; 18Feb2015 
Administrative changes were made primarily for consistency and to correct typographical 
errors. Administrative changes to the protocol are summarized b elow: 
1 Table 4.2.1-1 (Schedule of Screening Procedures): Blood collect ion for total Ig, IgM, 
IgG, IgA, and IgE was added for consistency with Exclusion Crit erion 23a in 
Section 4.1.3 (Exclusion Criteria), which states that subjects with a total Ig level of 
d900 mg/dL at screening are not eligible for the study. 
2 Table 4.2.2.1-1 (Schedule of Randomized-controlled Treatment Pe riod Study 
Procedures): Blood collection for total Ig, IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE was removed at Day 1 
for consistency with Exclusion Criterion 23a in Section 4.1.3 ( Exclusion Criteria), which 
states that subjects with a total Ig level of d900 mg/dL at screening are not eligible for 
the study. 
3 Table 4.3.1.1-1 (Protocol-defined Criteria for an NMO/NMOSD Att ack): Criterion 8 
under ON attack type was corrected to change the word “affected ” to “fellow” for 
consistency with the wording in Criteria 4 and 6 of the same ON  attack type as well as in 
the description of the RAPD assessment in Section 4.3.1.3 (OphthalmologyAssessments). 
4 Table 4.3.1.1-1 (Protocol-defined Criteria for an NMO/NMOSD Att ack: A fourth 
example of a 1-step drop in visual acuity was added to Footnote  “e,” which described a 
change in hand motion (HM) to light perception (LP) or no light  perception (NLP); this 
example was omitted in error. 
5 Table 4.3.10-1 (Estimate of Blood Volume to Be Collected): The estimated volume of 
blood to be collected from each subject at Screening was increa sed 1 mL and the blood 
to be collected from each subject at Day 1 was decreased by the  same amount to account 
for the transition of Ig testing from Day 1 to Screening. 
6 Section 4.6.4.3 (Unmasking due to Known or Hypothesized Effects  of MEDI-551): 
Added that results of Ig testing (total Ig, IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgE) would not be made 
available to investigation sites post randomization through the  remainder of the study. 
 
Protocol Amendment 1; 01Jul2014 
Text revisions resulting from this amendment are incorporated i n the body of Protocol 
Amendment 1. The majority of these changes were made in respons e to feedback from the US 
FDA Special Protocol Assessment requested by MedImmune. Major c hanges to the protocol 
are summarized below. 
1 Study Abstract: Updated to be consistent with the changes made to the body of the 
protocol. 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 156 of 214 2 Section 1.1 (Disease Background) and Section 1.5 (Rationale for  Study): Simplified the 
description of NMO and its associated characteristics for clari ty. 
3 Section 1.6.2 (Secondary Hypotheses): The following changes wer e made: 1) Added 
MRI lesion hypothesis; and 2) Removed secondary hypotheses pert aining to safety and 
PK to simplify the section and focus it on the efficacy outcome s. 
4 Section 2.1.1 (Primary Objective) and Section 1.6.1 (Primary Hy pothesis): Revised the 
subject population for the primary analysis to include both AQP 4-IgG seropositive and 
seronegative subjects. 
5 Section 2.1.2 (Secondary Objectives): Added secondary objective  comparing the 
efficacy of MEDI-551 versus placebo in reducing the cumulative active MRI lesion 
count (new Gd-enhancing or new/enlarging T2). This study aims t o collect longitudinal 
MRI data during both study periods, including at the time of an  attack, to investigate the 
characteristics and evolution of spinal and brain lesions in NM O/NMOSD. 
6 Section 2.1.3 (Exploratory Objectives): Added exploratory objec tive comparing the 
effect of MEDI-551 versus placebo on pain as measured using the  pain NRS. A number 
of recent publications have indicated that patients with NMO/NM OSD experience pain 
throughout the course of their disease. Pain in demyelinating a nd inflammatory CNS 
diseases can be disabling and may contribute to a lower quality  of life and overall 
increased health care burden.  
7 Section 2.2.1 (Primary Endpoint): The following changes were ma de: 1) Revised the 
timeframe of the primary endpoint definition from Day 183 to Da y 197 to coincide with 
the increased length of the RCP, which will be extended by 2 we eks to account for the 
2-week oral corticosteroid use between Day 1 and Day 14; 2) Rem oved the restriction 
that the primary analysis will be based on AQP4-IgG seropositiv e subjects. The primary 
analysis will first be tested in AQP4-IgG seropositive subjects , and if statistically 
significant, it will be further tested in all subjects; and 3) Removed Table 2.2.1-1 from 
this section and moved it to Section 4.3.1.1 (Identification, A ssessment, and 
Adjudication of an NMO/NMOSD Attack).  
8 Section 2.2.2 (Secondary Endpoints): The following changes were  made: 1) Revised the 
visual acuity endpoint to change the measurement tool from the Sloan Letters Low 
Contrast Chart to the Landolt C Broken Rings Chart as recommend ed by MedImmune’s 
NMO Steering Committee; 2) Added an MRI lesion endpoint to coin cide with the 
addition of a secondary objective; and 3) Revised the definitio n of in-patient 
hospitalization from hospital stay greater than 24 hours to mor e than an overnight stay. 
9 Section 2.2.3 (Exploratory Endpoint[s]): The following changes were made: 1) Added an 
endpoint for the pain NRS objective; and 2) Removed the biomark er exploratory 
endpoint (this endpoint will be analyzed as part of an explorat ory investigation. 
10 Section 3.1.1 (Overview): The following changes were made: 1) C hanged the sample 
size of the study from 252 to 212 subjects due to the addition of the AQP4-IgG 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 157 of 214 seronegative subjects as part of the primary endpoints, with th e potential to increase the 
number of subjects to 252 if the sample size needs to be reasse ssed; 2) Extended the 
RCP to 197 days to account for the 2-week oral corticosteroid u se between Day 1 and 
Day 14; 3) Revised text for the enrollment of subjects into the  OLP and continuation of 
subjects in the RCP if an NMO/NMOSD attack was not determined b y the AC based on 
comments received from the Agency regarding the identification,  assessment, and 
adjudication of NMO/NMOSD attacks; 4) Revised the time period f or the OLP to add a 
maximum time length of 3 years (after the last subject enters) if regulatory approval or 
MEDI-551 development is halted after 3 years; 5) Renamed the Lo ng-term Follow-up 
Period the SFP to evaluate the long-term safety of the investig ational product; 6) Added 
subsections 3.1.1.1 (Screening Period), 3.1.1.2 (Randomization [Day 1]), 3.1.1.3 
(Randomized-controlled Period [Day 1 to Day 197]), 3.1.1.4 (Ope n-label Period), and 
3.1.1.5 (Safety Follow-up Period) to clarify existing text (Sec tions 3.1.1.1 and 3.1.1.2) 
and to summarize changes made to the design of the study based on the Agency’s 
comments to better define the identification, assessment, and a djudication of 
NMO/NMOSD attacks and the process of enrolling subjects into th e OLP 
(Sections 3.1.1.3, 3.1.1.4, and 3.1.1.5); 7) Replaced previous Figure 3.1.1-1 (Study Flow 
Diagram) with new figure. 
11 Section 3.1.2 (Treatment Regimen): The following changes were m ade: 1) Clarified that 
equivalent antihistamines to diphenhydramine can be used as par t of the MEDI-551 
premedication regimen; 2) Changed the 2-week tapering reduction  schedule to 1 week; 
and 3) Clarified the text for dosing of subjects in the OLP. 
12 Section 3.2.1 (Study Design Rationale): Revised the study desig n rationale for clarity 
and for changes made to previous sections of the protocol. 
13 Section 3.2.2 (Dose Rationale): Revised the dose rationale for clarity. 
14 Section 3.2.3 (Rationale for Study Population): Revised the rat ionale for study 
population for clarity, to reflect changes in study design, and  to add supporting 
information. 
15 Section 3.2.4 (Rationale for Endpoints): The following changes were made: 1) Revised 
the rationale for the primary, secondary, and exploratory endpo ints for clarity and for 
consistency with changes made in Sections 2.2.1 (Primary Endpoi nt), 2.2.2 (Secondary 
Endpoints), and 2.2.3 (Exploratory Endpoint[s]); and 2) Added S ection 3.2.4.4 
(Exploratory Investigations) to summarize the rationale for the  biomarker endpoint 
(previously an exploratory endpoint) and added a rationale for investigating T-cell 
responses since there is increasing evidence for the involvemen t of effector T cells in the 
pathogenesis of NMO. 
16 Section 3.2.4.1 (Primary Endpoint): The following changes were made: 1) Revised text 
for primary endpoint to onset of an AC-determined NMO/NMOSD att ack on or before 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 158 of 214 Day 197; 2) Revised text to support limiting subject exposure t o placebo by utilizing 
time to attack as the primary endpoint.  
17 Section 3.2.4.2 (Secondary Endpoints): The following changes we re made: 1) Changed 
low contrast visual acuity charts from Sloan Letters Chart to L andolt C Broken Rings 
Chart; 2) Added MRI-related endpoint rationale and supporting i nformation for 
collecting longitudinal MRI data during both study periods and at time of attack to 
investigate the characteristics and evolution of spinal and bra in lesions in 
NMO/NMOSD; 3) Redefined in-patient hospitalization for the purp oses of analysis of 
the secondary endpoint and added supporting information.  
18 Section 4.1.1 (Number of Subjects): Clarified the number of sub jects planned for the 
study based on both AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative subj ects and the addition 
of subjects for the purposes of reassessing the sample size bas ed on the NMO/NMOSD 
attack rate. 
19 Section 4.1.2 (Inclusion Criteria): The following changes were made: 1) Added to 
Inclusion Criterion 3b, data from AQP4-IgG seronegative subject s will be reviewed by 
an independent expert to confirm eligibility; 2) Added to Inclu sion Criterion 7 that 
female partners who are unable to comply with any required cont raception method (such 
as male condom plus spermicide) must use one of the other recom mended highly 
effective contraceptive methods; 3) Changed Inclusion Criterion  7 to state that 
nonsterilized males must use contraception from Day 1 for 3 mon ths if they are sexually 
active with a female partner of childbearing potential; and 4) Added Criterion 8, 
sterilized males, with the appropriate post-vasectomy documenta tion on the absence of 
sperm in the ejaculate, who are sexually active with a female p artner of childbearing 
potential, must use a highly effective method of contraception from Day 1 for 3 months 
after receipt of the final dose of investigational product. Cri terion was added to 
accommodate contraception requirements in the United Kingdom.  
20 Section 4.1.3 (Exclusion Criteria): The following changes were made: 1) Clarified 
Exclusion Criterion 11 to state prior to randomization; 2) Revi sed Exclusion Criterion 12 
to state prior to randomization rather than at the time of scre ening; and 3) Added 
Exclusion Criterion 13 excluding subjects who received IVIG wit hin 1 month prior to 
randomization as it might affect subject outcomes. 
21 Section 4.1.4 (Subject Enrollment and Randomization): Added sub section headers 
(Sections 4.1.4.1 [Enrollment] and 4.1.4.2 [Randomization Proce ss]) for clarity and 
revised the subsection on Informed Consent Requirements for cla rity. 
22 Section 4.1.5 (Withdrawal from the Study): Added instructions f or subjects who want to 
discontinue participation in the study during the RCP to consid er following 
protocol-specified assessments until Day 197 and for subjects w ho want to discontinue 
the study during the OLP to enter the SFP in order to capture m ore data on these 
subjects. 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 159 of 214 23 Section 4.1.7 (Replacement of Subjects): The following changes were made: 1) Changed 
adjudicated to AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks; and 2) Removed reference to 
AQP4-IgG serostatus.  
24 Section 4.2.1 (Enrollment/Screening Period): The following chan ges were made: 
1) Added that any subject who has an AQP4-IgG seronegative stat us at screening will 
have their medical history and MRI data reviewed by an independ ent NMO expert to 
ensure that the subject meets the Wingerchuk et al, 2006  diagnostic criteria for NMO; 
2) Removed language regarding the definition of NMO/NMOSD relap se as the 
identification, assessment, and adjudication processes have bee n updated per comments 
made by the Agency; 3) Added assessment of JCV antibody titers at screening; 4) 
Clarified that whole blood for flow cytometry includes B-cell c ount and cell subsets; 
5) Clarified that serum for AQP4-IgG includes serostatus and ti ter assessments; and 
6) Changed APD assessment to RAPD assessment for the ophthalmol ogy examination. 
25 Section 4.2.2.1 (Randomized-controlled Treatment Period): The f ollowing changes were 
made: 1) Extended the RCP to Day 197 due to the 2-week oral cor ticosteroid use 
between Day 1 and Day 14; this resulted in changing the Day 141  visit to Day 155; 2) 
Added that subjects should continue in the SFP if they undergo the EDV to follow 
subjects for safety. 
26 Table 4.2.2.1-1 (Schedule of Randomized-controlled Treatment Pe riod Study 
Procedures): The following changes were made: 1) Changed Study Weeks 20 (Day 141) 
and 26/EDV (Day 183) to Study Weeks 22 (Day 155) and 28/EDV (Da y 197); 2) 
Changed Pain scale to Pain NRS and deleted assessment at Day 15 ; 3) Added sample for

added as an exploratory analysis at Days 1, 85, and 197/EDV; 4)  Removed 
ophthalmology examinations for visual fields, OCT, and fundosco py; and 5) Added mRS 
to assessments.  
27 Section 4.2.2.2 (Open-label Period): The following changes were  made: 1) Revised text 
to clarify that subjects completing Day 197 of the RCP, Day 1 o f the OLP should be the 
same day, but may be delayed up to 14 days without repeating pr ocedures; subjects will 
not be permitted to enter the OLP after 14 days. The 14 days wi ndow was added to give 
the subject reasonable time to make the decision to enter the O LP without putting the 
subject at potential increased risk for an attack as he/she wil l not be treated until entering 
the OLP or deciding to discontinue from the study and getting a nother treatment; 2) 
Added that subjects who have an AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack during the RCP 
must enter the OLP within 14 days of AC determination. If more than 14 days elapse 
since the Assessment Visit, Day 1 procedures should be repeated ; 3) Added that MEDI-
551 will be administered on OLP Day 1; 4) Revised OLP duration as a minimum of 1 
year after the last subject enters and a maximum of 3 years aft er the last subject enters;

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 160 of 214 Changed Day 183+/EDV to Day 197+/EDV for procedures to be condu cted for subjects 
who withdraw during a scheduled study visit. 
28 Table 4.2.2.2-1 (Schedule of Open-label Period Study Procedures ): The following 
changes were made: 1) Added +14 days from Day 197 of the RCP or  AC determination 
to visit window for Day 1 of the OLP; 2) Changed every 12 weeks  (Q12W; Day 85) to

(Q26W; Day 274+), changed Q26W/EDV to Week 52, then Q26W/EDV (D ay 365+); 3) 
Added written informed consent to procedures as subjects will r equire reconsent to enter 
the OLP; 4) Changed Pain scale to Pain NRS; 5) Removed ophthalm ology examinations 
for visual fields, OCT, and fundoscopy; 6) Added footnotes for procedures to be 
conducted for clarification. 
29 Section 4.2.3 (Study Procedures for Assessment Visits): The fol lowing changes were 
made: 1) Changed Attack Visit to Assessment Visit; 2) Revised t hat Assessment Visit 
should be scheduled as soon as possible and within 72 hours of symptom report; 3)

were made: 1) Changed Long-term Follow-up Period to SFP; 2) Add ed that the SFP will 
start when a subject discontinues early from the RCP or the OLP , and the length of the 
SFP will be determined by the time elapsed from time of last do se of investigational 
product to time of early discontinuation to complete a total of  52 weeks; subjects who 
discontinue during the RCP will continue with study assessments  until Day 197, unless 
consent is withdrawn; 3) Revised that the SFP will last 52 week s from the last dose of 
study drug. The SFP is introduced to follow subjects who premat urely discontinue from 
the study for safety only as it is not reasonable to request su bjects who do not wish to 
continue in the study to continue with the study procedures.  
32 Table 4.2.5-1 (formerly Table 4.2.4-1, Schedule of Procedures f or Safety Follow-up 
Period): The following changes were made: 1) Changed Long-term Follow-up Period to 
SFP; 2) Removed assessments for assessing new and/or worsening NMO/NMOSD

investigator; 4) Added subsection, Detailed Procedures, for ide ntifying new or 
worsening symptoms that may be related to an NMO/NMOSD attack; 5) Updated 
Table 4.3.1.1-1 (Protocol-defined Criteria for an NMO/NMOSD Att ack) and moved to 
this section from Section 2.2.1; 6) Added 3 flow diagrams for a ssessing symptoms 
affecting the eye, spinal cord, and brain or brainstem; 7) Dele ted Figure 4.3.1.1-2 
(NMO/NMOSD Attack Flow Diagram) as this was replaced by updated  Figure 3.1.1-1 
(Study Flow Diagram); 8) Added Figures 4.3.1.1-2, 4.3.1.1-3, an d 4.4.1.1-4.

visits, follow-up visit by the site, during bi-weekly telephone  calls, or from spontaneous 
reporting by the subject; 3) Added that a standardized workshee t will be used by the sites 
to elicit consistent information; 4) Revised that information t o be recorded includes date 
of contact, if symptom(s) was not related to NMO/NMOSD but to a n AE, and date of 
scheduled Assessment Visit. 
35 Section 4.3.1.1 (formerly Section 4.3.1.3), Telephone Calls to Subjects Every 2 Weeks: 
The following changes were made: 1) Added section to define pro cess for telephone 
contact with subjects and study periods and durations; 2) Added  that calls will follow a 
pre-specified script; 3) Added that if the investigator suspect s an NMO/NMOSD attack 
or impending attack, an Assessment Visit must be scheduled with in 72 hours. These 
changes were made to clarify the telephone call process.  
36 Section 4.3.1.2 (formerly Section 4.3.1.4, Neuroaxis Magnetic R esonance Imaging

Network symposium. J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2006;1175(3):391-7. 
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and F ood Allergy and Anaphylaxis 
Network define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause 
death. They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteri a designated to capture from 
80% of cases (category 1) to > 95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for all 3 categories).   
1 Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with invol vement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flu shing, swollen lips-tongue-
uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING 
(a) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, strid or, reduced peak 
expiratory flow [PEF], hypoxemia) 
(b) Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg,  hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2 Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours): 
(a) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) 
(b) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, strid or, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia) 
(c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], sy ncope, 
incontinence) 
(d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain , vomiting) 
3 Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (m inutes to several hours): 
(a) Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater  than 30% decrease in 
systolic BP 
(b) Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% d ecrease from that 
person’s baseline

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 171 of 214 Appendix 3  Additional Safety Guidance 
Assessment of Severity 
Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the in vestigator in the evaluation of 
AEs and SAEs. The determination of severity should be made by t he investigator based upon 
medical judgment and the severity categories of Grade 1 to 5 as  defined below. 
Grade 1 (mild) An event that is usually transient and may requi re only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not gener ally 
interfere with usual activities of daily living. 
Grade 2 (moderate) An event that is usually alleviated with add itional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activ ities of 
daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. 
Grade 3 (severe) An event that requires intensive therapeutic i ntervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly a ffects the 
clinical status of the subject. 
Grade 4 (life threatening) An event, and/or its immediate seque lae, that is associated with an 
imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that 
affect or limit the ability of the subject to perform activitie s of daily 
living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc). 
Grade 5 (fatal) Death (loss of life) as a result of an event. 
 
It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and sev erity of an AE. Severity is a 
measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the crit eria in Section 5.2. A Grade 3 
AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE. For example, a Gr ade 3 headache that persists 
for several hours may not meet the regulatory definition of an SAE and would be considered a 
nonserious event, whereas a Grade 2 seizure resulting in a hosp ital admission would be 
considered an SAE. 
Abnormal laboratory results may be graded according to NCI Comm on Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events V4.0 ( NCI, 2009 ).  
Assessment of Relationship 
Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator is required to provide an assessment of relati onship of AEs and SAEs to the 
investigational product. 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 172 of 214 An event will be considered “not related” to use of the investi gational product if any of the 
following tests are met: 
x An unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of  the investigational 
product and the onset of the event (eg, the event occurred eith er before, or too long after, 
administration of the investigational product for it to be cons idered product-related) 
x A causal relationship between the investigational product and t he event is biologically 
implausible (eg, death as a passenger in an automobile accident ) 
x A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the event is present (eg, typical adverse 
reaction to a concomitant drug and/or typical disease-related e vent) 
 
Individual AE/SAE reports will be considered “related” to use o f the investigational product if 
the “not related” criteria are not met.  
“Related” implies that the event is considered to be “associate d with the use of the drug” 
meaning that there is “a reasonable possibility” that the event  may have been caused by the 
product under investigation (ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible 
causation). 
Relationship to Protocol Procedures 
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of r elationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreatment-e mergent SAEs (ie, SAEs 
that occur prior to the administration of investigational produ ct) as well as treatment-emergent 
SAEs. A protocol-related SAE may occur as a result of a procedu re or intervention required 
during the study (eg, blood collection, washout of an existing medication). The following 
guidelines should be used by investigators to assess the relati onship of SAEs to the protocol: 
Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure/interve ntion that was described in the 
protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the subject’s medical record. 
Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other  than the procedure/ intervention 
that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology mu st be documented in the study 
subject’s medical record).

The proposed study is being planned to detect a target relative  reduction of 60% in risk for 
time (days) from Day 1 to onset of an AC-determined NMO/NMOSD a ttack on or before 
Day 197 with 90% power and D = 0.05 (two-sided), assuming an unequal randomization ratio 
of 3:1 to MEDI-551 versus placebo. Using the following formula,  a total of 67 AC-determined 
NMO/NMOSD attacks will be required:

Since the primary endpoint will be tested using the Cox proport ional model, a simulation 
approach was used to investigate the power under alternative hy potheses mentioned above. 
Based on 5,000 simulations, the power for the overall and serop ositive populations were 
observed as 94% and 91%, respectively. Moreover, the total requ ired 67 events (212 subjects) 
were, on an average, distributed in seropostive and seronegativ e cohorts as 57 (168 subjects) 
and 10 (44 subjects) respectively. 
The underlying hazard rate of time to an NMO/NMOSD attack in th e seropositive placebo 
group is estimated based on a meta-analytic approach from sever al open-label cohort studies 
(see Table 17) in the absence of any placebo-controlled study i n this population to date. These

applied for seropositive subgroup in the current study. Followi ng are the 5 open-label studies

The approximate time (months) between the first 2 pretreatment relapses was visually 
enumerated from the published figures for each study (Figure 7,  Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10, 
and Figure 11). Subjects with second pretreatment relapses occu rring within 12 months of the 
first relapse were considered failures. Hazard rate (assuming e xponential distribution) was 
calculated from each study based on this failure rate. Overall hazard rate for time to second 
pretreatment relapse was calculated based on the weighted avera ge of individual hazard rates 
(weight was based on number of failures from each study). The f indings from this analysis are 
summarized in Table 18.

The weighted average of the hazard rates was determined as 1.33 /year. As none of the cohorts 
in these studies received pure  placebo treatment, the hazard ra te for the place bo treatment for 
the seropositive subgroup in the current study is estimated to be 1.5/year. Conservatively, the 
hazard rate for the placebo treatment in seronegative subgroup is chosen as 1.0/year.

treatment ( Bedi et al, 2011 , Jacob et al, 2008 , and Kim et al, Nov 2011 ). For each of these 
studies, the subjects who were re lapse free within the first 12  months of respective treatment 
were visually identified (Tab le 19). Based on the survival rate  thus obtained, the yearly 
constant hazard rate was calcula ted and the weighted average wa s determined.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 209 of 214 Appendix 10  Details of Futility Analysis 
An unmasked interim analysis will be conducted for futility ass essment by the DMC when 
approximately 50% of the total planned AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attacks occur in this 
study. This will be triggered when approximately 34 AC-determin ed NMO/NMOSD attacks 
occur in the ITT population. The assessment of futility will be  based on predictive power, 
which is based on the average conditional power calculated at t he observed treatment effect at 
the time of the interim analysis. The study will be considered futile if the predictive power is 
< 20% in both the ITT population and the AQP4-IgG seropositive cohort. Figure 12 provides 
estimated predictive power when observed treatment effect varie s from 0 to 90% in relative 
reduction in risk of an AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack in the I TT population. The 20% 
predictive power translates into a treatment effect of approxim ately 27%. A value of 50% and 
90% predictive power will result in 43% and 60% treatment effec ts, respectively, which are 
minimally detectable treatment effect and target treatment effe ct for this study. The actual 
predictive power will be calculated based on observed data.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 210 of 214 Appendix 11  Type I Error Control 
To establish Type I error control, the primary endpoint, and th e 4 secondary endpoints will be 
denoted by E1 through E5, respectively, as follows: 
x E1: Time to AC-determined NMO/NMOSD attack 
x E2: Worsening from baseline in EDSS at last visit during the RC P 
x E3: Change from baseline in low-contrast visual acuity binocula r score measured by low-
contrast Landolt C Broken Rings Chart, at last visit during RCP  
x E4: Cumulative total active MRI lesions (new Gd-enhancing or ne w/enlarging T2) during 
the RCP 
x E5: Number of NMO/NMOSD-related in-patient hospitalizations 
 
Based on 2 populations of interest (seropositive and ITT popula tions), this will result in 
testing 10 null hypotheses of no treatment effect labeled as fo llows (Table 21): 
Table 21 List of Null Hypotheses Considered Under Multiplicity Adjustment 
Procedure 
Hypothesis Test 
S1 Test E1 in seropositive subjects 
S2 Test E2 in seropositive subjects 
S3 Test E3 in seropositive subjects 
S4 Test E4 in seropositive subjects 
S5 Test E5 in seropositive subjects 
O1 Test E1 in ITT population 
O2 Test E2 in ITT population 
O3 Test E3 in ITT population 
O4 Test E4 in ITT population 
O5 Test E5 in ITT population 
 The multiplicity adjustment strategy based on Bonferroni-based chain procedure 
(Bretz et al, 2009 ; Millen and Dmitrienko, 2011 ) for testing these 10 hypotheses is defined in 
Figure 13. Each hypothesis is represented by a rectangular box.  The connections among the 
hypotheses are visualized using arrows. A solid arrow is used t o define the decision path after 
a hypothesis is rejected, eg, the hypothesis O1 is tested if an d only if the hypothesis S1 is 
rejected. The Bonferroni-based chain procedures are characteriz ed by 2 rules: 
x The alpha allocation rule specifies the initial distribution of  the Type I error rate among 
the null hypotheses according to the relative importance of the  null hypotheses 
x The alpha propagation rule determines the process of re-distrib uting the available Type I 
error rate among the non-rejected null hypotheses after each re jection

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 211 of 214  
Figure 13 Multiplicity Adjustment Strategy 
 
 
The alpha allocation rule is sp ecified in Table 22. Specificall y, the null hypothesis S1 receives 
the initial weight of 1 (ie, it is tested at the full D = 0.05) and the other null hypotheses receive 
zero weights. The alpha propaga tion rule is specified in Table 23. The alpha propagation rules 
are defined using transition para meters, eg, the first row in T able 23 shows that the fraction of 
the Type I error rate used in testing the null hypothesis S1 wi ll be transferred to the null 
hypothesis O1 if the null hypothesis S1 is rejected. Similarly,  if the null hypothesis O1 is 
rejected, the available Type I e rror rate will be split equally  among the null hypotheses S2, S3, 
S4, and S5 (a quarter  of the available Type  I error rate will b e allocated to each null 
hypothesis). The alpha allocati on and alpha propag ation rule un iquely define the Bonferroni-
based chain procedure and the associated multiplicity-adjusted p-values can be computed 
using Algorithm 2 given in Bretz et al (2009) .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 213 of 214 Appendix 12  Assessment and Collection of Adverse Events 
If an investigator learns of any SAEs, including death, at any time after a subject has 
completed the study and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is 
related to MEDI-551, the investigator should notify the Sponsor .  
Variables to be Collected for AEs and SAEs 
AEs 
The following variables will be collected for each AE: 
x AE (verbatim) 
x Date when the AE started and stopped 
x Whether the AE is serious 
x Investigator causality rating against the investigational produ ct (yes or no) 
x Action taken with regard to investigational product 
x If AE caused the subject to be withdrawn from the study (yes or  no) 
x Outcome 
 
SAEs 
For SAEs, other variables will be collected, including treatmen t given for the event. 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity, whereas, seriousness is defined by the criteria pres ented in Section 5.2. An AE of 
severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. Fo r example, nausea that persists 
for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an S AE. On the other hand, a 
stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke, but it 
would become an SAE when it satisfies the criteria.  
Causality 
The investigator will assess the causal relationship between th e investigational product and 
each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question, ‘Do you cons ider there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the investig ational product?’ 
For SAEs, the causal relationship will also be assessed for oth er medication and study 
procedures. For SAEs that could be associated with any study pr ocedure, the causal 
relationship is implied as ‘yes.’  
AEs Based on Signs and Symptoms 
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject or care provider,  or reported in response to the 
question, ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?’, or 
MedImmune Protocol CD-IA-M EDI-551-1155 Amendment 6 
MEDI-551 11Oct2018; Final 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRI ETARY 214 of 214 any AEs that were observed, will be collected and recorded in t he eCRF. When collecting 
AEs, recording the diagnosis is preferred to a listing of signs  and symptoms. However, if a 
diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that a re not generally considered 
part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom s hould be recorded separately. 
AEs Based on Examinations and Tests 
The results of protocol-mandated laboratory tests and vital sig ns will be summarized in the 
clinical study report. Deterioration in protocol-mandated labor atory test values or vital signs 
compared to baseline should only be reported as AEs if they ful fill any of the SAE criteria, or 
are a reason for the discontinuation of treatment with the inve stigational product. 
If deterioration in a laboratory test value or vital sign is as sociated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the clinical sign or symptom should be reported as an  AE and the associated 
laboratory test result or vital sign will be considered additio nal information. Wherever 
possible, the reporting investigator should use the clinical te rm rather than the laboratory term 
(eg, “anemia” versus “low hemoglobin value”). In the absence of  clinical signs or symptoms, 
clinically-relevant deteriorations in nonmandated parameters sh ould be reported as AE(s). 
Any new or aggravated clinically-relevant abnormal medical find ing at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an  AE (baseline data are 
collected at Visit 2).

INTRODUCTION 
Mucus secretion and clearance is the primary physical defence of the airway epithelium.1 Although mucus plays 
a defensive role, secretion  retention is a common but serious problem in patients with chronic lung disease such 
as cystic fibrosis (CF).3  Poor ion transport and rapid respiratory rate are thought to play a role in secretion 
hypohydration in the CF airway and this is thought to contribute to poor mucus clearance, increasing pulmonary symptoms (pulmonary exacerbation), poor sleep quality and a reduction in  quality of life  (QoL).
4 We h ave 
recently shown that  high- flow,  heated and humidified air delivered by a nasal cannula (HHNC) improves 
mucociliary  clearance and clinical outcomes in young children requiring chronic mechanical ventilation.5 To date, 
nocturnal HHNC (without supplemental  oxygen) therapy has not been studied in individuals diagnosed with CF 
but previous laboratory research suggests that this could be safe and beneficial .6  
Revised 25May2016 Version 4. 1                Page 2 of 10  
HYPOTHESIS  
It is hypothesized that HHNC delivered at  20 liters  per minute (LPM)  via Optiflow™ cannula and AIRVO™2 
device may favorably affect the physical properties of the sputum and improve the subject’s  ability to clear 
secretions , resulting in beneficial clinical effects and improved quality of life.  
 
STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
Primary Objectives  
• To evaluate the effectiveness of 20 LPM HHNC  therapy (Optiflow™ cannula and AIRVO™2 device)  – 
experimental therapy versus 5 LPM  HHNC  therapy ( Optiflow™ cannula and AIRVO™2 device) – control 
therapy  on physiological outcomes in hospitalized subjects with cystic fibrosis during an acute 
exacerbation .   
 
Secondary Objectives  
 
• To determine if the experimental therapy has an effect  on Quality of Life as measured by  the Cystic 
Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ -R) comp ared to control therapy 
• To determine the effect of the experimental therapy on sleep duration using actigraphy (Actiwatch® 2) 
and subjective sleep quality  measured by the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) compared to 
control therapy 
• To determine the effect of the experimental therapy on Quality of Life  in respect  to nasal dysfunction as 
measured by the Sino- Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT -20) compared to control therapy 
• To determine the effect of the experimental therapy on comfort and ease of use using the non- validated 
comfort survey (VAS score) compared to control therapy  
Primary Endpoints  
• Change in sputum volume, cough transportability and hydration (% solids) 
• Change in FEV 1 % predicted from admission to end of study.  
STUDY DESIGN 
The study is a single -center, randomized pilot study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness 20 LPM HHNC  
(Optiflow™ cannula and AIRVO™2 device)  experimental therapy, versus 5 LPM  HHNC (Optiflow™ cannula 
and AIRVO™2 device) control therapy, on specified  outcome s in hospitalized subjects with cystic fibrosis during 
acute exacerbation.   
Potential subjects  will be identified in clinic before admission to the Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU 
(CHoR)  or Virginia Commonwealth University Medical. If potential subj ects are not identified in clinic, they will 
be introduced to and informed of the study by a member of the study team within 24 hours of hospital admission.   
Assent from a subject will be obtained if they are aged  10 to 17 years  along with informed consent from the 
eligible  subject’s parent or legal guardian . Informed consent will be obtained from subjects aged 18 years or older. 
All informed consent/assent discussions will take place in a private room and be documented according to the 
Pediatric Research Office’s ‘Informed Consent Process Cover Sheet’. Potential subjects and family members will 
be given as much time as necessary  to determine if they would like to participate in the study. No study team 
member will be present during this period to minimize any possible coercion.  
Revised 25May2016 Version 4. 1                Page 3 of 10 After informed consent is obtained the subject will be assigned a unique ‘Subject Identification Number.’  This 
number will consist of ‘VCUFP##’, where the first subject  will be ‘VCUFP01’, the second ‘VCUFP02’, and so 
forth.  This unique identifier  will be used instead of the subject ’s name, birth date, etc., to identify the subject for 
all study records and data.   
After Subject Identification Number assignment is performed, randomization will occur. The study team will use 
the website www.randomization.com  to randomize 30 study conditions (15 experimental and 15 control). The 
Study Coordinator will follow the randomization table chronologically as new subje cts are consented.  
This study is designed to accommodate 30 subjects (15 subjects per group) (Table 1) . The  study population will 
be determined from previously diagnosed CF patients  who receive their CF care at CHoR and Virginia 
Commonwealth University. Subjects will be  aged 10 years and older who are experiencing a CF exacerbation 
that requires  hospital admission and therapy.

If a subject requests to withdraw from the study at any point, they are asked to inform the study doctor.  
Withdrawal from the study will not affect standard treatment the subject will receive for their CF exacerbation or 
ongoing treatment they may require. Upon withdrawal, the subject will forfeit any compensation for study participation.  
Study subjects may be involuntarily removed from the study if the study doctor believes that they are not complying with the study protocol and/or the study doctor believes it is in the best interest of the subject to stop participation.   
Study devices/equipment  
The experimental therapy will be administered using Optiflow™ nasal cannula with the AIRVO™2 humidifier.  
The AIRVO™2 device will heat and humidify ambient air and the Optiflow™ nasal cannula  will deliver the 
heated  (approximately 34°C) and humidified air via the nares  at a flow  of 20 LPM . 
Fisher & Paykel Healthcare manufactures  the Optiflow™ nasal cannula and the AIRVO™2 device. The 
Optiflow™ nasal cannula  and AIRVO™2  device are being provided by Fisher & Paykel Healthcare for the study 
with no cost to the study subject. In addition, the subject will not be subjected to any further costs associated with 
the study. The study devices  will only be able available for use by the subjects that are enrolled in the study. The 
subject will be required  to return the study device  at the conclusion of the subject’s study involvement, or when 
the subject is discharged from the hospital (whichever occurs first).  
The control therapy will be administered using Optiflow™ nasal cannula with the AIRVO™2 device.  The nasal 
cannula will deliver heated  (approximately 34°C) and humidified air into the subject’s nares  at a flow of 5 LPM. 
This aims to mask the experimental and control therapy from the subjects and investigators. 
Revised 25May2016 Version 4. 1                Page 4 of 10 Subjects will be educated by the study coordinator on how the device works and how to set up the nasal cannula 
appropriately. Subjects will be instructed to sleep with the designated nasal cannula and device as instructed 
during their hospitalization, for a maximum of five nights . The time the device is placed in the subject’s n ares 
and the time when the device is turned on will be recorded regardless of the intervention group to which the 
subject is assigned .  The nursing staff will be instructed to check that the individual is wea ring the device (either 
experimental or control) appropriately throughout the entire night. Should the nursing staff notice the nasal 
cannula being worn incorrectly the nurse will attempt to correctly reposition without disturbing the subject or if 
this is  not successful the subject will be awakened  to ensure correct  cannula placement . Following the overnight 
intervention, the nasal cannula will be removed from the device and washed with warm water and mild dish 
washing detergent. After rinsing  with clean w ater the nasal cannula will be stored in a clean zip locked bag taped 
to the device during periods of non-use.  
At study conclusion for each subject (Table 2. Study Procedures), the device will be cleaned and sanitized per 
manufacturer’s guidelines. Whil e not in use, the devices will remain clean/sanitized and stored appropriately 
within in the hospital facility .

Revised 25May2016 Version 4. 1                Page 7 of 10 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
Power Calculation 
No studies have evaluated the effect of high-flow HHNC  therapy to improve sinopulmonary symptoms in CF. 
Thus, the current study is designed as a pilot study that is likely to be underpowered to reach significance.  
Electronic Database Capture  
Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is a secure 
web application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing user -friendly web -based case 
report forms, real -time data entry validation (e.g. for data types and range checks), audit trails and a de -identified 
data export mechanism to common statistical packages (JMP, SAS). REDCap also includes a powerful tool for building and managing online surveys. The database is hosted by VCU under award number UL1RR031990 from the National Center for Research Resources and NIH Roadmap for Medical Research, National Institutes of Health.  
Only the study coordinators and the research assistant s will have access to this password protected database.   
With the exception of  the ‘Informed Consent /Assent ’ page s in the REDCap database, all subsequent pages will 
only identify the subject by the Subject Identification Number.   
All hard copies of the signed Informed Consent /Assent  documents will be kept in locked cabinet which is located 
in the study coordinator’s locked office.  A copy of the signed Informed Consent/Assent will be scanned into the 
subject’s electronic medical record.  Any  other paper records that may be  generated during the course of the study 
will be de -identified and labeled with the individuals Subject Identification Number and kept separated from the 
consent forms and  locked in a cabinet in the study coordinator’s locked office.   
OnCore 
OnCore is a clinical trial management systems (CTMS)  which  will be used for recording and tracking regulatory 
approvals, staff training  and safety management (SAE tracking and IRB reporting). The CTMS system was 
developed by Forte Research and widely used across academic research universities nationwide. The program is 
a secure web -based system hosted by both the VCU and MCV health systems.  Only fully -trained, credentialed 
employees of VCU have access to this database.  The study coordinator will be the only individual (besides individuals that manage OnCore) with  access to data entered for this study into the OnCore database.  
SPUTUM SAMPLE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING  
Sputum collection is needed  for evaluation of biophysical propert ies. 
The study coordinator will ask the study subject to cough sputum into a provided, sterile sample cup at 9:00 AM according to the schedule of events outlined in Table 2. Study Procedures. If the subject is able to produce sputum 
before  this time, they will be provided the s terile sample cup and the sputum collected. All sputum samples will 
be transported on ice to the research laboratory as soon as possible on the day of screening and at follow-up. At 
baseline, intervention, and discharge, sputum will be delivered to the research laboratory on ice by 10:00 AM.    
All sputum samples will be identified by the Subject Identification Number and the applicable time -point only.   
 
 
 
Revised 25May2016 Version 4. 1                Page 8 of 10 SPUTUM SAMPLE ANALYSIS  
All collected sputum samples will be used for cough transport and mucus hydration measurements . 
In vitro  cough transportability 
A simulated cough machine is used to measure the airflow -dependent clearability of sputum. A model Plexiglas 
"trachea", rectangular in cross section (1.2 x 2 cm) is connected to an 8 L tank containing air pressurized to 8 psi 
giving a flow of about 11 L/s. A solenoid controls air release through a flow constrictive element used to mimic the airflow pattern of a natural cough. A sinusoidal constriction (length 7.7 cm and height 8 mm) is used to decrease the airway diameter while minimizing the turbulence (Reynolds number) of the system. A sample, 40 µl in volume and 0.5 mm in depth, is placed in a thin line across the base of the Plexiglas trachea. The bulk transport of the sample is measured in mm after a single cough maneuver. Three successive measurements are made and the results averaged (3).  
Mucus hydration (% solids), and mucus density  
A mucus sample is weighed in a microbalance and dried for 4 hours in a lyophilizer. The dried sample is then 
reweighed in order to calculate the percent solids composition. The density of the mucus is also calculated by dividing the weight of the sample by the volume. As the density of mucus should be 1.00 ± 0.15, this mea surement 
is used as a check on the validity of the hydration measurement. 
SLEEP DURATION ANALYSIS  
Actigraphy provides a precise measurement of the motion of the part of the body to which a device is attached. Sleep/wake patterns will be recorded using the Actiwatch
® 2. The data collected by the Actiwatch ® 2 will provide 
objective and reliable data of the subject ’s sleep/wake patterns during the study period without influence. The 
unique Subject Identification Number assigned at Day 0 will be the only identifier linking the subject and the actigraphy data. The device is similar in size to a wrist watch and is well- suited for use with younger subjects or 
those sensitive to wrist- worn devices. The data collected will be downloaded into a software program “Actiw are”.  
This software will be located on the Coordinator’s password protected computer.  T he data will then be scored 
and analyzed into predetermined intervals that will identify the epoch as either periods of wake or sleep . Statistics 
including Time in Bed  (TIB), Total Sleep Time (TST), Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO), Sleep Efficiency (SE) , 
Number of Wake Bouts (NWB) and Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) can be tracked over the study period.  
Data Analysis 
Statistical analysis of data will be performed using the JMP Pro 10 statistics package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Normality of data distribution will be visually checked and normally distributed data will be compared using two-tailed t-test and ANOVA. A p<  0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All results will be presented 
as means + the standard error of the mean.  
QUALITATIVE EVALUATION 
 One sleep and three separate quality of life evaluations will be administered at various time -points according to 
Table 2 - Study Procedures. The information provided by the questionnaires will be transposed into the REDCap 
database by the study coordinator. All paper documents will be de -identified,  the only identifier is the Subject 
Identification Number, which is kept in a locked cabinet, in the study coordinator’s locked office.   
 
 
Revised 25May2016 Version 4. 1                Page 9 of 10 Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire  (LSEQ)  
The Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) is a  10-i tem, subjective , self -report , 5-10 minute paper and 
pencil measure designed to assess changes in sleep quality over the  course of a psychopharmacological  treatment 
intervention. The scale evalu ates four domains:  ease of initiating sleep, quality of sleep, ea se of waking and 
behavior following wakefulness  using paper and pencil. Developers initially validated the LSEQ in individuals 
aged 18- 49 years. In the evaluation "initiating sleep" and the "quality  of sleep" factors were correlated with one 
another while "awakening from sleep" and "behavior following wakefulness" factors were also correlated.  Of the 
validated scales available to use for this study the LSEQ appears to be the most appropriate given the study being 
conducted.  
Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised (CFQ -R) 
The Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised (CFQ -R) is health -related quality of life (HRQ oL) measure for 
children, adolescents and adults with CF. Initially it was developed through interviews with CF patients and healthcare providers and var ious focus groups and has since undergone comprehensive reliability and validity 
testing. This revised questionnaire is one of the most widely used HRQ oL tests for CF. The CFQ -R measures 
how well an individual functions in a variety of domains, including P hysical Functioning, Vitality, Health 
Perceptions, Respiratory Symptoms, Treatment Burden, Role Functioning, Emotional Functioning, and Social Functioning. This questionnaire is written for the intended age group in regards to language and length of questionnaire.    
The Sino -Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT -20)  
The Sino- Nasal Outcome Test 20 (SNOT -20) is a validated, health- related quality of life (HRQ oL) questionnaire 
designed to determine the impact of nasal dysfunction on an individual’s social/emotional healt h. This test 
consists of 20 questions and asks patients to assess nasal symptoms, emotion, and activity on a scale of worsening 
symptoms scored 1 through 7 to provide a quantifiable score capable of disease severity.
1,2  
Non-validated device comfort survey  (VAS score)  
The non- validated device comfort survey used for this study will be conducted using a VAS score. The VAS 
(visual analog scale) will be used to measured characteristics, such as pain, that cannot be directly measured. The subject will be asked to point to a face depicting various levels of pain on a VAS that corresponds to the associated 
pain level when on HHNC and high- flow therap ies.

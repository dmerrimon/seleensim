BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR CONDUCTING THE TRIAL  
Endometriosis is an estrogen -dependent disease, pathologically characterized  by the presence of 
endometrial -like tissue abnormally implanted outside the uterus and primarily located on the pelvic 
peritoneum, ova ries, and rectovaginal septum. Symptoms of endometriosis often present as pain 
associated with menstruation (dysmenorrhea), non-menstrual pelvic pain , and pain during or afte r 
intercourse (dyspareunia).  
As a novel non -hormonal approach to the management of endo metriosis, dopamine receptor 
agonists have been suggested to inhibit the angiogenesis process that is essential for the 
development and maintenance of endometriotic  lesions . Quinagolide is a non-ergot -derived , potent 
and selective dopamine receptor 2 agoni st, which has been formulated into an extended -release 
vaginal ring for the treatment of endometriosis -related pain.  
Non-clinical and clinical data have suggested  evidence of the primary pharmacological effects of  
quinagolide in reduction of endometriotic lesions. In mice with induced endometriosis, a significant 
reduction in the size of active lesions, cellular proliferation index an d angiogenic gene expression 
was observed with oral quinagolide (50 o r 200 μg/kg p er day during a 14 -day period) versus 
vehicle. In a proof -of-concept study  involving hyperprolactinemic  patients with endometriosis, it 
was observed  at second -look laparoscopy that oral a dministration of quinagolide 25  µg to 75  µg 
once daily for 18 -20 week s induced a significant reduction in the overall size of endo metriotic 
lesions, in addition to histological evidence of tissue degeneration and down -regulation of vascular 
endothelial growth factor s (VEGF)  and pr oangiogenic cytokines.  
Intravaginal a dminis tration of quinagolide is well tolerated and has been shown to be  associated 
with higher bioavailability than oral admi nistration due to reduced first -pass metabolism.  Single 
administration of quinagolide  vaginal ring demonstrated a pharmacokinetic  (PK) profile of Tmax at 
36-48 hours and slowly declining plasma concentration over time for up to 35 days.  No dose 
accumulation was observed following sequential administration of quinagolide vaginal ring for  two 
menstrual cycles.

Vaginal Delivery System   
Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  METHODOLOGY  
This is a randomiz ed, double -blind, placebo -controlled, phase 2 trial assessing the efficacy, safety 
and dose -response of quinagolide extended -release vaginal rings administered sequentially for 4 
menstrual cycles in women with moderate to severe  endometriosis -related pain. In  this trial, a 
menstrual cycle is considered the period from day 7 of return of menses (RM+7) in a cycle until the 
following day 7 of return of menses in the next cycle.  Visit s on RM+7 can be scheduled on 
RM+6 -10, i.e. day 6 to day 10 of return of menses.   
The trial consists of the following periods:  
1) Screening: starting immediately after the signing of the informed consent (s) and including a 
run-in period of two complete menstrual cycles (cycle s -2 and -1) 
2) Treatment : double -blind, pla cebo -controlled treatment with three  doses of quinagolide 
extended -release vaginal ring  administered sequentially for four  menstrual cycles (cycle s 1, 2, 
3 and 4)  
3) Follow -up: p ost-treatment follow -up period of one menstrual cycle (cycle  5) 
 
Screening:  The screening period includes a wash -out period of approximately one month  (only 
applicable  to subjects currently using some hormonal product s such as  contraceptives ) and a run -in 
period of two complete menstrual cycles (cycles -2 and -1, applicable to all subjects ). Subjects who 
are currently using some hormonal products  such as  contraceptives , may be eligible for the trial if 
they h ave completed the  wash -out period . In this case, subject s need to sign the informed consent (s) 
before the y discontinue tho se product s. Discon tinuation of the products should follow the  labelling  
(e.g. completing the  current cycle of contraceptives before wash -out). Subjects requiring wash -out 
will not be provided wit h the electronic diary (e -Diary) or  rescue analgesics until the completion of  
the wash -out period, i.e. at  the run -in visit.  
Before entry into  run-in, all subjects will be asked to score the worst endome triosis -related pain 
from a recall of their experience during the past menstrual cycle  on a self -administered 11 -point  
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) with 0 indicating “no pain” and 10 indicating “worst imaginable 
pain” . After standardized  training of e -Diary use, eligible subjects will be instructed to record 
endometriosis -related pain, vaginal bleeding, occurrence of sexual intercourse and analgesic use in 
the e -Diary on a daily basis. Impact of endometriosis -related pain on functioning will be assessed 
by subjects on both a daily and a weekly basis.  
In this trial, endometriosis -related pain is evaluated as the pain located in the abdominal -pelvic area 
and the lower back area. During the run-in period, subjects will score the worst endometriosis -
related pain during the preceding 24 hours on the NRS  before bedtime every night in the e -Diary.    
Vaginal bleeding will be recorded as “yes” or “no” on a daily basis in the e -Diary . If there is  
vaginal bleeding,  subjects will be asked to register their bleeding volume (spotting, light, moderate 
or heavy bleeding) and to answer whether they think the bleeding is related to menses or not . Based 
on the subject ’s impression of whether she has  menstrual bleeding or no t, the NRS score obtained 
for the endometriosis -related pain is assigned to dysmenorrhea ( endometriosis -related pain on days 
with menstrual bleeding)  or to non-menstrual pelvic pain (endometriosis -related pain on days with 
no menstrual  bleeding ).  
Occurren ce of sexual intercourse ( “yes” or “no”) will also be recorded in the e -Diary. In case of 
sexual intercourse, subjects will be asked to score the worst pain experienced during or after

is due to expected pain.  
Rescue analgesics for endometriosis -related pain will be limited to ibuprofen and/or hydrocodone -
acetaminophen in this trial. As a mild analgesic, ibuprofen will be provided to subjects in the form 
of 200 mg oral tablets  for their use  on an as-needed  basis . Subjects will be instructed not to use 
other analges ics unless necessary . If there is a need to change  analgesics , subjects  should  discuss  
with investigators , who may prescribe  a strong analgesic , i.e. 5 mg hydrocodone  plus 300 mg or  
325 mg acetaminophen . Use of any other analgesics for endometriosis -relate d pain is prohibited. 
Any pro phylactic use of analgesics is also prohibited in this trial. Use of analgesics for 
endometriosis -related pain  will be reported by subjects in the e -Diary  on a daily basis .   
The impact of the endometriosis -related pain on different aspects of functioning will be assessed by 
subject s both on the NRS  on a daily basis and by the modified EHP -30 pain impact domain (i.e. the 
first 11 items plus an additional work item) on a weekly basis.  
Treatment : Subjects will be rand omiz ed on RM+ 7 of cycle -1 (at visit 4) if they, during the run-in 
period , have  moderate to severe endometriosis -related pain, which is defined as having a mean 
daily NRS score of ≥ 4 for the worst endometriosis -related pain during each run -in menstrual cycle.  
Randomiz ation will be performed in a 1:1:1:1 rat io to quinagolide vaginal ring  dose load  360 µg at 
a targe t release rate of quinagolide 4 .5 µg/day , quinagolide vaginal ring dose load 720  µg at a target 
release rate of quinagolide 9 µg/day , quinagolide vaginal ring dose load 108 0 µg at a targ et release 
rate of quinagolide 13 .5 µg/day  or placebo vaginal ring for four  menstrual cycles (cycles 1, 2, 3 and 
4).  
Follow -up: Subjects will be followe d up for one menstrual cycle (cycle  5). 
From randomiz ation to follow -up (cycle  1 to cycle 5), subjects will continue  to use an e -Diary  to 
score the endometriosis -related pain , to register vaginal bleeding pattern , occurrence of sexual 
intercourse  and the analgesic use  as well as  to assess the impact of the worst endometriosis -related 
pain on functioning , as they have done  in the  run-in period .  
Durin g the treatment period , subjects will self-insert the assigned ring i n the upper part of the 
vagina on RM+7  of cycle 1 to cycle 4 at the clinic  by following standard instructions for use . 
Supervision by  the site staff can be provided if needed . After insertion, the vaginal ring will be kept 
in the vagina continuously for on e menstrual cycle until being replaced with the next ring on RM+7 
of the next cycle when the subject visits the clinic. Acceptability  of the ring will be assessed by 
subject s via a ring acceptability questionnaire at each RM+7  visit during the treatment pe riod. 
Unless under other effective birth control permitted by protocol, s ubjects will be required to use a 
non-hormonal single -barrier contraception (i.e. condom)  from wash -out (if applicable) or run -in to 
end-of-trial. Contraception counselling and condom s will be offered to subjects throughout the trial.  
B&B w ill be administered electronically at randomization  and at cycle  4 (at visits 4  and 10), with 
trained trial coordinators completing the first part based on subjects’ verbal responses and 
investigators completing the second part based on findings of a pelvic examination . Subjects will 
complete the electronic  version of the EHP -30 questionnaire  at randomization , and a t every  cycle 
from cycle 1 to cycle 4 (at visits 4, 6, 7, 8 and 1 0). PGIS  scale will be com pleted electronically by 
subjects a t cycle -2, at randomiz ation and a t cycle  4 (at visits 2, 4  and 1 0), while PGIC  scale will be 
completed electronically at cycle  4 (at visit 1 0).

 Quinagolide, FE 999051  Trial C ode: 000165  
Vaginal Delivery System   
Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Blood samples will be collected throughout the trial for the purpose of evaluating mid-luteal phase 
endocrine parameters, bone turnover markers, endometriosis biomarkers, quinagolide and 
metabolites, and routine safety laboratory parameters. In this trial,  mid-luteal phase is defined as 
6-9 days after luteiniz ing hormone (LH) surge (LH+6 -9) as tested by subjects at home by means of 
commercially a vailable urinary LH kits . LH+7 visits can be scheduled on LH+6 -9, either based on 
an actual LH surge date as indi cated by  a positive LH surg e test or based on an estimated LH surge 
date according to subjects’ cycle length i f subjects  fail to detect the LH surge . The exact cycle day 
of the LH+7 visit will be derived based on the first menstrual bleeding date of the cu rrent cycle 
confirmed at the RM+7 visits. A n endocrine panel including estradiol, progesterone, prolactin , TSH  
and IGF-1 will be assessed during  the mid -luteal phase of cycles -1 and 4 (at visits 3  and 9). 
Evidence of ovulation  will be evaluated  by serum levels of mid -luteal progesterone . Fasting blood 
samples for the analysis of a bone formation marker  (s-PINP ) and a bone resorption marker  (s-CTx) 
will be collected during cycles  -1 and 4 (at visits 3  and 9). Blood samples for endometriosis 
biomarkers including , but not limited to , VEGF, PlGF , IL-6 and sFlt -1 will also be collected  during 
cycles -1 and 4 (at visits 3  and 9). At the same time points,  if subjects have provided a separate 
informed consent, additional blood samples for potential analyses of  circulating cell -free DNA and 
microRNA  will also be collected . Routine safety laboratory tests for clinical chemistry  and 
hematology  parameters will be performed during cycle  -1, at end -of-treatment and  end-of-trial (at 
visits 3, 10 and 11). Quinagolide and metabolites will be measured within 1 -5 days of first ring 
insertion, at RM+7 visits  of cycles 1 , 3 and 4 as well as at  LH+7 visit of cycle 4 (at visits 5, 6, 8, 9 
and 10) to assess systemic exposure and allow for population PK modelling . Blood samples should 
be taken prior to ring removal at RM+7 visits. If subjects have provided a separate informed 
consent, a blood sample for pharmacogenetic analysis will also be collected at visit 5.  
ECG and echocardiography  will be performed  at screeni ng and at end -of-treatment to monitor 
cardiovascular safety . ECG and  echocardiography  at screening can be arranged anytime during 
cycle  -1 e.g. at LH+7 visit (visit  3) but results must be available prior to randomization . ECG and 
echocardiography  at cycle 4  can be performed w ithin ±2  weeks of visit 10.  
A modified questionnaire for impulsive -compulsive disorders (QICD) will be completed  
electronically  by trained  trial coordinator s based on subjects ’ verbal response  prior to  
randomization  at cycle s -1 and 4 (at visits 4  and 1 0).  
A urine pregnancy test will be performed at each clinic visit (except for visit 5) throughout the trial. 
If the test result is positive  and is confirmed by  a following serum βhCG test,  the subject sho uld be 
discontinued  from the trial . Urinalysis is performed before entry into run -in (before or at visit 1)  
and at cycle  4 (at visit  10).  
All subjects  will be asked which treatment they believe they have received  at the end of treatment . 
A sub -group of 60 subjects  including 5 non -completers  from selected sites, if they  have provided a 
separate informed consent , will be invited to participate in a patient interview  at the end of 
treatment  to help determine the meaningful treatment benefit from the patients’ perspective  and to 
assess the content validity of the questions related to daily functioning  in the e-Diary .   
An internal Clinical Monitoring  Committee consisting of the responsible medica l officer, 
statistician and clinical trial manage r will be established to regularly review the trial data including  
data with respect to the pre -defined stopping criteria in a blinded manner. An independent  Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC ) consisting of exc lusive ly external members  will also be established.

An interim analysis is planned when approximately half of the planned evaluable subjects 
(104 subjects) have completed the treatment p eriod  of the trial for the assessment of the primary 
endpoint . The data will be prepared by treatment group by an external  statistician. The purpose of 
the interim analysis is to evaluate futility of the trial and to adjust sample size  if needed .  
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  
It is planned to screen around 5 90 subjects to randomiz e 280 subject s (70 subjects per treatment 
group ) to achieve 208 evaluable subjects at the end of treatment . The sample siz e will be 
re-estimated by an external  statistician during an  interim analysis  and the  number of randomiz ed 
subjects may be adjusted up to 360.

INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS  
Quinagolide vaginal ring is a n extended -release system with a dose load of quinagolide 360 µg, 
720 µg and 108 0 µg at a target  daily release rate of quinagolide 4 .5 µg/day, 9 µg/day  and 
13.5 µg/day, respectively,  for up to 35 days duration.  
– Quinagolide vaginal ring dose load 360 µg at a target release rate of quinagolide 4.5 µg/day: 
administered once per menstrual cycle (up to 35 days), sequentially for four menstrual cycles  
– Quinagolide vaginal ring dose load 720 µg at a target release rate of quinagolide 9  µg/day: 
administered once per menstrual cycle (up to 35 days), sequen tially for four  menstrual cycles  
– Quinagolide vaginal ring dose load 1080 µg at a target release rate of  quinagolide 13.5 µg/day: 
administered once per menstrual cycle (up to 35 days), sequentially for four menstrual cycles  
– Placebo vaginal ring: administered once per menstrual cycle (up to 35 days ), sequentially for 
four menstrual cycles  
DURATION OF TREATME NT  
Subjects will be expo sed to placebo vaginal ring or quinagolide vaginal ring for 4 menstrual cycles, 
depending on randomization . 
STATISTICAL METHODS  
Primary Endpoint A nalysis  
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of three doses of quinagolide 
administered as an extended -release vaginal ring compared to placebo on reduction of moderate to 
severe endometriosis -related pain . The p rimary endpoint is the change  in mean daily NRS score for 
the worst endometriosis -related pain  at cycle 4 . 
The participating subjects will record their NRS score daily throughout each menstrual cycle. For 
each cycle the daily recordings will be averaged to calculate  the mean dai ly NRS score. The mean 
daily NRS score obtained during the  two run-in menstrual cycle s (cycles -2 and -1) will be 
considered the baseline mean daily NRS score. The primary endpoint will be derived as the 
difference between the mea n daily NRS score for cycle 4 and the baseline mean daily NRS score.   
The primary endpoint will be analyzed  using a repeated measures  analysis of covariance

2, 3 and 4 as dependent variable , the baseline mean daily NRS score  and the baseline percentage  of 
days on rescue analgesics by type as covariate s, as well as  treatment group and treatment by cycle 
as fixed effect. Unstructured error -covariance matrices will be used. The treatmen t contra sts 
between each active treatment  versus placebo at cycle 4 will be reported with 95% confidence 
intervals and correspond ing p -values.  
The primary analysis will be base d on observed cases in the intention -to-treat ( ITT) analysis set , 
while the analysis based on the per-protocol (PP) population  will be considered supportive  and 
serve as one of the sensitivity analyses. Other sens itivity analyses focus, among other things, on : 
• the impact of missing data if assum ing missing not at rando m by applying a plac ebo-based 
pattern mixture model   
• the heterogeneit y of the effect in terms of baseline mean daily NRS score, percentage  of 
days on rescue analgesics by type  at baseline by testing respective treatment interactions  
• the impact of also adjusting the ANCOVA model for the percentage of days on rescue 
analgesics by type at cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4 (time dependent)  and the impact of changing 
baseline NRS score from a daily mean of two run -in cycles to that of the last run -in cycle  
 
Secondary Endpoint A nalysis  
Secondary efficacy endpoints are analyzed  longitudinally  by applying repeated measures 
ANCOVA for  continuous endpoints, repeated measures logistic -regression using the generaliz ed 
estimating equation (GEE ) approach and logit link fu nction for binary data, and repeated measures 
negative -binomial regression analysis using the GEE approach with log link function for count 
data. Unstructured error -covariance matrices will be used. In addition, time to first occurrence of 
response will be  analyzed  using proportional odds regression. Secondary safety endpoints will be 
analyzed for  the safety analysis set, whereas all other endpoints will be analyzed  for both the ITT 
and PP populations.  
 
Interim Analysis  
An interi m analysis with the option to stop  the trial early due to  futility  will be performed by an 
external  statistician when approximately half of the planned evaluable subjects  (104 subjects) have 
completed the treatment p eriod  of the trial for the assessment of  the primary endpoint using 
unblinded data. The futility bound is set at a conditional power using current trend equal to 5% , i.e. 
the trial could be potentially stopped for futility if the probability of achiev ing a significant result in 
the highest remaining dose group  is lower than 5% based on the observed data at the interim  
analysis . In case of high drop -out rate or discontinuations  in the highest dose group , the analysis 
will be performed on the remaining d ose(s). No interim analysis intended to stop the trial early due 
to overwhelming efficacy is planned . 
 
Sample Size Calculations  
The sample size calculation is based on demonstrating superiority of quinagolide vaginal ring 
compared with placebo vaginal ring  on the primary endpoint  of change  in mean daily NRS score  
for the endometriosis -related pain  at cycle  4.

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Assuming that the  standard deviation of  the change in mean daily NRS is 1.5 units, a sample size of 
52 evaluable subjects per group  will have at least 90% power to detect a treatment effect difference 
of 1.0 unit using a t -test at a 5% two -sided significance level  in a pre -defined hierarchical step -
down procedure  starting with testing the highest dose versus  placebo , taking into accou nt the 
planned interim analysi s for futility at a conditional power using current trend equal to 5% . 
Accounting for an approximately  25% drop-out rate, 70 subjects should be randomiz ed to each 
treatment group , i.e. in total  280 subjects should be randomiz ed. A sample size r e-estimat ion will 
be performed by the external  statistician at the same time of  the interim analysis . The sample size 
may be increased t o 360 subjects .

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Endometriosis is an estrogen -dependent disease, pathologically characterized  by the presence of 
endometrial -like tissue abnorma lly implanted outside the uter us and primarily  located on the pelvic 
peritoneum, ovaries, and rectovaginal septum.1 Symptoms of endometriosis often  present as pain 
associated with menstruation (dysmenorrhea), non-menstrual pelvic pain , and pain during or after 
intercourse (dyspareunia) .2,3 Endometriosis is estimated to affect 6% to 10% of women of 
reproductive age and up to 50% of women with infertility.4,5 Affected women  can lose up to 10 
working hours  weekly, mainly owing to reduced effectiveness whilst working.6 It has been 
estimated t hat, in the United States, the costs of diagnosing endometriosis and treating associated 
pain and i nfertility is in excess of $50  billion per annum  and yet, treatment options remain 
inadequate .7  
Treatment of endometriosis -related pain currently involves repeated courses of medical therapy, 
surgical therapy, or both. Empirical treatment with analgesics  and combined oral contraceptives , 
without prior definitive diagnosis of endometriosis by laparoscopy, is usual ly the first line treatment 
especially in adolescents.8 Self-administered non -steroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ) are 
commonly used initially to relieve pain symptoms associated with endometriosis, but the 
effectiveness is not well established.3 All established hormonal therapies  (progest ins, gonadotropin 
releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and danazol) a re similarly effective . However, s ome of these 
drugs are ass ociated with anti-ovulatory effect leading  to amenorrhea and  oligomenorrhea  or with 
hypoestrogenic effect  such as  bone l oss and vasomotor symptoms, all of which limit the ir duration 
of use  and result in undesirable iatrogenic sterility in women seeking conception .9,10 Long -term 
treatment of endometriosis without undesirable anti -ovulatory or hypoestrogenic effect s remains an 
unmet medical need.  
As a novel non -hormonal approach to the management  of endome triosis, dopamine receptor 
agonists have been suggested to inhibit the angiogenesis process that is essential for the 
developme nt and maintenance  of endo metriotic  lesions . Non-clinical and clinical data have 
suggested  evidence of  the primary pharmacologica l effects of dopamine receptor agonists in 
reduction of endometriotic lesions.   
Quinagolide is a non-ergot -derived , potent and selective dopamine receptor  2 agonist . Quina golide 
is available in some countries outside the United States as oral tablets for the treatment of 
hyperprolactinemia  with extensive post -marketing experience. In addition, it  has been formulated 
into an extended -release vaginal ring for the treat ment of e ndometriosis -related pa in. The vaginal 
ring allows extended rele ase of quinagolide for up to 35  days and can be replaced by a new vaginal 
ring in every menstrual cycle.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial  
As an integral part of the endometriosis pathogenesis, the establishment of a new blood supply is 
essential for survival and growth of endometriotic tissues when implanted outside the u terine 
cavity. This angiogenesis process is a critical mechanism that allows the development of 
endometriosis. The most prominently studied angiogenic factor is vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF), which has been noted in endometriotic lesions, endom etriomas and the peritoneal 
fluid of endometriosis patients.12,13,14 A positive correlation between the severity of endometriosis 
and the level of VEGF concentration in peritoneal fluid has been  observed.14  
Dopamine 2 receptors are present in ectopic endometrium.15 Dopamine agonist -mediated d opamine 
receptor 2 activation promotes VEGF receptor 2 endocytosis, preventing b inding of VEGF to 
VEGF receptor  2. Administration of dopamine r eceptor 2 agonists was  shown to reduce vascular 
permeability without affecting corpus luteum angiogenesis and function by partially inhibiting 
VEGF  receptor 2  phosphorylation.16 In addition, it has been  shown  that dopamine recep tor 2 
agonists diminish nerve fibre density in experimental endometriotic lesions.17  
Non-clinical and clinical data have suggested  evidence of primary pharmacological effects of 
quinagolide  in reduction of endometriotic lesions. In mice with induced endom etriosis, a significant 
reduction in the size of active lesions, cellular proliferation index and angiogenic gene expression 
was observed with oral quinagolide (50 or 200  μg/kg per day during a 14 -day period) versus 
vehicle.18 In a proof -of-concept clinica l trial involving  9 hyperprolactinemic  patients with 
endometriosis , it was observ ed at second -look laparoscopy that oral administration of quinagolide 
25 µg to 75 µg once daily for 18 -20 weeks induced a significant reduction in the overall size of 
endometriotic lesions, together with histological evidence of tissue degeneration and down -
regulation  of VEGF and proangiogenic cytokines.19  
Three phase 1 trials have been conducted in Germany and the United Kingdom  with intravaginal 
administration of quinagolide in healthy volunteers . Intravaginal administration of quinagolide 
tablets has been shown to be associated with higher bioavailability than oral administration due to 
reduced first pass metabolism  in a single and multiple ascending dose trial compa ring intravaginal 
and oral admini stration (Trial 000076). Following s ingle a dministration of quinagolide vaginal ring 
at a target  release rate of quinagolide 4. 5 µg/day, 9 µg/day or 13.5 µg/day a, Tmax was reached at 36-
48 hours for all three doses  and plasma concentration slowly declined over time for up to 35 days 
(Trial 000155). Furthermore, no dose accumulation and no impact on ovarian fun ction or  menstrual 
cyclicity  were observed  following sequential  administration of quinagolide vaginal ring s for two 
menstrual cycles  (Trial 000207).  
 
a The three strengths of quinagolide vaginal ring investigated in phase 1 trials are expressed in the content of 
quinagolide hydrochloride instead of quinagolide. The exact quantities of drug substance are minimally adjusted for 
the present trial due to a minor change in ring manufacturing . Quinagolide vaginal rings in phase 1 trials contain a 
dose load  of quinagolide hydrochloride 400  µg, 800 µg and 12 00 µg corresponding to a target release rat e of 
quinagolide hydrochloride 5 µg/day, 10  µg/day and 15 µg/day,  respectively, which are equivalent to a tar get release 
rate of quinagolide 4.5  µg/day, 9  µg/day and 13 .5 µg/day.

Vaginal Delivery System   
Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Vaginal ring administration of quinagolide  avoids  repeated rapid daily rises of quinagolide  levels as 
seen with oral admi nistration and thereby  has improve d tolerability of quinagolide based on safety 
evaluations i n phase 1 trials . In addition , an extended -release formulation with replacement of the 
vaginal ring every menst rual cycle is more suitable for the long -term management of endometriosis 
than a daily formulation .  
In summary, a s a novel non -horm onal drug  inhibiting angiogenesis , quinagolide  has the potential to 
address the unmet medical need for long -term treatmen t of endometriosis . Since quinagolide 
vaginal rings were shown to have favorable  pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles without any anti -
ovulato ry or other undesirable side effects in the  phase 1 trials, it is now possible  to investigate the 
effect of quinagolide on reduction of moderate and se vere endometriosis -related pain in 
endometriosis  patients . The present pha se 2 trial therefore aims at assessing  the efficacy , safety and 
dose-response  of three doses of quinagolide vaginal ring s compared to placebo in women with  
moderate and se vere endometriosis -related pain. The outcome  of the present trial will help identify 
the appropriate  dose(s) to be  used for future trials.  
 
1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects  
Benefits  
Subjects will be randomiz ed in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo or one of the  three quinagolide dose s for 
four menstrual cycles . This means that 75% of endometriosi s patients in the trial will be  initial ly 
randomiz ed to an active treatment  and may benefit from  relief of their endometriosis -related pain if 
the treatment is effective . All subjects in the trial will be provided with rescue analgesics to manage 
their endometriosis -related pain in case of insu fficient pain relief. All subjects included in the trial 
will also benefit from  close  and comprehensi ve monitoring of their conditions .  
It should be noted that t he treatment and trial -related procedures are  provided to the participating 
subjects free of charge, as Ferring compensates the investigat ional sites for their expenses.   
 
Risks  
The risks associated with this clinical trial, including the risk s of investigational medicinal product  
(IMP) , clinical and  laboratory p rocedures  and concomitant medications , are explained to subjects as 
part of the counselling prior to starting treatment.  
Risks – Investigational Medicinal Product  
In the clinical development program  for endometriosis, quinagolide has been inv estigated 
intravaginally in a total of 111  women in phase 1 trials , of whom 23 were administered tablets at 
daily doses up to 75 µg  and 88 were administered vaginal rings at a target  release rate of up to 
13.5 µg/day. In all trials, intravaginal administration of quinagolide was generally safe and well 
tolerated . The most common treatment -related adverse events with quinagolide vaginal rings (i.e. at 
a frequency of ≥5%, reported by more than 4 subjects ) in phase 1 trials were  headache , vaginal

trials is provided in the paragraphs below.  
A lower frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events, i.e. nausea and v omiting, was reported 
following intravagina l administration  of quinagolide 75  µg tablets once daily for 5 days , compared 
with oral administration  (Trial 000076 ). The most frequently reported adverse events (i.e. reported 
by more than 1 subject ) following intravaginal administration of quinagolide t ablets were headache, 
dizziness and vaginal discharge. Single administration of quinagolide vaginal ring  at a target release 
rate of quinagolide 4.5 µg/day, 9  µg/day and 13. 5 µg/day was locally and systemically well 
tolerated with t he most frequently reported  adverse events  being  headache, vaginal discharge and 
nausea  (Trial 000155) . The majority of adverse events occurring in all treatment groups including 
the placebo group started d uring the first week of treatment and were considered to be of mild or 
moderate intensity. No inhibition of ovulation  or modification o f the menstrual cycle  was observed 
during sequential  administration of quinagolide vaginal ring at a target release rate of up to 
13.5 µg/day  (Trial 000207 ). In addition , quinagolide had no clinically significant effects on clinical 
chemistry, hematology  or urinalysis parameters, nor on vital signs, electrocardiography ( ECG ) 
recordings, physical or gynecological  examinations  in any of the phase 1 trials .  
Insertion and/or removal of the vaginal rings may be associated with mild discomfort or spotting, 
which is expected to be transient. Ring discoloration  or breakage at glued junction points  could also 
occur  but based on the phase 1 data, there has been no safety concerns associated with these 
findings . New rings manufactured in a different way (i.e.  injection -molded  rings instead of glued  
rings) will be used in the present trial.    
Quinagolide  is currently marketed outside the United States  as an oral tablet formulation for the 
treatment of hyperprolactinemia . The estimated cumulative exposure of quinagolide until now is 
more than 280,000 patient years , when administered as an oral tablet in the approved dose range of 
25-300 µg or higher . The general safety profile of quinagolide is consistent with the class effects of 
other dopamine agonists, characterized  by adverse events involving the gastrointestinal tract and 
central nervous system. The most frequent adverse drug reaction s (all reported as very common, i.e. 
at a frequency of ≥10%) in relation to oral administration of quinagolide tablets are nausea, 
vomiting, headache, dizziness and fatigue. They occur predominantly during the first few days of 
the initial treatment or, as a mostly transient event, following dosage increase.  
A serious but very rare risk associated with quinagolide oral tablet s is synco pe (<0.01%) , which can 
be resulted from o rthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension occur s at a frequency of 1 -10% 
among patients treated with quinagolide oral tablets. Somnolence rarely (i.e. at a frequency of 
0.01% to 0.1%) occur s during treatment w ith quinagolide  oral tablets . Dopamine agonists other 
than quinagolide have been associated with sudden sleep onset episodes, particularly in patients 
with Parkinson’s disease, and this has resulted in a general warning for the entire class of drugs. In 
rare cases  (i.e. at a frequency of 0.01% to 0.1%) , treatment with dopamine agonists  has been 
associated with the occurrence of acute psychosis, which is reversible upon discontinuation.20

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  compulsive spending or buying, bin ge eating and compulsive eating  were rarely  reported in 
association with the use of dopamine receptor agonists in cluding quinagolide for the  treatment of 
Parkinson’s disease .21 Ergot -derived dopamine agonists have been associated with an increased risk 
of fibrosis of the heart valves possibly through activation of 5-hydroxytryptamin  2B receptor  (5-
HT2B) . Quinago lide is a non-ergot -derived  dopamine agonist and does not  have any 5 -HT-receptor 
activity at clinically relevant doses.22,23 Furthermore, no cases of valvular heart disease have been 
reported  with quinagolide . 
Quinagolide  is not a n embryotoxic or teratogenic agent. N o adverse effects on embryos or fetuses  
were observed in the reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits .11 Based on clinical data  for 
the treatment of hyperprolactinemia , pregnancy outcome data are  available for 145 pregnancies  in 
women exposed to quinagolide , with 106 pregnancies leading to  live births . Among the 110 live-
born neonates , a total of 5  malformations (4.5%) were r eported , which is comparable  to the  5-6% 
malformation rate reported a mong registered births .24 In terms of  pregnancy loss , 24 (16.6%) 
spontaneous abortion sb were reported following exposure to quinagolide , which is similar to the 
15-16% spontaneous abortion rate reported in the general population.25 In addition, quinagolide has 
been investigated for the prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) in an in vitro 
fertilization  study , in which 85 live births  were  reported following treatment with  oral quinagolide  
tablets up to 200 µg/day for approximately 20 days without dose titration .26 Quina golide did not 
appear to show any detrimental effect s on implantation, pregnancy or live birth rates.26 In 
conclusion,  exposure to quinagolide during early pregnancy has not been shown to increase  the risk 
of pregnancy losses  or congenital malformations  compared with a normal pregnant population . 
Contraception counselling will be offered throughout the trial and condoms  will be provided to all 
subjects at each clinic visit to avoid occurrence of pregnan cy during  participation of the trial . As a 
precautionary measure , a urine pregnancy test will be performed at least once per menstrual cycle 
in the present trial. If the test result is positive and confirmed by a serum βhCG test, the subject  will 
be discontinued from t he trial  immediately  and will be followed up  until delivery (see section 8.4).  
For further information regarding quinagolide, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure .11 
Risks – Trial Procedures and Concomitant Medications  
The primary endpoint and secondary efficacy endpoints in this trial are patient -reported outcome 
(PRO) measures that require the subjects’  daily assessment s of pain intensity, vaginal bleeding 
pattern, occurrence of sexual  intercourse, analgesic use as well as daily and weekly  assessment s of 
pain impact, all of w hich impose  no risks to  subjects participating in the trial .  
A few p rocedures will be  performed at the investigational sites  in this trial , i.e. transvaginal 
ultrasound , blood sampling , ECG , echocardiography , urin e pregnancy test  and urinalysis , which  are 
either minimally invasive  or non -invasive  to subjects. The transvaginal ultraso und examinations 
may be associated with mild discomfort and a very rare risk of infection. The blood sampling might 
be associated with mild disc omfort, bruising and a very rare  risk of infection.  ECG  and 
 
b  Other pregnancy losses included 14 induced abortions (with 1 due to malformation) and 1 ectopic pregnancy.

where the electrodes are attached.  Urine pregnancy tests  and urinalysis , simply requiring subjects to 
urinate, im pose no risks to subjects .  
All s ubjects in this trial will be provided with rescue analgesics in the form of ibuprofen  200 mg , 
which is an  approved medic inal product  for pain relief and considered generally well -tolerated . The 
most frequent ly reported  adverse e ffects with ibuprofen  are gastroi ntestinal in nature a nd include  
nausea , vomiting, flatulence and diarrhea . Additional adverse effects  may occur at high doses and 
under long -term treatment.27 Clinical studies suggest use of ibuprofen, particularly at high doses 
(2400  mg/day), may be associated with a small in creased risk of arterial thrombotic events ( e.g. 
myocardial infarction or stroke).27 Upper gastrointestinal  ulcers, gross bleed ing or perforation can 
occur in approximately 1% of patients treated with ibuprofen for 3 -6 months.27  
If needed, a strong analgesic hydrocodone -acetaminophen may be prescribed by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction s with hydrocodone -acetaminophen are light -
headedne ss, dizziness , sedation, nausea and vomiting .28 Additional adverse effects may occur at 
overdose, under long -term treatment  and during concomitant intake of alcohol or other drugs . The 
use of hydrocodone -acetaminophen  may also cause mental or physical dependence , opioid 
addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death . Serious, life -threatening or fatal 
respiratory depression may occur with use of hydrocodone -acetaminophen. Acetaminophen has 
been associated with cases of acute liver failure, at times resulting in liver transplant and death. 
Most of the cases of liver inj ury are associated with the use of acetaminophen at doses that exceed 
4000 mg per day, and often involve more than one ac etaminophen -containing product.28 
The i nvestigator  must assess each subject’s risks prior to prescription of hydrocodone -
acetaminophen .

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  3.1.2 Overall Design and Control Methods  
This is a randomiz ed, double -blind, placebo -controlled, phase 2 trial assessing the efficacy, safety 
and dose -response of quinagolide extended -release vaginal rings administered sequentially for 
4 menstrual cycles in women with moderate to severe endometriosis -related pain.  In this trial, a 
menstrual cycle is considered the period from day 7 of return of menses (RM+7) in a cycle until the 
following day 7 of return of menses in the next cycle.  Visits on RM+7 can be scheduled on 
RM+6 -10, i.e. day 6 to day 10 of return of mense s.  
The trial consists of the following periods:  
1) Screening: starting immediately after the signing of the informed consent(s) and including a 
run-in period of two complete menstrual cycles (cycles -2 and -1) 
2) Treatment : double -blind, placebo -controlled trea tment with three  doses of quinagolide 
extended -release vaginal ring administered sequentially for four menstrual cycles (cycles 1, 2, 
3 and 4)  
3) Follow -up: post -treatment follow -up period of one menstrual cycle (cycle 5) 
 
Screening:  The screening period includes a wash -out period of approximately one month  (only 
applicable to subjects currently using some hormonal products such as  contraceptives c) and a run -
in period of two complete menstrual cycles (cycles -2 and -1, applicable to all subjects). Subjects 
who are curren tly using some hormonal product s such as contraceptives  c may be eligible for the 
trial if they h ave completed the wash -out period . In this case, subjects need to sign the informed 
consent (s) before th ey discontinue tho se product s. Discontinuation of the product s should fol low 
the labelli ng (e.g. completing the  current cycle of contraceptives before wash -out). Subjects 
requiring wash -out will not be provided with the electron ic diary (e -Diary) or  rescue analgesics 
until the completion of  the wash -out period, i.e. at  the run -in visit.  
Befo re entry into  run-in, all subjects will be asked to score the worst endometriosis -related pain 
from a recall of their experience during the past menstrual cycle  on a self -administered 11 -point  
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) with 0 indicating “no pain” and 10 indicating “worst imaginable 
pain” . After standardized  training of e -Diary use, eligible subjects will be instructed to record 
endometriosis -related pain, vaginal bleeding, occurrence of sexu al intercourse and analgesic use in 
the e -Diary on a daily basis. Impact of endometriosis -related pain on functioning will be assessed 
by subjects on both a daily and a weekly basis.  
In this trial, endometriosis -related pain is evaluated as the pain locat ed in the abdominal -pelvic area 
and the lower back area. During the run -in period, subjects will score the worst endometriosis -
related pain during the preceding 24 hours on the NRS  before bedtime every night in the e -Diary.   
 
c  Hormonal products requiring  1 month wash -out include GnRH antagonists , aromatase inhibitors, danazol and  
 hormonal contraceptives (including combined oral contraceptive pill, progestin -only pill, transdermal patch and 
 contraceptive ring ). See section 4.3.1 .

Vaginal Delivery System   
Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Vaginal bleeding will be recor ded as “yes” or “no” on a daily basis in the e -Diary. If there is 
vaginal bleeding, subjects will be asked to register their bleeding volume (spotting, light, moderate 
or heavy bleeding) and to answer whether they think the bleeding is related to menses or  not. Based 
on the subject ’s impression of whether she has  menstrual bleeding or not , the NRS score obtained 
for the endometriosis -related pain is assigned to dysmenorrhea ( endometriosis -related pain on days 
with menstrual bleeding)  or to non-menstrual pel vic pain (endometriosis -related pain on days with 
no menstrual bleeding) .  
Occurrence of sexual intercourse ( “yes” or “no”) will also be recorded in the e -Diary. In case of 
sexual intercourse, subjects will be asked to score the worst pain experienced duri ng or after 
intercourse (dys pareunia) on the  NRS. In case of no sexual intercourse, subjects will be asked if it 
is due to expected pain.  
Rescue analgesics for endometriosis -related pain will be limited to ibuprofen and /or hydrocodone -
acetaminophen in thi s trial. As a mild analgesic, ibuprofen will be provided to subjects in the form 
of 200 mg oral tablets  for their use on an as -needed basis. Subjects will be instructed not to use 
other analgesics unless necessary. If there is a need to change analgesics , subjects should discuss 
with investigators, who may prescribe a strong analgesic , i.e. 5 mg hydrocodone  plus 300 mg or 
325 mg acetaminophen  (section 7.2.1.5 ). Use of any other analgesics for endometriosis -related pain 
is prohibited. Any prophylactic use of analgesics is also prohibited in this trial. Use of analgesic s 
for endometriosis -related pa in will be reported by subjects in the e -Diary  on a daily basis .  
The impact of the endometriosis -related pain on different aspects of functioning will be assessed by 
subjects both on the NRS on a daily basis and by the modified EHP -30 pain impact domain ( i.e. the 
first 11 items plus an additiona l work item) on a weekly basis.d 
Treatment : Subjects will be randomiz ed on RM+ 7 of cycle -1 (at visit 4) if they, during the run -in 
period have  moderate to severe endometriosis -related pain, which is defined as having a mean daily 
NRS score of ≥ 4 for the worst endometriosis -related pain during each run -in menstrual cycle.  
Randomiz ation will be performed in a 1:1:1:1 rat io to quinagolide vaginal ring dose load 36 0 µg at 
a target r elease rate of quinagolide 4 .5 µg/day, quinagolide vaginal ring dose load 720 µg at a targe t 
release rate of quinagolide 9  µg/day, quinagolide vaginal ring  dose load 1 080 µg at a target release 
rate o f quinagolide 13 .5 µg/day  or placebo vaginal ring for four menstrual cycles (cycles 1, 2, 3 and 
4).  
Follow -up: Subjects will be followed up fo r one menstrual cycle (cycle 5). 
From randomization  to follow -up (cycle 1 to cycle 5), subjects will continue to use an e -Diary to 
score the endometriosis -related pain, to register vaginal bleeding pa ttern, occurrence of sexual 
intercourse and the analgesic use a s well as  to assess the impact of the worst endometriosis -related 
pain on functioning, as they have done in the run -in period.   
 
d  The secondary endpoint of changes in the weekly impact scores is based on the original EHP -30 pain impact 
 domain, i.e. the first 11 items. The additional work item is used only for validation.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  During the treatment period, subjects will self -insert the assign ed ring in the upper part of the 
vagina on RM+7 of cycle 1 to cycle 4 at the clinic by following standard instructions for use. 
Supervision by the site staff can be provided if needed. After insertion, the vaginal ring will be kept 
in the vagina continuous ly for one menstrual cycle until being replaced with the next ring on RM+7 
of the next cycle when the subject visits the clinic. Acceptability of the ring will be assessed by 
subjects via a ring acceptability questionnaire at each RM+7 visit during the tre atment period.  
Unless under other effective birth control permitted by protocol (section  4.3.2 ), subjects will be 
required to use a non -hormonal single -barrier co ntraception (i.e. condom) from wash -out (if 
applicable) or run -in to end -of-trial. Contraception counselling and condoms will be offered to 
subjects throughout the trial.  
B&B will be administer ed electronically  at randomization  and at cycle  4 (at visits 4  and 10), with 
trained trial coordinators completing the first part based on subjects’ verbal respo nses and 
investigators completing the second part based on findings of a pelvic examination . Subjects will 
complete the electronic  version of the EHP -30 questionnaire  at randomization , and at every  cycle 
from cycle 1 to cycle 4 (at visits 4, 6, 7, 8 and 1 0). PGIS  scale will be completed electronically by 
subjects a t cycle -2, at randomization  and a t cycle  4 (at visits 2, 4 and 1 0), whil e PGIC  scale wil l be 
completed electronically at cycle  4 (at visit 1 0). 
Blood samples will be collected throughout the trial for the purpose of evaluating mid-luteal phase 
endocrine parameters, bone turnover markers, endometriosis  biomarkers, quinagolide and 
metabolites, and routine safety laboratory parameters. In this trial, mid -luteal phase is defined as 
6-9 days after luteinizing  hormone (LH) surge (LH+6 -9) as tested by subjects at home by means of 
commercially a vailable urinar y LH kits . LH+7 visits can be scheduled on LH+6 -9, either based on 
an actual LH surge date as indicated by a positive LH surg e test or based on an estimated LH surge 
date according to subjects’ cycle length i f subjects  fail to detect the  LH surge. The exac t cycle day 
of the LH+7 visit will be derived based on the first menstrual bleeding date of the current cycle 
confirmed at the RM+7 visits. A n endocrine panel  including estradiol, progesterone, prolactin , TSH  
and IGF-1 will be assessed during  the mid -lutea l pha se of cycles  -1 and 4 (at visits 3  and 9). 
Evidence of ovulation  will be evaluated  by serum levels of mid -luteal progesterone . Fasting b lood 
samples for the analysis of  a bone formation marker  (s-PINP ) and a bone resorption marker  (s-CTx) 
will be collected during cycles  -1 and 4 (at visits 3 and 9). Blood samples for endometriosis 
biomarkers including , but not limited to , VEGF , PlGF, IL-6 and sFlt -1 will also be collect ed during 
cycles  -1 and 4 (at visits 3 and 9). At the same time points, if subjects have provided a separate 
informed consent, additional blood samples for potential analys es of circulating cell -free DNA  and 
microRNA will also be collected . Routine safety laboratory tests for clinical chemistry and 
hematology  parameters will b e performed during cycle  -1, at end -of-treatment  and end-of-trial (at 
visits 3, 10 and 1 1). Quinagolide and metabolites will be measured within 1 -5 days of first ring 
insertion, at RM+7 visits of cycles 1 , 3 and 4 as well as at LH+7 visit of cycle 4 (at visits 5, 6, 8, 9 
and 10) to assess systemic exposure and allow for population PK modelling . Blood samples should 
be taken prior to ring removal at RM+7 visits. If subjects have provided a separate informed 
consent, a blood sample for pharmacogenetic  analysis will also be collected at visit 5.

3.2 Planned Number of Trial Sites and Subjects  
It is planned to randomiz e 280 subjects from approximately 100 sites in North America . It is 
estimated that around  590 subjects  will be screened to randomiz e 280 subject s (70 subjects per 
treatment group ) to achieve 208 evaluable subjects at the end of treatment . The sample size will b e 
re-estimated by an external  statistician during an  interim analysis  and the number of randomiz ed 
subjects may be adjusted up to 3 60 (see section 9.1).  
 
3.3 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis with the option  to stop the trial early due to futility wil l be performed by an 
external  statistician , when approximately half of the planned evaluable subjects (104 subjects) have 
completed the treatment p eriod  of the trial for the assessment of the primary endpoint . The  
unblinded data  will be presented by treatment group . The futility bound is set at a conditional 
power using current trend equal to 5% , i.e. the trial could potentially be stopped for futility if  the 
probability of achieving a significant result in the highest remaining dose group is lower than 5% 
based on t he observed data at the interim  analysis . In case of high drop -out rate or discontinuations 
in the highest dose group, the analysis will be pe rformed on the remaining dose(s).

the time of interim analysis  unless otherwise notified . 
 
3.4 Clinical  Monitoring Committee  
An internal Clinical  Monitoring  Committee  consisting of the responsible medical officer, 
statistician  and clinica l trial manager  will be established. The Clinical Monitoring  Committee will 
meet regularly to evaluate the trial data including data with respect to the pre -defined stopping 
criteria (section 3.6.7 ). Data will be presented  in a blinded manner.  
 
3.5 Data Monitoring Committee   
An independent Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC ) consisting of exclusive ly external members 
will be established for this trial. The DMC members include external c linical experts , an external 
statistician and an ad hoc external cardiologist . None of the D MC memb ers will be involved in the 
conduct of the trial.  
The D MC will have access to  the unblinded interim data  presented by treatment group  and will 
recommend  whether the trial should be stopped or not according to t he pre-specified  futility criteria 
in the int erim analysis . The DMC will also recommend whether the sample size should be adjusted.  
If the stopping criteria on treatment group or trial level are met, t he DMC will be requested to  
access the unbli nded safety data presented by treatment group . The DMC  will recommend  whether 
one dose, several doses or the trial should be discontinued.  
In any case, the D MC will keep the data and analyses  confidential from any person s involved in the 
conduct of the trial. Sponsor representative (s) will only be allowed to attend the open session s of 
the DMC meeting s with no access to unblinded data . 
A trial -specific D MC charter will specify its members, responsibilities and its working procedures.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  3.6 Discussion of Overall Trial Design and Choice of Control Groups  
3.6.1 Trial Design  
The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy of three doses of quinagolide 
admi nistered as an extended -release vaginal ring compared to placebo on reduction of moderate to 
severe endometriosis -related pain.  
Strict criteria have been incorporated in the design of this dose-finding  trial to properly assess the 
treatment effect of quinagolide vaginal ring compared with placebo vaginal ring. In general, 
treatment and timing of ring insertion/removal a nd mid -luteal phase assessments according to 
individual menstrual cycle length , outcome measures consistent with gui delines for pain scorin g 
and with other  clinical trials on  endometriosis have to a great extent been incorporated in the design 
of this trial . 
This is a randomiz ed, double -blind trial  with placebo as the comparator to adequately evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of quinagolide vaginal ring. A placebo group is justified for this t rial as there is 
a need to account for the  placebo effect on pain relief  in order to measure  the absolute eff icacy of 
the active treatment.  In this trial, ethical concerns of using placebo controls  have been addressed by 
provid ing subjects with rescue analgesics  for pain relief  as needed . Furthermore, the provision of 
rescue analgesics can help prevent dropouts d ue to lack of efficacy.  
A run-in period of  at least two menstrual cycles  prior to randomiz ation will provide consistent and 
reliable baseline data o n pain scores for selecting subjects who truly experience moderate and 
severe endometriosis -related pain. Although a placebo run -in period has been widely used in 
clinical trials  with placebo response, it has been argued  that the  placebo run -in does not lower the 
placebo response, increase the drug -placebo difference or affect the drug response rate post -
random ization.29 This has been further demonstrated in a recent trial for endometriosis -related pain , 
where the placebo effect did not appear to be diminished by the inclusion of a 4 -week placebo  
run-in period.30  
The placebo -controlled treatment period in this trial  lasts for  four menst rual cycles , which 
approximately corresponds to the active treatment duration of 18 -20 weeks in the proof -of-concept 
study , where significant reductions in endometriosis lesions were  observed following oral 
administratio n of quinagolide up to 75 µg.16  
As described in section s 3.3 and 3.5, an interim analysis with the option  to stop the trial early due to 
futility is planned w hen approximately half of the planned evaluab le subjects have completed the 
treatment p eriod  of the trial . Should  the DMC recommend  to stop the trial early  due to futility, the 
subjects would not need to continue in a trial without any treatment benefit  so that an appropriate 
benefit/risk ratio for subjects participating in the trial  could be guaranteed .  
A double -blind design will ensure blinding and thereby unbiased evaluations by both the  
investigator  and the subject , particularly the latter, as the prim ary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
in this trial are based on the PRO  measures . Similarly, Ferring staff will also remain blinded to the

taken to ensure dou ble-blinding of the trial are described in detail in section 3.6.3 . A multi -center  
setting of the trial will guarantee that the required number of subjects can be recruited within a 
reasonable time and al so support subsequent  generalization  of the results.  
A non -hormonal single -barrier contracept ion method (i.e. condom) is required for subjects 
participating in the present  trial. Condom is the only feasible contraception method in this trial , as 
other contraception methods including hormonal contraceptive agent s and intrauterine devices can 
interfere with the assessment  of endometriosis -related pain . Throughout the trial, contraception 
counselling and condoms will be offered  to avoid occurrence of pregnancy during the trial. In 
addition, as a precautionary measure, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at least once per 
menstrual cycle  in the present trial . If the test result is positive  and confirmed by a serum βhCG 
test, the subject  will be discontinued from the trial  immediately . Quinagolide  is not a n embryotoxic 
or teratogenic agent. N o adverse effect s on embryo s or fetuses were observed in the reproductive 
toxicity studies in rats and rabbit s.11 Based on the available clinical data, exposure to quinagolide 
during earl y pregnancy has not been shown to increase the risk  of pregnancy losses  or congenital 
malformations compared with a normal pregnant population  (see section 1.3).  
All s ubjects  will be asked to continue the e-Diary recording during the fo llow-up period  of one 
menstrual cycle . Data collected from the follow -up period will help evaluate the maintenance  of the 
treatment effect.  
 
3.6.2 Selection of Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of the present trial is the c hange in the mean daily NRS  score  for the worst 
endometriosis -related  pain compared to placebo at cycle 4 . Endometri osis-related pain is  assessed 
as pain located in the abdominal -pelvic area and in the lower back area , which is the pain most 
often complained by  endometriosis patients . It is considered appropriate to use a single 
“endometriosis -related pain ” endpoint  as the primary endpoint in this  first trial investigating the 
efficacy of quinagolide in endometriosis patients.  The major concern for using a s ummed  score  
instead of two separate scores  with one each  for dysmenorrhea and  non-menstrual pelvic pain is 
that the treatment effect of some hormonal drugs is driven by amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, 
which can make a summed score unrepresentative of the true extent of improvement .31 However, 
quinagolide does not affect  ovarian function and thereby does not appear to modify the vaginal 
bleed ing pattern .11 It is therefore reasonable to believe that the treatment effect of quinagolide will 
not be driven by amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea and can be adequately measured by a single score 
for “endomet riosis -related pain” as the primary endpoint in the present trial.  
Subjects will be instructed to score  the endometriosis -related pain at its worst  during the preceding 
24 hours  every day before bedtime . Since pain assessment relies on memory, a sh ort reca ll period  
of 24 hours, a response based on the worst experience during the day and standardized  timing of 
assessment  every night  is usually preferable  and is in line with clinical experts’ and Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA )’s recommendations.32,33,34 By asking subjects about their worst

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  endometriosis -related pain  at the end of every day , the scoring has accounted for the worst pain 
occurring before any potential use of analgesics  and has ensured a consistent recall period of 24  
hours . Self-reporting of pain is considered to be  the gold standa rd of chronic pain assessment , 
because it reflect s the inherently subjective nature of pain .32 The validated 11 -point NRS widely 
used in clinical trials on chronic pain including endometriosis -related pain  is selected to quantify 
the pain intensity.30,31,32 
Based on wome n’s subjective impression of whether they have men strual bleeding or not, the daily 
NRS score on the worst endometriosis -related pain will be labelled  as “endometriosis -related pain 
on days with menstrual b leeding” (dysmenorrhea) or  “endometriosis -related pain on days with no 
menstrual  bleeding” (non -menstrual pelvic pain). Dysmenorrhea and non -menstrual pelvic pain will 
be evaluated separately as secondary endp oints together with dyspareunia, since these are the thr ee 
most common symptoms of endometriosis.  
In addition to endometriosis -related pain  intensity,  vaginal bleeding, occurrence of sex ual 
intercourse and dyspareunia, the use of rescue analgesic s will be c aptured in an e -Diary  as an 
objective measure of the pain relief.  
The impact of the endometriosis -relate d pain on different aspects of functioning will be self-
assessed both on a daily b asis and on a weekly basis.   
The B&B scale35 has been widely used in other endometriosis t rials and is selecte d for a secondary 
endpoint  in the present trial for validation of the newly developed endometriosis PRO (i.e. 
Women’s Endometriosis Diary) . Since endometriosis patients can also have a compromised  quality 
of life, a validated quality of life scale , EHP -30, developed specifically for endometriosis patients36 
will be administered to assess an y improvement in functioning  associated with treatment . PGIS as a 
static  measure of global improvement with tr eatment  and PGIC  as a dynamic measure of global 
improvement with treatment37 will both be assessed  in the present trial to help determine  the 
clinically important difference  from the patient s’ perspective and thereby establish an appropriate  
definition of responders  for future trials.   
Plasma concentration of quinagolide and the active metabolites (M1 and M2) will be assessed to 
allow estimation of p opulation PK  parameters and investigation of the exposure -response 
relationships for efficacy over a range o f doses to help select the dose (s) to be used in future  trials.  
In phase 1 trials, h igh levels of M1 and M2  were detected in some healthy women after intravaginal 
administration .11 No safety concerns are associated with high levels of metabolites . To investigate  a 
relationship between the gene profiles and presence of high levels of metabolites, DNA samples 
will be coll ected for polymorphism genotyping in the enzymes responsible for the elimination 
processes  of quinagolide  for those subjects who have provided a separate informed consent .  
Serum progesterone levels  will be assessed at mid -luteal phase of cycle 4, correspo nding to the end 
of treatment , to evaluate the impact of quinagolide on ovarian function . Other endocrine parameters 
include estradiol, prolactin , TSH  and IGF -1. Additional ly, to document that quinagolide does not 
have  hypoestrog enic side effects on bone metabolism , blood samples will also be collected for the

the recommended bone turnover  markers in clinical trials .38  
Safety  endpoint s include ECG  and echoc ardiography  to assess the cardiovascular risk profile of 
quinagolide, with special attention to drug-induced valvular heart disease. In order to detect any 
pathologic behavio rs potentially associated with  impulse control disorders during the use of 
dopamine receptor agonists , a modified  questionnaire for impulsive -compulsive disorders will be 
completed  at baseline and  at the end -of-treatment . Other safety endpoints cover adv erse events, ring 
acceptability,  routine safety laboratory parameters and urinalysis.  
 
3.6.3 Blinding  
The present tri al is double -blind. The subject, the investigator  and other trial staff at the site will be 
blinded to treatment allocation during the conduct of the trial. Blinding is achieved  by randomizing  
subjects in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to a vaginal ring containing quinagolide dose load 360 µg, 720 µg and  
1080  µg or placebo , all of whi ch are identical in appearance, flexibility and softness.  
Simila rly, the Ferring clinical team (e.g. data manager, statistician, clinical trial manager, clinical 
project leader, medical writer, pharmacovigilance physician, pharmacovigilance manager and 
medical officer ) will be blinded to treatment allocation until breaking of the blind. The blind wil l be 
broken when the trial database is declared clean and is released to the responsible statistician .  
As described in section 3.5, an external  DMC will have acc ess to unblinded interim data  presented 
by treatment group and, if needed, unblinded safety data of some subjects presented also by 
treatment group. In any case, the D MC will keep the data and analyses  confidential from the 
Ferring clinical team.  
Since the primary endpoint and the secondary efficacy endpoints in this trial are based on PRO  
measures, precaution must be taken to  ensure the blinding of subjects to treatment allocation 
throughout the trial. To avoid potential speculation of treatment allocation  by comparing current 
pain scores against previous scores , subjects are not given any access to historically reported  data 
after having submitted their answer s in the e -Diary . Investigators , trial site staff and Ferring  clinical 
team will also be blinded to the results of some laboratory parameters potentially linked to 
quinagolide’s mechanism of action. In addition, all subjects will be asked at the end  of treatment  
which treatment (quinagolide or placebo) they b elieve they have received  to evaluate the risk of 
inadvertent unblinding.  These  practices are  in line with FDA PRO guida nce.33  
 
3.6.4 Selection of Doses in the  Trial  
In a dose -response trial it is desirable to test a relative ly wide span of doses to identify  the most 
appropriate dose (s) for future trials. The dose selection should also ensure that it is possible to 
discern clinically meaningful differences within a span that is acceptable with respect to subject 
safety.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Selection of doses in this trial is based on safety, tolerability and PK obtained fr om phase 1 trials. 
Oral administration of quinagolide at doses up to 75 µg once daily  for 18 -20 weeks appear ed to 
reduce the size of lesions in endometriosis patients .16 In the first phase 1 trial (000076), a fter 
repeated oral administration of 75 µg quina golide tablets once daily for 5  days, the mean C max was 
8 pg/mL, the steady -state trough level was 0.8 pg/mL, and AUC tau was 42.3 h*pg/mL. The 
corresponding values after intravaginal administration of 75 µg  tablets was 13  pg/m L, 7 pg/mL and 
225 h*pg/mL, respectively, which was 1.6-fold, 8-fold and 5 -fold higher than after oral 
administration , demonstrat ing that intravaginal administration circumvents the first pass 
metabolism. It also showed that intravaginal administration had  a slow  absorption with 
approximately 8  hours to reach the maximum concentration compared with oral administration 
(Tmax about 1 hour). Although intravaginal administration of quinagolide tablet s up to 75 µg  was 
associated with higher exposure,  it was well tolerated with lower incidences of treatment -related 
adverse events , compared with oral administration.   
In the subsequent trial (000155 ), quinagolide vaginal ring at a targe t release rate of quinagolide 
4.5 µg/day, 9 µg/day and 13 .5 µg/day were investigated. The plasma concentration of quinagolide 
increased initially in approximate proportionality . Following the initial peak, the plasma 
concentration declined slowly over the treatment period and the trough leve ls were maintained 
between 1 -10 pg/mL for all three doses for up to 35 days. The me dian T max following 
administration of quinagolide vaginal rings was approximately  36-48 hours for all three  doses.   
Selection of the doses in the present trial is b ased on the PK  profiles obtained from the se two 
phase  1 trials , which are illustrated in  Figure 3-2 show ing the mean observed PK  parameters of the 
75 µg oral and i ntravaginal tablets during a daily dosing interval extended to 28 days,  compared to 
the PK  profiles of quinagolide vaginal rings  administered  for 28 days . For t he highest dose of 
quinagolide vaginal ring , the mean C max of 10.9  pg/mL does not exceed the mea n C max of 13  pg/mL 
observed with the 75  µg intravaginal tablet . Following the initial peak, the concentration is similar 
to the mean C max of 8 pg/mL observed with the 75  µg oral tablet. For the lowest dose of quinagol ide 
vaginal ring, the mean concent ration of quinagolide at day 28 resembles  the steady stat e trough of 
0.8 pg/mL observed with the  75 µg oral tablet.  Therefore , for the three proposed  doses of 
quinagolide vagi nal ring , the maximum concentrations are below  the maximum concentration o f 
the 75 µg intravaginal tablet and the concentrations after the initial peak are within the 
concentration range of the  75 µg oral tablet.

release rate  difference of 4.5 µg/day) to investigate the treatment effect of quinagolide . The 
outcome of the present trial should allow subsequent examination of the dose -response curve an d to 
identify the dose(s)  for quinagolide vaginal ring to be used in future trials.   
The doses for the rescue analgesic medication s used during this trial are in line with the 
recommendations in the respective product’ labelling for  the indication of pain relief.  
 
3.6.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
In this clinical trial, the duration of treatment is  based on individual subject’s menstr ual cycle 
length rather than calendar time points, matching the visits and timings of evaluation with the 
replacement of the vaginal ring. A menstrual cycle is considered the period between day 7 of return 
of menses (RM+7) in a cycle until the following da y 7 of return of menses of the next cycle.  Visits 
on RM+7 can be scheduled  day 6 to day 10 day of return of menses (RM+6 -10). 
Subjects will be instructed to insert the assigned ring in the upper part of the vagina at RM+7 visits , 
a timing that corresponds to the  stop of menstrual bleeding and  is convenient for administ ration of a 
vaginal product, which can therefore easily be remembered and followed by subjects.  The vaginal 
ring will be kept in the vagina continuously for one menstrual cycle unt il being r eplaced by the next

sufficient time to inhibit  the endometriotic lesions  prior to  return  of the menses  in the next cycle , 
when the majority  of the most severe endometriosis -related pain occurs.   
 
3.6.6 Selection of the Trial Population  
The trial population consists of  surgically confirmed  endometriosis patients  commonly included in 
clinical trials . After surgical treatment of endometriosis, these subjects still have  recurrence of 
symptoms and moderate to severe endometriosis -related pain . Confirmation of endometriosis by 
laparoscopy or laparotomy is considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosi s of the disease.39 It 
is increasingly recognized that ultrasound evidence of endometrioma , combined with recurrent 
endometriosis -related pain , is a useful clinical diagnos tic measure  of endometriosis  and can identify 
endometriosis  with high accuracy.40,41,42   
Moderate to severe endometriosis pain for this trial is defined as  having a mean daily NRS score of 
≥4 for the worst endometriosis -related  pain during each run -in menstrual cycle. The cut -off of 4 is 
the most commonly recommended lower limit for moderate pain  on NRS . Results of s ome other 
endometriosis studie s were also taken into consideration  in choosing this  cut-off. In two recently 
comple ted pivotal phase 3 trials among  1689  endometriosis patients, a mean daily NRS score of  
approximately 5.5 was recorded for endometriosis pain  at its worst during a baseline period of 35 
days.43 In an observational study  for a minimum of 12 weeks , the 268 subjects  reported  a mean 
daily NRS score of 3.61 for endometriosis -related pain  at its worst  as well as  a daily NRS score of 
≥7 for at least 4 days.44  
The trial will include pre -menopausal women ≥18 years without an upper age limit and  will thereby 
cover the age span of most endometriosis patients.  
The exclusion criteria incorporate the contraindications for the use of dopamin e agonists and rescue 
analg esics . 
 
3.6.7 Discontinuation Criteria  (Stopping and Withdrawal Criteria)  
The discontinuation criteria consist of criteria for disc ontinuation from treatment ( stopping criteria ) 
and criteria for discontinuation from trial ( withdrawal criteria ). For any premature  discontinuation, 
an end -of-treatment visit (section  6.4.6 ) should be scheduled as soon as possible (preferably within 
7 days of the last ring removal ) and the investigator will obtain all the required details and 
document the date and the main reason  of premature discontinuation  in the electronic case report 
form ( e-CRF ).

spontaneous recovery ) incompatible with continuing treatment  
• Treatment -related alteration in consciousness or mental sta tus (such as confusion, amnesia, 
loss of alertness and disorientation)  incompatible with continuing treatment  
• Treatment -related pathological behaviors of impulse control disorders including 
pathological gambling, compulsive buying, binge eating, and hypersexuality  (see section 
7.2.2.10 ) incompatible with continuing treatment  
• Treatment -related acute p sychosis, e.g. hallucinations/delu sion 
 
Stopping Criteria  on Trial Level   
The DMC will consider the following  SAEs for stopping or modifying the trial (i.e. discontinuing 
one dose, several doses or the trial):  
• One subject discontinued due to  a diagnosis of  cardiac valvulopathy  confirmed by an 
independent cardiologist (see section 7.2.2.9 ) 
• More than three subjects discontinued due to treatment -related syncope (orthostatic collapse 
associated with an abrupt, transient, complete loss of consciousness and inability to 
maintain postural tone, with rapid and spontaneous recovery)  
• More than thre e subjects discontinued due to treatment -related  significant alteration in 
consciousness or mental status (such as confusion, amnesia, loss of  alertness and 
disorientation)  
The DMC will be requested to access the unblinded safety data presented by treatment group and 
will recommend  whether  one dose , several doses  or the trial  should be discontinued  based on the 
results of the analysis .

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  5 TREATMENTS  
5.1 Treatments Administered  
5.1.1 Investigational Medicinal Product s (IMP s) 
The in vestigational medicinal product s (IMP s) in the present trial  will be supplie d as vaginal rings 
containing quinagolide 360 µg, 720  µg, 1080  µg or its matching placebo.  Quinagolide vaginal ring 
is a vaginal delivery system which allows for the extended release of quinagolide for up to 35 days. 
The three strengths of quinagolide vaginal rings investigated in the present trial have a  target  
release rate of  quinagolide 4.5 µg/day, 9 µg/day and 13 .5 µg/day, respectively . Quinagolide or 
placebo  vaginal ring is inserted on RM+ 6-10 of a cycle and is kept in the vagina continuously until 
being replaced by a new ring on RM+ 6-10 of the next cycle.   
On RM+7 of cycle -1 (at visit 4) , eligible subjects will be randomiz ed in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 
quinagolide vaginal ring dose load 36 0 µg, qui nagolide vaginal ring dose load 72 0 µg, quinagolide 
vaginal ring dose load 108 0 µg or placebo vaginal ring, administered once per menstr ual cycle and 
sequentially for four  menstrual cycles (cycles 1, 2, 3 and 4).  
The vaginal ring will be inserted and removed by the subject herself  at the  RM+7 visits to  clinic by 
following the standard instruction s for use provided to each su bject , irrespective of w hether the 
subject is still experiencing menstrual bleeding . If needed, supervision by  site staff c an be provided  
and the lubricant allowed for this trial (i.e. KY Jelly) can be used . If the ring is expelled , it can be 
rinsed and re -inserted by the subject  at home. In case the ring is expelled  during the non -menstrual 
period  but is impossible to re-insert , a visit to the clinic for ri ng replacement must be arranged as 
soon as possible and no later than  3 days after  ring expulsion . If the ring is expelled du ring the 
menstrual  period and is impossible to re -insert , it is up to the investigator to decide whether a 
replacement ring is needed or not.  Subjects are recommended not to take out the ring for sexual 
intercourse.  If a ring is out of the body for more than 24 hours, subjects should not re -insert the ring 
but contact the site for ring replacement.  
 
5.1.2 Non-Investigational Medicinal Product (NIMP)  
The non -investigational medicinal product (NIMP) in the present trial is 200 mg  film-coated, 
capsule -shaped ibuprofen tablets  with the trade name MOTRIN  IB, which is provided by Ferring as 
mild r escue analgesics to subjects  from start of run-in to the end -of-trial. Subjects are allowed to 
take ibuprofen for their pain relief on an as -needed basis but the maximum  amount is 800 mg 
(4 tablets) per dose and 3200 mg  (16 tablets) per day .27 The specific dosing regimen will be decided  
by the investigator in accordance with the labelling of prescription ibuprofen  doses .27  
If required, a strong rescue analgesic hydrocodone -acetaminophen  may be prescribed by the  
investigator  but this will not be provided by Ferring and is not a NIMP . Details are specified in

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  5.5 Blinding / Unblinding  
5.5.1 Blinding  
Quinagolide and placebo vaginal rings, including replacement rings,  will be packaged in 
accordance with  a computer -generated randomization  list prepared for all trial sites.  
All packaged IMP kits will be indistinguishable with identical appearance  and will be labelled with 
random identification  numbers which are linked to the  treatment allocation . Once the  subject is 
assigned a unique randomization  number in the e -CRF system , the subject’ s treatment allocation 
will be  transferred automatically to the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system. S ite sta ff 
will access the IRT system to obt ain an identification number for  the vaginal ring to dispense to the 
subject , with both the site staff and the subject blinded  to the treatment allocation. In case of ring 
replacement , the identification number for the replace ment  ring will also be obtained from the IRT 
system. All vaginal ring s will be indistinguishable with identical appearance, flexibility  and 
softness . Subjects, investigators and other site staff  as well as  in-field monitors will be blinded to 
treatment allocation throughout the trial.  
The personnel at the central laboratory analyzing  blood samples for  quinagolide and metabolite  
concentration  will be unblinded to treatment allocation , but the personnel at the other central 
laboratory analyzing  blood samples will be blinded to treatment allocation throughout the trial.  As 
described in section 3.5, an external  DMC will have acc ess to unblinded interim data  presented by 
treatment group  and, if needed, unblinded safety data of some subjects presented also by treatment 
group. In any case, the D MC will keep the data and analyses  confidential from  the Ferring clinical 
team.  Ferring clinical team e.g. data manager, statistician , trial manager, clinical project  leader, 
medical writer, pharmacovigilance physician, pharmaco vigilance manager and medical officer will 
be blinded to treatment allocation until breaking of the blind. The blind will be broken when the  
trial database is declared clean and is released to the responsible statistician .  
The randomization  list will not be available to any person involved in the conduct and evaluation of 
the trial until the trial database is declared clean and is released to  the responsible statistician , 
except fo r the release to the external  statistician for the interim analysis . Likewise, the treatment 
allocation information will not be accessible to investigators, trial staff at the site or central 
laborato ry personnel dur ing the trial.  
 
5.5.2 Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment   
An emergency unblinding procedure  will be available to the investigator and designated persons at 
Ferring  through the e -CRF . It is the investigator’s responsibility to decide whether it is medical ly 
necessary to know the investigational product the subject receives (i.e. unblinding) to ensure the 
subject’s welfare and safety , and thereby the responsibility to break the blind for in dividual subjects 
in emergency situations resides with the investigator . Breaking of the blind for individual subjects 
in emergency situations could be required  in case of a suspected unexpected serious adverse

question is required for therapeutic decisions for the management of the subject.  
The investigator/person  who unblinds a subject’s treatment will use the e-CRF  in which he/she is 
required to enter a password and record the reason for unblinding before the treatment c ode can be 
broken.  The e-CRF  automatically records when and by whom  the code is broken . The investigator 
must record the event of unblinding in the subject’s medical record, including the reason for 
unblinding, but not the treatment all ocation if this can be avoided.  The investigator should notify 
the IRB about the circumstances for unblinding in accordance with local requirements.  
In case of accidental unblinding , the same procedure as for emergency unblinding must be 
followed, i.e. the person who i s acci dentally unblinded will enter a password in the e -CRF and must 
recor d the reason for unblinding, while the e -CRF records when  and by wh om the code i s broken.  
If Ferr ing needs to unblind a subject ’s treatment , the e -CRF will be used for unblinding. It is 
required to enter a password and the reason for unblinding before the treatment code can be broken. 
The e -CRF records a lso when and by whom the code i s broken. The code break will occur 
according to corporate standard operating  procedures for unplanned unblinding of trial subjects . It 
may be necessary to unblind an individual subject’s treatment for the purpos es of  expedited 
reporting to the relevant health  authorities  and/or I RBs. In that situation, every effor t will be made 
to maintain blinding of sponsor personnel involved in data analysis and interpretation. Other 
personnel may be unblinded for SUSARs, including trial site staff as well as staff acting on behalf 
of Ferring.  
Information on whether the blind ha s been broken for any subjects is available in the e -CRF and 
must be collected before the database is declared clean and is released to the responsible 
statistician.  
In case the e -CRF cannot be accessed and hence the emergency unblinding cannot be performe d 
within the e -CRF system, the investigato r should contact Ferring Pharmacovigilance using the 
contact details given below .

If Ferring Pharmacovigilance cannot access the e -CRF, a b ack-up procedure involving the e -CRF 
vendor is in place.   
 
5.6 Treatment Compliance  
5.6.1 Dispensing and Accountability  
The IMP must  only be dispensed to and inserted by subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and 
are randomiz ed to a treatment group in the trial. The site staff will use an IRT system to assign and 
dispense IMP and NIMP kits.  The dates  and quantities  of IMP and NIMP dispensed  to and returned

b Pain impact will be assessed by subjects in e -Diary on both a daily and  a weekly basis.  
 
6.1 Activities between Clinic Visits  
In this trial, a  menstrual cycle is considered the period between day 7 of return of menses (RM+7) 
in a cycle u ntil the following RM+7. Visits on RM+7 can be scheduled on RM+6 -10, i.e. day 6 to 
day 10 of return of menses.  Similarly, visits on LH+7 can be scheduled on LH+6 -9, i.e. 6 -9 days 
after LH surge, which is either assessed by the subject using LH surge kits at home or estimated by 
the si te staff based on subject’s  cycle  length . If subjects do not have menstrual bleeding in a cycle  
during the treatment  and follow -up period , the RM+7 visit in that cycle must be arranged within 
35 days of the last RM+7 visit.  
The review of the e -Diary, which covers compliance with e -Diary completion  and analgesic use 
should be performed by site staff regularly between clinic visits.  
Contraception counselling and condoms will be offered to subjects as needed throughout  the trial . 
 
6.1.1 Premature Discontinuation  
In case of premature discontinuation, an end -of-treatment visit ( see section 6.4.6 ) should  be 
arranged as soon as possible (preferably within 7  days of the last ring removal ). Subjects who are 
prematurely discontinued from the treatment  due to adverse events will be asked to  attend  an end-
of-trial visit (see  section 6.5.1 ) within 2 weeks of t he end-of-treatment visit. If subjects are 
discontinued for other reasons, the end -of-treatment and end -of-trial visits can coincide .  
If a discontinued subject is  found with an ongoing adverse e vent classified as serious or considered 
to have a reasonable p ossible causality to the IMP at their last trial visit, the  site staff should follow  
up until the event is resolved (see section 8.6).

Potential participants will be scheduled to come to the clinic for the screening assessments.  The 
screening period includes a wash -out period of approximately one month  (only applicable to 
subjects currently using some hormonal product s such as contraceptives c) and a run -in period of 
two complete menstrual cycles (cycles -2 and -1, applicable to all subjects).   
In case of technical issues at the start  of the run -in period, subjects are allowed to re -start cycle -2 
after undergoi ng all procedures at visit 2 except for PGIS and LH surge test reminde rs. Subjects 
that screen fail du e to the temporary trial hold du ring the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) 
pandemic may be re -screened. In this case,  subjects need to repeat the two run -in cycles , but can be 
waived from the echocardiography assessment  as applicable .  
 
6.2.1 Wash -out Period  (As Applicable)  
Subjects who are currently using some hormonal product s (including GnRH antagonists, aro matase 
inhibitors, danazol and hormonal contraceptives such as combined oral contraceptive pill, 
progestin -only pill, transdermal patch and contraceptive ring)  may be e ligible for the trial if they 
have completed the wash -out period . In this case, subjects need to sign the informed consent (s) 
before the y discontinue those product s. Discontinuation of the product s should fol low the labelling 
(e.g. completing the  current c ycle of contrac eptives before wash -out).  
Subjects requiring wash -out will not be provided with e -Diary or  rescue analgesics until the 
completion of  the wash -out period, i.e. at  the run -in visit.  
The following must take place if a wash -out period is required:  
• Signed and dated written informed consent (s)  
- Mandatory for the informed consent covering the participation of the trial  [note: this 
must be obtained prior to any trial -related procedures]  
- Optional for the informed co nsent covering the cell-free DNA/ micro RNA  and

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  The additional work item (Question 12 in Figure 7-2) will only be used for validation of the weekly 
e-Diary. The secondary endpoint of changes in the weekly pain imp act scores will be based on the 
original EHP -30 pain impact domain, i.e. the first 11 items. The mean of the weekly pain impact 
scores during the two run -in menstrual cycles (cycles -2 and -1) will be considered baseline.  
 
7.2.1.4  Vaginal Bleeding Pattern  
Subjects will register their  vaginal bleeding pattern in the e -Diary every day from run-in to follow -
up (cycle -2 to cycle 5). Subjects will first be asked if they have had any vaginal bleeding ( “yes” or 
“no”) during the past 24 hours. In case of any vagin al bleeding, subjects need to assess their 
bleeding volume as spotting (tiny amount of blood on underwear or panty liner s), light bleeding 
(requiring 1 -3 sanitary pads or tampons per day), moderate bleeding (requiring 4 -6 sanitary pads or 
tampons per day) or heavy bleeding (requiring more than 6 sanitary pads or tampons per day). In 
addition, they need  to indicate whether their bleeding is menstrual bleeding or not.  
The questions to be answered are  
9. Did you have vaginal bleeding in the past 24 hours?   
 No   
 Yes 
   
If the subject had vaginal bleeding in the past 24 hours:  
10. Please describe your bleeding in the past 24 hours.  
 Spotting (tiny amount of blood on underwear or panty liners)  
 Ligh t (requiring 1-3 sanitary pads or tampons per day ) 
 Moderate  (requiring 4 -6 sanitary pads or tampons per day ) 
 Heavy (requiring more than 6 sanitary pads or tampons per day ) 
 
11. Was your bleeding related to your period (i.e., menstrual bleeding)?  
 No  
 Yes 
 
Vaginal bleeding pattern is evaluated as the number of no bleeding, spotting, light bleeding, 
moderate bleeding and hea vy bleeding days , the duration of menstrual and non -menstrual period, 
and the number of bleeding days during the non -menstrual period.  The vaginal bleeding pattern  
during  the two run-in menstrual cycles  (cycles -2 and -1) will be considered baseline .  
 
7.2.1.5  Analgesic Use  
Rescue analgesics for endometriosis -related  pain will be limited to ibuprofen and/or hydrocodone -
acetaminophen in this trial. As a mild analgesic, ibuprofen will be provided in the form of 200 mg 
oral tablets  to subjects for their use on an as -needed basis. The specific dosing regimen of ibuprofen 
will be advised by the investigator but the maximum amount is 800 mg (4 tablets) per dose and 
3200 mg (16 tablets) per day  in accordance with the label of prescription ibuprofen doses .27

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  Subjects will be instructed not to use other analgesics  unless necessary . If there is a need to change 
analgesic s, subjects should discuss with investigators, who may  prescribe a strong resc ue analgesic  
hydrocodone -acetaminophen  at a dose of 5 mg hydrocodone plus 300 mg or 325  mg 
acetaminophen . Only oral tablet form ulation  of combined hydrocodone -acetaminophen  (i.e. 
hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen ) is allowed in the present trial. The sp ecific dosing regimen 
of hydrocodone -acetaminophen  is decided by the investigator based on s ubjects’ needs and 
tolerability in accordance with the labelling of the product.  
After  subjects ’ entry into  the run-in period , investigators can either advise  ibuprofen dosing 
regimen or prescribe hydrocodone -acetaminophen by taking subjects’ preference and history of 
analgesic use into consideration. I nvestigators should not take the initiative to suggest any 
modifications  to the subject’s current rescue  analgesic regimen.  
Subjects will be asked to follow the investigators’ instructions on the type (s) and dose (s) of rescue 
analgesics they can use and whether they can take different rescue analgesics at the same time. Use 
of any  other analgesics  for endom etriosis -related pain  is prohibited from the start of run -in to the 
end-of-trial (see section 4.3.1  for prohibited analgesics) . Any prophylactic use of analgesics  is also

7.2.2 Assessments Related to Secondary Endpoints at Clinic Visits  
7.2.2.1  Biberoglu and Behrman (B&B) Scale  
B&B scale is a widely used  scale for endometriosis that consist s of two parts, with the first part 
evaluating symptoms of endometriosis (i.e. different types of endometriosis pain)  and the second 
part evaluating signs of endometriosis ( see Appendix 1 ). It is available in English, but a  Spanish 
translat ion can be administered if preferr ed by the subject .  
The first part of B&B should be completed by trained  trial coordinator s based on subjects ’ verbal 
responses. In the first part, the subject  will be asked to  grade her pelvic pain (item A), 
dysmenorrhea (item B) and dyspareunia (item C) during the last menstrual cycle as none, mild, 
moderate or severe, corresponding to a score of 0 -3. The criteria for b eing mild, moderate or severe 
are defined differently for each item. The total pelvic pain score is the sum of the three scores, i.e. 
A+B+C .

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  In the second part, the investigator should grade the subject’s pelvic tenderness (item D) and 
induration (item E)  based on findings from a pelvic  examination as none, mild, moderate or severe, 
corresponding to a score of 0 -3. Efforts should be made to ensure this assessment is performed by 
the same investigator for the same subject throughout the trial. The criteria fo r being mild, moderate 
or severe are  defined differently for each item. The total physical sign pain score is the sum of the 
two scores, i.e. D+E. The total symptom and sign severity score is the sum of all five scores, i.e. 
A+B+C+D+E.  
The trial coordinat or and the investigator will be provided with diff erent access codes to access 
separate parts of the  B&B scale on an electronic tablet . To avoid bias  in the assessment , the trial 
coordinator  will only be able to access the first part of the  scale for scoring while the investigator 
will only be able to access the second part of the scale . It is not allowed to have the same person 
administering both parts of the scale. In addition, the B&B scale  should  be completed 
independently from  subjects’  scorings in the e -Diary  in this trial .  
B&B will be administered at randomization  and at cycle  4 (at visits 4  and 10). The first part of the 
B&B  should always be completed before  ring inserti on / removal at both visits  and also prior to 
non-PRO procedures  at cycle  4. The scores obtained at randomization  will be used as baseline.   
 
7.2.2.2  Endometriosis Health Profile -30 (EHP -30) Questionnaire  
The EHP -30 is a quality -of-life questionnaire validated in both English and Spanish for 
endometriosis patients. Subjects will complete the core part of the EHP -30 questionnaire consisting 
of 30 questions measur ing the frequency of the endometriosis impact on their quality of life during 
the past 4 weeks, with five options  of never, rarely, sometimes, often and always  (see Appendix  1).  
An electronic  version of the EHP -30 will be completed by the subject prior to ring insertion at 
randomization , and prior to  other non-PRO procedures at every  cycle from cycle 1 to cycle 4 (at 
visits 4,  6, 7, 8 and 1 0).  
The scores obtained at randomization  (at visit  4) will be used as baseline .  
 
7.2.2.3  Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) Scale  
PGIS is a static measure of the global treatment benefits from the patients’ perspective. Subject s 
will be asked to evaluate endometriosis -related pain during the last menstrual cycle, during the  
menstrual bleeding days of the last menstrual cycle and duri ng the  non-menstrual -bleeding days of 
the last menstrual cycle . In addition, subjects will be asked to evaluate the impact of endometriosis -
related pain on daily activities  during the last menstrual cycle,  during the  menstrual bleeding days 
of the last menstrual cycle and during the  non-menstrual -bleeding days of the last menstrual cycle. 
The scale is presented in Appendix 1.  Subject s will complete the PGIS scale electronically at the 
site at cycle -2, prior to  ring insertion at randomization  and prior  to other non-PRO  procedures at 
cycle  4 (at visits 2, 4 and 1 0).

7.2.2.4  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale  
PGIC is a dynamic measure of the global treatment benefits from the patients’ perspective. Subject s 
will be asked to evaluate change in endometriosis -related pain, change in dysmenorrhea and change 
of non -menstrual pelvic pain since initiation of treatment. In addition, subject s will also evaluate 
the change in the overall impact of endometriosis -related pain on daily activities, the change in 
endometrios is-related pain impact during their menstrual periods and change in the endometriosis -
related pain impact during non -menstrual periods since initiation of treatment. The scale is 
presented in Appendix 1.  Subject s will complete t he PGIC scale  electronically  at the site prior to 
other non-PRO procedures at cycle  4 (at visit 1 0).  
 
7.2.2.5  Plasma Concentration of Quinagolide and Metabolites  
Blood samples for measurement of plasma concentration of quinagolide and its metabolites M1 and 
M2 will be collecte d within 1 -5 days of first ring insertion, at RM+7 visits of cycles 1, 3 and 4 as 
well as at LH+7 visit of cycle  4 (at visits 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10). Bloo d sample s should be taken prior to 
removal of the ring at RM+7 visits. The a nalysis of plasma concentration of quinagolide  and its 
metabolites will be performed by means of a validated tandem mass spectrometry method .  
   
7.2.2.6  Mid-luteal Phase Endocrine Parameters and Ovarian Function  
Blood samples for the analysis of endocrine paramet ers, consisting of estradiol, progesterone, 
prolactin, TSH and IGF -1, will be collected during mid -luteal phase (i.e. LH+7) of cycles -1 and 4 
(at visits 3  and 9). The proportion of subjects  with serum levels of mid-lutea l progesterone  
≥25 nmol/L  (7.9 ng/m L) will be calculated as  evidence of ovulation .  
The samples will be analyzed  at a central laboratory. The investigator will review and evaluate the 
laboratory results . However, the results of progesterone, prolactin, TSH and IGF -1 after 
randomization  will be blinded to investigators, site staff and Ferring clinical team . The laboratory

7.2.2.8  Electrocardiography (ECG)  
The 12 -lead ECG will be recorded within  cycle -1 and at cycle  4 (around  visits 3 and 1 0). ECG at 
screening  can be performed anytime during cycle -1, e.g. at LH+7 visit (visit 3)  but results must be 
available before randomization . The report must be reviewed, signed and dated by the investigator 
before randomization . Results at randomization  will be used as baseline. ECG at cycle 4 can be 
performed within ±2  weeks of visit 10. ECG wil l be recorded with a calibrated ECG device after 
the subject has been in supine position for at least 5  minutes.  ECG must be performed before blood 
sampling when applicable.  
The parameters to be assessed are heart rate, PR interval, RR interval, QRS interval, QT interval 
and QTcF interval  (i.e. QT correction according to the Fridericia ’s formula QTcF= QT/RR0.33). 
ECG recordings will capture at least four QRS complexes, i.e. 3 evaluable RR intervals. All ECG 
recordings will be sent to a central cardiac  laboratory for evaluation  as normal or abnormal . If the 
results of central reading  are abnormal , the investigator will evaluate whether th e abnormal finding 
is clinically significant  or not . Any occurrence of de - or re-polarization  disorders  (QT 
prolongat ion), arrhythmic disorders or other abnormalities will be assessed in comparison to the  
baseline .  
ECG may be repeated for quality reasons and in this case the repeat ed assessment  will be used for 
analysis. If subject demonstrates a prolongation of QTc int erval ≥500 msec  or a QTc interval 
change from baseline ≥60 msec , two additi onal ECG  assessment s should be acquired 2 -5 minutes 
apart  and all three ECG assessments should be re -evaluated by the central cardiac laboratory . If the 
averaged va lues from three c onsecutive ECG assessments indicate  a prolongation of QTcF interval 
≥500 msec  or a QTcF interval change from baseline ≥60 msec  as confirmed by the central cardiac 
laboratory , the subject should be discontinued from the treatment (see section 3.6.7 ). 
 
7.2.2.9  Echocardiography   
Echocardiography  will be performed within cycle -1 and at cycle 4  (around visits 3  and 1 0). 
Echocardiography  at screening can be arranged anytime during cycle -1, e.g. at LH+7 visit (visit 3) 
but results must be available prior to randomization . The report must be reviewed, signed and dated 
by the investigator before  randomization . Echocardiogr aphy  at cycle 4 can be perfor med within 
±2 weeks of visit 1 0. 
The 2-dimensional (2D) echocardiography and Doppler echocardiography  will be used for 
assessment of valvular structure and function with a calibrated echocardiography device. For the 
same subjec t, all echocardiography  assessments in this trial should be performed by t he sa me type 
of echocardiography  device at the same center .

aortic and pulmonary valves will be assessed semi -qualitatively by 2D echocardiography. Valvular 
regurgitation will be assessed by Doppler echocardiography. All echocardiography  video clips at 
each visit will be sent t o a central cardiac laboratory and stored for potential further evaluation. 
Assessment performed prior to randomization  will be used as baseline and will be compared against 
assessment s performed at cycle 4.  
The echocardiography  technician s and board -certified cardiologist s from the central cardiac 
laboratory will evaluate each assessment as normal or abnormal according to American College of 
Cardiology /  American Heart Association guidelines for valvular heart disease . If abnormal, the 
level of valvular re gurgitation and valvular stenosis will be specified as mild, moderate or severe 
and valvular structure  will be evaluated as well. Criteria are provided in a separate manual.  
At cycle 4, any changes from baseline will be assessed by the primary cardiologis t(s) at the central 
cardiac laboratory as significant or not significant. In case of significant change from baseline, 
irrespective of the change level, the echocardiogram  will be re -evaluated and confirmed by a 
secondary cardiologist at the central cardia c laboratory. The degree of change in  valve stenosis or 
regurgitation will be confirmed by quantitative analysis of gradients and valve area for stenotic 
lesions and by vena contracta width, jet area, and Doppler waveforms for regurgitant lesions. If the 
change is confirmed  to be significant by the secondary cardiologist , the finding should be reported 
to the investigator who should evaluate the clinical significance of the finding in relation with 
clinical symptoms and other te sts (e.g. ECG and vital signs ). The subject will be discontinued  from 
the treatment (see section 3.6.7 ) and will be  referred to a cardiologist for further follow -up. A 
repeated echocardi ography  will be required and all video clips saved previously for the 
discontinued subject will be further eva luated by an external  cardiologist  for an independent  
evaluation  of the findings  and for a potential  diagnosis of cardiac valvulopathy . 
 
7.2.2.10  Impulse C ontrol Disorder  
A questionnaire  adapted from a validated Questionnaire for Impulsive -Compulsive Disorders in 
Parkinson’s Disease -Rating Scale45 will be used to monitor any significant sign s of pathological 
behaviors  associated with impulse control disorder during the trial. The questionnaire has four 
primary questions concerning thoughts, urges/desires, behavior  controls and engagement , each of 
which is applied to various behaviors  associated with  impulse control diso rders , i.e. gambling,  sex, 
buying, eating, performing tasks or hobbies, repeating simple activities  and medication use. 
However, the original sub-question on medication  use is not appropriate for this trial, as it focuses 
on the medication use d for Parkins on’s disease . Therefore this sub-question  “taking your 
Parkinson’s disease medications” has been  deleted  (see A ppendix  1). The questionnaire use s a 
5-point Likert scale (score 0 -4) to measure the  frequency  of behaviors  (never, rarely, sometimes, 
often and very often) .

associated with impulse control disorders . The behavior  identified  will be reported as an adverse 
event. In addition, if this is considered to be  treatment -related  by the investigator , the subject will 
be discontinued from the tr eatment  (see section 3.6.7 ) and, if needed,  will be referred to psychiatric 
counselling and will be followed up  until symptoms are resolved . 
 
7.2.2.11  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be recorded from the signing of  informe d consent (s) for participation in the 
trial until the end -of-trial visit. For each adverse ev ent, the following parameters will be  recorded 
by the investigator on the Adverse Event Log: description of event, date and time of onset, 
intensity, causal relati on to IMP, action taken to IMP, other actions taken, seriousn ess of the 
adverse event, date and time of outcome, and outcome. A search for predefined preferred terms and 
reported terms  will be conducted on all treatment -emergent adverse events to identify those 
potentially related t o behaviors  associated with impulse control disorders . See section 8.

time she has inserted and/or removed the ring at the clinic on RM+7 of cycle -1 to cycle 4 (at visits 
4, 6, 7, 8 and 1 0).  
At randomization  (visit 4), a simplified version of the questionnaire with only one question about 
ring insertion (see Appendix 1) will be completed by the subject.   
At RM+7 visits of cycle 1 to cycle 4 (visits 6, 7, 8 and 1 0), a full version of the ring acceptability 
questionnaire should be completed by the subject. The full version of the questionnaire con sists of 
questions related to ring insertion / removal, any feeling of the ring while the ring is in the body, 
any feeling of the ring during sexual intercourse if applicable and any experience of ring falling out 
or breaking (see Appendix 1). If it is con firmed that the ring is broken upon removal, a technical 
complaint form should be completed. If it is noted that the ring has been out of the body for more 
than 24 hours during the cycle, a medication error should be reported.   
The answer  must be reviewed  by the trial coordinator for the potential reporting of medicat ion error 
before the subject leaves the clinic.

endometrioma (s), ovarian cyst (s) and fibroid (s) if presented .  
Endometrial thickness  (composed of both layers of the endometrium) will be measured in the 
sagittal view of the ute rus from the proximal and distal interfaces between the echogenic 
endometrium and the hypoechoic inner layer of the myometrium. Care should be taken not to 
include  the presence of any fluid in the uterine cavity in calculating the endometrial thickness 
value. Endometrial thickness will be recorded in mm.  
Endometrioma , fibroid and ovarian cyst will be recorded as observed or not. If observed, the 
number and size of endometrioma (s), fibroid (s) and ovarian cyst (s) should be recorded.  
 
7.4.15  Vital Signs  
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as pulse will be measured before entry into  run-in 
(before or at visit  1), prior to randomization at cycle -1, during cycle -1 and at end -of-treatment  / 
cycle 4  (at visit 4, 5 and 1 0). Vital signs at randomizat ion will be baseline. Blood pressure and 
pulse should be measured before blood sampling as applicable, by automated oscillometric  device 
sequentially, first after the subject is in supine position for at least 3 minutes, then in seated position 
for at leas t 3 minutes, and then at 1 minute and at 3 minutes after  standing . Changes in blood 
pressure  will be calculated using the minimum stan ding measurement minus the seated 
measurement and minus the supine measurement , respectively .  
The investig ator will review the results of vital signs and evaluate and docume nt whether the 
finding is  clinically significant  or not .   
Before entry into  run-in (before or at visit  1) and before  randomization (at visit 4), subjects with a 
drop of 20 mmHg of systolic  blood pressure or a drop of 10 mmHg of diastolic blood pressure  from 
sitting to standing will be excluded from the trial.  
At other visits (visits 5 and 1 0), a drop of 20 mmHg of systolic  blood pressure or a drop of 
10 mmHg of diastolic blood pressure from  lying  to standing or from sitting to standing is  
considered clinically significant  and will be reported as adverse events .

suicidality , including suicidal ideations of type 4 ( active suicidal ideation s with some intent to act , 
without specific plan ), suicidal ideations of type 5 ( active suicidal ideation s with specific plan and 
intent ) and suicidal behavior.  
Before entry into  run-in (before or at visit 1), subjects having suicidal ideations of  type 4 or type  5 
during the past 12 months or having suicidal behavior during the past 5 years as identified by the 
eC-SSRS will be excluded  from the trial . Prior to randomization at visit 4, subjects having suicidal 
ideations of type  4 or type  5 or havin g suicidal behavior since last e -CSSRS assessment  will also be 
excluded from the trial. It is the investigator’s responsibility to advise subjects excluded from the 
trial due to risk of suicidality to seek help from their own physicians or suicide preventi on services.  
During the treatment  (at visits 7 and 10) , subjects having  suicidal ideations of type 4 or type 5 or 
having  suicidal behavior as  identified by the eC -SSRS should be referred to a mental health 
professional for further assessment and/or treatm ent. The decision on whether the treatment should 
be discontinued is to be taken by the investigator in consultation with the mental health professional 
to whom the subject  is referred.  
 
7.4.17  Concomitant Medication  
The use of any concomitant medication within the last 3 months prior to informed consent  for 
participation in the trial and throughout the trial will be recorded. Recording of concomitant 
medication other than ibuprofen and hydrocodone -acetaminophen  will be performed at all visits. 
Any changes in concomitant medications or treatments must be recorded at each visit. 
Investigators’ instructions for ibuprofen dosing and prescriptions of hydrocodone -acetaminophen 
will be recorded  in the e -CRF .

7.4.22  Optional Pharmacogenetic Analysis  
If the subject has provided a separate written informed consent  for genetic testing  (see section 
14.5), a sample of whole blood for  extraction and analysis of DNA will be collected within 1 -5 
days of the first ring insertion during  cycle 1 (at visit  5). The informed consent for genetic testing 
signed by the subject must be obtained prior to the sampling. All samples will be analyzed  for the 
presence of polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) gene, which codes for an 
enzyme involved in the metabolism of quinagolide.  
Additional analysis of other enzymes invo lved in the elimination processes of quinagolide may be 
performed on samples from subjects who display quinagolide metabolite M1 concentrations at 
similar levels as the parent compound and on a comparable number of control samples from 
subjects with low le vels of metabolites (M1<20% of quinagolide levels). Only enzymes responsible 
for the elimination  processes (i.e. metabolism, transportation and excretion) of quina golide will be 
analyzed . Results of the pharmacogenetic analysis will not be provided to th e sites. 
 
7.4.23  Optional Patient  Interviews  
A sub-group of 60 subjects including 5  non-completers from selected sites , if they have provided a 
separate informed consent,  will be invited to a patient  interview at the end of treatment  to help 
determine the meaningfu l treatment benefit from the patients’ perspective  and to assess the content 
validity of the questions related to daily functioning  in the e-Diary . The timing of the interview, i.e.

8.1 Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. It 
includes:  
• Any unfavorable  and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the 
use of the IMP, whether or not considered to be caused by the IMP.  
• Adverse events commonl y observed and adverse events anticipated based on the 
pharmacological effect of the IMP.  
• Any laboratory abnormality, vital sign s, ECG, echocardiography  or finding from  physical or 
gynecological  examination including transvaginal ultrasound assessed as cli nically 
significant by the investigator  [note: findings from  assessments and examinations done 
during  the screening  period  are not adverse events, but are recorded as medical history.]  
• Accidental injuries,  reasons for any medical, nursing or pharmacy consu ltation, or reasons 
for admission to hospital or surgical procedures.  
 
All adverse events will be coded by Ferring Pharmacovigilance using MedDRA  (the MedDRA 
version will be documented ).  
Medication errors of IMP will be captured by ring acceptability questionnaire  and/or a medication 
error form in the e -CRF .  
 
8.2 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
8.2.1 Collection of Adverse Events  
The investigator must monitor the condition of the subject t hroughout the trial from the time of 
obtaining informed consen t until the end -of-trial visit.  
The sources of adverse events cover:  
• The subject’s response to questions about her health (a standard non -leading question such 
as “How have you been feeling sinc e your last visit?” is asked at each visit).  
• Symptoms spontaneously reported by the subject.  
• Investigations and examinations where the findings are assessed by the investigator to be 
clinically significant changes or abnormalities.  
• Other information relati ng to the subject’s health becoming known to the investigator (e.g. 
hospitalization ).

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
The investigator must record all adverse events in the Adverse Event Log  provided in each 
subject’s e-CRF  with information about:  
• Adverse eve nt 
• Date a nd time of onset (time can be omitted, if applicable) [note: if date of onset of an event 
is the same as the date of informed consent or date of IMP administration, time is important 
and should not be omitted ] 
• Intensity  
• Causal relationship to IMP  
• Action taken to IMP  
• Other action taken  
• Date and time of outcome (time can be omitted, if applicable)  
• Outcome  
• Seriousness  
 
Each of the items in the Adverse Event Log is described in detail in the following sections.  
Adverse Event  
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and symptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis  / symptom should be entered per record.  
If a subject suffers from the same adverse event more than once and the subject recovers in between 
the event s, the adverse events should be recorded separately. If an adverse event changes in 
intensity, a worst -case approach should be used when recording the event, i.e. the highest intensity 
and the longest duration of the event.f 
Note : A procedure is not an ad verse event; the reason for conducting the procedure is. 
Hospitalization  is not an adverse event; the reason for hospitalization  is. Death is not an adverse 
event, but the cause of death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, which is an 
advers e event).  
Date and Time of Onset  
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted. If the adverse 
event is an abnormal clinically significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset 
 
f  Exception: if an adverse event with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e. a pre -treatment adverse event) 
changes i n intensity after the IMP administration, this must be recorded as two separate events. The initial adverse 
event should be recorded with outcome “not recovered” and the date and time of outcome is when the intensity 
changed. The second adverse event shoul d be recorded with date and time of onset when the intensity changed.

Intensity  
The intensity of an adverse event must be classified using the following 3 -point scale:  
Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.  
Moderate:  Event sufficient to aff ect usual activity (disturbing).  
Severe:  Inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).  
 
Causal Relationship to IMP  
The possibility of whether the IMP caused the adverse event must be classified as one of the 
following:  
Reasonable possibility:  There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship 
 between the IMP and the adverse event. The adverse event may occur 
 as part of the pharmacological action of the IMP or may be 
 unpredictable in its occurrence.  
    Examples:  
• Adverse events that are uncommon but are known to be strongly 
 associated with IMP exposure.  
• Adverse events that are not commonly associated with IMP 
 exposure, but the event occurs in association with other  factors 
 strongly suggesting causation , such as a strong temporal 
 association with the IMP or the event recurs on rechallenge with 
 the IMP.  
No reasonable possibility:   There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal 
 relationship between the IMP and the adverse event.  
    Examples:  
• Known consequences of the underlying disease or condition  
 under investigation.  
• Adverse events common in the trial population, which are also 
anticipated to occur with some frequency during the course of the 
trial, regardless of IMP exposure.

The action taken to the IMP in response to an adverse event must be classified as one of the 
following:  
• No change (medication schedule maintained or no action taken)  
• Discontinued  
• Interrupted  
 
Other Action Taken  
Adverse events requiring the rapy must be treated with recognized  standards of medical care to 
protect the health and well -being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines 
must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation.  
If medication is administered to treat the adverse event, this medication should be entered in the 
Concomitant Medication Log . 
Date and Time of Outcome  
The date and time the subject recovered or died.  
Outcome  
The outcome of an adverse event must be classified  as one of the following:  
• Recovered (fully recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at initiation 
of trial treatment)  
• Recovered with sequelae (resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity)  
• Recovering  (the event is improv ing) 
• Not recovered  
• Fatal  
 
8.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
8.3.1 Dizziness / Pre -syncope  
Dizziness or symptoms of pre -syncope (e.g. lightheadedness) will be report ed as adverse events.

Syncope is an adverse event of special interest in this trial  and any case s of sy ncope  will be 
reported as adverse events . Syncope is  defined as “orthostatic collapse associated with an abrupt, 
transient, complete loss of consciousness and inability to maintain postural tone, with rapid and 
spontaneous recovery ”. In case of syncope, further evaluations including vital signs should be 
conducted as soon as t he event is reported for the assessment of the causal relationship to the IMP .  
 
8.3.3 Dysmenorrhea , Abdominal Pain, Pelvic Pain, Lower Back Pain  and Dyspareunia  
Endom etriosis -related pain, i.e. pain located in the abdominal -pelvic area and the low er back area, 
will be assess ed by the subject  on the NRS scale on a daily basis. Dyspareunia will also be captured 
in the e -Diary in case of sexual intercourse. These data will be described as part of the primary and 
secondary endpoints  based on the subjects’ recordings in the diary .  
Presence of dysmeno rrhea , abdominal pain, pelvic pain or lower back pain related to endometriosis  
as well as menstrual cramp and  dyspareunia are not to be reported as an adverse event unless it 
fulfils the criter ia for an SAE . 
 
8.3.4 Vaginal  Bleeding  
Vaginal bleeding pattern (no bleeding, spotting, light bleeding, moderate bleeding and heavy 
bleeding) will be evaluated by the subject  in the e -Diary on a daily basi s. These data will be 
described as a secondary endpoint  based on the subjects’ recordings in the diary . Abnormal v aginal  
bleeding (e.g. amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea , spotting  or menstrual disorder ) is not to b e reported as 
an adverse event , unless there are any clinically significant changes from baseline that require 
medical or procedural intervention (e.g. prescription of tranexamic acid) or it fulfils the criteria for 
an SAE.  
 
8.3.5 Ring Acceptability  
Any feeling of the ring  will be assess ed by the subject  in a ring acceptability  questionnaire  at the 
clinic . Discomfort in connection with the ring  insertion and/or removal  should not be reported as an 
adverse event unless it requires active management, i.e. discontinuation of IMP . The acceptability 
of vaginal rings constitutes a secondary endpoint and will be evaluated in detail based on the 
subjects’ answers to the questionnaire.  Any occurrence of ring expulsion or ring breaking  will also 
be captured by ring acceptability questionnaire and should not be reported as an adverse event.

8.4 Pregnancy and Pregnancy Outcome  
If a pregnancy occurs, the IMP sho uld be immediately stopped and Ferring  Pharmacovigilance 
must  be informed  by mail to  within 3  calendar days.  Pregnancy 
should be reported as a non -serious adverse event (for tracking purpose only, pregnancy in itself is 
not an adverse event) . If a subject becomes pre gnant during treatment or follow -up period and the 
conception date cannot be determined, an ultrasound will be performed as part of the standard 
pregnancy check -up to assess the conception date.  The mother and the fetus must be followed up at 
least until the birth of the infant and 4-6 weeks after the birth of the infant. In general, the follow -up 
will include the course; du ration and the outcome of the pregnancy as well as neonatal health. If a 
pregnancy results in an abnormal outcome (b irth defect/congenital anomaly) , this must be rep orted 
as an SAE  to Pharmacovigilance . Abnormal pregnancy outcomes which the investigator and/or 
sponsor consider to be related to the IMP will be treated as expedited reports  (see section 8.5.2 ).

hospitalization  The term hospitalization  means that the subject was admitted to hospital or that existing 
hospitalization  was extended as a result of an event. Hospitalization  describes a period of 
at least 24 hours. Over -night stay for observation, stay at emergency room or treatment 
on an out -patient basis do not constitute a hospitalization . However, medical judgement 
must always be exercised and when in doubt the case should be considered serious (i.e. if 
case fulfils the criterion for a medically important event). Hospitalizations  for 
administrative or social purposes do not constitute an SAE. Hospital admissions and/or 
surgical operations planned before trial inclusion are not considered adverse events, if 
the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the trial, provided that the 
condition did not deteriorate during the trial.

The Global Biometrics Department of Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S will be responsible for data 
management, statistical analyses (including the sample size calculation and the statistical analysis 
plan), production of tables, listings and figures. This section details the planned statistical analysis 
of the primary endpo ints and outlines the planned statistical analysi s for the secondary endpoints. 
All analyses and further description of the statistical methodology for primary as well as secondary 
endpoints will be included in the statistical analysis p lan (SAP). The SAP will be available before 
breaking the blind.  
The Global Health Economics & Outcome Research Department of Ferring Pharmaceuticals A/S 
will be responsible for the validation of the Women’s Endometriosis Diary a nd the analysis will be 
described in a separate psychometric analysis plan. The results will be reported separately.  
 
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size calculation is based on demonstrating superiority of quinagolide vaginal ring 
compared with placebo vaginal ring on the primary endpoint  of the change  in mean daily NRS 
score for en dometriosis -related pain a t cycle 4 . Taking into account of an interim analysis for 
futility at a conditional power of 5%  (see section  9.9) and a ssuming that the  standard deviation of 
the change in mean daily NRS is 1.5, a sample size of 52 evaluable subjects per group (in total 
208 subjects) will have at least 90% power to detect a treatment effect difference of 1.0 unit using a 
t-test at a 5% two -sided significance level  in a pre -defined hi erarchical step -down procedure, 
starting with testing the highest dose versus  placebo (see section 9.6.2). Accounting for a 25% 
drop-out rate as observed  in a previous trial ,30 there should be 70 subjects randomiz ed to each 
treatment group  and in total 2 80 subjects should be randomiz ed. Table 9-1 summariz es the req uired 
sample size per group for different assumptions of treatment effect difference and power.

Subject disposition with respect to the timing of action  during the COVID -19 pandemic will be 
tabulated using the  intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis set . The status of randomized subjects at the 
time of the temporary trial hold  due to the COVID -19 pandemic will be summarized  in the  
following  categories : randomized and e xited  before the hold, randomized before and e xited during 
or after the hold , as well as randomized and e xited after the hold.  
Subject disposition with respect to analysis set will be tabulated by treatment group  for all 
randomiz ed subjects.

9.3 Protocol Devi ations  
Major protocol deviations, such as significant non -compliance or other serious unforeseen 
deviations deemed to invalidate the data and affect the conclusions of the trial, will lead to 
exclusion of data from the per-protocol ( PP) analysis set. Data will not be excluded from the PP 
analysis set in case of minor protocol deviations. The list of major protocol deviations include s, but 
is not restricted to:  
• Treatment received not in accordance with randomization  (only data after the occurrence of 
the mis take to be deleted)  
• Non-compliance with IMP treatment regimen  for >20%  of days during a non -menstrual 
period (only data after the first occurrence of non -compliance to be deleted)  
• Missing > 20% of days of e -Diary recordings during a  menstrual cycle  (only data of this 
cycle to be deleted from the respective by -cycle PP analysis ) 
• Use of prohibited analgesics for >1 day  during a menstrual cycle (only data of this cycle to 
be deleted from the respective by -cycle PP analysis)  
 
The detailed criteria of majo r protocol deviations will be further defined in the SAP. Unforeseen 
deviations deemed to impact the primary endpoint of the trial may additionally be rated as major 
protocol deviations by the Ferring clinical team on the basis of a blinded review of data before 
declaration of clean -file and lock of database.

The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be base d on the ITT analysis set , while the 
analysis of the primary endpoint based on the PP population  will be consi dered supportive  and 
serve as one of the sensitivity analyses .  
The analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed for both the ITT and PP 
population s. The safety endpoints will be analyzed  for the safety analysis set  unless otherwise 
noted .  
Statistical tests will be performed using a two -sided test at a 5% significance level. Treatment 
differences will (where appropriate) be presented with 95% confidence intervals and p -values 
corresponding to the statistical test of the hypothesis of “equ al effect” against the alternative of 
“different effect”.  
The SAP will detail data -handling conventions on cycle and menstrual period definitions.    
Continuous variables will be presented with number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, 
inter-quartile range, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be presented with number 
and percentage of subjects within each specific category.  
Missing Data  
Missing data for e ndome triosis -related pain  
If a subject has indicated that  too much pain is  the reas on for not completing the diary  on some day , 
the missing data for that day will be deriv ed by taking  a worst -case approach, i.e. assigning a n NRS 
of 10  for endometriosis -related pain . Otherwise the score remains to be missing.  
As endometriosis -related pain is p otentially different during the menstrual -bleedings days  from 
during the non -menstrual -bleeding days , at least 50% of the  NRS score s are required to be observed 
for both the mens trual period a nd the non-menstrual period  to be able to calculate the mean daily 
NRS sco re for a particular cycle. As missing NRS scores may not be appropriately balanced across 
menstrual period and non -menstrual period, the mean daily NRS score based on observed  data will 
be weighted by the lengths of the menstrual period and non-mens trual period to adjust for this 
potential imbalance.

Where

mpx is the mean daily NRS score based on observed NRS scores during the 
menstrual period, and  
mp nonx− is the mean daily NRS score based on observed NRS scores during 
the non -menstrual period.  
The observed cycle length will be based on the first  menstrual bleeding date confirmed at the 
RM+7 visit of each cycle (section 7.4.7 ). The length of the observed  menstrual period will be based 
on the first and last  menst rual bleeding date s confirmed at the RM+7 visit  of each cycle . If the l ast 
menstrual bleeding date can not be confirmed at the RM+7 visit (section 7.4.7 ), the date of the last 
reported menstrual  bleeding day recorded in the e -Diary will be used . The length of the observed  
non-menstrual period will be calculated as the observed cycle length minus the length of the 
observed menstrual period.  
Missing data for dysp areunia  
The mean daily NRS scores for the worst dyspareunia on days with sexual intercourse will be 
considered missing if the subject reports no sexual intercourse during a cycle. The mean score will 
be based on non -missing scores and will not be weighted by menstrual period length.    
Missing data for adverse events  
For adverse events, missing values will be treated as missing, except for causality, intensity, 
seriousness and outcome of adverse events, where a worst -case approach will be used.  
 
9.6.2 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is  the change in the mean daily NRS  score  for the worst en dometriosis -
related pain a t cycle 4 , i.e. the difference between the active treatment group  and the placebo group 
in the change  from baseline in  the mean daily NRS  score  for the w orst endometriosis -related pain at 
the end of cycle 4 . The baseline is defined as the average of the mean daily NRS  scores for 
endometriosis -related pain of the two run-in cycles ( cycles -2 and -1).  
The primary endpoint  will be analyzed  using a  repeated measures analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model , with the change in mean daily NRS score from baseline measured at cycles 1, 
2, 3, and 4 as the dependent variable, the baseline mean daily NRS score  and the baseline 
percentage  of days o n rescue analgesics  by type  as covariate s, as well as the treatment group and 
treatment by cycle interaction as fixed effect. The error -covariance matrix will be unstructured.  The

To assess the  dose-response association between the doses of quinagolide and the primary outcome, 
four dos e-response models i.e.  a linear dose -response model, an exponential dose -response model, a 
log linear dose response model, and a sigmoidal  dose-response model  will be fitted. The best fitting 
curve will be illustrated together with the dose specific means and standard errors of the mean .

Secondary endpoints of change from baseline in the mean daily NRS score for the worst 
dysmenorrhea and for the worst non -menstrual pelvic pain at cycle 4 will be analyzed  
longitudi nally and similarly to the primary endpoint , with the focus on estimating the treatment 
effect at c ycle 4. Sensitivity analyses will not be performed for secondary endpoints . 
Secondary endpoin ts over all 4 cycles or for cycles pre-specified in endpoints will be analyzed  
longitudinally as follows:   
• Continuous endpoints will be analyzed  by repeated  measures ANCOVA  
• Responder status endpoints will be analyzed  using repeated measures  logistic regression

Safety Laboratory Variables  
Safety laboratory varia bles will be grouped under “ hema tology ” and “ clinical chemistry”.  
The baseline is taken on LH +7 of cycle -1. Post -baseline clinical laboratory values are taken on 
LH+7 of cycle 4.  
The circulating levels of clinical chemistry and hematology  parameters including change s from 
baseline will be tabulated for each time point for each laboratory variable.  
Shift tables will be prepared to compare baseline values to the values at the respective post -baseline 
visits, using a categorization  of low, normal and high values defined according to the reference 
ranges provided by the central laboratory.  
For each laborat ory variable, a summary table will be prepared displaying the proportion of 
subjects who have at least one post baseline markedly abnormal value. The denominator will be the 
number of subjects with baseline and at least one post baseline value. The table w ill also include a 
break -down by classification of the baseline value. Markedly abnormal criteria for the safety 
laboratory values will be specified in the SAP .

9.9 Interim Analys is 
An interim analysis with the option  to stop the trial early due to futility wil l be performed by an 
external  statistician , when approximately half of the planned evaluable subjects (104 subjects) have 
completed the treatment p eriod  of the trial for the assessment  of the primary endpoint, using 
unblinded data  presented by treatment group .  
The futility bound is set at a conditional power using current trend equal to 5% , which means that 
the trial could potentially be stopped for futility , if the probability of achieving a significant result 
in the highest remaining dose group is lower than 5% based on the observed da ta at the interim  
analysis . In case of high drop -out rate or discontinuations in the highest dose group, the analysis 
will be performed on the remaining dose(s). If the probability is between 5% and 90%, the sample 
size will be re -estimated  by the external  statistician  based on the  unblinded data available at the 
interim analysis and ma y be increased to a total of 360  subjects.   
No interim analysis intended to stop the trial early due to overwhelming ef ficacy is planned.

10.3 Use of Patient Reported Outcome  
A newly developed PRO tool, Women’s Endometriosis Diary , which consist s of questions on 
endometriosis -related pain, vaginal bleeding, occurrence of sexual intercourse and the impact of 
endometriosis -related pain on functioning , is to be used in the present trial . Questions on daily 
analgesic use are included in the daily e -Diary, although they are not part of Women’s 
Endometriosis Diary. The development of the PRO is consistent  with the FDA’s PRO guidance33 
and follows the patient -focused  outcome measurement road map.  
All diary questions are  administered electronically through an app lication -based tec hnology (app) 
on a hand -held device  in the form of either the subject’s own phone or a provisional device .  
The e -Diary  data will be encrypted to ensure personal data privacy. No personal data will  be 
collected by Ferring from the subject s’ own phone s, if subjects choose to use their own phones . The 
download a nd installation process of the a pp will be controlled through a subject -specific activation 
code , allowing only subjec ts participating in the trial to download and install the app. The a pp will 
be PIN -protected to ensure that only the individual subj ect will be able to access the a pp. 
The electronic dat a collection procedure is compliant with FDA 21 C FR part 11 for el ectronic 
records.  Once subject s have  submitted their recording s, the data will be transmitted from subjects’ 
own phones or from their provision al device s to a third party database w ith backup and cyber -
security controls. No access to historically reported data will be given to the s ubjects once they 
have submitted their recordings.  Furthermore, no retrospective data entry will be allowed, i.e. no 
data entry after closure of the entry window, which is from 8 pm to 2  am every day for the daily 
diary and from 8  pm on Sunday s to 2 am on Tues days for the weekly diary . Reminder s will be se t 
up to remind subjects of completing  the diary when applicable . In the p resent trial, the investigator 
or the trial coordinator  will be encouraged to review the e -Diary  data regularly  in order to monitor 
subject compliance  with the e-Diary completion  and analgesic use . No m odification of subject 
reported  e-Diary  data will be made .  
In addition to the PRO collected via e -Diary, B&B, EHP -30, PGIS, PGIC , questionnaire for 
impulsive -compulsive disorders and ring acceptability questionnaire will be completed at the site  
via electronic tablets .

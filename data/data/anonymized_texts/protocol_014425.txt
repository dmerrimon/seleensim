Title of study: Sequential expansion of comparative effectiveness of oral anticoagulants: a cohort 
study
Team member 
Epide miology:
Project team :  
 
Rationale and 
background:A number of new oral anticoagulants are being developed and marketed to 
replace vitamin K antagonists.  Unlike vitamin K antagonists, these new drugs 
do not require dose titration involving intensive therapeutic monitoring of 
prothrombin time to achieve ta rget anticoagulation within a narrow 
therapeutic range. However, t heir long -term safety and effectiveness have not 
been characterized in a real -world setting.
Research question and 
objectives:This protocol is for a series of comparative effectiveness and safety analyses 
within periodically updated cohorts of patients initiating dabigatran 
(compared to warfarin) and other new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) (as they 
become available), compared to warfarin ,followed longitudinally for the 
occurrence of a variety of health outcomes.
Objectives
1)Primarily, to conduct direct comparisons over time between dabigatran 
and warfarin and quantify the association between anticoagulant choice 
and the occurrence of specific outcomes of interest
2)Secondarily, to monitor the number of people initiating other NOAC 
medications and, when sufficient, to compare study outcomes between 
other NOAC medications and warfarin 
Study design: Observational sequential cohort study based on existing data

Population: Patients with a recorded diagnosis of atrial fibrillation without evidence of 
valvular etiology who initiate dabigatran (or other NOACs as they become 
available) compared with warfarin initiators.
Study data source: This study will be conduc ted within both Unit edHealth and Marketscan data 
sources.  The first analyses of this study will include data from October 2010 
through December 2012 for the cohort formation and data from July 2008 
through September 2010 for disease risk score (DRS) calc ulation. Both data 
sources will be updated on a 6-month basis through Dec ember 2015
Expected study size: The estimated final study size will be ~ 60,000 dabigatran initiators, matched 
to ~60,000 warfarin initiators with approximately 24,000 cumulative person -
years of observation in each exposure group, and other NOAC initiators 
(numbers dependent on use) separately matched to a similar number of 
warfarin initiators.
The estimated study size (after PS matching) for interim analyses:
Interim report 1 ( Apr 2014 ): ~ 24,000 dabigatran and ~24,000 warfarin 
initiators with 10,000 PYs of observation in each group 
Interim report 2 ( Jul2014): ~ 30,000 dabigatran and ~30,000 warfarin 
initiators with 12,350 PYs of observation in each group
Interim report 3 ( Nov 2014): ~ 36,000 dabigatran and ~36,000 warfarin 
initiators with 14,700 PYs of observation in each group
Interim report 4 ( Mar 2015): ~ 42,000 dabigatran and ~42,000 war farin 
initiators with 17,050 PYs of observation in each group
Interim report 5 (Sep 2015): ~ 48,000 dabigatran and ~48,000 warfarin 
initiators with 19,400 PYs of observation in each group
Interim report 6 ( Mar 2016): ~ 54,000 dabigatran and ~54,000 warfari n 
initiators with 21,750 PYs of observation in each group
Final report (Dec 2016): ~ 60,000 dabigatran and ~60,000 warfarin initiators 
with 24.100 PYs of observation in each group

5. RATIONALE AND BACKGR OUND
A number of new oral anticoagulants are being developed and marketed to replace vitamin K 
antagonists, one of the most important drugs in modern medicine. [P11-11875 ]Unlike 
vitamin K antagonists, these new drugs do not require dose titration involving intensive 
therapeutic monitoring of prothrombin time to achieve target anticoagulation within a narrow 
therapeutic range. In Phase III studies, these drugs were found to be therapeutically  
advantageous or non- inferior over warfarin. In the coming years, as man y as six new 
anticoagulants could be on the market and a lack of valid comparative evidence will hinder 
prescriber and pay or decision -making.
To date, these drugs have been studied in randomized clinical trials for three separate 
indications: (1) prevention of stroke and s ystemic embolism among patients with atrial 
fibrillation; (2) prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) among patients undergoing hip 
or knee replacement therapy ; and (3) treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Phase III 
clinical trials comparing dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban , and edoxaban to warfarin in 
patients with non- valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) have been completed. [R11-4190 ] [P09-
11669 ] [R11-4223 ] [R13-5082 ] The objective of this part of the project is to conduct a series 
of comparative effectiveness and safety studies across the available anticoagulants, starting 
with warfarin and dabigatran and including additional ones as they  become available within 
data sources available to us at the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology .  Such sequential 
approach will extend Phase I analyses(study  protocol 1160.157) by providing greater 
precision around effect estimates as well as providing an evaluation of their use in actual 
practice and among subgroups of patients that were not represented in clinical trials.  This 
evaluation will provide a direct assessment of comparative ef fectiveness and potential 
adverse events across the anticoagulants that may  have eluded the pre -marketing trials.

6. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES
This protocol is for a series of comparative effectiveness and safet y analyses within 
periodicall y update d cohorts of patients with NVAF at risk for stroke initiating dabigatran or 
other oral NOAC medications as they  become available , compared to warfarin , followed 
longitudinally  for the occurrence of a variet y of health outcomes.
Specific objectives of this active surveillance program are: 
1)Primarily , to conduct direct comparisons over time between dabigatran andwarfarin and 
quantify  the association between anticoagulant choice and the occurrence of specific 
outcomes of interest
2)Secondaril y, to monitor the number of people initiating other NOAC medications as 
they become available and, when sufficient, to compare stud y outcomes between other 
NOAC medications and warfarin.

7. RESEARCH METHODS
7.1 STUDY DESIGN
This study  will involve a seq uentially  built parallel cohort design with propensity  score (PS) 
matching to address potential confounding. Each new data update will provide additional 
follow -up time on the patients alread y in the cohort, as well as new initiators who will be 
matched on PS and calendar quarter of initiation and added to the existing cohort for the 
cumulative anal yses. This study  design was selected to facilitate the inclusion of additional 
subjects and follow -up time as data become available over the course of the study  period.
The study  will be conducted within two US -based longitudinal healthcare claims databases 
(MarketScan and UnitedHealth Research Database, see also section 6.5 for more details). 
Cohort selection and all analy ses will be performed separately  within each database and a 
combined anal ysis that pools results from the two databases for the same time periods willbe 
done if appropriate, based on an assessment of homogeneity  of treatment effect.  Pooling of 
results across data sources will correspond to a weighted average effect (as in a fixed effects 
meta -analysis) using the Mantel -Haenszel method. [R97-0509 ]It is expected that there will 
be little heterogeneit y of treatment effects across the databases since the databases are similar 
with respect to who is included in the database (employ ed people and their dependents) and 
the nature of data captured (health insurance transactions billed on a negotiated fee for 
service basis). Heterogeneity  will be assessed by  comparing the treatment effect point 
estimates across data sources. Assessment of heterogeneity  will not rely  on a statistical test of 
heterogeneity , since the large study  size may  indicate significant heterogeneity  (p<0.05) even 
if estimates are similar (i.e. a difference that is not clinically  meaningful) and the purpose of 
this assessment of heterogeneity  is intended onl y for determining whether it is reasonable to 
combine data sources. If contrary to expectations, there is a difference >30% in the overall 
effect measure for a primary  outcome across the two data sources, we will conduct an 
additional investigation that assesses treatment effect within levels of protocol- specified 
subgroups (Section 6.9.2) separatel y by a database. If treatment effect is different across 
levels of the subgroup variable within a data source, and the distribution of this subgroup 
variable differs b y data source, then the p ooling will be conducted within strata of the 
subgroup variable or variables across which heterogeneity  is observed to account for this 
heterogeneity . 
The primary  anal yses will involve dabigatran initiators compared to warfarin initiators; as 
other NOAC medications become available for stroke prevention, we will form additional 
cohorts of other NOAC medications and separately  compare them to warfarin in the 
secondary  anal yses once sufficient number of initiators will have accrued. The same (as 
described below for dabigatran) inclusion/exclusion criteria will appl y and a similar set of 
analyses will be conducted.

Database and (2) MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database and Medicare 
supplement between October 2010 andDecember 2012 ,with 6 -month updates through 
December 2015. Initiators of other NOAC medications will be added as these medications 
become available for stroke prevention in NVAF. Da ta from July  2008 through September 
2010 will be used for disease risk score (DRS) calculation.

multivariate confounder summary  score (by  matching on the exposure propensity  score, with 
confounder balance assessed by  the disease risk score). [ R12-1912 ]
Cohort formation
We will receive new data as they  become available on a periodic basis (every  6 months) and 
we will update the stud y cohorts through December 2015. Initiators of oral anticoagulants
identified in each data cut , as previously  described, will form sequential cohorts.

In each sequential cohort we will balance baseline covariates among patients initiating each 
drug b y matching on the exposure propensity  score and calendar quarter of initiation. 
Patients’ follow -up will end when there is a treatment gap of ≥14 day s from the end of 
calculated day s supplied. Patients will be allowed to contribute only  once.

*as of December2013
The primary  contrast of interest is between new initiators of warfarin and new initiators of 
dabigatran, defined as no anticoagulation with any oral anticoagulant in the 12 months 
before the index prescription.
In the secondary  analy sis and as they  become available for stroke prevention in NVAF 
patients, other NOAC medications will be compared to warfarin. The same definitions and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be applied.
Concomitant therap y wit hmedications that are not cohort -defining medications (de fined as 
simultaneous use on the day  of dabigatran or warfarin initiation )will be accounted forin the
study analysesas a covariate and used for balancing or stratification.  
Study  follow -up
We will follow patients for each of the outcomes of intere st in a prospective manner and we 
will estimate measures of effect using person -time based anal yses.  
The primary  anal yses will use an ‘as treated’ approach.  Follow- up will start the day  after 
cohort inclusion, which is the day  of treatment initiation, and will end at the time of 
disenrollment, end of the observation period (available data), death, admiss ion to a nursing 
home, discontinuation of the index study  exposure, or switch to a different anticoagulant 
whichever comes first.  Exposure will be considered discontinued if there is a treatment gap 
≥14 day s from the end of calculated day s supplied. Warfa rin therapy  involves dose titration 
following initiation before a stable therapeutic INR is obtained. We will use the reported 
days’ supply  as a proxy  for duration of exposure following a dispensing as it may  more 
adequatel y reflect the use pattern within a commercial health insurer database represented b y 
UnitedHealth and MarketScan. This approach involves a potential mismatch between the 
presumed exposure derived from dispensing data and actual exposure.  The utilization study  
(described in stud y protocol 1160.177) will inform the sensitivity  anal yses around this 
assumption and seek to clarify  how sensitive results are to variations in the exposure 
assumption. Switchers will be censored in the as -treated approach on the day  of the 
dispensing of the alternative medication. If sw itching was the consequence of a side effect of 
a drug, most likely  the index drug was discontinued for some time before the new drug was 
initiated. Any  clinical event therefore was most likely  recorded during that period and will be Edoxaban Phase III N/A

7.4.2 OUTCOME(S)
The primary  outcomes of interest include stroke (hemorrhagic, ischemic, uncertain 
classification) and major bleeding. Secondary  outcomes are: stroke or s ystemic embolism, , 
transient ischemic attack (TIA), m yocardial infarction (MI), venous thromboembolism 
(VTE), deep vein thromb osis (DVT), pulmonary  embolism ( PE).
Systemic embolism (defined as an acute vascular occlusion of the extremities or any  organ, 
such as kidney s, mesenteric arteries, spleen, retina or grafts), ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic 
stroke, stroke of uncertain classi fications, major intracranial bleeding, major extracranial 
bleeding, major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, major upper GI bleeding, major lower GI 
bleeding, major urogenital bleeding, major other bleeding. Further outcomes include 
hepatotoxicity  and all -cause mortality .
  
As mortality  data in the commercial databases is currentl y limited to inpatient deaths, we will 
seek to improve the ascertainment of the death outcome through external linkage, such as 
with the Social Security  Death Master File.

7.5 DATA SOURCES
The data source for this project will be a combination of claims data from United Healthcare, 
a large national commercial health insurer, and MarketScan, a research claims database from 
commercial emplo yer-sponsored health plans from July  2008 through De cember 2012 for the 
first interim report, with 6 -month updates through Dec ember 2015. Data from July  2008 
through September 2010 will be used for DRS estimation (see Main Anal ysis Section (6.9.1) 
for more details) while data from October 2010 will be used for cohort formation and 
analysis. Because of a 6 -month time lag before data become available for United and 9-
month time lag for MarketScan
, we will not have access to an y information beyond 
December 2012 for the first interim report.

We have obtained the following preliminary  estimates from the UnitedHealth and 
MarketScan data bases regarding the number of patients initiating dabigatran or warfarin (new 
users) and meeting the main study  selection criteria in the period October 2010 –June 2012.

Warfarin 7,720 40,000 47,720
7.6 BIAS
Various design and anal ysis methods will be implemented to reduce the potential for bias in 
the study .  We will employ  new -user cohorts of NOAC medications and warfarin in order to 
address differences that might arise in the comparison of newer and older t reatments, such as 
survivor bias and attrition of susceptibles.  The comparator cohort will be formed from 
warfarin initiators with similar clinical profiles to dabigatran and other NOAC medications 
initiators to reduce confounding b y indication.  We will employ  propensity  score matching of 
NOAC/dabigatran and warfarin cohorts in order to improve the balance of the cohorts with 
respect to numerous variables and will further assess the balance across the matched cohorts 
on the basis of disease risk scores fo r the primary  outcomes.  We will use established

algorithms for outcome identification and onl y outcomes expected to be ascertained well in 
insurance claims.
7.7 STUDY SIZE
Theability  of this research program to detect a given risk increase depends on the incidence 
of the outcome as well as the number of cohort entrants and duration of follow -up. The stud y 
size will depend on the number of dabigatran (or other NOAC medications) and warfarin 
initiators who meet the study  inclusion and exclusion criteria and are successfully  matched 
into cohorts. On the basis of the outcome incidence rate observed in the comparison group in 
the pilot phase of this project (Phase 1)  and the cumul ative person
-time of observation over 
the study  period, we estimated the minimum relative rate that can be detected with 80% 
power for dabigatran -warfarin comparison ..  During the period October 2010 –June 2012, 
among patients with a minimum of 12 months baseline history , no prior use of an y 
anticoagulants, and a diagnosis of non-
valvular atrial fibrillation, there are 4,158 dabigatran 
incident users in the UnitedHealth database and approximately  20,000 dabigatran users in 
MarketScan database.   These dabig atran users will be matched to a similar number of 
warfarin incident users.  Assuming that approximately  70%  or patients will be matched, an 
average follow -up of 5months (both based on the preliminary  results from Phase 1 of the 
BI/  Pradaxa project) and the additional users who initiated dabigatran during July -
December 2012 period, there should be slightly  more 10 ,000  person -years of dabigatran 
follow -up for the initial analy sis.  As this project expands in 6 month increments, the person -
time, along with outcomes and the ability  to detect a particular relative risk will increase.
The table below provides estimates of the minimum relative rates that can be detected with 
80% power for the major study  outcomes under specific assumptions regarding thei r 
incidence in the comparator group (labeled “base rate”) and the accrual of person -time.  The 
base case incidence rates are the rates observed in warfarin initiators who were calendar 
quarter - and PS- matched to dabigatran initiators during the October 20 10-June 2012 period 
in the UnitedHealth database (Phase 1 of the project).  We conservativel y assumed that the 
number of patients initiating dabigatran each month during July  2012 – December 2015 is 
equal to the average monthly  number of initiators during the first half of 2012, that at least 
2/3 of these patients are matched 1:1 to comparator patients, and that each patient contributes 
0.41 y ears of follow -up time.

7.9 DATA ANALYSIS
All analy sis will be performed with SAS I nc, Version 9.3.
7.9.1 MAIN ANALYSIS
All analy ses will be conducted in both data sources and may  be combined in pooled anal yses 
if appropriate, based on homogeneity  of treatment effect. Pooling of results across data 
sources will correspond to a weighted average effect (as in a fixed effects m eta-analysis) 
using the Mantel -Haenszel method. [R97-0509 ]Heterogeneity will be assessed by comparing 
the treatment effect point estimates across data sources. If there is a difference > 30% in the 
overall effect measure for a primary  outcome across the two data sources, we will conduct an 
additional investigation that assesses treatment effect within levels of protocol -specified 
subgroups (Section 6.9.2) separatel y by a database. If treatment effect is different across 
levels of the subgroup variable within a data source, and the distribution of this subgroup 
variable differs b y data source, then the pooling will be conducted within strata of the 
subgroup variable or variables across which heterogeneity  is observed to account for this 
heterogeneity  (see Section 6.2 for more details). In each data source, w e will compare 
distributions of socio -demographic, clinical and utilization characteristics among initiators of 
different anticoagulant agents, and calculate event rates during follow -up for each of the 
specified outcomes.  
Unadjusted and adjusted relative risks (hazard ratios) and rate differences will be estimated. 
In adjusted anal yses, we will use propensity  score (PS) matching to balance potential 
confounders . [R13-1120 ] [R12-1912 ] PS will be derived from predicted probabilities of 
treatment initiation , given all measured covariates. We will estimate the primary  propensit y 
score for each patient using a logistic regression model that includes all pre -defined 
covariates (from Section 6.4.3). The propensity  score will be used to match dabigatran
initiators to initiators of warfarin on a 1:1 fixed ratio basis using a nearest -neighbor algorithm
and a caliper of 0.05 . In addition, patients will be matched on calendar quarter of initiation.
Individual covariates will be further tabulated and compared across matched cohorts. If 
substantial covariate imbalance between dabigatran and warfarin i s noted as assessed b y a 
standardized difference >0.1, then we will further adjust the outcome models for HAS -BLED 
and CHA 2DS 2-VASc score as Cohort Phase 1 results indicated that these scores include all 
the variables t ypically imbalanced.

The secondary  analy ses will involve other NOAC medications as compared to warfarin.  
Other NOACs will include rivaroxaban, apixaban and others once they  become available for 
stroke prevention in NVAF patients. We will monitor the number of patients initiating other 
NOACs and provide these numbers along with power calculations for primary  outcomes at 
each interim report. Once sufficien t numbers have accrued, and sufficient follow up time is 
available, these other NOAC initiators will be separatel y matched to warfarin initiators and 
primary  anal yses (and further/sensitivity  analy ses if numbers allow) as described above for 
dabigatran- warfarin comparison will be done.

7.10 QUALITY CONTROL
All aspects of data anal ysis will be conducted according to standard procedures of the 
Division of Pharmacoepidemiology . Programming for this project will be conducted b y a 
primary  anal yst and validated by aseparate analyst (validation anal yst).  For all data 
processing and anal ysis steps, the validation analyst will review the program along with input 
and output data sets, and for select steps of the project 
will employ  double programming 
techniques to redu ce the potential forprogramming errors.
7.11 LIMITATIONS OF THE R
ESEARCH METHODS
As an observational study, there are inherent limitations with respect to potential for alternate 
explanations for any observed association.
The source claims data include limit ations with respect to certainty  of capture of exposure, 
covariates, and outcomes.  As a comprehensive insurance database, essentially  all billable 
medical services will result in claims for reimbursement, so that certainty  of capture is tied to 
likelihood of a claim being submitted to the insurer. 
Given the characteristics of the UnitedHealth data (commercial health insurer), patients older 
than 65 y ears will be under -represented in the data. Only  approximately  35% of incident 
dabigatran users during the 2010- 2011 period were 65 y ears of age and older. As NVAF also 
predominatel y affects older population, it will be under -represented in the data as well.
Although duration of atrial fibrillation may  represent a risk factor for stud y outcomes, this 
covariat e will be incompletely  captured since the patient history  in the dataset is relatively  
short (at least 6 months, and an average of approximately  2 years), and a first claim within 
the database may  not represent atrial fibrillation onset since the condition is typicall y not 
diagnosed at its onset. 
Dosing of warfarin in clinical practice is complicated, and estimating dose and duration of 
exposure based on healthcare utilization data is therefore challenging.  The “day s’ suppl y” 
field is expected to be most meaningful, but the potential for misclassification exists.
There are a number of covariates, such as the t ype of atrial fibrillation, cause -specific 
mortality , BM I, smoking, that are not directly assessed in a health insurer database. 
Information on form ulary  and reimbursement is not available for MarketScan data.  Further, 
some covariates that can be directl y assessed through diagnosis and procedure codes (such as 
renal d ysfunction) have uncertain sensitivity , specificity , and predictive value. Estimatio n of 
creatinine clearance even in the subgroup of patients with laboratory  values present is not 
feasible as information on height and weight is not available. A modified MDRD equation is 
going to be used (see Further Anal ysis section), which 
-although found to accuratel y 
estimate GFR from serum creatinine measurements - is not used for dosing. In our study , 
however, we will only  use it to assess balance between exposure cohorts. 
In addition, medication use in United Healthcare data and MarketScan data - as in all 
administrative healthcare databases -is restricted to prescription drug medication.

Consequently , the use of over -the-counter (OTC) medications (e.g., OTC aspirin) is not 
captured. In addition, exposure is assessed based on prescription pick -up at a pharmacy and 
might be misclassified in “as treated” anal ysis if patients do not take their medications. 
However, misclassification of prescription drug exposure is generally  considered less than in 
other exposure assessment approaches, including phy sician prescribing records and patient 
self-reporting. [P13-03077 ] [P13-03078 ]

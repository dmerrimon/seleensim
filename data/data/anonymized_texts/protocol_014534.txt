 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable U nited States  government regulations and Mayo Clinic  research 
policies and procedures.  
4.1 Abstract  
 
Residual neuromuscular blockade is a common complication in the post- anesthesia care unit 
(PACU) when neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA s) have been used in the operating room.    
The only method of reliably detecting residual neuromuscular blockade is through the use of 
quantitative neuromuscular monitors.  Unfortunately, several barriers exist that have prevented 
the widespread application of these devices, and many practitioner s are still using qualitative 
(subjective) methods (i.e., use a peripheral nerve stimulator) as an assessment of neuromuscular blockade despite the lack of accuracy of subjective methods and the well -described morbidity 
and mortality associated with residu al blockade.  
 
The aim of this study  is to determine the usability of two different monitors, the 
acceleromyography (AMG) -based TOFScan (which relies on muscle movement for 
measurement of function) and the electromyography (EMG) -based TetraGraph (which relies on 
measurement of electrical activity) in surgical settings in which access to the arms and hand 
muscle movements are restricted.  
  The TetraGraph (Senzime AB, Uppsala, Sweden) is a standalone EMG -based quantitative 
monitor that received Conformité Européene (CE) and FDA approvals .  EMG measures 
electrical activity within the muscle following peripheral nerve stimulation and is unaffec ted by 
involuntary patient motion or restricted muscle movements from surgical positioning.  The 
IntelliVue (Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) is a modular AMG -based monitor that is being 
used routinely at Mayo Clinic for all surgical procedures in which NMBAs are administered. 
TOFScan (Draeger Medical Inc., Telford, PA) is another standalone AMG -based quantitative 
monitor available for routine clinical use in the United States. We plan to compare measurements obtained with Tetragraph and TOFScan monitors during surgical procedures in which the 
patients’ arms are tucked under surgical drapes and access is limited. The comparison will be based on a validated usability scale, the System Usability Scale (SUS) Plus  (Table 18. 3
 and 
Table 18.4 ) that was designed to rate the usability of medical devices.  
 
The o riginal System Usability Scale (SUS) was developed by John Brooke in 1986 
(https://www.usabilitest.com/system- usability -scale ), and it  allows investigators to evaluate a 
wide variety of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices and 
websites . It is a simple, ten -item Likert scale with five response options for respondents;  the 
responses vary from “Strongly agree ” to “Strongly disagree. ”  The scale provides a quick and 
reliable tool for measuring the usability  of the product in question.

The usability of the two monitors will be determined throughout various stages of neuromuscular 
blockade, including onset of blockade following neuromuscular relaxant administration, 
maintenance, and reversal of blockade with sugammadex or neostigmine unti l adequate recovery 
(train -of-four ratio >0.9) is confirmed.  At the end of each surgical case, the healthcare provider 
will be asked to rate the usability of the TetraGraph and the usability of the TOFScan monitors 
based on the ten items on the SUS scale.  
 
4.2 Background 
 
Neuromuscular blocking agents  (NMBAs)  are a class  of medications  routinely used during 
anesthesia to facilitate  endotracheal  intubation (1) and improve conditions for optimal surgery 
(2). However,  these  medications  are also associated  with respiratory  complications  in the early  
postoperative period due to residual  neuromuscular blockade (RNMB)  (3-5). Even  when  
neuromuscular blockade is reversed  in the operating  room, postoperative residual  weakness  
continues to be a common problem in the post- anesthesia  care unit (PACU),  and a significant 
number of patients  continue to arrive  in the PACU  with objective evidence of residual  
neuromuscular blockade (6, 7).  While  not every  patient  with residual  weakness  develops a 
postoperative complication,  many  can develop avoidable critical  respiratory  events  (8, 9).  
Furthermore, special  populations such as the elderly  are at particular  risk for developing 
complications  related  to postoperative residual  weakness  (10).   The use of quantitative  
monitoring has been  demonstrated  to reliably  reduce the incidence of postoperative residual  
weakness  and the ensuing complications  (11-13).    
Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring devices objectively measure residual weakness and display the results numerically.  This is traditionally accomplished by performing a tr ain-of-four 
(TOF) stimulation at the ulnar nerve and measuring the response of the adductor pollicis muscle.  The degree of muscle weakness is determined by calculating the TOF ratio, which consists of the 
ratio of the fourth muscle contraction to the firs t.  Adequate recovery that excludes clinically 
significant weakness from neuromuscular blockade is defined as a TOF ratio ≥ 0.9, a measurement that can be determined reliably only with a quantitative monitor (14, 15) .  With an 
abundance of literature supporting the use of objective neuromuscular monitors, a panel of experts recently recommended the uni versal adoption of such devices whenever NMBA are 
utilized (16)  however, quantitative monitors can be expensive and require additional training.  
There are several  t
 ypes of quantitative  neuromuscular monitors.   These  devices  can be 
incorporated into the anesthesia workstation, allowing  data to be seamlessly  integrated  into the 
electronic medical  record.   Unfortunately, this setup  can preclude using these  monitors  in the 
PACU  as portability  is sacrificed.   In contrast,  other monitor s exist  as standalone, portable (hand-
held) units.    
Aside  from  portability,  objective monitors can further be categorized  based  on the modality  
utilized  to measure responses.  Mechanomyography (MMG)  measures  the force  of contraction  of 
the adductor pollicis  (thumb) muscle  following ulnar  nerve stimulation  and has served  as the 
traditional “ gold- standard ”.  Mechanomyographic responses are precise and reproducible, 
AMG vs EMG limb restricted   Version 4.0 
  10/May/2021 
Page 10 of 35 
J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  however the setu p is cumbersome and the lack of commercially  available devices  has relegated  
MMG  to strictly  research  purposes. Acceleromyography  (AMG)  measures  acceleration  of a 
muscle  group (typically  the thumb) in response to stimulation  (typically  the ulnar nerve).  This 
technique is similar  to MMG,  but instead  of measuring  the force  of muscle contraction,  an 
accelerometer  fixed  to the thumb measures  the acceleration  of the thumb in response to ulnar 
nerve stimulation.   Based  on Newton’s  Second  law that states  force  is proportional to 
acceleration,  the measured  acceleration  is correlated  with the force  of contraction  in the clinical  
setting.   There are currently  two standalone AMG -based  monitors available for clinical  use: the 
STIMPOD  (Xavant  Technologies,  Pretoria,  South Africa)  and the ToFscan  (Draeger  Medical  
Inc., Telford,  PA).  These  devices  represent  improvements  in AMG  technology over its 
predecessor,  the TOF -Watch  (Schering -Plough Corp.,  Kenilworth,  NJ, USA)  as they utilize  three  
dimensional transducers  that can better  quantify the complex  motion  of the thumb.   Despite  these  
advances,  the use of AMG  can be limited  due to patient positioning that precludes  free motion  of 
the thumb, as well instances  of awakening  patients  moving their thumb during measurements.   
Kinemyography (KMG)  is based  on similar  principles  to AMG , and relies  on the thumb being 
able to move freely.   Upon neurostimulation, KMG  utilizes  a piezoelectric motion  sensor  that is 
bent between  the thumb and index fingers following muscle  contraction.   The degree of this 
bending is quantified and used to determine a TOF  ratio.   While  Datex -Ohmeda (Helsinki,  
Finland) manufactures  a KMG  device that can be incorporated into the anesthesia work  station,  
there are no currently  available standalone KMG  devices.   Electromyography (EMG)  devices  
measure electrical  activity,  termed  compound muscle  action  potentials  (cMAPs)  following nerve 
stimulation  (typically  at the adductor pollicis  muscle  after ulnar nerve stimulation).   As EMG  
measures  cMAPs and does not require freely  moving thumbs for accurate measurements,  many  
experts  have referred  to this monitoring modality  as the “new  gold standard”.  TetraGraph  
(Senzime AB, Uppsala,  Sweden)  is a standalone EMG -based  device that is FDA-approved.   We 
have previously investigated  this device and presented  our findings at several  annual meetings  
such as International Anesthesia  Research  Society  (May  2018, May 2017, May 2013), the 
Society  for Technology in Anesthesia  (January  2018), and the American  Society  of 
Anesthesiologists ( October  2017, October  2012), European Society  of Anaesthesiology (June 
2018, June 2015) (17). Furthermore,  we have recen tly submitted  abstracts  to the PostGraduate 
Assembly  in Anesthesiology in December  2018 as well as a manuscript describing a multi-
center,  volunteer study investigating  TetraGraph  versus  AMG -based  monitors.   Our  work  thus 
far has found this device to be easy to apply, reliable,  and able to provide comparable 
measurements  to other quantitative  monitors.    
Many clinicians default to the antiquated practice of subjective monitoring (18, 19) , whi ch refers 
to visual or tactile evaluation of the train -of-four (TOF) in response to neurostimulation provided 
by peripheral nerve stimulation. However, subjective evaluation may provide inaccurate 
information and assessment of full recovery compared to objective evaluation (20, 21) . A 
consens us statement by the international panel of experts in neuromuscular blockade issued in 
2018 state that subjective evaluation is not predictive of adequate neuromuscular recovery, and is 
not sensitive to the presence of residual weakness. They state that th eir use should be abandoned 
AMG vs EMG limb restricted   Version 4.0 
  10/May/2021 
Page 11 of 35 
J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  in favor of objective monitoring, because after the TOFR recovers to >0.40, anesthesia providers 
can no longer detect the presence of fade by subjective evaluation and they may assume a 
complete recovery from neuromuscular blockade, despite the presence of minimal levels of 
NMB (16). It is worth highlighting that after tracheal extubation, even minimal degrees of 
residual block is  associated with impaired function o f respiratory and pharyngeal muscles , upper 
airway obstruction (22),hypoxemia (23) , and awareness duri ng anesthesia  (24)  
 
Utilizing  recommendations from  the Good Clinical  Practice (GCP)  Guidelines for monitoring  of 
neuromuscular function (25), we will compare acceleromyographic and electromyographic 
responses to train-of-four stimulation  of the ulnar nerve in surgical  settings  where the arm 
movement is restricted  by the surgical  drapes  (such  as laparoscopic and robotic surgery). The 
time points of interest  will include the onset of blockade following neuromuscular relaxant 
administration, maintenance of block, and reversal of blockade with sugammadex or neostigmine 
until adequate recovery (train -of-four ratio >0.9). The reliability of the two monitors will be 
evaluated post hoc by comparing the repeatability of responses, and the usability of the two monitors will be evaluated by the healthcare providers using the System Usability Scale (SUS) 
Plus scale, a simple, 10 -item Likert scale with 5 response options for the evaluator s 
(https://www.usabilitest.com/system- usability -scale).  
 
4.3 Risk s and Benefits  
• The benefits of using neuromuscular blockade monitoring devices:   
Early detection of optimal time for tracheal ex tubation; optimal management of 
intraoperative depth of neuromuscular block to facilitate surgical procedures; 
determination of appropriate time and dose of sugammadex reversal; and detection of 
residual neuromuscular blockade. This is currently the standard of ca re practice at Mayo 
Clinic.  
• The risks of using neuromuscular blockade monitoring devices:  
Slight discomfort when electrical stimulation is administered  in awake volunteers; 
however, our patients will be anesthetized, rendering this risk as extremely minor.  
 Study Objectives  
 Primary Objective  
Compare the objective EMG -derived data using TetraGraph  (TOFR, TOFC, PTC) with those 
obtained from the AMG -based TOFScan monitor and assess the reliability and usability of the 
two objective monitors.  
 
Secondary Objective  
Determine the incidence of failure to calibrate and monitor neuromuscular responses using the two monitors.

  10/May/2021 
Page 13 of 35 
J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  The primary endpoint of the study will be to determine the usability of the two monitors using 
the SUS Plus scale.  
6.5 Secondary Study Endpoints  
 
The secondary endpoint is to determine the reliability of the two monitors, by comparing the 
frequency of each mo nitor’s failure to calibrate and measure evoked responses.  
6.6 Identification of Source Data  
 The study data points will be recorded on the developed Case Report Forms (CRFs) by the study 
team members.  In addition to the data collected intraoperatively , sever al intraoperative 
characteristics will also be extracted from the medical record ( Table 18.2
).  These will include 
type and total dose of NMBA used, time and dose of last NMBA administration, time and dose of specifi c reversal agent administration, time of tracheal extubation, and TOF ratio at the time 
of extubation (if available).

 Study D evice  
8.1 Description  
 
TetraGraph  (Figure 19.1 ) device is a FDA approved neuromuscular transmission monitor 
capable of measuring the depth of neuromuscular block in anesthetized patients who received 
neuromuscular blocking agents. TetraGraph uses EMG to measure the muscle action potentials 
that are generated in response to electrical neurostimulation  via skin (ECG) electrodes .  
TetraGraph data is recorded on the monitor’s built -in SD card, and all intraoperative data will be 
recorded and later downloaded for purposes of analysis. The recorded data do not contain PHI, 
only the da te/time of recording , and any additional intraoperative interventions, such as the time 
of NMBA dose administration, time of antidote administration, time of extubation, etc .  These 
events are flagged in the monitor’s integrated SD card recordings.  
 TetraG raph uses EMG to measure the muscle action potentials that are generated in response to 
percutaneous electrical neurostimulation, and is not subject to the limitations imposed by the AMG -based monitors: the measurement of the electrical compound muscle action potentials 
(cMAPs) can be made even when the thumb movement is restricted.

Page 15 of 35 
J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  The TOFScan (Figure 19.2 ) is a neuromuscular transmission monitor that is based on AMG 
technology, and is used routinely in clinical care at Mayo Clinic. It can measure and record the 
evoked responses (acceleration) of the hand muscle adductor pollicis (thumb) and calculate the 
degree of neuromuscular block (the TOF ratio).  
 
8.2 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
 
This is an open- label  investigation and all study participants are assigned to both TetraGraph and 
TOFScan devices . The randomization involves the use of dominant vs non- dominant arm  for the 
placement of TetraGraph device. 
 The randomization will be performed utilizing REDCap and assigned anesthesia clinical care

 Study Procedures  
 
9.1 Visit 1  (Screening and Enrollment  up to the day of surgery ) 
 
• Review of medical record  
• Informed Consent  - Patients will be identified  during their preoperative appointment and 
introduced to a study; they will be provided with a copy of the consent document and 
information about the study. The consenting will take place after additional discussion on 
the day of surgery.  
 
9.2 Visit 2  (Randomization and Treatment  – day of surgery) 
 
• Elective surgical procedure as in which intraoperative access to the arms is restricted 
because of surgical draping.  
• Anesthetic management will be standardized to utilize rocuronium, sevoflurane, and 
sugamm adex or neostigmine at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist  
• Prior to induction of anesthesia, the Tetragraph electrodes will be placed over the ulnar nerve and the thumb to measure the response of adductor pollis nerve. Randomization will be pe rformed utilizing REDCap and involves the use of dominant vs non-dominant 
arm.

J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  • Following induction of anesthesia but prior to NMBA administration, baseline values will 
be recorded from both monitors after calibration.  
• Anesthesia providers will have access to the TetraGraph and TOFScan values during the 
entire procedure, and will make clinical decisions as per usual clinical routine at Mayo Clinic.  
• After NMBA administration, sets of measurements will be taken with the two monitors at regular intervals (every 12 sec, 20 sec, 1 min, 15 min, etc.) as required per usual clinical routine and determined by the anesthesia attending.  
• Near the conclusion of the operation but prior to the reversal of neuromuscular block, another s et of measurements will be taken, with the two monitors, as per usual clinical 
routine, in order to determine the appropriate reversal drug dosage.  
• After sugammadex or neostigmine administration, measurements will be taken every 20 seconds until return of  neuromuscular function is documented.   
• Following documentation of adequate neuromuscular function ( TOF ratio is >0.9, ) the 
devices will be removed and the patient will proceed along the standard recovery 
pathway.

 Statistical Plan  
10.1 Sample Size Determination  
 Based  on paired  t-test, 23 enrolled  patients  will give 90% power to detect  a difference in TOF  
ratios  with a significance level  of 0.05 (JMP  Pro Software  version 13.0.0 
 [August 23, 2018]; SAS Institute  Inc., Cary,  NC).  We utilized  a standard  deviation of 0.07 that 
was determined  during our multi- center  volunteer study comparing another AMG  device and 
TetraGraph.  However,  each participating  center   will enroll 35 patients  to take into account  
AMG vs EMG limb restricted   Version 4.0 
  10/May/2021 
Page 17 of 35 
J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  patient  loss or missing  data.  The total number of patients  for this study from  all 3 centers  will be 
aimed  at 105 participants.   
   
10.2 Statistical Methods  
 
10.2.1  Descriptive Statistics  
 
Analysis of agreement  between  the two monitors will be assessed  using Bland -Altman.  The 
limits  of agreement  are defined  as bias ± 2 SD, where  SD denotes the standard  deviations of the 
differences.   Limits  of agreement  are interpreted  as the reference range within  which  95% of the 
differences  will lie.  The bias and the limits  of agreements  surrounding the bias (± 2 SD) will be 
calculated  with 95% confidence intervals.   Statistical  significance will be defined as a p-value 
<0.05.   Comparison of the usability  of the two monitors  will be made using the System  Usability  
Scale (SUS)  Plus.  The SUS is particularly  relevant to user experience when  compari ng two 
monitors that are based  on different  technologies (AMG  and EMG) . It will allow  us to make a 
comparison of the two monitors  in a surgical  setting  in which  access  to the monitoring  muscle  
site (the thumb and hand) is limited.  Because SUS is technology- neutral,  we will be able to 
continue to use it in usability  testing  as technology evolves over the years,  allowing us to 
continually evaluate and select  the optimal  monitoring  technology available.   
10.2.2  Handling of Missing Data  
 
This is a prospective pilot study and therefore we do not anticipate any missing data.  In the 
event of any unexpected missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made; 
missing data will simply be treated as missing in the statistical analysis , and replacement 
participants will be enrolled to ac hieve the target accrual of n=35 participants . 
10.3 Subject Population(s) for Analys is 
 
Each participant who goes through the surgery and completes monitoring of residual 
neuromuscular blockade will be included in the primary analysis regardless of study withdrawal 
for any reason. In the event of any study withdrawals, in secondary analys is we will examine the 
sensitivity of our results to the exclusion of patients who withdrew.  
 Safety and Adverse Events  
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  (UPIRTSO)  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
AMG vs EMG limb restricted   Version 4.0 
  10/May/2021 
Page 18 of 35 
J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  • Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospitalization - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) 
breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opinion 
of the local investigator may adversely affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects 
or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, or not part of an underlying 
disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its 
occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased 
frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A p roblem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
11.1.2  Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, 
device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
11.1.3  Serious Adv erse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well 
defined and include ; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience 
• hospitalization  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity 
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• birth defect/anomaly  
 
and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opinion of the sponsor-investigator 
may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially com promised the research data.  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious , should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
11.1.4  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
 For this study, the follow -up period is defined as up to 10 minutes after arrival to PACU or TOF 
ratio is > 0.9 (whichever occurs first).  
 
AMG vs EMG limb restricted   Version 4.0 
  10/May/2021 
Page 19 of 35 
J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  11.1.5  Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or  the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period.  
11.1.6  Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the sponsor- investigator until the events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last 
scheduled visit, the sponsor- investigator should instruct each subject to report , to the sponsor-
investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be rel ated to participation in this study.   
 
11.1.7  Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event.   
 Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalizatio n, nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:   
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the 
clinical investigator.  
 
11.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the study team  must seek information on adverse events by 
specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event section  of the electronic case report form (CRF ). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and 
abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or  procedure results should recorded in the source document . 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of  
each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  probable cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up , to determine the 
final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs during the Adverse Event Reporting 
Period  and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation should be recorded and repor ted immediately.  
11.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
 
When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take appropriated action 
necessary to protect the study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Wo rksheet 
AMG vs EMG limb restricted   Version 4.0 
  10/May/2021 
Page 20 of 35 
J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  and log.  The sponsor -investigator will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up 
and reporting required.  
 
11.3.1  Sponsor -Investigator reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB   
 
The sponsor -investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPIRTSOs and Non -UPIRTSOs 
according to the Mayo IRB Policy and Procedures.  Each participating site will report SAEs to 
their respective IRB or Ethics Committee with copy of submission and review provided to the 
leading site. Should there be any SAEs at any of the participating sites;  the study team at that site 
will notify the primary site (Mayo Clinic in Florida) within 24 hours of learning of the event.  
 
Any serious adverse event (SAE) which the Principal Investigator has determined to be a 
UPIRTSO will be reported to the Mayo IRB as soon as possible but no later than 5 working days 
after the investigator first learns of the problem/event. 
 
The following i nformation will be collected on the adverse event worksheet (and entered in the 
research database):  
• Study ID  
• Disease   
• The date the adverse event occurred  
• Description of the adverse event  
• Relationship of the adverse event to the research device * 
• Determination if the adverse event was expected   
• The severity of the adverse event (severity scale described below **) 
• If any intervention was necessary  
• Resolution (was the incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment)  
• Date of Resolution 
 
The sponsor -investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if specific reports 
need to be made to the IRB .  The sponsor -investigator will sign and date the adverse event report 
when it is reviewed.  For this protocol, only directly related SAEs /UPIRTSO s will be reported to 
the IRB.  
 
 
* Relationship Index  
 The relationship of an AE to the Invest igational Device is a clinical decision by the sponsor -
investigator (PI) based on all available information at the time of the completion of the e CRF and 
is graded as follows:  
 1. Not related: a reaction for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to the use and proper application of study device.  
 
AMG vs EMG limb restricted   Version 4.0 
  10/May/2021 
Page 21 of 35 
J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  2. Unlikely : a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship 
to use of the study device which makes a causal relationship improbable an d in which use of  
other devices , chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations.  
 
3. Possible: a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to use of the study device but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or 
use of other devices  or chemicals . 
 4. Probable: a clinical event including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to use of the study device, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or use of other 
devices  or chemicals . 
 5. Definite: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from  the use of the study 
device.  
 
** Severity Scale  
 The maximum intensity of an AE during a day should be graded according to the definitions 
below and recorded in details as indicated on the CRF. If the intensity of an AE changes over a 
number of days, then separate entries should be made having distinct onset dates.  
 1. Mild: AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere with 
patient’s  daily activities.  
 2. Moderate: AEs typically introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern  to the patient and 
may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures.  
 
3. Severe: AEs interrupt a patient's usual daily activity and traditionally require  systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  
 
11.4 Medical Mon itoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above, as well as the constructi on and implementation of a site data and safety-
monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting” ).  Medical 
monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
 
 Data Handling and Recor d Keeping  
12.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
AMG vs EMG limb restricted   Version 4.0 
  10/May/2021

J. Ross Renew, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  • Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authoriz ation.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
12.2 Sour ce Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents and data records 
include: hospital records and any forms completed specifically for this study.  
12.3 Case Report Forms

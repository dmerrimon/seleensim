Glossary
Term
Definition
Accuracy
Rate of correct predictions made by the 
Device on a set of voice samples. Accuracy is 
estimated by using independent data that 
was not used at any time during the training 
process.
AE
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward 
medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including 
abnormal laboratory findings) in participants, 
users or other persons, whether or not related 
to the investigational Device.
Algorithm
A process or set of rules to be followed in 
calculations or other problem-solving 
operations, especially by a computer.
Anxiety Disorders
Anxiety disorders involve anxiety that does 
not go away and can get worse over time. 
Symptoms can interfere with daily activities. 
There are multiple types of anxiety disorders 
including generalized anxiety disorder, panic 
disorder, and various phobia-related 
disorders.
API
The Application Programming Interface is a 
type of software interface offering a service to 
other pieces of software. The API can be 
electronically interfaced and perform analysis 
with data transferred from computer-based 
applications.

has been formally designated to review and 
monitor biomedical research involving human 
subjects.
MDD
Major Depressive Disorder is a mood 
disorder that causes a persistent feeling of 
sadness and loss of interest. It affects how 
you feel, think, and behave and can lead to a 
variety of emotional and physical problems. 
Also called clinical depression.
ML
Machine Learning
is the study of computer 
algorithms that can improve automatically 
through experience and by the use of data 
instead of being explicitly programmed. It is
10
seen as a part of artificial intelligence. 
Machine learning algorithms build a model 
based on sample data, known as training 
data, in order to
make predictions or 
decisions without being explicitly 
programmed to do so.

administered to study participants.
12
Background Information
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide.
1,2
 Depression and 
anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent of all mental disorders.
3
Approximately eight 
percent of adults in the United States reported having at least one major depressive episode 
and 18.1% of adults in the US have anxiety disorder.
3,4
Depression and anxiety disorders are a 
frequent comorbidity for patients suffering from chronic medical diseases, such as diabetes, 
cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease.
5-7
Multiple
studies show a 2-3 fold increase in the cost 
of treating these chronic conditions, if their depression goes undiagnosed or untreated. Early 
detection of disorders is key to both better health and economic outcomes.
8
Diagnosing 
depression and anxiety can be challenging since there is no current biomarker test used to 
detect the possible presence of these conditions. The PHQ-2 / PHQ-9 screener, which can 
either be self-administered or administered by a clinician, is the most commonly used diagnostic 
instrument. Even though the US Preventive Services Taskforce and the American Academy of 
Family Physicians recommend screening in individuals 12 and older,
9,10
with the US primary 
care visit averaging 16 minutes, mental health screening is frequently skipped,
11
and only an 
estimated 4.2% of primary care patients are screened for these conditions.
The DSM-5, the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals 
in the US, has definitions for MDD and anxiety disorders. However, reliability of psychiatric 
diagnosis is still low, even among psychiatrists.
12
Because psychiatric diagnoses are often 
based on inferences derived from observation of patient behavior and patient self-reports, 
interrater reliability are moderate, typically ranging between kappa values of 0.4 to 0.6.
13
Primary care clinicians provide the majority and an increasing percentage of mental health 
care.
11
If the agreement between psychiatrists, specialists
trained specifically on mental health 
care is low - the expectation is that it will be even more challenging for primary care clinicians to 
diagnose depression and anxiety.
According to a global
Lancet study,
the General Practitioners’ 
sensitivity is 47.3%.
14
Multiple studies describe
the underdiagnosis of depression and anxiety, 
which is even more pronounced among the more medically disenfranchised demographic 
groups such as the elderly and racial minorities.
15
Kintsugi, a digital health technology company based in Berkeley was founded to address these 
challenges. Kintsugi initially started by creating a consumer application, a voice journaling 
wellness app that is available on the Apple App Store. This app allows users to journal by 
speaking, interact with community members who share similar challenges, and track their 
wellness and mental health over time to promote mental wellbeing. Based upon their preliminary 
work and user engagement, the Kintsugi team applied for and was awarded several National 
Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants to develop new Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare. Most recently, the team is developing an AI-based 
algorithm that is able to detect signs of depression and anxiety from short clips of free-form 
speech. The Kintsugi Voice Device
is the result of
these efforts.
Voice biomarker technologies provide a unique way to scale access to mental healthcare by 
assisting clinicians with the screening and triage especially in high-volume environments where 
administrative burdens are high and mental health conditions are often overlooked. 
Researchers have attempted to find objective methods to increase the accuracy of depression 
and generalized anxiety disorder diagnoses, and voice-based biomarkers are attractive 
because of their non-invasive nature and ability to provide passive monitoring.
13
Study Device Description
The Kintsugi Voice Device (“Device”) is a software API that allows the clinician to upload a voice 
sample for analysis from an individual ≥ 22 years old. The API can be electronically interfaced 
and perform analysis with data transferred from computer-based applications. The Kintsugi 
Voice Device output is adjunct to clinical assessment and provides a sensitive reliable estimate 
of the presence of vocal characteristics consistent with a significant depressive episode and/or a 
clinically significant anxiety state, which are a necessary condition for the diagnosis of lifetime 
mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder. The 
Kintsugi Voice Device is not to be used in-lieu of full patient evaluation or relied upon to make or 
confirm diagnosis but offers objective signals in the global assessment of mood and anxiety 
disorders.
The Device comprises of the following:
●
An API that can be integrated into different clinical workflows. Input of the API is a
patient voice sample that is at least 60 seconds
●
Underlying machine learning algorithm that drives the Device outputs (“Algorithm”)
●
Depression and Anxiety are separate algorithms
The Device output is the following:
●
For depression:
○
The voice sample contains characteristics of depression (the model has high
confidence that the speaker has depression),
○
The voice sample does not contain characteristics of depression (the model has
high confidence that the speaker does not have depression),
○
Indeterminate (the model doesn’t have high confidence to classify the patient as
depressed or not depressed)
●
For anxiety:
○
The voice sample contains characteristics of anxiety (the model has high
confidence that the speaker has anxiety),
○
The voice sample does not contain characteristics of anxiety (the model has high
confidence that the speaker does not have anxiety),
○
Indeterminate (the model doesn’t have high confidence to classify the patient as
anxious or not anxious)
Principles of Operation
The
Kintsugi
Voice
Device
technology
is
based
on
a
large
and
growing
body
of
research
on
voice
biomarkers
and
their
ability
to
detect
and
predict
various
neurological
and
mental
disorders.
16–18
Voice biomarkers are a set of acoustic
features extracted from voice signals.
19
Producing
speech
involves
coordination
of
various
cognitive
and
motor
processes
therefore
samples
of
speech
provide
insight
into
the
state
of
physical
and
mental
health.
Speech
has
14
been
studied
for
a
variety
of
health
conditions
including
dementia,
aphasia,
Parkinson’s,
Alzheimer’s disease, and various psychiatric conditions.
19–24
There
have
been
studies
on
the
relationship
between
voice
and
cognitive
behavior
since
the
1920s.
Individuals
with
depression
have
been
reported
to
have
lower
pitch,
more
monotonous
tone,
lower
sound
intensity,
and
lower
speech
rate
as
well
as
more
hesitations,
stuttering,
and
whispering.
25
Longer
speech
pause
times
were
correlated
with
depression
and
the
reduction
in
speech
pause
times
was
used
to
identify
clinical
improvement
among
both
unipolar
and
bipolar
patients
with
depression.
26,27
More
recently,
Mundt
et
al.
demonstrated
in
a
landmark
study
of
105
patients
that
it
was
possible
to
collect
speech
samples
from
an
automated
telephone
system
and
measure
the
severity
of
depression
and
treatment
response
by
using
voice
biomarkers.
28
Since
then,
multiple
groups
have
created
models
to
study
the
effects
of
depression
on
phonemes,
which
is
the
unit
of
sound
that
can
distinguish
one
word
from
another.
29,30
Articulatory-phonetic
units
of
speech
can
capture
the
effects
of
different
psychiatric
symptoms
and
be
used
to
deduce
the
severity
of
psychiatric
symptoms
from
the
human
voice.
29
In
a
review
of
1395
studies
on
using
speech
to
identify
the
presence
or
severity
of
cognitive
disorders,
Low
et
al.
2020
analyzed
127
of
these
studies
and
synthesized
the
features
that
had
predictive
power
for
multiple
cognitive
disorders,
including
depression,
anxiety,
schizophrenia,
and
hypomania
(Figure
1).
31
As
shown
in
Figure
1,
every
acoustic
feature
that
had
predictive
power
for
depression
also
had
predictive
power
for
anxiety,
which
serves
as
the
fundamental
basis for the Device’s operation.
31
System or Device Components Description
15

The
Device
is
composed
of
a
neural
network-based
algorithm
that
analyzes
voice
recordings
to
screen
for
signs
of
depression
and
anxiety.
The
audio
files
that
are
used
as
input
to
the
algorithm
are
recorded
by
general
use
computing
platforms
(e.g.,
cellphone,
tablet,
laptop)
and
are
stored
as
uncompressed
audio
in
raw
form.
It
is
then
pre-processed
using
the
following
process:
●
resample the data to match specifications
●
evaluate the quality of the speech sample
●
normalize the loudness of the audio
●
transcode the audio from the original encoding to linear pulse-code modulation
●
trim the pauses at the beginning and end of the audio file
Once
processed,
vocal
features
are
extracted
from
the
audio
and
inputted
into
the
neural
network
models.
The
software
interprets
the
acquired
signals
using
signal
processing
and
an
artificial
neural
network
to
quantitatively
evaluate
voice
characteristics
for
presence
of
indicators
correlated
to
depression
and
anxiety.
The
Kintsugi
Voice
Device
then
generates
an
output
for
signs
of
depression
and
anxiety
which
is
displayed
to
the
Device
Operator.
The
Kintsugi
Voice
Device
output
will
be
positive
for
depression
or
negative
for
depression
and
positive
for
anxiety
or
negative
for
anxiety.
The
outcome
can
also
be
“uncertain”
or
within
an
“indeterminate
range”
if the Device cannot provide a high-confidence result.
Study Objectives
This study seeks to evaluate the ability of the Device to aid clinical assessment for depression
and anxiety by comparing its output with the established diagnostic standard consisting of a
diagnosis made by a specialist clinician based on DSM-5 criteria.
This is a prospective study of up to
100
subjects,
ages
>
22 years of age.
We are striving for a 50%/50% split of subjects who have depression and/or anxiety and
subjects who do not have depression and/or anxiety.
16
Study Endpoints
Effectiveness Endpoints
The primary endpoints of this study are to:
1.
Determine the specificity and sensitivity of the Device in discriminating the presence of a
significant depressive episode using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Clinical
Trial Version as the established diagnostic standard (“gold standard”)
2.
Determine the specificity and sensitivity of the Device in discriminating the presence of a
clinically significant anxiety state using the SCID-5-CT as the established diagnostic
standard
The secondary endpoints of this study are:
●
Measurement of the percentage of all adults for whom the Device provided no result
●
Determine the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of the Device
in discriminating the presence
of a significant depressive episode compared to the PHQ-9
●
Determine the specificity and
sensitivity
of the Device
in discriminating the presence of a
clinically significant anxiety state compared to the GAD-7
Safety Endpoints
Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected and reported from
enrollment, which is determined by informed consent signature, through the completion of the
study.
Study Duration
The study is expected to last up to
8
months. The
duration of each individual subject’s
involvement in the study will be approximately 2 hours total consisting of a screening call
followed by a psychiatrist clinical evaluation and online survey. However, participants could be
active on the study for up to 2 weeks to schedule a SCID assessment.
17
Study Design and Procedures
This is a prospective fully remote, decentralized clinical study to measure the sensitivity and
specificity of the Device
predictions against clinical
ground truth for major depressive disorder
and for generalized anxiety disorder. Up to 100 participants
will undergo investigational and
comparator assessments for major depressive disorder and a clinically significant anxiety state.
The research coordinator will schedule a time with the participant for the evaluation. There will
be a two-part evaluation: a web-based study survey and a specialist clinician evaluation via the
SCID assessment. The SCID assessment will include questions about the past medical history
of the participant as well as questions from the Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale.
The order of the two evaluations will be randomized to minimize any potential bias.
The Device output will be positive for depression, negative for depression, or indeterminate for
depression and positive for anxiety, negative for anxiety, or indeterminate for anxiety. PHQ-9
and GAD-7 scores will also be collected through the Study Survey.
Participants will also be evaluated by a specialist clinician via the SCID assessment. The
psychiatrist performing the SCID assessment will be a board-certified psychiatrist. The clinical
evaluation via the SCID assessment will be recorded and the channel-separated audio file of
the participant during this assessment will be used as the Device input. The input for the Device
will be obtained by the clinical research team and will be at least one minute of audio taken from
the SCID assessment where the participant is asked about their current illness history and
treatment history. The results of these assessments will act as the clinical comparator for
comparison with the Device output.
Clinicians and participants will both be blinded to the participant the Device output and the
participant assessment results (SCID, PHQ-9, GAD-7). Further, a SCID reviewer may review the
recorded SCID assessment and standard clinical assessment and completed SCID template to
minimize interrater variability.
Subject Identification and Recruitment, Process of Consent
Subjects may be recruited through various mediums including but not limited to social media,
Craigslist, and/or specialized clinical trial recruitment groups. At the time of enrollment, the
mental status of the participant will not be known. Subjects may be recruited from populations
that self-select as interested in mental health. Potential subjects will be provided with detailed
study information so that they are able to make an informed decision.
If subjects wish to enroll, they will need to answer brief pre-screening questions about the
inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine if they meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Subjects ineligible for the study will be told they do not qualify. Subjects eligible for the study will
receive an informed consent form if they are interested in participating. Participant identity will
be verified before enrollment.
18
Participants will then schedule a time for the SCID assessment and to take the web-based study
survey within the same day. Study participants can choose to end participation in the study at
any time. The clinical research coordinator will also answer any questions on the study that
participants have prior to enrollment.
Participants will also provide basic information such as their physical address, emergency 
contact, age, and email.
Only the necessary participant
information and medical history 
required for the study will be collected.
Recruitment will continue until up to 100 participants have SCID results or until the Sponsor
terminates the study. The Sponsor may collate interim results at any time during the study to
determine whether the study should continue.
Process of Consent
The participant will be given access to the informed consent from. The informed consent form
serves to ensure that participants understand the purpose of the study, assessments the
participants will be asked to undertake as part of the study, the risks and benefits of
participating, and the voluntary nature of their participation. The informed consent form will
inform the participants that they will provide a recording of their voice and video as part of the
study. The informed consent form will also inform the participants that their specialist SCID
assessments conducted over a HIPAA-compliant video-conferencing platform will be recorded
for the purposes of the study and research. A copy of the consent form will be provided to the
participant after they consent. A clinical research coordinator will be available to answer
participant questions about the study.
Randomization
The order in which the online survey and SCID assessment occur will be randomized. All
participants will participate in investigational (Kintsugi Voice Device) and comparator
assessments (SCID assessment, PHQ-9, and GAD-7).
19
A schematic of the study steps is illustrated in Figure 2.
Participants will be considered enrolled once they have signed the informed consent form.
Participants will receive instructions on completing our web-based Study Survey. If the audio
sample from the SCID assessment is not scorable (e.g. poor microphone quality, insufficient
length, excessive background noise), the participant may be asked to submit an additional audio
sample. A clinical research team member will run the audio sample through the Device.
Participants will fill out the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires as part of the Study Survey. The
Device output, PHQ-9, and GAD-7 results will not be shared with the clinicians. Similarly, the
Device output, the PHQ-9, and GAD-7 results will not be shared with the participants.
Participants will complete a SCID assessment immediately after or immediately before the
web-based Study Survey. A clinical research coordinator will be available to support the
participant if they run into issues with the Study Survey.
The SCID assessment will be conducted by a specialist. Specialists will have board certification
in psychiatry and have at least two years of experience diagnosing depressive and anxiety
disorders. Specialists will also undergo psychiatric assessment scoring training for the SCID
assessment prior to providing diagnoses for the study to minimize discrepancies in scoring.
Participants will complete the SCID assessment through a HIPAA compliant teleconferencing
application such as Zoom Meetings. The meeting will be recorded, and the participant will need
to consent to the recording in order to participate in the study. After the SCID assessment, the
specialists will determine a diagnosis based on whether the participant meets the DSM-5 criteria
for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
20

Once the Study Survey (voice sample, PHQ-9, GAD-7) and the specialist-evaluated SCID are
complete, the participant will receive an Amazon gift card of $50 for their time.

Data Collection and Storage
Data will be retained in accordance with federal and institutional policies. Participants will be
assigned a unique participant ID for de-identification. All data for analysis will be identified by
participant ID number instead of personal identifiable information (PII).
The recruitment data with participant names, phone numbers, emails, location, and emergency
contact will be password protected and only accessible to the research team.
Authorized representatives of institutions participating in the study, the Sponsor, the reviewing
IRB and other groups or organizations that have a role in the study including reviewers of the
structured interviews, regulatory bodies (e.g. the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) agencies) will have access to and may view
a participant’s study information. They will be subject to regulations protecting patient
confidentiality (e.g. HIPAA).
The data repository for this study includes:
●
Device input
o
Voice sample provided as an audio recording
●
Device output
●
Video recording of the diagnostic assessment for clinically significant depression and
clinically significant anxiety according to the DSM-5 criteria (SCID)
●
Results from the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaire participant self-assessment
●
Medical history relevant to the inclusion/exclusion criteria
At the conclusion of the study, the data will be retained in accordance with institutional policy.
Identifiable data will be kept for 7 years after the completion of the study. De-identified data will
be kept indefinitely.
23
Potential Risks and Benefits
Potential Risks
Risks related to the study are minimal.
The main potential risk to study participants is loss of confidentiality. Measures to protect the
confidentiality of study participants will be implemented as described in the Data Collection and
Storage section.
Participants may feel discomfort answering questions or being interviewed.
An emergency contact will be collected for each participant, in the rare case that there is
imminent danger to the participant as determined by the psychiatrist and, as stated in the
consent, that 911 may be called if the clinician determines there is an emergency. The clinician
will refer the participant to local resources should there be an emergency but will not provide
ongoing care.
Potential Benefit
Knowledge gained from the study could potentially benefit patients in the future.
Participation in this study might lead to identification of clinically significant depression or
clinically significant anxiety, enabling earlier therapy known to positively impact outcomes.
24
Adverse Events Reporting
Definitions
Term
Definition
Adverse Event (AE)
Any untoward medical occurrence, 
unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory 
findings) in participants, users or other 
persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational Device (ISO 14155-1).
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Adverse event that 
a) Led to death, b) Led to serious 
deterioration in the health of the participant, 
that either resulted in 1) A life-threatening 
illness or injury, or 2) A permanent 
impairment of a body structure or a body 
function, or 3) In-patient or prolonged 
hospitalization, or 4) Medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent life-threatening illness 
or injury or permanent impairment to a body 
structure or a body function, c) Led to fetal 
distress, fetal death or a congenital 
abnormality or birth defect (ISO 14155-1).
Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect 
(ASADE)
An anticipated serious adverse Device effect 
(ASADE) is any SAE on health or safety or 
any life-threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with the Device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, informed 
consent, operator manual, other risk analysis 
documentation or regulatory application; or 
any other serious problem associated with 
a Device that relates to the rights, safety, or 
welfare of subjects.
Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect 
(USADE)
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a Device, if 
that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational 
plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any 
other unanticipated serious problem
25
associated with a Device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of participants 
21 CFR 812.3(s).
Recording of AEs/ADEs and SAEs/SADEs
All suspected adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated and recorded in the participant’s study
case report form. The AEs/ADEs/SAEs/SADEs may be observed by the investigator and/or
clinical research staff or volunteered by the subject. All observed and volunteered adverse signs
and symptoms, anticipated or unanticipated, regardless of severity or frequency will be recorded
in the case histories (i.e. case report form). The reports of the AEs/ADEs/SAEs/SADEs will
include the description of the event of symptom, date of onset, date of resolution, severity,
anticipated or unanticipated, the relationship to the study Device, the action taken (if any), and
the outcome. AEs/ADEs will be reported to the IRB only if the study clinicians, Dr. Herbert J.
Harman and Dr. Roshanak Ramezani, determine that the event is possibly or definitely related
to the Device. All SAEs/SADEs, anticipated or unanticipated, must be reported to the sponsor
and reviewed by the IRB as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the initial
event was recorded. The study clinicians, Dr. Herbert J. Harman and Dr. Roshanak Ramezani,
will review all adverse events to determine the severity and relationship to study Device.
Follow-up of Subjects after AEs
All reported AEs/ADEs/SAEs/SADEs should be followed until resolution of the event or until the
subject’s participation in the study ends. Resolutions of the events should be documented in the
appropriate case report form.
26
Data Analysis Plan
This is a prospective study with up to 100 subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and who do
not meet any of the exclusion criteria.
The analysis set includes all enrolled subjects who provide a sample of their voice and are
evaluated by a specialist. Device-related adverse events will be tabulated and analyzed.
Study Management
Investigator, Clinician, and Research Staff Selection
Investigator(s) and research staff will be invited to participate in the study based on their medical
specialty and experience conducting clinical research studies. Specialists will have board
certification in psychiatry and have at least two years of experience diagnosing depressive and
anxiety disorders.
Training and Monitoring
Investigator(s) and research staff, including clinical research coordinators and clinicians, will be
trained on the study procedures. Clinicians administering the assessment will also receive
training for the SCID to minimize discrepancies in scoring.
Informed Consent
An IRB-approved informed consent document will be provided to subjects through an electronic
signature software tool. Subjects must sign the informed consent document before they can
participate in the Study Survey or participate in a clinician evaluation. Clinical research
coordinators will inform the subjects on the purpose of the study, expected duration, potential
risks and benefits from the study, as well as making it clear that participants are free to refuse
participation in this clinical study.
Participant Withdrawal Criteria
Participation in this study is voluntary and participants can withdraw from the study at any time.
In order to withdraw, a participant will need to:
1.
Call or email the research coordinator.
2.
Let the research coordinator know about their intention to withdraw.
A participant that withdraws from the study prior to completion of study will not be paid.
27
A subject will be considered lost to follow up after 2 unsuccessful attempts to contact the
subject.
If a participant withdraws from the study prior to its completion, their data will not be deleted;
they will still be used for the research study.
Protocol Amendments
Any amendments to this study protocol must be communicated clearly in writing, signed, and
dated by the sponsor and the principal investigator. IRB approval will be obtained for all study
amendments.
Study Discontinuation
The study Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time.
Subject Confidentiality
This study preserves the confidentiality of all subjects under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. The following safeguards will be in place to
protect the privacy of the individuals who are the subjects of the health information to be used in
the research and the confidentiality of that information: The subjects will be informed by the
investigator or the investigator’s designee that their medical records will be kept as confidential
as possible but may be subject to review by: (1) Kintsugi, or its representative; (2) reviewing
IRB; and/or (3) by appropriate regulatory bodies (e.g. the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) agencies).
Only minimum personal information required for purposes of the study will be collected. The
personal information will be collected and used to ensure subject eligibility for study
participation, to conduct the study, and to provide compensation to participants after completion
of the study requirements. Permission to use or disclose personal information, except for that
has been collected and relied on may be canceled by the subject by written notice. If the subject
is withdrawn from the study, the information collected to that time may still be used to preserve
the scientific integrity of the study. There is no expiration date to this authorization.
Subjects’ identities will be kept confidential. Subjects will be assigned a unique study code that
will not reveal the subjects’ identity, and this code will be used on all study documents.
28
Financial Considerations
Subject Compensation:
The participant will be compensated $50 for their participation upon completion of both the
Study Survey (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and the specialist clinical evaluation.
Costs to the Subject:
The specialist clinician evaluation will be covered by the Company sponsoring the study. Any
additional services will not be covered by the sponsor.
Clinician / Specialist Compensation:
Specialist clinicians will be compensated by the clinician evaluations / assessments they
complete. Reviewing specialist clinicians will be compensated per independent review of cases.

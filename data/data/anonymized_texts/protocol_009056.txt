 Summary  of Changes to  the Protocol  
The previous  version  of this protocol  (Version  1.0, 13 August  2019)  was amended  to create  the 
current version (Version 2.0, 12 February 2021). The protocol history is below.  
 
Protocol  History  
Version  and Date  of Protocol  Comments  
Version  1.0, 13 August  2019  Original  version  
Version  2.0, 12 February  2021  Added  the new dose of LUM  75 mg/IVA  94 mg and adjusted  the lower 
weight bound for the LUM 100 mg/IVA 125 mg dose.  
 
Key changes  in the current version  of the  protocol  are summarized below.  
 
Change  and Rationale  Affected  Sections  
Updated  the planned  dosing  regimen  based  on PK results  from 
Study 122 as follows:  
• Added  a lower  dose of LUM  75 mg/IVA  94 mg for subjects 
who weigh 7 to <9 kg at Day 1 for the Rollover Subjects 
and at screening for LUM/IVA -naïve subjects.  
• Updated  the lower  weight  bound  from  10 kg to 9 kg for the 
LUM 100 mg/IVA 125 mg dose  
The planned  dosing  regimen  was also added  to the study 
design figure.  Sections  2 (Figure  2-1), 9.1 (Figure  9-1), 9.6 
(Table  9-2), and 10.3 (Table  10-1) 
Added text to clarify the use of an assessment of Study 122B 
safety data before starting the enrollment of LUM/IVA -naïve 
subjects in each age group. Before initiating enrollment of 
LUM/IVA -naïve subjects 18 to <24 months of age, this safety  
assessment  was performed  in addition  to meeting  the minimum 
enrollment criteria in Study 122B.  Sections  2 (including  Figure  2-1) and 9.1 
(including  Figure  9-1) 
Removed  footnote  “c” from  the “Follow -up OE” in the study 
design figure, as the footnote does not apply to the 
ophthalmologic examination.  Figure  2-1 and Figure  9-1 
Added a ±30 -minute window to the abbreviated physical 
examination  performed  postdose  on Day 1 for the LUM/IVA - 
naïve subjects.  Table  3-2 
Added  a new section  to describe  the use of remote  measures  in 
extenuating circumstances, such as the COVID -19 pandemic.  Section  9.1.6 ; Table  3-1 and Table  3-2 
Added  clarification  that screening  sweat  chloride  results  may 
be reviewed if needed to confirm eligibility.  Section  10.7 
Removed the limitation that only central laboratory results for 
clinical  laboratory  assessments  may be used for data analysis  to 
allow for the use of local laboratories in extenuating 
circumstances, as described in new Section 9.1.6.  Section  11.4.2  
Updated  the analysis  definitions  for “Prior  Medication”  and 
“Pretreatment Adverse  Event  (AE)”  to capture medications 
taken and AEs during Study 122 for the Rollover subjects.  Sections  12.3.2.3  and 12.3.5.1  
 
Typographical  and administrative  changes  were  also made  to improve  the clarity  of the 
document.

Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  5 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 LUM/IVA -naïve Subjects: Subjects who did not participate in Study  122B and are 
12 to <24 months  of age at Study  124 Day  1. These  subjects  will enroll  by age group 
as follows:  
• Subjects who are 18 to <24 months of age can enroll in Study 124 after a 
minimum  of 10 subjects  (aged  18 to <24 months)  have  enrolled  in Study  122B, 
and after an assessment of safety data from Study 122B through Week 12 for  
≥5 subjects  aged  18 to <24 months.  
• Subjects who are 12 to <18 months of age can enroll in Study 124 after a 
minimum  of 10 subjects  (aged  12 to <18 months)  have  enrolled  in Study  122B, 
and after an assessment of safety data from Study 122B through Week 12 for  
≥5 subjects  aged  12 to <18 months.  
Note: Subjects who are 18 to <24 months of age will start enrolling in Study 124 
before  any subjects  who are 12 to <18 months  of age enroll  as a result  of the study 
design in Study 122, which includes sequential age cohorts.  
Rollover and LUM/IVA -naïve subjects will receive LUM/IVA every 12 hours 
(q12h),  according  to a weight -based  dosing  regimen  determined  in Study  122, for up 
to 96 weeks.  
Dose(s) and/or weight bounds may be adjusted after review of safety, tolerability, 
available pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Study 122, as well as any updated 
modeling  approaches  resulting  from  such data.  Changes  to study  drug dose(s)  and/or 
weight bounds will be communicated to site personnel through a memorandum 
entitled “Justification for Dose Selection” to ensure clarity  and consistency in study 
conduct.  
During  the treatment  period,  doses  may also be adjusted  upward  based  on consistent 
weight gain; however, no downward dose adjustments will be made if a subject’s 
weight decreases.  
 
Assessments  Safety:  AEs,  clinical  laboratory  (serum  chemistry  and hematology),  standard 
12-lead ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical examinations, and OEs  
Pharmacodynamic:  Sweat  chloride  
Exploratory: BMI, BMI -for-age z -score, weight, weight -for-age z -score, 
length/height,  length/height -for-age z-score,  weight -for-length -for-age z-score,  
FE-1, IRT, and fecal  calprotectin  
 
Statistical Analyses  No formal sample size calculations have been performed. The study will enroll 
approximately  50 subjects  to provide  data for the assessment  of long-term safety  in 
the target patient population, as requested by a regulatory agency.  
Data from all safety, pharmacodynamic (PD), and exploratory endpoints will be 
analyzed  using  descriptive  statistics.  Raw and change  from  baseline  values  will be 
summarized descriptively for the continuous endpoints; number of subjects and 
percentages will be summarized for the categorical endpoints.  
 
IDMC Reviews  Data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to 
ensure the safety of the subjects in the study. Procedural details of the IDMC's 
structure  and function,  frequency  of meetings,  and data planned  for review  will be 
included in the IDMC charter, which will be finalized before the first subject is 
enrolled.

 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating 
morbidities and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. CF is caused by a 
defect in the gene encoding CFTR, an epithelial chloride ion channel that is responsible for 
aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues.1 This 
function  is abnormal  in patients  with CF due to a loss of cell surface  expression  and/or  function 
of CFTR. CF affects more than 78,000 individuals worldwide.2, 3 Despite progress in the 
treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a 
person with CF is approximately 40 years.4, 5 Although the disease affects multiple organs, 
progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality.6 
Approximately  half of the total CF patient  population  is <18 years  of age.2, 3, 7, 8 In the US, 58.4% 
of all new diagnoses are detected by newborn screening.2 Early diagnosis has been associated 
with better outcomes later in life.9 Pancreatic destruction leading to pancreatic exocrine 
insufficiency begins in utero, with over 90% of homozygous F508del infants demonstrating 
pancreatic insufficiency requiring pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). Lung 
involvement is primarily manifested by changes in airway surface liquid height leading to 
impaired mucociliary clearance and subsequent neutrophilic airway inflammation, bacterial 
colonization, and infection leading to structural lung damage that begins shortly after birth.10, 11 
CFTR modulators, such as lumacaftor (LUM; VX -809)/ivacaftor (IVA; VX -770) combination 
therapy  (Orkambi ™), target  the underlying  cause  of CF and have  the potential  to alter the course 
of the disease. LUM/IVA is the first medicine designed to treat the underlying molecular defect 
and enhance the function of CFTR in patients homozygous for F508del . The LUM/IVA 
development program is designed to support the hypothesis that an oral chronic treatment 
restoring  CFTR function can lead to improved pulmonary  and extrapulmonary  manifestations of 
CF, prevent progressive lung damage, and ultimately prolong survival.  
Details  about  the LUM/IVA  development  program  can be found  in the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
5.2 Study  Rationale  
The primary  objectives of Study  VX16 -809-122 (Study  122) are to obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and safety  information  to support  a proposed  indication  expansion  of LUM/IVA  in subjects  12 to  
<24 months  of age with CF, homozygous  for F508del . The primary  objective  of 
Study VX19 -809-124 (Study 124, the current study) is to evaluate the long -term safety of 
LUM/IVA  in subjects  12 to  <24 months  of age with CF, homozygous  for F508del , at the time of 
treatment initiation.  
6 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
6.1 Primary  Objective  
To evaluate  the safety  and tolerability  of long-term LUM/IVA  treatment  in subjects  with CF, 
who are homozygous for F508del and 12 to <24 months of age at treatment initiation

o Subjects must be homozygous for F508del (genotype to be confirmed at screening): 
If a genotype test has been performed previously and is documented in the subject’s 
medical record, the subject is not required to be tested for CFTR genotype at 
screening, but the subject’s eligibility must be approved by the Vertex medical 
monitor. If a historic genotype result is not available at screening or if the historic 
genotype result is not approved by the Vertex medical monitor, the subject will be 
tested for CFTR genotype at screening, and the results must be reviewed before the

9 STUDY  IMPLEMENTATION  
9.1 Study  Design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label study  in subjects who are 12 to <24 months of age at 
initiation  of LUM/IVA  treatment  (Figure  9-1). The study  will enroll  approximately  50 subjects.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  22 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 
Figure  9-1 Study  124 Design  
 
 
IVA:  ivacaftor;  LUM:  lumacaftor;  OE: ophthalmological  examination;  q12h:  every  12 hours;  wks:  weeks  
a LUM/IVA naïve subjects (by age group: 18 to <24 months and 12 to <18 months) will be able to enroll in 
Study  124 once minimum  enrollment  has been  met for Study  122B  (n = 10 subjects  in each age group)  and 
after an assessment of safety data from Study 122B through Week 12 for ≥5 subjects in each age group.  
b For Rollover  Subjects,  the Day 1 Visit  should  be the same  day as the Safety  Follow -up Visit  in Study  122B.  
c The Safety  Follow -up Visit  will not be required  for subjects  transitioning  to commercial  LUM/IVA 
(Section 9.1.3 ). 
d For LUM/IVA -naïve  subjects,  doses  will be determined  by weight  at screening.  
 
Rollover  Subjects  
Subjects  who participated  in Study  122B  and meet  all eligibility  requirements  will rollover into 
Study 124.  
Timing  of Day 1 Visit  
For rollover  subjects  at sites activated  by the Study  122B  Safety  Follow -up Visit,  their Study  124 
Day 1 Visit will be on the same day as their Study  122B Safety  Follow -up Visit. Any  Study  124 
Day 1 assessments that are specified to be performed at the Study 122B Safety Follow -up Visit 
do not need to be repeated.  
If the  Study  124 Day 1 Visit does  not coincide  with the Study  122B  Safety  Follow -up Visit,  and 
if Study  124 Day  1 is ≤9 days after the Study  122B  Safety  Follow -up Visit, the Study  124 Day  1 
assessments do not need to be repeated. If Study 124 Day 1 is >9 days after the Study 122B 
Safety Follow -up Visit, the subject will complete all Study 124 Day 1 assessments (except the 
OE if it was performed ≤12 weeks before the Study 124 Day 1 Visit).  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  23 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 LUM/IVA -naïve  Subjects  
Subjects  who did not participate  in Study  122B  and are  12 to <24 months  of age at Study  124 
Day 1 can enroll by age group:  
• Subjects  who are  18 to <24 months  of age  can enroll in Study  124 after a  minimum of 
10 subjects  (aged  18 to <24 months)  have  enrolled  in Study  122B,  and after an assessment  of 
safety data from Study 122B through Week 12 for ≥5 subjects aged 18 to <24 months.  
• Subjects  who are  12 to  <18 months  of age  can enroll in Study  124 after a  minimum of 
10 subjects  (aged  12 to <18 months)  have  enrolled  in Study  122B,  and after an assessment  of 
safety data from Study 122B through Week 12 for ≥5 subjects aged 12 to <18 months.  
Note:  Subjects  18 to <24 months of age  will start enrolling  in Study  124 before  any subjects  
12 to <18 months  of age enroll  as a result  of the staggered  timing  as a result  of the study  design 
in Study 122, which includes sequential age cohorts.  
9.1.1  Screening  (LUM/IVA -naïve  Subjects  Only)  
Screening  Visit  assessments  are listed  in Table  3-2. 
Screening  will occur  within  28 days before  administration  of LUM/IVA.  The investigator  (or an 
appropriate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain informed consent from each 
subject’s parent or legal guardian.  
To prepare  for study  participation,  subject’s  parent  or legal  guardian  will be instructed  on the 
study restrictions (Section 9.4). 
9.1.1.1  Repetition  of Screening  Assessment(s)  
Repetition  of any screening  assessment  that did not meet  eligibility  criteria  is not permitted,  with 
the following exceptions:  
• If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolyzed sample), equipment 
malfunction,  or technician  error,  collection  of a repeat  sample  for the appropriate  laboratory 
test may be permitted after discussion with the Vertex medical monitor or authorized 
designee.  
• Exclusionary  LFT levels,  which  may be retested  within  14 days  of the original  Screening 
Visit date.  
• If an adequate  slit-lamp  examination  could  not be conducted  (Section  11.4.6 ). 
• If QTc exceeds 450 msec at screening (see Section 8.2.2 , exclusion criterion 5), the ECG 
should  be repeated  2 more  times  during  the Screening  Period,  and the average  of the 3 QTc 
values should be used to determine the subject’s eligibility.  
If repeat  values  of the individual  assessment(s)  are within  the eligibility  criteria  and completed 
within  the Screening  Period  window or  extended  screening  window  (Section 9.1.1.2 ), then the 
subject is eligible for the study.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  24 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 9.1.1.2  Extension  of Screening  Period  Window  
A subject  may have  the Screening  Period  window extended by  2 weeks  after approval  by the 
medical monitor or authorized designee for the following reasons:  
• Repetition  of the Screening  Period  assessments  (Section 9.1.1.1 ) 
• Unexpected  operational  or logistical  delays (e.g., delayed  drug shipment)  
• To account  for exclusionary  events  that may not reflect  the subject’s  true baseline  due to an 
acute event, which may resolve  
• Scheduling  of the OE  (Section  11.4.6 ) 
• Availability  or malfunction  of required equipment  or technician  error  
The screening  window  can be extended  by 4 weeks  if a slit-lamp  examination  must  be repeated 
(Section 9.1.1.1  and Section 11.4.6 ). 
9.1.1.3  Rescreening  
Subjects may be rescreened after discussion with the Vertex medical monitor or authorized 
designee; all rescreening requires Vertex approval. If a  subject is rescreened, all Screening  Visit 
assessments  will be repeated  except  for CFTR genotyping,  sweat  chloride  testing,  and the OE (if 
performed  within  the last 3 months  before  the Screening  Visit).  Subjects  may only be rescreened 
once. If a subject is rescreened, the new screening window date will begin once the first 
rescreening assessment has been initiated.  
9.1.2  Treatment  Period  
Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table 3 -1 for Rollover Subjects and Error! 
Reference  source  not found.  for LUM/IVA -naïve  Subjects . Subjects  will be outpatients  during 
the Treatment Period. All visits and telephone contacts should occur within the windows 
specified.  
The Treatment  Period  is 96 weeks;  LUM/IVA  will be administered  every  12 hours  (q12h)  from 
Day 1 up to Week 96. LUM/IVA dose and administration details are provided in Section 9.6. 
Procedures  for subjects  who prematurely  discontinue  LUM/IVA  treatment  are described  in 
Section 9.1.4 . 
9.1.3  Follow -up 
Safety Follow -up Visit  
Subjects  will have  a Safety  Follow -up Visit  2 weeks  (± 4 days)  after the last dose of study  drug. 
Safety  Follow -up Visit  assessments  are listed  in Table  3-1 for the Rollover  Subjects  and Error! 
Reference source not found. for the LUM/IVA -naïve Subjects.  
The Safety  Follow -up Visit is  required for: 
• Subjects  who complete  their Early  Termination  of Treatment  (ETT)  Visit  <10 days  after the 
last dose of LUM/IVA (Section 9.1.4 ) 
• Subjects  who interrupt  LUM/IVA  treatment  and complete  their Week 96  Visit  <10 days after 
the last dose of LUM/IVA  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  25 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 The Safety Follow -up Visit is not required for subjects who continue onto commercially 
available,  physician -prescribed  LUM/IVA  within  2 weeks  (± 4 days)  of completing  LUM/IVA 
treatment at the Week 96 or ETT Visit . 
Follow -up Ophthalmological  Examination  
Subjects  will have  a Follow -up OE  24 weeks  (± 14 days) after  the last dose  of study  drug.  
9.1.4  Early  Termination of  Treatment  OR Early  Discontinuation  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue LUM/IVA treatment will be asked to complete the ETT 
Visit as soon as possible after their last dose, to remain on study, and to complete the study 
assessments from the time of LUM/IVA treatment discontinuation through the Week 96 Visit 
and the Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable. The assessments to be completed are shown in 
Table 3 -1 and Table 3 -2. If the ETT Visit occurs ≥10 days after the last dose of LUM/IVA, then 
a Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required. Additional safety assessments may also be 
performed at the discretion of the investigator, including possible consultation with a specialist 
consultant.  The Vertex  medical  monitor  will be informed  about  these  additional  assessments,  and 
any additional data collected (e.g., as the result of an outside consultation) will be considered  
part of the study record to provide the most complete safety profile of the study drug.  
Subjects  who become  eligible  to receive  commercially  available  LUM/IVA  by prescription  from 
a physician and who choose to continue onto commercially available LUM/IVA before 
completion of the study must remain on study -supplied LUM/IVA through the ETT Visit and 
may only initiate  treatment  with commercially  available  LUM/IVA  after completion  of this visit. 
Subjects who continue onto commercially available LUM/IVA will complete the Follow -up OE 
24 weeks (± 14 days) after the last dose of study drug.  
9.1.5  Independent  Data  Monitoring  Committee  
Safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee 
(IDMC)  to ensure  the safety  of the subjects  (Section  12.3.6.2 ). Procedural  details  of the IDMC’s 
structure and function, frequency  of meetings, and data planned for review will be in the IDMC 
charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is enrolled.  
9.1.6  Use of Remote  Measures  in Extenuating  Circumstances  
Study  visits should be performed in the clinic as specified in Table 3 -1 or Table 3 -2, if at all 
possible. However, under extenuating circumstances, remote measures may be implemented 
(e.g., if a subject is unable to travel to the study site due to safety concerns and/or local 
restrictions  related  to COVID -19 or other  emerging  events).  The decision  whether  to conduct 
study visits remotely or in clinic will be at the discretion of the investigator.  
Whenever  local  regulations  or site practice  do not allow  remote  measures,  visits  will be 
conducted at the site.  
Remote  measures  that may be implemented  include, but are  not limited to: 
• Consent  or reconsent  may be obtained  remotely  in writing  (or verbally,  with follow -up 
written confirmation), as allowed by local regulations.  
• Study  drug may be shipped  directly  from  the site to the subject,  as applicable  and as allowed 
by local regulations.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  26 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 • Study  visits  may be conducted as  in-home visits  by qualified  personnel.  
• Study  assessments  may be performed  or overseen  by qualified  personnel  conducting  the 
in-home visits.  
• Remote  monitoring  visits  may be implemented  as applicable  (including  remote  source  data 
verification) and as allowed per local regulations  
• Blood  samples  for safety  assessments  may be collected and  analyzed by  local laboratories.  
• Weight  and stature  may be assessed  by the subject’s  caregivers  using  medical grade  scales 
and stadiometers.  
9.2 Method  of Assigning  Subjects  to Treatment  Groups  
This is an open -label  study.  
9.3 Rationale  for Study  Elements  
9.3.1  Study  Design  
Vertex has established efficacy, safety, and PK profiles for LUM/IVA in subjects 2 years of age 
and older with CF, homozygous for F508del (Studies 103, 104, 109, and 115). Because the 
underlying genetic and molecular etiology of the disease is identical between younger and older 
patients,  and the impact  of CFTR  protein  dysfunction  is likely  to be comparable,  extrapolation  of 
efficacy from older to younger patients is appropriate, and PK studies in younger patients, 
together with safety studies, can provide adequate information for use.14 
Safety  and PK profiles for LUM/IVA have been established in subjects aged 2 years and older 
with CF, homozygous for F508del (Study  115). Study  122, a Phase 3, 2 -part open -label study, 
which includes a 24 -week Treatment Period in Part B, is designed to obtain PK and safety 
information  to support  a proposed  indication  expansion  of LUM/IVA  in subjects  who are 12 to 
<24 months  of age with CF, homozygous  for F508del.  
Long -term safety and efficacy was established in subjects aged 6 years and older with CF, 
homozygous  for F508del,  in Study  110, the open -label  rollover  study  for parent  Studies  109 and 
011B. Evaluation of long -term safety in subjects aged 2 years and older with CF, homozygous 
for F508del , is currently ongoing in Study 116, the open -label rollover study for parent  
Study  115. 
Study 124 is a Phase 3, open -label, multicenter study in subjects with CF, homozygous for 
F508del , who are 12 to <24 months  of age when  LUM/IVA  treatment  is initiated.  This study, 
which includes a 96 -week Treatment Period, is designed to evaluate the long -term safety of 
LUM/IVA when treatment is initiated between 12 and 24 months of age.  
9.3.2  Study  Drug Dose and Duration  
Dose  of LUM/IVA  
Study  122 Part A (Study  122A)  was designed  to characterize  the safety  and PK  of LUM  and IVA 
in subjects 12 through <24 months of age. The plasma concentration versus time data from  
Study 122A is intended to inform the appropriateness or necessary adjustment of planned doses 
for Studies 122B and 124. As data from Study 122B become available, the doses may be 
modified for subjects in Study  124. A population PK model with allometric scaling of clearance 
and volume of distribution as a function of weight was used to project exposures of LUM and  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  27 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 IVA for comparison  with clinical  experiences  with both drugs  and to select  doses  to be evaluated 
in this study population. No safety issues were identified in prior clinical or nonclinical studies 
that would preclude the dosing regimen proposed for Study 124.  
Duration  of Dosing  
Subjects  who receive  LUM/IVA  in Study  124 may receive  treatment  for up to 120 weeks  (for 
Rollover Subjects: 24 weeks in Study  122B and 96 weeks in Study  124; for LUM/IVA -naïve 
Subjects: 96 weeks in Study 124), thus providing information on the long -term safety of 
LUM/IVA in subjects aged 1 year and older with CF, homozygous for F508del . 
9.3.3  Study  Assessments  
The safety assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in drug development and are 
generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of subjects with CF. OEs 
were added as part of safety monitoring. Assessments were added to evaluate the PD effects of 
LUM/IVA. The following  PD and efficacy -related assessments are standard assessments used in 
studies  in the LUM/IVA  development  program:  sweat  chloride  and growth  parameters,  including 
weight, length, and BMI. Rationale is provided below for OEs and additional assessments 
(exocrine pancreatic function and markers of intestinal inflammation).  
Ophthalmological  Examinations:  A juvenile  rat toxicity  study  performed  to support  dosing  of 
IVA in subjects <2 years of age demonstrated lens opacities in some animals.15 Prior studies in 
rats and dogs of older age did not demonstrate similar findings. Given substantial differences 
between human and rat lens development, the finding is of unlikely relevance to humans.  
Periodic  OEs for pediatric  subjects  receiving  IVA or IVA in combination  with a CFTR  corrector 
are being performed to confirm this interpretation. The overall data acquired to date does not 
suggest an association between IVA treatment and cataract development.  
Exocrine Pancreatic Function:  The pancreas is 1 of the earliest and most seriously affected 
organs  in patients  with CF who are homozygous  for F508del,  the vast majority  of whom  develop 
pancreatic insufficiency.  
• FE-1: FE-1 is a diagnostic  measure  of pancreatic  exocrine  sufficiency,  with levels  <200 µg/g 
considered consistent with pancreatic insufficiency. The increasing use of FE -1 in the clinic 
is a result of the ease of collecting samples (relative to other methods, e.g. 24 -hour fecal fat) 
for its assessment and the establishment of diagnostic cutoffs for pancreatic exocrine 
function.16 FE-1 represents a feasible measure to evaluate exocrine pancreatic function 
during the study, with the hypothesis that treatment with LUM/IVA may rescue a degree of 
pancreatic function, resulting in increased FE -1 levels over the course of the study.  
• IRT: Trypsin and trypsinogen are proteins produced by the pancreas that can be detected in 
the blood via the IRT assay. Evaluation of IRT is used in clinical practice as the basis of 
newborn screening for CF, wherein elevated levels at birth are associated with disease. Over 
time,  however,  patients  with CF show  a longitudinal  decline  in IRT with nondetectable  levels 
observed around  5 years of age, indicating  a loss of pancreatic  function.17 Blood samples  for 
IRT testing  will be collected at multiple time points to evaluate potential changes in exocrine 
pancreatic function.  
Markers  of Intestinal  Inflammation:  Fecal  samples  will be collected  to investigate  biomarkers 
related to intestinal inflammation in CF patients, including but not limited to fecal calprotectin. 
Fecal calprotectin has been shown to be increased in pediatric patients with CF.18 These data  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  28 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 support the concept that intestinal inflammation is a feature of CF and that intestinal 
inflammation  can be monitored  by measuring  non-invasive  biomarkers  such as fecal  calprotectin 
in clinical studies with CF patients.  
9.4 Study  Restrictions  
Prohibited  medications  and certain  foods are  not allowed  as summarized  in Table  9-1. 
A non-exhaustive  list of study  prohibitions  and cautions  for food and medication  will be 
provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
Table  9-1 Study  Restrictions  
Study  Period  
 
 
Restricted  Medication/Food  Screening  Period  Treatment  Period  
Strong  CYP3A  inducers  None  allowed  within  14 days before  
the first dose of LUM/IVA  
Strong  CYP3A  inhibitors  None  allowed  within  14 days before  
the first dose of LUM/IVA  None allowed 
Use with caution  
IVA:  ivacaftor;  LUM:  lumacaftor  
Note:  The use of restricted medication  in subjects  with a medical  need will  be addressed  on a case-by-case basis 
with the medical monitor or authorized designee.  
 
Use of CYP3A  substrates  is not prohibited,  but investigators  need  to be aware  that LUM  appears 
to be a strong inducer of CYP3A. Therefore, the efficacy of drugs extensively metabolized by 
CYP3A may be affected.  
Use of CYP2C and CYP2B6 substrates is not prohibited, but investigators need to be aware that 
LUM  has been  shown  in vitro  to induce  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  and CYP2C19;  inhibition 
of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 has also been observed in vitro. Additionally, in vitro studies suggest 
that IVA may inhibit CYP2C9. Therefore, concomitant use of LUM/IVA with CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates may alter the exposure of these substrates.  
Each investigator should evaluate the benefit -risk ratio of using CYP3A, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9,  and CYP2C19  substrates  with LUM  and IVA  and discuss  their use with the medical 
monitor or authorized designee.  
9.5 Prior  and Concomitant  Medications  
Information regarding all prior and concomitant medications, including the subject’s CF 
medications,  other  medications,  and herbal  and naturopathic  remedies  administered  from  28 days 
before the first dose through the Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable, will be recorded in each 
subject’s source documents. In addition, concomitant medication dose(s) may be collected.  
• It is recommended that subjects remain on a stable medication regimen for their CF from 
28 days before Day 1 through the Safety  Follow -up Visit, if applicable. Stable medication 
regimen is defined as the current medication regimen for CF that subjects have been 
following  for at least 28 days  before  Day 1. Note:  PERT  doses  may be adjusted  during  this 
study.  
• While  the etiology  of respiratory  events  associated  with LUM/IVA  is not yet known,  data 
from healthy subjects in Study 009 Cohort 4 suggest that treatment with short -acting  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  29 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 bronchodilators may reverse the initial transient decline in percent predicted forced  
expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV 1) when dosed with LUM/IVA. Subjects may be 
prescribed  a short -acting  bronchodilator  in accordance  with local  drug labeling  (if not already 
prescribed) to ensure constant availability during the study.  
• Information  about  bronchodilator  use during  the study  will be collected  and documented  in 
the subject’s source documents.  
9.6 Administration  
LUM/IVA  will be administered  orally  according  to the planned  doses  and weight  bounds  shown 
in Table 9 -2. Changes to study drug dose(s) and/or weight bounds based on results from  
Study  122 may be communicated  to site personnel  through  a memorandum  entitled  “Justification 
for Dose Selection.”  
Table  9-2 Study  Drug  Administration:  Planned  Doses  
 
Dose  Subject’s  Weighta Time  LUM/IVA  
(Number  of Stick  Packs)  
 
LUM  75 mg/IVA  94 mg q12h  7 to <9kg  AM 1 stick  pack 
PM 1 stick  pack 
LUM  100 mg/IVA  125 mg q12h  9 to <14 kg AM 1 stick  pack 
PM 1 stick  pack 
LUM  150 mg/IVA  188 mg q12h  ≥14 kg AM 1 stick  pack 
PM 1 stick  pack 
IVA:  ivacaftor;  LUM:  lumacaftor;  q12h:  every  12 hours  
a Doses  may be adjusted  upward  based  on weight  gain;  however,  no downward  dose adjustments  will be made  if 
a subject’s weight decreases. For example, if a subject weighs <14 kg at screening and subsequently weighs  
≥14 kg at 2 consecutive  study  visits,  the dose will  be adjusted  to LUM  150 mg/IVA  188 mg q12h  at the second 
study visit when weight ≥14 kg.  
 
LUM/IVA  will be administered  within  30 minutes  from  the start of consuming  fat-containing 
food such as a standard “CF” high -fat, high -calorie meal or snack according to the following 
guidelines:  
1. All doses  of LUM/IVA  (morning  and evening,  as applicable)  should  be administered  at 
approximately q12h (± 2 hours) on each dosing occasion (e.g., if the morning dose is 
administered at 08:00 on Day 1, all subsequent morning doses should be administered 
between 06:00 and 10:00).  
2. The granule  formulation  will be dispensed  by opening  the stick  packs  containing  the granules 
and mixing the granules with the approved foods and liquids listed in the Study Reference 
Manual. Each dose  will be  composed of the approved food or liquids  into which the granules 
from the stick packs are mixed. Details on preparing LUM/IVA will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
3. At the Day 1 Visit,  all LUM/IVA -naïve  subjects  will be observed  for 4 hours  after the 
LUM/IVA dose.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  30 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 4. On days of scheduled visits, with the exception of afternoon visits addressed below, the 
morning  LUM/IVA  dose will be administered  at the site after any predose  assessments  have 
been completed.  
5. If a subject’s  scheduled  visit is to occur  in the afternoon,  the following  guidelines  must  be 
used for administering either the morning or evening dose:  
• If the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject’s scheduled morning 
LUM/IVA  dose,  the subject  should  withhold  their morning  dose and the morning  dose 
will be administered in the clinic.  
• If the dose in the clinic will be more than 6 hours after the subject’s scheduled morning 
LUM/IVA  dose,  the subject  should  take the morning  dose at home  and the evening  dose 
will be administered  in the clinic.  In this event,  all assessments  will be collected  relative 
to the evening dose.  
6. For visits after the Day 1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused 
LUM/IVA  materials  to the site; LUM/IVA  will be dispensed  at each visit,  as appropriate.  
At the Week  96 Visit,  the LUM/IVA  dose will NOT  be administered.  The last LUM/IVA  dose 
will be the previous dose (e.g., evening dose) administered before the Week 96 Visit.  
9.7 Dose  Modification  for Toxicity  
Modifications  of the LUM/IVA  dose are prohibited.  Should  any unacceptable  toxicity  arise, 
individual subjects will be withdrawn from the study treatment.  
9.8 Study  Drug Interruptions  
If study  drug dosing must be interrupted for more than 72 hours, the Vertex medical monitor 
must  be notified. In  these  instances,  study  drug dosing  may resume  only after approval  by the 
Vertex medical monitor. Specific instructions on interruption for elevated LFT levels are 
provided in Section 11.4.3 . 
9.9 Removal  of Subjects  
Subjects  may withdraw  from  the study  at any  time at the request  of the parent  or legal  guardian. 
Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or 
administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject 
will continue to be followed as described in Section 9.1.4 , provided that the subject’s parent or 
legal guardian has not withdrawn consent.  
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the 
subject’s parent or legal guardian. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to 
document  subject  outcome.  The investigator  will inquire  about  the reason  for withdrawal,  request 
that the subject’s parent or legal guardian return all unused investigational product(s), request  
that the subject return for a Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.3 ), and  
follow  up with the subject’s  parent  or legal guardian  regarding  any unresolved  AEs.  
If the subject’s parent or legal guardian withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations 
should be  performed, and no additional data should be  collected. Vertex may  retain and continue 
using  the study  data and samples  after the study  is over  and may use the samples  and information 
in the development of the study compound, and for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  31 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 and presentations,  and for education  purposes. If  the subject’s  parent  or legal  guardian  withdraws 
the subject from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A 
subject’s parent or legal guardian will not be able to request the withdrawal of the subject’s 
information from the study data. A subject’s parent or legal guardian may request destruction of 
the samples  collected  from  the subject  during  the study  as long as those  samples  can be identified 
as the subject’s samples.  
9.10 Replacement  of Subjects  
Subjects  who withdraw  or are withdrawn  during  the study  drug Treatment  Period  will not be 
replaced.  
10 STUDY  DRUG  INFORMATION  AND  MANAGEMENT  
10.1 Preparation  and Dispensing  
LUM/IVA  may be dispensed  only under  the supervision  of the investigator  or an authorized 
designee and only for administration to the study subjects.  
10.2 Packaging  and Labeling  
Vertex will supply the LUM/IVA granules in stick packs. Study drug labeling will be in 
compliance  with applicable  local  and national  regulations.  Additional  details  about  packaging,

10.4 Drug  Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information about the dates and 
amounts  of (1) study  drug received;  (2) study  drug dispensed  to the subjects; and  (3) study  drug 
returned  by the subject’s  parent  or legal  guardian.  The subject’s  parent  or legal  guardian  will be 
instructed to return all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site.  
These  materials  will be  retained  at the  site according  to instructions  provided  by Vertex  or its 
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  32 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 designee. The  study  monitor will review study  drug records and inventory  throughout the study. 
If a site uses a site -specific drug accountability system and/or process, including processes 
associated with the destruction of returned materials, the process must be documented and 
approved  by Vertex.  The study  monitor  must  review  the drug accountability  documentation  on a 
regular  basis. The  study  monitor will promptly  communicate to Vertex any  discrepancies  he/she 
is unable to resolve with the site.  
10.5 Disposal,  Return,  or Retention  of Unused  Drug  
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subject’s 
parent or legal guardian until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The 
investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable 
environmental  regulations,  institutional  policy,  and any special  instructions  provided  by Vertex. 
Destruction will be adequately documented.  
10.6 Compliance  
To ensure  treatment  compliance,  the investigator  or designee  will supervise  all study  drug dosing 
that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with 
study drug dosing and remind the subject’s parent or legal guardian of study drug dosing 
requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count.  
If there is continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational efforts, the 
investigator  should  contact  the medical  monitor  to discuss  discontinuation  of the subject  from  the 
study treatment.  
10.7 Blinding and  Unblinding  
This is an open -label  study.  
However,  the site and the subject’s  parent  or legal  guardian  should  not be informed  of a subject’s 
study -related sweat chloride (except if needed to confirm eligibility), IRT, FE -1, and markers of 
intestinal inflammation results during the study even if the subject permanently discontinued 
treatment.  
11 ASSESSMENTS  
The schedule  of assessments  is shown  in Table  3-1 for Rollover  Subjects  and Table  3-2 for 
LUM/IVA -naïve Subjects.  
11.1 Subject  and Disease  Characteristics  
Subject  and disease  characteristics  include  the following:  demographics,  medical  history,  height, 
and weight.  
For Rollover Subjects, medical history will be taken from Study 122B. For LUM/IVA -naive 
Subjects, medical history will be elicited from each subject’s parent or legal guardian during 
screening. Based on the medical history, the subject will be assessed for any disqualifying 
medical conditions as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history 
should  include  a complete  review  of systems,  past medical  and surgical  histories,  and any known 
allergies.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  33 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 In addition,  the following  historical  data will be collected  from  birth  to screening  (for all 
subjects):  
• Maternal/pregnancy  history:  complications  in pregnancy,  gestational  age at delivery,  method 
of delivery, and presence of meconium ileus (if documented in subject’s clinical chart)  
• Routine/quarterly  CF clinic  visit measurements  for length/height  and weight.  Note: 
Measurements taken during sick visits or hospitalizations will not be collected.  
• The dates  and indications  for all CF-related  hospitalizations  
• Any use (yes or no) of  the following  medications:  
o Inhaled  antibiotics  (e.g.,  tobramycin,  aztreonam,  or colimycin)  
o Nebulized  hypertonic  saline (any  %) 
o Nebulized  dornase  alfa 
o Oral azithromycin (anti -inflammatory  dosing  M/W/F)  
• Historical  pancreatic  status  measurements  (e.g.,  prior  FE-1 levels)  
In addition,  the subject’s  parent  or legal  guardian  will be asked  during  screening  to provide  the 
height of the subject’s biological parents.  
11.2 Pharmacodynamics  
11.2.1  Sweat Chloride  
Collection of sweat samples will be performed using an approved collection device. Sweat 
samples will be sent to a central laboratory for testing and interpretation of results. Specific 
instructions  for collection,  handling,  processing,  and shipping  of sweat  chloride  samples  to the 
central  laboratory  will be provided  separately.  At each  time point,  2 samples  will be  collected, 
1 sample from each arm (left and right).  
11.3 Exploratory  Assessments  
11.3.1  Growth Parameters  
Weight  and length/height  will be assessed  and BMI  will be derived.  Length/height  and weight 
must be measured with the subject in a dry diaper or dry underclothes only. If the subject is  
>2 years of age and can stand unassisted and follow directions, standing height should be 
measured; otherwise recumbent length should be measured. Length should be measured while 
the subject  is supine  by measuring  from  the crown  of the head  to the bottom  of the feet, with the 
hips and legs straightened. BMI will be calculated using the following equation:  
BMI  (kg/m2) = body  weight  (kg) ÷ stature2 (m2). Z-scores  adjusting  for age and sex in weight, 
length/height, and BMI, as well as weight -for-length z -score will be derived. Formulas for 
calculating z -scores will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
11.3.2  Measures  of Pancreatic  Function  
11.3.2.1  Fecal  Elastase -1 
Fecal samples  for assessment of  FE-1 may  be collected at the  study  site during  the study  visit or 
by the subject’s  caregiver  up to 48 hours  before  the study  visit (e.g.,  at home)  and brought  to the 
study  visit.  For the LUM/IVA -naïve  subjects,  the sample  collected  before  the first dose of study  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  34 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 drug can either be collected at screening or up to 48 hours before the Day 1 study visit (as 
described  in Table  3-2). Specific  instructions  for the collection,  processing,  and shipment  of 
samples will be provided in a separate Laboratory Manual.  
11.3.2.2  Immunoreactive  Trypsin  and Trypsinogen  
Specific  instructions  for the collection,  processing,  and shipment  of blood  samples  for 
assessment of IRT will be provided in a separate Laboratory Manual.  
11.3.3  Markers  of Intestinal  Inflammation  
Fecal  samples  for assessment  of fecal  calprotectin  (and other  markers  of intestinal  inflammation, 
if applicable) may be collected at the study site during the study visit or by the subject’s 
caregiver up to 48 hours before the study  visit (e.g., at home) and brought to the study  visit. For 
the LUM/IVA -naïve subjects, the sample collected before the first dose of study  drug can either 
be collected at screening or up to 48 hours before the Day 1 study visit (as described in  
Table  3-2). Specific  instructions  for the collection,  processing,  and shipment  of samples  will be 
provided in a separate Laboratory Manual.  
11.4 Safety  
Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments (serum chemistry and 
hematology),  clinical  evaluation  of vital signs,  pulse  oximetry,  standard  12-lead ECGs,  physical 
examinations, and OEs.  
11.4.1  Adverse  Events  
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH GCP Guidelines. 
Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for 
documenting,  grading,  and reporting  AEs.  A separate  document  that details  AE CRF  completion 
guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided.  
11.4.2  Clinical  Laboratory  Assessments  
Blood samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory. Although blood samples are to be 
analyzed  at a central  laboratory,  a local  laboratory  may be used if a subject  cannot  return  to the 
clinical study site for the mandatory liver function testing (Section 11.4.3 ). 
Blood samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected as shown in Table 3 -1 and 
Table  3-2. Laboratory  test results  that are abnormal  and considered  clinically  significant  will be 
reported as AEs (Section 13.1).

Clinical  laboratory  assessments  from  screening  (for LUM/IVA -naïve  subjects)  will have  no 
clinically significant findings that preclude participation in the study, as judged by the 
investigator, for a subject to receive LUM/IVA on Day 1.  
CF Genotype  (Screening  Period  for LUM/IVA -naïve  subjects  only) : If a historic  genotype  result 
is not available at screening or if the historic genotype result is not approved by the Vertex 
medical monitor, CF genotyping will be performed on a subject to confirm the subject is 
homozygous for F508del . Note: Newborn screening genotype results are not sufficient for 
eligibility.  
Additional  Evaluations : Additional  clinical  laboratory  evaluations  will be performed  at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of 
urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically 
significant,  it will be verified  by the central  laboratory  as soon as  possible  after the investigator 
becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the 
central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the 
assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.  
11.4.3  Elevation  of Liver  Function  Test Parameters  
Mandatory  Liver  Function Testing  
Liver function testing (ALT, AST, gamma -glutamyl transferase [GGT], alkaline phosphatase 
[ALP],  and total bilirubin)  must  be performed  while  subjects  are receiving  LUM/IVA  treatment 
(see Table 3 -2 and Section 11.4.2 ). These blood samples should be processed and shipped 
immediately as per the Laboratory Manual.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  36 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 Rollover subjects who had a study drug interruption at the Week 24 Visit of Study 122B or 
subjects who resumed study drug in Study 122B after a study drug interruption due to elevated 
transaminases but who did not complete the required 4 weeks of rechallenge with LUM/IVA 
(due to <4 weeks  remaining  in the Study  122B  Treatment  Period)  will be reviewed by  the Vertex 
medical monitor and should continue to be monitored based on the guidance for study drug 
interruption and resumption provided below. For example, 4 weeks of rechallenge with 
LUM/IVA should be completed, and any other assessments deemed necessary by the 
investigator  in conjunction  with the Vertex  medical  monitor  may be performed.  If a subject  has a 
study  drug interruption that spans the time period between Week 24 of Study  122B  and Day  1 of 
Study  124, approval from the Vertex medical monitor or designee is required before resumption 
of LUM/IVA in Study 124.  
Subjects  with new ALT  or AST  elevations  of ≥3 × ULN  and clinical  symptoms  will be followed 
closely, including repeat confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 to 
72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT and AST levels, as 
clinically indicated. If a subject cannot return to the site for liver function testing, a local 
laboratory may be used. Elevations in LFTs (ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN) at the local laboratory 
must be  reported  immediately  to the Vertex medical  monitor  or designee,  AND  the subject  must 
have  the tests repeated  and sent to the central  laboratory  as soon  as possible  (ideally  within  48 to 
72 hours).  
Study  Drug  Interruption  
LUM/IVA  administration  must  be interrupted  immediately,  and the Vertex  medical  monitor  or 
designee must be notified if any of the following criteria is met:  
• ALT  or AST  ≥8 × ULN  
• ALT  or AST  ≥5 × ULN for more  than 2 weeks  
• ALT  or AST  ≥3 × ULN  in association with  total bilirubin  ≥2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice  
A thorough  investigation  of potential  causes  should  be conducted,  and the subject  should  be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
Resumption  of Study  Drug  
If a convincing  alternative  etiology  is identified  for the elevated  liver tests (ALT,  AST,  and total 
bilirubin), LUM/IVA may be resumed when levels return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, 
whichever is higher. Approval of the Vertex medical monitor or designee is required before 
resumption of LUM/IVA. Upon resumption of LUM/IVA, transaminases should be assessed 
weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol -defined liver test elevation occurs within 4 weeks of 
rechallenge with LUM/IVA, then LUM/IVA must be discontinued, regardless of the presumed 
etiology.  
Discontinuation of  Study  Drug  
If no convincing alternative etiology  (e.g., acetaminophen use or viral hepatitis) for the elevated 
transaminases  is identified,  regardless  of whether  ALT  or AST  levels  have  improved, LUM/IVA 
treatment must be discontinued, after consulting with the Vertex medical monitor or authorized 
designee. Subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases should have 
their transaminases monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline.

 11.4.4  Physical  Examinations  and Vital  Signs  
A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select 
study  visits.  At other  visits,  symptom -directed  PEs and symptom -directed  vital signs  assessments 
can be performed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider.  
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and 
neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically 
indicated.  After  screening,  any clinically  significant  abnormal  findings  in PEs will be reported  as 
AEs.  
An abbreviated  PE will be performed  at select  study  visits.  The abbreviated  PE will include  an 
assessment of the following body systems: head/neck/thyroid, EENT, cardiovascular system, 
respiratory system, skin, and abdomen.  
Vital  signs  include  blood  pressure  (systolic  and diastolic),  temperature  (any clinically  acceptable 
method may be used, however, the same method should be used at each visit), pulse rate, 
respiration rate, and pulse oximetry. The subject should rest for at least 5 minutes, if possible, 
before vital signs are measured.  
Weight and length/height will be assessed and BMI will be derived. Length/height and weight 
must be measured with the subject in a dry diaper or dry underclothes only. Recumbent length 
should be measured for subjects ≤2 years, or until the subject is comfortable with having  
standing height measured. Recumbent length should be measured while the subject is supine by 
measuring from the crown of the head to the bottom of the feet, with the hips and legs 
straightened.  Standing  height  should  be measured  for subjects  >2 years  of age or once  the subject 
is comfortable with the procedure.  
11.4.5  Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout. Additional standard 
12-lead ECGs  will be performed  at any other  time if clinically  indicated.  The performance  of all 
ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
• The ECG  will be done  before  any other  procedures  that may affect  heart  rate, such as blood 
draws.  
• The subject  will be instructed  to rest for at  least 5 minutes  before  having  an ECG.  
• The test should be  performed in the supine  position  
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained 
with source  documentation.  Clinically  significant  ECG  abnormalities  occurring  during  the study 
through the Safety Follow -up Visit will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure  safety  of the subjects,  the investigator  will make  comparisons  of the ECG  findings  to 
baseline measurements. Repeat ECGs will be performed as deemed appropriate. Subject 
eligibility to continue in the study will be evaluated.  
11.4.6  Ophthalmological  Examination  
OEs must  be conducted  by a licensed  ophthalmologist,  preferably  a pediatric  ophthalmologist. 
The OE includes an examination of the lens with a slit lamp.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  38 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 For the LUM/IVA -naïve subjects, the screening OE must be completed and the results reviewed 
before  enrollment.  If cataract/lens  opacity  is identified  and determined  to be clinically  significant 
by the licensed ophthalmologist at the screening OE, the subject must not be enrolled. The 
screening OE does not need to be repeated if there is documentation of an examination meeting 
protocol criteria that was conducted within 12 weeks before the Screening Visit.  
A Follow -up OE will be performed  approximately  24 weeks  after the last dose of LUM/IVA.

12.3.1  General  Considerations  
All individual subject  data will be presented  in data  listings  based on  the 124  All Subjects  Set. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using  the following  descriptive summary  statistics: 
number  of subjects,  mean,  SD, SE, median,  minimum  value  (min),  and maximum  value  (max).  
Categorical  variables  will be summarized  using  counts  and percentages.  
Baseline  value  will be defined  as the most  recent  non-missing  measurement  (scheduled  or 
unscheduled) collected on or before the first dose of LUM/IVA in Study 124.  
For sweat chloride, values at each visit will be based on averaged measurements from left and 
right arms as specified in Section 11.2.1 . For Rollover Subjects, baseline will be defined as the 
most  recent  non-missing  measurement  (scheduled  or unscheduled)  collected  on or before  the first 
dose of LUM/IVA in Study 124. For LUM/IVA -naïve Subjects, baseline will be defined as the 
average of the values at screening and the pretreatment measurement on Day 1 of Study 124. If 
only 1 pre -first dose measurement of sweat chloride is available, that measurement will be 
considered the baseline.

 13 PROCEDURAL,  ETHICAL,  REGULATORY,  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse  Event  and Serious  Adverse  Event  Documentation,  Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse  Events  
13.1.1.1  Definition  of an Adverse  Event  
An AE is defined  as any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a subject  during  the study;  the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered  serious  if it meets  the definition  in Section  13.1.2.1 . 
13.1.1.2  Clinically  Significant  Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When  possible,  a clinical  diagnosis  for the study  assessment  will be provided,  rather  than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis,  
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
An abnormal  study  assessment  is considered  clinically  significant  if the subject  has 1 or more  of 
the following:  
• Concomitant  signs  or symptoms  related  to the abnormal  study  assessment  
• Further  diagnostic  testing  or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change  in the  dose of study  drug or discontinuation  from the  study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria,  does not necessarily  meet  clinically  significant  criteria.  The determination  of whether  the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory  value  that is Grade  4 will  not automatically  be an SAE.  A Grade  4 laboratory  value 
will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
13.1.1.3  Documentation  of Adverse  Events  
All AEs will be collected from  the time the ICF  is signed  until the following  times:  
• For subjects  who do not enroll:  until time of screen  failure  (e.g.,  screen  failure,  withdrawal  of 
consent)  
• For enrolled  subjects  who have  a Safety  Follow -up Visit:  through  the Safety  Follow -up Visit, 
with the exception of ocular AEs noted during the Follow -up OE.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  45 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 • For enrolled subjects  who do  not have  a Safety  Follow -up Visit,  the earliest  of 
o 14 days after the last dose of study  drug, or 
o the ETT Visit,  if that visit is >10 days following  the last dose of study  drug (see 
Section 9.1.4 ) 
All subject’s parents or legal guardians will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the 
occurrence  of AEs at each study  visit.  When  possible,  a constellation  of signs  and/or  symptoms 
will be identified  as 1 overall  event  or diagnosis.  All AEs for enrolled  subjects  will be recorded 
in the CRF and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently 
enrolled will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be 
documented for each AE:  
• Description  of the event  
• Classification  of “serious”  or “nonserious”  
• Date  of first occurrence  and date of  resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal  relationship  to study  drug(s)  
• Action  taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant  medication  or other  treatment given  
For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting 
period (the Safety Follow -up Visit), it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of 
regulatory  safety  monitoring,  the investigator  is required  to follow  the AE to symptom  resolution 
or until the condition stabilizes.  
13.1.1.4  Adverse  Event  Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Toxicity Grading Scale for 
Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials, 
September 2007, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, 
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInfor  
mation/Guidances/Vaccines/UCM091977.pdf  (Accessed July 2018). When considering the 
severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for 
pediatric clinical laboratory  parameters may  differ from those in the vaccine scale. The severity 
of an AE described by a term that does not appear in this scale will be determined according to 
the definitions in Table 13 -1. 
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  46 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 Table  13-1 Grading  of AE  Severity  
Classification  Definition  
 
Mild (Grade 1)  Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities 
Moderate (Grade 2)  Moderate  level  of discomfort  and significantly  interferes  with regular  activities 
Severe (Grade 3)  Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening 
(Grade 4)  Any adverse  drug event  that places  the subject,  in the view  of the investigator,  at 
immediate risk of death  
 
 
 
13.1.1.5  Adverse  Event  Causality  
Every  effort  will be made  by the investigator  to assess  the relationship  of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table 13 -2. 
Table  13-2 Classifications  for AE Causality  
Classification  Definition  
 
Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational 
study  drug and causes  other  than the investigational  study  drug have  been  ruled  out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational  study  drug and there  is a plausible  mechanism  for the event  to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event  is unlikely  to be related  to the investigational  study  drug and likely  to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event  is related  to an etiology  other  than the investigational  study  drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
 
 
13.1.1.6  Study  Drug  Action  Taken  
The investigator  will classify  the study  drug action taken  with regard  to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table 13 -3. 
Table  13-3 Classifications  for Study  Drug  Action  Taken  With  Regard  to an AE 
Classification  Definition  
 
Dose  not changed  Study  drug dose not changed  in response  to an AE 
Dose  reduced  Study  drug dose reduced  in response  to an AE 
Drug  interrupted  Study  drug administration  interrupted  in response  to an AE 
Drug  withdrawn  Study  drug administration  permanently  discontinued  in response  to an AE 
Not applicable  Action  taken  regarding  study  drug administration  does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in  circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment  had been  completed  before  the AE began  and no opportunity  to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  47 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 13.1.1.7  Adverse  Event  Outcome  
An AE will be followed  until the investigator  has determined  and provided  the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table 13 -4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications  for Outcome  of an  AE 
Classification  Definition  
 
Recovered/resolved  Resolution  of an AE with no residual  signs  or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved  with 
sequelae  
Not recovered/not 
resolved  (continuing)  Resolution  of an AE with residual  signs  or symptoms  
 
Either  incomplete  improvement  or no improvement  of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome  of an AE is death. “Fatal” will  be used when  death  is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome  of an AE is not known  (e.g., a  subject  lost to followup)  
 
 
13.1.1.8  Treatment  Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response  to an AE, and may include  treatments  such as other  medications,  surgery,  or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious  Adverse  Events  
13.1.2.1  Definition  of a Serious Adverse  Event  
An SAE is  any AE that  meets  any of the  following  outcomes:  
• Fatal  (death,  regardless  of cause,  that occurs  during  participation  in the study  or occurs  after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity  due to administration of the study 
drug)  
• Life-threatening,  such that the subject  was at immediate  risk of death  from  the reaction  as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of hospitalization  
• Persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  (disability  is defined  as a substantial  disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly  or birth  defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may  jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above  (e.g.,  an allergic  bronchospasm  requiring  intensive  treatment  in an emergency  room  or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred  before  the subject  signed  the ICF,  and the hospitalization  or procedure  was planned 
before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  48 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 indicate  an SAE,  unless  an AE caused  the hospitalization  or procedure  to be rescheduled  sooner 
or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not 
associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event,  as in mild,  moderate,  or severe  myocardial  infarction.  The event  itself,  however,  may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
13.1.2.2  Reporting  and Documentation  of Serious  Adverse  Events  
All SAEs  that occur  after obtaining  informed  consent  and assent  (where  applicable)  through  the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex 
Global  Patient  Safety  (GPS)  within  24 hours  of identification . In addition,  all SAEs  that occur 
after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to 
Vertex GPS within 24 hours of identification . 
For SAEs  that occur  after obtaining  informed  consent  and assent  (where  applicable)  through  the 
Safety Follow -up Visit, the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to 
report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report 
follow -up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health 
authorities.  
Please  send completed  SAE  Forms  to Vertex  GPS via: 
Email:  globalpatientsafety@vrtx.com  (preferred  choice) 
Fax: +1 -617-341-6159  
For technical  issues  related  to submitting  the form,  contact  telephone:  +1-617-341-6677  
SAEs  that occur  after the Safety  Follow -up Visit  and are considered  related  to study  drug(s) will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred 
to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the 
event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study 
drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the  SAE  Form, relationship to study  drug(s) will be assessed 
only as related (includes possibly  related) or not related (includes unlikely  related), and severity 
assessment will not be  required. For the  purposes of study  analysis, if the  event has  not resolved 
at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of 
regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and 
report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.  
13.1.2.3  Expedited  Reporting  and Investigator  Safety  Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IECs, and 
participating investigators in accordance with ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory 
requirements,  as applicable.  In addition,  Vertex,  or authorized  designee,  will be responsible  for 
the submission of safety letters to central IECs.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  49 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 It is the responsibility  of the investigator  or designee  to promptly  notify  the local IRB/IEC  of all 
unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects.  
13.2 Administrative  Requirements  
13.2.1  Ethical  Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current ICH GCP Guidelines, which are 
consistent with the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki, and in accordance 
with local applicable laws and regulations. The IRB/IEC will review all appropriate study 
documentation to safeguard the rights, safety, and well -being of the subjects. The study will be 
conducted  only at sites where  IRB/IEC  approval  has been  obtained.  The protocol,  Investigator’s 
Brochure, sample ICF, advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the subjects 
(including diary cards), safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to these 
documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC by  the investigator or Vertex, as allowable by  local 
applicable laws and regulations.  
13.2.2  Subject  Information  and Informed  Consent  
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject’s parent or legal guardian before study participation. The method of obtaining and 
documenting  the informed consent and assent (if applicable)  and the contents  of the consent will 
comply  with ICH GCP  and all applicable  laws and regulations  and will be subject  to approval  by 
Vertex or its designee.  
13.2.3  Investigator  Compliance  
No modifications to the protocol will be made without the approval of both the investigator and 
Vertex.  Changes  that significantly  affect  the safety  of the subjects,  the scope  of the investigation, 
or the scientific  quality  of the study  (i.e., efficacy  assessments)  will require IRB/IEC  notification 
before implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol modifications to the 
required regulatory authorities.  
When  circumstances require  an immediate  departure  from  procedures  set forth  in the protocol, 
the investigator  will contact  Vertex  to discuss  the planned  course  of action.  If possible,  contact 
will be made  before  the implementation  of any changes.  Any departures  from  the protocol  will 
be fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol deviation log.  
13.2.4  Access  to Records  
The investigator will make the office and/or hospital records of subjects enrolled in this study 
available for inspection by Vertex or its representative at the time of each monitoring visit and 
for audits. The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and copying, as 
required by applicable laws and regulations, by officials of the regulatory health authorities  
(FDA  and others).  The investigator  will comply  with applicable  privacy  and security  laws for use 
and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this protocol.  
13.2.5  Subject  Privacy  
To maintain  subject  confidentiality  and to comply  with applicable  data protection  and privacy 
laws and regulations, all CRFs, study reports, and communications relating to the study will 
identify subjects by assigned subject numbers, and access to subject names linked to such  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  50 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 numbers will be limited to the site and the study  physician and will not be disclosed to Vertex. 
As required by applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which the study is being 
conducted, the investigator will allow Vertex and/or its representatives access to all pertinent 
medical records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the CRFs/SAE Forms and the 
review  of the data collection  process.  The FDA  and regulatory  authorities  in other  jurisdictions, 
including the IRB/IEC, may also request access to all study records, including source 
documentation, for inspection.  
For sites participating in the US, and in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability  Act (HIPAA) and associated regulations, an executed HIPAA authorization will 
be obtained by the site from each subject (or the legal representative of the subject) before 
research activities may begin. Each HIPAA authorization will comply with all HIPAA 
requirements including authorization allowing the site access to and use of the subject’s 
personally  identifiable  health  information,  authorization  for the site to disclose  such information 
to Vertex, the FDA, and other parties requiring access under the protocol, and statements as to 
the purpose for which such information may be used and for how long.  
13.2.6  Record  Retention  
The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH GCP Guidelines and/or 
applicable local regulatory requirement(s), whichever is longest, as described in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study 
records,  custody  will be transferred  to a person  willing  to accept  the responsibility  and Vertex 
will be notified.  
13.2.7  Study  Termination  
At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or may terminate this study at any 
particular  site. In addition,  for reasonable  cause,  either  the investigators  or their IRBs/IECs  may 
terminate the study at their center.  
Conditions  that may lead to reasonable  cause  and warrant  termination  include,  but are not limited 
to: 
• Subject  or investigator  noncompliance  
• Unsatisfactory  subject enrollment  
• Lack  of adherence  to protocol procedures  
• Lack  of evaluable  and/or complete  data 
• Potentially  unacceptable  risk to study  subjects  
• Decision  to modify  drug development plan 
• Decision by  the FDA  or other  regulatory  authority  
Written  notification  that includes  the reason  for the clinical study  termination  is required.  
13.2.8  End of  Study  
The end of  study  is defined as  the last scheduled visit (or  scheduled contact) of  the last subject.  
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  51 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 13.3 Data  Quality  Assurance  
Vertex  or its designated  representative  will conduct  a study  site visit to verify  the qualifications 
of each investigator, inspect clinical study site facilities, and inform the investigator of 
responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation.  
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other  data pertinent to the study  for each subject. Study 
data for each enrolled  subject  will be entered  into a CRF  by study  site personnel using  a secure, 
validated, web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. Vertex will have read -only 
access to site -entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances  of missing,  discrepant,  or uninterpretable  data will be queried  with the investigator  for 
resolution.  Any changes  to study  data will be made  to the CRF  and documented  in an audit  trail, 
which will be maintained within the clinical database.  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to 
comply with GCP Guidelines. On -site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for completeness and 
clarity,  cross -checking  with source  documents,  and clarification  of administrative  matters  will be 
performed.  
The study  will be monitored  by Vertex or  its designee.  Monitoring  will be done  by personal 
visits from a representative of Vertex or designee (study  site monitor), who will review the 
CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the 
investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements.  
13.4 Electronic  Data  Capture  
Vertex  will provide  the study  sites with secure  access  to and training  on the EDC  application 
sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct information in the CRFs on the 
subjects for which they are responsible.  
A CRF  will be completed  for each enrolled  study  subject. It  is the investigator’s  responsibility  to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s 
CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject’s participation in 
the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, 
and subject status.  
The investigator,  or designated  representative,  will complete  the CRF  as soon  as possible  after 
information is collected.  
The audit  trail entry  will show  the user’s  identification  information  and the date and time of any 
correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, 
including any changes made to them, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for 
whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex  will retain  the CRF  data and  corresponding  audit  trails.  A copy  of the final archival  CRF 
in the form  of a compact disc  (CD)  or other  electronic  media  will be placed  in the investigator’s 
study file.  
13.5 Confidentiality  and Disclosure  
Any and all scientific, commercial, and technical information disclosed by Vertex in this 
protocol  or elsewhere  will be  considered  the confidential  and proprietary  property  of Vertex. The 
Protocol  VX19 -809-124, Version  2.0 Page  52 of 57 
Vertex  Pharmaceuticals  Incorporated  Confidential  Information   
 investigator shall hold such information in confidence and shall not disclose the information to 
any third  party  except  to such  of the investigator's employees  and staff as have  been  made  aware 
that the information  is confidential  and who are bound  to treat it as such and to  whom  disclosure 
is necessary  to evaluate  that information.  The investigator  shall  not use such information  for any 
purpose  other  than determining  mutual interest in performing  the study  and, if the parties  decide 
to proceed with the study, for the purpose of conducting the study.  
The investigator  understands  that the information  developed  from  this clinical  study  will be used 
by Vertex  in connection  with the development  of the study  drug and other  drugs  and diagnostics, 
and therefore may be disclosed as required to other clinical investigators, business partners and 
associates, the FDA, and other government agencies. The investigator also understands that, to 
allow for the use of the information derived from the clinical study, the investigator has the 
obligation to provide Vertex with complete test results and all data developed in the study.  
13.6 Publications  and Clinical  Study  Report  
13.6.1  Publication  of Study  Results  
Vertex is committed to reporting the design and results of all clinical studies in a complete, 
accurate,  balanced,  transparent,  and timely  manner,  consistent  with Good  Publication  Practices 
(GPP3).19 
Publication  Planning : Vertex  staff along  with the lead principal  investigators  (PIs),  the steering 
committee (SC), and/or the publication committee (PC) will work together to develop a 
publication plan.  
Authorship : Authorship  of publications  will be determined  based  on the Recommendations  for 
Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which 
states that authorship should be based on the following 4 criteria:20 
1. Substantial  contributions  to conception  and design,  acquisition  of data,  or analysis  and 
interpretation of data;  
2. Drafting  of the  article  or revising  it critically  for important intellectual content;  
3. Final  approval of the  version to be  published; and 
4. Agreement  to be accountable  for all aspects  of the work  in ensuring  that questions  related 
to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and 
resolved.  
All authors  must  meet  conditions  1, 2, 3, and 4. All persons  designated  as authors  should  qualify 
for authorship,  and all those  who qualify  should  be listed.  Contributions  such as medical  writing, 
enrollment of subjects, acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the 
research group, alone, do not justify authorship.  
Contributors : Contributors who meet fewer than all 4 of International Committee of Medical 
Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship will not be listed as authors, but their 
contribution  will be acknowledged  and specified  either  as a group  (e.g.,  “study  investigators”)  or 
individually (e.g., “served as scientific advisor”).  
Publication  Review : As required  by a separate  clinical  study  agreement,  Vertex  must  have  the 
opportunity to review all publications, including any manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide

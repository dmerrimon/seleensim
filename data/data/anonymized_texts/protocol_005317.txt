Study Synopsis 
 
 
Study Design: The risk of lung cancer varies by individual and by ethnic/racial group. In this 
study we will explore how individual differences in the metabolism of a tobacco-
specific lung carcinogen may contribute to the variable risk of lung cancer 
between ethnic/racial groups. 
 
In this 10 day clinical trial, Japanese Americans will smoke a cigarette 
containing deuterium-labeled 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone 
(NNK), a tobacco-specific lung carcinogen. The study cigarette will be smoked 
for 7 days.  
This will allow for NNK metabolic profiling and determining the effect o f CYP2A6 
genotype on the level of NNK α–hydroxylation in Japanese Americans smokers 
using [pyridine- D4]-NNK containing cigarettes.    
Primary Aim: • To characterize the bioactivation of NNK by α-hydroxylation; 
• To develop an NNK metabolite profiling method; 
• To determine the contribution of the enzyme CYP2A6 to NNK 
bioactivation.

1.1 Purpose:  
Smoking is the cause of 90% of all lung cancer but only 11-24% of smokers d evelop the 
disease .1 The risk of lung cancer varies by individual and by ethnic/racial group.2, 3 In 
this study we will explore how individual differences in the me tabolism of a tobacco-
specific lung carcinogen may contribute to the variable risk of lung cancer betwe en 
ethnic/racial groups. In this protocol we will specifically test the hypothesis that 
carcinogen bioactivation varies by a smoker’s CYP2A6 activity. CYP2A6 activity varies by 
ethnic group and the activity of this enzyme is associated with lung canc er.  Therefore, 
determining the role of the enzyme in the bioactivation of tobacco carcinogen s will 
contribute to our understanding of the mechanism by which CY2A6 activit y influences 
racial/ethnic differences in lung cancer. 
2.0 Background 
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  
The risk of lung cancer for individual smokers and members of differen t ethnic/racial 
groups varies significantly. Differences in carcinogen exposure, activation and 
detoxification contribute to this variable risk. In this study, we will characterize the 
metabolic pathways of the tobacco-specific lung carcinogen, NNK, in Japa nese American 
(JA) smokers.  JA have a high prevalence CYP2A6  variants that code for low activity and 
non-functional enzyme. 4, 5 CYP2A6 is the primary enzyme that metabolizes nicotine and 
a key enzyme involved in the bio-activation of NNK. 6-8   
There are over 20 identified lung carcinogens in tobacco smoke.1, 9 These include 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, NNK, volatiles such as butadiene, metals such as  
cadmium, and radioactive 210Po.1  Among these the evidence for a role in human lung 
cancer is strongest for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  and NNK, which reproducibly 
and at modest doses induce lung tumors in laboratory animals.1, 10, 11  NNK, which is the 
focus of this project, is unique in that it is tobacco-specific. N NK is considered 
"carcinogenic to humans" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and its 
urinary metabolite NNAL, a biomarker of NNK exposure, has been prospectively 
associated with lung cancer.11-13 
The overall hypothesis of the program project grant under which this protocol wil l be 
carried out is that the differential lung cancer risk across ethnic/racial groups is due to 
differences in exposure and response to tobacco smoke carcinogens. In the p rior grant 
period significant differences in carcinogen exposure across ethnic/racial group s were 
documented. 14, 15 Exposures were highest in African Americans (AA) and lowest in 
Japanese Americans (JA) compared to Whites. These data are consistent with the 
relative lung cancer risk in these 3 groups. The lower carcinogen exposure in JA was 
driven by the influence of CYP2A6 activity on nicotine metabolism.5 The focus of this 
study is to determine the influence of CYP2A6 variants on NNK metaboli sm

 Page 7 of 25  2.2 Preliminary Data:  
In this project we will characterize the metabolic pathways of th e tobacco-specific lung 
carcinogen, NNK, in JA smoking D 4-pyridyl NNK-containing cigarettes.  The rationale for focusing 
our study on NNK metabolism in JA is: 1) NNK is a tobacco-specific l ung carcinogen 2) CYP2A6 is 
a catalyst of NNK bioactivation (by α -hydroxylation) 3) CYP2A6 activity and genotype is 
associated with lung cancer, and 4) CYP2A6 copy number variants and other  loss of function 
alleles are present at relatively high frequency in JA compared to other ethn ic groups.5 
D4-pyridyl NNK-containing cigarettes.  Preliminary data from a prior study that was identical in 
design to the one proposed here, demonstrated a significant level of i nterindividual variation in 
NNK α-hydroxylation across smokers. The prior study that used Marlboro Virgi nia Blend 
cigarettes (as well as a previously published study with Quest cigaret tes16), added [pyridine-
D4]NNK to the study cigarettes so that the sum of NNK and  [pyridine-D4]NNK was not higher 
than the level of NNK in conventional cigarettes. In this study American  spirit cigarettes will be 
used.  The beauty of using [pyridine-D4]NNK is that the products of NNK α -hydroxylation (such 
as hydroxy acid the primary urinary metabolite, Fig. 2) may be distinguished from common 
metabolites formed from nicotine. This is critical as nicotine is  present in cigarettes at levels 
that far exceed those of NNK.  
In the prior study of African Americans and Whites, the ratio of D4-hydroxy acid to total D4-
NNAL was used as a measure of the total NNK and NNAL α -hydroxylation (fig 2). This ratio varied 
about 6 fold among the 114 subjects analyzed, suggesting t hat significant inter-individual 
variation occurs. However, since hydroxy acid is a metabolite of  both NNAL and NNK this ratio is 
not ideal to establish a relationship of CYP2A6 activity wi th NNK bioactiva tion. In this project, α -
hydroxymethyl NNK Gluc will be used a direct measure of the flux of NNK metabolism through 
the α -hydroxylation pathway. In addition, by carrying out the s tudy in JA smokers with no 
CYP2A6 activity we will be able to determine the importance of CYPA6 to NNK bioactivation. 
Preliminary e vidence of an association of P450 2A6 genotype with NNK α -hydroxylation . To test 
the hypothesis that CYP2A6 activity will influence the extent of NNK met abolism by α -
hydroxylation we compared total NNAL levels, corrected for smoking dose (TNE), in  smokers 
homozygous for CYP2A6 loss of function alleles to homozygous "normal" smokers.   The 
geometric mean ratio of total NNAL/TNE excreted by L/L individuals (n=54) was lower, 0.0358 
(95% CI, 0.0.33-0.038) than the ratio for N/N individuals, 0.0427 (0.036-0.051). This difference 
was borderline significant (p=0.09). Our interpretation of these data is that smo kers with no 
CYP2A6 activity metabolize NNK less by α -hydroxylation and more by reduction to NNAL.   
Given the limitation of these data, (not directly measuring α -hydroxylation, further metabolism 
of NNAL, and the use of TNE as a proxy for NNK dose) it was encouraging that the e ffect was in 
the direction predicted. In this protocol, we will minimize these limitat ions by quantifying a 
more direct me asure of NNK α -hydroxylation, the α -hydroxymethyl NNK Gluc as well as 
quantifying the total NNK metabolite profile, and therefore the total d ose of NNK more 
accurately by using [pyridine-D4] NNK.

 Page 8 of 25  2.3 Existing Literature:  
Our previous studies support an association of CYP2A6 activity with lung cancer. This 
association is, at least in part, driven by the influence of CYP2A6 activity o n nicotine 
metabolism and smoking intensity (ref). CYP2A6 also catalyzes the metabolism NNK . 7, 8 
Therefore, individuals deficient in CYP2A6 activity may not only smoke  less but may also be 
protected from NNK carcinogenesis 
Lung cancer and CYP2A6 
Meta-analyses of the association between CYP2A6 genetic polymorphisms and risk of lung 
cancer reported a statistically significant approximately 50% lower crude od ds ratio of lung 
cancer for poor metabolizers (e.g., carriers of two loss of-function allele or one  loss-of-function 
allele and one decreased-function allele) in Asians smokers.17, 18  In a recent analysis on the 
small number of lung cancer cases that have occurred in the multi ethn ic cohort (MEC) for 
whom we have analyzed nicotine metabolism, CYP2A6 activity was associated wit h an 
increased risk of lung cancer.19  Also, in, a genome wide association study by the 
Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL) consortium a SNP in CYP2A6, w hich 
was associated with lower CYP2A6 activity, was significantly associated with the decrea sed risk 
of lung cancer.20  Importantly, the populations included in the TRICL consortium are 
predominantly White. Together these studies support an association of CYP2 A6 activity with 
lung cancer. This association is, at least in part, driven by the influen ce of CYP2A6 activity on 
nicotine metabolism and smoking intensity. In this project we wil l begin to test the hypothesis 
that the relationship of CYP2A6 to lung cancer may also be mediated by its key role in the 
bioactivation of the tobacco specific lung carcinogen NNK. 
Nicotine metabolism 
In most smokers the predominant pathway of nicotine metabolism is CY P2A6-catalyzed C-
oxidation15 (Fig. 1). The product of this reaction is oxidized to cotinine, wh ich is then 
metabolized to trans  3’-hydroxycotinine (3-HCOT). Nicotine, cotinine and 3-HCOT are all 
glucuronidated (Fig. 2). The sum of these metabolites plus nicotine and nic otine N-oxide (Fig. 2) 
is referred to as total nicotine equivalents (TNE) and account for >85%  of the nicotine dose. TNE 
are an objective measure of smoking.16  CYP2A6 is the primary catalyst of the oxidation of 
cotinine to 3-HCOT, and the ratio of 3-HCOT to cotinine (in plasma or  urine) has been used as a 
measure of CYP2A6 activity.15,17  This ratio will be used in the current project to quantify 
CYP2A6 activity, which will allow us to identify individuals with  little or no activity and those 
with relatively high or normal activity. 
In our prior studies of the MEC, nicotine metabolism was comprehensively c haracterized in five 
ethnic groups.18 Nicotine C-oxidation was significantly lower in JA than in Whites or AA. JA 
excreted the highest concentration of nicotine and the lowest conc entration of TNE, adjusted 
for cigarettes per day (CPD). These data are consistent with the relatively low risk o f lung cancer 
in JA compared to Whites. When TNE are adjusted for CYP2A6 activity (total 3-HCOT/cotinine) 
there is no longer a statistically significant difference between th e TNE excreted by JA and 
Whites.19  We analyzed CYP2A6 genotype in these smokers and demonstrated in JA the di rect 
relationship between CYP2A6 genotype and both the 3-hydroxycotinine to cot inine ratio 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Study 2: Metabolism of NNK Among JA 
VERSION DATE: October 11, 2019 
 Page 9 of 25  (CYP2A6 activity) and TNE. These data 
support the hypothesis that in JA 
smoking intensity (and therefore 
carcinogen dose) is significantly 
influenced by CYP2A6-catalyzed nicotine 
metabolism.  
 
 
NNK metabolism  
There are three pathways of NNK 
metabolism; reduction to NNAL, α -
hydroxylation and N-oxidation21 (Fig. 
2). NNAL, also a lung carcinogen7 is further metabolized by α -hydroxylation, N-oxidation and 
two pathways of glucuronidation.22 NNAL glucuronidation is a detoxification pathway for 
NNK.23 Two NNAL glucuronides are formed: NNAL-O-Gluc or NNAL-N-Gluc (Fig. 3). 
Bioactivation of NNK and NNAL occurs by α -hydroxylation of either the methyl or methylene 
carbon next to the nitroso group. The α -hydroxy products of these pathways decompose to 
highly reactive DNA-binding diazohydroxides. The DNA adducts generated, if  not repaired may 
initiate the carcinogenic process. The products of NNK α -hydroxylation excreted in the urine,- 
hydroxy acid and keto acid - are minor metabolites of nicotine. Therefore, these major urinary 
NNK metabolites cannot be used as measures of NNK bioactivation (the α -hydroxylation 
pathway). NNK metabolites  that still contain the nitroso group cou ld be used as biomarkers of 
NNK metabolism.  The α-OH-NNK Gluc is the only characterized metabolite of NNK α-
hydroxylation, and its level in smokers should be dependent on CYP2A6 act ivity, and could 
serve as a measure of NNK bioactivation. The relationship of α-OH- NNK Gluc to total α -
hydroxylation will be determined in the two groups (normal and low/no CYP 2A6 activity) of JA 
smokers of [pyridine-D 4]-NNK cigarettes in this protocol. 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) catalyze the α -hydroxylation of both NNK and NNAL.21 These 
enzymes include CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2.24,25 In human liver microsomes, up to 70% of 
NNK α -hydroxylation is inhibited by CYP2A6 antibodies.24 CYP2B6 is similar in catalytic efficiency 
to CYP2A6, but is typically less abundant in the liver.24,26  These data support an important 
(albeit not exclusive) role for CYP2A6 in the catalysis of NNK α -hydroxylation. In this project we 
will take advantage of the high prevalence of CYP2A6  copy number variants (CNV) and loss of 
function alleles in JA smokers to quantify the role of this enzyme in the metabolism of NNK. Our 
preliminary data (described above) provides some evidence for an association of CYP2A6  
genotype with NNK α -hydroxylation.  
We have recently developed a targeted metabolomics approach for urine from rats 
administered [pyridine-D 4]-NNK (ref). This method will be applied to the analysis of the JA 
smokers of [pyridine-D 4]-NNK containing cigarettes to determine the relative amounts of all  
NNK metabolites (fig.2).  This will be the first characterization o f an NNK metabolic profile in 
smokers.

 Page 10 of 25  The goals of this study of a small group of JA smoking [pyridine-D 4]-NNK cigarettes is 1) to 
determine the influence of CYP2A6 activity on NNK a-hydroxylation pathw ays and 2) to 
determine if the α-OH-NNK Gluc reflects differences in a-hydroxylation measured in these tw o 
groups.  This will allow us to determine the contribution of CYP2A6 to N NK bioactivation, and 
ideally to identify α-OH-NNK Gluc(s) as potential measures of NNK bioactivation.  We will 
validate the NNK metabolic profiling approach in participants with li ttle or no CYP2A6 activity, 
who we predict will have decreased metabolism through the α-hydroxylation pathway and 
increased metabolism by NNAL and the NNK-N-oxide pathways.

4.1 Description:  
The goal of this trial is to determine the effect of CYP2A6 genotype/pheno type on NNK 
α-hydroxylation in Japanese American (JA) smokers administered [pyridine-D 4]NNK for 7 
days. Japanese American smokers (N=20 completers) will be recruited from the 100+  
Japanese Americans participating in Study 1: Observation Study part of “Mechanisms of Fig. 2  NNK metabolism

 Page 11 of 25  Ethnic/Racial Differences in Lung Cancer Due to Cigarette Smoking” Clinical and 
Biomarkers Core. 
4.2 Drug/Device Handling: 
The study will use a commercial tobacco product that has [pyridine-D 4]NNK added to 
the tobacco thereby making it an investigational tobacco product.  Natural American 
Spirit-Tan cigarettes (king size, hard pack) are commercially manufactured by th e Santa 
Fe Natural Tobacco Company currently marketed by RJ Reynolds and are available for 
purchase in retail stores and online.  The American Spirits-Tan were chosen because 
they have approximately 11% of the level of NNK found in other manufactured 
cigarettes. Natural American Spirit-Tan cigarettes will be modified by inje cting [pyridine-
D4]NNK into the tobacco rod of these cigarettes so that the sum of the naturally present 
NNK and the added [pyridine-D 4]NNK is similar to or below the NNK levels found in 
typical commercial U.S. cigarettes.  
 
Preparation of study cigarettes 
The addition of [pyridine-D 4]NNK to study cigarettes will be carried out by following our 
previously established methods 16  American Spirit-Tan cigarettes will be purchased by 
University of Minnesota (king size, hard pack) which contain 0.21 - 0.37 μg NNK/g wet 
weight tobacco. The cigarettes will be modified by adding 0.300 μg [pyridine-D 4]NNK to 
each cigarette so that the amount of total (deuterated plus unlabeled ) NNK in these 
cigarettes is below 0.700 μg/g tobacco which is the average NNK level in popular 
commercial cigarette brands. [Pyridine- D 4]NNK has been synthesized in our laboratory.  
The addition of [pyridine-D 4]NNK to the cigarettes will be carried out with a specially 
designed microsyringe applicator system. The prepared cigarettes will be conditi oned at 
25°C and 60% relative humidity for 2 days, placed back in their original p acks, 20 
cigarettes per pack, and stored at 4°C until being dispensed to study participants. 
 
The cigarettes will be processed and stored at the Masonic Cancer Center. Onc e the 
cigarettes are spiked with the deuterated NNK they will be transferred  to the University 
of Hawai ’i study site.  The study cigarettes will be kept in a locked refrigerator and o nly 
study staff will have access. Detailed records of study cigarettes received, dispen sed and 
returned will be kept. Any study product remaining after the compl etion of the trial will 
be destroyed per the University of Hawaii’s institutional Chemical Waste procedures. 
 
5.0 Procedures Involved 
5.1 Study Design: 
In this clinical trial, the selection and recruitment will be det ermined based on the 
urinary ratios of CYP2A6-genreated nicotine metabolites total 3-HCOT to c otinine. Little 
or no-activity is defined as a ratio of <0.6 (expected 12% for JA from previous MEC 
sample and "relatively high" is defined as a ratio of >3.0. (28% had a ratio >3 and 15 % 
<0.6 expected for JA smokers in the previous MEC sample and had a median rati o of 
1.8).

per day as reported in the participant ’s baseline Daily Tobacco Use Diary.   
2. Complete the Study Product Dispensing Log 
3. Instruct participant to: 
• Smoke only the study cigarettes and to use no other nicotine-containi ng 
products or combustibles over the 7-day intervention period. 
• Smoke approximately the same number of cigarettes per day as when 
smoking their usual brand of cigarettes and to try to maintain this ra te of 
smoking for the duration of the study.  
• Collect all study cigarette spent filters (butts). Return of all use d cigarette 
butts in dated ziplock collection baggies at next clinic visit. Retu rn all 
unsmoked cigarettes and empty cigarette packs. This allows for verification 
of amount of study cigarettes smoked.  
Additional Procedures for Visit 4 and 5   
1. Blood draw (2 lavender and 1 red top) 
Additional Procedures for Visit 6   
1. Provide tobacco cessation materials to the participant and advise to set a quit date.  
2. Arrange for study compensation.

PROTOCOL TITLE: Study 2: Metabolism of NNK Among JA 
VERSION DATE: October 11, 2019 
 Page 19 of 25  11.2 Withdrawal Procedures: If a participant is no longer eligible, they will be 
informed at the visit and data collection will stop. If withdraw al is due to an adverse 
event, appropriate follow-up will be completed. 
11.3 Termination Procedures: No additional procedures will be completed however, 
data already collected may be used. 
12.0 Risks to Participants 
12.1 Foreseeable Risks:  
Potential risks: The potential risks for participants are minimal.  
 
In this Clinical Study, the risks in this study include:  
1) Loss of privacy due to a breach in confidentiality; 
2) Risk of pain, bruising or infection at the site of the phleb otomy; and  
3) Use of study cigarettes.   
Protection against breach of confidentiality:  
Participants will be told their participation in the project will be strictly confidential, that 
any identifying information will only be available to the site inves tigators, coordinating 
center study manager, an auditor for the Food and Drug Administration, study sponsor 
or University of Hawai i’s institutional oversight. No identifying information concerning 
the data and results will be made known. Participants will have writ ten assurance that 
while de-identified individual participant data may be available  to other researchers for 
research purposes, only a summary of the results will ever be published or other wise 
publicly released. They will also be informed that all raw data will be c oded with 
numbers and any identifiers will be kept in locked file cabinets an d only appropriate 
study personnel will have access.  
 
All data will be de-identified and transferred through a secure, p assword-protected 
website that is only available to the investigators. All identifying i nformation will be in a 
locked in a secure place and accessible only to relevant study staff. 
 
Risk with phlebotomy: 
Blood samples will be obtained by a trained phlebotomist with single-use,  sterile blood 
collection supplies to minimize the risk associated with a blood draw. 
 
Smoking Study Cigarettes:  
Clinical Study participants will be smoking cigarettes containing deuteri um labeled NNK, 
which has not led to any adverse events in the studies that we have completed  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). To minimize risk, participants will have a review of their 
medical history prior to entry into this study to screen for any potentially compromising 
medical condition. Participants will be under medical supervision t hroughout their 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Study 2: Metabolism of NNK Among JA 
VERSION DATE: October 11, 2019 
 Page 20 of 25  participation in the clinical study and adverse symptoms will be recorded at each clinic 
visit and monitored by the study’s health professional.  
 
The study cigarettes pose the same risks of conventional cigarettes. Because smoking 
causes a multitude of diseases, if at any time the smoker wants to quit use of all tobacco 
products, this decision will be encouraged and supported. At the end of study, 
participants will be strongly encouraged to stop use of all tobacco product s and to set a 
quit date, and will be provided with a treatment resources and ref erral to local 
treatment options.    
 
Participants will be informed the study cigarettes contain the same risks as smoking any 
combustible tobacco product. Precautions would be similar to other tobac co products 
including smoking related health risks, secondhand smoke exposure and f ire danger.  
Participants will be advised to keep out of reach of children or pets. 
 
Throughout their participation in the study, adverse symptoms will be recorded at each 
clinic visit and monitored by the PIs and study medical personnel. P articipants who 
experience any significant adverse side effects will be examined by a physic ian, sent or 
accompanied to the emergency clinic or referred to their physician, dependin g on the 
nature and severity of the side effect or adverse event. 
12.2 Reproduction Risks:  No additional risk to the fetus than the risk associa ted with 
conventional cigarettes.  We will conduct a pregnancy screen of child-bearing 
women prior to providing study cigarettes to verify status.   
12.3 Risks to Others: No additional risk of study cigarettes; all cigarettes pose a risk  of 
exposure to second-hand smoke. 
13.0 Potential Benefits to Participants 
13.1 Potential Benefits: None 
14.0 Statistical Considerations 
14.1 Data Analysis Plan:  
In subjects with little CYP2A6 activity we expect the metabolism through 
NNAL to be significantly higher and metabolism by α-hydroxylation to be 
much lower than in smokers with "normal" CYP2A6 activity. The extent of 
NNK α-hydroxylation in the two groups will be described by a ratio of NNK 
metabolites, D 4- α-hydroxymethyl NNK Gluc ( or other products of α -
hydroxylation) to D 4-NNAL.  The ratio is used as a measure of the pathway 
as a percent of dose. The values are predicted to be lower in the smok ers 
with little or no CYP2A6-activity.  
Statistical considerations: Our comparison will be between the means (or i f 
the distribution is highly skewed the medians or geometric means) of the 
two groups (null versus average CYP2A6). The power of the test depends

VERSION DATE: October 11, 2019 
 Page 22 of 25  A Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be convened and will be com prised of 
three experts in the areas of tobacco toxicants, clinical studies. The 
Board/Committee will include individuals with an MD, a PhD, and a  statistician. 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board will begin by reviewing the protocol  and 
establishing guidelines for data and safety monitoring. This will inc lude 
developing standard procedures for day-to-day monitoring by the int ernal 
monitors, investigators and study staff. This Board will meet at regular intervals 
(at least once a year) to evaluate the progress of the study, review data quality, 
patient recruitment, study retention, and examine other factors that may affect  
study outcome. They will also review the participant’s ability to ach ieve the 
study requirements and the rates of adverse events to determine whether t here 
has been any change in participant risk. Their review will ensure that p articipant 
risk does not outweigh the study benefits. A brief report will be gener ated from 
each of these meetings for the study record and forwarded to each of t he study 
site’s Institutional Review Boards (IRB). The DSMB will be available to  convene 
outside of their regular meetings, if necessary, if concerns should arise regarding 
a particular participant, or any troublesome trends are observed in the 
participant experiences. They will make appropriate recommendations for 
changes in protocol, if needed. The UHCC also has a Cancer Protocol Review 
Committee that meets to review all cancer related protocols and thi s study will 
also be subjected to review by this committee on a yearly basis.  
All study cigarette-related adverse events of a non-serious nature will be 
reported to each institution’s IRB at the time of IRB renewal application 
submission. Reportable adverse events will be reported by telephone to the IRB 
within 3 days of our receipt of information regarding the event and written 
reports will be submitted within 10 days. The Data and Safety Monitor ing Board 
will review all serious or unexpected adverse events and provide 
recommendations. 
NIH will be informed of any significant action taken as a result of the Data and 
Monitoring Board’s findings. We will inform the participants of any changes in 
risk. 
At the time of IRB annual review, a copy of the submission will be provided to the UHCC 
and UMN Cancer Center Protocol Review Committee. 
16.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants 
16.1 Protecting Privacy:  
For this study, most physiological and subjective measures will be no ninvasive and 
should present no psychological or medical risk to the participant. Some 
questionnaires may be of a sensitive nature assessing participants’ alcohol or drug 
use. Participants will be told that they may refuse to answer, however, re fusal may

will be kept confidential.  
16.2 Access to Participants :  
Participants will be referred from Study 1: Observation Study and may also b e 
recruited locally through advertisements   
17.0 Consent Process 
Consent Process (when consent will be obtained): The consenting process will tak e place 
at the University of Hawai ’i Cancer Center. The Japanese American participants will have 
been initially been briefed regarding the potential to be part of S tudy 2. They are told 
that after the analysis of the biomarker samples we will determine if t hey meet the 
eligibility criteria for Study 2 and if so, we would contact them b y phone with 
information about the study. They can determine if they are interes ted in being 
screened for the study at that time. Only participants who agreed to be contacted 
regarding the second study will be recruited.  
At the screening visit, the Research Assistant will present a PowerPoint that  describes 
the study in detail. The participant will have ample time to read the consent form, ask 
questions and receive answers. The participant will respond to several qu estions 
regarding the purpose, procedures and risks of the study prior to signing  the consent 
forms. Afterwards, the screening procedures can commence. 
18.0 Setting

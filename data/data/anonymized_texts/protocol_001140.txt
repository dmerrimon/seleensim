Page 8 of 28 Revised: May 1, 20206. Objectives* 
Uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) is a proven minimally invasive and uterine 
sparing technique for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids. The procedure is 
associated with significant post procedure cramping along with nausea and vomiting 
which require a high dose of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAID) 
and IV patient controlled analgesia with opioids. This can sometimes translate to 
increased length of hospital stay, and the possibility of readmission [1, 2]. Recently, 
a study by Kim, et. al., has shown that the use of preprocedural oral dexamethasone 
decreases these clinically apparent side effects seen following UFE [3].  
 
In this proposed randomized double blind placebo control trial, we propose the use 
of intra-arterial dexamethasone, delivered directly to the uterine arteries at the time 
of embolization for the treatment of post-UFE pain and post-embolization syndrome. 
We hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory effects from the high dose of steroids 
delivered directly to the uterus, bypassing the first pass metabolism and systemic 
dilution, will lead to lower pain scores, decline in narcotic use, lower incidence of 
nausea and vomiting and shorter hospital stay.
The specific aims of the study are:
1. To assess the efficacy of intra-arterially delivered dexamethasone for the 
alleviation of post-procedural pain following UFE.
2. To assess the efficacy of intra-arterially delivered dexamethasone for the 
alleviation of post embolization syndrome in UFE. 
3. To compare the fibroid volume change, symptom relief and patient 
satisfaction from UFE between patients who received steroids versus those 
who did not.  
7. Background*
Occurring in over half of all women, uterine fibroids are the most common tumor of 
the female reproductive tract [4]. While most women remain asymptomatic, those 
with symptomatic uterine fibroids suffer from pain, pelvic pressure, menorrhagia, 
urinary frequency and infertility [5]. Not surprisingly, such women have 
- Study #: 20200788        Effective Date: 9/14/2023
IRB Study Number:                      Version: 05282020  Date: 05/28/2020
Page 9 of 28 Revised: May 1, 2020significantly lower health-care quality of life scores [6, 7]. Current management 
options include medical, surgical, and minimally invasive procedures. 
The initial medical management of symptomatic fibroids is pharmacologic, with the 
first-line treatment being oral contraceptives (OCPs). However, these are generally 
used to regulate menstrual cycles and have not been shown to reduce the overall 
volume of the fibroid [8]. In fact, 25% of women with symptomatic fibroids who are 
medically managed will go on to have a hysterectomy [9]. Gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone agonists (GnRHa) inhibits the production of estrogen and can shrink 
fibroids, but they are associated with serious side effects such as menopause like 
symptoms, osteoporosis and hirsutism. When GnRHa are stopped, the fibroids 
normally grow back [10].
Hysterectomy is considered the definitive treatment for symptomatic uterine 
fibroids. In 2005, of all the hysterectomies performed in the United States 
(~200,000) in women less than 45 years, 25% were for fibroids. Surgery is of course 
not without risk and two thirds of hysterectomies performed are still performed via 
open surgery [11]. Hysterectomy is also associated with significant morbidity and 
longer recovery period. Infection, abdominal herniation, injuries to the bowel or 
urinary system, hormonal changes that effect mood/weight, the possibility of 
hirsutism if an oophorectomy is included, and the inability to conceive are all 
associated complications. 
Since it was first introduced into the United States in the late 90’s, UFE has presented 
women with a non-surgical, minimally invasive, and uterine-sparing option for the 
treatment of their symptomatic fibroids [12]. Since then, multiple randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) have shown similar efficacy of UFE compared to 
hysterectomy. One of the initial studies, the EMbolization versus hysterectoMY 
(EMMY) trial, found that patients recovered and returned to work significantly 
sooner in the UFE cohort, and that there was no difference in symptom relief at 2 
years between the two groups [13-15]. Other studies, such as the Randomized Trial 
of Embolization versus Surgical Treatment for Fibroids (REST) found that UFE 
patients recovered more quickly and had less pain than surgery patients. At 1 year, 
both groups had similar degrees of improvement in health-related qualify of life and 
had similar levels of satisfaction. A third study, found that patients who underwent 
UFE rather than hysterectomy additionally had a shorter hospital stay, thus 
highlighting some of the financial benefits of UFE [16]. Further, several clinical 
trials have shown an increased complication rate and lower patient satisfaction 
scores for those women who underwent hysterectomy for the treatment of their 
fibroids, as opposed to Uterine Artery Embolization (UFE) [17, 18].
- Study #: 20200788        Effective Date: 9/14/2023
IRB Study Number:                      Version: 05282020  Date: 05/28/2020
Page 10 of 28 Revised: May 1, 2020One of the major side effects of UFE is the pain and cramping that patients 
experience after the procedure, which is most pronounced in the first 12-24 hours. 
Therefore, much interest has been placed on determining what causes pain following 
UFE and how best to alleviate it. Some studies have addressed the timing and nature 
of post-UFE pain, with a finding that the initial pain is due to uterine myometrial 
ischemia [19, 20]. Later at about 72 hours, some patients begin to report loss of 
appetite, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue - a constellation of symptoms termed post-
embolization syndrome (PES). PES can lead to readmission in up to 10% of patients 
[2]. Hence, there appears to be two distinct phases of pain in the post-UFE patient: 
1. The immediate ischemic pain, and later, 2. The PES symptom constellation. 
Treatment of post-UFE pain and PES has largely focused on the use of non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), narcotics, antiemetics, intra-arterially 
delivered lidocaine, and most recently with dexamethasone. It is this last option that 
has shown a decrease in both pain scores and biomarkers of inflammation [21]. In 
this study by Kim, et. al., significant reductions in post-procedural pain were 
achieved with a single intravenous dose of 10mg of dexamethasone in without any 
reported complications [3]. Our hypothesis is primarily based on this Randomized 
study. Instead of giving the steroid orally, administration into uterine artery will lead 
to a high dose of drug reaching the myometrium, bypassing the first pass metabolism 
and systemic drug dilution. We hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory effects of the 
high dose dexamethasone will have a significant beneficial effect on the post 
procedural pain and PES.
As a single administration, even at high doses, dexamethasone has very favorable 
efficacy and side effect profiles for the treatment of a wide range of conditions, 
including inflammation, pain, and nausea [22]. In fact, a recent study involving a 
single IV dose of dexamethasone was shown to significantly decrease PES following 
embolization of liver tumors [23]. 
Delivering dexamethasone directly to the uterus during a UFE has several 
advantages: bypassing of the first-pass metabolism, the lack of systemic dilution, 
and importantly, the direct delivery to the targeted region of ischemia and source of 
pain- i.e. the same tissue receiving embolic agent will also receive dexamethasone.  
This will also be administered as a single dose, eliminating the need for a steroid 
taper. This is a relatively cheap intervention (cost of Dexamethasone $1.22 USD per 
dose) which could potentially save money by decreasing the length of hospital stay 
and transitioning of UFE to an ambulatory/outpatient procedure. Additionally, a 
concurrent decrease in the incidence of PES should translate to a lower readmission 
- Study #: 20200788        Effective Date: 9/14/2023
IRB Study Number:                      Version: 05282020  Date: 05/28/2020
Page 11 of 28 Revised: May 1, 2020rate. If true, this work may also have a social impact in that fewer narcotics would 
be required to control pain. Here we propose a clinical trial designed to address these 
questions, and if proven true, could be adopted as a standard of practice to this 
uterine-sparing minimally-invasive procedure.
8. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*
All eligible women, in whom UFE is not inherently contraindicated, will be screened 
based on the following Inclusion/Exclusion criteria during their initial clinic 
appointment to discuss UFE. This will consist of a standardized questionnaire 
administered with participation from the primary physician and utilize standardized 
teach-back techniques to ensure patient understanding [24]. 
Inclusion: Women aged 20-50 years, undergoing UFE for symptomatic fibroids.  
Exclusion: Women aged <20 or >50 years, those pregnant or actively attempting to 
conceive, those deemed mentally impaired to make their own medical 
decisions, previous documented allergy to dexamethasone, those currently 
taking daily steroids for any reason, those with diabetes or deemed to be pre-
diabetic, those with contraindications for angiography, and prisoners.
9. Number of Subjects*
The power calculation is primarily based on the paper from Kim et al, which 
evaluated the effect of IV dexamethasone for treatment of post UFE pain and PES 
[3]. Based on this study, the mean Visual Analogue Scale for the Dexamethasone 
group was 2.89 (SD 1.09) compared to 3.91 (SD 2) for controls. However, in 
contrast to the reference study, the proposed study utilizes intraarterial drug 
delivery directly into uterus instead of IV routedrug , which results in higher 
concentration in the uterus [25-27]. For a low flow organ such as uterus, 
intraarterial delivery of a low clearance drug such as dexamethasone will result in a 
regional advantage of 10-25 times compared to IV or oral delivery as shown by 
Daemen et al. [25]. Given the significantly enhanced organ drug concentration in 
the uterus, an increase in effect size of at least 50% is expected with intraarterial 
drug administration compared to IV route. To detect a difference 50% larger 
between control group and intervention group, using a two-sample t test with 
significance level of 0.05, sample size of 21 per group will provide us with 86% 
statistical power to detect such an effect size.

Page 12 of 28 Revised: May 1, 202010. Study-Wide Recruitment Methods*
As with the discussion of Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, participants will be 
introduced to the study at the time of their initial clinical visit (referred for UFE 
through typical channels), and once they have already met criteria for undergoing a 
UFE for symptomatic fibroids. The patients will not be actively recruited for this 
study, per say, but will be offered admission to it providing they meet criteria. 
11. Study Timelines*
We intend to start the study by 10/2020 and to complete recruitment in 2 years, 
completing in 10/2022
Unless a patient chooses to opt-out of the study, a participant’s duration will be 
limited to a total of 15 days beyond the procedural date. This will include periodic 
assessments of a subjective and objective measure, as outlined later in this proposal. 
Enrollment and data analysis will be conducted on a rolling basis and deemed 
complete upon either meeting the primary endpoints (detailed below) or in the face 
of severe adverse events related to the procedural modification (detailed below).  
12. Study Endpoints*
Primary end point of this study is post procedure pain. As such, pain is measured 
using a modified Visual Analogue Score (VAS), a numerical rating system that each 
patient assigns to their level of pain, at a particular time [28]. The study endpoints 
will include qualitative and quantitative collection of data. Pain following UFE is 
subjective and unique to each patient and can be based on the location, number of 
the fibroid(s) and the volume of fibroid(s). A modified VAS, termed UFE Pain and 
PES Survey, will be utilized to assess pain prior to and following the procedure (Pre, 
immediately after the procedure, and periodically for the next 13 days, as described 
below). Our primary endpoint will be a 3-point decrease in the UFE Pain & PES 
score between test and controls. 
Secondary endpoints will include assessment of PES based on the measurement of 
nausea, vomiting, subjective fevers or chills, subjective data obtained from return to 
work times and readmission rates. This will be assessed in part using our UFE Pain 
and PES Survey, which includes a previously validated numerical scoring system

Page 13 of 28 Revised: May 1, 2020(0-3) to categorize nausea and vomiting, as well as a “Yes” or “No” scoring system 
to evaluate subjective fevers or chills.  
13. Procedures Involved*
The Uterine Artery Embolization procedure with the proposed intervention is 
detailed below, italicized section denotes the interventions which are additions to the 
standard of care. The procedure is separated into Pre-Procedure Assessment and 
Imaging, Uterine Artery Embolization Procedure, and Post-Procedure Assessment 
and Imaging. 
Pre-Procedure Assessment and Imaging:
●All accepted UFE study participants will be initially assessed using the attached UFE Pain 
& PES Survey to ascertain their current baseline pain. 
●Current medication requirements (e.g. OCPs, NSAIDs, narcotics, anti-emetics) will also 
be assessed at this time. 
●Basic laboratory studies will be conducted at this time. This will include a Complete 
Metabolic Panel (CMP), Complete Blood Counts (CBC), Hemoglobin A1c, and qualitative 
urine pregnancy test (UPT).  
●Each patient will further undergo (or have recent) pre-procedural imaging to determine 
fibroid burden, approximate volume, and arterial anatomy. This should be an MRI of the 
pelvis.  
Uterine Embolization Procedure:
No changes are proposed to the standard UFE procedure except for the intraarterial 
delivery of dexamethasone.

Page 14 of 28 Revised: May 1, 2020Pre-UFE patients will receive the following medications for conscious sedation, pain 
control and nausea/vomiting during the procedure as per the standard departmental 
protocol, unless contraindicated: 
●50-300 mg IV Fentanyl 
●0.5- 3.0 mg IV Versed 
●30 mg IV Toradol 
●1 g IV acetaminophen
Procedure technique:
No changes are proposed to the standard UFE procedure except for the intraarterial 
delivery of dexamethasone. 
Common femoral or radial artery access is used for the procedure. Using a 
combination of base catheters, microcatheters and different wires, each uterine artery 
is catheterized and angiograms are performed. Following this, prior to embolization, 
5 mg of IV dexamethasone or placebo are injected via the microcatheter placed in 
the uterine artery. This is followed by particle embolization using particles of size 
ranging from 500-1000µM, until near stasis as per standard technique. The same 
procedure is then repeated on the contralateral uterine artery. Finally, catheters and 
sheaths will be removed and hemostasis achieved at the access sites using closure 
device or manual compression. Patients will be admitted to the general medicine 
ward for overnight observation.
Post-UFE patients will receive the following pain/anti-emetic regimen post 
procedure: 
Inpatient Medications
●30 mg IV Ketorolac q6h
●650 mg PO Acetaminophen q6h (continued for 4 days post procedure)
●0.2 mg demand dose, 10 minute lockout, 1.2 mg/hour, Hydromorphone PCA 
●4 mg IV Ondansetron q6h PRN
Discharge Medications
●650 mg PO Acetaminophen q6h (4 days post procedure, then q12h)
●800 mg PO Ibuprofen q6h (4 days post procedure, then q12h)
●5/325 mg PO Percocet q6h PRN
●100 mg PO Docusate Sodium (Colace) q12h (4 days post procedure, then PRN)
●4 mg SL Ondansetron q6h PRN

Study Design: 
This study is designed as a double blinded, placebo controlled randomized control 
trial. As previously mentioned, the study will divide the patients into two groups. 
The test group will receive intra-procedural intra-arterial dexamethasone and the 
control group, a saline placebo. Block randomization (Size: 8) will be done using a 
random number generator. 
The drug or placebo will be prepared by research pharmacy and be delivered to the 
Interventional Radiology Department in identical containers with specific serial 
numbers. The physician performing the UFE, the patient and the research team will 
be unaware of the nature of the administered drug/placebo or the patient grouping. 
The drug preparation will be coordinated by the University of Miami Pharmacy 
Department’s Research Coordinator, Daniel W. Nobel. Once the uterine artery is 
catheterized, the drug or placebo will be injected intra-arterially. Embolization is 
then performed as usual. 
Following UFE, all patients will be admitted to the general inpatient unit for 
observation, as is standard of care for all UFE patients. Following this observation 
period, patients will be discharged with appropriate instructions of when and how to 
follow-up with the treatment team. This will include explicit instructions to self-
monitoring for unusual bleeding, swelling, bruising at the femoral artery access site, 
abnormal uterine bleeding, cramping, extended bouts of nausea, vomiting, fever, 
chills, and malaise. All patients will be given the number of an on-call physician for 
questions and concerns they may have. As mentioned above, all patients will be 
telephoned daily by a member of the research team on day 2, 3, 4, and 7 post-UFE.

Page 16 of 28 Revised: May 1, 2020All patients will have a routine 2 week post-procedural phone call to review their 
symptoms, 1 month clinic visit and then 3 month clinic visit after MRI imaging. 
All data collected from the Surveys will be stored and analyzed as described 
elsewhere in this proposal. Again, we expect that this study will reach its recruitment 
goal and Primary Endpoint in approximately 2 years.
To evaluate specific aim 1: 
Pain will be assessed using 11 point visual analog scale as below:
The visual analog pain score will be documented as follows:
oTime 0 Immediately prior to the procedure
o1 hour intervals for the first 3 hours
o3 hour intervals for the next 9 hours 
o6 hour intervals for the next 12 hours
oDaily, for the next 3 days 
oOnce at day 7
First 3 of those surveys will be done in the recovery area. The amount of narcotic 
use from PCA pump will also be recorded.
To evaluate specific aim 2: 
Post embolization syndrome will be assessed as reporting of nausea, vomiting and 
pain scores, that will be assessed at least twice during the day of the procedure and 
then daily for the next 3 days and then at 7 days. We will utilize our previously 
mentioned UFE Pain and PED Survey.
To evaluate specific aim 3: 
Symptom relief, patient satisfaction and fibroid volume change will be measured 
through the completion of a UFE health-related quality of life (QOL) survey, UFE 
QOL Survey, prior to the procedure and then at 1 month and 3 month after procedure.
Uterine volume will be compared from the pre-procedure and 3 month post 
procedure MRI using volumetric software.
14. Data and Specimen Banking*
No specimen will be collected or stored. Data will be kept in password protected, 
HIPAA compliant University approved Box folder, accessible only to investigators.

Page 17 of 28 Revised: May 1, 202015. Data Management*
All data will be stored, accessed, and analyzed utilizing server and computer 
workstations previously approved as HIPAA compliant. Data will be kept in 
password protected, HIPAA compliant University approved Box folder, accessible 
only to investigators. Anonymized data will include age, pre and post MRI imaging, 
UFE Pain & PES Survey, narcotic use, vital signs, subjective reports of nausea, 
vomiting, daily dietary intake, bowel movements, length of hospital stay, 
readmission rate, and days to return to baseline.  
A single computer system managed by the Pharmacology Research Coordinator, 
Daniel W. Nobel, will be maintained to ensure blinding of the cohorts. Collected 
data will be analyzed by Prasoon Mohan, MD, and done so prior to unblinding.  
16. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of 
Subjects*
All data will be analyzed as it arrives and on a rolling basis by the primary physicians 
and researchers directly involved in this study, to ensure that the clinical findings 
and participant reported responses to the Pain & UFE Survey are not deviating in a 
way that could lead to undue harm. 
As stated previously, all participants will be admitted to the hospital for observation 
for the first 24 hours and discharged with 2-week clinical follow-up in place and the 
contact information of a research team member. All participants will be contacted 
daily for the first 3 days, then at 7 and 14 days following the procedure. Any adverse 
effects of safety issues would be discovered in this follow up.
At 6 months we will analyze the interim data for any difference in the efficacy of 
treatment between the groups. All data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS software. 
We will use Student’s T test for analysis of continuous variables, Chi square test for 
categorical variables with significance level set at two tailed p value of <0.05. 
Although we expect that this trial exposes the participants to minimal risk, we 
consider the following statistically-significant differences between the two arms to 
be grounds for immediate trial termination: excessive abnormal uterine bleeding, 
infection, and sepsis.

Page 18 of 28 Revised: May 1, 202017. Withdrawal of Subjects*
Subjects will be immediately withdrawn if it is deemed at any time prior to the 
procedure date that they fall into any of the previously outlined Exclusion criteria, 
suffer an intra-procedural adverse reaction to the use of dexamethasone, or willingly 
choose to leave the trial at any time. 
Once terminated from the trial, a subject can continue to undergo a UFE if they both 
meet the previously prescribed criteria and choose to do so. If a subject chooses to 
withdrawal post-UFE, a termination letter will be issued to their current address and 
all attained medical documents will be delivered through standard channels to their 
Primary Care Provider / referring physician. They can continue to receive standard 
post-UFE follow-up care through the University of Miami Interventional Radiology 
Department, if they so choose and without any punitive consequences. This is 
outlined in the Study Consent Form.    
18. Risks to Subjects*
In this study, patients will be asked to assume the standard risks associated with 
UFE. These include known complications of bleeding, infection, adverse reaction to 
contrast agent, pain, need for further intervention/embolization. Further, there is a 
additional risk with the addition of a single dose of dexamethasone, as below which 
will be explained to patients. 
Even at large doses, dexamethasone is known to have an excellent safety profile, 
with few adverse effects. Of those reported, anaphylaxis is exceedingly rare 
(incidence of ~ 0.1%) and the risk of transient hyperglycemia should be mitigated 
by the exclusion of pre-diabetic and diabetic patients (Determined by Hemoglobin 
A1c percentage) [29, 30]. It is important to note that there is no increased risk for 
delayed wound healing or infection in surgical patients receiving a single dose of 
dexamethasone [30]. Further, as a single dose will be administered, there is no need 
for a dedicated taper as suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis does 
not occur until weeks of steroid therapy.

Page 19 of 28 Revised: May 1, 202019. Potential Benefits to Subjects*
If observed, the major benefit to women participating in the dexamethasone arm of 
this study will be a fall in pain level and PES following UFE. Other benefits may be 
a faster recovery and faster return to work or baseline activity.

23. Sharing of Results with Subjects*
All imaging findings, diagnostic studies, complications, and follow-up treatments 
will be shared with both patient and their appointed primary care/obstetrics 
physicians. However, the study will remain blinded to both patient and clinician until 
the study is deemed closed, an adverse event occurs, or the study is prematurely 
terminated for any of the reasons previously stated. Any shared health information 
will be done so utilizing HIPAA-compliant channels.  
24. Setting
Recruitment will occur in our already-established Interventional Radiology clinics 
located at University of Miami, at the professional arts center (PAC). Likewise, UFE 
procedures will be carried out at University of Miami Health Towers or University 
of Miami Hospital and Clinics or Lennar Foundation Medical center, utilizing 
similar or identical equipment and the previously stated methods. Data analysis will

participants are not placed at undue risk.    
25. Resources Available
The below members will meet monthly and on an as-needed basis, share all data via 
a University-approved means, a shared Box folder. This will include this IRB 
proposal, the Study Consent Form, the Patient Information Packet, and a data 
spreadsheet to compile the UFE Pain & PES Survey scores. The Principal 
Investigator shall have the responsibility of coordinating the study effort, and 
together with the Participating Physicians shall be responsible for the UFE 
procedures and the monitoring of study participants to ensure safety. This will 
include coordination between the Advanced Care Practitioners and the Research 
Coordinator to monitor for any participant adverse events. The Clinical Pharmacist 
will be responsible for compounding the Dexamethasone and Saline placebo, as well 
as blinding the study by assigning serial numbers to the medicine vials.

All approvals have been granted by the Vascular and Interventional Radiology 
Department at the University of Miami for this study. This includes funding for a 
dedicated Research Coordinator and the costs associated with compounding the 
materials required in the study. 
27. Recruitment Methods
Recruitment will occur at the first clinical encounter between Physician and Patient 
in the IR clinic. Patients considering UFE generally placed in contact with the 
Vascular and Interventional Radiology team through a standard physician referral 
system. Referring physicians typically include Obstetric/Gynecologic specialists, 
Hospitalist, Emergency Physicians, and Primary Care Practitioners. Patients are seen 
in clinic prior to determining candidacy for the procedure and it is at this time that 
the research is introduced. If deemed a candidate for a UFE (please see listing of 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria), participants will be introduced to the study utilizing 
the same simplified language and pelvic models currently utilized to describe the

30. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
All aforementioned members of this clinical trial hold certain responsibilities to the 
privacy and comfort of the participants. As such, real-time transparency of incoming 
clinical data and patient concerns will be compiled in a shared, password protected 
University Box Folder for monitoring by all. However, some members will be 
restricted in their access to HIPAA-protected materials. This will include Ancillary 
Staff members and those not directly involved in the daily care of the participant. 
The topics of Privacy, Comfort, and Patient Rights will be explicitly discussed 
during every patient encounter to ensure that ongoing participant-membership 
remains voluntary  in the eyes of the patient. This will include a discussion about the 
right to withdrawal from the study without penalization.

ol Version 2.0: CV -18-10 v 3.2: 17-Apr -17 5 1 Introduction 
CooperVision, (CVI) is extending the power range of the commercially available Biofinity silicone 
hydrogel contact lenses to include multifocal toric silicone hydrogel contact lenses (Biofinity MFT). 
This study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the Biofinity MFT lenses. 
2 Study Objective 
The objective of this non -dispensing clinical study is to compare the  clinical performance of  
Biofinity Multifocal Toric (BF MFT) with Proclear Multifocal Toric (PC MFT) contact lenses . 
The primary  variable of interest is: 
•Visual acuity  (VA)
The secondary variable of interest is: 
•Subjective assessments of visual performance
2.1 Study Hypothesis 
The study hypothesis i s that the Biofinity Multifocal Toric  lenses will not be clinically inferior to 
Proclear Multifocal Toric  lenses.  
3 Study Design 
This non- dispensing , subject masked, randomized, bilateral crossover study will compare the clinical 
performance of Biofinity Multifocal Toric contact  lenses.  
This study will be  composed of two parts. Part A will involve a screening/baseline visit for the 
determination of subject’s contact lens prescription based on their spectacle refraction. With the 
information  obtained from Part A, Biofinity Multifocal Toric and Proclear Multifocal Toric contact 

Confidential   
Protoc
ol Version 2.0: CV -18-10 v 3.2: 17-Apr -17 6 lenses will be made to order on a per -patient basis for use in Part B  to assess the clinical 
performance of the lenses.  
Subjects must be able to participate in both parts of the study ; Part A of the study will last 
approximately 1-2 hours duration and Part B will last  approximately 3-4 hours duration.    
4 Ethics Review / Statement of Compliance  
4.1 Relevant Standards / Guidelines 
This implementation document  has been developed in accordance with the following:  
•ISO 14155 Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects
•21 CFR 812.2(b) Investigational Device Exemption – Abbreviated Requirements
•ISO 11980 Contact Lens and Lens Care products – Guidance for Clinical Investigations
•ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice
•Declaration of Helsinki
4.2 Institutional Review Board 
This study will be conducted in accordance with Institutional Review Board regulations (U.S. 21CFR 
Part 56.103) or applicable IEC regulations. Copies of all IRB/IEC correspondence with the 
investigator/sponsor will be kept on file. 
The c
onduct of this study will be approved by Sterling Institutional Review Board prior to 
commencement.  
4.3 Informed Consent 
Informed consent shall be obtained in writing from the subject and the process shall be documented 
before any procedure specific to the clinical investigation is carried out.  
5 Clinical Trial Registration 
This study will be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov in accordance with Section 801of the Food and Drug Administration Act (FDAA) which mandates the registration of certain clinical trials of drugs 
and medical devices.  
Confidential   
Protoc
ol Version 2.0: CV -18-10 v 3.2: 17-Apr -17 7 6 Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
There might not be direct benefits to the subjects in this study. However, participation in a study 
may contribute to scientific research information that may be used in the development of new contact lens products. In addition, subjects will receive an examination of the front part of their eyes and may have the opportunity to try a different type of soft contact lenses and/or different lens care products at no cost to them .  
The investigational contact lenses used in this study are intended for daily wear (NOT extended wear) with usage of up to four hours only, in contrast to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for 
daily wear lenses. In addition, this study is a non- dispensing study, meaning the lenses are not 
dispensed to subjects to take home and lens wear will be monitored closely by the investigators.  
This study is considered to be a non- significant risk study based on United State Food and Drug 
administration (FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines due to no potential 
of serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact lenses include discomfort, dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include photophobia, iritis, corneal edem a and eye infection. Although contact 
lens-related infections are very infrequent, the possibility does exist.  The incidence of infection due 
to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection will occur only in one eye.  This risk 
is assumed by 35  million Americans who currently wear contact lenses. 
Routine clinical procedures including auto-refraction, auto -keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular 
health assessment, and contact lens fitting may be used. In addition, high magnification imagi ng of 
the lens fit may be made using 35 mm or digital cameras.

 16 8 Adverse Event  Reporting 
8.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is considered to be device- related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated 
adverse device effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant  adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant 
adverse events,’ as defined below.  
 
 
 AE classification, coding (for reporting to the sponsor) and examples are provided in the following table of Contact Lens Adverse Event Classification and Reporting  table:  
 
Code  Condition  Reporting  
Serious Adverse Events  
01 Presumed infectious keratitis or infectious corneal ulcer  
Notify sponsor as 
soon as possible, 
within 24 hours; 
IRB reporting as 
per requirements  02 Permanent loss of ≥ 2 lines of best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA)  
03 Corneal injury that results in permanent opacification within central cornea 
(6mm)  
04 Uveitis or Iritis (e.g. presence of anterior segment inflammation as described 
in ISO 11980, Annex B)  
05 Endophthalmitis  
06 Hyphema Classification  Definition  
Serious Adverse 
Event  Those events that are life -threatening, or result in permanent impairment of a body 
function, or permanent damage to a body structure or necessitate medical (therapeutic) or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
Significant 
Adverse Event  Those non- serious adverse events that occur with contact lens usage that  are not 
sight -threatening but are usually symptomatic and may warrant therapeutic 
management and /or temporary or permanent discontinuation of contact lens wear.  
Non- Significant 
Adverse Events  Those less severe non -serious adverse events that occur with contact lens usage 
that are not sight -threatening, may or may not be symptomatic and may warrant 
palliative management, such as ocular lubricants or temporary  interruption of contact 
lens wear.  
Unanticipated 
Adverse Device 
Effect  Adverse events in a clinical trial that were not previously identified in the protocol in 
terms of nature, severity, or degree of incidence. An Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect is an unanticipated adverse event that is serious in nature and caused 
by or associated with the device and is considered reportable.

23 Asymptomatic corneal infiltrative events  
24 Any sign and/or symptom for which temporary lens discontinuation for > 1 day 
is recommended (if not already classified)  
20 Other sign and/or symptom warranting classification as a non -significant 
adverse event  
Normal or adaptive symptoms  
Transient symptoms such as end -of-day dryness, lens awareness, itching or burning or other 
discomfort may occur with contact lens wear and may occasionally reduce wearing time. These are 
not reported as adverse events unless in the investigator’s opinion they are unexpected in 
nature, severe or have a high rate of occurrence.  
 This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes , such as 
comfort, vision or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as Adverse Events.  
8.2 Procedures for Adverse Events 
Treatment of an adverse event will depend on its nature and severity. Based on the clinical judgment of the investigator the subject  may be referred to an ophthalmologist for treatment. The investigator 
will attempt to determine whether the reaction is related to the test device or a result of other factors. 
Confidential     
Protocol Version 2.0: CV -18-10   v 3.2: 17-Apr -17 
 
 18 An Adverse Event Form will be completed for each adverse event. If both eyes are involved, a separate Adverse Event Form will be completed for each eye . Whenever possible, the adverse 
event will be photo- documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by the sponsor 
(bills and prescription receipts kept). The subject  must be followed until resolution and a written 
report completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
 
8.3 Reporting Adverse Events  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly rel ated 
to subject participation will be reported to the Principal Investigator and the sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. The Principal Investigator will report the event to the IRB as soon as possible (by fax, mail/delivery, phone, or email).   All fatal or life threatening 
events will be reported immediately to the IRB.  
Significant and Non -Significant Adverse Events will be reported to the sponsor as soon as possible, 
but no later than 5 working days after the occurrence.

 19 9 Device Malfunctions  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or 
otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens  that is likely to cause or contribute to a Serious 
Adverse Event should be reported to the Principal Investigator and the sponsor within 24 hours of 
the investigator becoming aware of the malfunction. 
 
Other defective lenses should be reported to the Sponsor as soon as possible.  
 This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as complaints or Device M alfunctions.  
 
10 Statistical Analysis  
10.1 Statistical Plan  
Summary statistics will be produced (e.g. mean, standard deviation). Paired t test will be used to compare slit lamp biomicroscopy, lens fit and subjective scores between study lens types.  Repeated Meas ures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or paired analysis will be used to compare the variables 
between study visits. The critical alpha level for statistical significance will be set at p ≤ 0.05, with 
adjustment for multiple comparisons.  
 All participants who were evaluated will be used  in the analysis. In the event of missing data, 
individual data points will be excluded in the analysis and not extrapolated from the collected data.  
11 Data Quality Assurance

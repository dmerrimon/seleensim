1.0. STUDY OBJEC TIVES  
 
The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of two  commercially available weight loss 
programs, TSFL and M EDD, each compa red to a  self-directed control di et, on changes in bo dy 
weight in apparently healthy overweight and ob ese men and wom en. 
 
2.0. TRI AL DESIGN AND VISIT STRUCTU RE 
 
This r andom ized, controll ed, 16-week parallel study includ es one screening visit (Visit 1; week - 
1), one  baseline visit (Visit 2; week 0), and five  clinic visits (Visits 3,4,5,6,  and 7; w eeks 2, 4,  8, 
12, and 16).  Subjects will be random ly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to one  of the thr ee groups  (TSFL 
Program Group, MEDD  Program Group, or  Cont rol Group) with in whi ch the subj ects will 
receive the following interventions: 
 
 TSFL Program Group:  The TSFL Program group will  be assigned to the Optimal 
Weight 5 &  1 Plan™ for weight loss.  This is  a portion-controll ed, nutritional ly balanced, 
low calorie weight loss meal plan (800-1000 kcal/day) that consists  of five M edifast meal 
replacements, one  lean and green meal, and one  optional snack each day. The Medifast 
meal replacements are nutrient d ense and fortified with 24 v itamins and m inerals to 
ensure  adequate mi cronutrient nutrit ion while on a  calorie restrict ed meal plan. All 
Medi fast meal replacements share a similar nutritional p rofile, allowing them to be used 
interchangeably. All M edifast meal replacements  required for the meal plan will  be 
provided to the TS FL Group p articip ants throughout the 16-week weight loss pe riod of 
the stu dy.  The  lean and green meal is a self-prepared meal consis ting of a specified 
amount  of lean protein, non-starchy vegetables, and healthy fats.  Particip ants will  
purchase and prepare foods used for the lean and green meals on their  own.  Addit ionally, 
the M edifast Flavors of Hom e® produ cts offer a “heat and serve” alternative to the self- 
prepared lean and green meal for occasional use.  TSFL particip ants will  receive up to six 
Flavors of Home  products per  month during the study.   TS FL particip ants will receive a 
list of self-selected foods  (purchased by the p articip ants) that can be used for the optional 
snack.  In addition, pa rticipants will also be  provided with up to two bo xes (i.e., 14 
individual p ackets) of  Medifast snacks wh ich can serve as a portable, pre-portioned, 
ready-to-eat alternate snack opt ion. 
 
This T SFL group will  have regularly scheduled  coaching sessions sta rting at Vis it 2 
(week 0) with an assigned research assistant tr ained to fun ction as a TSFL coach 
(hereinafter referred to as  the TSFL Coach) for the duration of  the stu dy.  The TSFL 
coach training will take place before the study and will utilize a training protocol m imetic 
of current training received by new TS FL Coaches.  The  coaching schedules and  content 
will meet the TSFL coaching stand ards of  practice. Coaching, for the p urpose of this 
study, will  take place via telephon e.  The  initial coaching session (45 min in len gth) will 
occur the day of Visit 2 (week 0) as participants will be instru cted to st art their weight 
loss program on the day following  the random ization visit  (day 1).  If the coaching 
session do es not take  place, participants will  be instructed to st art their weight loss 
program on d ay 1 regardless (a proto col deviation fo rm must be subm itted).  Particip ants 
will have access to TS FL written suppo rt tools and month ly e-mailed newsletters 
throu ghout the study to assist with w eight loss. Particip ants will  also have  limited

telephone  and e-mail a ccess during  the study to the Medifast Nutrition Suppo rt Team 
(available when a question exceeds the  scope of the TSFL Coach training), which is 
consistent with the commercially available program. 
 
 
 MEDD  Program Group: Particip ants random ized to the MEDD  group will be assigned 
to the Medifast Achieve™ Plan (4 & 2 & 1 Plan®) for weight loss.  The  Achieve  Plan is a 
portion -controll ed, nutritional ly balanced, reduced energy (1100-1300 k cal/day) meal 
plan th at consis ts of four Medi fast meal replacements, two lean and green meals, and one 
healthy snack. The Medifast meal replacements and the lean and green meals are the 
same as tho se described above  for the TSFL Group.  Briefly, Medifast meal replacements 
are portion -controll ed, nutrient dens e, and fortified with 24 v itamins and minerals. All 
Medi fast meal replacements share a similar nutritional p rofile, allowing them to be used 
interchangeably. Medifast meal replacements r equired for  the program wi ll be provided 
to the MEDD  Group p articip ants throughout the study.  The  lean and green meal is a self- 
prepared me al consist ing of  a spe cified amount  of lean protein, no n-starchy vegetables, 
and healthy fats. Participants will  purchase and prepare foods us ed for the lean and green 
meals on their  own.  Additional ly, the Medifast Flavors of Home® products offer a “heat 
and serve” alternative to the self-prepared lean and green meal for occasional use.  
MEDD  particip ants will  receive up to twelve Flavors of Home p roducts per  month during 
the stu dy.  The  healthy snack will  consist of a  self-selected serving of fruit, d airy, or grain 
purchased by the participant, or one  of Medifast’s portable, p re-portion ed, ready-to-eat 
Medi fast snacks can be used as a he althy snack.  Particip ants will  receive up to two bo xes 
(i.e., 14 ind ividual p ackets) of Medifast snacks per month. 
 
Particip ants will  be dispens ed stu dy-specific printed mat erials (includi ng the “Getting 
Started Instru ctions”)  at Vis it 2 (week 0) and will  have one telephone  call with a M edifast 
Nutrition Suppo rt Team member  prior  to 17 :00 h EST at Visit 2 ( week 0) to receive 
instruction on t he meal plan and support mat erials as p articip ants will  be instructed to  
start their weight loss pr ogram on the day following the random ization visit  (day 1).  If 
the telephone  call does not take place, particip ants will be instructed to st art their weight 
loss program on d ay 1 regardless (a protocol dev iation form must  be submi tted). 
Particip ants will  also have  telephone  and e-mail access to the M edifast Nut rition Suppo rt 
Team and M edifast on line tools throu ghout the study.  Particip ants in the MEDD  group 
will be encourag ed to track weight and food in take and access ME DD written, online, 
and virtu al suppo rt tools to use  at their disc retion. 
 
 
 Cont rol: The Control  group will  follow a  self-directed di et, which is a  food-based, 
reduced-calorie diet, consistent with the 2015 Di etary Guid elines for Americans (See 
Supplem entary Materials).  This group will receive a one-on-one personal instru ction 
session (10-15 m in) with a t rained m ember of the study staff at the Visit 2 (week 0) clinic 
visit.  Du ring this sessi on, daily energy intake targets will  be determined for each 
particip ant us ing the National Institutes of Health body weight planner 
(www.niddk.n ih.gov/he alth-information /health-topics/wei ght-control/bo dy-weight- 
plann er/Pages/bwp. aspx).  The  personalized daily energy intake level will be sp ecific to 
each particip ant’s 1 6-week weight loss goal, targeting 7% weight loss over  the 1 6-week 
weight loss p eriod, consistent with r ecent obesi ty treatment guidelines (Jensen 2014 ). 
Particip ants will  receive publicly available in formation from the USDA C hoose MyPlate

program, including a handout wi th a meal plan from the website to match th eir target 
energy intake, as well as instruction to u tilize the www.choos emyplate.gov website. 
Particip ants with target energy intakes of <1600 kcal per day will be instructed to take  a 
multi-vitamin of th eir choosing  (not marketed to enhance or benefit weight loss, en ergy, 
metabolism, et c.) to ens ure adequate intake  of micronut rients.  Particip ants will  be 
instructed to st art their weight loss pr ogram on the day following r andom ization (day 1). 
In keeping with the self-directed n ature of this c ontrol group,  particip ants will not receive 
further instructions or p ersonal suppo rt duri ng the weight loss p eriod. 
 
3.0. SIZE OF TRIAL POPULATION  
 
A standard deviation of  15.0 lb for  change in bo dy weight over 16 weeks was derived from the 
largest variability observed in a p revious stu dy by Davis et al. (2010)  that compa red weight loss 
over 16 weeks on the  Medifast 5 &  1 Plan® ( -29.8 ± 13.0 lb) vs. a  food-based isoc aloric control 
diet (-14.3 ± 15.0 lb ).  Using this esti mate of expected v ariability and accounting for a more 
conservative mean difference in weight loss bet ween groups ov er a similar timeframe, an 
evaluable  sample of 55 participants in each group (165 total) will pro vide 80%  power to d etect a 
difference of 9.0 pounds  (an effect size d of 0.60). This assumes a  nominal α = 0.025 (two-sided) 
accounting for two primary compa risons, each Medifast group compa red to the control group, in 
order to m aintain an o verall type I error of α = 0.05.  To account f or possible  attrition, a  total 
sample of 198 particip ants will be random ized. 
 
Subjects will be random ized to one of  three groups (1:1:1 r atio) stratified by sex to ensure each 
group is allocated a  maximum  of 25% male  participants. Addit ionally, the total stu dy sample will 
be limited to ≤10% of  particip ants with a BMI between ≥27.0 and <30.0 kg/m2, but 
random ization will  not be stratified by BMI. 
 
4.0. PERS ONNEL RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA ANALYSIS 
 
Data analyses will  be carried out by personn el from Biofortis. 
 
5.0. A NALYSIS  POPULATI ONS 
 
All s tatistical analyses will be condu cted usi ng SAS® softw are for Windows ( version 9.4 or 
higher, Cary, NC).  
 
An Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population wi ll include all subjects who w ere randomized into the 
study.  A modifi ed ITT (mITT) population wi ll include all random ized participants that had at 
least one post -baseline weight measurement.  In addition, a  Comp leters population  will comprise 
subjects who w ere randomized into the stu dy and completed all clinic visits  during  the entire 16- 
week stu dy period. 
 
All de cisions r egarding population assi gnment wi ll be do cument ed prior to  database lock.  
 
6.0. PRESENTATION  OF SUBJ ECT DI SPOSITION  
 
Frequency counts and p ercentages for all subjects who are screened, randomized, complete the 
study, and dis continue early will be presented.  Information wi ll be p resented for  subjects who 
withdr aw early on the visits at which  withdrawal occurred and the int ervention condition(s) 
completed.  In addition, frequency counts and percentages of subj ects’ reported reasons for 
discontinu ation will  be summa rized.

7.0. PRESENTATION  OF SCREENI NG/BASELINE  VARIABLES 
 
Variables collected at screening (Visit 1) will be summarized and presented. In addition, v ital 
signs m easurements collected from Visits 1 to 7 wi ll also be  summa rized and presented. 
Descriptive  statistics (number  of subj ects, mean, stand ard error of the mean (SEM), medi an, 
inter-quartile lim its, minimum, and ma ximum va lues) will be p resented for the continuous 
variables. Frequency counts and p ercentages will  be presented for  the categorical variables. The 
following  variables will be p resented: 
 
  Demogr aphic characteristics: (Visit 1) 
 Gender (male, female) 
 Age (years) 
 Race (White, Black/African Am erican, Am erican Indian or Alaskan Native, Asi an or

  Vital si gns m easurements: (Visits 1 to 7)  
 Systolic blood p ressure  (mmHg) 
 Diastolic blood p ressure  (mmH g) 
 Heart rate (bpm)  
 
The chemistry and hematology profiles for each subject at s creening visit (Visit 1) will be 
reviewed by the clinical investigators (MD) and any findi ngs of clinical signifi cance will be 
document ed. No d escriptive statis tics will be generated. 
 
8.0. OUTCO ME ANALYSIS  
 
8.1. Primary Outcome Variable 
The prima ry outcome  variable will  be change (absolute and percent ch ange) in bo dy weight from 
baseline (Visit 2;  week 0) to end of  study (Visit 7;  week 16) 
 
8.2. Secondary Outcome Variables 
Secondary outcome  variables include  values of  the following  variables at post-random ization 
visits as stat ed: 
 Change (absolute and percent ch ange) in bo dy weight from baseline (Visit  2; week 0) to  
Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 (weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12)  
 Proportion of p articip ants achievi ng ≥5% and ≥10% loss of baseline body weight at each 
post-random ization visit  Visits 3, 4, 5,  6, and 7 (weeks 2, 4, 8,  12, and 16)  
Jason Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.

 Change (absolute and percent ch ange)  in the following  body composi tion parameters 
(measured via DXA) from baseline (Visit 2;  week 0) to Visi ts 4, 5, 6, and 7 (weeks 4, 8, 12, 
and 16)  
- Total fat mass (kg) 
- Total lean mass (non-bone fat free mass) (kg) 
- Percent bo dy fat (expressed as percentage of total body mass)  
- Android fat and l ean ma ss (g) 
- Gynoid fat and l ean mass (g) 
- Abdominal vis ceral fat mass (g) and volu me (cm3) 
 Absolute  change in bo dy circumference parameters from baseline (Visit 2;  week 0) to Visi ts 
4, 5, 6, and 7 (weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16) 
- Waist circumference (cm) 
- Hip circumference (cm) 
- Chest cir cumference (cm) 
- Dominant upp er arm circumference (cm) 
- Dominant th igh circumference (cm) 
- Total body circumference (sum of all five m easures) (cm) 
- Waist to hip ratio 
 Absolute  change in QoL questionnaire outcom es (domain and/or to tal scores) from baseline 
(Visit 2; week 0) to Visi ts 5 and 7 (weeks 8 and 16). QoL will be measured using  both 
RAND-36 Qu estionnaire (uses s ame qu estions as the Short Fom (36)  Health Survey 
Questionnaire (Ware JE, et al. 1992 )) and IWQOL-Lite Questionnaire. 
- RAND 36 -item Health Survey Questionnaire assesses the eight health scales: 
physical functioning (10  questions), role li mitations due  to physical health 
problems (4 qu estions), role li mitations due  to emotional problems (3 questions), 
energy/fatigue (4 questions), emotional w ell-being (5 questions), soci al 
functioning (2 questions), p ain (2 questions), and general health (5 questions). 
The scales’ scores will  be calculated as described on the RA ND website 
(http://www.rand.org/health/surv eys_tools /mos/36-item-short -form/scoring.html). 
- IWQOL-Lite Questionnaire (Kolotk in RL, et al. 2001) is a 3 1-question self report 
instrument to assess ob esity specific quality of life  and consists  of five do mains: 
Physical Function (11 questions), Self -Esteem (7 questions), Se xual Life (4 
questions), Pub lic Distress (5 qu estions),  and Work (4 questions). The  domain 
scores will be the sum of  the ratings on q uestions th at correspond to the sp ecific 
domain. A total s core (all 31 qu estions) will also be  presented. 
 Particip ant satisf action and health/well-being assessed using  the Satisfa ction and 
Health/Well-Being Questionnaire at Vis it 7 (week 16). Respons es will  be coded as follo ws: 
“1” and “2” = “Disagree”, “3”= “Neither agree nor disagree”, and “4” and “5”= Agree. 
 Absolute  change in hs-CRP from b aseline (Visit 2;  week 0) to Visit 7 (week 16)  
 Weight loss prog ram ad herence assessed at Vis its 4, 5, 6, and 7 (weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16) 
based on the Pr ogram Questionnaire. Adh erence will be calculated b ased on self-reported 
TSFL/MEDD meal replacement p roduct consumpt ion (active groups on ly) and a single 
question V AS rating adherence to their assigned weight loss pr ogram (all groups). For the 
self-reported TS FL/MEDD meal replacement p roduct consumptio n, if the  subject encircled 
“>6”, it will be coded as “7”. Also, questions (1,2)  and (4,5) of  the Program Questionnaire 
will be scored as:

9.0. STATI STICAL METH ODS 
 
Descriptive  statistics (number  of subj ects, mean, SEM, medi an, interquartile limits, minimum 
and ma ximum) will be p resented for quantitative variables. Rati ngs for categorical variables will 
be presented as counts and percentages. All tests of significance, unless otherwise stat ed, will be 
performed at alph a=0.05,  two-sided.  
 
Baseline compa risons  for demographic characteristics bet ween control and intervention groups 
will be completed with the Ch i-square test, Fisher’s exact (tw o-tail) test, or  analysis of variance 
(ANOVA), as appropriate. 
 
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess  differences among intervention groups 
in the primary and continuous se condary outcome variables at each pos t-randomization vi sit. The 
ANCOVA mod el will contain a t erm for  intervention, with s ex and baseline me asures as 
covariates. Least squares mean values and corresponding  SEM will  be derived from the final 
ANCOVA mod el for each intervention group. 
 
Counts and percentages of subjects who experience weight loss of  ≥5% and ≥10% b etween 
baseline (Visit 2) and each post-random ization visit (visits 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) will be p resented. 
Differences among intervention groups in subj ects with weight loss of ≥5%  and ≥10% will be 
assess ed usi ng a generalized linear mod el with a logit link and bino mial distribution sp ecified. 
The model will  contain a  term for intervention, with  sex as a covariate. 
 
Differences among intervention groups in ind ividual  Satisfaction and Health/Well-being 
questionnaire scores will  be assess ed usi ng a generalized linear mod el with a cumulative logit 
link and mu ltinomial distribution sp ecified.  The model will cont ain a t erm for intervention, with 
sex and absolute change in weight as covariates. 
 
For the analyses of bo dy weight, bo dy composi tion pa rameters, and bo dy circumference 
parameters, each active group will be compa red to the control group using a  step-down Dun nett 
adjustment for multiple compa risons  when a significant treatment effect is observed. Meanwhile,  
Jason Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLAN V1.8 
CONF IDENTIAL Page 11  
  
no adjustments will  be done  on control vs. a ctive compa risons  on the remaining outcome 
variables. 
 
Descriptive  statistics will  be provided for the Program Qu estionnaire ou tcomes. Also, l inear 
associ ation between change (absolute) in bo dy weight from baseline (Visit  2; week 0) to end of 
study (Visit 7;  week 16) and average meal replacements [averaged across Visits 4 to7 (weeks 4- 
16)] will be obtain ed (sp earman's rank-order correlation) for the ME DD and TS FL groups. 
Addit ionally, for the TSFL group,  linear association  between change (absolute) in bo dy weight 
from bas eline (Visit 2;  week 0) to end of study (Visit 7; week 16)  and number of coaching 
contacts will be obtain ed (spearman's rank-order correlation ). Lastly, for the MEDD  group, 
associ ation between wh ether subj ects made discretionary Nutrition Suppo rt cont act(s) or not and 
weight loss of ≥5%  will be assess ed usi ng a Fisher’s exact test. 
 
Assump tion of no rmality of residuals wi ll be inv estigated for each outco me variable at the 5% 
level of significance with  the Shapi ro-Wilk test ( Shapiro 1965 ). If the normality assumption is 
not satisfi ed, then an analysis bas ed on ranks will  be performed. 
 
10.0. MISSING  OR I NCOMPLETE  DATA 
 
For the ITT population,  a multiple impu tation method  will be implem ented if  the missing  data 
mechanism  is at l east missing at random (MAR ). Meanwhile, for the modified ITT popul ation, 
analyses with and without imputation will  be conducted. For this  imputati on, the method of  Last 
Observation Ca rried Forward (LOCF) will be us ed as a sin gle imputation app roach (Elobeid MA 
et al, 2009).  In this approach, if a  subject’s me asurement is m issing at a po st-random ization visi t, 
the v alue from the most  proximal prior visit wi ll be used for all missing visits afterwards.  The 
imputation methods  will only be applied to body weight. No i mputatio ns will be performed for 
other  variables. 
 
11.0. SAFETY  ANALYSIS 
 
Safety assessments will be d etermined from intervention-emergent AEs th at occur after 
random ization at Vis it 2 (week 0).  Possible di fferences in the numb er of particip ants with at 
least one AE will be  assessed with Chi-Square or Fisher’s exact test. 
 
Particip ants who achieve a BMI of 19.0  kg/m2 or below will  discontinue  the weight loss d iet and 
begin a mainten ance diet and will  be asked to return for  remaini ng clinic vi sits.  Th ese 
particip ants will  be noted  in the safety analysis. 
 
Vitals (blood p ressure, pulse rate) will be summa rized by group with des criptive  statistics. 
 
12.0 OUTLI ERS 
 
Individual values for the key outcome p arameters (body weight, waist circumference, and bo dy 
composi tion) at each time point a cross int ervention groups  will be examined. Subjects who h ave 
values outs ide +/-1.5*IQR will  be discuss ed and decisions about how to h andle th ese data will be 
agreed upon  and do cumented in w riting.

13.0. DEVIATI ONS FROM STATISTICAL PLAN AND OTHER ISSUES  
 
During the analysis and reporting  process, any deviations from the st atistical plan designed for 
this proto col wi ll be d escribed and just ified in the clinical study report. 
 
14.0. CHA NGES FROM THE  PROTOCOL  
 
1. An alysis populations  
 
An intent -to-treat (ITT) population wi ll include all particip ants who w ere random ized 
into the stu dy. A complete case popu lation (i. e., completers) will include the  subset of 
particip ants that comple ted the stu dy on the ir assigned intervention.  A m odified ITT 
population wi ll include all random ized particip ants that had a  least one pos t-baseline 
weight measurement. 
 
Changed to 
 
An Intent -To-Treat (ITT) popula tion will include all subje cts who were  randomized into 
the study.  A modified ITT popula tion will include all randomiz ed participants that  had at 
least one  post-baseline w eight measure ment. In addition, a Compl eters popula tion will 
comprise subje cts who were  randomized into the study and compl eted all the clinic visits 
of the whole 16 w eeks of the study.  
 
2. Primary outco me variables 
 
The prim ary endpoint  is change (percent change and absolute change) from baseline 
(Visit 2; week 0) body weight to Visit 7 ( week 16). Body weight change (percent and 
absolute change) at Vis its 3, 4, 5, and 6 (weeks 2,  4, 8, and 12) will also be  evaluated. 
 
Changed to 
 
The primary out come variable will be change  (absolute and p ercent chan ge) in body 
weight from baseline (Visit 2; week 0) to end of s tudy (Visit 7; we ek 16) 
 
3. Secondary outcome  variables 
 
Added 
 
Change  (absolute and percent chang e) in body  weight from baseline  (Visit 2; we ek 0) to 
Visits 3, 4, 5, and 6 (weeks 2, 4, 8, and 1 2) 
 
Participation at  assigned coaching s essions as a m easure of adh erence for the TSFL  
group.  
 
Utilization of  Nutrition Support  for the TSFL and MEDD  group.  
 
4. Miss ing or Incomplete Data 
 
Analysis with and without imputation will  be conducted in the  ITT popul ation.  For the 
analysis with imputation, sin gle [e.g., last obse rvation c arried forward (LOCF)], and/or

multiple impu tation w ill be consid ered, as appropriate (Elob eid, 2009;  Peng 201 5; 
George 2016). 
 
Changed to 
 
For the ITT popula tion, a mult iple imputat ion m ethod will be impl emented if the missing 
data m echanism is at least missing at  random (MAR). Meanwhi le, for the modif ied ITT 
popula tion, analys es with and wi thout imputa tion will be condu cted. For this imputat ion, 
the m ethod of  Last Obser vation Carr ied Forward  (LOCF) will be us ed as a  single 
imputa tion approa ch (Elobeid MA et al, 200 9). In this approach, if a subje ct’s 
measure ment is mis sing at a pos t-randomiza tion visit, the value from the  most proximal 
prior  visit will be us ed for all  missing visits afterwards.  The imputa tion m ethods wi ll 
only be  applied to body  weights. No imputa tions will be p erformed for other variables.  
 
 
 
5. Outl iers 
 
Individual values for the key outcome p arameters (body weight and waist circumference) 
at each time point a cross intervention groups  will be examined. Subjects who h ave values 
outside +/-1.5*IQR will be dis cussed and decisions about how to handle  these  data will 
be agreed upon and document ed in w riting. 
 
Changed to 
 
Individual  values for the key outcome para meters (body weight, waist  circumference, and 
body  compositio n) at ea ch time point  across intervention groups will be examin ed. 
Subje cts who ha ve values outside +/-1.5*IQR wi ll be dis cussed and d ecisions about how 
to hand le these  data will be agreed upon and d ocumented in wri ting.

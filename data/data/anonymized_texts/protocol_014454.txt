 1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The purpose of this clinical study is to evalua te the safety and efficacy of PEGylated  rADA 
(EZN -2279)  in patients with ADA -deficient combined immunodeficiency . The goal of this 
study is replacing PEGylated native bovine ADA (Adagen®) with EZN -2279. The EZN -
 2279 drug product is manufactured using deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) recombinant 
technology, with a more stable linker, which may potentially reduce immunogenicity and which will replace bovine protein with recombinant protein in patients with ADA- deficient 
severe combined immunodeficiency  (ADA -SCID ). 
 
This Statis tical Analysis Plan (SAP) is intended to provide a detailed description of the 
statistical analyses that will be performed for Study STP-2279- 002. Analyses described in 
this SAP are based on protocol  Version 3.0, dated 23- Aug-2017.

 2. STUDY OBJ ECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether therapy with EZN - 2279 achieves 
metabolic detoxification, as demonstrated by total erythrocyte deoxyadenosine nucleotide 
(dAXP ) concentration from a trough blood sample. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of EZN -2279  
• Assess the immunogenicity to EZN -2279 and Adagen®, including binding 
antibodies,  neutralizing antibodies and anti -PEG antibodies  
• Evaluate whether therapy with EZN -2279 maintains the trough pla sma ADA 
activity ≥ 15 μmol/h/mL  
• Determine the PK profile of EZN -2279  
• Assess the effect of EZN -2279 on immune status as determined by  absolute 
lymphocyte count  (ALC ), lymphocyte subset (B, T, and NK) analysis, and 
immunoglobulin (Ig) concentration (IgA, IgG, IgM)  
• Compare the clinical status (infections and hospitalizations) of the patients during 
the E ZN- 2279 treatment period compared to the prior six months  
• Assess the clinical growth status of the patients during the EZN -2279 treatment and 
maintenance per iods 
2.3 Associated Endpoints  
The endpoints that address the primary and secondary objectives are described in Section 6 (Efficacy) and Section 7 (Safety).

 3. STUDY DESIGN   
3.1 General Design and Study Procedures  
 
Protocol STP -2279- 002 is designed as an open- label , multicenter, single -arm, one way 
crossover study of EZN 2279 to determine the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic ( PK) 
of EZN -2279 in patients with ADA -SCID who are currently being treated with Adagen®.  
Each patient will serve as his or her own control with respect to assessment of study 
endpoints.  The study will enroll enough patients to allow for up to six  evalu able patients 
with ADA- deficient combined immunodeficiency and stable clinical status while currently 
receiving therapy with Adagen® who mee t all eligibility criteria and written informed 
consent/assent is obtained.    Patient participation in the study will be defined by the four distinct study periods defined below:  
• Screening (up to 28- days prior to start of Adagen
® Lead - in dosing) – This p eriod 
starts at the time of the initial screening procedure through administration of the first 
dose of Adagen® in the Lead- in period. Note: patients will continue to receive 
his/her prescribed dose of Adagen® during this period. 
• Adagen® Lead -in – This pe riod starts with the initial dose of study -required 
Adagen® dosing through the start of EZN -2279 study treatment.  This period will be 
a minimum of 3 weeks.  
• EZN -2279 Study Treatment – This period starts with the initial dose of EZN -2279 
through completion of at least 21 weeks of EZN -2279 dosing.  
• EZN -2279 Maintenance – This period begins after completion of the EZN -2279 
study period and continues until the end of the study (commercial availability of 
EZN -2279 or early study termination) . 
 The initial three patients will be enrolled and complete through full EZN -2279 
pharmacokinetic sampling (Week T -9).  An independent data and safety monitoring 
committee (DSMC) will review safety, PK (ADA activity), and erythrocyte dAXP data.  If no concerns are noted, enrol lment will continue for the remaining three patients.  A similar 
DSMC review will occur for EZN -2279 dosing  for the following:  
• All six patients who complete through (Week T -9). 
• All six patients who complete through (Week T -21).  
• All six patients who comple te one year ( i.e. two maintenance cycles) . 
 Throughout the duration of the study (i.e., Adagen
® Lead-in, EZN -2279 treatment and 
EZN -2279 maintenance) patients will continually be assessed for adverse events, infectious 
complications, hospitalizations, conc omitant medications changes and concomitant 
procedures.

 3.2 Sample Size and Power Considerations  
 
The study will enroll a sufficient number of patients with ADA -SCID  who meet all study 
entry criteria described to assure six (6) patients are evaluable, where evaluable is defined 
as completing the EZN -2279 treatment period (Week T -21) and providing pri mary study 
endpoint data .  
More than 6 patients may be enrolled to achieve the required number of evaluable 
patients.  It is expected that up to 12 study centers will participate in the study.  There are 
no restrictions on the number of patients a single s tudy center may enroll.  
The sample size of six patients accounts for more than 5% of the entire eligible patient 
population worldwide and 10% of the entire eligible patient population in the United 
States.  
The patients enrolled in this study all will have  achieved metabolic detoxification with  
weekly  Adagen® dosing prior to initiating EZN -2279 treatment. All p atients are expected 
to maintain the target trough total erythrocyte dAXP concentration with EZN -2279. 
Therefore, the usual statistical sample size calculations using precision analysis, power 
analysis, or probability are  not applicable due to zero variability.  
3.3 Randomization  
This is an open- label, single -arm study with no randomization.  
3.4 Changes to the Design and Study Procedures Proposed in Protocol  
None.

 4. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS            
The analysis populations used  to assess the results of th is study are described.  
4.1 As-Treated (AT ) Population  
The as -treated population, defined as all patients who are enrolled and receive at least one 
dose of either  EZN -2279 or  Adagen® Lead-in dosing , will be the primary analysis set in 
evaluating patient characteristics, treatment administration/compliance and safety.   
If, during the Adagen® Lead in phase, a patient cannot have his/her Adagen® dose 
adjusted such that inclusion criteria for trough dAXP levels (≤0.02 μmol/mL) and trough 
ADA activ ity (≥15 μmol/h/mL) levels are met , then this patient will not be eligible to  
move into the EZN -2279 treatment period (i.e., this patient will have no EZN -2279 
treatment and dosing  data) .  
4.2 PK Population  
The PK evaluable population, defined as all patients who have received EZN -2279 for at 
least 9 weeks (i.e. through at least Week T -9) and who have PK data at study week T -9 to 
indicate exposure, will be the analysis set for evaluatin g PK parameters.  
Patient datasets with samples collected until at least 120hr following dosing of EZN -2279 
in Week T -9 will be considered sufficient for PK analysis. Data will be considered 
insufficient for extrapolation of the terminal phase for determina tion of PK parameters if 
the following criteria are met: non -negative slope for the terminal phase; R2 <0.80 for the 
determination of λ z by log -linear regression; less than 3 data points after T max; 
extrapolated area- under -the-curve >80%.  
Patients < 10 years of age will not have full PK sampling done  due to the blood volume 
requirements and w ill only have limited s ampling done.  
4.3 Completer Population  
The completer population, defined as all patients who have received EZN -2279 through 
the primary endpoint visi t (i.e., through Week T -21) will be the analysis set for 
evaluating efficacy endpoints  because the complete EZN -2279 treatment period  is 
required to establish maintenance of the target trough levels, immune function status and 
other efficacy endpoints.

 6. EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
The completer population will be used for the primary efficacy analysis, because the 
endpoint cannot be evaluated until T -21, and the as -treated population will be used for a 
sensitivity analysis  of the primary efficacy endpoint . The as -treated population will be 
used for all other efficacy analyses , unless otherwise noted. Summaries will only be 
presented for the EZN -2279 group. Efficacy is e valuated in comparison to the Adagen® 
Lead in period (‘baseline’) . All efficacy data will be listed.  
Given the sample size, all efficacy analyses will be descriptive (i.e., no statistical testing and no reported p- values) , although 95% confidence intervals  (CI) may be presented to 
show the variability of estimates . 
6.1 Changes  to the P lanned Efficacy A nalysis P roposed in  Protocol  
The protocol called for interim analyses when three patients will be enrolled and complete through full EZN -2279 pharmacokinetic sampling (Week T -9) and again when 
six patients complete through 9- weeks of EZN -2279 dosing. There will be a third look 
that will be used for a Biologics License Application (BLA). In addition, there will be a 
final analysis  (fourth look)  to be completed  on al l patients on EZN -2279 after one year 
(i.e. two maintenance cycles) . 
6.2 Primary Endpoint  and Analysis               
The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving metabolic detoxification, 
assessed from trough dAXP samples obtained at Weeks T -15, T-17, T -19, and T -21.  
Metabolic detoxification is  defined as a trough dAXP concentration equal to or below 
0.02 μmol/mL.   
Trough dAXP level will be summarized at each above time point. Maintenance of 
detoxification is defined as meeting the target trough levels  for each of the 4 weeks listed 
above  in th e EZN -2279 treatment period. The proportion of patients meeting this 
definition of maintenance will be summarized.  
Trough dAXP level will be summarized at last observed value as a sensitivity analysis  
using the as -treated population.  
6.3 Secondary Endpoints a nd Analysis  
Data regarding blood sample collections for trough samples, lymphocyte subset, and 
quantitative immunoglobulins will be listed but not summarized.

 6.3.1 Trough Plasma ADA Activity  
Trough plasma ADA Activity will be assessed from trough plasma ADA s amples 
obtained at Weeks T -15, T -17, T 19, and T -21.  Adequate trough ADA activity will be 
defined as ADA activity ≥ 30 15 μmol/h/mL.  Trough ADA activity level will be 
summarized at each above time point.  Maintenance of adequate trough levels is defined 
as meeting the target trough levels for each of the 4 weeks listed above in the EZN -2279 
treatment period.  The proportion of patients meeting this definition of maintenance will 
be summarized.  
6.3.2 Maintenance Phase Trough Plasma dAXP and ADA Activity 
Maintenance phase troug h plasma dAXP and ADA activity will be assessed from trough 
plasma dAXP and ADA samples obtained during the maintenance phase of the study (every 3 months following T -21) through completion of EZN -2279 maintenance 
treatment  period. Trough dAXP and ADA levels will be summarized at each time point 
during the maintenance period.  Maintenance of adequate trough dAXP and ADA levels is defined as meeting the target trough levels for both dAXP and ADA at each visit during the maintenance period. The pr oportion of patients meeting this definition of 
maintenance will be summarized.   
6.3.3 Immune Status  
Immune Status will be assessed through completion of the EZN -2279 maintenance 
period, through assessment of:  
• Absolute lymphocyte count  
• B-, T-, and NK -lymphocyte subset analysis: The number of cells for each subset 
will be determined by FACS using the following panel:  
o Percent and Absolute CD3+   (Mature T cells)     
o Percent and Absolute CD3+ CD8+   (Suppressor T Cells)  
o Percent and Absolute CD3+ CD4+   (Helper Cells ) 
o Percent and Absolute CD (16+56)+    (Natural Killer Cells)  
o Percent and Absolute CD19+  (B Cells)  
o Absolute Lymphocytes (CD45+)  
o %CD4 (Helper Cells) / %CD8 (Suppressor T Cells) 
• Quantitative immunoglobulin concentration (IgG, IgA, IgM)

 Summary statistics for  immune status variables will be presented at baseline, each 
intermediate collection time -point, and endpoint.  Immune status values and changes 
from baseline to each visit and endpoint will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
The frequency of cli nically significant abnormal values will be summarized for selected 
immune status variables using descriptive statistics.  
6.3.4 Clinical Status  
Clinical status will be assessed through the conclusion of the EZN -2279 maintenance 
treatment period , through assessme nt of:  
• Infections determined and defined as either:  
o Clinically documented – patients with documented signs and symptoms of 
infection without positive microbiologic cultures  
o Microbiologically documented -  patients with documented signs and 
symptoms of infec tion and with positive viral or bacterial cultures  
• Hospitalizations  - incidence and duration of hospitalizations  
• Change in growth – height, weight and growth curve determinations  while 
patients are 18 years of age  and younger  
• Overall survival – through the  EZN -2279 maintenance  phase  
The total number of infections  and the incidence and duration of hospitalizations during 
the EZN -2279 treatment period will be summarized . Summary statistics for height, 
weight and BMI percentiles will be presented at baseline, each intermediate collection time-point, and endpoint .  Percentiles will be calculated programmatically based on 
reported age, gender, height and weight.

percentile scores to each visit ( at which  height and w eight are assessed) and endpoint will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
The proportion of patients surviving through the EZN -2279 maintenance phase will be 
summarized.  
6.4 Interim Analyses  
As noted in Section 3.1, the initial three patients will be enrolled and complete through full EZN -2279 pharmacokinetic sampling (Week T -9).  An independent data and safety 
monitoring committee (DSMC) will review safety, PK (ADA activity), and erythrocyte dAXP data.

 If no concerns are noted, enrollment will conti nue for the remaining three patients.  A 
similar DSMC review will occur after all six patients complete through 9 -weeks of EZN -
2279 dosing.   
Interim data  will be used for a BLA  when three  subjects have complete data through 
week T -21.  The BLA will include all patients enrolled at that time .  Details of this 
analysis will be described in the BLA Statistical Analysis Plan .

 7. SAFETY ANALYSIS    
 
The as -treated  population will be used for all of the safety analyses.  Summaries will be 
presented by study dr ug gro up (EZN -2279 or Adagen®), if appropriate , through 
completion of the EZN -2279 maintenance period. All safety data will be listed.  
7.1 Changes to the Planned Safety Analysis Proposed in Protocol  
The protocol called for interim analyses when three patients will b e enrolled and 
complete through full EZN -2279 pharmacokinetic sampling (Week T -9) and again when 
six patients complete through 9- weeks of EZN -2279 dosing.  There will be a third look 
that will be used for a BLA. In addition, there will be a final analysis (fourth analysis) on 
subjects who comple te one year (two maintenance cycles).  
7.2 Study Drug Administration 
Study d rug administration for both Adagen® and EZN -2279 will be summarized. 
Duration of treatment (days treated) is the number of days on each treatment based on the 
first and last day s of treatment with each study drug (last day of study drug  – first day of 
study drug + 1).  The number and percent of patients  and the number of doses  within 
categories for w eeks on treatment will be summarized for Adagen®. The percent of 
patients and the number of doses within categories for months  of treatment for EZN -2279 
during the EZN -2279 treatment period, and months of treatment combining the  EZN -
2279 treatment and maintenance periods will be summarized with categor ies. Duration of 
treatment (days) will also be summarized as a continuous variable for Adagen®, EZN -
2279 treatment, and overall EZN -2279 (treatment plus maintenance) using  descriptive 
statistics.   
Administration  of both Adagen® and EZN -2279 will be listed.  
7.3 Adverse Events  and Other Complications  
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA ) Version 16.0  or the most recent version prior to database lock . Summaries 
will be presented for all treatment -emergent adverse events (overall and by severity) , 
adverse events determined by the investigator to be treatment -related  (overall and by 
severity) , serious adverse events  (SAEs), adverse events causing discontinuation from 
study , adverse events causing discontinuatio n from study drug, and non -serious adverse 
events . In addition to being summarized as adverse events, i nfectious complications and 
hospitalizations are considered efficacy measures as are summarized in Section 6.3. 
The frequency  of adverse events will be s ummarized using descriptive statistics by 
system organ class (SOC), preferred term  and study drug group.  Patient s are counted 
only once in each SOC  category, and only once in  each preferred term category.

 Treatment -related adverse event summaries will in clude adverse events with missing 
relationship to study drug.  For the summaries by severity, patient s are counted at the 
greatest severity .  Adverse events missing the flag indicating serious will be excluded 
from the summary of serious adverse events  but included in the summary of non- serious  
adverse events . 
There will be two treatment emergent adverse event  summaries provided: all treatment 
emergent adverse events  while the patient takes Adagen® study drug and all treatment 
emergent adverse events  while the patient takes EZN -2279, where treatment emergent are 
new or worsening adverse events that occur while  on the respective therapies.  
Listings for all adverse events, deaths, serious adverse events , adverse events leading to 
discontinuation, Med DRA dictio nary terms for adverse event descriptions, and adverse 
event preferred terms by patient  number  will be presented.  
7.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Summary statistics for chemistry, hematology , and urinalysis  laboratory tests will be 
presented at baseline, each in termediate collection time -point, and endpoint.  Laboratory 
tests results  and changes from screening (for Adagen® drug group) or from the end of the 
Adagen® Lead-in period (for EZN -2279 drug group) to each visit and endpoint will be 
summarized using descri ptive statistics.  
Listings for laboratory data will be presented  identifying clinically significant abnormal 
results . Results of pregnancy tests will be listed , but not summarized.  
7.5 Vital Signs  
Summary statistics for vital signs will be presented at baselin e.  Abnormal vital sign  
values will be reported and summarized as adverse events.  
Actual v ital sign values will be listed , but not summarized.  
7.6 Physical Examination  
Physical examination data will be listed, but not summarized.     
7.7 Performance Status  
Performance status data (Karnofsky and Lansky) will be listed, but not summarized.  
Patients that are < 16 years when first assessed then are 16 or older at subsequent visits will have their s cores reported appropriate to the age at the time of the assessment 
(Lansky for < 16 years, Karnofsky ≥16 years ).

All concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO Drug , Version 2013Q1  or 
most recent version prior to database lock.  The frequency  of concomitant medications 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics by therapeutic class and preferred term.   
Patient s are counted only once in each therapeutic class category, and only once in each 
preferred term category.    
There will be two c oncomitant me dication summaries  provided:  all medications taken 
while the patient  takes Adagen® study drug a nd all medications taken while the patient 
takes EZN -2279.  
7.9 Immunogenicity  
The percentage of patients positive for each type of antibody will be summarized at

 10. RULES AND DEFINITIONS  
10.1 Timing of Analyses  
The initial three patients will be enrolled and complete through full EZN -2279 
pharmacokinetic sampling (Week T -9).  An independent data and safety monitoring 
committee (DSMC) will review safety, PK (ADA activity), and erythrocyte dAXP data.  
If no concerns are noted, enrollment will continue for the remaining three patients.  A 
similar DSMC review will occur for EZN -2279 dosing  for the following:  
 
• All six patients who complete through (Week T -9). 
• All six patients who complete through (Week T -21).  
• All six patients who complete one year (i.e. two maintenance cycles).  
 
Listings will be produced for the BLA  when three subjects have complete data through 
final analysi s (one year/two maintenance cycles).   The BLA will include all patients 
enrolled at that time.  
10.2 Association with Study Drug  
Assessments collected at EZN -2279 Day 1 (Week T -1) are associated with Adagen® 
treatment because EZN -2279 is not administered until a ll procedures are complete. All 
endpoints are measured in comparison to screening or the Adagen® Lead - in phase 
(baseline), as appropriate, within each patient.  
10.3 Assignment of Study Days  
For the purposes of data listings and summaries, “Study Day” will be calculated relative to the first dose of study medication (i.e., date of interest – date of first dose of Adagen
®). 
One day will be added if this difference is ≥ 0, so that the first dose of study medication is considered “Study Day - 1.” The day prior to the first dose of study medication is 
considered “Study Day - 1”. For analysis purposes, there will be no “Study Da y- 0”.  
10.4 Screening, Baseline and Study Weeks  
No windowing schemes will be applied to the data. For by -visit summaries, if there are 
multiple assessments at a post baseline visit then the last non -missing assessment at that 
visit will be used for the summary .  This includes assessments at the scheduled and 
unscheduled visits.  For Patient s who withdraw from the study, data at the early 
termination visit will be excluded from the by -visit summaries but will be included in the 
endpoint summaries. 
Screening is d efined as the last measurement for a variable before the initial dose of 
Adagen
® study drug. With the exception of adverse events and medications, a ssessments 
collected at the screening visit are associated with the screening period because Adagen® 
Leadiant Biosciences, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
Statistical Analysis Plan   
STP- 2279- 002 
Final / Version 2.0 
04 April  2019  
 
Page 29 of 37  
 is not administered until all procedures are complete.  Adverse events and medications 
starting on the day of the first dose of Adagen® are associated with Adagen® treatment.  
Baseline is defined as the last measurement for a variable before the initial dose of EZN -2279 
study drug , and is only used as the starting point for efficacy endpoints . With the exception 
of adverse events and concomitant medications, a ssessments collected at EZN -2279 Day - 
1 (Week T -1) are associated with Adagen® treatment because EZN -2279 is  not 
administered until all procedures are complete.  Adverse events and concomitant 
medications starting on the day of the first dose of EZN -2279 are associated with EZN -
2279 treatment.  
With regard to screening and baseline determination, assessments falli ng exactly on the 
date of the first dose of each study medication will be considered pre -dosing for that 
medication with the exception of adverse events and concomitant medications, which will 
be associated with the respective study drug.  
Missing data will not be imputed. 
10.5 Efficacy Data Handling  
Change from baseline to Week X in efficacy endpoints will be calculated from the end of the Adagen
® Lead-in period as:  
• (Endpoint Value at Week X)  – (Endpoint Value at Baseline) , where baseline is 
defined as in Sect ion 11.4. 
10.6 Safety  Data Handling  
For the purposes of AE reporting, three time periods will be defined based upon the onset date of the AE:  
• “Pre- treatment AEs” are AEs with onset dates < date of the first dose of Adagen
® 
study medication.  
• “Treatment -emergent AEs” are AEs with onset dates ≥ date of the first dose of 
study medication and within 30 days following the date of the last dose of study medication.  
• “Post -treatment AEs” are AEs with onset dates > 30 days after the date of the last 
dose of study medi cation , within study STP -2279- 002.  
“Pre- treatment” and “Post -treatment” AEs are considered non -treatment - emergent AEs. 
For AEs with partially missing onset dates, an onset date is imputed as detailed in Section 
12 (Programming Specifications). If an AE has a completely missing onset date, it is

Statistical Analysis Plan   
STP- 2279- 002 
Final / Version 2.0 
04 April  2019  
 
Page 30 of 37  
 counted as a “treatment -emergent” event, unless the stop date is on or before the date of 
the first dose of study medication.  
If relationship to study drug is missing, for analysis purposes it will be assumed to be 
related to study drug. For AEs which occur more than once within a time period (see above), the AE which is most related to study drug in that time period will be used in the summary of AEs by categories of relationship to study drug. Similarly, the AE w ith the 
maximum intensity in that time period will be used in the summary of AEs by categories of severity.  
For each study drug (EZN -2279 or Adagen
®) medications will be assigned to a time 
period as follows:  
• Medications taken any time < date of the first  dose of Adagen® during the Lead-in 
phase will be considered prior medications.  
• Medications can be concomitant with either Adagen®, EZN -2279, or both. 
Medications taken any time ≥ date of the first dose of respective study medication 
and within 30 days following the date of the last dose of respective study 
medication will be considered concomitant medications  for that study drug.  
• Medications taken > 30 days after the date of the last dose of respective study medication will be considered “post treatment”  medications  for that study drug .  
Note that medications can be counted in more than one category (i.e., prior/concomitant)  
and can have different assignments for different study drugs . Imputation rules for 
partially missing start/stop dates are described in Section 12 (Programming 
Specifications).  
Change from baseline to Week X in safety endpoints will be calculated as:  
• Adagen
® Drug Group: (Endpoint Value at Week X) – (Endpoint Value at 
Screening ), where screening  is defined as in Section 11.4.  
• EZN -2279 Drug Group: (Endpoint Value at Week X) – (Endpoint Value at End of 
Adagen® Lead-in phase ).

 11. PROGRAMMING SPECIFIC ATIONS  
• All output should have the following header at the upper left margin:  
 
Leadiant Biosciences, Inc.   
Study  STP -2279- 002  
 
And t he followi ng header (right -justified) at the upper right margin:  
 Page X  of Y   
Report Date: DDMMMYYYY  
 
• Tables and listings should be internally paginated (i.e., page numbers should appear sequentially within each table). All output should have the SAS program name as xxxx.sas in the lower right, and the data source(s)  as ADxx  used to 
generate the output in the lower left.  
 
• In general, da ta listings should be sorted by  Patient  ID, study drug, and 
visit/assessment/collection/start dates, unless specific instructions  to do otherwise.  
 
• The following algorithm should be used to estimate adverse event start dates for 
which onl y partial information is known. To conservatively assign start dates as 
early is possible first day on study drug is first day of Adagen® study me dication. 
 
o Missing day and month  
 
 If the year is the same as the year of first day on drug, then the day and  
month of the start date of drug will be assigned to the missing fields.  
 If the year is prior to the year of first day on drug, then December 31 w ill 
be assigned to the missing fields.  
 If the year is after the year of first day on drug, then January 01 will be assigned to the missing fields.  
 
o Missing month only  
  Treat day as missing and replace both month and day according to the above procedure.  
 
o Missing day only  
 
 If the month and year are the same as the year and month of first day on drug, then the start date of drug will be assigned to the missing day.

  If the month and year are before the year and month of first day on drug, 
then the last day  of the month will be assigned to the missing day.  
 If the month and year are after the year and month of first day on drug, then the first day of the month will be assigned to the missing day.  
 If the resultant imputed start date is after the AE stop date (and the AE stop date is complete), the imputed start date will be reset to the AE stop date.  
 
• Adverse events with partially missing stop dates and the “continuing” variable 
indicated as ‘no’ will have stop dates imputed as follows:  
 
o year is missing   – date left missing.  
 
o month is missing – impute ‘December’.  
 
o day is missing – impute ‘last date of that month’.  
 
• Complete dates for concomitant medications with missing or partially missing start dates will be imputed, if necessary, using the same algorith m described for adverse 
event onset dates. If the stop date is missing or partially missing and the “ongoing” variable is indicated as ‘no’, the imputation rule is applied in the following order :  
 
o year is missing  - the medication will be considered to have been received at all 
periods after that period determined by the start date. Date is left missing.  
 
o month is missing -  impute ‘December’.  
 
o day is missing -  impute ‘last date of that month’.  
 
• The following algorithm should be used, when necessary, to ca lculate a start date that 
is partially missing for medical history:  
 
o missing day and month -  January 01 will be assigned to the missing fields.  
 
o missing month only -  treat day as missing and replace both month and day 
according to the above procedure.  
o missing day only -  assign first of the month to the missing day.  
• Partially missing stop dates will be imputed as:   
o year is missing , no imputation. Date left missing.

 o month is missing and year is prior to year of first dose of study medication - 
impute 'D ecember'.  
 
o month is missing and year the same as the year of the first dose of study 
medication – impute same month as in start date.  
 
o  day is missin g: impute 'last date of that month'. If this results in a date ≥ the 
date of the first dose of study medication, impute day as the day prior to the first dose of study medication.  
 
• Date imputations will be applied to the process of assigning study day and s hould be 
retained in the analysis datasets, but the data listings should display the original, 
partially missing dates.  
 
• Unless otherwise noted (see below), the mean and median (standard deviation and 
standard error) of a set of values should be printed out to one (two) more decimal place(s) than the raw value.  
 
e.g.,  if raw:        xx  
mean and median :      xx.x  
standard deviation and standard error:  xx.xx  
range (minimum and maximum):    xx, xx  
 In those cases where the raw data are reported to 2 or 3  decimal places, the mean, 
median, standard deviation, and standard error will all be displayed to 1 more decimal 
place than the raw data (e.g., tables summarizing changes from baseline in laboratory parameters).  
 
• All table percentages should be reported to the precision of tenths (i.e., 0.1) unless 
otherwise noted.  
 
• The following specifications apply to tables that summarize categorical data unless otherwise noted:  
 
o Percent of events should be left blank (including the parentheses) if the number of event s is zero.  
 
o If the categories of a parameter are ordered, then all categories between the maximum possible category and the minimum category should be included, even if n=0 for a given category between the minimum and maximum level for that parameter.

 o If the categories are not ordered, then only those categor ies for which there is 
at least one Patient  represented should be included.  
 
o A ‘Missing’ category should be added to any parameter for which information 
is not available for any patient s.  
 
• Missing data should be represented on listings as 1) dashes “ -”, and properly 
footnoted: “ -  = data not available” or 2) “N/A”, with footnote “N/A” = Not 
Applicable”, whichever is appropriate.  
 
• Times should be printed in the format “HH:MM”. “HH” represents the 2- digit 
hour portion of the time. “MM” represents the 2 -digit minute portion of the time. 
Both hour and minute portions of time are zero- filled on the left if they have only 
one digit. Missing time portions should be represented on patient  listings as 
dashes  (“10: --” and “--: --”). Times that are missing because they are not 
applicable for the patient  should be printed as “N/A” unless otherwise specified.  
 
• Adverse event summary tables will only include treatment- emergent AEs. 
However, listings will include all AEs (i.e., treatment -emergent and non 
treatment -emergent AEs) with the non treatment- emergent AEs flagged.

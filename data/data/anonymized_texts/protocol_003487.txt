General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses 
The primary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical fixed sequence in the following 
order.  
 
The statistical hypotheses for the primary endpoint of CFB  corneal fluorescein 
staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 57 are as follows:  
 H 01: The difference, between study eyes treated with NOV03 and study 
eyes treated with saline, in the mean CFB  corneal fluorescein staining 
(NEI scale) total score at Day 57 = 0.  
 H A1:  The difference, between study eyes treated with NOV03 and study 
eyes treated with saline, in the mean CFB  corneal fluorescein staining 
(NEI scale) total score at Day 57 ≠ 0, with superiority claimed if the 
difference is less than 0 (NOV03 minus saline).  
The statistical hypotheses for the hierarchical primary endpoint of the CFB Dryness 
Score (VAS) at Day 57 are as follows: 
 H
02: The difference, between subjects treated with NOV03 and subjects 
treated with saline, in the mean CFB  Dryness Score (VAS) at Day 57= 
0. 
 H A2: The difference, between subjects treated with NOV03 and subjects 
treated with saline, in the mean CFB  Dryness Score (VAS) at Day 57 ≠ 
0, with superiority claimed if the difference is less than 0 (NOV03 
minus saline) . 
The stu dy has been designed to have 95% power to reject both H 01 and H 02 assuming 
independence between the sign and symptom endpoint; positive correlation between these two endpoints would increase the overall power.  
Estimated mean differences (common standard deviations) in CFB  to Day  57 using an 
ANCOVA analysis with CFB  to Day 57 as the response, baseline as a covariate and 
treatment as the fixed effect from NVU -002 are: - 1.2 (2.5) for  tCFS and - 11 (26) for 
Dryness Score. Conservative estimates of - 1.0 (2.8 ) for tCFS and -10 (28) for Dryness 
Score are used for sample size cal culation. 
 
Two hundred fifty (250) subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 97.9% power 
to reject H 01 in favor of H A1 and conclude superiority of NOV03 over saline in the mean 
CFB  tCFS score at Day 57 assuming a true difference (NOV03 minus saline)  of -1.0, a

Clinical Trial Protocol #  NVU- 003 27 AUG 2020 FINAL v4 .0 
 
Confidential  Page  10 of 78 common standard deviation of 2. 8, and a two -sided alpha = 0.05.  Two hundred fifty 
(250) subjects per treatment group yields 97.9% power to reject H 02 in favor of H A2 and 
conclude superiority of NOV03 over saline in the mean CFB  Dryness Score (V AS) at 
Day 57 assuming a true difference (NOV03 minus saline) of -10, a common standard 
deviation of 28, and a two- sided alpha = 0.05.  Accounting for an assumed 10% subject 
discontinuation rate, approximately 560 subjects (2 80 subject each arm) will be 
randomly assigned to trial treatment such that approximately 250 evaluable participants 
per arm complete the trial.  
 
Therefore, assuming independence between tCFS score and Dryness S core (VAS) , 250 
FAS subjects per treatment grou p at Day  57 yields 97.9% * 97.9% = 95.8% power to 
reject both H 01 and H 02. 
 Hierarchical fixed sequence testing will be employed to maintain the type I error rate. 
The primary analyses will first test the difference in the mean CFB  corneal fluorescein 
staining (NEI scale) total score between treatments at Day 57. If the test of th e 
difference is statistically significant at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level in favor of 
NOV03 then the trial will be considered a success; NOV03 will be declared to be superior to saline in the mean CFB  corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total scor e 
at Day 57; and the difference in the mean  CFB  total Dryness Score between treatments 
at Day 57 will be tested at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level. 
 If in addition to a statistically significant test of the difference in the mean CFB  corneal 
fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 57 is in favor of NOV03, and the test of the difference in the mean change from Dryness Score at Day 57 is also  statistically 
significant in favor of NOV03, then NOV03 will be declared to be superior to saline in 
both the mean CFB  corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score and the mean 
CFB  of the Dryness Score at Day 57.  
 If both primary endpoints demonst rate statistically significant superiority of NOV03 
versus saline at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level, a hierarchical testing of  the secondary 
endpoints will be performed.  
 
Primary Efficacy Analyses:   
The primary comparison in this trial will be between N OV03 versus saline at Day 57. 
The primary efficacy endpoints (e.g. CFB  in total corneal fluorescein staining [NEI 
scale] and Dryness Score [VAS]) will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, min,  and max) and analyzed separately u sing an ANCOVA model 
with terms for baseline value, and treatment.  
Least squares mean for each treatment group and for the difference between treatment 
groups will be presented from each model together with two- sided p- values (used for 
primary inference) and 95% confidence intervals. 
Two-sample t -tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests and mixed- effect repeated measures 
analysis comparing treatment groups will be performed as sensitivity analyses.

Confidential  Page  11 of 78 The primary analysis of the primary endpoints will use the Full Analy sis Set (FAS) 
with available data per subject , assuming the overall study discontinuation rate is <5% . 
If the overall study discontinuation rate is ≥5% then the primary analysis will be based 
on primary imputation methodology as detailed in the statistical analysis section and 
the available data analyses will become robustness analyses.  
Additional robustness analyses will include repeating the primary analysis on the per 
protocol set (PPS); the FAS imputing missing data using last observation car ried 
forward (LOCF); the FAS imputing missing data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) multiple imputation methodology under different assumptions of 
missingness (at random and not at random) each using 30 imputed values .  
 
Further  Efficacy A nalyses : 
The following secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically:  
1. CFB  of Dryness Score (VAS) at Day  15 
2. CFB  in total Corneal Fluorescein Staining (tCFS) (NEI scale) at Day  15  
3. CFB  of VAS burning/stinging at Day 57  
4. CFB  in central Corneal Fluorescein Staining (cCFS) (NEI scale) at Day  57 
 
Inference will only be made on these endpoints, at a 2- sided alpha = 0.05, if both 
primary endpoints and any higher order secondary endpoints are statistically significant at a 2 -sided alpha = 0.05 in favor of NOV03.  
 
The primary analysis of the secondary endpoints will use the Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
with available data per subject , assuming the overall study discontinuation rate is <5% . 
If the overall study discontinuation rate is ≥5%, then the primary analysis of the 
secondary endpoints will follow the same imputation strategy detailed for the primary endpoints . 
Quantitative secondary and other pre -specified efficacy endpoints will be summarized 
descriptively (n, mean, standard deviation, median, min and max) by visit, and analyzed 
similarly to the primary endpoint at each measured visit and CFB . Least squares mean 
for each treatment group and for  the difference between treatmen t groups will be 
presented from the model together with two- sided p- values and 95% confidence 
intervals.   
Two-sample t -tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests and mixed- effect repeated measures 
analysis will also be presented  as sensitivity analyses.  The other pre -specified  analyses 
will use the Full Analysis Set (FAS) with available data per subject.  
Other pre -specified  endpoints evaluating the proportion of study eyes (or subjects) 
meeting pre -defined criteria will be presented and tested between treatment groups 
using logistic regression analysis adjusting for baseline tCFS score at each measured follow -up visit. Pears on chi -squared analysis comparing the treatment groups will be 
performed  as sensitivity analyses.

Safety Variables : 
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Frequencies and 
percentages of subjects with treatment -emergent adverse ev ents (TEAEs), serious 
TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be provided by treatment 
group. An AE is treatment emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of trial 
treatment. Furthermore, frequencies will be given of subjects wi th TEAEs by system 
organ class; by system organ class and preferred term; by system organ class, preferred 
term and maximal severity; by system organ class, preferred term and strongest 
relationship; and by system organ class, preferred term, maximal sever ity, and strongest 
relationship. Separate summaries will be performed for ocular and non -ocular TEAEs.   
Other safety endpoints including assessments of visual acuity, slit -lamp biomicroscopy, 
dilated fundoscopy, and intraocular pressure will be summarized by treatment group and visit using descriptive statistics. Changes from baseline will also be summarized where appropriate. For assessments performed by eye, study eye and fellow eye will 
be summarized separately.

2.1 Dry Eye Disease (DED) 
Dry Eye Disease (DED) is defined by the International Dry Eye Workshop (DEWS) as a  
multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the 
tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnor malities 
play etiological roles  (Craig et al, 2017). Symptoms of DED such as feeling of dryness, 
burning, a sandy/gritty sensation, foreign body sensation, pain or itchiness are quite debilitating. In addition, visual  function related symptoms such as fluctuating vision with 
blinking, blurred vision, and difficulty with reading despite perfect visual acuity is an important and underestimated aspect of the disease. In consequence, DED negatively impacts quality of life comparably to other severe diseases ( Schiffman et al. 2003), and 
adverse effects on mental health, such as depression and anxiety, have been observed (Le 
et al. 2012 ). DED is a serious and chronic disorder that, if left untreated or undertreated, 
progressively damages the ocular surface and may lead to permanent vision loss due to 
corneal complications (Lemp et al., 1995).  
 As many as 5 - 35% of subjects visiting ophthalmic clinics report dry eye symptoms, 
making it one of the most common conditions seen by ophthalmic specialists ( McCarty et 
al. 1998; Lin et al. 2003). Estimates of the prevalenc e of dry eye vary considerably, 
depending on the criteria used to define the disease, but i n the United States ( US), it has 
been estimated that as many as 3.2 million women and 1.7 million men over the age of 50 have DED, with a projected 40% increase in the number of patients affected by 2030  
(Schaumberg et al, 2002; Schaumberg et al, 2003; Schaumberg et al, 2009) With the aging 
population in the US and other countries of the developed world, and with increasing 
computer use, DED is expected to continue to become more prevalent and finding a 
treatment is becoming more important ( Benitez -del-Castillo et al. 2017 ).  
2.2 Produc t Rationale 
NOV03 is a sterile ophthalmic eye drop formulation , developed for the treatment of the 
signs and symptoms of DED . 
 
It is a single component product consisting of 100% perfluorohexyloctane . NOV03 
addresses DED associated with MGD via a new physicochemical mode of action. D ue to 
its low surface tension  it rapidly spreads across  the ocular surface and  interacts with the 
lipophilic part of the tear film forming a layer at the tear film air interface. Such a layer 
prevents excessive evaporation of the aqueous tear film component.  
 
As a water -free, single component product, it is free 
of excipients like oils, surfactants and preservatives. Related advantages include convenient 
handling, improved tolerability, and a decrease in the visual disturbance upon insti llation s. 
Due to this mode of action subjects with DED associated with MGD were considered to 
experience the greatest benefit from the treatment. This is in line with experience from the

For the US development of NOV03, the phase 2 clinical trial NVU -002 (SEECASE -1) was 
conducted in US clinical sites. NVU- 002 was designed to specifically include a DED 
population with an  MGD component. In NVU -002, subject s improved clinically 
significantly from treatment with NOV03. The magnitude of symptom improvement was 
large (in the 50% range) for many of the VAS items in the NOV03 groups.

Confidential  Page  21 of 78 2.4 Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
The active and only ingredient  of NOV03, perfluorohexyloctane, is a semifluorinated 
alkane with a well -established tolerability and safety profile .  
 
  
  
 
It is not yet approved in the US.  
 
Safety data from  the NVU-002 trial showed an excellent clinical safety and tolerabil ity 
profile. No remarkable imbalance in terms of treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) 
across treatment groups  were revealed . Incidence of ocular AEs was low , ranging from 
4.5% to 11.7% , and the great majority were of mild intensity. Inst illation site reactions were 
reported in single cases in 3 (2.6%) subjects in NOV03 QID, 1 (0.9%) subject in NOV03 
BID and 2 (1.8%) subjects in the saline group. A total of 4 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 4 subjects. Three (3) subjects were randomized to the NOV03 QID group and 1 subject was randomized to the NOV03 BID group. All SAEs were non -ocular and 
not related to trial treatment.  All SAEs resolved. 
 Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated  fundoscopy, mean best corrected visual acuity (BC VA) 
and intraocular pressure ( IOP) observations did not indicate any treatment -related changes.  
There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, laboratory parameters or other observations related to safety.  Up to now four AEs of blurred vision have been reported, two were assessed as not related and two as related. If  any visual disturbances should occur upon instillation of the drop the 
subject  is advised not to drive or use machines until such effects have disappeared . 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 As described in Section 2.3 the NVU- 002 trial demonstrated a favorable efficacy  in 
reducing signs and symptoms of DED in subject s with evaporative forms of DED  
. This efficacy profile is supported by  experience from the Post Market Clinical 
Follow-up studies.  
In summary, based on the preclinical and clinical data obtained to date, risks to subj ects in 
the planned NVU-003 trial are considered very low. Furthermore, the subjects randomized in this trial will be closely monitored, and current standard ophthalmological safety assessments will be performed during the entire treatment period.

Clinical Trial Protocol # NVU- 003 27 AUG 2020 FINAL v4 .0 
 
Confidential  Page  22 of 78 The efficacy demonstrated to date shows that  NOV03  reduces  DED signs as well as DED 
symptoms stronger than the saline comparator  in the target population of subjects with DED 
  
NOV03 therefore provides a favorable benefit -risk treatment profile to subjects with DED 
. The NVU -003 trial is designed to confirm th e positive benefit- risk 
profile.

Clinical Trial Protocol #  NVU- 003 27 AUG 2020 FINAL v4 .0 
 
Confidential  Page  23 of 78 Each treatment group will be comprised of 280  subjects such that approximately 250 
evaluable subjects per arm complete the trial. Approximately 29 clinical sites are 
anticipated to participate.  
 
This trial will consist of two periods: Up to  14-day screening period and a 57 -day treatment 
period ( See Appendix 1).   
 
4.2 End of Trial Definition  
The end of the trial  for an individual subject  is defined as that subject ’s last clinic visit or 
the date of early termination, if applicable . For subjects that are lost to follow -up, the date 
of early termination will be the date of the last attended clinic visit. The end of the trial for the overall trial is defined as completion of the last visit or procedure as specified in schedule of assessments for all subjects in the trial.  
 
4.3 Visit Description  
Subjects will be required to sign an Informed Consent before completing any trial related procedure s. All trial procedures are listed in S ection 8.4 and in the s chedule of assessments  
Appendix 1. The ocular symptoms assessments and ev aluations must  be performed in the 
respective order  as listed . IMP  Dispensation is described in Section 7.1.4.  
 Subjects will be instructed not to show or discuss the properties of the assigned IMP and /or 
their experience with the IMP with other trial  participants, and not to show or discuss the 
IMP w ith the Investigator or site staff other than the dedicated dosing coordinator, unless 
instructed to do so.  Screening  (Visit 0)  
 All assessments required for the screening visit must be done within 14 days before  the 
randomization, baseline Visit 1. At least one eye must qualify with  all of the following 
objective measures: Tear film break up time ≤ 5 sec, Schirmer’s Test ≥5 mm, Meibomian 
gland dysfunction (MGD) defined as  MGD score  ≥ 3, and total Corneal Fluorescein 
Staining (CFS) of 4 ≤x≤11. Subjects who fail to qualify for the trial at screening may be 
rescreened  as described in Section 5.5. 
Baseline Day 1 (Visit 1)  
On Day 1 (Visit 1), eligible subjects will be evaluated for baseline signs and symptoms  of 
dry eye disease and will be randomized to NOV03 QID or saline solution QID . Subjects  
will be given a 14- day supply and will self-administer a single  drop of the first initial trial 
medication into each eye  at the clinic . Subsequently the subject will be asked to complete 
an instillation comfort questionnaire. Each subject will be given a dosing diary to record

the remaining doses should be taken.  
Visits 2 -4 / (ET)  
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 15±1 (Visit 2), 29±2 (Visit 3), and 57±2 (Visit 
4/Early Termination (ET) ) to be evaluated for signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. The 
subject will be asked to complete a n eyedrop acceptability questionnaire duri ng Visit 4 . 
Collection and review of IMP will be performed (u sed and  unused trial medication should 
be returned to the clinic ) and new trial medication will be dispensed at Visit 2 and Visit 3 . 
The dosing diary will be collected at the clinic during each v isit and checked for 
compliance. Subjects will be dis charged  from the trial  after all Visit 4 /ET assessments have 
been completed.  
Early Termination  
Subjects who terminate early during the treatment period will be asked to complete  all 
assessments as indicated at Visit 4 on the schedule of assessments prior to commencement 
of any alternative dry eye therapy (if considered  possible). Subjects who are terminated 
early from the trial  will not be replaced.  
Trial  Flow  
All subjects will be expected to p rogress from screening thr ough trial exit. All subjects will 
follow the trial structure as shown in Figure 1.

factor in this trial.  IRS will be used to account for the stratification factor s while assigning 
the drug kit number s at visits 1, 2 and 3. The subjects, investigators , Clinical Research 
Organization ( CRO ) personnel involved in conduct and monitoring of the trial  and sponsor 
will be masked to IMP assignment. 
Each subject will participate in the trial for approximately 10 weeks. The total duration of 
the trial from First Subje ct First Visit ( FSFV ) until Last Subject Last Visit ( LSLV ) is 
expected to be approximately 8 months.

The two primary endpoints , tCFS and Dryness Score , will be tested i n a hierarchical  order 
with total corneal fluorescein staining being tested first  as the NVU -002 data  for this 
endpoint is stronger. The hierarchical testing has  been selected to protect the α – error.

Confidential  Page  26 of 78 4.6 Justification of Dose  
The NOV03 QID dosing regimen to be evaluated i n this trial is based on the results  from 
the phase 2 NVU- 002 trial. The QID regimen showed more pronounced reductions in tCFS 
and symptom score s as measured by OSDI and VAS . This was confirmed by responder  
analyses on signs (tCFS) as well as symptoms (Dry ness Score) that underlined the relevance 
of these observed changes.  
 
Based on the  safety and tolerability profile seen for both treatment regime ns in NVU- 002 
and the consistent trend for better efficacy in NOV03 QID  in both signs and symptoms  the 
QID dose regime n will be tested in this trial.  The aim of the current trial NVU -003 is to 
replicate the efficacy and safety results of NVU -002.

Subjects are free to discontinue their participation in the trial at any time without giving 
their reasons.  
A subject must  be discontinued after randomization from the trial  for any of the 
following reasons:  
• Occurrence of pregnancy ; 
• Withdrawal of subject`s consent ; 
• Emergency unblinding has occurred.  
A subject must  be discontinued from t reatment  after randomization for any of the 
following reasons  (but may remain in the trial for follow up assessments) : 
• If at any time during the trial the investigator determines that a subject’s safety has 
been compromise d; 
• Occurrence of an exclusion criterion that  is clinically relevant and affects the 
subject’s s afety ;

Clinical Trial Protocol #  NVU- 003 27 AUG 2020 FINAL v4 .0 
 
Confidential  Page  33 of 78 In compliance with the  Code of Federal Regulations 21 part 312, section 312.6, the labels 
for the IMP shall be comprised of:  
 
• Protocol number  
• Kit Number  
• Investigational new drug statement  
• Storage conditions  
• Name and address of the sponsor  
 
7.1.3 IMP Storage  
The IMPs must be stored in a secure area accessible only to the investigator  or pharmacist  
and his/her designees. IMPs must be stored at room temperature under temperature-
monitored conditions and must not be refrigerated. Subjects should be instructed to store 
IMP at room temperature and out of children’ s reach  at home. Subjects should not use a 
dispensed bottle that has been opened for more than 30 days .  
 
7.1.4 IMP Dispensation  
• The dedicated dosing coordinator is responsible for dispensing the IMP  and 
supervision of first dose administration at Visit 1 . 
• The IMPs must only be distributed to subjects properly qualified under this protocol to 
receive IMP.  
• IMP will be provided to the clinical sites as subject kits containing 2 bottles of NOV03 or saline solution. 
• At the end of Visit 1, qualified subjects will be randomized and a kit of IMP containing 
2 bottles for each subject will be assigned using IR S. The first dose of IMP will be 
administered at the clinical site.  
• At Visits  1 and 2 t he subject will receive one  subject kit.  
• At V isit 3 t he subject will receive two subject kit s. 
• At Visits  2, 3 and 4 used/unused IMP will be collected from subjects for drug 
accountabili ty by the dedicated dosing coordinator .  
Subjects will be instructed to immediately contact the site if any damage to  the IMP, e.g. 
kit/bottle(s) is noticed . In case the subject needs a replacement bottle of IMP, the next bottle 
from the kit can be used by the subject . If no bottle remains in the kit, a new kit will be 
assigned to the subject using IR S.  
 
7.1.5 Instructions for Use and Administration  
At Visit 1 s ubjects will be instructed by the dedicated dosing coordinator  on appropriate 
hygiene and eye drop dosing technique. Subjects will self -administer NOV03 or s aline eye

Confidential  Page  34 of 78 drops in each lower cul -de-sac of each eye as shown in Appendix 2 under the supervision 
of th e dedicated dosing coordinator  on Day 1 (Visit  1).  Subsequent eye drops on Day 1 
are to be instilled by the subjects according to detailed written instructions . Subject s will be 
instructed to instill their drops into both  eyes QID  for the duration of the trial . Clinic staff 
will coach the subject s to dose themselves at approximately the same time every day e.g., 
morning, lunch time /mid-day, afternoon/early evening, and at bedtime . If a dose is missed, 
then the next dose should be a dministered on time.  The dedicated dosing coordinator will 
inform s ubjects  on how to store IMP (see Section 7.1.3) and dose IMP and how to complete 
their dosing diary . 
 
Dosing should be continued until the day of the next Visit ( should be at least 2 hours before 
first ophthalmic examination).  
 The bottles are designed for multiple use. Subjects will be instructed to only open one bottle at a time. They  should be instructed not to discard the empty bottles but keep them in the 
kit box and return them at their next visit in  the kit box. Subjects will record dosing in their 
dosing diary. Subjects will be instructed not to show the assigned IMP to the Investigator 
or site staff other than the dedicated dosing coordinator, unless instructed to do so.  
7.2 IMP Accountability  
The dedicated dosing coordinator at each site must keep an accurate accounting of IMPs 
received from the supplier by maintaining a detailed inventory. IMP shipment records will be verified and accountability performed by comparing the IMP shipment inventory sheet to the actual quantity of used/unused IMP bottles received at the site.  
 
Accurate records of receipt and disposition of the IMP (e.g. dates, quantity, subject number, 
kits used, kits unused, etc.) must be maintained by the dedicated dosing coordinator  at each 
site. This includes the amount di spensed to subjects, amount returned to the site by the 
subjects, and the amount returned to the sponsor or designee upon completion of the trial.  
 
Investigational trial medication orders, records of receipts, dispensing records, and 
inventory forms will be examined and reconciled by the dedicated dosing coordinator . At 
each visit, subjects will return all bottles to clinic staff for accountability purposes. Accountability will be ascertained by performing reconciliation between the amount of IMP cartons ( kits and their components) sent to the site, the amount used and unused at the time 
of reconciliation. All investigational trial medication that is dispensed during the course of the trial must be accounted for on a n IMP accountability form. No IMP kits or  bottles will 
be returned to the Sponsor  prior to full accountability by sponsor’s monitor. 
7.3 IMP Handling and Return  
Unless otherwise directed, at the end of the trial  all returned (used and unused)  IMP must 
be directly shipped from the clinical site to the Sponsor  for destruction of the medications.

Confidential  Page  35 of 78 Note: The medications should not be disposed or returned  prior to full accountability 
by the sponsor’s monitor. The clinical site will include  a copy of all  completed drug 
disposition forms with the IMP to the sponsor after full  accountability is completed . 
 
7.4 IMP Masking  
Investigational drug and control will be provided in identical bottles and labels to ensure 
the double -masked character of the trial.  The In vestigator/site staff and Bausch & Lomb, 
Incorporated personnel or designee(s) involved in the conduct of the trial will be masked to 
the IMP.   Clinical Trial Material Supply Chain are unmasked designee.  
 Due to physicochemical differences between NOV03 an d saline, there will be a dedicated 
dosing coordinator who will be responsible for the handling of IMP and activities  (such as 
dispensation, collection, accountability)  surrounding the use of IMP.  
 Each site must have a dedicated dosing coordinator that w ill be responsible for : 
• all IMP dispensation and accountability,  
• daily diary dosing education/review,  
• all discussions with study subjects related to IMP,  
• the administration of the Eyedrop Acceptability and Instillation Comfort 
Questionnaires.  
 This designee shall not participate in any other trial procedures  and not report this 
information to other staff . Subjects will be instructed to administer the IMP out of the sight 
of the Investigator or site staff other than the dedicated dosing coordinator. Subjects are not to show or discuss the properties of the assigned IMP to the Investigator or site staff other than the dedicated dosing coordinator, unless instructed to do so.  
7.5 Other Trial Supplies  
Diaries, Questionnaires, Urine Pregnancy Tests, Meibomian Gland Evaluator stick, Schirmer’s test strips, sodium fluorescein,  will be provided to sites . Respective i nstructions

8.1 Concurrent Medications and Therapies  
The use of any concurrent medication, prescription or over -the- counter, is to be recorded 
on the subject’s  source document  and corresponding e CRF along with the reason the 
medication was taken.  Concurrent or previous medications are to be recorded for 60 days 
prior to Visit 0. Any physical therapies , or surgeries are to be documented for 6 months 
prior to Visit 0.  
Therapy considered necessary for the subject’s welfare that will not interfere with the 
evaluation of the study medication may be given at the discretion of the Investigator  and in 
consultation with the medical monitor . If there is any question as to whether the medication 
may interfere, the investigator should contact the m edical monit or or sponsor. Whenever 
possible, medications should be administered in dosages that remain constant throughout the study duration. 
Physical t herapies  such as lid scrubs, lid wipes, warm compresses , systemic antibiotics  
(such as tetracyclines ) and oral supplements for treatment of ocular conditions  must  be 
stable within the last 30  days prior to Visit 1  and should be maintained stable throughout 
the trial. Changes in those therapies or initiation of such therapies  should be recorded on 
the subject’s source document and corresponding eCRF. 
8.2 Prohibited Medications 
Disallowed medications and treatments are listed in the exclusion c riteria (Section 5.4). All 
medications and treatments that were not allowed prior to  trial are al so not allowed during 
the trial in particular wearing of contact lenses, ocular surgery/ocular laser treatment of any 
kind, and no other dry eye treatments such as artificial tears, gels, or ointments or

Data from subjects discontinuing after randomization will be captured complete ly in the 
eCRF including Early Termination Visit and reason for discontinuation. 
 
8.4.3 Unscheduled Visits  
An unscheduled visit may be performed during the course of the trial in order to ensure subject safety  and/or to dispense additional IMP if necessary (i.e. damaged/lost or subject 
ran out of IMP in between visits) . All procedures performed at an unscheduled visit will be 
recorded in the source documents and on the unscheduled visit eCRF pages. Any 
unscheduled visit procedure listed  in the eCRF that is not pe rformed should be indicated as 
“not done.”  
 Evaluations that may be conducted at an unscheduled visit include:  
• Slit-Lamp biomicroscopy;  
• Visual a cuity;  
• Intraocular pressure ; 
• Dilated f undoscopy;  
• Urine pregnancy t est (for women of childbearing potential) ; 
• Assessment of AEs ; 
• Assessment of concomitant medications and/or treatments; and  
• Any other assessments needed in the judgment of the investigator. 
 
8.5 Compliance with Protocol  
Subjects will be instruc ted on proper instillation and storage of IMP at Visits 1, 2, and 3, 
and provided with w ritten instructions  (Appendix 2).  The used and unused IMP bottle s 
will be collected  from subjects at visits 2, 3 and 4 to assess subject dosing compliance .  
 
Subject dosing compliance will be determined by the subject’s response or lack thereof to the 
prompt “Was the dose taken?” in the subject diary. If more than 20% of the responses to the 
total expected dose -taken prompts are checked “no,” left blank, or missing, th en the subject will 
be deemed noncompliant for dosing and a deviation recorded  e.g., 12 checked “no,” left blank, 
or missing  at Visit 2 and Visit  3 and more than 24 at Visit 4.  
 
8.6 Subject D isposition

Confidential  Page  41 of 78 8.6.2 Discontinued subjects  
Notification of a subject discontinuation and the reason for discontinuation will be made 
to the CRO  and/or trial sponsor and will be clearly documented i n the eCR F as:  
• Adverse event ; 
• Protocol viola tion; 
• Lack of efficacy;  
• Administrative reason ( e.g. inability to continue, lost to follow up) ; 
• Sponsor termination of trial;  
• Subject choice ( e.g. withdrawal of consent);   
• Other 
Subjects m ust be discontinued as outlined in Section 5.6. 
Subjects who discontinue for any reason after randomization will not be replaced.  
 
8.7 Trial Termination  
The whole trial may be discontinued prematur ely in the event of any of the following:  
• New information leading to unfavorable risk- benefit judgment of the IMP , e.g. 
due to:  
o Occurrence of significant previously unknown adverse reactions or unexpectedly high intensity or incidence of known adverse reactions, or  
o Other unfavorable safety findings. 
• Sponsor’s decision that continuation of the trial is unjustifiable for medical or ethical reasons.  
• Poor enrollment of subjects making completion of the trial within an 
acceptable time frame unlikely.  
• Discont inuation of development of the s ponsor’s IMP.  
• Terminated or suspended upon request of Health Authorities. 
 
Health Authorities and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) / Independent Ethics 
Committees (IECs) will be informed about the discontinuation of  the trial in accordance 
with applicable regulations. 
 
8.8 Trial Duration  
An individual subjec t’s participation will involve 5 visits over approximately a 10- week 
period, including screening. After the trial, subjects  will be treated according to standard of 
care, at the discretion of the treating physician. The total duration of the trial from “first 
subject in ” to “last subject out ” is expected to be 8 months. 
 Subjects who completed trial NVU -003 without major protocol deviations, have been 
compliant with NVU -003 trial procedures and application of IMP  may be invited to enroll

NVU - 003 to assess the safety of topical NOV03 for the treatment of DED . 
9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered drug- related. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease occurring after the subject  signature of the ICF  without any judgment 
on causality . 
 
If there is a worsening of a medical condition that was present prior to Visit 0 , this should 
also be considered a new AE  and reported. Any medical condition present prior to the 
administration of the IMP  that remains unchanged or improved should not be re corded as 
an AE  at subsequent visits. 
 
Worsening of DED will be considered an AE  only if the dry eye status of the subject 
exceeds their previous experiences with the condition. This will be determined by the  
subject and  the investigator . 
 A clinically significant visual acuity worsening (defined as an increase of 0.22 or greater in 
logMAR score) from screening  (Visit 0) will be considered an Adverse Event. 
 IMP includes the investigational drug under evaluation and any comparator drug, placebo , 
or any other medications required by the protocol given during any stage of the trial. 
 Documentation regarding the AE  should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relation ship to IMP, expectedness, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of 
any sign or symptom observed by the physician or reported by the subject upon non-leading 
AE questioning. 
 AEs (both elicited and observed) and SAEs will be monitored throughout the trial. The 
investigator will promptly review all AEs  for accuracy and completeness. All AEs  will be 
documented on the appropriate source document and e CRF.  
 Adverse events recorded f rom the signing of informed consent through the last study visit 
must be reported, regardless of w hether or not the AEs are considered study- related.  
 
9.1.1 Severity  
Severity of an AE  is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE  
as determined by the investigator or reported to him/her by the subject. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of relationship to IMP  or seriousness of the event and s hould 
be evaluated according to the following scale:  
NOV03 (100% Perfluorohexyloctane)  Sponsor:  Bausch & Lomb, Incorporated  
Clinical Trial Protocol #  NVU- 003 27 AUG 2020 FINAL v4 .0 
 
Confidential  Page  43 of 78 • Mild : Event is noticeable to the subjec t but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere wi th the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe:  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy , and inte rferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
 
9.1.2 Relationship to Investigational Product  
The relationship of each AE to the investigational drug should be determined by the 
investigator using these explanations:  
• Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the investigational product 
caused the AE.  
• Not Suspected: A reasonable possibility does not exist that the investigational 
product caused the AE.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational  product caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest a causal relationship between the investigational product and the  AE include: a single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known 
to be strongly associated with IMP exposure  (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -
Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with I MP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the I MP (e.g., 
tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or  other 
events that commonly occur in the trial population independent of drug therapy) that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the I MP-treatment group than in a 
concurrent or historical control group. 
 
9.1.3 Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IMP . The active ingredient  of NOV03 is perfluorohexyloctane , which is a 
semifluorinated alkane with a well- established tolerability and safety profile. It has been  
tested in four PMCF studies and one phase 2 clinical trial up to now  with >370 subjects that 
received NOV03 treatment.  AEs of those studies have been listed in the Investigator’s 
Brochure . Therefore,  the following definitions  will be used : 
 
• Unexpected : An AE that is not listed in the i nvestigator ’s brochure in the Adverse 
Reaction  Section  at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
• Expected : An AE that is listed in the i nvestigator’s brochure in the Adverse 
Reaction Section at the specificity and s everity that has been observed.  
• Not Applicable : Any AE  that is unrelated to the IMP. 
The investigator should initially c lassif y the expectedness of  an AE, but the final 
classification  is subject to the sponsor `s determination .

Clinical Trial Protocol #  NVU- 003 27 AUG 2020 FINAL v4 .0 
 
Confidential  Page  44 of 78 9.1.4 Outcome  
The outcome of any AE will be determined and recorded using the following categories:  
 
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved 
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Lost to Follow -up 
• Fatal  
• Unknown 
 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator , medical monitor  or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death ; 
• A life-threatening AE ; 
o Note:  An AE is considered “li fe-threatening” if, in the view  of either the 
investigator , medical monitor  or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization ; 
o Note:  T he term “inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpatient admission (even 
if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long- term inpatients, inpatient admission 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive c are inpatient unit. 
Inpatient hospitalization does not include:  emergency room visits; outpatient/same -
day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; 
hospice facilities; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units . 
o Note:  T he term “prolongation of existing hospitalization” refers to any extension 
of an inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required for the reason for the initial admission as determined by the investigator or treating physician;  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions ; 
o Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes ( e.g. 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve).  
• A congenital anomal y/birth defect ; 
• Medically important 
o Important Medical Events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitaliza tion may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Clinical Trial Protocol # NVU- 003 27 AUG 2020 FINAL v4 .0 
 
Confidential  Page  45 of 78 9.3 Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to CRO, the trial sponsor, and the IRB/IEC 
as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities and recorded on the appropriate source document and eCRF page.  
 
9.3.1 Reporting a Serious A dverse Event 
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs , regardless of relationship to the IMP , must be 
immediately  (i.e. within a maximum 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the event)  
reported  to CRO  Drug  Safety   who will notify and forward documentation to the 
medical monitor and  the trial sponsor for review.  All information relevant to the SAE must 
be recorded on the appropriate SAE report form. Within 24 hours of knowledge of a new 
SAE, the investigator must enter the SAE  information into the SAE eCRF, complete the 
SAE cover letter  and send  both the SAE cover letter and a pdf of the SAE eCRF, along with 
redacted relevant source documents to the CRO /Drug  Safety    
  
 
The information  entered  must contain  sufficient  information  to enable medical  assessment  
by the m edical  monitor. At a minimum,  the initial SAE  report  should contain the following 
information: 
 
● Subject’s  trial ID number  
● Description of the Serious Adverse E vent 
● Date of the Serious Adverse Event  
● Criterion for seriousness 
● Preliminary assignment of causality to IMP 
 
All information relevant to the SAE  must be recorded on the appropriate case report forms. 
The investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by CRO  Drug 
Safety  r, CRO  and/or the sponsor in addition to that information reported on the 
case report form. All subjects experiencing a SAE  must be followed up and the outcome  
must be  reported. T he investigator must  obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent 
medical records, information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follo w-up of the subject; provide CRO  Drug Safety   and the trial  
sponsor with a complete case history, which includes a statement as to whether the event 
was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the IMP; and inform the IRB of the 
AE within their guidelines for reporting SAEs . 
 
All SAEs will be reported from the  signature of Informed Consent  until 30 days after the 
last administration of study drug.   All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise, explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.

Clinical Trial Protocol #  NVU- 003 27 AUG 2020 FINAL v4 .0 
 
Confidential  Page  46 of 78 Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAE information f rom subjects that 
completed the study, but investigators are encouraged to notify the Sponsor, or designee, 
of any SAEs of which they become aware occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or completed the study that they judge may be reasonably related to treatment with study drug.  
9.3.2 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
All SAEs  that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexp ected’ are to be reported to CRO  Drug Safety  
Navigator within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the e vent, via the SAE reporting 
process outlined above . All SAE/SUSARs will be promptly reported to t he IRB/IEC and 
governing health authorities (e .g., United State s Food and Drug Administration [FDA] ) as 
required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, and local regulations  and timelines . 
 
9.4 Procedures for Unmasking of IMP  
All subjects, investigators, and trial personnel involved with the conduct of the trial will be 
masked with regard to treatment assignments. The mask may be broken in exceptional 
circumstances.  
In a medical emergency, when the management of a subject’s condition requires knowledge 
of the treatment assignment, the investigator , or designee, will obtain the trial treatment 
assignment from the Interactive Response System (IRS). If possible, the medical 
emergency should be discussed with the m edical monitor prior to obtaining the treatment 
assignment, or as soon after as possible. The s ponsor may unmask for regulatory submission 
determination of an SAE when necessary ( see Section  0). 
In a non- emergency situation, when a code break is required, it must be discussed with the  
medical monitor  and/or CRO  Drug Safety  Navigator and the trial sponsor . The code break 
must be  approved in writing by the sponsor . 
If the randomization code for a subject is broken, the i nvestigator will record the date and 
reason for lifting the mask  for that subject in the source documents. Upon unmasking, t he 
subject will be withdrawn from the trial and should complete both the Early Termination and Follow -up procedures. 
 
9.5 Type and Duration of the Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
The investigator will follow unresolved AEs to resolution until the subject is lost to follow -
up or until the AE is otherwise classified. Resolution means the subject has returned to 
baseline state of health or the i nvestigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the AE. If the subject  is lost to follow -up, the i nvestigator should make 3 
reasonabl e attempts to contact the subject  via telephone, post, or certified mail. All follow -
up will be documented in the subject’s source document. Non- serious AEs identified on the 
last scheduled contact must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the status noted.

Confidential  Page  47 of 78 If the i nvestigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE  (i.e. 
resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new  SAE Report Form must be 
completed and faxed to CRO  Drug Safety  Navigator within  24 hours of the site’s awarene ss 
of the new information. The original SAE form is not to be altered , but a new SAE Report 
Form must be completed and identified consecutively based on the previous report form 
(i.e. Initial Report, Follow -up #1, Follow -up #2, etc .). The report must describe whether the 
event has resolved or continues and how the event was treated. 
 
9.6 Reporting Pregnancies 
Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE (unless there is a suspicion that the IMP 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication) . Pregnancy is an  
important medical event that must be followed up. Any pregnancy that occurs during the clinical  trial where the fetus could have been exposed to IMP  must be followed through the  
outcome of the pregnancy.   It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain the outcome and information of the fetus or infant within approximately 30 calendar days postpartum.  If a subject or investigator  suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to IMP 
administration, the IMP  must be withheld until the results of pregnancy testing are  
available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive IMP and must not be  
enrolled in the trial. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving IMP treatment, 
the IMP  must immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is  known. 
 If a female reports a pregnancy or  has a positive pregnancy test during the trial, then  the 
investigator must report the pregnancy and the outcome of the pregnancy to the CRO Dr ug 
Safety Associate within 24 hours of learning about the pregnancy and outcome 
of the pregnancy respectively . 
 A Pregnancy Report Form will be completed by the trial site’s principal investigator and sent to CRO Drug Safety  The CRO Drug Safety 
Navigator will forward the documentation to the medical monitor and the sponsor for 
review.  
 At the completion of the pregnancy, the Pregnancy Report Form is to be submitted to the 
CRO Drug Safety Navigator via the SAE contact details. The CRO Drug Safety  
will manage the query and reconciliation process until the pregnancy docum entation is 
complete.

Confidential  Page  48 of 78 10 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
10.1 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be considered:  
 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) – The FAS includes all randomized subjects who received at  least 
one dose of investigation al product. The primary analysis will be performed on the  FAS. 
Subjects in the FAS will be analyzed as randomized.  Per Protocol Set (PPS) – The PPS includes subjects in the FAS who do not have  significant 
protocol deviations and who complete the study. Protocol deviations will  be assessed prior 
to database lock and unmasking. The PPS will be analyzed using observed data only for 
efficacy variables. Subjects in the PPS will be analyzed as  treated.  
 Safety Set (SAF) – The SAF includes all random ized subjects who have received at  least 
one dose of the investigational product. The SAF will be analyzed for all safety  
assessments. Subjects in the SAF will be analyzed as treated.   
 The statistical analysis of safety data will be performed for the SAF.  The analysis of 
baseline and efficacy data will be performed for the FAS. The primary efficacy analyses will also be performed on the PPS as sensitivity analyses.  
10.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The primary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical fixed sequenc e in the following order.  
 
The statistical hypotheses for the primary endpoint of CFB  corneal fluorescein staining 
(NEI scale) total score at Day 57 are as follows:  
 H01: The difference, between study eyes treated with NOV03  and study eyes 
treated with saline, in the mean CFB  corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) 
total score at Day 57 = 0.  
 HA1:  The difference, between study eyes treated with NOV03 and study eyes 
treated with saline, in the mean CFB  corneal fluorescein sta ining (NEI scale) 
total score at Day 57 ≠ 0, with superiority claimed if the difference is less than 0 (NOV03 minus saline).  
The statistical hypotheses for the hierarchical primary endpoint of the CFB Dryness Score 
at Day 57 are as follows:  
 H
02: The diff erence, between subjects treated with NOV03 and subjects treated 
with saline, in the mean CFB  Dryness Score  at Day 57= 0.  
 HA2:  The difference, between subjects treated with NOV03 and subjects treated

Confidential  Page  49 of 78 with saline, in the mean CFB  Dryness Score at Day 57  ≠ 0, with superiority 
claimed if the difference is less than 0 (NOV03 minus saline) . 
 
Hierarchical fixed sequence testing will be employed to mai ntain the type I error rate  within 
the two primary endpoints . The primary analyses will first test the difference in the mean 
CFB  corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score between treatments at Day 57. If 
the test of the difference is statistically significant at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level in 
favor of NOV03 then the trial will be considered a success; NOV03 will be declared to be superior to saline in the mean CFB  corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at 
Day 57; and the diffe rence in the mean CFB  total Dryness Score  between treatments at Day 
57 will be tested at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level. 
 
If in addition to a statistically significant test of the difference in the mean CFB  corneal 
fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score at Day 57 is in favor of NOV03, and the test of 
the difference in the mean change from Dryness Score at Day 57 is also statistically significant in favor of NOV03, then NOV03 will be declared to be superior to saline in both 
the mean CFB  corneal fluorescein staining (NEI scale) total score and the mean CFB  of the 
Dryness Score at Day 57. 
 
10.3  Sample Size  
  
 
 
 
. 
The study has been designed to have at least 95% power to reject both H 01 and H 02 assuming 
independence between the sign and symptom endpoint; positive correlation between these 
two endpoints would increase the overall power.  
Two hundred fifty (250) subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 97.9% power to 
reject H 01 in favor of  HA1 and conclude superiority of NOV03 over saline in the mean CFB 
tCFS score at Day 57 assuming a true difference (NOV03 minus saline) of -1.0, a common 
standard deviation of 2.8, and a two- sided alpha = 0.05. Two hundred fifty (250) subjects 
per treatmen t group yields 97.9% power to reject H 02 in favor of H A2 and conclude 
superiority of NOV03 over saline in the mean CFB Dryness Score (VAS) at Day 57 assuming a true difference (NOV03 minus saline) of - 10, a common standard deviation of 
28, and a two-sided alpha = 0.05. Accounting for an assumed 10% subject discontinuation 
rate, approximately  560 subjects (280 subject each arm) will be randomly assigned to trial 
treatment such that approximately 250 evaluable participants per arm complete the trial.

Confidential  Page  50 of 78 Therefo re, assuming independence between tCFS score and Dryness Score (VAS), 250 
FAS subjects per treatment group at Day  57 yields 97.9% * 97.9% = 95.8% power to reject 
both H 01 and H 02. 
 
10.4 Statistical Analysis  
10.4.1 General Considerations  
Quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum. The qualitative variables will be summarized 
using counts and percentages.  
All summaries will be presented by treatment group . Summaries will be provided for 
demographics, baseline medical history, concurrent therapies, and subject disposition.  
For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent therapies, and AE s will be 
coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate.  
Baseline measures are defined as the last non- missing measure prior to the initiation of 
randomized study treatment . 
All primary and secondary analyses will be two -sided at a significance level of 0.05. 
 
10.4.2 Unit of Analysis  
For efficacy endpoints, the  unit of analysis will be the study eye as defined by the following:  
Study Eye: Eyes are eligible for analysis if they meet all of the inclusion criteria. In the case 
that both eyes are eligible for analysis, the worst eye shall be chosen, and this will be  defined 
as the eye with worse (higher)  total corneal staining  at Visit 1 . If the total corneal staining 
is the same in both eyes then the right e ye will be selected as the study eye.  
 
10.4.3 Missing Data  
The primary analysis will be completed on the FAS with available data per subject , 
assuming the overall study discontinuation rate is <5% .  If the overall study 
discontinuation rate is ≥5% then the primary analysis will be based on the primary 
imputation methodology as defined Section 10.4.5 and the available data analyses will 
become robustness  analyses.  
Additionally, robustness analyses will include repeating the primary analysis on the per 
protocol set (PPS); the FAS imputing missing data using last observation carried forward (LOCF); the FAS imputing missing data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputa tion methodology under different assumptions of missingness (at random 
and not at random) each using 30 imputed values . 
 The imputation model, for each visit, under the assumption of missing at  random is:

10.4.4 Multiplicity Consideration 
To control for inflation of type 1 error rate due to multiple hypotheses, the analysis of the two primary endpoints will be conducted in a hierarchical manner.  
 If both primary endpoints demonstrate statistically significant superiority of NOV03 versus saline at the two -sided alpha = 0.05 level, the following seconda ry endpoints will be tested 
hierarchically  to maintain an overall two -sided alpha = 0.05.  
1. CFB  of Dryness Score (VAS) at Day  15 
2. CFB  in total Corneal Fluorescein Staining (tCFS) (NEI scale) at Day  15  
3. CFB  of VAS burning/ stinging at Day 57  
4. CFB  in central Corneal Fluorescein Staining (cCFS) (NEI scale) at Day  57

 The primary comparison in this trial will be between NOV03 versus saline at Day  57. The 
primary efficacy endpoints (e.g. CFB  in total corneal fluorescein staining [NEI scale] and 
Dryness Score ) will be  tested using hierarchical fixed sequence testing  and summarized 
descriptively (n, mean, standard deviation, median, min,  and max) and analyzed separately 
using an ANCOVA model with terms for baseline value, and treatment.  
 
Least squares mean for each treatment group and for the difference between treatment 
groups will be presented from each  model together with two -sided p- values (used for 
primary inference) and 95% confidence intervals.  
 Two-sample t -tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests and mixed- effect repeated measures analysis 
comparing treatment groups will be performed as sensitivity analyses. The mixed -effect 
repeated measures mod el will include treatment, baseline value , visit, and the interaction 
between treatment and  visit as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect. An unstructured

however, if the model fails to converge using this covariance structure, either heterogeneous 
TOEPLITZ, homogeneous TOEPLITZ, or compound symmetry will be implemented 
according to the Akaike information criterion with a correction for finite  sample sizes 
(AICc). 
 
10.4.6  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The following secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically:  
 
1. CFB  of Dryness Score (VAS) at Day  15. 
2. CFB  in tCFS (NEI scale) at Day  15.  
3. CFB  VAS burning/ stinging at Day 57.  
4. CFB  in central Corneal Fluorescein Staining (cCFS) (NEI scale) at Day  57. 
 Inference will only be made on these endpoints, at a 2- sided alpha = 0.05, if both primary 
endpoints and any higher order secondary endpoints are statistically significant at a 2 -sided  
alpha = 0.05 in favor of NOV03 . 
Quantitative secondary efficacy endpoint s will be summarized similarly to the primary 
effiacy endpoints. 
The primary analysis of the  secondary endpoint s will use the FAS with available data per 
subject , assuming the overall study discontinuation rate is <5% . If the overall study 
discontinuation rate is ≥5% , then the primary analysis of the secondary endpoints will be 
based on imputation methodology as def ined in Section 10.4.5 and the available data 
analyses will become robustness analyses.  
 
10.4.7 Other Pre -specified  Efficacy Analyses  
The analyses of other pre -specified endpoints will use the Full Analysis Set (FAS) with 
available data per subject.  
 
1. CFB of Dryness Score (VAS) at Day  29. 
2. CFB in tCFS at Day  29. 
3. CFB in CFS central and inferior sub- regions (NEI scale) to each measured post -baseline 
visit.  
4. Proportion of tCFS responders ( ≥3 improvement based on NEI scale) at Day 57. 
5. Proportion of Dryness Score responders ( ≥30 % improvement from baseline) at Day 57.

verification of the data and/or clinical trial procedures. Access to this information will be 
permitted to the aforementioned individuals t o the extent permitted by law.  
 A report of the results of this trial may be published or sent to the appropriate hea lth 
authorities in any country in which the IMP  may ultimately be marketed, but the subject’s 
identity will not be  disclosed in these documents.  
 
11.4 Documentation  
Source documents may include a subject’s medical records, hospital charts, clinic charts, the investigator’s trial subject files , as well as t he results of diagnostic tests such as X -rays, 
laboratory tests , and EKGs. The investigator’s electronic copy of t he eCRFs  serves as the 
investigator’s record of a subject’s trial- related data.  
11.4.1 Retention of D ocumentation 
All trial related correspondence, subject  records, consent forms, record of the distribution 
and use of all IMP  and copies of case report forms s hould be maintained on file for at least 
two years after the last appr oval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there 
are no pending or  contemplated marketing application s in an ICH region; or until at least 
two years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP . 
These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when th ese documents no longer need to be 
retained.  The investigator must notify the s ponsor prior to destroying trial documentation 
even after the above- mentioned time has passed.  
 If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keeping trial records, custody must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address 
of the new custodian.  
 
11.5 Recording of Data on Source Documents and Electronic Case Reports 
Forms (eCRFs)  
All subjec t data will be captured in the subject  source documents which will be entered into  
the eCRFs  in the Electronic Data Captur e System (EDC) . The investigator is responsible 
for ensuring that trial data is completely and accurately recorded in the  source documents,  
data entered into each subject’s eCRF  and all trial- related materials. All trial data should 
also be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, and original. Recorded dat a should only be 
corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or render illegible the previous entry (e.g., by drawing a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to 
the corrected data).

Instr uctions for Use  
Subjects will be instructed to instill one drop in each eye four times daily  as illustrated 
below . Subjects will be instructed to use a second drop only if the first drop misses the 
eye. Subjects will be given detailed instructions on study drug administration (see below) , 
accountability, and storage. 
Note: On day of study Visits 2, 3 and 4, subjects should make sure that their dose of the study drug is instilled at least 2 hours before the start time of the visit.  
 Proper Handling of Eye drop Container  
 Note: Please contact study site staff immediately for replacement if you notice any damage with study drug container.  
 Figure A . Opening the bottle  
1. Unscrew the cap of the bottle.  
2. Prior to the first administration of the study drug you must separate the cap from the safety seal ring below the cap and remove it . 
3. Do not touch the dropper after removing the cap. 4. To avoid loss of solution please read steps 5 to 7  carefully before applying the eye 
drops. 
5. Hold the opened bottle with the dropper pointing upwards and gently press the bottle between thumb and index finger . 
6. Keep the bottle under slight pressure and turn the bottle until the dropper points  
downwards.  
7. With the dropper pointing downw ards reduce the pressure on the bottle to allow some 
air to flow into the bottle . 
Figure B . Instilling the drop  
1. Lean your head back slightly and carefully pull down your lower eyelid. Look upwards.  
2. Hold the opened bottle with the dropper pointing dow nwards above your eye. Apply 
gentle pressure on the bottle and administer 1 drop per eye.  
Note:  Due to the special properties of the study drug you may not feel the drop falling 
into your eye. In this case we recommend application in front of a mirror.  
3. Do not touch the dropper with your eye or lashes.

Study Procedures  
 
1. Background/Rationale (previously iStar section 11  (exempt) or 12 (expedited/full board )) 
Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and a 
leading cause of death worldwide.  Lifetime risk of hypertension is 70 -90%, but it is 
higher among adults who are older and of low socio -economic status (SES).    Older 
age an d lower SES are also associated with low health literacy, which undermines 
understanding of health information.   Yet, low health literacy in hypertension 
patients is an independent predictor of poor blood pressure control,   with only about 
50% of hyperte nsion patients having controlled blood pressure.   Possibly, patients 
with lower health literacy find it harder to interpret whether blood pressure readings 
are high or low, reflect good or bad blood pressure control, and indicate a need for 
behavior chang e or medication use.  Even college -educated hypertension patients 
who have bought home blood pressure monitors may struggle to interpret blood 
pressure readings that are outside the normal range, undermining their intentions to 
improve their blood pressure  control.   
 
BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE INSIGHT  
Lab studies in behavioral science have found that individuals’ ability to interpret 
numbers (likely including blood pressure readings) is improved by showing the range 
or distribution – also called ‘reference information’.  In preliminary work, the PI 
show ed that many people struggle to interpret credit card APRs, because they do not 
know what numbers are good or bad.  In line with the behavioral science insight, the 
PI found that providing graphs with ranges of existing APRs helped recipients to see 
which credit cards posed a bad deal, and reduced their intentions to get such credit 
cards. It has been posited that providing reference information (e.g. normal and 
abnormal blood pressure ranges) should also help hypertension patients to interpret 
blood pressu re readings, and help them to control their blood pressure.   
If reference information is used when communicating blood pressure readings in 
clinics and online health records, it often involves a basic table that only shows the 
normal range (e.g., <120 for  systolic and <80 for diastolic blood pressure). In one 
behavioral science study, 106 university staff performed similarly when using this 
  3 
 
basic table or when using a color -coded horizontal bar graph (showing the normal 
range in white and values outside th e normal range in black).   However, neither 
format followed the American Heart Association’s communication, which shows 
more reference information for interpreting blood pressure readings outside of the 
normal range.  Hypertension patients may need to see  such enhanced reference 
information, because they are more likely to encounter blood pressure readings 
outside of the normal range. Moreover, those readings can be harder to interpret – 
perhaps especially for hypertension patients with low health literacy . The 
investigators propose to evaluate 2 formats for providing the more enhanced 
reference information from the American Heart Association, in either a table (as used 
by the American Heart Association), or a graph (as used by Blood Pressure UK, to be 
adap ted to show the information from the American Heart Association). The 
behavioral science literature suggests that tables facilitate reading specific numbers, 
but that graphs help more with interpreting numbers as high or low, and good or bad 
– though that could depend on recipients’ health literacy.   
 
2. Purpose/Objectives/Aims/Research Questions  (previously iStar section 11  (exempt) or 12 
(expedited/full board) ) 
Aim 1: Based on existing communications, and the PI's communication expertise, the 
investigators will generate 3 blood pressure communications:  
(A) a basic table showing only the normal range, which is often used but may make it hard to 
interpret numbers outside of the normal range, potentially undermining behavior change 
intentions;  
(B) an enhanced  table with more reference information, showing how combinations of diastolic 
and systolic blood pressure reflect normal, elevated and hypertension ranges, from the 
American Heart Association;  
(C) an enhanced graph to be adapted from Blood Pressure UK to s how the same color -coded 
ranges as the enhanced table, with diastolic blood pressure on the x -axis and systolic blood 
pressure on the y -axis.  
Aim 2: In a sample of 650 diagnosed hypertension patients recruited through the Pitt+Me 
Patient Registry at the U niversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), the investigators will 
evaluate whether being presented with the enhanced table or graph (vs. basic table) increases 
the likelihood of self -reported blood pressure measurement, and improves interpretations of 
blood pressure readings and behavior change intentions.  
Aim 3: The investigators will examine whether Aim 2 findings vary by health literacy, age, and 
SES.     
 
3. Participants (sample)  (Consistent with iStar sections 10 (expedited and full board ) and 22  (for 
all submission types ) 
• The sample will include 625 diagnosed hypertension patients (age 18 and older  and 
proficient in english ) recruited through the Pitt+Me Patient Registry at the University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center.  
• Inclusion criteria include diagnosis with high blood pressure or hypertension , age 18 and 
up, being able to understand and read English . 
• Children and minors under the age of 18 are not included because children and 
adolescents require different blood press ure communications than those tested in this 
study.  This is due to these age groups facing different challenges in blood pressure 
monitoring, and the normal range being different for younger indivduals than for adults.   
  4 
 
• Employees or students, pregnant wom en, prisoners and detainees, and military 
personnel will not be explicitly targeted by this study and are unlikely to be reached 
through the Pitt+Me Patient Registry.  However, if they happen to access an invitation to 
the study through the Pitt + Me Patie nt Registry, they will also not be excluded from this 
study, as long as they meet eligibility criteria.  
• Adults who are not competent to consent and non -english speaking populations will not 
be included in the study.  English language proficiency is one of the inclusion criteria 
because this study involves a self -administered online survey in English.  
 
4. Recruitment/Screening Process (sampling strategy)   
a. Participants will be recruited through the Pitt + Me Patient Registry at the University 
of Pittsburgh in P ittsburgh Pennsylvania.  The study involves a self -administered 
online survey, so participants can access the online survey from their preferred 
location . 
b. Participants will be recruited by the Pitt + Me Patient Registry, through email and 
online advertisem ents targeting Pitt + Me Patient Registry members who are 
hypertension patients, 18+ years of age and able to read and understand  english.  
c. The Pitt + Me Patient Registry  will use email and online advertisements for 
recruitment .  Participants will receive a link to our online survey, which will start with 
an information sheet followed by an online screener in which they will be asked to 
confirm that they have been diagnosed with hypertension, are 18+ years old, and are 
proficient in English. The information  sheet and the screener questions have been 
submitted to the IRB as part of the uploaded survey.  
d. In the screener questions, p articipants will be asked to report whether they have 
been told by a doctor or nurse that they have  hypertension  (yes/no/don’t know ), 
their age, and whether they are able to read and understand English  (yes/no) .  They 
will be invited to proceed to the survey if they meet the eligibility criteria of a 
hypertension diagnoses, being at least 18 years old, and being able to read and 
under stand English.  
i. The full survey including  the screening questions has been uploaded  to Istar . 
ii. Participants will receive an information sheet before they are screened , which 
is also part of the survey we have uploaded to Istar .   
 
5. Methods  (previously iStar  sections 9, 12, or 13, 16, 19, 20, and 21 depending on the type of 
study/application)  
a. Provide a detailed description of the project from start to finish. Use lay language, as if 
you were describing your study to a potential participant.  
i. Participants will be recruited through emails and online advertisements  from the 
Pitt+Me Registry . They will be entitled: “Blood pressure survey. ”  They will read: 
“This online survey asks about your blood pressure  and what you think about 
communications about blood pressur e readings .  The online survey will take about 
20 minutes to complete.  Eligible participants must have been diagnosed with 
hypertension, be 18 years of age, and be able to read and understand English. Age: 
18 and up. Duration: About 20 minutes. Visits: No  in-person visits. Location: online 
survey. Compensation: $10  gift card ” Further information will state:  Study basics: 
Do you have high blood pressure or hypertension ? You are invited to  answer an 
online survey about blood pressure readings.  You will als o be asked what you think 
about communications about blood pressure readings. The online survey will take 
  5 
 
about 20 minutes.  Eligible participants will have been told by a doctor or nurse that 
they have high blood pressure or hypertension, must be at least  18 years old, and 
must be able to read and understand English.  Study Purpose: This study aims to 
help you and others to interpret blood pressure readings.  The researchers hope to 
make blood pressure readings easier to understand.  Could this study be ri ght for 
you: - Ever been told by a doctor or nurse that you have high blood pressure or 
hypertension. – Ages 18 and up. – Able to read and understand English.  What 
participants can expect: Participation involves completing an online survey about 
blood pre ssure readings.  USC IRB: UP-21-00023 ] Research Areas: Heart and 
Circulation, Blood/Lymphatic System. Meet the Researcher .  The photo, name , job 
title, and research  of the PI and her collaborator at the University of Pittsburgh will 
be included.  
ii. After clicking on the link to the online survey, participants will receive the 
information sheet that is part of the survey we have uploaded to Istar.  They will 
then receive the screening questions that ask about diagnosis with high blood 
pressure or hype rtension, age, and proficiency in English.  Eligible participants will 
be randomly assigned to one of three  blood pressure communications as part of an 
online survey, which can be seen as part of the survey we have  uploaded  to Istar .  
Subsequent questions ask for responses to and interpretations of the 
communications, including willingness to measure own blood pressure, followed by 
questions about familiarity  with communications  about blood pressure , experience 
with high blood pressure, health literacy, color blindness and demographics  such as 
age and SES .  After completing the survey, participants will receive a link to another 
survey in which they will fill in their email address so that we can email them a $10 
Amazon gift certificate.   Participants can al so indicate whether they want to receive 
a description of the findings, once they are available.  At the end of the survey, 
participants will receive a link to information from the American Heart Association 
about how to control their blood pressure.  In th e unlikely event that any 
participants report blood pressure numbers that reflect a hypertensive crisis 
((systolic BP>=180mmHg or diastolic BP>=120 mgHg) , they will immediately receive 
the message “ Based on American Heart Association blood pressure values of 
180/120 mm Hg or higher reflect a hypertensive crisis for most people. You have 
reported blood pressure of 180/120 mm Hg or higher. Please call 911 immediately 
and seek emergency care. Upon return from the medical treatment of this event, 
please call (412) 638 -5875 to notify our study staff. ” 
iii. No questions will be asked or uncovered about participants’ suicidality.  
iv. We will not be collecting personal identifiable information as part of the survey.  
The Pitt + Me Registry will be sending our advertisemen ts to their members, but we 
will not have access to their personal information or their contact information.  
Hence our survey will be anonymous.  After completing the survey, we will ask 
participants for their email address so that we can send them a but that 
information will not be kept with their data.   Thus, the survey data will not be 
labeled with any personal identifying information such as name, email address, or 
IP address, or a code that the research team can link to personal identifying 
informatio n.  Email addresses will be deleted after the study has closed and all 
participants have been paid  and the results of the study emailed to interested 
participants.  
v. Anonymized data will be kept on pass -word protected computers.   
  6 
 
vi. Findings will be reported o n clinicaltrials.gov 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  They will also be written up for 
submission to a peer -reviewed journal and peer -reviewed conferences .  
Participants who have indicated an interest in receiving the findings will recei ve 
them via email.   
b. Instrumentation  
i. Questionnaires/ Survey Measures (names and citations)  
A. Our survey questions have been developed by the PI, Co-I, and team , and 
adapted from the PI’s  previous work on understanding graphical 
communications in other contexts (Chin A, Bruine de Bruin, W. JEP:Applied 
2019; 25: 77 -87).  Health literacy will be assessed with a validated measure 
(Chew LD, et al. Fam Med 2004; 36: 588 -594).  
ii. Qualitative instrum ents  
A. The only open -ended questions on the survey will ask participants to fill in 
blood pressure readings .  No open -ended text responses are requested.  
c. Data Analysis  
i. Data analysis of the anonymous dataset will be conducted in SPSS to test whether 
Briefly describe how the data analysis will be conducted .  We will evaluate the 
relative effect of the 3 communications on the likelihood of measuring blood 
pressure, and understanding and interpretations of blood pressure readings, and 
behavior change intentions , and assess interactions with health literacy, age and 
SES.  We will control for other demographics, hypertension diagnosis date, 
familiarity with blood pressure readings, and color blindness .  Linear regressions 
will be used for continuous dependent varia bles and logistic regressions for 
dichotomous dependent variables.  
ii. If conducting secondary data analysis from a data set obtained from an existing 
data source, upload the data collection form(s) identifying the variables to be 
captured and analyzed in iSta r section 13.

According to the American Heart Association, blood pressure can be controlled by making 
healthy changes, such as eating a diet high in fruit and vegetables, reaching and main taining a 
healthy  weight,  getting  regular  physical  activity,  limiting  salt intake,  limiting  alcohol  intake,  and 
quitting the use of tobacco products.

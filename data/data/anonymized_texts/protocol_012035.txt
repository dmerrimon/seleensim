CONFIDENTIAL 3PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
PROTOCOL SD-809-C-20
TITLE An Open -Label, Long -Term Safety Study of SD -809 (deutetrabenazine) for the 
Treatment of Moderate to Severe Tardive Dyskinesia
PHASE 3 (Safety)
INDICATION Treatment of drug -induced tardive dyskinesia (TD)
NO. SITES Approximately 80
OBJECTIVES To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long -term maintenance therapy with 
SD-809
To evaluate the efficacy of long -term maintenance therapy of SD -809 to reduce 
the severity of abnormal involuntary movements of TD
To evaluate the persistence of the therapeutic effect of SD -809
STUDY 
POPULATIONMale and female adult subjects with moderate to severe drug -induced TD who have 
successfully completed a previous placebo -controlled efficacy study of SD -809 for 
the treatment of TD with the Sponsor wil l be enrolled.
STUDY 
DESIGNThis is an open- label, single -arm study in which subjects with moderate to severe TD 
who have successfully completed a parent study (Study SD -809-C- 18, Study 
SD-809-C- 23, or any other controlled study of SD -809 for the treatment of moderate 
to severe TD) will be invited to participate.
Informed consent/assent ( Part A )will be obtained before any study procedures are 
performed. Subjects may have informed consent/assent obtained up to 30 days in 
advance of the subject’s parent study Week 13 Visit/TD -Long Term Safety (LTS) 
Baseline Visit. 
Informed consent/assent for Part B will be obtained after Amendment 06 
implementation and before any study procedures related to Part B are perfor med.
Informed consent/assent for Part C will be obtained after Amendment 07 
implementation and before any study procedures related to Part C are performed. 
Subjects who do not sign the informed consent/assent for Part C will complete the 
study at Part B Follow -up Call. 
Subjects who have successfully completed a parent study may be eligible to enroll 
into this study after they complete a 1 -week washout period and the final evaluation 
in the parent study. To reduce subject burden, after obtaining informed 
consent/assent, some data collected in the parent study will be used in Study 
SD-809-C- 20 and will provide some of the baseline data for Study SD -809-C- 20 (see 
Schedule of Events ). For example, in addition to assessments completed for the 
SD-809-C- 18 Week 13 visit, evaluations required as part of the SD -809-C- 20 study 
will be completed on the same day as the Week 13 visit. 
Part A :
Titration Period (up to 6 weeks): As subjects will have discontinued study drug 
(SD-809 or placebo) for 1 week at completion of the parent study, they will undergo 
SD-809 dose titration in this study. During titration, the Investigator, in consultation 
with the subject, will determine whe n an adequate level of dyskinesia control has 
been achieved. The dose of SD -809 should be adjusted (upward or downward), in 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 4STUDY 
DESIGN 
(continued)increments of 6 mg per day (up to once per week), until there is adequate control of 
dyskinesia, the subject experiences a protocol -defined clinically significant adverse 
event (defined as related to study drug and either a) moderate or severe in intensity or 
b) meets the criteria for a serious adverse event), or the maximal allowable dose is 
reached. If a subject experiences a clinica lly significant adverse event attributable to 
SD-809, the Investigator will determine if a dose reduction, dose suspension, or 
withdrawal from the study is necessary. 
Subjects will have a telephone contact at Week 1 and a clinic visit at Week 2 to 
evaluat e safety and establish a dose of study drug that adequately controls dyskinesia 
and is well tolerated. Although subjects will enter the Long -Term Treatment Period 
after Week 2, titration should continue through Week 6 to optimize dose.
Long -Term Treatment Period (Week 3 until the last dose in Part A ): During 
long-term treatment, subjects will continue titration through Week 6. During titration, 
all subjects will be contacted by telephone at Week 3(the first week of the Long -
Term Treatment Period) and Week 5 and will return to the clinic at Week 4 and Week 
6 for evaluation of safety and dyskinesia control. Subjects who have not achieved a 
dose level that adequately controls dyskinesia and is well tolerated by the Week 6 
visit should have unscheduled visits or telephone contacts to further adjust their dose 
upward or downward. Interactions with the clinical site for dose adjustment should 
alternate between telephone contacts and clinic visits. During the remainder of the 
Long- Term  Treatment Period, subjects w ill return to the clinic for evaluation of safety 
and dyskinesia once every 13 weeks, starting at Week 15 and ending at the last dose
of Part A (completion of Part A =Week 158 or beginning of Part B after Amendment 
06 implementation). During long- term treatment, further dose adjustments of SD -809 
may be made, if necessary, but not more often than weekly and only in increments of 
6 mg per day. Dose adjustments should be based on all available i nformation, 
including the subject’s and caregiver’s (if appropriate) reports of adverse events and 
dyskinesia control, as well as information from rating scales and safety evaluations, 
when available. If warranted, study sites are encouraged to conduct per iodic phone 
calls with subjects to ensure adherence to the treatment regimen and retention of 
unused drug containers.
Subjects who have been on a stable dose of SD -809 and any concomitant dopamine 
receptor antagonist (DRA) for a minimum of 4 weeks will be invited to participate in 
the Randomized Withdrawal Period (Part B) at the next routine visit at the site after 
approvals from IRB/Ethics Committee and as required by country regulations. If the 
subject chooses to participate in Part B, then participation in Part A will end. Subjects 
who decline to participate in Part B will continue in Part A until Week 158. Subjects 
who decline participation in Part B will be given an ongoing option to participate at 
subsequent study visits.
Part B :
Part B will consist of a double -blind, randomized withdrawal period; treatment with 
SD-809; and post -treatment safety follow -up. The Randomized Withdrawal Period 
will be 1 week (+3 days maximum) in duration and will consist of 2 visits, the 
Pre-withdrawal Visit and the Post-withdrawal V isit. After the Randomized 
Withdrawal Period, the subject will resume treatment with SD -809 on the prior 
established dose for an additional 12 weeks until end of treatment (EOT). A follow -up 
telephone call will occur 4 weeks after EOT.
At the beginning of the Randomized Withdrawal Period, subjects will be randomized 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 5in a blinded fashion to either SD -809 (current dose) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio stratified 
by DRA usage. Up to 194subjects (active subjects as of the approval date of 
Amendment 06) will be randomized (SD -809 or placebo). Subjects will be required to 
sign a written informed consent. 
Subjects will need to be on a stable dose of SD -809 and any concomitant DRA for a 
minimum of 4 weeks before starting the Randomized Withdrawal Period.
Subjects will be scheduled to return 1 week (+3 days maximum) after the 
Pre-withdrawal Visitof the Randomized Withdrawal Period for efficacy and safety
assessments. 
At the end of this period, subjects will continue treatment with SD -809 at the previous
dose administered before the Randomized Withdrawal Period (last dose in Part A). 
Treatment with SD -809 will continue for 12 weeks until the EOT visit.
Video ratings of the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) will occur at the 
Pre-withdrawal Visit, the Post-withdrawal Visit, and the EOT/early termination (ET) 
visit.
Part C:
Part C will consist of a 52 -week period of reduced burde n safety assessments, for 
subjects in the EU countries . Subjects can only enter Part C once they have entered 
and completed Part B. The Part B EO Twill coincide with Part C Visit 1 for those 
subjects who are willing to continue with the 52 -week reduced burden safety 
assessment period.
Post- Treatment Safety Follow -up:
Part A :
Subjects who do not participate in Part B will continue in Part A, discontinue study 
drug at the Week 158 visit ,and return for their final clinic visit at Week 159 for 
evaluation of safety, dyskinesia control, and motor function. During this 1 -week 
follow -up period, subjects should continue to not take prohibited concomitant 
medications. Subjects will also have a follow -up telephone contact at Week 162, 
4weeks after their last dose of study drug, to evaluate adverse events and 
concomitant medication usage.
Subjects who discontinue study drug in Part A will complete an ET visit; a follow -up 
clinic visit 1 week later to evaluate safety, dyskinesia, and motor function; and a 
follow -up telephone contact 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug to evaluate the 
adverse events and concomitant medication use since ET.
Part B :
Subjects who complete the Randomized Withdrawal Period and subsequent 12 weeks 
of treatment will complete an EOT visit and a follow -up telephone contact 4 weeks 
after the last dose of study drug to evaluate the adverse events and concomitant 
medication use since EOT . Subjects in EU countries may choose to enroll in Part C, 
in which case PartB EOT will coincide with Part C Visit 1 .
Subjects who discontinue study drug in Part B will complete an ET visit; a follow -up 
clinic visit 1 week later to evaluate safety, dyskinesia, and motor function; and a 
follo w-up telephone contact 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug to evaluate the 
adverse events and concomitant medication use since ET.
Part C :
Subjects who complete the 52 weeks of reduced burden safety assessments period 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 6will compl ete a Part C EOT Visit and a follow -up telephone contact 4 weeks after the 
last dose of study drug to evaluate the adverse events and concomitant medication use 
since Part C EOT. Subjects who discontinue study drug in Part C will complete an ET 
visit, a fol low-up clinic visit 1 week later for safety evaluation, and a follow -up 
telephone contact 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug to evaluate the adverse 
events and concomitant medication use since ET.
FORMULATION SD-809 tablets will be provided in dosage strengths of 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 mg. 
During dose adjustment/titration in Part A , SD-809 will be supplied in weekly blister 
cards. During long -term treatment, SD -809 will be supplied in 30 -count bottles. 
During the blinded Randomized Withdrawal Peri od, SD -809 will be supplied in 
20-count bottles, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white) , whereas 
during long- term treatment, SD -809 will be supplied in 30-count bottles . Placebo 
tablets are identical in appearance to the SD -809 tablet s and contain the same inactive 
ingredients as the SD -809 tablets. During Part C, SD -809 will be supplied in 30- count 
bottles.
DOSE 
REGIMENStudy drug will be administered as follows:
All treatment regimens will be administered twice daily (BID) with meals, 
approximately 10 hours apart during the day.
The starting dose will be SD -809 12 mg/day (6 mg BID) regardless of previous 
treatment in the parent trial. Prior treatment assignment from the parent trial will 
remain blinded.
The maximum total daily dose of SD -809 is based on body weight:
oIf body weight < 100 kg, the maximum daily dose is 48 mg/day (24 mg 
BID) unless the subject is on a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (paroxetine, 
fluoxetine, or bupropion), in which case the maximum total daily dose is 
36mg/day. 
oIf body weight ≥100 kg the maximum daily dose is 60 mg/day (30 mg 
BID) unless the subject is on a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (paroxetine, 
fluoxetine, or bupropion), in which case the maximum daily dose is 
42mg/day
Daily doses will be administered according to instructions provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.
During the titration period, the dose of SD -809 should be increased on a weekly 
basis in increments of 6 mg per day until:
oThere is adequate control of dyskinesia; 
oThe subject experiences a protocol defined clinically significant adverse 
event (defined as re lated to study drug and either a) moderate or severe in 
intensity or b) meets the criteria for a serious adverse event); or 
oThe maximal allowable dose is reached. 
If a subject experiences a clinically significant adverse event attributable to 
SD-809, the Investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is 
necessary. 
Part A
Long- Term  Treatment :
For all subjects participating in the Long -Term  Treatment Period, the dose of SD -809 
may be adjusted (upward or downward) in increments of 6 mg per day, if necessary, 
to optimize dyskinesia control while minimizing adverse events. However, such 
changes in dose may not occur more frequently than once per week. In the case of the

greater dose reduction may be required. Dose reductions in this context should be 
reviewed with the Medical Monitor.
Part B
Double- Blind, Randomized Withdrawal Period:
Subjects in the Randomized Withdrawal Period will continue to receive their current 
dose of SD -809 or will receive matching placebo. At the end of the Randomized 
Withdrawal Period, subjects will continue with, or return to, the same dose of SD -809 
taken before the Randomized Withdrawal Period (last dose in Part A), beginning the 
day after the Post-withdrawal Visit and continuing for 12 weeks. Subjects who do not 
return for the Post-withdrawal Visit within the 10 days (1 week [+3 days maximum]) 
may be required to undergo titration, as decided by the Investigator in consultation 
with the Medical Monitor (if necessary).
Part C
52-Week Treatment Period:
Subjects in Part C will continue treatment with SD -809 at the dose administered 
during the 12 -week open -label treatm ent period of Part B (last dose in Part B) ,unless 
they will experience a delay in the completion of all the activities related to Part B 
EOT V isit,especially of study drug dispensation , in which case they may be required 
to undergo titration, as decided by the Investigator in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor.
SAMPLE SIZE Approximately 330 subjects (eligible subjects who completed a previous controlled 
study of SD -809 for treatment of moderate to severe TD) may enroll in Part A . 
During the Randomized Withdrawal Period in Part B , there will be up to 194 subjects

(items 1 through 7) as assessed by blinded central video rating to the Post -
withdrawal Visit between subjects treated with SD -809 and subj ects treated with 
placebo.
STATISTICS Safety:
Safety data will be summarized descriptively for the overall population and based on 
prior treatment (SD -809 or placebo) in the parent study. Descriptive statistics will be 
calculated for quantitative data and frequency counts and percentages will be 
provided for categorical data. The nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events 
will be tabulated for all subjects combined and by prior treatment. Baseline, within 
study, end of study, an d change -from -baseline values for clinical laboratory 
evaluations and vital signs will be summarized as appropriate.
Treatment -emergent adverse events and laboratory, vital sign, and ECG parameters 
will be summarized. In addition, change from baseline will be summarized for 
laboratory and vital sign parameters. Shift tables will be provided for clinical 
laboratory results. ECG results will be classified as normal and abnormal and 
summarized.
Descriptive statistics of change -from -baseline will use the Baseli ne from the present 
study and will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
Efficacy:
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize efficacy measures for the overall 
population and based on prior treatment (SD -809 or placebo) in the parent study.
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for quantitative data and frequency counts and 
percentages will be provided for categorical data. 
Descriptive statistics of change -from -baseline will utilize Baseline from the present 
study (SD -809-C- 20 Baseline) . 
Double- Blind, Randomized Withdrawal Period Power and Sample Size:
It is estimated that approximately 91 subjects per arm will enable a power of at least 
90% to detect a beneficial effect of 1.4 points or more in the change from 
pre-withdrawal to post -withdrawal in centrally read AIMS when the SD -809 arm is 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 12compared to placebo, assuming a standard deviation of 2.9 and a 2 -sided type I error 
rate of 5%.
Analysis of the change in centrally read AIMS score during the Randomized 
Withdrawa l Period (from the P re-withdrawal Visit to the P ost-withdrawal V isit) will 
use an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the change in AIMS score as 
the dependent variable. The model will include randomized withdrawal treatment 
group, AIMS score at the Pre-withdrawal Visit, and DRA status at the P re-withdrawal 
Visit as fixed effects. The least squares means of the change in AIMS score will be 
compared between the SD -809 treatment and placebo groups using a 2 -sided test at 
the alpha=0.05 level of signifi cance. In addition, actual values and changes in AIMS 
score will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
The primary efficacy analysis will be tested at the α=0.05 level. If less than 135 
subjects are enrolled into the randomized withdrawal portion of the study, inferential 
statistics will not be provided as the study will be insufficiently powered to detect a 
treatment effect given the sample size assumptions.

CONFIDENTIAL 351. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Disease Back ground
Tardive d yskinesia (TD) is a serious delay ed-onset hy perkinetic movement disorder that appears 
as a complication of prolonged use of dopamine receptor antagonists (DRAs) including 
antipsy chotic agents (neuroleptics) and the prokinetic agent, metoclopramide . The clinical 
manifestations of TD include chorea, athetosis, d ystonia, akathisia, stereot yped behaviors and 
occasionally, tremor. Although earl y identification of TD in younger outpatients can be 
associated with higher rates of recovery  (50% to 90%; [Tarsy , 1983; Tarsy & Baldessarini, 
1984]), TD is often irreversible, and can be significan tly disabling and distressing to both 
patients and their famil y members and caregivers. 
Although the pathoph ysiology  of TD is not full y understood, the prevailing theory  centers 
around the concept of dopamine- receptor h ypersensitivity  (Teo, Edwards, & Bhatia, 2012). 
Based on this theory , the chronic use of dopamine antagonists results in a gradual 
hypersensitization of dopamine receptors, leading to the clinical features of TD. Supporting this 
concept is the observation that increasing the dos e of an antips ychotic drug temporaril y 
suppresses the s ymptoms of TD, while withdrawing the antipsy chotic or administering a 
dopamine agonist exacerbates the d yskinesia in the short term. In addition, the imbalance 
between D1 and D2 receptor -mediated effec ts in the basal ganglia has also been considered to be 
a contributing factor (Gerlach & Hansen, 1992; Trugman, 1998 ). The first -generation (t ypical) 
antipsy chotics (i.e., haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, etc.), which are causall y 
associated with TD, are potent inhibitors of the D2 receptors, resulting in excessive D1 -mediated 
effects and high frequencies of ex trapy ramidal s yndromes. Additionally , the development of TD 
has also been attributed to the possible destruction of striatal interneurons from excitotoxicity  
and oxidative stress, or more specifically , to the loss of the subpopulation of striatal GABAergic
interneurons 
(Teo, et al., 2012).
The prevalence of TD can be difficult to establish, as the antipsy chotic medications are known to 
cause, as well as mask, the sy mptoms of TD due to their hy pokinetic effects (Tardive Dy skinesia 
Task Force, 1980; Tarsy & Baldessarini, 2006) . Thus, prevalence rates in TD are frequently  
underestimated (Tarsy & Baldessarini, 2006 ). Nevertheless, the risk is substantial among patients 
exposed to DRBAs with rates ranging from 16% to 43% according to several studies reported 
between 1996 and 2002 ( Tarsy & Baldessarini, 2006) . The severity  of TD often varies with 
behavioral and emotional arousal, and differences in population age, gender, treatment duration, 
and ty pe and dose of antipsy chotic medication can further confound the diagnosi s (Kane, 2004; 
Lohr, 2008 ). Among outpatient schizophrenia patients treated with DRBAs, the prevalenc e of 
tardive s yndromes is also high, and has been estimated to be 30% (American Psy chiatric 
Association., 2000; Chouinar d, Annable, Ross -Chouinard, & Mercier, 1988; Correll, Rummel-
Kluge, Corves, Kane, & Leucht, 2009) . 
With the advent of the second- generation (at ypical) antipsy chotics (i.e., aripiprazole, clozapine, 
olanzapine, respiradone, quetiapine, a nd ziprasidone), which carry  a lower risk for 
extrapy
ramidal sy ndromes, it has been suggested that the prevalence of TD should decline over 
time. However, a meta -analy sis by  Leucht and colleagues of 31 controlled studies comparing 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 36older neuroleptics to new er, at ypical agents found that only clozapine was associated with a 
significantl y lower risk of acute extrapy ramidal s yndromes (Leucht, Wahlbeck, Hamann, & 
Kissling, 2003) . Additionally , recent trials, including the Clinical Antips ychotic Trials of 
Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) and the Cost Utility  of the Latest Antipsy chotic Drugs in 
Schizophrenia Study  (CUTLASS1), have not found significant differences in Abnormal 
Involuntary  Movement Scale (AIMS) scores between patients taking first -or second -generation 
antipsy chotics ( Lieberman, 2005; Jones, 2006).
There are currently  no approved medical therapies for the treatment of TD. Prevention and earl y 
detection are critical in the management of this disorder. Avoidance of treatment with 
antipsy chotic medicati ons and metoclopramide is the only  definitive method of prevention. 
However, avoidance of antipsy chotic therapies in patients with schizophrenia and other chronic 
psychoses is often not feasible. Evidence to support the withdrawal of, or switch from a t ypical 
to aty pical DRBA in a patient who develops TD is limited at this time and must be weighed 
carefully  against the risk of disease relapse and/or worsening of ps ychotic symptoms 
(Bhiday asiri et al., 2013 ). 
Numerous pharmacologic therapies for TD have been evaluated, but few have shown more than 
modest clinical benefits in practice. Acco rding to recent evidence
-based recommendations from 
the American Academ y of Neurology  (Bhiday asiri, et al., 2013) , data do not support the use of 
diltiazem, galantamine, or eicosapentaenoic acid as treatments for TD. In addition, data are 
insufficient to either support or refute the use of several other agents previously  studied in TD, 
including acetazolamide, bromocriptine, baclofen, vitamins/antioxidants (vitamins E, B6 , 
thiamine, melatonin, or selegiline), most first or second -generation antipsychotic medications, 
levetiracetam, buspirone, and nifedipine. At the present time, only  clonazepam, ginkgo biloba, 
amantadine, and tetrabenazine may be considered as treatment options for TD based on available 
data. As such, the medical need for developing safe and effective novel therapies in TD remains 
high. 
1.2. Tetrabenazine
Tetrabenazine is approved in the United States (US), Canada and several European Union (EU) 
countries as a therapy  for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease (HD). 
Tetrabenazine has also been used for several decades for the treatment of a variet y of other 
hyperkinetic movement disorders including TD (Jankovic & Clarence -Smith, 2011 ;Kenney , 
Hunter, & Jankovic, 2007) . In a single -
blind study  evaluating the efficacy  and safet y of 
tetrabenazine using a randomized videotape protocol pre- and post -treatment, significant 
reductions were observed post -treatment (mean dose 57.9 mg/d) in both the patient AIMS self 
rating and the AIMS motor subset evaluated b y blinded videotape reviewers (Ondo, Hanna, & 
Jankovic, 1999) . The patient AIMS self -rating scores improved 60.4% from a mean of 9.1 to 
3.6(p<0.001), while the AI MS motor subset scores improved 54.2% from 17.9 to 8.2 (p<0.001). 
In this stud y, tetrabenazine was well tolerated and all patients continued to the drug p ost-study . 
Overall, data on the treatment of TD with tetrabenazine in more than 400 patients have been 
reported across published studies ( Jankovic & Clarence- Smith, 2011 ). On the basis of this 
clinical experience, several treatment algorithms have reported that tetrabenazine is effective for 
the treatment of TD, including the American Academy  of Neurology  evidence- based guidelines 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 37in 2013 indicatin g that tetrabenazine may  be considered in the treatment of tardive dy skinesia 
syndromes (Bhiday asiri, et al., 2013 ).
Tetrabenazine is rapidly  and extensively  converted i n the liver by  carbon yl reductase to alpha -
dihydrotetrabenazine (α -HTBZ) and beta -dihydrotetrabenazine (β -HTBZ). These metabolites are 
potent and selective inhibitors of vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) -2, resulting in 
reduced storage and release of presynaptic dopamine, and are responsible for mediating the in 
vivo efficacy  of orally  administered tetrabenazine.
Details on the previous experience with tetrabenazine can be found in the SD -809 I nvestigator’s 
Brochure (IB), which includes the tetrabenazi ne prescribing information for the treatment of 
chorea associated with HD.
1.2.1. Limitations of the Current Commercial Product
Tetrabenazine (Xenazine®, Nitoman®) is an immediate- release formulation. While generally  
effective in treating chorea of HD and other h yperkinetic movement disorders, tetrabenazine has 
limitations including:
High peak concentrations of the active metabolites. Clinical experience in patients, and Phase 
1 data in health y volunteers, indicate that important adverse events of tetrabenazine, such as 
somnolence, akathisia, and anxiety  are often associated with peak concentration after dosing. 
Short half -lives of the active metabolites and the attendant requirement to dose the immediate 
release formulation frequently . The rapid decline in plasma concentrations may  lead to loss 
of efficacy  at the end of the dosing interval. The fluctuation in plasma concentration, as 
indicated b y high peak concentrations and low trough concentrations, necessitates more 
frequent dosing. Therefore, man y patients must take tetrabenazine three times a day  due to 
the short half -lives of the active metabolites, α- HTBZ and β -HTBZ. A less frequent dosing 
schedule is preferred as it may  improve medication compliance. 
The active metabolites α -and β -HTBZ are either primarily  (α) or exclusively  (β) metabolized 
by cytochrome P 450 2D6 ( CYP2D6). Poly morphisms in the CYP2D6 gene necessitate 
genot yping to prevent poor metabolizers from significantly greater exposure to the active 
drug moiet y than extensive metabolizers. 
To address the limitations of tetrabenazine, Auspex has developed a de uterated form of 
tetrabenazine (referred to as deutetrabenazine or SD-809) which is eliminated more slowl y than 
tetrabenazine. As outlined in Section 1.4and the IB, SD -
809 has been shown to reduce plasma 
fluctuation and dosing frequency  and thus, has the potential to improve overall tolerability  
compared with tetrabenazine.
1.3. Deuterium
Deuterium (D) is a naturally -occurring, non -radioactive stable iso tope of hydrogen (H) which, 
due to the presence of a neutron, has twice the mass as H. Deuterium has a natural abundance of 
approximately  0.0156% of all H atoms (Baillie, 1981) . The adult male body  contains 
approximately  57% water ( Guyton, 1991) , the major source of H in the body  (Chang, 2007 ). A 
70kg male contains approximately  39,900 g of water of which 0.0156% or 6.22 g is D 2O, 
yielding a naturally
-occurring bod y content of 1.24 g of deuterium. 
Small molecule drugs have b een developed in which carbon (C)- H bonds have been replaced 
with C -D bonds ( Kushner, Baker, & Dunstall, 1999) . The increased mass of deuterium in the 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 38C-D bond in small molecule drugs requires more energy  for cleavage b y cytochrome P 450
(CYP 450) enzy mes as compared to the corresponding C -H bond, a phenomenon known as the 
Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (Baillie, 1981 ). Replacing H with D at a C -H bond in a 
molecule has the potential to attenuate its metabolism if that C -H bond is the site of rate -limiting 
cleavage b y a CYP isozyme. By  attenuating metabolism in this manner, area under the curve 
(AUC), maximum concentration (C max), and half -life may  all be inc reased relative to the 
non-deuterated molecule (Kushner, et al., 1999).
The presen ce of D in the C -
D bonds of small molecule drugs does not pose a unique safety  risk. 
The C -D bond is more stable than the C- H bond and as such, D is not readily  subject to exchange 
with H in H 2O or in other organic materials (Kushner, et al., 1999) . The shape and surface charge 
of small molecule drugs is defined b y the electron cloud of the component atoms. The surface 
charge and spatial characteristics of deuterated drugs are thought to be biologically  
indistinguishable from their non- deuterated forms (Di Costanzo, Moulin, Haertlein, Meilleur, & 
Christianson, 2007; Fisher & Helliwell, 2008 ). Asa consequence, deuterium- substituted small 
molecule drugs and their non -deuterated forms are not likely  to be ph ysiologically  different in 
their binding to macromolecular structures such as recepto rs, transporters, enzy mes, or ion 
channels. 
1.3.1. Clinical Experience with Deuterium
Anumber of studies in healthy  volunteers and patients have evaluated the effects of acute and 
long-term use of deuterated water (D 2O). Acute exposures of to up to 23% D replacement in 
plasma were tolerated without reported adverse events ( Blagojevic, Storr, & Allen, 1994) . In 
several metabolic labeling studies, healthy  subjects consumed daily  doses of up to 9.8g D in the 
form of D 2O for up to 4 to 9 weeks, treatments sufficient to maintain 1.0% to 2.0% D enrichment 
in body  water. No adverse events were reported in these studies ( Collins, Eng, Hoh, & 
Hellerstein, 2003; Kassis & Jones, 2008 ;Leitch & Jones, 1993 ; Neese et al., 2002 ; Strawford, 
Antelo, Christiansen, & Hellerstein, 2004) . Deuterium ha s also been delivered to humans in the 
form of D -substituted glucose. Twent y
-five subjects with human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV) 
and 10 control subjects were infused intravenousl y over 48 hours with up to 200 g of [6,6 -d2]-
glucose, an amount which corres ponds to 4.4 g of deuterium. These infusions were not 
associated with adverse events ( Hellerstein et al., 2003). 
1.4. SD-809 (Deutetrabenazine)
SD-809 is a deuterated form of tetrabenazine in which the two O -linked methy l groups (CH 3) of 
the tetrabenazine molecule have been replaced b y two trideuterometh yl groups (CD 3). The 
conversion of SD -809 and tetrabenazine to their respective active metabolites, α -HTBZ and 
β-HTBZ, proceeds similarly  in human liver S9 fraction and in human liver microsomes. The CD 3 
groups in SD -809, which are conserved in α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ, attenua te the metabolism of 
these active metabolites by  CYP2D6 relative to the non -deuterated metabolites from 
tetrabenazine, leading to longer in vitro half-lives in human liver microsomes, human liver S9 
fraction, and in cells transfected with CYP2D6. These pharmacokinetic benefits have been 
confirmed in a clinical setting and enable less frequent dosing and reduced the plasma fluctuation 
of the active metabolites. Furthermore, the attenuated metabolism achieved through deuteration 
reduces the impact of CYP2D6 genot ype on exposure as compared to tetrabenazine with the 
potential to simplify  dosing.
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 39The safet y and pharmacokinetics of oral SD- 809 have been evaluated in five Phase 1 studies in 
healthy  adult volunteers. Additionally , two Phase 3 studies in adult patients with chorea 
associated with HD and one Phase 1b study  in adolescent patients with tics associated with 
Tourette s yndrome have been completed.
Single doses of SD -809 have been administered to 132 subjects at doses ranging from 7.5 to 
25mg, either alone or in conjunction with CYP2D6 inhibition. Multiple dose regimens of the 
tablet formulation have also been administered to 24 of those subjects f or up to 5 days (at doses 
up to 22.5 mg twice daily [BID] for 3 day s). 
For all studies, plasma concentrations of parent drug were low and sporadic because of the rapid 
and extensive hepatic metabolism of SD -809 to the active metabolites d 6-αHTBZ and 
d6-β-HTBZ. Peak plasma concentrations of the active moieties d 6-α-HTBZ and d 6-β-HTBZ were 
reached within 3 to 4 hours for the tablet formulation without a comparable loss of exposure. I n 
all studies where tetrabenazine was included as a control arm, deuteration was shown to 
significantl y prolong the half -lives of both α -and β -HTBZ, resulting in an increase in exposure 
(~130% increase) for both active metabolites at comparable doses. Based on the 
pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 7.5 to 22.5 mg SD- 809, it i s estimated that a 6 -mg dose of 
SD-809 will provide an exposure (AUC (inf)) comparable to 12.5 mg of tetrabenazine. Inhibition 
of CYP2D6 metabolism by  paroxetine administration led to a 3 -fold increase in bioavailability  of 
d6-(α+β) -HTBZ.
In the Phase 1 studies summarized above, no serious adverse events were reported and all 
adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity . Commonly  reported adverse events included 
headache, somnolence, nausea, dizziness and vessel puncture reaction.

-23, or any  other SD -809 study  for treatment of moderate to severe TD) will 
be enrolled. The study  will be conducted at approximately  80 centers in the U.S., Europe, and 
possibly  other regions. The study  is divided into 
different parts: Part A and Part B for all 
countries and an additional Part C for the EU countries. These parts include a Screening Period 
(Part A), a Titration Period (Part A), a Long -Term Treatment Period (Part A), a Double- Blind,
Randomized Withdrawal Period (Part B), treatment after completion of the Randomized 
Withdrawal Period (Part B), a continued treatment period (Part C), and a Post -Treatment Safety  
Follow -up Period (Part A , Part B, and Part C ).
3.1. Study Design
This is an open -label; single -arm stud y in which subjects with moderate to severe drug -induced 
TD who have successfully completed a parent study  will be invited to participate. Successful 
completion of a parent study  is defined as (1) study  participation through Week 13; (2) the 
subject has generall y been compliant with study  drug and procedures, in the opinion of the 
investigator; and (3) the subject has no ongoing adverse events that are serious (serious adverse 
events)c, 
severe in intensity, or expected to interfere with their participation in this study . 
Informed consent/assent (Part A )will be obtained before any  study  procedur es are performed. 
Subjects may  have informed consent/assent obtained up to 30 day s in advance of subject’s parent 
study  Week 13 Visit/TD -Long Term Safet y (LTS) Baseline Visit. Subjects who meet the 
selection criteria will be eligible to participate. 
Informed consent/assent for Part B will be obtained after Amendment 06 implementation and 
before an y stud y procedures related to Part B are performed. 
Informed consent/assent for Part C will be obtained after Amendment 07 implementation and 
before an y stud y procedures related to Part C are performed. Subjects who do not sign the 
informed consent /assent for Part C will complete the study  at Part B Follow -up Call . 
Subjects who have successfully  completed a parent study  may  be eligible to rollover directl y into
this study  after they  complete a 1- week washout period and the Week 13 evaluation of the parent 
study . To reduce subject burden, after obtaining informed consent/assent, some data collected in 
the parent stud y will be used in the SD -809-C
-20 study  and wil l provide some of the baseline 
data for SD -809-
C-20 (see Schedule of Events ). In addition to assessments completed for the 
parent stud y Week 13 visit, evaluations required as part of the SD -809-C-20 study  will be 
completed on the same day  as the Week 13 visit.

CONFIDENTIAL 42Part A:
Titration Period (up to 6 weeks): As all subjects will have discontinued study  drug (SD -809 or 
placebo) for 1 week at completion of the parent study , they  will undergo titration on SD -809 in 
this study . During titration, the I nvestigator, in consultation with the subject (and caregiver, if 
appropriate), will determine when an adequate level of dy skinesia control has been achieved. 
The dose of SD -809 should be adjusted (upward or downward) once per week, in increments of 
6mg per day , until there is adequate control of dyskinesia, the subject experiences a 
protocol -defined clinically  significant adverse event (defined as related to study  drug and either: 
a)moderate or severe in intensity  or b) meeting the c riteria for an serious adverse event), or the 
maximal allowable dose is reached. If a subject experiences a clinicall y significant adverse event 
attributable to SD -809, the Investigator will determine if a dose reduction, dose suspension, or 
withdrawal from the study  is necessary . Subjects will have a telephone contact at Week 1 and a 
clinic visit at Week 2 to evaluate safet y and establish a dose of stud y drug that adequately 
controls dy skinesia and is well tolerated. Although subjects will enter the Long -Term 
Treatment Period after Week 2, titration to optimize dose should occur through Week 6. 
Long -Term Treatment Period (Week 3 until the last dose in Part A) : During the Long- Term 
Treatment Period, subjects will continue titration through Week 6. During titration, all subjects 
will be contacted b y telephone at Week 3 (the first week of the Long -Term Treatment Period) 
and Week 5 and will return to the clinic at W eek 4 and Week 6 for evaluation of safet y and 
dyskinesia control. Subjects who have not achieved a stable dose b y the Week 6 visit may  have 
unscheduled visits or telephone contacts to further adjust their dose upward or downward. Site 
interactions for dose adjustment should alternate between telephone contacts and clinic visits. 
During the remainder of the L ong-Term Treatment Period, subjects will return to the clinic for 
evaluation of safet y and dyskinesia once every 13 weeks, starting at Week 15 and endin g at the 
last dose in Part A (completion of Part A= Week 158 or beginning of Part B after Amendment 06 
implementation). During long- term treatment, further dose adjustments of SD -809 may  be made, 
if necessary , but not more often than weekl y and in increment s of 6 mg per day . In the case of 
the addition of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (i.e., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and bupropion), a greater 
dose reduction may  be required. Dose reductions in this context should be reviewed with the 
Medical Monitor. Dose adjustments should be based on all available information, including the 
subject’s and caregiver’s reports of adverse events and dy skinesia control, information from 
rating scales, and all safety  evaluations. If warranted, study  sites are encouraged to conduct 
perio dic phone calls with the subjects to ensure adherence to the treatment regimen and retention 
of unused drug containers.
Subjects who have been on a stable dose of SD -809 and any  concomitant DRA for a minimum of 
4 weeks will be invited to participate in the Randomized Withdrawal Period (Part B) at the next 
routine visit at the site after approvals from IRB/Ethics Committee and as required by country  
regulations. If the subject chooses to participate in Part B, then participation in Part A will end.
Subjects 
who decline to participate in Part B will continue in Part A until Week 158. Subjects 
who decline participation in Part B will be given an ongoing option to participate at subsequent 
study  visits.
Part B:
Part B will consist of a double -blind ; randomized withdrawal period ;treatment with SD -809;and 
post-treatment safety  follow -up. The Randomized Withdrawal Period will be 1 week (+3 day s 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 43maximum) in duration and will consist of 2 visits, the P re-withdrawal V isit and the 
Post-withdrawal V isit. After the Randomized Withdrawal Period , the subjects will resume 
treatment with SD- 809 on the prior established dose for an additional 12 weeks until end of 
treatment ( EOT ).A follow -up telephone call will occur 4 weeks after EOT.
At the beginning of the Randomized Wit hdrawal Period, subjects will be randomized in a 
blinded fashion to either SD -809 (current dose) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio stratified by  concomitant 
DRA usage. Up to 194 subjects (active subjects as of the approval date of Amendment 06) will 
be randomized (SD-809 or placebo). Subjects will be required to sign a written informed 
consent. 
Subjects will need to be on a stable dose of SD -809 and any  concomitant DRA for a minimum of 
4 weeks before starting the Randomized Withdrawal Period. 
Subjects will be sch eduled to return 1 week (+3 day s maximum) after the Pre-withdrawal Visit 
of the Randomized Withdrawal Period for efficacy  and safet yassessments.
At the end of this period, subjects will continue treatment with SD -809 at the previous dose 
administered before the Randomized Withdrawal Period (last dose in Part A). Treatment with 
SD-809 will continue for 12 weeks until the EOT visit. 
Video ratings of the AIMS will occur at the Pre-withdrawal Visit , the Post -withdrawal Visit , and 
the EOT/earl y termination (ET) visit.
Part C :
For the EU countries, the study  will include a reduced burden safet y assessments period (Part C) 
of 52 weeks for subjects willing to continue in the study  and who have completed Part B.
Subjects will continue treatment with SD- 809 at the current dose administered during the 12-
week open -label period of Part B. Subjects will be scheduled to return every  13weeks ( ±1 week)
until EOT. A follow -up clinic visit will occur 1 week after ET and a follow -up telephone call 
will occur 4 weeks after EOT /ET.
Post-Treatment Safety Follow -up:
Part A :
Subjects who do not participate in Part B will continue in Part A, discontinue study  drug at the 
Week 158 visit , and return for their final clinic visit at Week 159 for evaluation of safet y, 
dyskinesia control, and motor function. During this 1 -week follow -upperiod, subjects should 
continue to not take prohibited concomitant medications. Subjects will also have a follow -up 
telephone contact at Week 162, 4 weeks after their last dose of study  drug , to evaluate adverse 
events and concomitant medication usage.
Subjects who discontinue study  drug in Part A will complete an ET visit; a follow -up clinic visit 
1week later to evaluate safet y, dyskinesia, and motor function; and a follow- up telephone 
contact 4 weeks after the last dose of study  drug to evaluate the adverse events and concomitant 
medication use since ET.
Part B :
Subjects who complete the Randomized Withdrawal Period and subsequent 12 weeks of 
treatment will complete an EOT visit and a follow- up telephone contact 4 weeks after the last 
dose of study  drug to evaluate the adverse events and concomitant medication use since EOT.
Subjects who discontinue study  drug in Part B will complete an ET visit; a follow -up clinic visit 
1week later to eval uate safet y, dyskinesia, and motor function; and a follow- up telephone 
contact 4 weeks after the last dose of study  drug to evaluate the adverse events and concomitant 
medication use since ET.
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 44Part C :
Subjects who complete the 52 weeks of reduced burden safety assessments period will comp lete 
a Part C EOT visit and a follow -up telephone contact 4 weeks after the last dose of study  drug to 
evaluate the adverse events and concomitant medication use since Part C EOT. Subjects who 
discontinue study  drug in Part C will complete an ET visit ,a follow -up clinic visit 1 week later 
for safety  evaluation, and a follow -up telephone contact 4 weeks after the last dose of study  drug 
to evaluate the adverse events and concomitant medication use since ET.
3.2. Rationale for Study Design
The study  is designed to evaluate the long -term safety  and tolerability  of SD -809 in subjects with 
moderate to severe d yskinesia associated with TD (Part A) and the persistence or maintenance of 
the therapeutic effect of SD- 809 in subjects with TD (Part B). Subjects who successfull y 
complete a placebo -controlled efficacy  study  (Study  SD-809-C- 18, Study  SD-809-C -23, or an y 
other controlled stud y of SD -809 as treatment for moderate to severe TD) will be eligible to 
enroll. An extension of the study  (Part C) with reduced burden safet y assessments is added to 
provide continued therapy  for subjects in the EU countries. Part C will be offered only  to 
subjects who completed Part B.
All subj ects will have discontinued study  drug (SD -809 or placebo) for at least 1 week and 
consequentl y will begin dosing at 6 mg BID and titrate to their optimal dose for up to 6 weeks. 
Although the time to reach an optimal dose will differ among subjects, it is expected that 
subjects will have reached a pharmacologicall y active dose by 2 weeks. Accordingl y, the 
long-term period of the study  will be deemed to have started after 2 weeks of treatment even 
though dose adjustment may  continue after this point.
The SD -809 dose should be adjusted to identify  a dose that reduces dy skinesia and is well 
tolerated. In addition to the assessments of d yskinesia control and tolerability  by the subject, 
caregiver, and stud y staff, 
safet y evaluations that target adverse events ob served in the drug class 
(e.g., akathisia) will be employ ed and considered in the dose -adjustment decision. In this 
manner, the dail y dose of study  drug for treating dy skinesia is determined individually  for each 
subject. Once adequate control of dyskinesi a has been achieved, the dose of study drug 
should not be increased further. In general, subjects will continue the dose established during 
titration into the long -term treatment period, but dose adjustments (upward or downward) are 
permitted so long as th ey do not occur more often than once per week.
The present investigation is an open -label safet y study with a nested, randomized, double -blind, 
1-week withdrawal period of SD-809. The stud y will enroll subjects with TD who were 
previously  exposed to either SD-809 or placebo in a parent study .
The US prescribing information for tetrabenazine indicates that CYP2D6 genoty ping should be 
performed at doses higher than 50 mg, although genoty ping is often not performed in clinical 
practice as the drug is titrated. In the present stud y, CYP2D6 genot yping will have been 
performed in a blinded manner in the parent stud y to allow evaluation of the effect of phenot ype 
on safet y parameters at the conclusion of the study.
3.3. Rationale for Dose Selection
As with tetrabenazine , SD-809 treatment will be individualized; therefore, fixed doses will not 
be evaluated in the study . The starting dose of 6 mg BID of SD -809 provides an AUC of total 
(α+β) -HTBZ that is comparable to a starting dose of 12.5 mg BID of tetrabenazine, but wit h a 
lower peak concentration and reduced plasma fluctuation. Although not approved for the

CONFIDENTIAL 45treatment of TD, there is a substantial body of clinical experience with tetrabenazine in this 
population. Table 1provides a summary  of 10 published reports describing the use of 
tetrabenazine in TD.

Treatment durations of over 5 years (Stacy , et al., 1993 )and dail y doses of up to 400 mg/day  
(Jankovic & Beach, 1997 ) have been reported with tetrabenazine. Starting doses varied across 
studies, but several authors reported initiating treatment at 12.5 mg BID and titrating based on 
symptom control and to lerability  (Jankovic & Beach, 1997 ; Ondo, et al., 1999 ; Paleacu, et al., 
2004) .In addition, a mean d ose of approximately  100 mg per day  was frequently  reported in 
these studies and was associated with a high response rate and an acceptable adverse event 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 47profile. The frequencies and ty pes of adverse events observed in the TD population have 
generall y been similar to those described in the HD population. 
Based on the available published literature for tetrabenazine, and the comparability  of 6 mg of 
SD-809 with 12.5 mg of tetrabenazine with regard to plasma AUCs, initiating treatment with 
SD-809 at 6 mg BID and titrating to a total dail y dose of 48 mg per day  (comparable in AUC to 
100mg of tetrabenazine) is considered to be appropriate for the present study . 
In the present stud y, the dose level of SD -809 treatment will be evaluated on a weekl y basis 
during the dose adjustment or Titration Period, based on assessments of dyskinesia control and 
adverse events, in order to determine if dose adjustment is needed. This approach is consistent 
with the tetrabenazine prescribing information for the treatment of chorea associated with HD. 
Weekly  dose adjustments for insufficient d yskinesia control should occur in increments of 6 -mg 
changes in the total dail y dose. Dose reductions greater than 6 mg should be reviewed with the 
Medical Monitor (see Section 5.2.4). 
In a population pharmacokinetics (PPK) anal ysis from 
Study  SD-809-
C-18 , for patients ≥100 kg 
with functional CYP2D6 status, 60 mg/day  given in 2 divid ed doses resulted in similar total 
(α+β) -HTBZ to that in healthy  subjects administered 24 mg BID. For lower body  weight patients 
(i.e., those <100 kg) with functional CYP2D6 status, a 48 mg/day  dose was identified as 
resulting in similar total (α+β)- HTBZ e xposure compared to healthy  subjects administered 24 mg 
BID. Based on these simulations, dosing in the current study  will be based on baseline bod y 
weight (<100 kg and ≥100 kg) and CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline (i.e., impaired 
[receiving a strong CY P2D6 inhibitor or is a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer] or not impaired) (see 
Appendix 13 for details).
For subjects with a bod y weight less than 100 kg, the maximum total daily  dose of SD -809 is 
48mg/day  (24 mg BID), unless the subject is receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., 
paroxetine; see Appendix 13), in which case th e maximum total daily  dose is 36 mg/day . For 
subjects with a body  weight of 100 kg or more, the maximum total daily  dose of SD -809 is 
60mg/day  (30 mg BID), unless the subject is on a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (paroxetine, 
fluoxetine, or bupropion), in which case the maximum daily  dose is 42 mg/day .

The study  drug to be used in this trial is a tablet formulation of SD -809. Five dosage strengths of 
SD-809 will be available for use: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 mg tablets. The actual dose of SD-809 
received by the subject will be determined b y the clinical pack supplied. The initial drug suppl y 
will be provided to the subject in the clinic at the Baseline visit.
5.1. Study Drug
5.1.1. SD-809
The study  drug is a matrix formulation in the form of a tablet to be administered with food.
Study  drug is coated with a poly mer coating to aid in swallowing. SD -809 tablets have been 
manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations.
During titration/dose adjustment in Part A , SD-809 tablets will be labeled according to

CONFIDENTIAL 52For subjects with bod y weight less than100 kg, the maximum total daily  dose of SD-809 is 
48mg/day  (24 mg BID), unless the subject is on a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (paroxetine, 
fluoxetine, or bupropion), in which case the maximum daily  dose is 36 mg/day . For subjects 
with body  weight 100 kg or more, the maximum total daily  dose of SD -809 is 60 mg/day  
(30mg BID), unless the subject is on a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (paroxetine, fluoxetine, or 
bupropion), in which case the maximum daily  dose is 42 mg/day .

*Body weight at the time of dose increase >48 mg/day
Daily  doses will be administered according to instructions provided in the Pharmacy  Manual .
During the titration period, the dose of SD-809 should be increased on a weekl y basis in 
increments of 6 mg of the total daily dose until:
oThere is adequate control of dyskinesia;
oThe subject experiences a protocol -defined clinically  significant adverse event 
(defined as related to study  drug and either a) moderate or severe in intensity  or 
b) meets the criteria for a serious adverse event); or 
oThe maximal allowable dose is reached. 
Study  drug will be titrated over the initial 6 weeks of therapy , if necessary , to identify  a dose 
that provides adequate dy skinesia control and is well tolerated. Changes in dose should not 
be made more often tha n once per week unless the subject is experiencing an intolerable 
adverse event.
If a subject experiences a clinically  significant adverse event attributable to SD -809, the 
Investigator will determine if a dose reduction or dose suspension, or withdrawal f rom the 
study  is necessary .
Once adequate control of dyskinesia has been achieved, the dose of study drug should not 
be increased further.
5.2.2. Dosing in Long -Term Treatment (Week 3 Until the Last Dose in Part A)
Initiall y during the Long -Term Treatment Period, a well -tolerated dose of SD -809 that provides 
adequate d yskinesia control may  not y et be established. Dose adjustments should continue 
during long -term treatment as specified in Section 5.2.1 . Once a stable dose is achieved, SD -809 
should be dosed at the same level throughout the remaining Long-Term Treatment Period. If 
necessary , however, the dose may  be adjusted further (upward or downward) to optimize 
dyskinesia control or minimize adverse events. In general, dose changes are limited to 6 mg of 
the total daily  dose (see Section 5.2.4). However, such changes in dose should not occur more 
frequentl y than once per week.
Once subjects are on a stable dose of SD -809, drug will be provided to study  subjects in 30- count 
bottles until the next specified visit. Each order will contain a sufficient supply  of study  drug 
until the next specified visit, plus overage to account for potential delay s in study  visits or 
evaluations or receipt of their supplies.

CONFIDENTIAL 535.2.3. Dosing in the Double -Blind, Randomized Withdrawal Pe riod
Subjects in the Randomized Withdrawal Period will continue to receive their current dose of 
SD-809 or will receive matching placebo. At the end of the Randomized Withdrawal Period, 
subjects will continue with, or return to, the same dose of SD -809 taken before the Randomized 
Withdrawal Period (last dose in Part A), beginning the day  after the Post-withdrawal V isit and 
continuing for 12 weeks. Subjects who do not return for the Post-withdrawal Visit within the 
10days (1week [+3 days maximum]) may  be required to undergo titration, as decided b y the 
Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor (if necessary ) per the guidelines in

of 12 -lead ECGs, the subject meets either of the following criteria:
a meanfQTcF value >500 msec or
a meangfchange in QTcF of >60 msec from Baseline
The reason for a dose reduction, suspension, or discontinuation must be clearly 
documented.
5.3. Treatment Administration
Each tablet should be swallowed whole with water and not broken, crushed, or chewed. Tablets 
should be taken with food and not be taken on an empty  stomach.
Subjects should be instructed to take the stud y drug w ith meals: tablets will be administered BID 
with meals in the morning and evening, as indicated on drug packaging. It is recommended that 
BID doses be taken approximately  10 hours apart during the day . A minimum of 6 hours should 
elapse between doses. If asubject misses a dose and it is within 6 hours of their next dose, the 
missed dose should be skipped. 
5.4. Accountability of Study Drug
The study  drug must be used in accordance with the protocol and onl y under the direction of the 
Investigator. All materials supplied are for use only  in this clinical study  and should not be used 
for an y other purpose.
The Investigator is responsible for study  drug accountability , reconciliation, and record 
maintenance at the investigational site. In accordance with all applic able regulatory  
requirements, the Investigator or designated site staff must maintain study drug accountability 
records throughout the course of the stud y. This person will document the amount of study  drug 
received, dispensed, and disposition of unused st udy drug.
A drug dispensing log must be kept current and will contain the following information:
The identification of the subject to whom the drug was dispensed;
The date(s) and quantit y of the drug dispensed to the subject.
Prior to the Pre -withdrawal Visit and Post -withdrawal Visit , the I nvestigator or designated site 
staff must place a call to remind the subject to bring all remaining stud y drugs to the visit. The 
Investigator or designated site staff must collect the study  drug(s) from the subject and conduct 
drug accountability . 
The inventory  must be available for inspection by  the Sponsor and/or study  monitor during the 
study . Drug supplies, including partiall y used or empty  containers, will be fully  accounted for at 
the end of the stud y by the stu dy monitor. Records of final disposition of the study  drug shall be 
maintained by  the Investigator. These records must show the identification and quantity  of each 
unit disposed of, the method of destruction (taking into account the requirements of local l aw), 
and the person who disposed of the stud y drug. Such records must be submitted to the Sponsor. 
                                                
fMean value is calculated based on three 12 -lead ECGs interpreted in the central ECG laboratory (Section 6.7.1 ). 
Patients with a ventricular pacemaker will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor.
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 565.5. Study Drug Compliance
The Investigator or designated study  staff is responsible for monitoring the subject’s compliance 
with study  drug during the trial. Co mpliance will be assessed b y tablet count, i.e., evaluation of 
returned stud y drug blister cards/bottles (e.g., amount used/amount expected to be used in 
interval between visits) and must be reviewed at every  visit while the subject is still in clinic to 
determine if the subject is taking stud y drug as directed. 
Compliance will be evaluated b y calculating the number of tablets used (tablets dispensed minus 
tablets returned) divided by  the expected number of tablets to be used. A subject will be deemed 
compliant over the overall treatment period if the subject has taken 80% to 105% of the expected 
tablets of study  drug.

CONFIDENTIAL 576. STUDY METHODS AND PR OCEDURES
6.1. Screening Period
6.1.1. Prior Data from Subject’s Parent Study
See Schedule of Events for data to be imported from the parent study after informed 
consent/assent.
Subjects who have successfully  completed a parent study  may  be eligible to rollover directl y into 
this study  after they  complete a 1- week washout period and the Week 13 (visit window up to 
10days) evaluation of the parent study . To reduce subject burden, after obtaining informed 
consent/assent, some data collected in the parent study  will be used in the SD -809-
C-20 study  
and provide some of the baseline data for SD -809-
C-20 (see Schedule of Events). In addition to 
assessments completed for the parent study  Week 13 visit, evaluations required as part of the 
SD-809-C- 20 study  will be completed on the same day  as the Week 13 visit. All subjects 
participating in SD -809
-C-20 are expected to rollover to SD-809-C- 20 at the Week 13 visit of 
the parent stud y.
Baseline visit study  drug will be shipped after site’s approval to receive study  drug. See 
Operations Manual for further details.
6.1.2. Baseline Visit (Day 0)
See the Schedule of Events for a detailed summary of activities.
Subjects will return to the clinic on Day  0 to undergo baseline evaluation. Subjects who continue 
to meet selection criteria will be enro lled in the study . 
Prior to conduct of an y study -specific screening procedures, the Investigator or designee will 
explain to the subject (and caregiver, if applicable) the study procedures, including the risks 
involved and the fact that their participatio n is voluntary . If subject lacks the capacit y to provide 
informed consent, a legally  authorized representative must provide written informed consent and 
the subject must provide assent. Each subject (and caregiver, if applicable) will acknowledge 
receipt of this information by  signing and dating a current, Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC)-
approved written informed consent, or subject assent 
if an LAR is utilized, for their involvement in the study  in the presence of the Investigator, or 
designee, who will also sign and date the informed consent or assent.
The Baseline clinic visit will consist of the following:
Obtain or verify  informed consent or assent (for subjects who do not have a legall y 
authorized representative )
Update medical history  
Urine pregnancy test (women of child -bearing potential only )
AIMS
Video recording of AIMS (see Section 6.8.1)
12-lead ECG
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA©)
Modified Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (CDQ -24)
Baseline results will be assessed by  the Investigator or Sub
-Investigator, and subjects who 
meet eligibility  criteria will be enrolled into the study .
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 58Subjects wi ll be provided with 1 week of stud y drug
Week 1 telephone visit will be scheduled
6.2. Dose Adjustment/Titration Period 
All subjects will interact weekl y with the clinical site, either b y telephone contact or clinic visit, 
during the dose adjustment/titration period, to evaluate safety and establish a dose of stud y drug 
that adequatel y controls dyskinesia and is well tolerated. Safet y evaluations include laboratory 
testing, ECGs, monitoring for adverse events and rating scales for motor function, depression, 
cognitive function, akathisia, and somnolence. 
As all subjects will have discontinued study  drug (SD -809 or placebo) for 1 week after 
completion of the parent study , they  will undergo titration on SD -809 in this study . During 
titration, the I nvestigator, in consultation with the subject (and caregiver, if applicable), will 
determine when an adequate level of d yskinesia control has been achieved. The dose of SD-809 
should be adjusted on a weekl y basis (upward or downward), in increments of 6 mg of total dail y
dose, until there is adequate control of d yskinesia; the subject experiences a protocol- defined 
clinically  significant adverse event (defined as related to study  drug and either a) moderate or 
severe in intensity or b) meets the criteria for a serious adv erse event); or the maximal allowable 
dose is reached. If a subject experiences a clinically  significant adverse event attributable to 
SD-809, the Investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . Subjects 
will have a telephone co ntact at Week 1 and a clinic visit at Week 2 to evaluate safety  and 
establish a dose of stud y drug that adequately  controls dy skinesia and is well tolerated. Although 
subjects will enter the Long
-Term Treatment Period after Week 2, titration may  occur thro ugh 
Week 6 to optimize dose. 
Once adequate control of dyskinesia has been achieved, the dose of SD -809 should not be 
increased further.
If a subject experiences an adverse event that is attributed to study  drug, the I nvestigator will use 
his or her judgme nt to determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . Dose 
adjustments should be made based on all available information including the subject’s (and 
caregiver’s, if applicable) reports of adverse events and dy skinesia control, the clinical 
asses sment of safet y and efficacy b y the Investigator, and information from rating scales such as 
the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale 
(BARS), the HADS, the Columbia Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS), the Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the MoCA©. At the end of the dose adjustment/titration period, the 
subject’s dose will be established for the remainder of the Long -Term Treatment Period. 
6.2.1. Weeks 1 and 2
See the Schedule of Events for a detailed summary of activities.
Telephone contact will be scheduled at Week 1 and a clinic visit at Week 2 of the study  for 
evaluation of safet y and SD -809 dose.
The Week 1 (±1 day) telephone contact will include the following activities:
Assessment of adverse events, dy skinesia control (in consultation with the caregiver, if 
applicable), and concomitant medication use
Evaluation of study  drug dose and adjustment, if necessary
Re-order stud y drug

scales.
Re-order stud y drug (See Operations Manual for further details)
The next telephone co ntact will be scheduled/reconfirmed.
6.3. Long -Term Treatment Period (Week 3 Until the Last Dose in Part 
A)
All subjects will enter the L ong-
Term Treatment Period after Week 2, although dose adjustment 
should continue through Week 6. During titration, all subjects will be contacted b y telephone at 
Weeks 3 and 5 and will return to the clinic at Weeks 4 and 6 for evaluation of safet y and 
dyskinesia control and blood sampling for safet y labs (Week 6 onl y). Subjects who have not 
achieved a dose that adequately contr ols dyskinesia and is well tolerated by the Week 6 
clinic visit should have unscheduled visits or telephone contacts to further adjust their dose 
upward or downward. Site interactions for dose adjustment should alternate between telephone 
contacts and clin ic visits. 
During the remainder of the L ong-Term Treatment Period, subjects will return to the clinic for 
evaluation of safet y and dyskinesia once every 13 weeks, starting at Week 15 and ending at the 
last dose in Part A (completion of Part A= Week 158 or beginning of enter Part B after 
Amendment 06 implementation). Further dose adjustments of SD -809 may  be made, if 
necessary , but not more often than weekly  and in increments of 6 mg. Dose adjustments should 
be based on all available information, including t he subject’s (and caregiver’s, if applicable) 
reports of adverse events and dy skinesia control, information from rating scales, and all safet y 
evaluations. If warranted, study  sites are encouraged to conduct periodic phone calls with the 
subjects to ensure adherence to the treatment regimen and retention of unused drug containers.
At Weeks 28, 54, 106, and 158, subjects will undergo a more comprehensive evaluation, 
including ph ysical examination, complete neurological examination (Weeks 54, 106, and 158 
only), safet y labs, 12 -lead ECG, urine pregnancy  test for women of childbearing potential, and 
performance of all rating scales.

Subjects undergoing an increase in dose of their current antips ychotic treatment, switching to a 
new antips ychotic agent, or having an additional antipsychotic treatment added to their regimen 
will require additional ECG monitoring. In such cases, the Investigator should contact the 
Medical Monitor to review these procedures.
Subjects undergoing such a change in oral antipsy chotic treatment should have an 
unscheduled visit between 1 -2weeks thereafter. 
Subjects undergoing an increase in dose of a long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsy chotic, 
switching to an LAI treatment, or having an add itional L AI antips ychotic treatment added to 
their regimen should have an unscheduled visit within the following timeframe, based on the 
prescribed LAI antips ychotic:

o8-9 weeks: risperidone LA, haloperidol decanoate, olanz apine pamoate, 
Zuclopenthixol decanoate
o12-13 weeks: all other LAI antipsy chotics
On the morning of the clinic visit, the subject should hold their SD- 809 dose until they  are in the 
clinic. Upon reaching the clinic, the following activities should be perfo rmed:
Administer the morning dose of SD
-809 with a meal or light snack
Collect a 12 -lead ECG 3 hours after SD -809 administration following at least 5 minutes of 
rest in a supine or semi -recumbent position.
oBased on the ECG machine reading, if QTcF value is >500 msec or there is a change 
from Baseline in QTcF value of >60 msec, two additional 12- lead ECGs should be 
collected as soon as practical. There should be at least 5 minutes between ECGs.

6.8. Efficacy and Quality of Life Measure s
6.8.1. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
The AIMS is an assessment tool used to detect and follow the severit y of TD over time. The 
AIMS was originally  developed by  a consortium of clinical ps ychopharmacology researchers 
funded b y the National Institute of Me ntal Health’s (NIMH) Psy chopharmacology  Research 
Branch ( Guy, 1976 ). While the original AIMS is widely  used and accepted in clinical practice, 
the scale does not include detailed descriptors, and thus, can be difficult to impl ement in a 
clinical trial setting. Over the y ears, a number of authors have developed modifications and 
scoring conventions to help clinicians assess abnormal movements with the AI MS in a more 
uniform manner ( Lane, 1985; Munetz and Benjamin, 1988).
For the present stud y, Auspex has proposed the use of AIMS descriptors ( Appendix 2),which 
are consistent with those utilized in large trials in schizophrenia, and were developed based on 
the work of Munetz and Benjamin ( Munetz and Benjamin, 19 88). These descriptors have face 
validity  in describing the severit y of abnormal movements in TD and have been reviewed with 
key scientific experts in movement disorders and psy chiatry , who uniformly  agreed that they  are 
appropriate for providing guidance to Investigators in grading the severit y of TD in this study . 
The AIMS is composed of 12 clinician -administered and - scored items ( Appendix 2). Items 1 to 
10 are rated on a 5 -point anchored scale and consist of the following:
Items 1 -4 assess orofacial movements
Items 5 -7 deal with extremity  and truncal dy skinesia
Items 8 -10 deal with global severit y as judged b y the examiner, and the patient’s awarene ss 
of the movements and the distress associated with them
Items 11 through 12 are yes/no questions concerning problems associated with teeth and/or 
dentures, as such problems can be mistaken for dy skinesia.
A total score from items 1 to 7 (orofacial, extre mity, and truncal movements) can be calculated 
and represent observed movements, with higher scores indicative of more severe d yskinesia. 
Item 8 can be used as an overall severity  index; items 9 and 10 provide additional information 
with regard to patient incapacitation and awareness; and items 11 and 12 provide information 
that may  be useful in determining lip, jaw, and tongue movements (Guy, 200 0
).
6.8.2. Independent Rating of Dyskinesia
To enable a s ystematic evaluation of the primary  endpoint, the AIMS will be digitall y 
video-recorded using a standard protocol at Baseline and at Weeks 6, 15, 28, 41, 54, and 158 
(seeAppendix 2
). 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 67The videos from Baseline and Weeks 6, 15, 28, 41, 54, 106, and 158 will be independentl y 
reviewed b y a blinded central rater(s) who is a n expert in movement disorders. 
This process will allow for a s ystematic assessment of dy skinesia that is not influenced by  
subject reports of tolerability  or efficacy . Videos will be recorded and submitted to the central 
rater in a blinded manner with respect to visit number, site, and date of recording. A detailed 
video protocol will be included in the study operations manual. A detailed video review charter 
will be established to ensure appropriate blinding and review procedures by the central video 
raters.
6.8.3. Clinical Global Impression of Change
The CGI C (Appendix 3) is a single -item questionnaire that asks the investigator to assess a 
subject’s TD s ymptoms at specific visits after initiating therap y. The CG IC uses a 7- point L ikert 
Scale, ranging from very  much worse (
–3) to very  much improved (+3), to assess overall 
response to therap y. 
6.8.4. Patient Global Impression of Change
The PGI C (Appendix 4) is single -item questionnaire that asks the patient to assess their TD 
symptoms at specific visits after initiating therapy . The PGI C uses a 7- point L ikert Scale, 
ranging from very  much worse (
–3) to very  much improved (+3), to assess overall response to 
therap y. In general, patient -rated global measures of change have face validity  and have been 
shown to correlate with disability for a number of chronic conditions (Kamper, Maher, & 
Mackay , 2009) .
6.8.5.
Modified Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire
The CDQ -24 is a disease -specific quality  of life questionnaire developed for use in patients with 
craniocervical dy stonia, including both cervical dystonia (CD) and blepharospasm (BPS) 
(Muller et al, 2004). The CDQ -24 was sele cted for use in the present study  because it includes 
domains which are relevant not only  to CD and BPS, but to TD. The following domains are 
evaluated in the CDQ -24: stigma, emotional well -being, pain, activities of daily  living, and 
social/family  life. For the present study , the CDQ -24 has been modified ( Appendix 5) such that 
the questions focus directly  on the impact of TD (as opposed to CD/BPS) on quality  of life. 
6.9. Safety Evaluations
6.9.1. Demographics and Medical History
The subject’s gender, year of birth, age, race, ethnic origin, and medical and surgical history  will 
be transferred from data collected in the parent study. The subject’s medical and surg ical history

Cranial nerves 
Motor sy stem (strength, tone posture) 
CoordinationGait and balance 
Tendon reflexes 
Sensation
6.9.4. Vital Signs
Vital signs to be assessed should include resting blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory  rate, and 
temperature. Heart rate and blood pressure measurements should be taken only  after a subject 
has rested quietl y in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes . 
6.9.5. Orthostatic Blood Pressure and Pulse
Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse will be recorded at Weeks 6, 54, 106, 158/ET, the 
Pre-withdrawal Visit , and EOT.
Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse will be assessed in the supine and standing positions. The 
subject should be supine for at least 5 minutes before the supine blood pressure and pulse are 
measured. Subjects will then move to the sitting position briefly  to ensure that no sy mptoms 
occur, after which they  will stand for 3 minutes. Standing blood press ure and pulse will be 
obtained after the subject has been in the standing position for at least 3 minutes.
6.9.6. Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples will be collected and tested for the items in Table 5and applicable 
parameters will be calculated according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) at the 
central laboratory . If abnormal, screening labs may  be repeated once to confirm the subject’s 
eligibility . As specified in Table 5, certain lab results obtained in the parent study  do not need to 
be repeated at screening for Study  SD-809-C

6.9.7. 12 -lead Electrocardiogram
All ECGs will be performed after at least 5 minutes rest in a supine or semi -recumbent position. 
12-lead ECGs to assess safet y will be collected according to the Schedule of Events. Heart rate 
and ECG intervals (PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF) and clinical interpretation will be assessed b y the 
central reader.
6.9.8. Detecting Adverse Events
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by  non-leading questioning of the subject and 
caregiver during the study  and may  also be identified when the subject and/or caregiver 
spontaneously  volunteered them. Open -ended, non -leading questioning of the subject is the 
preferred method to detect adverse events. 
Suitable non
-leading questions include: 
“How are you feeling?” 
“How have you been doing since your last evaluation?”
“Have you taken an y new medicines since your last evaluation? If so, why ?”
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 70Adverse events may  also be detected by  the medical staff through ph ysical examination, 
evaluation of la boratory  tests results, or other assessments. All adverse events occurring from 
signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) to the end of the stud y, regardless of suspected 
causal relationship to study  drug, will be recorded in the source documentation and on the 
appropriate electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) page for subjects who are enrolled. 
6.9.9. Rating Scales
Subject -completed assessments will be available in English, Spanish, Hungarian, German, 
Polish, Czech, and Slovakian.
6.9.9.1. Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale Part III – Motor Examination
The UPDRS ( Appendix 6) is a comprehensive instrument used to assess the signs and s ymptoms 
of Parkinson's disease. Th e UPDRS is comprised of various patient -and clinician -based 
assessments of motor, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms. UPDRS questions pertaining to 
motor function will be used to screen and monitor study  subjects for Parkinsonism.
6.9.9.2. Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale
The BARS ( Appendix 7) is a widely  used rating scale for evaluation of drug -induced akathisia. 
This scale includes an objective assessment, subject ive measures, including self
-awareness and 
distress, and a global clinical assessment (Barnes, 1989)
. 
6.9.9.3. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
The HADS ( Appendix 8) is a self -administered instrument reliable for detecting states of 
depression and anxiety  in an outpatient medical setting (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) . The HADS is 
recommended b y the National I nstitute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) Common 
Data Elements for HD because it serves as a good screening measure, it has been widel y used 
and it is relatively  simple to comple te. It focuses on subjective disturbances of mood rather than 
physical signs, and aims at distinguishing depression from anxiety .The scale consists of 14 items 
(7 each for anxiety and depression). Each item is rated on a 4 -point scale ranging from 0 (not 
at 
all) to 3 (very  often). Responses are based on the relative frequency  of sy mptoms over the 
preceding week.
6.9.9.4. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C -SSRS ( Appendix 9and Appendix 10) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) –
endorsed questionnaire to screen for suicidalit y in trials of central nervou s system (CNS) –active 
compounds ( The Columbia Suicide Severity  Rating Scale ; Guidance for Industry Suicidality: 
Prospective Assessment of Occurrence in Clinical Trials, DRAFT GUIDANCE , September 
2010) . The C -SSRS is an intervi ew b y trained study personnel that should be done at Baseline 
and during the study  as outlined in the Schedule of Events
. The form provided at Screening 
collects the history  of suicide (C -SSRS form version termed “baseline” ( Appendix 9) and at 
subsequent visits uses a C-SSRS termed “Since the Last Visit” ( Appendix 10).
6.9.9.5. Epworth Sleepiness Scale
The ESS ( Appendix 12) is a self -administered questionnaire compo sed of eight questions that 
provides a measure of a subject’s general level of day time sleepiness (Johns, 1991) . The ESS 
asks respondents to rate, on a 4- point L ikert scale (0 –3), their usual chances of dozing off or 
falling asleep in different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 71lives. The total ESS score is the sum of 8 item -scores and can range between 0 and 24 with a 
higher score indicating a higher level of daytime sleepiness. Most people can complete the ESS, 
without assistance, in 2 or 3 minutes.
6.9.9.6. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA©)
The MoCA©(Appendix 11) is a validated rapid screening instrument for assessing mild 
cognitive d ysfunction. I t assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, 
executive functions, memory , language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, 
calculations, and orientation. Time to administer the MoCA©is approximately  10minutes. The 
total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal.
6.10. Pharmacok inetic Evaluations
Subjects experiencing a serious adverse event should have a single blood sample collected as 
soon as possible after the serious adverse event and within 48 hours of the last dose of study  drug 
for the pharmac okinetic assessment of α- and β -HTBZ, if possible. The date and time of the last 
dose of study  drug should be recorded along with the date and time of the sample collection.
Subjects who have not achieved adequate control of dyskinesia during the study  may have up to 
two blood samples collected for future pharmacokinetic assessment of α
-and β -HTBZ. The 
pharmacokinetic sampling for inadequate efficacy  must be pre -approved b y the Medical 
Monitor. The date and time of the last dose of study  drug should be r ecorded along with the date 
and time of the sample collection.
6.11. Subject Restrictions

Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 72The drugs listed above and other drugs which are known to cause QT prolongation (see 
Appendix 14) should not be taken concomitantly  with study  drug. A washout period of 
5half-lives before the Baseline visit is required. A duration less than 5 half- lives must be 
approved b y the Medical M onitor.
Allowed Concomitant Medications
Stable Dosing
Subjects receiving ps ychoactive medications (including, but not limited to, neuroleptics [see 
Appendix 16], benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and mood stabilizers) must be on a stable dose 
for ≥30 day s (oral medication) before Screening and in the opinion of the treating ps ychiatrist, no 
changes in drug or dose are expected in the next 3 months. After 3 months, changes in 
psychoactive medications are allowed if approved by  the Investigator. Any  changes in 
concomitant medications must be documented in the eCRF.
Antipsy chotics
Considering the potential of antipsy chotic drugs to prolong the QT interval, additional ECG 
monitoring is required if the I nvestigator 1) increases the dose of a patient’s current antips ychotic 
treatment, 2) switches the patient to a different antipsy chotic treatment, or 3) adds a new 
antipsy chotic treatment to the patient’s regimen . In such cases, subjects should have an 
unscheduled visit within 1-2 weeks for a change in oral antipsy chotic treatment, or have an 
unscheduled visit within 4-5 weeks, 8 -9weeks, or 12-13 weeks (depending upon the prescribed 
LAI) for a change in their LAI antipsy chotic treatment, to have a repeat 12 -lead ECG following 
their usual SD- 809 dose (see Section 6.7.1 ). 
Antidepressants
Subjects receiving antidepressant therap y must be on a stable dose for 45 days before Screening. 
Subjects receiving long acting (depot) medications must have been on stable therap y (dose, 
frequency ) for ≥3 months before Screening. 
Other
Female subjects on hormonal contraception (approved oral, transdermal, or depot regimen) for 
birth control must be on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to Screening and through study  
completion.
Subjects will be instructed to inform the study  Investigator of the det ails (indication, dose, and 
dates of administration) if they  do take any  medication, and these details will be recorded in the 
eCRF. 
6.11.2. Use of Alcohol or Sedating Drugs
As with other VMAT2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, reserpine), subjects should be advised tha t the 
concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs with SD -809 may  have additive effects and 
cause or worsen somnolence. Until subjects are receiving a stable dose of SD -809 and 
understand how the drug affects them, alcohol should be used with caution. 
6.11.3. Other Restrictions
Subjects should be advised to not drive a car or operate dangerous machinery  until they  
understand how SD -809 affects them.
Use of illicit drugs is prohibited from the time of signing of the Informed Consent Form or 
Assent and throug hout study  participation.
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 736.12. Caregiver Responsibilities
The Investigator will assess whether the subject lives in a stable environment and has adequate 
supervision when necessary  to safel y participate in the trial. For those subjects needing the 
assistance of a caregiver, the caregiver must interact on a regular basis with the subject and 
oversee stud y drug administration. I n addition, the caregiver will assure attendance at study  visits 
and participate in evaluations, as required. 
The caregiver must also make him/herself available for clinic visits and telephone contacts in 
order to report d yskinesia control and adverse events to determine whether dose adjustment of 
study  drug will be made. As subjects may  have agnosia to dy skinesia, telephone contacts should
involve the subject and caregiver, when appropriate.
6.13. Withdrawal Criteria
Subjects will be advised that they  are free to withdraw from the study  at any  time for any  reason. 
A subject may  be withdrawn from the stud y for any of the following reasons:
Subject voluntarily  discontinues study  participation (subject withdrawal);
The need to take medication which may  interfere with study  measurements;
Intolerable/unacceptable adverse events (see Section 5.2.4 for QTcF discontinuation criteria);
Major violation or deviation of study  protocol procedures;
Non-compliance of subject with protocol;
Subject is unable to comply  with study  procedures;
Withdrawal from the study  is, in the Investigator’s judgment, in the subject’s best interest;
Subject is lost to follow -up;
A female subject becomes pregnant;
Study  termination by  the Sponsor.
All subjects to be withdrawn from the stud y for medical reasons should be revie wed with the 
Medical Monitor. The reasons for withdrawal will be recorded on the eCRF and included in the 
final report along with any adverse events and an y necessary  medical treatment. 
6.14. Discontinued Subjects
Notification of early  subject discontinuation f rom the study  and the reason for discontinuation 
will be made to the Clinical Monitor and will be clearl y documented on the appropriate eCRF 
page. If a subject is discontinued from the study  early , all ET evaluations should be performed at 
the time of disc ontinuation, if possible. 
6.15. Study Termination
The study  may  be stopped at any  time by  the Sponsor, IEC/I RB, and/or regulatory  agencies for 
any reason. The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the trial at any  time for an y reason. 
Reasons will be provided in the event of this happening. The Investigator reserves the right to 
discontinue the study  at their site for safet y reasons at any time in collaboration with the 
Sponsor.
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 747. ADVERSE EVENTS
Throughout the course of the study, all adverse events will be monitored and reported on an 
adverse event CRF, including assessments of seriousness, severit y, action taken, and relationship 
to study  drug. If adverse events occur, the first concern will be the safet y of the study 
participants. 
Adverse events will be rec orded from the time of consent through the final study  visit. 
Information about side effects alread y known about the study  drug can be found in the IB and 
will be included in the subject I CF.
The Investigator and site staff are responsible for detection, recording and reporting of events 
that meet the criteria and definition of an adverse event or serious adverse event (listed below).
7.1. Definitions
7.1.1. Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) therefore, can be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a drug, without any  
judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from an y use of the drug (e.g., off -label 
use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or 
dose, including an overdose.
Examples of an adv erse event include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre- existing condition including either an increase 
in frequency
 and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y drug administration even though it may  
have b een present prior to the start of the study .
Abnormal safety  assessments if they  lead to study  drug dose modification, study  drug 
discontinuation or to therapeutic intervention (e.g., low hemoglobin that requires 
transfusions).
Abnormal laboratory  tests if they are associated with clinical signs, sy mptoms or if they  lead 
to a diagnosis or therapeutic intervention.
Abnormal vital signs if they  are clinicall y significant and lead to a diagnosis or therapeutic 
intervention. 
Abnormal ECGs if they  are clinicall y significant and lead to therapeutic intervention or 
diagnosis. The clinical significance should be confirmed b y a cardiologist.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  drug 
product or a concurrent medication.
Examples of an adverse event do not include:
A medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y); a condition that leads to the procedure is 
an adverse event.
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 75Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to hospital) or scheduled elective procedures like cosmetic surgery  are not adverse 
events. However, if the procedure results in an unexpected complication, the complication is 
an adverse event.
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur or when signs are not 
expressing a medical problem but rather are expressing natural phy siological responses (e.g., 
dyspnea after running, limb paresthesias due to awkward position).
Signs, sy mptoms, or laboratory  results that reflect an improvement of a past medical 
condition (e.g., sl eeping better).
7.1.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction
A suspected adverse reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of safet y reporting, reasonable possibility  
means there is evi dence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. 
A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certaint y about causality  than adverse 
reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.
7.1.3. Adverse Reaction
An adve rse reaction means an adverse event that is caused by  a drug. Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug 
caused the event.
7.1.4. Unexpected Adverse Event
An adverse event or suspected adv erse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the 
IB or is not listed at the specificit y or severit y that has been observed. For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by  virtue of greater severity ) if the IB referred 
only to elevated hepatic enzy mes or hepatitis. Similarly , cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (b y virtue of greater specificity ) if the IB listed only  cerebral 
vascular accidents. “Unexpected”, as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or 
suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specificall y mentioned 
as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Event
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any  of the following outcomes:
Results in death (i.e., th e adverse event caused the death).
Is life -threatening. The term life threatening in the definition of serious refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe.
Requires inpatient overnight hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, 
unless hospitalization is for:
oElective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition and has not worsened 
since signing the informed consent
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 76oSocial reasons and/or respite care in the absence of an y deterioration of the subject’s 
general condition. 
oIn general , hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (involving at 
least an overnight stay  of at l east 24 hours) at the hospital or emergency  ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician's 
office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are 
adverse events. If a complication pr olongs hospitalization or fulfills any  other serious 
criteria, the event is serious. 
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity . The term disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life functions. Thi s definition is 
not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., 
sprained ankle) which may  interfere or prevent every day life fu nctions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect (i.e., an adverse finding in a child or fetus or a subject 
exposed to the study  drug prior to conception or during pregnancy ).
Is medicall y important, defined as a n event that may  jeopardize the subject or may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or result in 
urgent investigation. Examples of such events are malignancies, intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
If either the Sponsor or Investigator believes the event is serious, the event must be considered 
serio us and evaluated b y the Sponsor for expedited reporting.
7.2. Recording of Adverse Events
Whenever possible, a unify ing diagnosis should be recorded in the eCRF as the adverse event 
rather than individual signs or sy mptoms. Similarly , the unify ing diagnosis sho uld be recorded as 
the adverse event rather than the abnormal laboratory  result (i.e., “anemia” instead of “low 
hemoglobin”). 
If the adverse event is a worsening of a past medical condition, the adverse event should clearly  
indicate that the past medical condition has worsened using words such as “worsening,” 
“aggravated,” or “exacerbation.” 
7.2.1. Recording of Non- Serious Adverse Events
Collection of adverse events will begin immediately following signing of the I CF through the 
final study visit. The Investigat or will monitor each subject closel y and record all observed or 
volunteered adverse events. Adverse findings detected at the Screening visit (e.g., abnormalities 
on clinical laboratory  testing, ECGs, phy sical/neurological examination) will be recorded on t he 
Medical History  CRF and adverse events occurring after the Screening visit but before starting 
study  treatment will be recorded on the adverse event CRF and considered non -treatment 
emergent.
7.2.2. Recording of Serious Adverse Events
Collection of serious adverse event s will begin immediately  following signing of the I CF 
through the final study  visit. The I nvestigator will monitor each subject closely  and record all 
observed or volunteered serious adverse event s. Serious adverse events occurring after signing 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 77the ICF but before starting study  treatment will be considered non -treatment emergent.
If a new serious adverse event comes to the attention of the Investigator after the completion of 
the final study  visit, information regarding the serious adverse event should be collected and 
reported to the Sponsor only  if assessed as reasonably  possibly  related to the study  drug(s) by  the 
Investigator.
After the initial serious adverse event report, the Investigator is required to proactivel y follow 
each subject and provide further information to the Sponsor (or designee) on the subject’s 
condition. The Investigator will ensure that follow- up includes an y supplemental investigations 
as may  beindicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality  of the serious adverse event . This 
may include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
Serious adverse event s that remain ongoing past the subject’s last protocol- specified follow -up 
visit will be evaluated by the I nvestigator and Sponsor. All serious 
adverse event s will be 
followed:
Until resolution, or
For 28 days after the subject’s last follow -up visit, or
If, in the investigator’s opinion, the condition is unlikely  to resolve, whichever comes first. If 
the Investigator and Sponsor agree the subject’s condition is unlikely  to resolve, the 
Investigator and Sponsor will determine the follow- up requirement.
Subject s experiencing a serious adverse event should have a single blood sample collected as 
soon as possible after the serious adverse event and within 48 hours for the pharmacokinetics of 
α- and β- HTBZ , if possible . The date and time of the last dose of study d rug should be recorded 
along with the date and time of the sample collection.
7.3. Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non -Serious)
At each in- person visit and telephone contacts, occurrence of adverse events will be assessed by  
verball y asking subjects a nd caregivers if they  have had an y problems or symptoms since their 
last visit.
If the subject or caregiver reports an adverse event, the investigator/coordinator will probe 
further to determine:
Time of onset and resolution
Frequency
Causality /relation to study  treatment
Intensit y
Action taken regarding study  drug
Outcome
7.3.1. Severity
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each adverse event and serious adverse 
event reported during the study . The assessment will be based on the Investigator ’s clinical 
judgment. The intensit y of each adverse event and serious adverse event recorded in the eCRF 
should be assigned to one of the following categories:
Mild: Causes minimal discomfort, but does not interfere with normal daily activities
Moderate: Causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal daily activities
Severe: Prevents normal daily activities
An adverse event that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a serious adverse event. 
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 78Severity  is a category  utilized for rating the intensity  of an event; and both adverse events and 
serious adverse events can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as serious when it meets 
one of the pre -defined outcomes as described in Section 7.1.5.
7.3.2. Relationship to Study Drug
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y drug and the occurrence of 
each adverse event. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine if there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the adverse event . The investigator’s assessment of 
the relationship of each adverse event to study  drug will be recorded it in the source documents 
and the eCRF. Alternative causes, such as medical history , concomitant therap y, other risk 
factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study  drug should be considered and 
investigated, if appropriate. The Medical Monitor’s opinion may  be sought in those cases in 
which the Site I nvestigator is unable to make an independent judgment. The Medical Monitor 
may in turn consu lt with the Principal Investigator as needed. The following definitions are 
general guidelines onl y to help assign grade of attribution:
Unrelated: The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational drug
Unlikely: The adverse event is doubtful ly related to the investigational drug
Possible: The adverse event may be related to the investigational drug 
Probable: 
The adverse event is likely related to the investigational drug
Definite: The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational drug
7.3.3. Action Taken with Study Treatment
Action taken as a result of an adverse event will be recorded on the adverse event eCRF as 
follows:
No change
Dose reduced
Drug suspended (see Section 5.2.4 for guidance in contacting Medical Monitor)
Drug permanently  discontinued
7.3.4. Treatment Required
Treatment required as a result of an adverse event will be recorded in the subject’s sourc e 
documents, and if medication is required, on the concomitant medications log:
None
Medication Required (record on Concomitant Medications eCRF)
Hospitalization Required
Other (specify )
If a diagnosis has been entered as an adverse event, the treatment(s) recorded may  represent the 
treatment(s) given for one or more sign(s) or s ymptoms(s) (e.g., Naproxen for the adverse event 
“fracture”, without recording “pain due to fracture” or “inflammation due to fracture” as separate 
adverse events). 
7.3.5. Outcome
Outcome of an adverse event will be recorded on the adverse event eCRF as follows:
Recovered / Resolved 
Recovering / Resolving 
Recovered / Resolved with Sequelae
Auspex Pharmaceuticals, I nc. Protocol SD -809-C-20 Amendment 07
CONFIDENTIAL 79Not Recovered / Not Resolving 
Fatal
Unknown
7.4. Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events
All serious adverse events occurring during stud y participation must be reported to the Sponsor 
(or designee) and to the governing IRB/IEC as required by the IRB/IEC, local regulations, and 
thegoverning health authorities.
7.4.1. Completion and Transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report
Once an Investigator becomes aware that a serious adverse event has occurred in a stud y subject, 
she/he will report the information to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours. The serious 
adverse event form (provided in the study  Operations Manual) will alway s be completed as 
thoroughl y as possible with all available details of the event, signed b y the Investigator (or 
designee), and forwarded to the Sponsor (or designee) within the designated time frames. If the 
Investigator does not have all information regarding a serious adverse event, he/she will not wait 
to receive additional information before notify ing the Sponsor (or designee) of the event and 
completing the form. The form will be updated when additional information is received
Whenever possible, the Investigator will provide an assessment of causality at the time of the 
initial report as described above.
The Sponsor will provide a list of project contact s for serious adverse event receipt. An y event 
that in the opinion of the Investigator may  be of immediate or potential concern for the subject’s 
health or well -being will be reported to the Sponsor (or designee). 
7.4.2. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Ser ious Adverse Events
The Investigator must promptly  (within 24 hours of awareness) report all serious adverse events 
to the Sponsor (or designee) in accordance with the procedures describe above. Prompt 
notification of serious adverse events b y the Investig ator to the appropriate project contact for 
serious adverse event receipt is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities 
towards the safet y of other subjects are met. The Investigator will be responsible for reporting 
serious adverse e vents to the I RB/IEC per local regulatory  requirements. 
The Sponsor (or designee) is responsible for reporting serious adverse events to the relevant 
regulatory  authorities in accordance with local regulations. That is, serious adverse events which 
are de termined by  the Sponsor to be “Unexpected” and classified as “Suspected Adverse 
Reactions” will be reported in an expedited manner. 
7.5. Procedures for Reporting Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events
The Investigator must promptly  report all pregnancies in femal e stud y subjects to the Sponsor (or 
designee) in accordance with the Operations Manual. While the pregnancy itself is not 
considered to be an adverse event or serious adverse event, an y pregnancy  complications should 
be recorded as adverse events or seriou s adverse events. Any  pregnancy  will be followed through 
its conclusion for observation of any serious adverse events including congenital anomalies/birth 
defects.

Period (from the Pre-withdrawal V isit to the Post-withdrawal V isit) will use an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the change in AIMS score as the dependent 
variable. The model will include randomized withdrawal treatment group, AI MS score at the 
Pre-withdrawal Visit, and DRA status at the P re-withdrawal V isit as fixed effects. The least 
squares means of the change in AIMS score will be compared between the SD- 809 treatment and 
placebo groups using a 2 -sided test at the alpha=0.05 level of significance. In addition, actual 
values and changes in AIMS score will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
The primary  efficacy  analy sis will be tested at the α=0.05 level. If less than 135 subjects are 
enrolled into the randomized withdrawal portion of the study , inferential statistics will not be 
provided as the st udy will be insufficiently  powered to detect a treatment effect given the sample 
size assumptions.
8.7. Sample Size
Because this is an open -label safety  study , the sample size is not based on statistical 
considerations. 
During the Randomized Withdrawal Period in Part B , there will be up to 194subjects 
randomized (SD- 809 or placebo). It is estimated that approximately  91subjects per arm will 
enable a power of at least 90% to detect a beneficial effect of 1.4 points or more in the change

compared to placebo, assuming a standard deviation of 2.9 and a 2 -sided type I error rate of 5%.
Approximately  102 subjects may  enroll in Part C conducted in the EU countries.
8.8. Protocol Deviatio ns and Violations
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study  is conducted in accordance with the 
protocol. No modifications to the protocol, other than those that are deemed necessary  to protect 
the safet y, rights, or welfare of subjects b y the Investigator are to be made without prior, written 
approval b y the Sponsor. The nature and reasons for the protocol deviation will be recorded 
where appropriate and indicated. The Sponsor must be notified of all protocol 
deviations/violations. Signif icant protocol deviations/violations (e.g., inclusion/exclusion 
criteria) will be reported to the Sponsor and to the IRB/IEC in accordance with its reporting 
policy .
8.9. Data Recording
Source data will be transcribed onto source document worksheets and will then be entered into 
an eCRF. An Electronic Data Capture (EDC) s ystem with eCRFs will be used for this trial. 
Instructions for eCRF completion will be provided in a separate document. Source d
ata 
collection and entry  into the eCRF will be completed by  authorized study  site personnel 
designated b y the investigator. Appropriate training and securit y measures will be completed 
with the investigator and all authorized study  site personnel prior to the study  being initiated and 
before an y data is entered into the eCRF system for an y study subjects.
8.10. Data Quality Assurance
Steps to assure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified clinical 
Investigators and appropr iate study  sties, review of protocol procedures with the clinical 
Investigator and associated personnel prior to the study, and periodic monitoring visits by  the 
Sponsor. The Sponsor (or designee) will review data accuracy  and completeness during and after
the study , and any  discrepancies will be resolved with the clinical investigator or designee as 
appropriate.
8.11. Data Management
The data will be entered into a validated EDC s ystem that complies with Title 21 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations part 11, maintained by  the Sponsor or designee. The data management 
group will be responsible for data processing, in accordance with agreed procedures. The 
Principal I nvestigator will electronicall y sign and date the appropriate eCRF page when 
instructed to do so by  the study  CRA. This signature will indicate that the Principal Investigator 
inspected or reviewed the data in the database, the data queries, and the site notifications, and 
agrees with the content.

performed at doses higher than 50 mg, although 
genotyping is often not performed in clinical 
practice as the drug is titrated. In the present 
study, CYP2D6 genotyping will have been 
performed in a blinded manner in the previous 
study (SD -809-C-18) to allow  evaluation of the 
effect of phenotype on safety parameters at the

The SMC will determine the data necessary for 
monitoring and the intervals for formal review 
and discussion (e.g., after certain percentage of 
enrol led subjects complete treatment), and this 
information will be specified in the SMC charter.
The SMC will make recommendations to the 
Sponsor as to whether the trial should continue as 
planned or whether modifications should be 
made to safety monitoring. M inutes will be kept 
of all meetings but those referring to unblinded 
data w ill not be made available outside of the

Term  Treatment 
PeriodLong- Term Treatment Period (up to 52 weeks): 
During long -term treatm ent, subjects w ill continue
titration through Week 6. During this period, all 
subjects will be contacted by telephone at Week 3 (the 
first week of the Long -Term  Treatm ent Period) and 
Week 5 and w ill return to the clinic at Weeks 4, 6, 15, 
28, 41, and 54 for evaluation of safety and dy skinesia 
control. Subjects who have not achieved a dose level 
that adequately controls dyskinesia and is well 
tolerated by the Week 6 visit should have unscheduled 
visits or telephone contacts to further adjust their dose 
upward or dow nward. Interactions with the clinical 
site for dose adjustment should alternate betw een 
telephone contacts and clinic visits. During long -term 
treatment, further dose adjustments of SD -809 m ay be 
made, if necessary, but not more often than weekly 
and only in increments of 6 mg per day. Dose 
adjustments should be based on all available 
information, including the subject’s and caregiver’s (if 
appropriate) reports of AEs and dyskinesia control, as 
well as information from rating scales and safety 
evaluations, when available. Long-Term Treatment Period (up to 2 years): During 
long-term treatm ent, subjects will continue titration 
through Week 6. During titration, all subjects will be 
contacted by telephone at Week 3 (the first week of the 
Long -Term  Treatm ent Period) and Week 5 and will 
return to the clinic at Week 4 and Week 6 for evaluation 
of safety and dyskinesia control. Subjects who have not 
achieved a dose level that adequately controls dyskinesia 
and is well tolerated by the Week 6 visit should have 
unscheduled visits or tel ephone contacts to further adjust 
their dose upward or dow nward. Interactions with the 
clinical site for dose adjustment should alternate betw een 
telephone contacts and clinic visits. During the 
remainder of the Long -Term  Treatm ent Period, subjects 
will re turn to the clinic for evaluation of safety and 
dyskinesia once every 13 w eeks, starting at Week 15 and 
ending at Week 106 (i.e., after 2 years of Long -Term  
Treatment Period). During long -term treatment, further 
dose adjustments of SD -809 may be made, if n ecessary, 
but not more often than weekly and only in increments of 
6 mg per day. Dose adjustments should be based on all 
available information, including the subject’s and 
caregiver’s (if appropriate) reports of AEs and dyskinesia 
control, as w ell as infor mation from rating scales, and 
safety evaluations, when available. If w arranted, study 
sites are encouraged to conduct periodic phone calls w ith 
the subjects to ensure adherence to the treatment regimen 
and retention of unused drug containers.Extension of Long-

Dose reductions should generally occur in 
increments of 6 mg/day, except in the case of 
addition of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (i.e., 
paroxetine, fluoxetine, bupropion), in whic h 
case a greater dose reduction may be 
required. Dose reductions in this context 
should be review ed with the Medical

be made by requesting that the next lowest 
dose level be shipped directly to the subject.
Suspension of study drug for up to 1 w eek, if 
warranted, is allow ed. 
Suspensions of study drug for AEs must be 
reviewed with the Medical Monitor before 
therapy is restarted. If study drug is 
restarted after a suspension for an AE, a 
dose reduction of 6 m gor more is 
permitted .
Suspensions for m ore than 7 days must be

appropriate investigation and treatment. 
SD-809 m ay only  be restarted once serum 
potassium or magnesium have no rmalized.
Suspensions for more than 7 days must be

Antipsychotic Regimen
Subjects undergoing an increase in dose of 
their current antipsychotic treatment, 
switching to a new antipsychotic agent, or 
having an additional antipsychotic treatment 
added to their regimen will require addi tional 
ECG monitoring. In such cases, the 
Investigator should contact the Medical 
Monitor to review  these procedures.
• Subjects undergoing such a change 
in oral antipsychotic treatment should have 
an unscheduled visit between 1 -2 weeks 
thereafter. 
• Subjects undergoing an increase in 
dose of a long-acting injectable (LAI) 
antipsychotic, switching to LAI treatment, or 
having an additional LAI antipsychotic Given the potential for many 
antipsychotics to prolong the QT 
interval, additional ECG 
monitoring will be added if a 
patient increases antipsychotic 
dose, sw itches to a ne w 
antipsychotic, or has a new 
antipsychotic treatment added to 
their regimen.

On the morning of the clinic visit, the subject 
should hold their SD -809 dose until they are 
in the clinic. Upon reaching clinic, the 
following activities should be performed:
• Administer the morning dose of SD -
809 w ith a meal or light snack
• Collect a 12 -lead ECG 3 hours after

an unscheduled visit within 1 -2 weeks for a 
change in oral antipsychotic treatment, or 
have an unscheduled visit within 4 -5 weeks, 
8-9 weeks, or 12 -13 w eeks (depending upon 
the prescribed LAI) for a change in their LAI 
antipsychotic treatment, to have a repeat

Lay Summary of Proposed Research 
Lay Summary of Proposed ResearchRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel method for treating depression, in which a magnetic coil is used to stimulate specific regions of the brain. Although the approach has proven effective for some individuals with medication-resistant depression others do not benefit from the TMS approaches that are presently being used. One reason why some people respond well and others do not may have to do with individual variations in brain organization, which would require stimulation to be applied to slightly different locations in different individuals. The differences in brain organization can be detected using individualized functional MRI scans, which then allow the coil placement to be determined separately for each individual. The goal of this project is to guide rTMS using fMRI in individuals with depression who did not respond to standard TMS treatment to evaluate whether targeted TMS using individualized functional MRI scans produce outcome superior to that of conventional approaches. We will also scan MDD patients prescribed to receive standard TMS for the first time before and after which they will have resting-

state FMRI scan in order to see if we can predict their responsiveness based on the functional connectivity 
maps.  This protocol will recruit subjects from an ongoing study of rTMS treatment of depression being conducted by Dr. Tarique Perera who is a non-Columbia physician, and already approved by an independent IRB (WIRB protocol #20141643 entitled: “Cognitive Changes During Treatment with TMS for Major Depression”, see attachment). Group 1 are patients coming from Dr. Perera’s offices who will be scanned at the NYSPI MRI Unit pre/post TMS treatments. TMS treatments for this group will be implemented under Dr. Perera’s protocol and WIRB. We will only be doing scanning at the NYSPI. Group 2 are patients coming from Dr. Perera’s offices who will come to the NYSPI site to be scanned at the NYSPI MRI Unit pre/post TMS treatments and to receive a second course of TMS. For Group 2, we will be doing both scanning and treatment.

Background, Significance and Rationale
Background, Significance and Rationale
Significance: There are few therapeutic options for individuals with treatment resistant depression (TRD). 
One recently developed approach is rTMS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Recent studies have demonstrated overall antidepressant benefit of rTMS in patients who fail to respond to a trial of antidepressant medication (1, 2, 3). Nevertheless, for many patients the response is incomplete, suggesting the need for further optimization. One potential cause of heterogeneous response might relate to individual differences in brain anatomy and connectivity patterns. At present, the rTMS stimulation site across subjects is based upon fixed location relative to motor cortex. Potentially, however, the approach could be optimized by stimulating based upon individual brain functional connectivity pattern. The present project will collect pre- and post-treatment brain functional connectivity measures in a group of patients who will be receiving independent clinical rTMS for resistant depression, a connectivity-based targeting approach will be applied at the single-subject level to individualize therapy in those patients who do not respond to standard approaches.  The present study is based upon the hypothesis that the clinical efficacy of rTMS reflects functional connectivity between left DLPFC and remote regions such as the subgenual cingulate (sgACC), and that the precise regions of DLPFC that are functionally connected to sgACC may differ across individuals (4, 5). Thus, individualized functional connectivity patterns using standard resting-state functional connectivity measures may assist in optimizing rTMS efficacy across individuals. 
Background: The present research is based upon the theoretical conceptualization of depression as a network 
disorder that reflects alterations in function in a distributed network of regions including DLPFC (especially left), medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, sgACC, insula, thalamus, hypothalamus, and hippocampus (HPC). Retrograde tracer studies in nonhuman primates indicate that the DLPFC has reciprocal connections with sgACC (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The sgACC is a key region within the frontolimbic network and has consistently been shown to be metabolically hyperactive during depressive episodes (11, 12-16, 14, 15, 17, 18). Voxel-by-voxel analyses of neurophysiological data from depressed samples versus controls localized the peak difference in activity to the sgACC (19). In general, effective antidepressant treatments attenuate this sgACC metabolic hyperactivity (20, 14, 16, 21), supporting the importance of this region. Nevertheless, because of its deep location sgACC cannot be directly targeted by  non-invasive approaches such as TMS, and thus must be manipulated indirectly via networks that may themselves be dysfunctional in depression. The present study is also motivated by extensive literature suggesting that effects of rTMS are not confined to the local area of stimulation, but instead propagate beyond the site of stimulation, impacting a distributed network of brain regions (22-25). These observations suggest that rTMS may relieve depression by modulating synaptic strength both locally and at distant sites modulating functional connectivity in cortical networks. Part of the antidepressant mechanism of DLPFC rTMS may be remote suppression of activity in the sgACC and other limbic regions (20, 26, 27). Fox et al. (23), showed that target sites with the best rTMS

antidepressant efficacy exhibited the strongest anticorrelated resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 
the sgACC.The present study will test this hypothesis on a group of patients with MDD non-responders to standard TMS by conducting pre-treatment functional connectivity to enable targeting of rTMS based upon individualized connectivity maps. These locations will then be used at the NYSPI site and also given to the treating physician (Tarique Perera) to optimize target for focal brain stimulation and efficacy across individuals. Of note, patients from group 1 will be scanned at the NYSPI site but will not receive treatment here, whereas group 2 will both be scanned and receive treatment.
Our preliminary data in Fig. 1 shows results acquired from a subset of patients with MDD that reveals an 
increase in anti-correlation between left-DLPFC and sgACC consecutive to convulsive therapy. These results suggest that ability to deliver TMS pulse to special targets identified on functional connectivity maps (e.g. DLPFC) have the potential to positively confirm their involvement in MDD. Increase in anticorrelation of rsFC signal of these regions after TMS would amount to such evidence. This is exactly what we observed in convulsive therapy as is shown in Fig 1 in which green-blue-purple spectrum on the sgACC rsFC maps are the surface vertexes within BA46 with highest anticorrelation BOLD signal with sgACC. We seek to replicate this effect with targeted TMS in non-responders to standard TMS. Such strategy has the potential to optimize therapeutic efficacy of TMS (see Fig. 1, attached). Our justification for committing the non-responders to a second cycle of TMS is as following:1) The second cycle will use an entirely different type of TMS, i.e. neuronavigated TMS based on the functional connectivity maps obtained from patients’ brain which offers, hereto-forth, the best guide for the efficacy of TMS as shown in Fig. 1.2) Since the patients for the second cycle are randomized to receive either neuronavigated or standard TMS, we can justify a second cycle of standard TMS by statistics from Dr Perera’s clinics which are in agreement with application guidelines for the use of TMS ( Rossi et al., 2009). As for Dr Perera’s past experience is concerned, of the 139 patients that received 9 weeks of TMS, 60 responded at the 4 week point and 89 responded at the 8 week point. Of the 79 that did not respond at the 4 week measurement, 42 (more than 50%) responded at the week 8 point. Response is defined here as a 50% or greater reduction in starting Ham D score. As such, while the advantage of the second round of TMS is clear for the patients who receive neuronavigated TMS, even for the patients who receive the second round of standard TMS the above facts demonstrate the advantages of prolonged (4-8 week) treatment by TMS in the form of a 50% favorable outcome in that group of patients.
In addition to resting state functional connectivity, we will also assess glutamate (Glu) concentrations and 
resting-state cerebral blood flow/volume (rsCBF/rsCBV) in DLPFC and cortical midline structures (CMS) using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Arterial Spin Labelling (ASL), respectively. CMS refer to brain structures situated near the medial wall of the brain and is mainly comprised of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (the supragenual part in particular) and posterior cingulate cortex. Regional increases in Glu release increase the metabolic rate of post-synaptic neurons (28), and surrounding astrocytes (29), leading to regional BOLD signal increases (30). Glu concentrations may therefore be linked to overall functional connectivity patterns (31-34). In particular, Glu levels in left DLPFC in MDD provide an index of local metabolic  activity, and abnormalities can be 
reversed in a dose-dependent manner by rTMS (35). These effects are present not only close to the stimulation site (left DLPFC), but also in remote (right DLPFC, left cingulate cortex) brain regions.

Abnormal reduction of sgACC cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glucose metabolism in MDD have also been 
found (36-39). These apparently discrepant results have been explained by the interrelationships between deficits in gray matter volume and physiological imaging data. The reduction in sgACC volume produce partial volume effects in functional brain images due to their relatively low spatial resolution, when this volumetric deficit is taken into account by correcting the metabolic data for the partial volume averaging effect associated with the corresponding gray matter redu ction, metabolism instead appeared increased in the 
sgACC in the unmedicated-depressed phase and normal in the medicated-remitted phase (40).  Although MRS Glu levels and rsCBF/rsCBV will not be used to guide treatment location in the present study, nevertheless they will be analyzed to see if they can differentiate responders from non-responders to rTMS treatment approaches. fMRI, MRS and CBF/CBV procedures will be repeated following completion of the clinical protocol in order to evaluate potential clinical correlates of symptomatic improvement.
 
Specific Aims and Hypotheses
Specific Aims and Hypotheses
Specific aims of the project are as follows:  1)
     To conduct functional connectivity fMRI scans in a group of non-responders to standard TMS 
participating in an external rTMS clinical treatment protocol in order to permit individualized target location for targeted rTMS treatment. To personalize therapy, a functional connectivity-based targeting approach will be used to identify optimal TMS target coordinates in the left-DLPFC.  2)
     To determine whether fMRI functional connectivity, glu MRS and CBF/CBV abnormalities are 
associated with treatment outcome to rTMS. 3)
     To identify biological marker outcomes to treatment response as measured by 3-tesla MRI.  
We hypothesize that individual differences in connectivity between DLPFC and sgACC are large and can be used to generate individualized TMS targets that will result in response rates higher than those traditionally associated with rTMS. In addition, we hypothesize that pretreatment DLFPC and CMS glu levels and CBF/CBV abnormalities will assist in identification of treatment-responsive subjects.

Eligibility would be determined based upon the results of the existing evaluations and the Principal Investigator will document their continued validity. Inclusion criteria 1. Male or female outpatients, 18 to 60 years of age. Self report2. Primary diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder as confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID-IV). SCID, DSM-IV3. Duration of the index episode of at least 2 weeks. Psychiatric History4. MDD symptoms, defined as a total HDRS-17 score ≥ 18 despite treatment with an adequate trial of a 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI). An adequte SRI trial is defined as treatment for at least 6-8 weeks on the SRI, that meets the maximum recommended dosage level for MDD (fluoxetine 40-60 mg/d, sertraline 100- 200 mg/d, paroxetine 40-60 mg/d, fluvoxamine 200-300 mg/d, citalopram 40-60 mg/d, escitalopram 20-30 mg/d). We do not typically rely on an arbitrary upper cut-off on the HRSD because an arbitrary cut-off number would not capture the clinical salience of individual symptoms and clinical judgment must supersede (e.g. a HRSD of 18 but in the presence of active suicidal ideation and plan would exclude patient).

Eligibility screening may be conducted under
WIRB Protocol #20141643, “Cognitive Changes During Treatment with TMS for Major Depression”, Tarique Perera, MD, Principal Investigator; orNYSPI IRB Protocol #6669R, “Evaluation of Potential Participants for Depression Evaluation Service (DES) Research”, Jonathan Stewart, MD, Principal InvestigatorIf participants were enrolled in either of these studies and the screening evaluations were conducted within the prior six months, copies of all screening instruments will be made and reviewed by the study Principal Investigator. Eligibility would be determined based upon the results of the existing evaluations and the Principal Investigator will document their continued validity.  This protocol will recruit subjects from an ongoing study of rTMS treatment of depression being conducted by Dr. Tarique Perera who is a non-Columbia physician, and already approved by an independent IRB (WIRB protocol #20141643 entitled: “Cognitive Changes During Treatment with TMS for Major Depression”, see attachment). At NYSPI or at CBIC (Citigroup Biomedical Imagin g Center at Weill Cornell Medical College) MRI 
facility all patients will come to have a brief conversation with Dr. Moreno to verify eligibility to participate in this study, and to complete fMRI scans. Clinical assessments pre/post TMS treatments will be 
implemented at Contemporary Care or NYSPI. Patients will complete some assessments using StudyTrax. Group 1 are patients coming from Dr. Perera’s offices who will be scanned at the NYSPI or CBIC MRI Unit pre/post TMS treatments. TMS treatments for this group will be implemented under Dr. Perera’s protocol and WIRB. Group 2 are patients coming from Dr. Perera’s offices who will come to the NYSPI or CBIC site to be scanned at the NYSPI or CBIC MRI Unit pre/post TMS treatments. A second course of TMS will be imoplemented at any of Dr. Perera’s offices (only). For both, Group 1 and Group 2, we will be doing the scanning only (at NYSPI or CBIC) (Table 1. Timing of all Study Procedures attached). No 
treatments will be implemented at NYSPI.  Overview of Study Design:
Patients from Dr. Perera’s offices will be divided in 2 groups. Group 1 (N=30) will be depressed patients undergoing standard TMS for the first time. Group 2 (N=30) constitutes those who have previously demonstrated that they do not respond to standard TMS. MDD patients prescribed to receive standard TMS for the first time (group 1) will have resting-state FMRI in order to see if we can predict their responsiveness based on the functional connectivity maps. Non-responders to standard TMS approaches (Group 2) will be randomized (3:2) to either receive targeted (N=20) or standard (N=10) repetitive TMS (rTMS) treatments. A connectivity-based targeting strategy will be used on patients undergoing targeted

rTMS to optimize target for focal brain stimulation. Response is defined as a 50% or greater reduction in 
starting HDRS score. Raters and patients in group 2  will be kept blinded to the treatment assignment. All patients referred from the ongoing treatment study will be assessed by 3 tesla brain MRI, MRS and CBF/CBV procedures at baseline and immediately following the final treatment. At NYSPI we will only do the imaging component. All treatments will be implemented at any of Dr. Perea's offices.
Patients from group 1 will be scanned at the NYSPI or CBIC MRI Unit pre/post TMS treatments. TMS 
treatments for this group will be implemented under Dr. Perera’s protocol and WIRB. Patients from group 
2, will receive another cycle of standard versus targeted TMS, 5 times a week for 6 weeks (30 treatments), 
followed by a taper phase of 6 sessions to cover 3 treatments in week 1, 2 treatments in week 2 and 1 
treatment in week 3. For these patients, second visit to NYSPI or CBIC will occur after first cycle finishes and right before second cycle begins. Also will receive a second post-TMS scan after second cycle finishes (see Diagram 3). Patients will be classified as responders to TMS with at least 50% decrease in HDRS-24 scores from baseline. Patients will be classified as non-responders to TMS with less than 50% decrease in HDRS-24 scores from baseline. 
Screening:
A phone screen will be used for this study (NT TMS Screening Phone call Script attached). Patients will 
come to the NYSPI to meet with Dr. Moreno to verify eligibility, and after the patient signs the informed consent form and the HIPAA authorization, will undergo clinical assessments to assure adherence to all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be enrolled in the study. Dr. Moreno will explain to patients that at NYSPI they will only come for the imaging component and that no treatments will be implemented at the NYSPI site.   MRI, MRS and CBF/CBV Scanning:
 Subjects will undergo 3 tesla (3T) brain MRI-MRS-CBF/CBV scanning. None of the imaging modalities used in the study will include exogenous contrasts. MRI scans will be performed at the NYSPI or CBIC MRI facility immediately before and after the rTMS treatment. 1H MRS PRESS TE80, ASL, FSPGR, resting state MB EPI (BOLD) will be performed at 3T. Dr. Kangarlu will be responsible of Multiband EPI, PRESS and ASL for this study. To identify coordinates in the left DLPFC we will use functional connectivity (FC) seed based analysis centered on left DLPFC ROIs to identify the site (X) with peak anticorrelation with the sgACC.  DLPFC Mapping for targeted TMS (for group 2):
 Targets for focal brain stimulation with repetitive TMS will be modified based on the MRI. Methodology as follow:I. The subgenual region of interest (ROI) was constructed by placing a 5 mm radius sphere at MNI coordinates (6, 16, −10), masked to include only sampled grey matter voxels. These subgenual coordinates 
were chosen based on prior studies where a reduction in subgenual activity was associated with antidepressant response across a wide range of treatment modalities (Fox et al., 2012). Resting state functional connectivity across 500 healthy right-handed subjects from the Human Connectome Project data release (http://www.humanconnectome.org/data/) was used for initial analyses as an independent cohort to

construct an average group-level functional connectivity map. The entire subgenual functional connectivity 
map generated from this independent cohort was used as a mask to extract the average time course activation from each MDD patient. II. Use Matlab software to generate spheres of varying radii on T1W anatomical  images centered on node 
coordinates within the left DLPFC to account for varying focality of different potential cortical stimulation sites. This procedure will include the mapping of ROI spheres to the surface of MNI space, extract the time series courses and compute the correlation with the subgenual functional connectivity map to find the ROI with the highest anticorrelation value (X) that could serve as optimized target for focal brain stimulation. Next, we will warp the best ROI (X) into the subject native volume space for neuronavigation of TMS coil. TMS Treatments (for group 2):
 All standard TMS treatments for group 1 will be implemented at any of Dr. Perera's offices. Second cycle of TMS treatments for group 2 will be implemented at any of Dr. Perera's offices. Subjects of this group will be randomized to either receive standard versus navigated TMS (3:2). Patients will receive a total of 36 TMS treatments, 5 times a week for the first 6 weeks (30 treatments), followed by a taper phase go 6 sessions to cover 3 treatments in week 1, 2 treatments in week 2 and 1 treatment in week 3.  Using the NeuroStar Therapy System, the subject’s motor threshold (MT) will be determined and the coil placed over the left DLPFC guided by Brainsight Neuronavigation device, which uses MRI images loaded into the system to navigate the coil over the target within the DLPFC. All patients from group 2 will receive stimulation over the left DLPFC at 120% of the MT at a frequency of 10Hz; for a total of 3,000 pulses per session. A total of 36 treatment sessions will be provided over 9-weeks. All treatments will be 
implemented outside the NYSPI. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy System is the first TMS device cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) who have not benefited from antidepressant treatment. Treatment parameters in this study will follow FDA approval, i.e. stimulation pattern, time course, device and patient population. The "standard" procedure of coil positioning locates the left DLPFC at 5-cm anterior to the "hand motor hotspot" along the curvature of the scalp. Alternate stimulation site within the DLPFC in each patient will be used to personalize treatments based on their rsfMRI, therefore its application is considered off-label. Please find IDE Decision Worksheet in additional documents related to this study (uploads section). Brainsight for TMS:
 Brainsight is what is generally referred to as a neuronavigator (also often called a frameless stereotaxy device). Its main function is analogous to a GPS, but applied to the brain. The device takes as input, the structural MR images of the subject, and using an infrared position sensor and related accessories, maps the location and orientation of a TMS coil held on the subject’s head to the images and displays a representation of the coil on the images.This provides two important functions. First, it displays a live representation of the coil on the images on the computer screen, allowing the operator to accurate to use the MR images (and the anatomy shown by the images) to determine the location of the coil on the subject’s head. Second, fMRI images may be overlaid

on the structural images. These images may be used to define a location in the brain to be stimulated and the 
coordinates of this target stored. While holding the coil on the head, Brainsight indicates in which director to move the coil to quickly and accurately place the coil over the target. One placed, the system monitors the coil’s activity and can automatically record the coil’s position and orientation w.r.t. target for quality assurance. In addition to the coil, the subject’s head is also being monitored, so head movement is shown allowing immediate adjustment to the coil or head location to ensure consistent stimulation during the entire TMS session. 
Dr. Roch Comeau, president of Rogue Research Inc., is a consultant in this research project to support the 
portions of the project related to the use of the neuronavigation system and has adapted both navigators to work with Neuronetics stimulator. Please find Dr. Comeau's Letter uploaded in additional documents related to this study (uploads section). Rogue Research, Inc. is the company responsible for neuronavigation. Dr. Roch Comeau, President of Rogue Inc, will be available to ensure procedures for neuronavigation are followed accurately. He has already come to Contemporary Care to interface the Neuronavigational device with NeuroStar TMS devices to ensure proper use of neuronavigation to guide TMS coil.  An IDE is not required for the Brainsight Neuronavigation stereotaxic device. Please find attached a letter from Dr. Comeau, who is President of Brainsight Neuronavigation company that manufactures the device.  Criteria for Early Discontinuation:
 CGI-Global, HDRS-24 and C-SSRS will be assessed weekly in patients undergoing second course of TMS at any of Dr. Perera's offices, not at NYSPI.  A licensed MD assigned to the study will meet with patients 
weekly and assess clinical worsening, suicidality, and intolerable side effects. If patients show a worsening of their general psychopathological condition with 50% increase in HDRS-24 scores from baseline on 2 consecutive ratings or any occurrence of a CGI-I score of 6 or 7 will trigger a clinical evaluation and then a clinical judgment as to wether the patient should be discontinued. Such evaluations will be documented in the patient’s chart at Contemporary Care . If patients miss any three consecutive treatment sessions or any 
five treatment sessions, they will be dropped from the study, and after treatment recommendations they will be returned to routine clinical management under the supervision of Dr. Perera. In case patients appear to be at increased risk for suicide, he/she will be dropped from the study and 
accompanied to the ER for evaluation. Additionally, intolerable side effects or any medical worsening will result in immediate withdrawal from the study. All patients dropped out from the study will be returned to routine clinical management under the supervision of Dr. Perera.
Review for any incidental findings on MRI:
 
In adherence to the revised Incidental Findings Policy for neuroimaging done at Columbia as described in the 3/27/15 memo from the CUMC IRB, MRI research scans will be read by credentialed neuroradiologists within 2 weeks. The subject or his or her individual physician will be contacted by letter with information about their MRI research scan.

The "standard" procedure of positions the coil on the left DLPFC at 5-cm anterior to the "hand motor 
hotspot" along the curvature of the scalp (4, 8-11). However, this technique misses the DLPFC (6, 7) more than 1/3 of the times, since it does not account for differences in skull size or variations in prefrontal anatomy relative to motor cortex location.

We have designed a functional connectivity-based targeting strategy (NT TMS) that allows us to select the 
 target within DLPFC with much higher accuracy to assure individualized target location. This strategy is based upon the hypothesis that the clinical efficacy of rTMS depends on the FC between left DLPFC and remote regions such as the sgACC, and that the precise regions of DLPFC that are functionally connected to sgACC may differ across individuals. Thus, individualized FC patterns using standard rsFMRI FC measures offers the target for engagement of TMS across individuals more precisely. Such new targeting (NT) strategy for TMS is a novel intervention backed up by strong evidence from the scientific community and well-supported theoretical rationale that is ready for early-phase testing. Our proposed NT TMS has a high potential to reduce the burden of depression by precisely aiming the intervention to the sites directly involved in the networks known to be faulty in the brain of MDD patients.

Clinical Treatment Alternatives
Clinical treatment alternativesThere are non-drug and drug therapies available to treat depression. Depression is often initially treated with psychotherapy (talk therapy) and antidepressant medication administered together. Although antidepressants can be effective for some patients, they do not work for everybody. Additionally, antidepressants often result in unwanted side effects.Many patients do not receive adequate benefit from antidepressant medication and/or cannot tolerate the side effects caused by them. For these patients, alternative treatments that involve the use of a medical device are available. These treatments include transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). Dr. Moreno will discuss all other alternative treatments for depression with patients before the second course of TMS in group 2, including antidepressant medications, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). No treatment is provided at NYSPI.  
Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences 
Risks that could be encountered during the study period
Participants could become anxious, bored or tired while participating in medical or psychiatric screening  
    
MRIWhile there have been no reports of any harmful long-term effects caused by MRI magnets of the same or 
even higher strength as those used in this study, the long-term effects of being placed in a magnet are unknown. Although there are no risks associated with pregnancy, we will not scan anyone who is pregnant. Females in their childbearing years will be asked to take a pregnancy test for exclusion. Sometimes sensations such as tingling or twitching are experienced, which are caused by the magnetic field that can stimulate peripheral nerves. Exclusion criteria for the scan include pacemakers and other metallic implants, which would pose a risk to the subject if s/he we re exposed to strong magnetic fields. It may be 
uncomfortable to lie motionless in the MRI camera and it may cause some subjects to feel anxious and

claustrophobic. Normal operation of the MR system produces loud noises, and foam earplugs will be 
provided to reduce the noise. Our staff will be available to provide support, reduce anxiety, optimize the comfort of the subject and remove the subject from the scanner if requested. There are no known long-term risks from magnetic resonance imaging studies. An acute risk of burns to the skin is presented by medicinal skin patches, and subjects will be asked to remove patches before entering the scanner. Short-term risks also include tissue heating from excessive systemically absorbed radiofrequency radiation and stimulation of peripheral nerves from rapidly changing magnetic fields. Both software and hardware protection schemes are present in the equipment to prevent excessive amounts or rates of change of systemically absorbed radiofrequency radiation. At 3T, short-term side effects include mild dizziness, nausea, and metallic taste.These effects are due to movement within the magnetic field and are terminated when subjects cease head movement. The scanner to be used in this study (at NYSPI) is a non significant risk device. NeuroStar NT TMS TherapySeizures: In clinical trials using the NeuroStar Therapy System, which included over 10,000 TMS treatments, no seizures were reported. The current device labeling warns that the expected and observed frequency and - occurrence of seizures is less than 1 in 30,000 treatments (<0.003%) and 1 in 1000 patients (<0.1%). Rare cases have reported the development of seizures during or immediately after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Having a seizure includes a potential effect on your future employability, insurability, and ability to drive. Should you experience a seizure that is related to magnetic stimulation, your doctor will provide you with a letter stating that the seizure was produced under experimental conditions and that there is no reason to expect another occurrence.  Individuals who have a history of 
seizures or have been diagnosed with epilepsy will be excluded from this research study. Muscle Twitching: You may feel twitches in the muscles of your face during the magnetic stimulation. Headache: A mild headache can occur following TMS treatment that usually resolves soon after the procedure. The headaches may be from maintaining a fixed head position for the duration of the TMS treatment. We will try to reduce the risk of headache by assuring your comfort before and during the procedures.
Changes in hearing: The loud “click” produced by the TMS stimulator can cause temporary hearing changes 
following treatment. This is prevented by wearing soft foam earplugs during treatment. Low blood pressure and feelings of nausea: If you take blood pressure medications you may have a low blood pressure while sitting restfully in the research chair. Some may also have a feeling of nausea. Eating and taking fluid before the session will help prevent these symptoms. If these symptoms occur, the session will be stopped and resumed only when the symptoms resolve. Also, metal objects located close to the hand held TMS coil might move during magnetic stimulation. These items should be removed during treatment. Individuals with any metal implants will also be excluded from the research study.
All efforts will be made to minimize these risks by using only trained personnel who are experienced and 
skilled in using the device. Moreover, all TMS sessions will be performed in a medical setting with access

to a skilled medical team and life-support equipment. All TMS treatments will be implemented outside 
the NYSPI site.
 NT TMS is an investigational treatment which is not approved by the FDA. A licensed MD assigned to the study at any of Dr. Perera's offices will meet with patients weekly and assess clinical worsening, 
suicidality, and intolerable side effects. No NT TMS will be implemented at the NYSPI site.  If patients 
show a worsening of their general psychopathological condition, a clinical judgment after correspondent clinical evaluation will be made as to whether NT TMS treatments should be discontinued. If patients miss any three consecutive treatment sessions or any five treatment sessions, they will be dropped from the study, and after treatment recommendations they will be returned to routine clinical management under the supervision of Dr. Perera. 
TMS Neuronavigation System
There are no anticipated risks to you from the neuronavigator. Neuronavigation systems enable accurate planning, targeting and monitoring for brain stimulation studies using TMS.

Methods to Protect Confidentiality
Describe methods to protect confidentialityAll data (written and electronic) will be coded by number. A master list identifying subjects with codes will 
be kept under lock and key, separate from any research records or the computer  database, with access 
restricted to research staff, to the extent permitted by law. Only staff directly involved in this project will have access to the master list linking subject names to code numbers. In the informed consent form, subjects are told that the information they provide and all findings of testing will be kept strictly confidential, with access limited to the research staff, and possibly state or federal regulatory personnel. Information about the patients' condition and treatment will be kept in a computer but the patients' names will not appear in this database. The information will only be linked to a code number assigned for the purposed of maintaining privacy. Only members of the research team will have access to the computer. If a medical event occurs involving the NeuroStar TMS, Neuronetics, the manufacturer of the NeuroStar, may need to see confidential information as it relates to the event. 
Will the study be conducted under a certificate of confidentiality?
No

Thank you for participating in our study. We remind you that the MRI scan of the brain that we performed was 
for research purposes only. It would not show problems that would be picked up by a more specialized 
medical MRI scan ordered by your doctor for a specific medical problem. The scan provides little clinical 
information other than the presence or absence of certain irregularities. In fact, the absence of a finding does 
not mean that one is not present. 
 
 
The review of your scan was done by a doctor trained in brain MRI interpretation (a neuroradiologist) who 
found no obvious irregularities during the reading of the MRI. If you would like to request that a copy of 
the report be sent to your physician, please call Dr. Moreno-Ortega at 914-218-7311.   
 
Please contact us if you have any questions.   
 
  
 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
 
 Dr. Moreno-Ortega

As we mentioned in our recent telephone conversation, the review of your scan by a doctor trained in 
brain MRI interpretation (a neuroradiologist) showed an irregularity, and we recommend that you follow up 
with your physician as soon as possible to determine if any further action is necessary. If you would like to 
request that a copy of the report be sent to your physician, please call Dr. Moreno-Ortega at 914-218-7311.

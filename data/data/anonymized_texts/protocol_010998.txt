Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine  
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating phys ician.  
After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decrea sed to three  consecutive 
days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Followi ng Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 7 of 52 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity  is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective hematopoiesis and malignant expansi on of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy follo wed by consolidation chemotherapy or stem 
cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival  of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effecti ve in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typically 
require 3 -4 weeks of hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical t rials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematolog ic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpat ient setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 8 of 52 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS and AML 
patients (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However,  
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive da ys to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict respon se to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total ge nomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884 . 
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with response or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients  and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA

pharmacologic parameters that could clin ically predict p atient response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisiti on, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analys is of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typically followed with watchful -waiting rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine  in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferase leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition  of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an appr oximately 5 -fold more 
potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might explain why 
decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro at lower doses than 
azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing a ctivity at low doses, both agents 
have a direct cytotoxic effect at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine  has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improve d 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II s tudies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have no ted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in Germany 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 10 of 52 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using decitabine  to 
treat elderly AML patients or patients with relapsed AML, and this experi ence is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by deamination by liver cytidine deaminase. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Di sappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1 µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous infusion 
over 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the percent methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 13 of 52 was the time to blast clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they obse rved a correlation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by prolonged administration of 
decitabine. Further, that DNA methylcy tosine reduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
All correlative studies will be collected under HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for 
Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will 
be concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mu tations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by gene 
specific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow sa mples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± 4 and 
compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutat ion allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 14 of 52 allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response 
will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best res ponse,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 b one marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typ ically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpressi on profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content  will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 20 of 52 5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
5.1 Summary of Study Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, bio marker study of patients with AML or MDS 
who are treated with 10 consecutive days of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded from 
this trial, because other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment of FAB -M3 acute 
promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who a re < 60 years old and have not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followe d with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  See Section 8.0 for details  on 
correlative studies .  
 
Patie nts will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission w ith incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive  toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecutive days of treatmen t, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goa l of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited d ata regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by the treating physician. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.

Patients a re to be followed according to standard patient care procedures for 30 
days following the date of the last decitabine  dose to monitor for toxicity, survival , 
and response. Thereafter, the investigator or designee will record information on 
subsequent thera py, disease progression, and/or death every 6 months for 2 years 
after last dose of study drug or until the patient is lost to follow -up or dies.  
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented 
in the case report forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse eve nts, treatment may continue 
indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
 Documented and confirmed disease progression  
 Death  
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out co ntinuation of study drug  
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 Suspected pregnancy  
 Serious non -compliance with the study protocol  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Patient withdraws consent  
 Investigator removes the patient from study  
 The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study

5.4 Concomitant Thera py and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.4.1 Chem otherapy  
 
Patients cannot receive any chemotherapy within 21 days of study enrollment and 
must have recovered from any treatment -related toxicities. However, p atients may 
be receiv ing hydrea at enrollment  and may continue on hydrea through Cycle 2 of 
decitabine. An indication for hydrea following  2 cycles of decitabine is evidence 
that the patient is not responding and decitabine should be discontinued . Other than 
decitabine , patients cannot receive chemotherapy du ring this trial.

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 24 of 52 5.4.2 Growth Factors  
 
Erythroid growth factors  should not be routinely administered to patients during the 
study.  
 
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists  should not be routinely administered to patients 
during the study.  
 
Filgrastim (G -CSF)  or sargramostim (GM -CSF)  may be administered to patients

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 25 of 52 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A crit erion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias  are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dys function  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved t o below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment should 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose re duction, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow c omplete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at

treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Sec tion 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to

7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine  is an antimetabolite that can replace cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine activity has not been determined 
and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by correcting  
DNA methylation, a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activi ty is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparation  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconstituted solu tion should be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless used 
within 15 minutes of reconstitution, the  diluted solution must be prepared using 
cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 degrees 
F) for a maximum of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be administered ei ther as an inpatient or an outpatient.  
 
7.1.2 Supplier  
 
Decitabine is available commercially.

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 28 of 52 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythr oid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of m ild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent wit h CR.   In 
addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be independent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversio n to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may 
also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typically a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy to access for progressive disease .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission  is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse. 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 29 of 52 If there are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bo ne marrow, bone 
marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.

CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the definition 
of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a decrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bo ne marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, SD, 
PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts

In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will meet to review toxicity data at lea st every 6 
months following the activation of the first secondary site.  The report will be prepared by the 
statistician and will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(QASMC).  This report will include : 
 
 HRPO protocol numbe r, protocol title, Principal Investigator name, data coordinator 
name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
 Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, 
date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, s tudy status, and phase of study  
 History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual 
suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, 
error, or breach of confidentiality including start/stop  dates and reason  
 Study -wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual  including numbers from 
participating sites  
 Protocol activation d ate at each participating site  
 Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years  at each 
participating site  
 Expected accrual end date  and accrual by site  
 Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number of participants who 
have met each objective  
 Measures of efficacy  
 Early stopping rules with supporting data and list the number of participants who have 
met the early stopping rules  
 Summary of toxicities  at all participating sites  
 Abstract submissions/publications  
 Summary of any recent literature that may affect the safety or ethics of the study  
 
Until such a time as the first sec ondary site activates this protocol, a semi -annual DSM report to 
be prepared by the study team will be submitted to the QASM Committee beginning 6 months 
after study activation at Washington University.  
 
The study principal investigator and Research Patien t Coordinator will monitor for serious 
toxicities on an ongoing basis. Once the principal investigator or Research Patient Coordinator 
becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE will be reported to the HRPO and QASMC according 
to institutional guidelines.  
 
A DSMC will consist of no fewer than 3 members including 2 clinical investigators and a 
biostatistician.   Like investigators, DSMC members are subject to the Washington University 
School of Medicine  policies regarding standards of conduct. Individuals invi ted to serve on the 
DSMC will disclose any potential conflicts of interest to the trial principal investigator and/or 
appropriate university officials, in accordance with institution policies. Potential conflicts that 
develop during a trial or a member’s t enure on a DSMC must also be disclosed.

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 39 of 52 12.0 AUDITING  
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each site will be audited annually by 
Siteman  Cancer Center personnel (QASMC) unless the outside institution has an auditing 
mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be asked to send copies of all 
audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit notification will  be sent to the 
Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will obtain the audit materials from the 
participating institution.  
 
Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. 
Once accrual numb ers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the 
cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the research team. However, if 
during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the re search team will be 
asked to provide the additional charts within two working days.

Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 40 of 52 13.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Washington University requires that each participating site sends its informed consent document 
to be reviewed and approved by the Washington University Regulatory Coordinator (or designee) 
prior to IRB/IEC submission.    
 
Site activation is defined as whe n the secondary site has received official written documentation 
from the coordinating center that the site has been approved to begin enrollment.  At a minimum, 
each participating institution must have the following documents on file at Washington Univers ity 
prior to study activation : 
 
 Documentation of IRB approval of the study in the form of a letter or other official 
document from the participating institution’s IRB.  This documentation must show 
which version of the protocol was approved by the IRB.  
 Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent must 
include a statement that data will be shared with Washington University, including the 
Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if 
applicable), and the Was hington University study team.  
 Documentation of FWA, signed FDA Form 1572  (if applicable) , and the CVs of all 
participating investigators.  
 Protocol signature page signed and dated by the investigator at each participating site.  
 
The coordinating center Principal Investigator  (or designee)  is responsible for disseminating to the 
participating sites all study updates, amendments, reportable adverse events, etc.  Protocol/consent 
modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electronically to the secondary si tes within 4 
weeks of obtaining Washington University IRB approval.  Activated s econdary sites are expected

14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will

continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by contingency 
tables and assessed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 7 Version date: 11/15/2016   Page 42 of 52 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empirical critical P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by the total number of permutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is to determine whether any 
of these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
association that would 
warrant pre -treatment testing. 
We believe that a reasonable 
cut off would be if at least 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients c an be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using 2 -sample t -test or 
Mann -Whitney non -parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The change of total 
bone marrow DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association with both 
steady -state plasma  drug levels and response will be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed b y the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at  two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7 %, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70  ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between 45 evaluable respo nders and 55 evaluable non -
responders with an expected standard deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine  
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating phys ician.  
After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decrea sed to three  consecutive 
days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Followi ng Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 7 of 52 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity  is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective hematopoiesis and malignant expansi on of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy follo wed by consolidation chemotherapy or stem 
cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival  of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effecti ve in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typically 
require 3 -4 weeks of hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical t rials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematolog ic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpat ient setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 8 of 52 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS and AML 
patients (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However,  
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive da ys to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict respon se to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total ge nomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884 . 
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with response or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients  and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA

pharmacologic parameters that could clin ically predict p atient response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisiti on, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analys is of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typically followed with watchful -waiting rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine  in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferase leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition  of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an appr oximately 5 -fold more 
potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might explain why 
decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro at lower doses than 
azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing a ctivity at low doses, both agents 
have a direct cytotoxic effect at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine  has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improve d 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II s tudies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have no ted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in Germany 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 10 of 52 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using decitabine  to

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by deamination by liver cytidine deaminase. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Di sappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1 µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous infusion 
over 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the percent methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 13 of 52 was the time to blast clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they obse rved a correlation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by prolonged administration of 
decitabine. Further, that DNA methylcy tosine reduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
All correlative studies will be collected under HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for 
Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will 
be concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mu tations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by gene 
specific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow sa mples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± 4 and 
compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutat ion allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 14 of 52 allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response 
will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best res ponse,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 b one marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typ ically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpressi on profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content  will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 20 of 52 5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
5.1 Summary of Study Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, bio marker study of patients with AML or MDS 
who are treated with 10 consecutive days of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded from 
this trial, because other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment of FAB -M3 acute 
promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who a re < 60 years old and have not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followe d with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  See Section 8.0 for details  on 
correlative studies .  
 
Patie nts will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission w ith incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive  toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecutive days of treatmen t, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goa l of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited d ata regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by the treating physician. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.

subsequent thera py, disease progression, and/or death every 6 months for 2 years 
after last dose of study drug or until the patient is lost to follow -up or dies.  
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented 
in the case report forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse eve nts, treatment may continue 
indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
 Documented and confirmed disease progression  
 Death  
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out co ntinuation of study drug  
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 Suspected pregnancy  
 Serious non -compliance with the study protocol  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Patient withdraws consent  
 Investigator removes the patient from study

5.4 Concomitant Thera py and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.4.1 Chem otherapy  
 
Patients cannot receive any chemotherapy within 21 days of study enrollment and 
must have recovered from any treatment -related toxicities. However, p atients may 
be receiv ing hydrea at enrollment  and may continue on hydrea through Cycle 2 of 
decitabine. An indication for hydrea following  2 cycles of decitabine is evidence 
that the patient is not responding and decitabine should be discontinued . Other than 
decitabine , patients cannot receive chemotherapy du ring this trial.

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 24 of 52 5.4.2 Growth Factors  
 
Erythroid growth factors  should not be routinely administered to patients during the 
study.  
 
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists  should not be routinely administered to patients 
during the study.  
 
Filgrastim (G -CSF)  or sargramostim (GM -CSF)  may be administered to patients 
with septic shock or febrile neutropenia at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
5.4.3 Transfusions  
 
 Packed red blood cells  (RBCs)  transfusion :   
RBC transfusions will be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
 
 Platelet transfusion :

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 25 of 52 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A crit erion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias  are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dys function  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved t o below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment should 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose re duction, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow c omplete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at 
six week intervals, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days of 
treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Sec tion 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to 
three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 26 of 52 7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine  is an antimetabolite that can replace cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine activity has not been determined 
and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by correcting  
DNA methylation, a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activi ty is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparation  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconstituted solu tion should be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless used 
within 15 minutes of reconstitution, the  diluted solution must be prepared using 
cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 degrees 
F) for a maximum of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be administered ei ther as an inpatient or an outpatient.  
 
7.1.2 Supplier  
 
Decitabine is available commercially.

Bone marrow samples  will be collected pre-study , on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, and on Day 28  ± 4 of 
Cycle 1 , 2, 4, and 6  for correlative studies. Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . The bone 
marrow samples will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for  Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be concurrently 
enrolled in.  
 
Skin biopsy sample  will be collected as part of the patient’s participation in HRPO# 201011766 
(“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Malignancies”). 
There is no required time  frame for this  sample , and it may have been collected months or even 
years prior to the first dose of decitabine.

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 28 of 52 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythr oid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of m ild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent wit h CR.   In 
addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be independent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversio n to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may 
also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typically a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy to access for progressive disease .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission  is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse.

CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the definition 
of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a decrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bo ne marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.

PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts (for 
patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for patients

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 37 of 52 11.0 DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will meet to review toxicity data at lea st every 6 
months following the activation of the first secondary site.  The report will be prepared by the 
statistician and will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(QASMC).  This report will include : 
 
 HRPO protocol numbe r, protocol title, Principal Investigator name, data coordinator 
name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
 Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, 
date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, s tudy status, and phase of study  
 History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual 
suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, 
error, or breach of confidentiality including start/stop  dates and reason  
 Study -wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual  including numbers from 
participating sites  
 Protocol activation d ate at each participating site  
 Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years  at each 
participating site  
 Expected accrual end date  and accrual by site  
 Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number of participants who 
have met each objective  
 Measures of efficacy  
 Early stopping rules with supporting data and list the number of participants who have 
met the early stopping rules  
 Summary of toxicities  at all participating sites  
 Abstract submissions/publications  
 Summary of any recent literature that may affect the safety or ethics of the study  
 
Until such a time as the first sec ondary site activates this protocol, a semi -annual DSM report to 
be prepared by the study team will be submitted to the QASM Committee beginning 6 months 
after study activation at Washington University.  
 
The study principal investigator and Research Patien t Coordinator will monitor for serious 
toxicities on an ongoing basis. Once the principal investigator or Research Patient Coordinator 
becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE will be reported to the HRPO and QASMC according 
to institutional guidelines.  
 
A DSMC will consist of no fewer than 3 members including 2 clinical investigators and a 
biostatistician.   Like investigators, DSMC members are subject to the Washington University 
School of Medicine  policies regarding standards of conduct. Individuals invi ted to serve on the 
DSMC will disclose any potential conflicts of interest to the trial principal investigator and/or 
appropriate university officials, in accordance with institution policies. Potential conflicts that 
develop during a trial or a member’s t enure on a DSMC must also be disclosed.

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 39 of 52 12.0 AUDITING  
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each site will be audited annually by 
Siteman  Cancer Center personnel (QASMC) unless the outside institution has an auditing 
mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be asked to send copies of all 
audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit notification will  be sent to the 
Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will obtain the audit materials from the 
participating institution.  
 
Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. 
Once accrual numb ers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the 
cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the research team. However, if 
during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the re search team will be 
asked to provide the additional charts within two working days.

Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 40 of 52 13.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Washington University requires that each participating site sends its informed consent document 
to be reviewed and approved by the Washington University Regulatory Coordinator (or designee) 
prior to IRB/IEC submission.    
 
Site activation is defined as whe n the secondary site has received official written documentation 
from the coordinating center that the site has been approved to begin enrollment.  At a minimum, 
each participating institution must have the following documents on file at Washington Univers ity 
prior to study activation : 
 
 Documentation of IRB approval of the study in the form of a letter or other official 
document from the participating institution’s IRB.  This documentation must show 
which version of the protocol was approved by the IRB.  
 Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent must 
include a statement that data will be shared with Washington University, including the 
Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if 
applicable), and the Was hington University study team.  
 Documentation of FWA, signed FDA Form 1572  (if applicable) , and the CVs of all 
participating investigators.  
 Protocol signature page signed and dated by the investigator at each participating site.  
 
The coordinating center Principal Investigator  (or designee)  is responsible for disseminating to the 
participating sites all study updates, amendments, reportable adverse events, etc.  Protocol/consent 
modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electronically to the secondary si tes within 4 
weeks of obtaining Washington University IRB approval.  Activated s econdary sites are expected 
to submit protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs within 4 weeks of receipt  unless 
otherwise noted .  Upon the secondary sites obtainin g local IRB approval, documentation of such

14.1 Analysis Populations  
 
Intent -to-Treat  - The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all patients wh o 
receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all patients 
who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by contingency 
tables and assessed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 6 Version date: 07/21/2016   Page 42 of 52 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empirical critical P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by the total number of permutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is to determine whether any 
of these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
association that would 
warrant pre -treatment testing. 
We believe that a reasonable 
cut off would be if at least 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients c an be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using 2 -sample t -test or 
Mann -Whitney non -parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The change of total 
bone marrow DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association with both 
steady -state plasma  drug levels and response will be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed b y the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at  two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7 %, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70  ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between 45 evaluable respo nders and 55 evaluable non -
responders with an expected standard deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.  
 
14.2.4  Safety Analysis

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecut ive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating phys ician.  
After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may furth er be decreased to three  consecutive 
days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, an d 6. Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 6 of 51 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity  is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective hematopoiesis and malignant expansi on of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy follo wed by consolidation chemotherapy or stem 
cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival  of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effecti ve in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typically 
require 3 -4 weeks of hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical t rials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patient s are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpatient  setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 7 of 51 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS and AML 
patients (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However, 
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabi ne to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive da ys to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict respon se to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total ge nomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884.  
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with respo nse or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response wi th mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA

pharmacologic parameters that could clinically predict p atient res ponse to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of  mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will  identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analysis of AML 
and MDS patients is reas onable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typically followed with watchful -waiting rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA me thyltransferase leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated  with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately 5 -fold more 
potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might explain why 
decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro at lower doses than 
azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing activity at low doses, both agents 
have a direct cytotoxic effect  at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improved 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have noted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of th ese results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in Germany 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 9 of 51 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using decitabine  to 
treat elderly AML patients or patients with relapsed AML, and this experi ence is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by deamination by liver cytidine deaminase. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Di sappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1 µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous infusion 
over 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the perce nt methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 12 of 51 was the time to blast clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they observed a co rrelation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by prolonged administration of 
decitabine. Further, that DNA methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
All correlative studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for 
Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will 
be concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mu tations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by gene 
specific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow sa mples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± 4 and 
compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutat ion allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 13 of 51 allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response 
will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best res ponse,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 b one marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typ ically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpressi on profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content  will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

5.1 Summary of Study Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, biomarker study of patients with AML or MDS 
who are treated with 10 consecutive day s of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded from 
this trial, because other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment of FAB -M3 acute 
promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < 60 years old and have not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are als o excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study, on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  See Section 8.0 for details  on 
correlative studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on  actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine  administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decre ased to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by  the treating physician. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.

5.2.10  Post-study Follow -up 
 
Patients are to be followed according to standard patient care procedures for 30 
days following the date of the last decitabine  dose to monitor for toxicity, survival , 
and response. Thereafter, the investigator or designee will record information on 
subsequent therapy, disease progression, and/or death every 6 months for 2 years 
after last dose of study drug or until the patient is lost to follow -up or dies.  
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented 
in the case report forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
 Documented and confirmed disease progression  
 Death  
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug  
 General or specific changes in the p atient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 Suspected pregnancy  
 Serious non -compliance with the study protocol  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Patient withdraws consent  
 Investigator removes the patient fro m study  
 The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar.  
 
5.4 Concomitant Therapy  and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.4.1 Chem otherapy  
 
Patients cannot receive any chemotherapy within 21 days of study enrollment and 
must have recovered from any treatment -related toxicities. However, p atients may 
be receiv ing hydrea at enrollment  and may continue on hydrea through Cycle 2 of 
decitabine. An indication for hydrea following  2 cycles of decitabine is evidence 
that the patient is not responding and decitabine should be discontinued . Other than 
decitabine , patients cannot receive chemotherapy during this trial.

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 23 of 51 5.4.2 Growth Factors  
 
Erythroid growth factors  should not be routinely administered to patients during the 
study.  
 
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists  should not be routinely administered to patients 
during the study.  
 
Filgrastim (G -CSF)  or sargramostim (GM -CSF)  may be administered to patients

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 24 of 51 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should hav e treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and  serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment s hould 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achiev e morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and t he cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at 
six week intervals, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days of 
treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to 
three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 25 of 51 7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine is an antimetabolite that can replace cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine activity has not been determined 
and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by correcting 
DNA methylation, a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor g ene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar t o other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparation  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconstituted solution should be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless used 
within 15 minutes of r econstitution, the diluted solution must be prepared using 
cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 degrees 
F) for a maximum of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be administered either as an inpatient or an outpatient.  
 
7.1.2 Supplier  
 
Decitabine is available commercially.

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 26 of 51 8.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES SAMPLE COLLECTIONS  
 
Bone marrow samples  will be collected pre-study , on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, and on Day 28  ± 4 of 
Cycle 1 , 2, 4, and 6  for correlative studies. Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . The bone 
marrow samples will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acq uisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be concurrently 
enrolled in.  
 
Skin biopsy sample  will be collected as part of the patient’s participation in HRPO# 201011766 
(“Tissue Acquisition for Ana lysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Malignancies”). 
There is no required time  frame for this  sample , and it may have been collected months or even 
years prior to the first dose of decitabine.

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 27 of 51 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY  AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors cons titute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition,  ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be independent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyo type. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may 
also be considered a partial remissi on.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typically a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy to access for progressive disease .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥ 5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse. 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 28 of 51 If there are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone 
marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confir m relapse.

CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the definition 
of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a decrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblas ts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, SD, 
PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts (for 
patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for patients

may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
All unexpected SAEs must be reported to the FDA.  
 
10.1.3  Unexpected Adverse Experience  
 
Definition:  any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current investigator brochure (or risk information, if an IB is not 
required or available).  
 
Events that are both serious AND unexpected must be reported to the F DA.  
 
10.1.4  Life-Threatening Adverse Experience  
 
Definition:  any adverse drug experience that places the subject (in the view of the 
investigator) at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that, had it  occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
 
Life-threatening adverse experiences must be reported to the FDA.  
 
10.1.5  Unanticipated Problems  
 
Definition:  
 
 unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures tha t are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) 
the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 related or possibly related to participation in the research ( in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures 
involved in the research); and  
 suggests that the research places subjects or others at a gr eater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
10.1.6  Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  failure to follow any applicable regulation or institutional policies that 
govern human subjects research or failure to follow the determinations of the 
IRB.   Noncompliance may occur due to lack of knowledge or due to deliberate 
choice to ignore regulatio ns, institutional policies, or determinations of the IRB.

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 33 of 51 10.1.7  Serious Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  noncompliance that materially increases risks, that results in substantial 
harm to subjects or others, or that materially compromises the rights or welfare of 
participants.  
 
10.1.8  Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned deviation from the approved protocol that are under the 
research team’s control. Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular 
situation.  
 
Local IRB Pre-approval of all protocol exception s must be obtained prior to the 
event.   For secondary sites, the Washington University PI wil l issue approval of the 
exception, but it must also be submitted to the local IRB with documentation of 
approval forwarded to Washington University.  Washington Un iversity IRB  
approval is not required for protocol exceptions occurring at secondary sites.  
 
10.2 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) at Washington 
University:  
 
The PI is required to promptly notify the IRB of the following events:  
 
 Any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others which occur 
at WU, any BJH or SLCH institution, or that impacts participants or the conduct of 
the study.  
 Noncompliance with federal regulations or the requirements or determinations of 
the IRB. 
 Receipt of new information that may impact the willingness of participants to 
participate or continue participation in the research study.  
 
These events must be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the occurrence of the 
event or notification t o the PI of the event.   The death of a research participant that qualifies 
as a reportable event should be reported within 1 working day  of the occurrence of the 
event or notification to the PI of the event.  
 
10.3 Reporting to the Quality Assurance and Safety M onitoring Committee 
(QASMC) at Washington University  
 
The PI is required to notify the QASMC of any unanticipated problem occurring at WU or 
any BJH or SLCH institution that has been reported to and acknowledged by HRPO as 
reportable.  (Unanticipated problems reported to HRPO and withdrawn during the review 
process need not be reported to QASMC.)  
 
QASMC must be notified within 10 days  of receipt of IRB acknowledgment via email to 
a QASMC auditor.

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 34 of 51  
10.4 Reporting Requirements for Secondary Sites  
 
The research team at each secondary site is required to promptly notify the Washington 
University PI and research coordinator of all reportable events (as described in Section 7.6) 
within 1 working day  of the occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s 
PI of the event.  This notification may take place via email if there is not yet enough 
information for a formal written report (using either an FDA MedWatch form if required 
or an institutional SAE reporting form if not).  A formal writte n report must be sent to the 
Washington University PI and research coordinator within 10 working days  of the 
occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI of the event.  The death 
of a research participant that qualifies as a reportabl e event should be reported within 1 
working day  of the occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI of the 
event.  
 
The research team at a secondary site is responsible for following its site’s guidelines for 
reporting applicable event s to its site’s IRB according to its own institutional guidelines.   
The research team at Washington University is responsible for reporting all applicable 
events to the FDA.  
 
10.5 Reporting to Secondary Sites  
 
The Washington University PI (or designee) will no tify the research team at each secondary 
site of all reportable events that have occurred at other sites within 10 working days  of the 
occurrence of the event or notification of the PI of the event.  This includes events that take 
place both at Washington University and at other secondary sites, if applicable.  
 
10.6 Reporting to the FDA  
 
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  
PLEASE NOTE THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FDA DIFFER 
FROM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HRPO/QASMC.  It is the 
responsibility of the Washington University principal investigator to report any 
unanticipated problem to the FDA as follows:  
 
 Report any unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences  (Section 
10.1.4) associated with use of the drug by telephone or fax no later than 7 calendar 
days  after initial receipt of the information.   
 Report any serious, unexpected adverse experienc es (Sect ion 10.1.2), as well as 
results from animal studies that suggest significant clinical risk within 15 calendar 
days  after initial receipt of this information.   
 
All MedWatch forms will be sent by the investigator or investigator’s team to the FDA at 
the following address or by fax:

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 36 of 51 11.0 DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will meet to review toxicity data at least every 6 
months following the activation of the first secondary site.  The report will be prepared by the 
statistician and will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(QASMC).  This report will include : 
 
 HRPO protocol nu mber, protocol title, Principal Investigator name, data coordinator 
name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
 Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, 
date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit , study status, and phase of study  
 History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual 
suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, 
error, or breach of confidentiality including start/s top dates and reason  
 Study -wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual  including numbers from 
participating sites  
 Protocol activation d ate at each participating site  
 Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years  at each 
participating site  
 Expected accrual end date  and accrual by site  
 Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number of participants who 
have met each objective  
 Measures of efficacy  
 Early stopping rules with supporting data and list the number of participants who have 
met the early stopping rules  
 Summary of toxicities  at all participating sites  
 Abstract submissions/publications  
 Summary of any recent literature that may affect the safety or ethics of the study  
 
Until such a time as the first second ary site activates this protocol, a semi -annual DSM report to 
be prepared by the study team will be submitted to the QASM Committee beginning 6 months 
after study activation at Washington University.  
 
The study principal investigator and Research Patient C oordinator will monitor for serious 
toxicities on an ongoing basis. Once the principal investigator or Research Patient Coordinator 
becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE will be reported to the HRPO and QASMC according 
to institutional guidelines.  
 
A D SMC will consist of no fewer than 3 members including 2 clinical investigators and a 
biostatistician.   Like investigators, DSMC members are subject to the Washington University 
School of Medicine  policies regarding standards of conduct. Individuals invited  to serve on the 
DSMC will disclose any potential conflicts of interest to the trial principal investigator and/or 
appropriate university officials, in accordance with institution policies. Potential conflicts that 
develop during a trial or a member’s tenu re on a DSMC must also be disclosed.

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 38 of 51 12.0 AUDITING  
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each site will be audited annually by 
Siteman Cancer Center personnel (QASMC) unless the outside institution has an auditing 
mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be asked to send copies of all 
audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit notification will be sent to the 
Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will obtain the audit materials from the 
participating institution.  
 
Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. 
Once accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the 
cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the research team. However, if 
during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the research team will be 
asked to provide the additional charts within two working days.

Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 39 of 51 13.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Washington University requires that each participating site sends its informed consent document 
to be reviewed and approved by the Washington University Regulatory Coordinator (or designee) 
prior to IRB/IEC submission.    
 
Site activation is defined as whe n the secondary site has received official written documentation 
from the coordinating center that the site has been approved to begin enrollment.  At a minimum, 
each participating institution must have the following documents on file at Washington Univers ity 
prior to study activation : 
 
 Documentation of IRB approval of the study in the form of a letter or other official 
document from the participating institution’s IRB.  This documentation must show 
which version of the protocol was approved by the IRB.  
 Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent must 
include a statement that data will be shared with Washington University, including the 
Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if 
applicable), and the Was hington University study team.  
 Documentation of FWA, signed FDA Form 1572  (if applicable) , and the CVs of all 
participating investigators.  
 Protocol signature page signed and dated by the investigator at each participating site.  
 
The coordinating center Principal Investigator  (or designee)  is responsible for disseminating to the 
participating sites all study updates, amendments, reportable adverse events, etc.  Protocol/consent 
modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electronically to the secondary si tes within 4 
weeks of obtaining Washington University IRB approval.  Activated s econdary sites are expected 
to submit protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs within 4 weeks of receipt  unless 
otherwise noted .  Upon the secondary sites obtainin g local IRB approval, documentation of such 
shall be sent to the Washington University study team within 2 weeks of receipt of approval.  
 
Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual continuing reviews, protocol 
amendments or revisions, all  SAE reports, and all protocol violations/deviations/exceptions must 
be kept on file at Washington University.  
 
The investigator or a designee from each institution must participate in a regular conference call 
to update and inform regarding the progress o f the trial.

14.1 Analysis Populations  
 
Intent -to-Treat  - The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all patients wh o 
receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all patients 
who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by contingency 
tables and assessed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 5 Version date: 04/21/16   Page 41 of 51 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empirical critical P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by the total number of permutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is to determine whether any 
of these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
association that would 
warrant pre -treatment testing. 
We believe that a reasonable 
cut off would be if at least 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients c an be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using 2 -sample t -test or 
Mann -Whitney non -parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The change of total 
bone marrow DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association with both 
steady -state plasma  drug levels and response will be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed b y the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at  two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7 %, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70  ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between 45 evaluable respo nders and 55 evaluable non -
responders with an expected standard deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.  
 
14.2.4  Safety Analysis  
 
Extent of Exposure  – Duration (number of cycles/infusions ) of decitabine  doses 
(cumulative and intensity) will be summarized.

according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0. The incidence of maximum grade (number 
and percent of patients experiencing the maximum grade during the study) will be 
summarized for each laboratory parameter.  Similar summaries will be provided by 
treatment cycle.   Graphical displays of select hematological parameters will also be 
provided.  
 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Safety Observations  – Vital signs, 
findings from physical examinations, ECOG scores and weights will be presented

14.2.5  Description of Planned Subgroup Analyses  
 
The following subgroups (if sufficient numbers of patients) will be explored with 
respect to the primary and overall survival endpoints.  
 Age (60-69 years old vs ≥ 70 years old)  
 Cytogenetics  
 Patients with AML -associated mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1, or 
IDH2 vs those who do not have somatic variants in these genes.  
 
14.3 Sample Size  
 
We anticipate initially enrolling 25 patients at Washington University. Once we establish 
a routine exome analysis  with validation and calculation of the rate of patient -specific 
mutation clearance, we will enroll an additional 100 patients from at least 2 additional 
centers.

2 To be performed within 7 days  of the first dose of decitabine.  
3 Decitabine may be reduced to Days 1 -5 or Days 1 -3. See Section 6.3 for details.  
a To include height, weight, and ECOG . 
b To include weight.  
c Care should be given to record the frequency of transfusions from 8 weeks prior to first dose of study drug  through 
the duration of the study.  
d Bone marrow biopsy  and aspirate  should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, and at  Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4 and 6 for clinical disease assessment. Patients who achieve with clinical response (CRi or better) and are receiving 
cycles every 6 weeks, will undergo bone marrow biopsies on day 42 ± 4.  Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies 
should be per formed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.  Standard bone marrow 
procurement procedures will be followed for collection of the tissue. To include:  correlative studies (collected under 
HRPO # 201011766), morpholog ic assessment , cytogenetics and FISH at all t ime points . A skin biopsy sample ( collected 
under HRPO # 201011766) is required at pre -study, but may have been collected months or even years prior to first dose 
of decitabine.  
e On bone marrow or peripheral blood.  
f After Cycle 1 , these labs may be obtained every other week  (CBC)  or once a month (Chemistries) at the discretion of 
the treating physician.  
g Serum chemistries include bicarbonate, calcium, glucose, total protein, alb umin, BUN, potassium, chloride, sodium, 
creatinine, total bilirubin, AST, ALT , alkaline phosphatase, and LDH . 
h Decitabine treatment will be 20 mg/m2 over a 1 -hour IV infusion on consecutive Days 1 -10 every 28 -day cycle .   The 
dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the beginning of each cycle . Patient s may be premedicated 
with lorazepam, prochlorperazine, palonosetron, or ondansetron at the treating physician’s discretion.  
i Patients will be followed for  30 days following the date of the last decitabine  dose to monitor for toxicity, survival 
and response. Thereafter , the investigator or designee will record information on subsequent therapy, disease 
progression, and death, every 6 months for 2 years after first dose of study drug or until t he patient is lost to follow -up.

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physcian.  
After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decreased to three  consecutive 
days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 8 of 51 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity  is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective hematopoiesis and malignant expansi on of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy follo wed by consolidation chemotherapy or stem 
cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival  of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effecti ve in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typically 
require 3 -4 weeks of hospitalization f or treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematolog ic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpat ient setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 9 of 51 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS and AML 
patients (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However,  
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive da ys to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict respon se to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total ge nomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884 . 
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with response or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 10 of 51 methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively assess genomic and 
pharmacologic parameters tha t could clinically predict p atient response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutati on acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML , presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analys is of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typically followed with watchful -waiting rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine  in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferase leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition  of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an appr oximately 5 -fold more 
potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might explain why 
decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro at lower doses than 
azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing a ctivity at low doses, both agents 
have a direct cytotoxic effect at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine  has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improve d 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II s tudies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have no ted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in Germany 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 11 of 51 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using decitabine  to 
treat elderly AML patients or patients with relapsed AML, and this experi ence is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by deamination by liver cytidine deaminase. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Di sappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1 µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous infusion 
over 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the percent methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 14 of 51 was the time to blast clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they obse rved a correlation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by prolonged administration of 
decitabine. Further, that DNA methylcy tosine reduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
All correlative studies will be collected under HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for 
Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will 
be concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mu tations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by gene 
specific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow sa mples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± 4 and 
compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutat ion allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation 
Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 15 of 51 allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response 
will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best res ponse,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 b one marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typ ically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpressi on profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
 
4. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content  will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 21 of 51 5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
5.1 Summary of Study Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, biomarker study of patients with AML or MDS 
who are treated with 10 consecutive days of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded from 
this tr ial, because other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment of FAB -M3 acute 
promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < 60 years old and have not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curat ive possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  See Section 8.0 for details  on 
correlativ e studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecut ive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will  be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study.  Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by the treating physician. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integ ration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.

5.4 Concomitant Therapy  and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.4.1 Chem otherapy  
 
Patients cannot receive any chemotherapy within 21 days of study enrollment and 
must have recovered from any treatment -related toxicities. However, p atients may 
be receiv ing hydrea at enrollment  and may continue on hydrea through Cycle 2 of 
decitabine. An indication for hydrea following  2 cycles of decitabine is evidence 
that the patient is not responding and decitabine should be discontinued . Other than 
decitabine , patients cannot receive chemotherapy during this trial.  
 
5.4.2 Growth Factors  
 
Erythroid growth factors  should not be routinely administered to patients during the 
study.  
 
Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 25 of 51 Thrombopoietin receptor agonists  should not be routinely adminis tered to patients 
during the study.  
 
Filgrastim (G -CSF)  or sargramostim (GM -CSF)  may be administered to patients 
with septic shock or febrile neutropenia at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
5.4.3 Transfusions  
 
 Packed red blood cells  (RBCs)  transfusion :   
RBC transfusions will be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
 
 Platelet transfusion :

Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 26 of 51 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone do es not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional up per limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For g rade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment should 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabin e administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at 
six week intervals, the dose m ay be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days of 
treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to 
three  consecutiv e days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 27 of 51 7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine is an antimetabolite that can replace cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine activit y has not been determined 
and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by correcting 
DNA methylation, a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation  blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells.  Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabi ne may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA met hyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparation  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconstituted solution should  be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless used 
within 15 minutes of reconstitution, the diluted so lution must be prepared using 
cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 degrees 
F) for a maximum of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be administered either as an inpatient or an outpatient.  
 
7.1.2 Supplier  
 
Decitabine is available commercially.

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 28 of 51 8.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES SAMPLE COLLECTIONS  
 
Bone marrow samples  will be collected pre-study , on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, and on Day 28  ± 4 of 
Cycle 1 , 2, 4, and 6  for correlative studies. Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . The bone 
marrow samples will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be concurrently 
enrolled in.  
 
Skin biopsy sample  will be collected as part of the patient’s participation in HRPO# 201011766  
(“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Malignancies”). 
There is no required time  frame for this  sample , and it may have been collected months or even 
years prior to the first dose of decitabine.

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 29 of 51 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFET Y AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors cons titute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition,  ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be independent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyo type. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may 
also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typically a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total perip heral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy to access for progressive disease .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse. 
Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 30 of 51 If there are no blasts in the peripher al blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone 
marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.  
 
9.2 Response Criteria  - MDS  
 
MDS Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:69 
 
Complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all 
cell lines in the bone marrow and peripheral blood values of Hgb > 11g/dL, Platelets > 100 
x 109/L, Neutrophils > 1.0 x 109/L, and 0% blasts. Persistent dysplasia does not exclude 
CR but will be noted.  
 
Marro w Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the definition 
of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a d ecrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute

10.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
Definition:   any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject including any 
abnormal sign, symptom, or disease.  
 
Grading:   the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be uti lized for all 
toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
web site:  http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html .  Grade 1 -2 events will be recorded for 
the fi rst fifty enrolled patients. Subsequently, only events graded as 3 or greater will be 
recorded. Fifty patients should be sufficient to estimate the true incidence of any adverse 
event to within ± 14% with 95% confidence intervals.  
Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by the Department of Health and Human 
Services’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can

procedure s that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 related or possibly related to participation in the resea rch (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, 
experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the 
research); and  
 suggests that the research places subjects or others at  a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
10.3 Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  failure to follow any applicable regulation or institutional policies that govern 
human subjects research or failure to follow the determinations of the

team’s control. Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular situation.  
 
Local IRB Pre-approval of all protocol exception s must be obtained prior to the event.   For 
secondary sites, the Washington University PI will issue approval of the exception, but it 
must also be submitted to the local IRB with documentation of approval forwarded to 
Washington University.  HRPO approval  is not required for protocol exceptions occurring 
at secondary sites.  
 
10.6 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) and the Quality 
Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) at Washington 
University:  
 
The PI is required to promptly not ify the IRB of the following events:  
 
 Any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others which occur 
at WU, any BJH or SLCH institution, or that impacts participants or the conduct of 
the study.  
 Noncompliance with federal regulations or the requirements or determinations of 
the IRB.  
 Receipt of new information that may impact the willingness of participants to 
participate or continue participation in the research study.  
 
These events must be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the occurrence of the 
event or notification to the PI of the event.   The death of a research participant that qualifies 
as a reportable event should be reported within 1 working day  of the occurrence of the 
event or notification to the PI of the event.  
 
10.7 Reporting Requirements for Secondary Sites  
 
The research team at each secondary site is required to promptly notify the Washington 
University PI and research coordinator of all reportable events (as described in Section 7.6) 
within 1 working day  of the o ccurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s 
PI of the event.  This notification may take place via email if there is not yet enough 
information for a formal written report (using either an FDA MedWatch form if required 
or an institutiona l SAE reporting form if not).  A formal written report must be sent to the 
Washington University PI and research coordinator within 10 working days  of the 
occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI of the event.  The death 
of a rese arch participant that qualifies as a reportable event should be reported within 1 
working day  of the occurrence of the event or notification of the secondary site’s PI of the 
event.

sites, if applicable.  
 
10.9 Reporting to the FDA  
 
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  
PLEASE NOTE THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FDA DIFFER 
FROM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HRPO/QASMC.  It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to report any unanticipated problem to the FDA as 
follows:  
 
 Report any unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences associated with 
use of the drug (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have 
been caused by the drug) by telephone or fax no later than 7 calendar days  after 
initial receipt of the information.  A life-threatening adverse experience  is defined 
as any adverse drug experience that places the subject (in the view of the 
inves tigator) at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
 Report any serious, unexpected adverse experiences, as well as results from ani mal 
studies that suggest significant clinical risk within 15 calendar days  after initial 
receipt of this information.  A serious adverse drug experience  is defined as any 
adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
o A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life fu nctions)  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other experience which, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
An unexpected adverse drug experience  is defined as any adverse drug experience, 
the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current investigator 
brochure (or risk information, if an IB is not required or available).

name, regulatory coordinator name, and  statistician  
 Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, 
date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, study status, and phase of study  
 History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary o f accrual 
suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, 
error, or breach of confidentiality including start/stop dates and reason  
 Study -wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual  including numbers from 
participating sites  
 Protocol activation d ate at each participating site  
 Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years  at each 
participating site  
 Expected accrual end date  and accrual by site  
 Objectives of protocol with supporting  data and list the number of participants who 
have met each objective  
 Measures of efficacy  
 Early stopping rules with supporting data and list the number of participants who have 
met the early stopping rules  
 Summary of toxicities  at all participating sites  
 Abstract submissions/publications

Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 38 of 51 12.0 AUDITING  
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each site will be audited annually by 
Siteman Cancer Center personnel (QASMC) unless the outside institution has an auditing 
mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be aske d to send copies of all 
audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit notification will be sent to the 
Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will obtain the audit materials from the 
participating institution.  
 
Notification o f an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. 
Once accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the 
cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the resea rch team. However, if 
during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the research team will be 
asked to provide the additional charts within two working days.

14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptive Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients,  mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demographic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of thi s phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations an d the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by contingency 
tables and assessed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the signi ficance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of  Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 4 Version date: 04/16/15   Page 41 of 51 responsive status) will be used to derive an empirical critical P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tes ts which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by the total number of permutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is to determine whether any 
of these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
associat ion that would 
warrant pre -treatment testing. 
We believe that a reasonable 
cut off would be if at least 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients can be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina bas ed platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients who achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples s equenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

same clon e. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -respon ders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each group. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine  will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using 2 -samp le t-test or 
Mann -Whitney non -parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The change of total 
bone marrow DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association with both 
steady -state plasma  drug levels and response will be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA 
for repeat ed measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysi s with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a  10% difference in the 
means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases wher e the 
standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an  anticipated average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would not be sufficient to warrant application in  clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable non -
responders with  an expected standard deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

14.2.5  Description of Planned Subg roup Analyses  
 
The following subgroups (if sufficient numbers of patients) will be explored with 
respect to the primary and overall survival endpoints.  
 Age (60-69 years old vs ≥ 70 years old)  
 Cytogenetics  
 Patients with AML -associated mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1, or 
IDH2 vs those who do not have somatic variants in these genes.  
 
14.3 Sample Size  
 
We anticipate initially enrolling 25 patients at Washington University. Once we establish 
a routine exome analysis with validation and calculation of the ra te of patient -specific 
mutation clearance, we will enroll an additional 100 patients from at least 2 additional 
centers.

d Bone marrow biopsy  and aspirate  should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, and at  Day 28 ± 4 of C ycles 
1, 2, 4 and 6 for clinical disease assessment. Patients who achieve with clinical response (CRi or be tter) and are receiving 
cycles every 6 weeks, will undergo bone marrow biopsies on day 42 ± 4.  Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies 
should be performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.  Standard bone marro w 
procurement procedures will be followed for collection of the tissue. To include:  correlative studies (collected under 
HRPO # 201011766), morphologic assessment , cytogenetics and FISH at all t ime points . A skin biopsy sample ( collected 
under HRPO # 201011766) is required at pre -study, but may have been collected months or even years prior to first dose 
of decitabine.  
e On bone marrow or peripheral blood.  
f After Cycle 1 , these labs may be obtained every other week  (CBC)  or once a month (Chemistrie s) at the discretion of 
the treating physician.  
g Serum chemistries include bicarbonate, calcium, glucose, total protein, albumin, BUN, potassium, chloride, sodium, 
creatinine, total bilirubin, AST, ALT , alkaline phosphatase, and LDH . 
h Decitabine treatment will be 20 mg/m2 over a 1 -hour IV infusion on consecutive Days 1 -10 every 28 -day cycle .   The 
dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the beginning of each cycle . Patients may be premedicated 
with lorazepam, prochlorperazine, palonosetron, or ondansetron at the treating physician’s discretion.  
i Patients will be followed for  30 days following the date of the last decitabine  dose to monitor for toxicity, survival 
and response. Thereafter , the investigator or designee will record information on subsequent therapy, disease 
progression, and death, e very 6 months for 2 years after first dose of study drug or until t he patient is lost to follow -up.

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with  progressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should under go a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9.0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five conse cutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physcian.  
After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decreased to three  consecutive 
days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.  
Peripheral blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ± 
15 minutes after decitabine infusion is initiated.20

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 7 of 50 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expressio n. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular e tiology of decitabine sensitivity is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective he matopoiesis and malignant expansion of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consist s of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy or stem 
cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typically 
requir e 3-4 weeks of hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard inductio n therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many o lder AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpatient  setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 8 of 50 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS and AML 
patients (reviewed in [21]  Decitabin e is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However, 
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3 to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a c onsequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorpor ation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total genomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed , two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884 . 
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with respo nse or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine levels , and DNA

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 9 of 50 methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively assess genomic and 
pharmacologic parameters that could clinically predict p atient response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS.  Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitab ine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analysis of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typically followed with watchful -waitin g rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferase  leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated  with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately 5 -fold more 
potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might explain why 
decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro at lower doses than 
azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing activity at low doses, both agents 
have a direct cytotoxic effect  at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improved 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have noted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of th ese results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in Germany 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 10 of 50 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour  on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using decitabine  to 
treat elderly AML patients or patients with relapsed AML, and this experi ence is 
summarized below:

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by deamination by liver cytidine deaminase. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Di sappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1 µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be appro ximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients  administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With in fusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL . The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor  gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1  to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous infusion 
over 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the perce nt methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 13 of 50 was the time to blast clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they observed a co rrelation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by prolonged administration of 
decitabine. Further, that DNA methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
With exception of the peripheral blood sample coll ected on Cycle 1 Day 4, all correlative 
studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be 
concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlat ive studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study i s powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -speci fic mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and Cycle 
2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2,  
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific 
mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele frequency will be 
measured using the Illumni a MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by gene 
specific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow samples will be assessed 
pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 28 ± 4 and 
compared with patient specific skin sampl es (normal control). The velocity of response 
will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific mutation allele frequency 
clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 14 of 50 allele frequency in a bone marrow sa mple. The velocity and depth of tumor response 
will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is asso ciated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  
This second ana lysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 
1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expressi on signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state plasma decitabine concentration on Cycle 1  Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achi evement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 20 of 50 5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
5.1 Summary of Study Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, biomarker study of patients with AML or MDS 
who are treated with 10 consecutive days of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded from 
this trial, bec ause other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment of FAB -M3 acute 
promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < 60 years old and have not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative poss ibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  Patients will also provide peripheral 
blood sampl es on Cycle 1 Day 4 ± 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.  See Section 8.0 for details  
on correlative studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on a ctual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days every 6 weeks,  to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count 
recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days in 6  week cycles, at the discretion of the treating physician.   After 
two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further 
be decrea sed to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly inf luence therapeutic decisions made by the treating physician. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.

5.4 Concomitant Therapy  and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.4.1 Chem otherapy  
 
Patients cannot receive any chemotherapy within 21 days of study enrollment and 
must have recovered from any treatment -related toxicities. However, p atients may 
be receiv ing hydrea at enroll ment  and may continue on hydrea through Cycle 2 of 
decitabine. An indication for hydrea following  2 cycles of decitabine is evidence 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 24 of 50 that the patient is not responding and decitabine should be discontinued . Other than 
decitabine , patients cannot receive ch emotherapy during this trial.  
 
5.4.2 Growth Factors  
 
Erythroid growth factors  should not be routinely administered to patients during the 
study.  
 
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists  should not be routinely administered to patients 
during the study.  
 
Filgrastim  (G-CSF)  or sargramostim (GM -CSF)  may be administered to patients 
with septic shock or febrile neutropenia at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
5.4.3 Transfusions  
 
 Packed red blood cells  (RBCs)  transfusion :   
RBC transfusions will be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
 
 Platelet transfusion :   
Platelet transfusions will be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician   
5.4.4 Prophylactic Antimicrobial Agents  
 
Antimicrobial agents wi ll be administered at the discretion of the treating physician.

5.4.5 Radiotherapy  
 
Patients cannot receive radiotherapy within 14 days prior to study enro llment or 
while on study.  
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 25 of 50 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias  are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or delays for 
cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfun ction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to b elow the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bil irubin, ALT and AST are below 
the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment should 
be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be reintroduced with 
a 50% dose reduc tion, or at full dose at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as 
defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for 
ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  to limit 
myelosuppressive  toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles at 
six week intervals, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days of 
treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of CR with complete 
cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may further be decrease d to 
three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician .

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 26 of 50 7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine is an antimetabolite that can replac e cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine activity has not been determined 
and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by correcting 
DNA methylation, a major mechanism f or gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation  occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparation  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxycyti dine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconstituted solution should be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless used 
within 15 minutes of reconstitution, the diluted solution must be prepa red using 
cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 degrees 
F) for a maximum of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be administered either as an inpatient or an outp atient.  
 
7.1.2 Supplier  
 
Decitabine is available commercially.

Bone marrow samples  will be collected pre-study , on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, and on Day 28  ± 4 of 
Cycle 1 , 2, 4, and 6  for correlative studies. Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . The bone 
marrow samples will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Fac tors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be concurrently 
enrolled in.  
 
Skin biopsy sample  will be collected as part of the patient’s participation in HRPO# 201011766 
(“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Malignancies”). 
There is no required time  frame for this  sample , and it may have been collected months or even 
years prior to the first dose of decitabine.  
 
Peripheral blood sample  (3 mL) will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 4 ± 1.  Sample must be obtained 
45 minutes ± 15 minutes after beginning the infusion, before the decitabine infusion is complete, 
and should be obtained from the opposite arm as the infusion.  T he sample should be collected in 
a 3 mL K3EDTA tube pre -loaded with 8 mcL of tetrahydrouridine (THU 500 mcg/mL), an

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 28 of 50 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response  according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any per sistence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be bas ed on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dy splastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be independent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as  morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood c ount recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may 
also be considered a partial remissi on.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typically a greater than 50% increase compared w ith baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy to access for progressive d isease .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered relapse. 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 29 of 50 If there are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone 
marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.

x 109/L, Neutrophils > 1.0 x 109/L, and 0% blasts. Persistent dysplasia does not exclude 
CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the definition 
of CR ab ove.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a decrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, SD, 
PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts (for 
patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for patients 
with l0 -20% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts (for patients with 20 -
30% blasts at baseline only) or any of the following:  At least 50% decrement from 
maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets, reduction in Hgb by ≥ 2 g/dL,

 Hgb increase by ≥ 1.5 g/dL  
 Relevant reduction of units of RBC transfusions by an absolute number of at 
least 4 RBC transfusions/8 wk compared with the pretreatment transfusion 
number in the previous 8 wk. Only RBC transfusions given for a Hgb of ≤ 9.0 
g/dL pretreatment will count in  the RBC transfusion response evaluation

characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 related or possibly relate d to participation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, 
experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the 
research); and  
 suggests that the resear ch places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
10.3 Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  failure to follow any applicable regulation or institutional policies that govern 
human subjects research or failure to follow the determinations of the

team’s control. Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular situation.  
 
Local IRB Pre-approval of all protocol exception s must be obtained prior to the event.   For 
secondary sites, the Washington University PI will issue approval of the exception, but it 
must also be submitted to the local IRB with documentation of approval forwarded to 
Washington University.  HRPO approval  is not required for protocol exceptions occurring 
at secondary sites.  
 
10.6 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) and the Quality 
Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) at Washington 
University:  
 
The PI is required to promptly notify the IRB of the following events:

10.9 Reporting to the FDA  
 
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  
PLEASE NOTE THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FDA DIFFER 
FROM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HRPO/QASMC.  It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to report any unanticipated problem to the FDA as 
follows:  
 
 Report any unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences associated with 
use of the drug (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have 
been caused by the drug) by telephone or fax no later than 7 calendar days  after 
initial receipt of the information.  A life-threatening adverse experience  is defined 
as any adverse drug experience that places the subject (in the view of the 
inves tigator) at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
 Report any serious, unexpected adverse experiences, as well as results from ani mal 
studies that suggest significant clinical risk within 15 calendar days  after initial 
receipt of this information.  A serious adverse drug experience  is defined as any 
adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
o A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other experience which, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
An unexpected adverse drug experience  is defined as any adverse drug experience, 
the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current investigator 
brochure (or risk information, if an IB is not required or available).

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 37 of 50 12.0 AUDITING  
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each site will be audited annually by 
Siteman  Cancer Center personnel (QASMC) unless the outside institution has an auditing 
mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be asked to send copies of all 
audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit notification will  be sent to the 
Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will obtain the audit materials from the 
participating institution.  
 
Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. 
Once accrual numb ers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the 
cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the research team. However, if 
during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the re search team will be 
asked to provide the additional charts within two working days.

Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 39 of 50 14.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS METHODS AND SAMPLE SI ZE 
 
14.1 Analysis Populations  
 
Intent -to-Treat  - The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all patients wh o 
receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all patients 
who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specif ic mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine  will be described by contingency 
tables and assessed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SA M). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is  known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 3 Version date: 11/13/14   Page 40 of 50 responsive status) will be used to derive an empirical critical P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value tha n 
the original test divided by the total number of permutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients a re each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is t o determine whether any 
of these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
association that would 
warrant pre -treatment testing. 
We believe that a reasonable 
cut off would be if at least 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics (e.g. 
DNMT3A mutation or loss of 
DNMT3A expression). In 
addition, we expect that the 
majority of the enrolled 125 
patients  can be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will be 
acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rat e (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and  the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients w ho achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95%  confidence 
interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response  will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each gro up. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state plasma  decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured 
and correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of deci tabine with response will be assessed using 2 -sample t -test or 
Mann -Whitney non -parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The change of total 
bone marrow DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association with both 
steady -state plasma  drug levels and resp onse will be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor cl earance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will de crease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard 
deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between 45 evaluable respo nders and 55 evaluable non -
responders with an expected standard deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnost ic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabi ne 
administration may be decreased to 20 mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days every 6 weeks, to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  and improve count recovery . After 2 cycles at 6 week intervals, the dose may be 
reduce to 20 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days  in 6 week cycles, at the discretion of the treating 
physcian.  After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the definition of CR 
with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration may further be decreased to 
three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.  
Peripheral blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ± 
15 minutes after decitabine infusion is initiated.20

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 7 of 51 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1 ) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide 
further therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expressio n. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical 
trials, it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the 
majority of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular e tiology of decitabine 
sensitivity is unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a 
priori or even within one month of starting therapy.  
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective hematopoiesis and malignant expansion of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or 
related to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy.  Current 
therapy for AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by consolidation 
chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates 
may be as high as 60% for patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g.  
t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 year s old and with relapsed 
disease remain poor with 2 year survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available 
treatment f or MDS has been symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in 
producing sustained improvement in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 
7].  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in  elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typically 
require 3 -4 weeks of hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively  healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, 
induction mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction 
therapy ,[8-11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an 
additional 30% of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not 
offered traditional intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More 
effective and less toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant 
proportion of elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML 
patients . It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpatient  
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 8 of 51 setting , and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has 
been of CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS 
and AML patients (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] 
However, decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 
consecutive days  (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during  at least 2 
cycles of replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with 
increasing the number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive 
days has improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, 
sometimes requiring 3  to 5 cycles befo re maximum response is observed. [2] As a 
consequence, many p atients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, 
before determining resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response to 
decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabin e 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total genomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884.  
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, 
somatic mutations in AML and MDS patients in four gen es that are involved in 
methylcytosine regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, 
nearly half of all AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  
DNMT3A mutations are associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of 
mutations in one or more of these genes is associated with response or res istance to 
decitabine.  
 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 9 of 51 In th is study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine 
schedule. [3] We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response 
with mutation status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine 
levels , and DNA methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively 
assess genomic and pharmacologic parameters that could clinically predict p atient 
response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent ge nomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same 
genes , shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation 
evolution .[39, 40] Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, 
even when the morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and 
track the rate of clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has be en 
shown to have efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining 
analysis of AML and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are 
excluded because these patients are typically followed with watchful -waitin g rather than 
with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferase leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of 
methylation and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately 5 -
fold more potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might 
explain why decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro at lower 
doses than azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing activity at low doses, 
both agents have a direct cytotoxic effect at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose 
of 15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated 
improved outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive 
care alone. [15]  However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of 
note, 18% o f the patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the 
current WHO criteria for AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a 
variety of low -dose decitabine regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -
49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons of multiple low dose schedules have noted 
improved efficacy in the MDS population using a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -
day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we have recently explored this dosing 
schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an 
overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  44% of patients achiev ed stable disease 
during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this study, we noted that decitabine  does not 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 10 of 51 act quickly and the median time to response was 3 months. These results are similar to 
the recently published experience in Germany treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 
hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]  
 
A recent study using a prolon ged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  
These results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using 
decitabine  to treat  elderly AML patients or patients with relapsed AML, and this 
experience is summarized below:

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderl y AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and 
bacteremia in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 11 of 51 result, death is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of t herapy, occurring in 15 -17% of 
patients, and most commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease 
and the rapy.[16, 52, 55 ] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical 
patients  treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued 
improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]   
 
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution 
phase with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-
35 minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to 
rapid inactivation of decitabine by deamination by liver cytidine deaminase. [23] 
Total bo dy clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 
mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tum ors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Disappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1  µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in 
the initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second pha se (t ½β). The area under 
the plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, 
with a peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.44 0.1 µg/mL), while mean 
volume of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 
mL/min/kg, respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 
of 2 patients administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the 
plasma of patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), R ivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an 
infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentra tions of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were 
achieved. [59]  The steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 
1 mg/kg/h was estimated to be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the 
infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% 
to 0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose 
or plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% 
of the administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL 
(1.27 to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour 
period. [61] The range of concentr ations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -
hour period  was 0.41 -16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 12 of 51 concentrations are in the same range as the in vitro concentrations that activated 
the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor 
patients dosed with 30 mg/m²/day an d 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous 
infusion over 72 hours. [62]  
 
Summary of published steady state serum levels are below and are in proportion to 
infusion rate  (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001) :[63]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10 -day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 13 of 51 prolonged exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast 
divisions exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar 
regiment give n as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) 
was much improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were 
primarily myeloid suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding 
complications associated with leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic 
suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al noted that the perce nt methylcytosine 
reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as was the time to blast clearance (50% of 
patients who ultimately achieved a CR had ≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle 
vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, like Shen et al , they observed a 
correlation between the extent of methylcytosine reduction and response. [28]  
This study suggests that improvement in response rates and time to response can 
be achieved by prolonged administration of decitabine. Further, that DNA 
methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with prolonged exposure to decitabine 
and that this might be a patient -specific biological marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They 
noted similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving 
cytarabine + daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
With exception of the peripheral blood sample collected on Cycle 1 Day 4, all correlative 
studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be 
concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations with 
response (especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is 
powered to identify mutations with >80% sensitivity t o predict decitabine response if 
used as a clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and 
Cycle 2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN1 1, KIT, SMC3, 
PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 14 of 51 specific mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele 
frequency will be measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA 
capture by gene  specific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow samples 
will be assessed pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 
28 ± 4 and compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The 
velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest 
patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and 
depth of tumor response will  be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending  on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are 
incorrect.  This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude the se false 
positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 
± 1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state plasma decitabine concentration on Cycle 1  Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using 
LC-MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expre ssion signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 20 of 51 5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
5.1 Summary of Stu dy Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, biomarker study of patients with AML or 
MDS who are treated with 10 consecutive days of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded 
from this trial, because other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment  of FAB -M3 
acute promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < 60 years old and have not 
received cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy 
offers a curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopen ias are also 
excluded because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  Patients will also provide peripheral 
blood samples on Cycl e 1 Day 4 ± 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.  See Section 8.0 for 
details  on correlative studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 
1-10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual pati ent weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to five 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the 
definition of CR with complete cytogen etic response as defined in Section 9 .0, 
administration  may further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the 
discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results t o 
the treating physician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not antic ipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by the treating physician. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized  medicine can be 
realized.

5.2.11  Post-study Follow -up 
 
Patients are to be followed according to standard patient care procedures for 30 
days following the date of the last decitabine  dose to monitor for toxicity, 
survival , and response. Thereafter, the investigator or designee will record 
information on subsequent therapy, disease progression, and/or death every 6 
months for 2 years after last dose of study drug or until the patient is lost to 
follow -up or dies.  
 
5.3 Duration o f Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for disconti nuation 
documented in the case report forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
 Documented and confirmed disease progression  
 Death  
 Adverse event(s)  that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug  
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
 Suspected pregnancy  
 Serious non -compliance with the study protocol  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Patient withdraws consent  
 Investigator removes the patient from study  
 The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar.  
 
5.4 Concomitant Therapy  and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.4.1 Chem otherapy  
 
Patients cannot receive any chemotherapy within 21 days of study enrollment and 
must have recovered  from any treatment -related toxicities. However, p atients may 
be receiv ing hydrea at enrollment  and may continue on hydrea through Cycle 2 of 
decitabine. An indication for hydrea following  2 cycles of decitabine is evidence 
that the patient is not respondi ng and decitabine should be discontinued . Other 
than decitabine , patients cannot receive chemotherapy during this trial.

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 24 of 51  
5.4.2 Growth Factors  
 
Erythroid growth factors  should not be routinely administered to patients during 
the study.  
 
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists  should not be routinely administered to patients 
during the study.  
 
Filgrastim (G -CSF)  or sargramostim (GM -CSF)  may be administered to patients 
with septic shock or febrile neutropenia at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
5.4.3 Transfusions  
 
 Packed red blood cells  (RBCs)  transfusion :   
RBC transfusions will be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
 
 Platelet transfusion :   
Platelet transfusions will be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician   
5.4.4 Prophylactic Antimicrobial Agents  
 
Antimicrobial agents will be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  Common antimicrobial prophylaxis during cycles 1 and 2 include 
acyclovir, ciprofloxacin, and fluconazole.  
 
5.4.5 Radiotherapy  
 
Patients cannot receive ra diotherapy within 14 days prior to study enrollment or 
while on study.  
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 25 of 51 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two 
cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of 
therapy without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or 
delays for cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next 
dose of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per 
week.  Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST 
are below the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment 
should be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be 
reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 20 
mg/m2/day for ten consecutive days, and the cycles may be administered every 6 weeks  
to limit myelosuppressive toxicity , at the discretion of the  treating physician. After two 
cycles at six week intervals, the dose may be reduced to 20 mg/m2/day for five 
consecutive days of treatment  in six week intervals . If the patient meets the definition of 
CR with complete cyt ogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration  may 
further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician .

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 26 of 51 7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine is an antimetabolite that can replace  cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine activity has not been 
determined and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by 
correcting DNA methylation, a major mechanism fo r gene expression. In some cancer 
cells, hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes u nregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs  early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms 
for decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent  induction of gene expression, and degradation 
of DNA methyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparation  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconstituted solution should be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/ mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless 
used within 15 minutes of reconstitution, the diluted solution must be prepared 
using cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 
degrees F) for a maximum of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be administered either as an inpatient or an outpatient .  
 
7.1.2 Supplier  
 
Decitabine is available commercially.  
 
7.1.3 Toxicities

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 28 of 51 8.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES SAMPLE COLLECTIONS  
 
Bone marrow samples  will be collected pre-study , on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, and on Day 28  ± 4 of 
Cycle 1 , 2, 4, and 6  for correlative studies. Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . The 
bone marrow samples will be collected under  HRPO# 201011 766 (“Tissue Acquisition for 
Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be 
concurrently enrolled in.  
 
Skin biopsy sample  will be collected as part of the patient’s participation in HRPO# 201011766 
(“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic 
Malignancies”). There is no required time  frame for this  sample , and it may have been collected 
months or even years prior to the first dose of decitabine.  
 
Peripheral blood sample  (3 mL) will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 4 ± 1.  Sample must be 
obtained 45 minutes ± 15 minutes after beginning the infusion, before the decitabine infusion is 
complete, and should be obtained from the opposite arm as the infusion.  The sample should be 
collected in a 3 mL K3EDTA tube pre -loaded with 8 mcL of tetrahydrouridine (THU 500 
mcg/mL), an inhibitor of cytidine deaminase .  The sample should be processed by the Tissue 
Procurement Core Facility at the Siteman Cancer Center.  Plasma should be separated and stored 
per protocols.

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 29 of 51 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for respon se according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of 
mild megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts,  dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   
In addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be 
independent of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined  as morphologic complete remission 
plus a reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete bloo d count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined 
as morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in 
the bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present 
may also be considered a partial remissi on.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typically a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell coun t to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy to access for progressive disease .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% b lasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 30 of 51 relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone 
marrow, bone marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm re lapse.  
 
9.2 Response Criteria  - MDS  
 
MDS Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:69

cell lines in the bone marrow and peripheral blood values of Hgb > 11g/dL, Platelets > 
100 x 109/L, Neutrophils > 1.0 x 109/L, and 0% blasts. Persistent dysplasia does not 
exclude CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow  Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the 
definition of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a de crease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, 
SD, PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts 
(for patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for 
patie nts with l0 -20% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts (for patients 
with 20 -30% blasts at baseline only) or any of the following: At least 50% decrement 
from maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets, reduction in Hgb by ≥ 2 
g/dL, or New or worsened transfusion dependence not related to study drug toxicity . Or

HgB <11 g/dL):  
 Hgb increase by ≥ 1.5 g/dL  
 Relevant reduction of units of RBC transfusions by an absolute number of at 
least 4 RBC transfusions/8 wk compared with the pretreatment transfusion 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 31 of 51 number in the previous 8 wk. Only RBC transfusions given for a Hgb of ≤ 9.0 
g/dL pretreatment will count in  the RBC transfusion response evaluation  
 
Platelet response requires one of the following (only required if pretreatment 
platelets < 100 x 109/L):

Complete Cytogenetic Response  – Defined as  reversion to a normal karyotype. 
For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is defined as no clonal 
abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  Progressive disease as 
defin ed above nullif ies cytogenetic response.  
 
9.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease  
 
Bone marrow biopsy should be performed on Day 28  ± 4 of cycle s 1, 2, 4  and 6 for

Local IRB Pre-approval of all protocol exception s must be obtained prior to the event.   
For secondary sites, the Washington University PI will issue approval of the exception, 
but it must also be submitted to the local IRB with documentation of approval forwarded 
to Washington University.  HRPO approval  is not required for protocol exceptions 
occurring at secondary sites.  
 
10.6 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) and the Quality 
Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) at Washington 
University:  
 
The PI is required to promptly not ify the IRB of the following events:

of the study.  
 Noncompliance with federal regulations or t he requirements or determinations of 
the IRB.  
 Receipt of new information that may impact the willingness of participants to 
participate or continue participation in the research study.  
 
These events must be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the occurrence of 
the event or notification to the PI of the event.   The death of a research participant that 
qualifies as a reportable event should be reported within 1 working day  of the occurrence 
of the event or notification to the PI of the event.  
 
10.7 Reporting Requirements for Secondary Sites  
 
The research team at each secondary site is required to promptly notify the Washington

10.9 Reporting to the FDA  
 
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  
PLEASE NOTE THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FDA DIFFER 
FROM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HRPO/QASMC.  It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to report any unanticipated problem to the FDA as 
follows:  
 
 Report any unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences associated 
with use of the drug (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may 
have been caused by the drug) by telephone or fax no later than 7 calendar days  
after initial receipt of the information.  A life-threatening adverse experience  is 
defined as any adverse drug experience that places the subject (in the view of the 
inves tigator) at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it 
does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
 Report any serious, unexpected adverse experiences, as well as results from 
animal studies that suggest significant clinical risk within 15 calendar days  after 
initial receipt of this information.  A serious adverse drug experience  is defined as 
any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following ou tcomes:  
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
o A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life fu nctions)  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other experience which, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
An unexpected adverse drug experience  is defined as any adverse drug 
experience, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current 
investigator brochure (or risk information, if an IB is not required or available).

name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
 Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, 
date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, study status, and phase of 
study  
 History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual 
suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol 
exceptions, error, or breach of confidentiality including  start/stop dates and reason  
 Study -wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual  including numbers from 
participating sites  
 Protocol activation d ate at each participating site  
 Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years  at each 
participating site  
 Expected accrual end date  and accrual by site  
 Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number of participants who 
have met each objective

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 38 of 51 12.0 AUDITING  
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each site will be audited annually by 
Siteman Cancer Center personnel (QASMC) unless the outside institution has an auditing 
mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be asked to send copies of all 
audit materials, including source documentation.  The audit notification will be sent to the 
Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will obtain the audit materials from 
the participating institutio n. 
 
Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. 
Once accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the 
cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be  sent to the research team. However, if 
during the audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the research team will be 
asked to provide the additional charts within two working days.

14.1 Analysis Populations  
 
Intent -to-Treat  - The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be defined as all patients wh o 
receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all 
patients who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
14.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
14.2.1  Descriptive Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuat ion, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of pati ents, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demographic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
14.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point o f this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by contingency 
tables and assessed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responde rs and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of 
other demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant cri tical P values will 
be corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be 
too conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 41 of 51 responsive status) will be used to derive an empirical critical P value.  T he new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value 
than the original test divided by the total number of permutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association 
between mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, 
IDH1/2, and TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% 
and 30% in multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable 
differences of response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an 
expected overall 45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% 
frequency of a mutated gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power 
to detect 30% difference at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is 
to determine whether any of 
these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
association that would 
warrant pre -treatment 
testing. We believe that a 
reasonable cut off wo uld be 
if at least 30% of clinical 
response could be attributed 
to the presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT 3A 
expression). In addition, we 
expect that the majority of the enrolled 125 patients can be used in the analysis 
(since all of our molecular information will be acquired within 30 days of 
enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
14.2.3  Seconda ry Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients who achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs p er case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date 
with whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

Amendment 2 Version date: 09/11/14   Page 42 of 51 interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipa ted standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with 
clinical response will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated 
measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -
group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as 
well as the between -time differences within each group. The resultant critical P 
values will also be corrected using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state plasma  decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured 
and correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously  published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assessed using 2 -sample t -test or 
Mann -Whitney non -parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The chan ge of total 
bone marrow DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association with both 
steady -state plasma  drug levels and response will be assessed using 2 -way 
ANOVA for repeated measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple 
comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) 
and between -time differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the 
correlation of expression profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analy sis was performed using two -
sample t -test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over 
time. For tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% 
difference in the means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or m ore 
variants, and > 98% power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more 
variants per clone with α = 0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, 
respectively, in cases where the standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we 
have observe d thus far). For p harmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% 
power to determine a 25 ng/ml difference between the average C max of 45 
evaluable responders and 55 evaluable non -responders with an anticipated 
average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard deviation of 40 ng/ml with in the entire 
cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a less significant difference would not 
be sufficient to warrant application in clinical decision making (i.e. whether to 
continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We anticipate 99% power to determine a 
difference of 20% in the reduction of bone  marrow methylcytosine between 45 
evaluable responders and 55 evaluable non -responders with an expected standard 
deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] The difference in methylcytosine 
reduction previously observed wa s 30% between patients achieving CR/PR and 
those with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients ac hieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to five consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity at the 
discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient 
meets the definition of CR with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration 
may further be decreased to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and at Day 28  ± 4 of Cycles 
1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician to assess for relapse or progression.  
Peripher al blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ± 
15 minutes after decitabine infusion is initiated.20

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide 
further therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expressio n. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical 
trials, it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the 
majority of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular e tiology of decitabine 
sensitivity is unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a 
priori or even within one month of starting therapy.  
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective he matopoiesis and malignant expansion of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or 
related to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current 
therapy for AML consist s of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by consolidation 
chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates 
may be as high as 60% for patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. 
t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed 
disease remain poor with 2 year survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available 
treatment for MDS has been symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in 
producing sustained improvement in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 
7].  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in  elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typically 
require 3 -4 weeks of hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively  healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, 
induction mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction 
therapy ,[8-11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an 
additional 30% of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not 
offered traditional intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More 
effective and less toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant 
proportion of elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine  has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML 
patients . It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpatient  
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 setting , and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has 
been of CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS 
and AML patients (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] 
However, decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 
consecutive days  (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during  at least 2 
cycles of replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with 
increasing the number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive 
days has improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, 
sometimes requiring 3  to 5 cycles befo re maximum response is observed. [2] As a 
consequence, many p atients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, 
before determining resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response to 
decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabin e 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total genomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884.  
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, 
somatic mutations in AML and MDS patients in four gen es that are involved in 
methylcytosine regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, 
nearly half of all AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  
DNMT3A mutations are associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of 
mutations in one or more of these genes is associated with response or res istance to 
decitabine.  
 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 In th is study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine 
schedule. [3] We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response 
with mutation status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine 
levels , and DNA methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively 
assess genomic and pharmacologic parameters that could clinically predict p atient 
response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same 
genes , shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared p atterns of mutation 
evolution .[39, 40] Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hemat opoiesis, 
even when the morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and 
track the rate of clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been 
shown to have efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining 
analysis of AML and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are 
excluded because these patients are typically followed with watchful -waitin g rather than 
with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferase leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
signifi cant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of 
methylation and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately 5 -
fold more potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might 
explain why decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro at lower 
doses than azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing activity at low doses, 
both agents have a direct cytotoxic effect at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose 
of 15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated 
improved outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive 
care alone. [15]  However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of 
note, 18% o f the patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the 
current WHO criteria for AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a 
variety of low -dose decitabine regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -
49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons of multiple low dose schedules have noted 
improved efficacy in the MDS population using a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -
day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we have recently explored this dosing 
schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an 
overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  44% of patients achiev ed stable disease 
during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this study, we noted that decitabine  does not

Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 act quickly and the median time to response was 3 months. These results are similar to 
the recently published experience in Germany treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 
hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]  
 
A recent study using a prolon ged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  
These results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using 
decitabine  to treat  elderly AML patients or patients with relapsed AML, and this 
experience is summarized below:

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderl y AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and 
bacteremia in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a

 result, death is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of t herapy, occurring in 15 -17% of 
patients, and most commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease 
and the rapy.[16, 52, 55 ] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical 
patients  treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued 
improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]   
 
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution 
phase with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-
35 minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to 
rapid inactivation of decitabine by deamination by liver cytidine deaminase. [23] 
Total bo dy clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 
mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tum ors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Disappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1  µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in 
the initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second pha se (t ½β). The area under 
the plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, 
with a peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.44 0.1 µg/mL), while mean 
volume of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 
mL/min/kg, respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 
of 2 patients administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the 
plasma of patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), R ivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an 
infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentra tions of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were 
achieved. [59]  The steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 
1 mg/kg/h was estimated to be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the 
infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% 
to 0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose 
or plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% 
of the administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL 
(1.27 to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour 
period. [61] The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -
hour period  was 0.41 -16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 concentrations are in the same range as the in vitro concentrations that activated 
the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor 
patients  dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous 
infusion over 72 hours. [62]  
 
Summary of published steady state serum levels are below and are in proportion to 
infusion rate  (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001) :[63]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine  reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10 -day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 prolonged exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast 
divisions exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar 
regiment give n as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) 
was much improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were 
primarily myeloid suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding 
complications associated with leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic 
suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al noted that the perce nt methylcytosine 
reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as was the time to blast clearance (50% of 
patients who ultimately achieved a CR had ≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle 
vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, like Shen et al , they observed a 
correlation between the extent of methylcytosine reduction and response. [28]  
This study suggests that improvement in response rates and time to response can 
be achieved by prolonged administration of decitabine. Further, that DNA 
methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with prolonged exposure to decitabine 
and that this might be a patient -specific biological marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They 
noted similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving 
cytarabine + daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
With exception of the peripheral blood sample collected on Cycle 1 Day 4, all correlative 
studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be 
concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations with 
response (especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is 
powered to identify mutations with >80% sensitivity t o predict decitabine response if 
used as a clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre stud y, Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and 
Cycle 2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, 
PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -

Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 specific mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele 
frequency will be measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA 
capture by gene sp ecific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow samples 
will be assessed pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10 ± 1 , Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 
28 ± 4 and compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The 
velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the lowest 
patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and 
depth of tumor response will be  correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycl e 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on  type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typically set for greater sensitivity than 
specificity) .  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are 
incorrect.  This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false 
positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 
± 1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutat ion status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state plasma decitabine concentration on Cycle 1  Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using 
LC-MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expre ssion signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

 5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
5.1 Summary of Study Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, biomarker study of patients with AML or 
MDS who are treated with 10 consecutive days of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded 
from this trial, because other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment of FAB -M3 
acute promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < 60 years old and have not 
received cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy 
offers a curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are als o 
excluded because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 6 . Following Cycle 6, bone marrow biopsies should be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician to assess for relapse or progression . 
Patients will provide a skin biopsy sample pre -study.  Patients will also provide peripheral 
blood samples on Cycl e 1 Day 4 ± 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.  See Section 8.0 for 
details  on correlative studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 
1-10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual pati ent weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to five 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the 
definition of CR with complete cytogen etic response as defined in Section 9 .0, 
administration  may further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the 
discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results t o 
the treating physician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not antic ipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by the treating physician. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized  medicine can be 
realized.

Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 Patients are to be followed according to standard patient care procedures for 30 
days following the date of the last decitabine  dose to monitor for toxicity, 
survival , and response. Thereafter, the investigator or designee will record 
information on subsequent therapy, disease progression, and/or death every 6 
months for 2 years aft er last dose of study drug or until the patient is lost to 
follow -up or dies.  
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation 
documented in the case report forms.

must have recovered from any treatment -related toxicities. However, p atients may 
be receiv ing hydrea at enrollment  and may continue on hydrea through Cycle 2 of 
decitabine. An indication for hydrea following  2 cycles of decitabine is evidence 
that the patient is not responding and decitabine should be discontinued . Other 
than decitabine , patients cannot receive chemotherapy during this trial.  
 
5.4.2 Growth Factors  
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two 
cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias  are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of 
therapy without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or 
delays for cyt openias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfun ction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next 
dose of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked tw ice per 
week.  Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST 
are below the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment 
should be delayed until recovery to base line or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be 
reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with i ncomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 5 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the 
definition of CR with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, 
administration  may further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the 
discretion of the  treating physician .

 7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine is an antimetabolite that can replace cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine  activity has not been 
determined and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by 
correcting DNA methylation, a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer 
cells, hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor  genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor gene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (s pecifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention.  Other possible mechanisms 
for decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar to other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation 
of DNA methyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparatio n  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 1 0 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconstituted solution should be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless 
used within 15 minutes of reconstitution, the diluted solution must be prepared 
using cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 
degrees F) for a maxim um of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be administered either as an inpatient or an outpatient.

 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY A ND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors cons titute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of 
mild megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   
In addition,  ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be 
independent of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission 
plus a reversion to a normal karyo type. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined 
as morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in 
the bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present 
may also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e definitions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressi ve disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typically a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy to access for progressive disease .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripher al blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone 
marrow, bone marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.  
 
9.2 Response Criteria  - MDS  
 
MDS Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:69

exclude CR but will be noted.  
 
Marrow Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the 
definition of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above wit h a decrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, 
SD, PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progre ssive Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts 
(for patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for  
patients with l0 -20% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts (for patients 
with 20 -30% blasts at baseline only) or any of the following: At least 50% decrement 
from maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets, reduction in Hgb  by ≥ 2

least 4 RBC transfusions/8 wk compared with the pretreatment transfusion 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 number in the previous 8 wk. Only RBC transfusions given for a Hgb of ≤ 9.0 
g/dL pretreatment will count in the RBC transfusion response evaluation  
 
Platelet response requires one of the following (only required if pretreatment 
platelets < 100 x 109/L):  
 Absolute increase of ≥ 30 x 109/L (for patients starting with > 20 x 109/L 
platelets)

patie nts starting with < 20 x 109/L) 
 
Neutrophil response requires the following (only required if pretreatment ANC 
<1.0 x 109/L):  
 At least 100% increase and an absolute increase > 0.5 x 109/L 
 
9.3.1 Cytogenetic Response  
 
Complete Cytogenetic Response  – Defined as  reversion to a normal karyotype. 
For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is defined as no clonal 
abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  Progressive disease as 
defined above nullif ies cytogenetic response.  
 
9.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease  
 
Bone marrow biopsy should be performed on Day 28  ± 4 of cycle s 1, 2, 4  and 6 for

with use of the drug (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may 
have been caused by the drug) by telephone or fax no later than 7 calendar days  
after initial receipt of the information.  A life-threatening adverse experience  is 
defined as any adverse drug experience that places the subject (in the view of the 
investigator) at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it 
does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
 Report any serious, unexpected adverse experiences, as well as results from 
animal studies that suggest significant clinical risk within 15 calendar days  after 
initial receipt of this information.  A serious adverse drug experience  is defined as 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
o Inpatient hospitalization o r prolongation of existing hospitalization  
o A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other experience which, based upon ap propriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
An unexpected adverse drug experience  is defined as any adverse drug 
experience, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current 
investigator brochure (or risk information, if an IB is not required or available).

patients who receive at least one cycle of treatment.

12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
12.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
12.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by contingency 
tables and assessed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of 
other demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will 
be corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be 
too conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empirical critical P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value 
than the original test divided by the total number of permutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association 
between mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, 
IDH1/2, and TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% 
and 30% in multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable 
differences of response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an 
expected overall 45% CR/CRi  rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% 
frequency of a mutated gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power 
to detect 30% difference at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is 
to determine whether any of 
these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
association that would 
warrant pre -treatment 
testing. We believe that a 
reasonable cut off would be 
if at least 30% of clinical 
response could be attributed 
to the presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that mor e power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT3A 
expression). In addition, we 
expect that the majority of the enrolled 125 patients can be used in the analysis 
(since all of our mol ecular information will be acquired within 30 days of 
enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
12.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical contro ls[2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients who achieve a CR/CRi  after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date 
with whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

Amendment 2 Version date: 03/10/14  
 interva l of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipated standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with 
clinical response will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated 
measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -
group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as 
well as the between -time differences within each group. The resultant c ritical P 
values will also be corrected using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state plasma  decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured 
and correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of decitabine with response will be assesse d using 2 -sample t -test or 
Mann -Whitney non -parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The change of total 
bone marrow DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association with both 
steady -state plasma  drug levels and response will be assessed using 2 -way 
ANOVA for repeated measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple 
comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) 
and between -time differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the 
correlation of expression profiles a nd SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -
sample t -test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over 
time. For tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% pow er to detect a 10% 
difference in the means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or more 
variants, and > 98% power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more 
variants per clone with α = 0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, 
respectively,  in cases where the standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we 
have observe d thus far). For pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% 
power to determine a 25 ng/ml difference between the average C max of 45 
evaluable responders and 55 evaluable non -responders with an anticipated 
average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire 
cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a less significant difference would not 
be sufficient to warrant application in clinical decision making (i.e. whether to 
continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We anticipate 99% power to determine a 
difference of 20% in the reduction of bone  marrow methylcytosine between 45 
evaluable responders and 55 evaluable non -responders with an expected standard 
deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] The difference in methylcytosine 
reduction previously observed wa s 30% between patients achieving CR/PR and 
those with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

 Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) or MDS 
patients ac hieve a marrow complete response (Marrow CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine 
administration may be decreased to five consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity at the 
discretion of the  treating physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient 
meets the definition of CR with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, administration 
may further be decreased to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the discretion of the  treating physician.  
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline , at Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , at Cycle 1 Day 28  ± 4, and 
at the end of even numbered cycles . 
Peripheral blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ± 
15 minutes after decitabine infusion is initiated.20

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
5 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide 
further therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and i ntegration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete res ponses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical 
trials, it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the 
majority of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine 
sensitivity  is unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a 
priori or even within one month of starting therapy.   
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective hematopoiesis and malignant expansion of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or 
related to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy.  Current 
therapy for AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by consolidation 
chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates 
may be as high as 60% for patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g.  
t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 year s old and with relapsed 
disease remain poor with 2 year survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available 
treatment f or MDS has been symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in 
producing sustained improvement in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 
7].  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such th erapy, patients typically 
require 3 -4 weeks of hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, 
induction mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20-40% following standard induction 
therapy ,[8-11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an 
additional 30% of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not 
offered traditional intensive chemotherapy, but re ceive supportive care alone. [15]  More 
effective and less toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant 
proportion of elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML 
patients . It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the outpatient

6 setting , and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has 
been of CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS 
and AML patients (reviewed in [21]  Decit abine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] 
However, decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 
consecutive days  (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 
cycles of replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with 
increasing  the number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive 
days has improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, 
sometimes requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a 
consequence, many patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, 
before determining resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response t o 
decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total genomi c DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884.  
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, 
somatic mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in 
methylcytosine regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, 
nearly half of all AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  
DNMT3A mutations are associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of 
mutations in one or more of these genes is associated with response or resistance to 
decitabine.

7 In th is study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine 
schedule. [3] We will perform exome sequencing on all patients  and correlate response 
with mutation status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, plasma  decitabine 
levels , and DNA methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively 
assess genomic and pharmacologic parameters that could clin ically predict p atient 
response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same 
genes , shared patterns of mutation acquisiti on, and shared patterns of mutation 
evolution .[39, 40] Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, 
even when the morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and 
track the rate of clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been 
shown to have efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining 
analysis of AML and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patien ts are 
excluded because these patients are typically followed with watchful -waiting rather than 
with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferase leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of 
methylation and is associated  with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately 5 -
fold more potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might 
explain why decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro at lower 
doses than azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing activity at low doses, 
both agents have a direct cytotoxic effect  at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose 
of 15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated 
improved outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive 
care alone. [15]  However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of 
note, 18% of the patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the 
current WHO criteria for AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a 
variety of low -dose decitabine regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -
49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons of multiple low do se schedules have noted 
improved efficacy in the MDS population using a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -
day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these result s, we have recently explored this dosing 
schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an 
overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  44% of patients achiev ed stable disease 
during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this study, we noted that decitabine  does not

8 act quickly and the median time to response was 3 months. These results are similar to 
the recently published experience in Germany treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 
hours TID for 3 days eve ry 6 weeks, which resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]  
 
A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  
These results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using 
decitabine  to treat  elderly AML patients or patients with relapsed AML, and this 
experience is summarized below:

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderl y AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and 
bacteremia in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a

9 result, death is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of 
patients, and most commonly res ulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease 
and the rapy.[16, 52, 55 ] While unsettling, these numbers are better t han many historical 
patients  treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued 
improvements in therapy .[9, 12]   
 
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabol ism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution 
phase with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-
35 minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is due to 
rapid inactivation of decitabine by deamination by l iver cytidine deaminase. [23] 
Total body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of  126 
mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with adv anced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Disappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1 µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectabilit y. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in 
the initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under 
the plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, 
with a peak plas ma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.44 0.1 µg/mL), while mean 
volume of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 
mL/min/kg, respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 
of 2 patients administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC  was usually undetectable in the 
plasma of patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an 
infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were 
achieved. [59]  The steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 
1 mg/kg/h was estimated to be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the 
infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% 
to 0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose 
or plasma drug levels. High clearance va lues and a total urinary excretion of <1% 
of the administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL 
(1.27 to 1.60 µM) during the infusion  of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour 
period. [61] The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8-
hour period  was 0.41 -16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS

10 concentrations are in the same range as the in vitro concentrations that activated 
the expression of tumor suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor 
patients dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous 
infusion over 72 hours. [62]  
 
Summary of published steady state serum levels are below and are in proportion to 
infusion rate  (R2 = 0.98, p < 0.0001) :[63]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell divisi on is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10 -day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This

Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
11 prolonged exposure course was designed to incre ase the number of AML blast 
divisions exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a similar 
regiment give n as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) 
was much improved (64 % vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were 
primarily myeloid suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding 
complications associated  with leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic 
suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al noted that the percent methylcytosine 
reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as was the time to blast clearance (50% of 
patients who ultimately achieved a CR had ≤ 5% bone mar row blasts after 1 cycle 
vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, like Shen et al , they observed a 
correlation between the extent of methylcytosine reduction and response. [28]  
This study suggests that improvement in response rates and time t o response can 
be achieved by prolonged administration of decitabine. Further, that DNA 
methylcytosine reduction can be achieved with prolonged exposure to decitabine 
and that this might be a patient -specific biological marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They 
noted similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience givin g 
cytarabine + daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
With exception of the peripheral blood sample collected on Cycle 1 Day 4, all correlative 
studies will be collected under  HRPO# 201011766 (“Tissue Acquisition for Analysis of 
Genetic Progression Factors in Hematologic Diseases ”) that all patients will be 
concurrently enrolled in.  The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with resp onse to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s pre-study  bone marrow sample 
and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations wi th 
response (especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is 
powered to identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if 
used as a clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected pre study , Cycle 1 Day 10±1, Cycle 1 Day 28±4 , and 
Cycle 2 Day 28 ±4. We will assess mutations in at least 24 recurr ently mutated genes 
(including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, 
RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, 
PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all patient -

Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
12 specific mutations discov ered during exome sequencing. The leukemic allele 
frequency will be measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA 
capture by gene specific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient bone marrow samples 
will be assessed pre-study , Cycle 1 D ay 10  ± 1, Cycle 1 D ay 28 ± 4 , and Cycle 2 D ay 
28 ± 4 and compared with patient specific skin samples (normal control). The 
velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of respons e will be defined as the lowest 
patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The velocity and 
depth of tumor response will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progre ssion.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the  Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1, Cycle 1 
Day 28 ± 4, and Cycle 2 Day 28  ± 4 bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve 
to validate all exome -discovered mutations. This is important, because exome 
sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% false -discovery rate depending on type I error 
tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms are typically set for greater sensitivity than 
specific ity).  Thus, many mutations discovered during exome sequencing are 
incorrect.  This second analysis of these mutations will server to exclude these false 
positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  from pre -study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 
± 1 with response to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state plasma decitabine concentration on Cycle 1  Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 
with response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using 
LC-MS. Patients will be evaluated pre-study  and Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

17 5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
5.1 Summary of Study Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, biomarker study of patients with AML or 
MDS who are treated with 10 consecutive days of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded 
from this trial, because other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment of FAB -M3 
acute promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < 60 years old and have not 
received cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy 
offers a curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients withou t cytopenias are also 
excluded because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies pre-study,  on Cycle 1  Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycle 1 and all even number cycles. Patients will provide a skin biopsy 
sample pre -study.  Patients will also provide peripheral blood samples on Cycle 1 Day 4 ± 
1 for pharmacokinetic studies.  See Section 8.0 for details  on correlative studies .  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 
1-10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS  patients achieve a marrow complete response (Marrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to five 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the 
definition of CR with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, 
administration  may further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the 
discretion of the  treating physician . 
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of th is study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by the treating physician. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.  
 
5.2 Study Procedures  
 
5.2.1 Pre-study Procedures

5.4 Concomitant Therapy  and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.4.1 Chem otherapy  
 
Patients cannot receive any chemotherapy within 21 days of study enrollment and 
must have recovered from any treatment -related toxicities. However, p atients may 
be receiv ing hydrea at enrollment  and may continue on hydrea through Cycle 2 of 
decitabine. An indication for hydrea following  2 cycles of decitabine is evidence 
that the patient is not responding and decitabine should be discontinued . Other 
than decitabine , patients cannot receive chemotherapy during this trial.  
 
5.4.2 Growth Factors  
 
Erythroid growth factors  should not be routinely administered to patients during 
the study.

Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
22 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
A criterion for discontinuation of the study is a delay of > 8 weeks between any two 
cycles.  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML and MDS, their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of 
therapy without adjustment for any cytopenia.  Following Cycle 4, dose modifications or 
delays for cytopenias will be made at the discretion of the investigator .  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next 
dose of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per 
week.  Decitabine can be resumed at full dose when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST 
are below the limits listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities  related to decitabine , decitabine treatment 
should be delayed until recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. Decitabine may be 
reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at full dose at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  for Treatment Response  
 
Once AML patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi)  or MDS patients achieve a marrow complete response (M arrow 
CR) as defined in Section 9 .0, decitabine administration may be decreased to 5 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity  at the discretion of the  treating 
physician. After two cycles of five consecutive days of treatment, if the patient meets the 
definition of CR with complete cytogenetic response as defined in Section 9 .0, 
administration  may further be decrease d to three  consecutive days per cycle  at the 
discretion of the  treating physician .

23 7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine is an antimetabolite that can replace cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine activity has not been 
determined and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by 
correcting DNA methylation, a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer 
cells, hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor g ene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms 
for decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar t o other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation 
of DNA methyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparation  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconstituted solution should be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless 
used within 15 minutes of r econstitution, the diluted solution must be prepared 
using cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 
degrees F) for a maximum of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be administered either as an inpatient or an outpatient.  
 
7.1.2 Supplier  
 
Decitabine is available commercially.  
 
7.1.3 Toxicities

26 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY A ND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  - AML  
 
AML Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors cons titute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of 
mild megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   
In addition,  ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be 
independent of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission 
plus a reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incompl ete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined 
as morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Defined as meeting the above criteria for complete remission, 
with the followin g exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in 
the bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present 
may also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting th e defin itions of CR, CRi, PR, PD , or 
recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive disease  (PD) – Defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, 
typically a greater than 50% increase compared with baseline , or new extramedullary 
disease . Patients with a  > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the 
total peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy to access for progressive disease .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Defined as relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone 
marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes is considered 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
27 relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripher al blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone 
marrow, bone marrow biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.  
 
9.2 Response Criteria  - MDS  
 
MDS Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:69 
 
Complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all 
cell lines in the bone marrow and peripheral blood values of Hgb > 11g/dL, Platelets > 
100 x 109/L, Neutrophils > 1.0 x 109/L, and 0% blasts. Persistent dysplasia does not 
exclude CR but will be noted.  
 
Marro w Complete Response ( Marrow CR) – Defined as < 5% myeloblasts in the bone 
marrow and a decrease by > 50% from pretreatment values, but not meeting the 
definition of CR above.  
 
Partial Remission ( PR) – Defined as meeting the definition of CR above with a d ecrease 
of myeloeblasts in the bone marrow by > 50% from pretreatment values, but absolute 
myeloblasts still >5%.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) – Defined as not meeting the definitions of CR, Marrow CR, PR, 
SD, PD, or recurrence/morphologic relapse.   
 
Progressive  Disease//Relapse  (PD) – Defined as ≥ 50% increase in blasts to > 5% blasts 
(for patients with less than 5% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts 
(for patients with 5 -10% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts (for 
patients with l0 -20% blasts at baseline only), ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts (for patients 
with 20 -30% blasts at baseline only) or any of the following: At least 50% decrement 
from maximum remission/response in granulocytes or platelets, reduction in Hgb by ≥ 2 
g/dL, or New or worse ned transfusion dependence not related to study drug toxicity . Or

 Relevant reduction of units of RBC transfusions by an absolute number of at 
least 4 RBC transfusions/8 wk compared with the pretreatment transfu sion 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
28 number in the previous 8 wk. Only RBC transfusions given for a Hgb of ≤ 9.0 
g/dL pretreatment will count in the RBC transfusion response evaluation  
 
Platelet response requires one of the following (only required if pretreatment 
platelets < 100 x 109/L):

12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
12.2.1  Descriptiv e Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for  demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demograph ic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
12.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by contingency 
tables and assessed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of 
other demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will 
be corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be 
too conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Amendment 1 Version date: 10/29/2013  
35 responsive status) will be u sed to derive an empirical critical P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value 
than the original test divided by the total number of permutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association 
between mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, 
IDH1/2, and TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% 
and 30% in multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable 
differences of response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an 
expected overall 45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% 
frequency of a mutated gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power 
to detect 30% difference at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is 
to determine whether any of 
these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
association that would 
warrant pre -treatment 
testing. We believe that a 
reasonable cut off would be 
if at least 30% of clinical 
response could be attributed 
to the presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT3A 
expression). In addition, we 
expect that the majority of the enrolled 125 patients c an be used in the analysis 
(since all of our molecular information will be acquired within 30 days of 
enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or less).  
 
12.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date 
with whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

36 interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipated standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with 
clinical response will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated 
measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -
group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as 
well as the between -time differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P 
values will also be corrected using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state plasma  decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured 
and correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
plasma  levels of deci tabine with response will be assessed using 2 -sample t -test or 
Mann -Whitney non -parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The change of total 
bone marrow DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association with both 
steady -state plasma  drug levels and resp onse will be assessed using 2 -way 
ANOVA for repeated measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple 
comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) 
and between -time differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the 
correlation of expression profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -
sample t -test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over 
time. For tumor cl earance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% 
difference in the means at two separate time points for clones with 6 or more 
variants, and > 98% power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more 
variants per clone with α = 0.05 (power will de crease to 91% and 82%, 
respectively, in cases where the standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we 
have observe d thus far). For pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% 
power to determine a 25 ng/ml difference between the average C max of 45 
evaluable responders and 55 evaluable non -responders with an anticipated 
average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard deviation of 40 ng/ml within the entire 
cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a less significant difference would n ot 
be sufficient to warrant application in clinical decision making (i.e. whether to 
continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We anticipate 99% power to determine a 
difference of 20% in the reduction of bone marrow methylcytosine between 45 
evaluable respo nders and 55 evaluable non -responders with an expected standard 
deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] The difference in methylcytosine 
reduction previously observed was 30% between patients achieving CR/PR and 
those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Phase of development  Phase II 
Study objectives  Primary:   
- To determine whether patient -specific mutations correlate with clinical 
overall response to decitabine in patients with AML or MDS.  
Secondary:   
- To determine whether 10 consecutive days per cycle of decitabine 
improves outcomes compared with historical controls  treated with 5 
consecutive days per cycle of decitabine . 
- To determine whether other biomarkers correlate with clinical overall 
response to decitabine in patients with AML or MDS. The se will include: 
velocity and depth of patient -specific mutation clearance, bone marrow 
expression profile and change in expression profile during decitabine 
treatment, steady -state serum decitabine concentrations, and decrease in 
bone marrow methylcytosin e content in response to decitabine.

Expected number of 
patients  Total: 125.  
Evaluable for all molecular studies: 100.  
Enrollment time -table: 25 patients will be enrolled initially at Washington 
University. Once the molecular pipeline for routine exome analysis is 
established, at least 2 additional sites will be added.  
Study drug formulation 
and administration  Decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deox ycytidine) is a lyophilized white powder available 
for injection in 20 -mL single -use vials containing 50 mg of drug. The 
product should be stored at room temperature. Prior to use, the test product is 
reconstituted in 10 mL of sterile water for injection. The reconstituted 
concentrate is further diluted with cold infusion solution to obtain a final 
concentration of decitabine of between 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL.  
 
All patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2 given as a 1 hour continuous 
IV infusion on consecutive days 1 -10 of each cycle ; the dose should be 
calculated based on actual body weight at the beginning of each cycle .  
 
Once patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete 
blood count recovery (CRi)  (morphologic leukemia -free state, defined as less 
than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of  ≥ 200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods, no persistence of 
extramedullary disease, and no persistent pre -treatment morphologic 
abnormalities, such as pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, or 
dysplastic megakaryocytes) administration may be decreased to 5 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity, per treating physician. 
After two cycles with bone marrow blast count s < 5% and no evidence of 
disease by cytogenetics or immunophenotype, patients may further decrease 
therapy to 3 consecutive days per cycle, per treating physician.  
Each cycle will be 28 ± 4 days.  
Duration of treatment  Treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
 Death,  
 Disease progression  (as defined in 3.7.1.3),  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
  Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating 
physician.  
Correlative studies  Bone marrow samples for correlative studies will be collected prestudy, on 
Cycle 1 day 10 ± 1 and day 28 ± 4, and on day 28 ± 4 of subsequent even 
numbered cycles.  
Peripheral blood samples for correlative studies will be collected  on Cycle 1 
day 4 ± 1.   
 
1. Identify Patient -specific mutations  
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s day 0 bone 
marrow sample and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -
associated variants, defined as variants found in the bone marrow 
sample and not in the skin sample. We will correlate the presence of 
mutations with overall response.  
2. Velocity and depth of response.  
We will assess the rate of tumor clearance by measuring the allele 
frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone marrow samples 
during cycles 1 and 2. We will assess mutations in at least 24 
recur rently mutated genes (including, but not limited to: FLT3, 
DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, 
U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all 
patient -specific mutations disco vered during exome sequencing. The 
leukemic allele frequency will be measured using the Illumnia 
MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by gene specific 
biotinylated -oligonucleotides, or by a comparable technique. Patient 
bone marrow samples will be ass essed on day 0, day 10 ± 1, and day 
28 ± 4 of cycle 1, and on day 28 ± 4 of cycle 2 and compared with 
patient -specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of 
response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele fr equency clearance. Depth of response will be 
defined as the lowest patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a 
bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response will 
be correlated to:  
 Overall response,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutation status,  
 Time to disease progression . 
 
3. Expression profile.  
Expression array profiling will be performed on bone marrow 
samples from day 0 and day 10 ± 1. We will correlate expression 
signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with:  
 Overall response,  
 Mutational status.  
 
4. Steady -state serum decitabine concentration.  
We will assess serum decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 and 
correlation with:  
 Overall response.

Version date: 09/12/12  
  
5. Bone marrow DNA hypomethylation.  
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine 
content using LC -MS. This may serve as a better biomarker of 
adequate dosing than serum drug concentration. Patients will be 
evaluated on day 0 and day 10 ± 1 of cycle 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Overall response , 
 Change in expression signatures.  
 
  
Criteria for evaluation  Efficacy -  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline and at day 10 ± 1 and 
day 28  ± 4 of cy cle 1 and at the end of subsequent even numbered 
cycles . Standard bone marrow procurement procedures will be 
followed for collection of the tissu e. Jeffrey Klco, MD/PhD will act 
as a central reviewer for all bone marrow biopsies.  
 
Peripheral blood counts will be followed by weekly CBC  with differential. 
After cycle 1, the frequency of routine CBC analysis may be 
decreased by the treating physician as clinically indicated.   
 
Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria: [1]  
Morphologic complete remission  (CR) – Defined as morphologic 
leukemia -free state, defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with 
marrow spicules and a count of  ≥ 200 nucleated cells and no blasts with 
Auer rods or any persistence of extramedullary disease, and no evidence 
for dysplasia. When ery throid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone 
marrow nucleated cells, the percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated 
cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid cells, the percentage blasts 
should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence o f mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be 
consistent with treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment 
abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, 
dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR . In addition, ANC 
> 1000/μl and platelet count of ≥ 100,000/μl. Patient must be independent 
of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete 
remission plus a rever sion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion 
to a normal karyotype is defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a 
minimum of 20 mitotic cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) 
may be used as a supplement to follow a specifically defin ed cytogenetic 
abnormality.  
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)  
– Defined as morphologic complete recovery with the exception of 
neutropenia <1000/μl or thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
Partial remission  (PR) – Requires that the above criteria for complete 
remission be met, with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the 
percentage of blasts to 5 -25% in the bone marrow aspirate. A value of 
5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may also be 
considered a pa rtial remission.  
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
 Treatment failure – Includes all patients who did not achieve a complete or 
partial remission.  
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts 
in the bone marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic 
changes are considered a relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripheral 
blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone marrow biopsy should 
be repeated in > 1 week to confir m relapse.  
Safety -- All patients receiving at least one dose of decitabine will be 
evaluated for safety.  
Statistical considerations  This trial will be conducted as a phase II biomarker trial.  
 
This trial is designed to detect the most clinically meaningful mutational 
predictors of response. These are mutations that have sufficient positive 
predictive value to be used as a clinical assay.  
 
A power analysis was performed with Fisher’s exact test for mutation status 
and response to decitabine, assumi ng an expected 45% CR/CRi. With alpha = 
0.05, and a total anticipated enrollment of 100 evaluable patients, we 
anticipate 80% power to detect a 27% and 40% response difference between 
patients with and without a mutation, if the mutation occurs with a resp ective 
frequency of 30% and 15%. Such mutations would provide 80%  sensitivity 
to predict response to decitabine. These are values that would warrant 
diagnostic clinical testing prior to therapy.  
 
This trial is also designed to detect an improvement in cl inical response 
compared to historical controls treated with 5 consecutive days of decitabine 
(20 mg/m2/day every 28 days) [2]. A power analysis was performed with 
Fisher’s exact test for response to decitabine compared to a historical rate of 
24% observed in 55 patients. With 100 evaluable patients enrolled, we 
anticipate 90% power with alpha = 0.1 to detect a 21% improvement in 
response (CR/ PR ≥ 45%). The reported CR/PR rate of the proposed 
treatment schedule (10 consecutive days of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day) is 
64%[3]; the expected CR/PR rate of 45% is a conservative estimation of 
expected outcomes.

 Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
After 2 cycles, if patients achieve morphologic CRi, administration will be decreased to 5 days to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  (20 mg/m2 over 1 hour on Days 1 -5 every 28 ± 4 days) . After two cycles with 
morphologic CRi and no evidence of disease by cytogenetics or immunophenotype , patien ts may further 
decrease therapy to 3 days per cycle  (20 mg/m2 over 1 hour on Days 1 -3 every 28 ± 4 days) . 
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline and at Day 10 ± 1  and Day 28  ± 4 of Cycle 1 and at 
the end of even numbered cycles . 
 
Peripheral blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ± 
15 minutes after decitabine infusion is initiated.20

Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS

10 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence treatment 
algor ithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expressio n. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia ( AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the majority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular e tiology of decitabine sensitivity is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.  
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective hematopoiesis and malignant expansion of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy.  Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy or stem 
cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g.  t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 year s old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment f or MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in  elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hematologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typically 
require 3 -4 weeks of hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively  healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the  outpatient  setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
11 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS and AML 
patients (reviewed in [21]  Decitabine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However, 
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during  at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles befo re maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response to decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabin e 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total genomic DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884.  
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four gen es that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients treated with c ytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is associated with response or res istance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, serum decitabine levels , and DNA

12 methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively assess genomic and 
pharmacologic parameters that could clinically predict p atient response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent ge nomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has be en shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analysis of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typically followed with watchful -waitin g rather than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferase leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately 5 -fold more 
potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might explain why 
decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid progenitors in vitro at lower doses than 
azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing activity at low doses, both agents 
have a direct cytotoxic effect at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improved 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% o f the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have noted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease during a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to response was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in Germany 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

13 A recent study using a prolon ged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using decitabine  to 
treat elderly AML patients or patients with relapsed AML, and this experience is

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoiesis , and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderl y AML patients, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of t herapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly resulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better than many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improve ments in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is d ue to rapid 
inactivation of decitabine by deamination by liver cytidine deaminase. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tum ors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Disappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1  µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectability. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second pha se (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plasma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), R ivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentra tions of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose o r 
plasma drug levels. High clearance values and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentr ations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8 -hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day an d 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous infusion 
over 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell division is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to increase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a  similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64% vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the perce nt methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
16 was the time to blast clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone marrow blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they observed a co rrelation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests that improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by prolonged administration of 
decitabine. Further, that DNA methylcytosine r eduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin inductio n therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusional therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s Day 0 bone marrow sample and 
skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We w ill correlate the presence of mutations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected on day 0, 10 ±1, 28±4 , and 56±4 . We will assess mutations 
in at least 24 recurrently mut ated genes (including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, 
NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, 
MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, 
RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific mutations discovered duri ng exome sequencing. 
The leukemic allele frequency will be measured using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq 
platform using DNA capture by gene specific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient 
bone marrow samples will be assessed on day 0, day 10 ± 1 , and day 28 ±  4 of cycle 1, 
and day 28 ± 4 of cycle 2 and compared with patient specific skin samples (normal 
control). The velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -
specific mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will b e defined as the 
lowest patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a bone marrow sample. The 
velocity and depth of tumor response will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,  
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
17  Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be assessed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the Day 10 ± 1, 28 ± 4, and 56 ± 4 
bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve to validate all exome -discovered 
mutation s. This is important, because exome sequencing is associated with a 20 -50% 
false -discovery rate depending on type I error tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms 
are typically set for greater sensitivity than specificity) .  Thus, many mutations 
discovered d uring exome sequencing are incorrect.  This second analysis of these 
mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  on Day 0 and Day 10 ± 1 with response 
to decitabine . 
We will correlate expres sion signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state serum decitabine concentration on Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Day 10 ± 1 with 
response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated on Day 0 and Day 10 ± 1 of Cycle 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in expression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

22 5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
5.1 Summary of Stud y Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, biomarker study of patients with AML or MDS 
who are treated with 10 consecutive days of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded from 
this trial, because other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment of FAB -M3 acute 
promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < 60 years old and have not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopeni as are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies prior to therapy, on Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1 and 2 for comprehensive genomic correlative studies. Patients will 
also provide peripheral blood samples on Day 4 ± 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cyc les.  The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
After 2 cycles, if  patients achieve CRi, the administration of decitabine will be decreased 
to 5 days. After two cycles with CRi and no evidence of disease by  cytogenetics or 
immunophenotype, patients will further decrease therapy 3 consecutive days.   The dose of 
decitabine will remain 20 mg/m2/day over 1 hour regardless of decreases in the number of 
days per cycle of administration.  
 
Patients who achieve stable disease, partial response , or complete response will continue 
on decitabine therapy  (receiving cycles of 3 -10 days every 28 days  (i.e., Days 1 -10, Days 
1-5, or Days 1 -3), depending on response)  until time of progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
or pa tient decision to discontinue study drugs.  
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating physician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical go al is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by the treating physician. 
However, the devel opment of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.

27 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML  and MDS , their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infection. A patient 
will meet criterion for discontinuation of the study if the patient is observed to have a delay 
of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or h epatic dysfunction occurs during  a treatment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below the limits 
listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities, decitabine treatment should be delayed until 
recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. For toxicities felt to be related to decitabine, decitabine 
may be reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at the discretion of  the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose or Schedule  
 
Once patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  (morphologic leukemia -free state, defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate 
with marrow spicules and a co unt of  ≥ 200 nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods, 
any persistence of extramedullary disease, or persistent pre -treatment morphologic 
abnormalities, such as pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, or dysplastic 
megakaryocytes) , administrati on may be decreased to 5 consecutive days to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity, per treating physician. After two cycles with bone marrow blast 
counts < 5% and no evidence of disease by cytogenetics or immunophenotype, patients 
may further decrease therapy t o 3 consecutive days per cycle, per treating physician .

28 7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine is an antimetabolite that can replace cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine activity has not been determined 
and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by correcting 
DNA methylation, a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor g ene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar t o other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparation  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconsti tuted solution should be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless used 
within 15 minutes of reconstit ution, the diluted solution must be prepared using 
cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 degrees 
F) for a maximum of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be admin istered either as an inpatient or an outpatient.  
 
7.1.2 Supplier  
 
Decitabine is available commercially.

30 8.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES SAMPLE COLLECTIONS  
 
Bone marrow samples  will be collected at Baseline, on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and on Day 28  ± 4 of 
Cycle 1 and of even number cycles for correlative studies. Bone marrow aspirate (6 -10 ml) will be 
collected and divided between two EDTA (lavender top) tubes. The bone marrow samples and 
peripheral blood  samples should be delivered by hand to Sandra McDonald , M.D. PhD, director 
of the Tissue Procurement Core Facility at the Siteman Cancer Center.  At the Tissue Procurement 
Core Facility, patient identification will be removed from the samples, and the cel ls will be stored 
as frozen pellets in DMSO at 107 per tube. Subsequently, the samples will be thawed, and cells 
will be assayed.  
 
Peripheral blood sample  (3 mL) will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 4 ± 1.  Sample must be obtained 
45 minutes ± 15 minutes after  beginning the infusion, before the decitabine infusion is complete, 
and should be obtained from the opposite arm as the infusion.  The sample should be collected in 
a 3 mL K3EDTA tube pre -loaded with 8 mcL of tetrahydrouridine (THU 500 mcg/mL), an 
inhibit or of cytidine deaminase.  The sample should be processed by the Tissue Procurement Core 
Facility at the Siteman Cancer Center.  Serum should be separated and stored per protocols.

31 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  
 
Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage  of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be in dependent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as  no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,00 0/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Requires that the above criteria for complete remission be met, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer  rods present may 
also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Treatment failure – Includes all patients who did not achieve a complete or partial 
remission  following 4 cycles of therapy .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Relapse following complete remission  is defined as 
reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone marrow, not 
attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes are considered a relapse. If there 
are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the  bone marrow, bone marrow 
biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.  
  
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
32 9.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease  
 
Bone marrow biopsy should be performed at baseline for both the correlative  study and 
clinical  evaluation. Bone marrow biopsy should be performed on Day 28  ± 4 of cycle 1  
and on Day 28 ± 4 of each even cycle for clinical disease assessment.  
 
Peripheral blood counts will be followed by weekly CBC with differential and platelets.   
After the first cycle, this may be changed to every other week  or monthly  at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  
 
9.3 Progressive Disease  
 
Progressive disease is defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
greater than 50% incre ase compared with baseline. Patients with progressive disease  will 
be removed from the study.  
 
Patients may also be removed from the study for progressive disease base d on evidence of 
new extramedullary disease or based on the clinical  judgment  of the treating physician . 
 
Patient s with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the total 
peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy regardless of the cycle number.  
 
9.4 Other Secondary Ef ficacy Measures  
 
9.4.1 Overall Survival and Event-free Survival  
 
Overall survival  is defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death 
from any cause.  Patients still alive at the time of the final analysis will be right -
censored.  
 
Event -free survival  is defined as the interval from the date of first dose of study 
drug to date of treatment failure, recurrence, death due to any cause, or loss to 
follow up.  
 
9.4.2 Duration of Remission and Relapse -free Survival for Patients Having 
Complete Remission  
 
Duration of complete remission  is defined as the interval from  the date that 
complete remission is documented to the date of recurrence , death due to any cause , 
or loss to follow -up.  
 
Relapse -free survival  is defined only for those patients achieving a complete 
remission. It is defined as the interval from the date of first documentation of a

Version date: 09/12/12  
33 leukemia -free state to the date of recurrence, death due to any cause , or loss to 
follow up.   
  
9.4.3 Safety  
 
Safety eval uation will include assessments of adverse experiences, medical history, 
physical examinations, vital signs, and laboratory assessments at baseline and 
throughout the study period. Local laboratories may be used for this study.

10.2 Unanticipated Problems  
 
Definition:  
 
 unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, 
experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the 
research); and  
 suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
 
10.3 Noncompliance  
 
Definition:  failure to follow any applicable regulation or institutional policies that govern 
human subj ects research or failure to follow the determinations of the 
IRB.   Noncompliance may occur due to lack of knowledge or due to deliberate choice to 
ignore regulations, institutional policies, or determinations of the IRB.

35 10.5 Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned deviation from the approved protocol t hat are under the research 
team’s control. Exceptions apply only to a single participant or a singular situation.  
 
Pre-approval of all protocol exceptions must be obtained prior to the event.  
 
10.6 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) and the Quality 
Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) at Washington 
University:  
 
The PI is required to promptly notify the IRB of the following events:  
 
 Any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others which occur 
at WU, any BJH  or SLCH institution, or that impacts participants or the conduct of 
the study.  
 Noncompliance with federal regulations or the requirements or determinations of 
the IRB.  
 Receipt of new information that may impact the willingness of participants to 
participa te or continue participation in the research study.  
 
These events must be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the occurrence of the 
event or notification to the PI of the event.   The death of a research participant that qualifies 
as a reportable event should be reported within 1 working day  of the occurrence of the 
event or notification to the PI of the event.  
 
10.7 Reporting to the FDA  
 
The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.  
PLEASE NOTE THAT REPORTING REQUIRE MENTS FOR THE FDA DIFFER 
FROM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HRPO/QASMC.  It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to report any unanticipated problem to the FDA as 
follows:  
 
 Report any unexpected fatal or life -threatening adverse experiences associated with 
use of the drug (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have 
been caused by the drug) by telephone or fax no later than 7 calendar days  after 
initial receipt of the information.  A life-threatening adverse experience  is defined 
as any adverse drug experience that places the subject (in the view of the 
investigator) at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does 
not include  a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
 Report any serious, unexpected adverse experiences, as well as results from animal 
studies that suggest significant clinical risk within 15 calendar days  after initial 
receip t of this information.  A serious adverse drug experience  is defined as any 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
36 adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization  
o A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other experience which, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
An unexpected adverse drug experience  is defined as any adverse drug experience, 
the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current investigator 
brochure (or risk information, if an IB is not required or available).

receive at least one dose of decitabine .  
 
Efficacy -Evaluable  - The efficacy -evaluable (EE) population will be defined as all patients 
who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of 
decitabine . 
 
12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
12.2.1  Descriptive Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation , median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demographic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
12.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response r ates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlated with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutati ons and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by contingency 
tables and assessed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the  significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also be fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple test ing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known to be too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 09/12/12  
39 responsive status) will be used to derive an empirical critical P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutati on tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by the total number of permutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is to determine whether any 
of these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
association that would 
warrant pre -treatment testing. 
We believe that a reasonable 
cut off would be if at least 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a sp ecific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT3A expression). 
In addition, we expect that 
the majority of the enrolled 
125 patients c an be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will 
be acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or 
less).  
 
12.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 28, and 56 days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina based platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients wh o achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples sequenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

40 interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipated standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clone. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -responders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each grou p. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state serum decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will be measured and 
correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease i n bone marrow  methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi and those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
serum levels of decitabine with response wi ll be assessed using 2 -sample t -test or 
Mann -Whitney non -parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The change of total 
bone marrow DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association with both 
steady -state serum drug levels and response will be assessed us ing 2 -way ANOVA 
for repeated measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for 
between -group differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time 
differences. Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expressio n 
profiles and SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at two separate time points for clo nes with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard 
deviation o f 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between 45 evaluable respo nders and 55 evaluable non -
responders with an expected standard deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

Phase of development  Phase II 
Study objectives  Primary:   
- To determine whether patient -specific mutations correlate with clinical 
overall response to decitabine in patients with AML or MDS.  
Secondary:   
- To determine whether 10 consecutive days per cycle of decitabine 
improves outcomes compared with historical controls  treated with 5 
consecutive days per cycle of decitabine . 
- To determine whether other biomarkers correlate with clinical overall 
response to decitabine in patients with AML or MDS. The se will include: 
velocity and depth of patient -specific mutation clearance, bone marrow 
expression profile and change in expression profile during decitabine 
treatment, steady -state serum decitabine concentrations, and decrease in 
bone marrow methylcytosin e content in response to decitabine.

Expected number of 
patients  Total: 125.  
Evaluable for all molecular studies: 100.  
Enrollment time table: 25 patients will be enrolled initially at Washington 
University. Once the molecular pipeline for routine exome analysis is 
established, at least 2 additional sites will be added.  
Study drug formulation 
and administration  Decitabin e (5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is a lyophilized white powder available 
for injection in 20 -mL single -use vials containing 50 mg of drug. The 
product should be stored at room temperature. Prior to use, the test product is 
reconstituted in 10 mL of sterile water  for injection. The reconstituted 
concentrate is further diluted with cold infusion solution to obtain a final 
concentration of decitabine of between 0.1 to 1.0 mg/mL.  
 
All patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2 given as a 1 hour continuous 
IV infusion on consecutive days 1 -10 of each cycle ; the dose should be 
calculated based on actual body weight at the beginning of each cycle .  
 
Once patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete 
blood count recovery (CRi)  (morphologic leukemia -free s tate, defined as less 
than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of  ≥ 200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods, no persistence of 
extramedullary disease, and no persistent pre -treatment morphologic 
abnormalities, such as pseudo -Pelger-Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, or 
dysplastic megakaryocytes) administration may be decreased to 5 
consecutive days to limit myelosuppressive toxicity, per treating physician. 
After two cycles with bone marrow blast counts < 5% and no evidence of 
disease by cytogenetics or immunophenotype, patients may further decrease 
therapy to 3 consecutive days per cycle, per treating physician.  
Each cycle will be 28 ± 4 days.  
Duration of treatment  Treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
 Death,  
 Disease progression  (as defined in 3.7.1.3),  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or

Version date: 08/01/12  
  General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating 
physician.  
Correlative studies  Bone marrow samples for correlative studies will be collected prestudy, on 
Cycle 1 day 10 ± 1 and day 28 ± 4, and on day 28 ± 4 of subsequent even 
numbered cycles.  
Peripheral blood samples for correlative studies will be collected prestudy, 
and on Cycle 1 day 4 ± 1.   
 
1. Identify Patient -specific mutation s 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s day 0 bone 
marrow sample and skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -
associated variants, defined as variants found in the bone marrow 
sample and not in the skin sample. We will correlate the presence of 
mutations with overall response.  
2. Velocity and depth of response.  
We will assess the rate of tumor clearance by measuring the allele 
frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone marrow samples 
during cycles 1 and 2. We will assess mutations in at least 24 
recurrently mutated genes (including, but not limited to: FLT3,  
DNMT3A, NPM1, TET2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, 
U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, 
ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, RAD21 ) as well as all 
patient -specific mutations discovered during exome sequencing. The 
leukemic allele frequen cy will be measured using the Illumnia 
MySeq or HiSeq platform using DNA capture by gene specific 
biotinylated -oligonucleotides, or by a comparable technique. Patient 
bone marrow samples will be assessed on day 0, day 10 ± 1, and day 
28 ± 4 of cycle 1, and  on day 28 ± 4 of cycle 2 and compared with 
patient -specific skin samples (normal control). The velocity of 
response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -specific 
mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will be 
defined as th e lowest patient -specific mutation allele frequency in a 
bone marrow sample. The velocity and depth of tumor response will 
be correlated to:  
 Overall response,  
 Time to best response,  
 Mutation status,  
 Time to disease progression . 
 
3. Expression profile.  
Expr ession array profiling will be performed on bone marrow 
samples from day 0 and day 10 ± 1. We will correlate expression 
signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with:  
 Overall response,  
 Mutational status.  
 
4. Steady -state serum decitabine concentra tion. 
We will assess serum decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 and 
correlation with:  
 Overall response.

Version date: 08/01/12  
 5. Bone marrow DNA hypomethylation.  
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine 
content using LC -MS. This may serve as a better  biomarker of 
adequate dosing than serum drug concentration. Patients will be 
evaluated on day 0 and day 10 ± 1 of cycle 1. The change in DNA 
methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Overall response , 
 Change in expression signatures.  
 
  
Criteria for evaluation  Efficacy -  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline and at day 10 ± 1 and 
day 28  ± 4 of cy cle 1 and at the end of subsequent even numbered 
cycles . Standard bone marrow procurement procedures will be 
followed for collection of the tis sue. Jeffrey Klco, MD/PhD will act 
as a central reviewer for all bone marrow biopsies.  
 
Peripheral blood counts will be followed by weekly CBC  with differential. 
After cycle 1, the frequency of routine CBC analysis may be 
decreased by the treating physicia n as clinically indicated.   
 
Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria: [1]  
Morphologic complete remission  (CR) – Defined as morphologic 
leukemia -free state, defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with 
marrow spicules and a count of  ≥ 200 nucleated cells and no blasts with 
Auer rods or any persistence of extramedullary disease, and no evidence 
for dysplasia. Wh en erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone 
marrow nucleated cells, the percentage of blasts is based on all nucleated 
cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid cells, the percentage blasts 
should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The pres ence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be 
consistent with treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment 
abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, 
dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consi stent with CR . In addition, ANC 
> 1000/μl and platelet count of ≥ 100,000/μl. Patient must be independent 
of transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete 
remission plus a  reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion 
to a normal karyotype is defined as no clonal abnormalities detected in a 
minimum of 20 mitotic cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) 
may be used as a supplement to follow a specifically  defined cytogenetic 
abnormality.  
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)  
– Defined as morphologic complete recovery with the exception of 
neutropenia <1000/μl or thrombocytopenia <100,000/μl.  
Partial remission  (PR) – Requires that the above criteria for complete 
remission be met, with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the 
percentage of blasts to 5 -25% in the bone marrow aspirate. A value of 
5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer rods present may also be 
considere d a partial remission.  
Treatment failure – Includes all patients who did not achieve a complete or 
partial remission.

Version date: 08/01/12  
 Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Relapse following complete remission is 
defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts 
in the bone marrow, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic 
changes are considered a relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripheral 
blood and 5 -20% blasts in the bone marrow, bone marrow biopsy should 
be repeated in > 1 week to  confirm relapse.  
Safety -- All patients receiving at least one dose of decitabine will be 
evaluated for safety.  
Statistical considerations  This trial will be conducted as a phase II biomarker trial.  
 
This trial is designed to detect the most clinically meaningful mutational 
predictors of response. These are mutations that have sufficient positive 
predictive value to be used as a clinical assay.  
 
A power analysis was performed with Fisher’s exact test for mutation status 
and response to decitabine, assumi ng an expected 45% CR/CRi. With alpha = 
0.05, and a total anticipated enrollment of 100 evaluable patients, we 
anticipate 80% power to detect a 27% and 40% response difference between 
patients with and without a mutation, if the mutation occurs with a resp ective 
frequency of 30% and 15%. Such mutations would provide 80%  sensitivity 
to predict response to decitabine. These are values that would warrant 
diagnostic clinical testing prior to therapy.  
 
This trial is also designed to detect an improvement in cl inical response 
compared to historical controls treated with 5 consecutive days of decitabine 
(20 mg/m2/day every 28 days) [2]. A power analysis was performed with 
Fisher’s exact test for response to decitabine compared to a historical rate of 
24% observed in 55 patients. With 100 evaluable patients enrolled, we 
anticipate 90% power with alpha = 0.1 to detect a 21% improvement in 
response (CR/ PR ≥ 45%). The reported CR/PR rate of the proposed 
treatment schedule (10 consecutive days of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day) is 
64%[3]; the expected CR/PR rate of 45% is a conservative estimation of 
expected outcomes.

 Study Schema:  
 
 
Patients with p rogressive disease after two cycles ( defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
> 50% increase in bone marrow blasts over baseline ) should be removed from study . 
Patients with stable disease may conti nue on study and should undergo a diagnostic bone marrow biopsy at the end 
of even numbered cycles.  
After 2 cycles, if patients achieve morphologic CRi, administration will be decreased to 5 days to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity  (20 mg/m2 over 1 hour on Days 1 -5 every 28 ± 4 days) . After two cycles with 
morphologic CRi and no evidence of disease by cytogenetics or immunophenotype , patien ts may further 
decrease therapy to 3 days per cycle  (20 mg/m2 over 1 hour on Days 1 -3 every 28 ± 4 days) . 
Sample collection for correlative studies:  
Bone marrow biopsies should be performed at baseline and at Day 10 ± 1  and Day 28  ± 4 of Cycle 1 and at 
the end of even numbered cycles . 
 
Peripheral blood sample s should be co llected on Day 4± 1 of Cycle 1.  Collection should be obtained 45 ± 
15 minutes after decitabine infusion is initiated.20

10 1.0 INTRODUCTIO N 
 
1.1 Rational e   
 
Personalized therapy for cancer requires that 1) patient -specific factors (e.g. patient -
specific mutations, expression profiles, or pharmacogenomics) influence  treatment 
algorithms, and 2) once therapy is initiated, in vivo  responsiveness is used to guide further 
therapy. The modern era of genomics has provided significant insights into cancer 
pathogenesis by describing patterns of germline and somatic variants,  as well as defining 
disease -specific patterns of gene expression. However, the application and integration of 
this data with therapeutics remains a difficult task.  
 
Decitabine is a commonly used single -agent therapy for patients with acute myeloid 
leukemi a (AML ) and/or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ). Historically, it has yielded 
clinical complete responses in approximately 25% of patients across diverse clinical trials, 
it is well tolerated, and it can be given as in the outpatient  setting . However, the ma jority 
of patients do not respond to decitabine, the molecular etiology of decitabine sensitivity is 
unknown, and there are no algorithms to predict patient responsiveness a priori or even 
within one month of starting therapy.  
 
AML and MDS are two closely related hematological disorder s characterized by 
ineffective hematopoiesis and malignant expansion of clonal myeloid cells.  Both AML 
and MDS frequently occur  in elderly patients and some cases are secondary and/or related 
to long -term bone marrow damage after radiation or chemotherapy. Current therapy for 
AML consists of cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy or stem 
cell transplantation. Using these approaches, current cure rates may be as high as 60% for 
patients younger than 60 with good risk cytogenetics (e.g. t(15;17 ), t(8;21), inv(16)) .[4]  
Outcomes in patients ≥ 60 years old and with relapsed disease remain poor with 2 year 
survival of only ~25%. [5] Historically, t he available treatment for MDS has been 
symptomatic and has not been shown to be effective in producing sustained improvement 
in hematopoiesis or in delaying leukemic evolution [6, 7] .  
 
Current  AML therapy is poorly tolerated in elderly and pre -treated patients due to  
hemat ologic and non -hematologic toxicities; following such therapy, patients typically 
require 3 -4 weeks of hospitalization for treatment of neutropenic fevers and for regular 
transfusions . Even among the relatively healthy patients enrolled in clinical trials, induction 
mortality in the elderly can be as high as 20 -40% following standard induction therapy ,[8-
11] and moderate to severe non -hematologic toxicity occurs in at least an additional 30% 
of patients. [9, 12 -14] Consequently, many older AML patients are not offered traditional 
intensive chemotherapy, but receive supportive care alone. [15]  More effective and less 
toxic therapies  are needed to provide durable remissions in a significant proportion of 
elder ly AML in population s. 
 
Decitabine has been studied in  MDS patients and in  elderly  and/or relapsed  AML patients . 
It has been found to be reasonably well tolerated, can be given in the outpatient  setting , 
and has overall response rates of 20 -45%.[2, 3, 16 -20] Our own experience has been of 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 08/08/12  
11 CR/PR rates of 25% , [2] and this is typical of many other groups for both MDS and AML 
patients (reviewed in [21]  Decit abine is an S -phase depended drug.  [22 -24] However, 
decitabine is usually administered  in one hour daily infusions  during 3  to 5 consecutive 
days (too short to expose decitabine to most AM L blasts  during at least 2 cycles of 
replication , which divide every 2  to 7 days). [25-27]  Recent experience with increasing  the 
number of infusion s per cycle from 5 consecutive days to 10 consecutive days has 
improved overall response rates to 67%. [3] Response to decitabine can be slow, sometimes 
requiring 3  to 5 cycles before maximum response is observed. [2] As a consequence, many 
patients are exposed to prolonged therapy, gaining little benefit, before determining 
resistance. There are currently no biomarkers that predict response t o decitabine.  
 
Decitabine is a cytosine analogue that cannot be methylated. Incorporation of decitabine 
into DNA prevents DNA methylation at cytosine residues and derepresses epigenetically 
silenced gene expression. Therefore, the reduction in total genomi c DNA methylcytosine 
content acts as a marker of effective decitabine dosing. Indeed, two groups have recently 
correlated effective methylcytosine reduction and gene expression derepression to 
response  (Figure 1.1) .[3, 28] 
 
  
   
Figure 1.1. From Shen et al JCO (2010) 28:611 and Blum et al JCO (2007) 25: 3884 . 
 
We and others have recently  used whole genome sequencing to identify  recurrent, somatic 
mutations in AML and MDS patients in four genes that are involved in methylcytosine 
regulation: DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2. [29-37] Collectively, nearly half of all 
AML/MDS patients have a mutation in one of these four genes.  DNMT3A mutations are 
associated with an adverse outcome in AML patients trea ted with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. [35, 38] However, it is not yet clear whether the presence of mutations in 
one or more of these genes is ass ociated with response or resistance to decitabine.  
 
In this study, we will treat patients with the current state -of-the-art decitabine schedule. [3] 
We will perform exome sequencing on all patients and correlate response with mutation 
status, rate of mutat ion clearance , expression profile, serum decitabine levels , and DNA

12 methylcytosine content reduction. This approach will comprehensively assess genomic and 
pharmacologic parameters that could clinically predict p atient response to decitabine.  
 
In this study , we will combine analysis of patients with AML and MDS. Recent genomic 
analysis has shown that AML and MDS have share d mutations in many of the same genes , 
shared patterns of mutation acquisition, and shared patterns of mutation evolution .[39, 40] 
Furthermore, MDS, like AML, presents  with clonal hematopoiesis, even when the 
morphologic blast count is zero. [36]Because this study will identify and track the rate of 
clearance of patient specific mutations, and because decitabine has been shown to have 
efficacy in both AML and MDS patients,  [2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] combining analysis of AML 
and MDS patients is reasonable.   Asymptomatic MDS patients are excluded because these 
patients are typically followed with watchful -waiting rather  than with chemotherapy.  
  
1.2 Decitabine  and Hypomethylating agents in AML /MDS  
 
Methylation of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide by DNA methyltransferase leads to 
transcriptional silencing of genes during normal development and has emerged as a 
significant mechanism for the loss of tumor suppressor gene expression in human cancer, 
including AML  and MDS .[46, 47] Like azacitidine , decitabine  (5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine) is 
incorporated into DNA  during S phase and forms covalent adducts with DNA 
methyltransferase. The irreversible inhibition of this enzyme results in loss of methylation 
and is associated with differentiation. [48]  Decitabine is an approximately 5 -fold more 
potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase than azacitidine , which might explain why 
decitabine  can induce differentiation of myeloid pro genitors in vitro at lower doses than 
azacitidine . In addition to their differentiation inducing activity at low doses, both agents 
have a direct cytotoxic effect at higher doses  (1-2 µM) .[49]  
 
Decitabine has been investigated in hematologic malignancies using a range of doses and 
schedules.  It is currently FDA approved for the treatment of adults with MDS at a dose of 
15 mg/m2 every 8 hours for 3 days, based on a Phase III study that demonstrated improved 
outcomes in the treatment arm compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. [15]  
However, the overall response rate  in this trial w as modest ( 17%). Of note, 18% of the 
patients in th is trial had 20 -30% bone marrow blasts, meeting the current WHO criteria for 
AML.  Subsequent p hase I and II studies in AML, using a variety of low -dose decitabine 
regimens, have reporte d overall response rates of 22 -49%.[2, 3, 16 -19, 41 -45] Comparisons 
of multiple low dose schedules have no ted improved efficacy in the MDS population using 
a dose of 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle. [50, 51 ] Because of these results, we 
have recently explored this dosing schedule in the treatment of elderly patients with 
AML. [52] In this study, we observe d an overall response rate of 24 %, and an additional  
44% of patients achiev ed stable disease dur ing a median of 5 monthly cycles. [48] In this 
study, we noted that decitabine  does not act quickly and the median time to resp onse was 
3 months. These results are similar to the recently published experience in Germany 
treating 227 patients with 15 mg/m2 over 3 hours TID for 3 days every 6 weeks, which 
resulted in a CR/PR rate of 26%. [16]

13 A recent study using a prolonged administration schedule (20 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on 
consecutive days 1 -10) showed improved  response (64 % CR/PR) and improved time to 
respond (50% of patients had bone marrow blasts < 5% after 1 cycle of therapy). [3]  These 
results are an improvement over previous experience by other groups using decitabine  to 
treat elderly AML patients or patients with relapsed AML, and this experience is 
summarized below:

In general, decitabine  is well tolerated. Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, 
decitabine  can be administered in the outpatient setting. However, AML  and MDS are  
aggressive hematologic malignanc ies. Cy topenias commonly result from AML /MDS  
inhibition of normal hematopoies is, and often do not resolve until a complete response is 
achieved. Thus, neutropenic sepsis and thrombocytopenic bleeding remain significant  
problems regardless  of therapy, especially during the first 4 -8 weeks. In our experience 
treating elderly AML pati ents, neutropenia occurred in 24%, sepsis in 9% , and bacteremia 
in 7%.  Similar results have been observed in MDS patients. [20, 53, 54 ] As a result, death 
is not uncommon in the first 8 weeks of therapy, occurring in 15 -17% of patients, and most 
commonly res ulting from infection  and cytope nias related to disease and the rapy.[16, 52, 
55] While unsettling, these numbers are better t han many historical patients  treated with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy , and suggest a need for continued improvements in therapy .[9, 12]

1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Metabol ism of Decitabine  
 
In human subjects , after IV administration, decitabine displayed a distribution phase 
with a half -life of 7 minutes and a terminal phase elimination half -life of 10-35 
minutes as measured by bioassay. [56, 57]   The short plasma half -life is due to rapid 
inacti vation of decitabine by deamination by liver cytidine deaminase. [23] Total 
body clearance (Cl p) in humans was high with a mean value of 126 mL/min/kg. [58]  
 
Among five adult patients with advanced solid tumors administered seven courses 
of 100 mg/m2 of decitabine by 1 -hour infusions, [56] maximum plasma 
concentration ranged from 1 to 4 µM. Disappearance from plasma was biphasic 
with a rapid initial decline to less than 0.1 µM during the first hour post infusion 
and a slower decline over the next two hours to 6 nM, the level of detectabilit y. 
Plasma half -life (mean SE) was estimated to be approximately 7 1 minutes in the 
initial phase (t ½α) and 355 minutes in the second phase (t ½β). The area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve was 408 88 ng.hour/mL for these patients, with a 
peak plas ma concentration of 2.01 0.44 µM (0.440.1 µg/mL), while mean volume 
of distribution (Vd ss) and CLp was 4.59 1.42 L/kg and 126 21 mL/min/kg, 
respectively. The time course of DAC concentrations was similar in 1 of 2 patients 
administered 75 mg/m2, while DAC  was usually undetectable in the plasma of 
patients administered 25 to 60 mg/m2. 
 
Using a longer infusion time (up to 40 hours), Rivard et al. [57] reported a plasma 
concentration of 0.1 to 0.4 g/mL. With infusion times of 40 -60 hours, at an infusion 
rate of 1 mg/kg/h, plasma concentrations of 0.43 -0.76 µg/mL were achieved. [59]  The 
steady -state plasma concentration at an infusion rate of 1  mg/kg/h was estimated to 
be 0.2 -0.5 µg/mL. The half -life after discontinuing the infusion was 12 -20 min.[57]  
 
Urinary excretion of unchanged decitabine was low, ranging from less than 0.01% to 
0.9% of the total dose, and there was no relationship between excretion and dose or 
plasma drug levels. High clearance va lues and a total urinary excretion of <1% of the 
administered dose suggest that decitabine is eliminated rapidly and largely by 
metabolic processes, including extrahepatic metabolism. [60] 
 
The steady state plasma concentrations (C ss) ranged from 0.31 to 0.39 µg/mL (1.27 
to 1.60 µM) during the infusion  of 100 mg/m² decitabine over a 6 -hour period. [61] 
The range of concentrations during a 600 mg/m2 infusion over an 8-hour period  was 
0.41-16 g/mL (1.68 to 4.76 µM). [60] These plasma concentrations are in the same 
range as the in vitro concentrations that activated the expression of tumor 
suppressor gene p16 in three human non -small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell 
lines. [61]  
 
Steady state decitabine levels of 0.1 to 0.2 µM were achieved in solid tumor patients 
dosed with 30 mg/m²/day and 40 mg/m²/day by continuous intravenous in fusion 
over 72 hours. [62]

In our experience  treating primary patient blasts in vitro , concentrations of 100 – 
500 nM are required maximize methylcytosine reduction without causing cellular 
toxicity. Because decitabine incorporation into DNA is S -phase dependent, 
exposure of cells during cell divisi on is necessary for efficacy.  
  
 
 
 
1.2.2 Experience with  extended dosing schedules  
 
Blum et al recently published their experience treating  elderly AML patients with 
a 10-day course of decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion .[3] This prolonged 
exposure course was designed to incre ase the number of AML blast divisions 
exposed to decitabine per cycle. Toxicities were very similar to a similar regiment 
given as a 3 and 5 day course ,[2, 16]  but the overal l response (CR/PR) was much 
improved (64 % vs 25%). In all three  studies, the toxicities were primarily myeloid 
suppression and the resultant infectious and bleeding complications associated  with 
leukemic and pharmacologic hematopoietic suppression. Furthermore, Blum et al 
noted that the percent methylcytosine reduction was improved (22% vs 11%) as 
 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 08/08/12  
16 was the time to blast clearance (50% of patients who ultimately achieved a CR had 
≤ 5% bone mar row blasts after 1 cycle vs 0% of patients after 2 cycles). Finally, 
like Shen et al, they observed a correlation between the extent of methylcytosine 
reduction and response. [28]  This study suggests t hat improvement in response 
rates and time to response can be achieved by prolonged administration of 
decitabine. Further, that DNA methylcytosine reduction can be achieved with 
prolonged exposure to decitabine and that this might be a patient -specific biological 
marker of adequate  dosing.  
  
Scandura et al. recently published a study of infusional decitabine prior to 
cytarabine + daunorubicin induction therapy for AML. [64] They escalated the 
duration of infusio nal therapy and reached their planned goal of 20 mg/m2/day x 7 
days of continuous therapy given prior to cytarabine and daunorubicin. They noted 
similar toxicities (primarily hematopoietic and the associated neutropenic 
infections) , but that these were not  different from their experience giving cytarabine 
+ daunorubicin alone.  
 
1.3 Correlative Studies  
 
The goals of the correlative studies include:  
 
1. To correlate p atient -specific mutations  with response to decitabine . 
We will perform exome sequencing of each patient’s Day 0 bone marrow sample and 
skin sample. We will determine AML/MDS -associated variants found in the bone 
marrow, but not skin sample. We will correlate the presence of mutations with response 
(especially mutations in DNMT3A,  IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ). This study is powered to 
identify mutations with >80% sensitivity to predict decitabine response if used as a 
clinical assay.  
 
2. To correlate the v elocity and depth of response  with response to decitabine . 
We will assess tumor burden by allele frequency of patient -specific mutations in bone 
marrow samp les collected on day 0, 10 ±1, 28±4 , and 56±4 . We will assess mutations 
in at least 24 recurrently mutated genes (including, but not limited to: FLT3, DNMT3A, 
NPM1, TET 2, WT1, IDH1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, U2AF1, KRAS, PHF6, 
MSTP9, PTPN11, KIT, SMC3, PRUNE2, ETV6, CEBPA, SMC1A, ASXL1, STAG2, 
RAD21 ) as well as all patient -specific mutations discovered during exome sequencing. 
The leukemic allele frequency will be measure d using the Illumnia MySeq or HiSeq 
platform using DNA capture by gene specific biotinylated -oligonucleotides. Patient 
bone marrow samples will be assessed on day 0, day 10 ± 1 , and day 28 ± 4 of cycle 1, 
and day 28 ± 4 of cycle 2 and compared with patient  specific skin samples (normal 
control). The velocity of response will be calculated as the natural log rate of patient -
specific mutation allele frequency clearance. Depth of response will be defined as the 
lowest patient -specific mutation allele frequency  in a bone marrow sample. The 
velocity and depth of tumor response will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Time to best response,

Version date: 08/08/12  
17  Mutational status,  
 Time to disease progression.  
Because all patient -specific exome -discovered mutations will be ass essed a second 
time in the primary bone marrow sample as well as the Day 10 ± 1, 28 ± 4, and 56 ± 4 
bone marrow samples, t his study will also serve to validate all exome -discovered 
mutations. This is important, because exome sequencing is associated with a  20-50% 
false -discovery rate depending on type I error tolerated  (mutation -calling algorithms 
are typically set for greater sensitivity than specificity) .  Thus, many mutations 
discovered during exome sequencing are incorrect.  This second analysis of thes e 
mutations will server to exclude these false positive calls.  
 
3. To correlate the bone marrow e xpression profile  on Day 0 and Day 10 ± 1 with response 
to decitabine . 
We will correlate expression signatures, and changes in expression signatures, with : 
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Mutation status . 
 
4. To correlate steady -state serum decitabine concentration on Day 4 ± 1 with:  
 Achievement of CR.  
 
5. To correlate the extent of b one marrow DNA hypomethylation  on Day 10 ± 1 with 
response to decitabine . 
We will assess the percent reduction in bone marrow methylcytosine content using LC -
MS. Patients will be evaluated on Day 0 and Day 10 ± 1 of Cycle 1. The change in 
DNA methylcytosine content will be correlated to:  
 Achievement of clinical CR,  
 Change in exp ression signature . 
This will determine whether inadequate blast exposure to decitabine correlates with 
drug resistance.

22 5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
5.1 Summary of Study Design  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm, Phase II, biomarker study of patients with AML or MDS 
who are treated with 10 consecutive days of decitabine.  FAB -M3 AML is excluded from 
this trial, because other well -tolerate d options exist for the treatment of FAB -M3 acute 
promyelocytic leukemia. AML patients who are < 60 years old and have not received 
cytotoxic induction chemotherapy are also excluded , because cytotoxic therapy offers a 
curative possibility for these patients.  MDS patients without cytopenias are also excluded 
because these patients can be followed with watchful -waiting . 
 
All patients will undergo bone marrow biopsies prior to therapy, on Day 10 ± 1, and on 
Day 28 ± 4 of Cycles 1 and 2 for comprehensive genomic correlative studies. Patients will 
also provide peripheral blood samples on Day 4 ± 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.  
 
Patients will receive decitabine 20 mg/m2/day as a 1 -hour infusion on consecutive Days 1 -
10 in 28 -day cycles.   The dose will be calculated based on actual patient weight at the 
beginning of each cycle.  
 
After 2 cycles, if  patients achieve CRi, the admini stration of decitabine will be decreased 
to 5 days. After two cycles with CRi and no evidence of disease by cytogenetics or 
immunophenotype, patients will further decrease therapy 3 consecutive days.   The dose of 
decitabine will remain 20 mg/m2/day over 1 hour regardless of decreases in the number of 
days per cycle of administration.  
 
Patients who achieve stable disease, partial response , or complete response will continue 
on decitabine therapy  (receiving cycles of 3 -10 days every 28 days  (i.e., Days 1 -10, Days 
1-5, or Days 1 -3), depending on response)  until time of progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
or patient decision to discontinue study drugs.  
 
It will be a logistical goal of this trial consistently to return preliminary exome results to 
the treating ph ysician by the end of Cycle 1 and validated results by the end of Cycle 2. 
However, this logistical goal is not a primary or secondary aim of this study. Given the 
limited data regarding mutation presence and drug response, we do not anticipate that the 
results will directly influence therapeutic decisions made by the treating physician. 
However, the development of comprehensive genomic pipelines and integration of this 
data into a clinical trial setting will be required before personalized medicine can be 
realized.

27 6.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Delay for Cytopenia or Infection  
 
As cytopenias are a defining feature of AML  and MDS , their presence alone does not 
generally warrant dose modifications or delays. Patients will receive four cycles of therapy 
without adjustment for any cytopenia.  
 
Patients with febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5° with ANC < 1,000/ l) or systemic 
infections should have treatment held until clinical resolution of the infec tion. A patient 
will meet criterion for discontinuation of the study if the patient is observed to have a delay 
of > 8 weeks between any two cycles.  
 
6.2 Delay for Organ Dysfunction  
 
If ren al dysfunction (creatinine ≥ 3  X institutional upper limit of normal) or hepatic 
dysfunction ( bilirubin ≥ 2.5  mg/dl or ALT/AST ≥ 3 X institutional upper limit of normal)  
occurs, therapy may not resume until the abnormalities have resolved to below the limits 
stated above. If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs during  a treat ment course, the next dose 
of decitabine should be held, and serum chemistries should be checked twice per week.  
Decitabine can be resumed when creatinine, bilirubin, ALT and AST are below the limits 
listed above.  
 
For grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicitie s, decitabine treatment should be delayed until 
recovery to baseline or to grade ≤ 1. For toxicities felt to be related to decitabine, decitabine 
may be reintroduced with a 50% dose reduction, or at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
6.3 Modification in Dose  or Schedule  
 
Once patients achieve morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery (CRi)  (morphologic leukemia -free state, defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate 
with marrow spicules and a count of  ≥ 200 nucleated cells and no bla sts with Auer rods, 
any persistence of extramedullary disease, or persistent pre -treatment morphologic 
abnormalities, such as pseudo -Pelger -Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, or dysplastic 
megakaryocytes) , administration may be decreased to 5 consecutive day s to limit 
myelosuppressive toxicity, per treating physician. After two cycles with bone marrow blast 
counts < 5% and no evidence of disease by cytogenetics or immunophenotype, patients 
may further decrease therapy to 3 consecutive days per cycle, per trea ting physician .

28 7.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
7.1 Decitabine  
 
Decitabine is an antimetabolite that can replace cytosine in DNA but, unlike cytosine, it 
cannot be methylated. The exact mechanism of decitabine activity has not been determined 
and may involve multiple pathways. Decitabine is thought primarily to act by correcting 
DNA methylation, a major mechanism for gene expression. In some cancer cells, 
hypermethylation blocks the activity of tumor suppressor genes, which regulate cell 
division and differentiation to prevent malignant transformation. When suppressor g ene 
activity is blocked, cell division becomes unregulated, leading to the formation of 
neoplastic cells. Decitabine regulates DNA methylation (specifically targets the 
methyltransferase , DNMT1 ), effectively demethylating and reactivating different tumor 
suppressor genes. Because hypermethylation occurs early in the malignant transformation 
of cells, decitabine may have activity in chemoprevention. Other possible mechanisms for 
decitabine activity include cytotoxicity due to incorporation into DNA similar t o other 
antimetabolites, methylation -independent induction of gene expression, and degradation of 
DNA methyltransferase 1.  
 
7.1.1 Study Drug Preparation  
 
OSHA Guidelines for handling cytotoxic drugs outlined in the American Journal 
of Hospital Pharmacy must be followed. 
 
Decitabine (5 -aza-2’-deoxycytidine) is supplied as a lyophilized powder for 
injection, 50 mg in 20 -ml vials. When reconstituted with 10 ml of sterile water for 
injection, each ml will contain 5 mg of decitabine and 6.8 mg of KH 2PO 4. The 
reconsti tuted solution should be diluted to 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL with pre -chilled 0.9% 
sodium chloride intravenous infusion, which has been cooled to 2 -8oC. 
Reconstitution of the powder results in a rapidly decomposing solution. Unless used 
within 15 minutes of reconstit ution, the diluted solution must be prepared using 
cold (2 —8 degrees C) infusion fluids and stored at 2 —8 degrees C (36 —46 degrees 
F) for a maximum of 7 hours.  
Decitabine will be administered per dosing schedule  every 28 ± 4 days.  
 
Decitabine may be admin istered either as an inpatient or an outpatient.  
 
7.1.2 Supplier  
 
Decitabine is available commercially.

30 8.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES SAMPLE COLLECTIONS  
 
Bone marrow samples  will be collected at Baseline, on Cycle 1 Day 10 ± 1 , and on Day 28  ± 4 of 
Cycle 1 and of even number cycles for correlative studies. Bone marrow aspirate (6 -10 ml) will be 
collected and divided between two EDTA (lavender top) tubes. The bone marrow samples and 
peripheral blood  samples should be delivered by hand to Sandra McDonald , M.D. PhD, director 
of the Tissue Procurement Core Facility at the Siteman Cancer Center.  At the Tissue Procurement 
Core Facility, patient identification will be removed from the samples, and the cel ls will be stored 
as frozen pellets in DMSO at 107 per tube. Subsequently, the samples will be thawed, and cells 
will be assayed.  
 
Peripheral blood sample  (3 mL) will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 4 ± 1.  Sample must be obtained 
45 minutes ± 15 minutes after  beginning the infusion, before the decitabine infusion is complete, 
and should be obtained from the opposite arm as the infusion.  The sample should be collected in 
a 3 mL K3EDTA tube pre -loaded with 8 mcL of tetrahydrouridine (THU 500 mcg/mL), an 
inhibit or of cytidine deaminase.  The sample should be processed by the Tissue Procurement Core 
Facility at the Siteman Cancer Center.  Serum should be separated and stored per protocols.

31 9.0 EFFICACY, SAFETY AND CORRELATIVE STUDY MEASURES  
 
A secondary  endpoint of this study is to estimate morphologic complete remission rate.  
  
9.1 Response Criteria  
 
Patients will be assessed for response according to the IWG criteria:1  
 
Morphologic complete remission  (CR)  – Defined as morphologic leukemia -free state, 
defined as less than 5% blasts in aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of ≥200 
nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods or any persis tence of extramedullary disease. 
When erythroid precursors constitute less than 50% of bone marrow nucleated cells, the 
percentage  of blasts is based on all nucleated cells; when there are 50% or more erythroid 
cells, the percentage blasts should be based on the nonerythroid cells. The presence of mild 
megaloblastoid changes may be permitted if they are thought to be consistent with 
treatment effect. However, persistence of pretreatment abnormalities (eg, pseudo -Pelger -
Hüet cells, ringed sideroblasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes) are not consistent with CR.   In 
addition, ANC >1000/μl and platelet count of ≥100,000/μl. Patient must be in dependent of 
transfusions. No duration requirement for this designation.  
 
Cytogenetic complete remission (CCR) – Defined as morphologic complete remission plus 
a reversion to a normal karyotype. For this study, reversion of a normal karyotype is 
defined as  no clonal abnormalities detected in a minimum of 20 mitotic cells.  
 
Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)  – Defined as 
morphologic complete recovery with the exception of neutropenia <1000/μl or 
thrombocytopenia <100,00 0/μl.  
 
Partial remission  (PR) – Requires that the above criteria for complete remission be met, 
with the following exceptions: decrease of ≥50% in the percentage of blast to 5 -25% in the 
bone marrow aspirate. A value of 5% blasts in bone marrow with Auer  rods present may 
also be considered a partial remission.  
 
Treatment failure – Includes all patients who did not achieve a complete or partial 
remission  following 4 cycles of therapy .  
 
Recurrence/morphologic relapse  - Relapse following complete remission  is defined as 
reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of ≥5% blasts in the bone marrow, not 
attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes are considered a relapse. If there 
are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5 -20% blasts in the  bone marrow, bone marrow 
biopsy should be repeated in > 1 week to confirm relapse.

32 9.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease  
 
Bone marrow biopsy should be performed at baseline for both the correlative  study and 
clinical  evaluation. Bone marrow biopsy should  be performed on Day 28  ± 4 of cycle 1  
and on Day 28 ± 4 of each even cycle for clinical disease assessment.  
 
Peripheral blood counts will be followed by weekly CBC with differential and platelets.   
After the first cycle, this may be changed to every other week  or monthly  at the discretion 
of the treating physician.  
 
9.3 Progressive Disease  
 
Progressive disease is defined as a clear increase in bone marrow blast count, typically a 
greater than 50% incre ase compared with baseline. Patients with progressive disease  will 
be removed from the study.  
 
Patients may also be removed from the study for progressive disease base d on evidence of 
new extramedullary disease or based on the clinical  judgment  of the treating physician . 
 
Patient s with a > 50% increase in peripheral blast count with an increase of the total 
peripheral white blood cell count to > 10,000/ l should undergo evaluation by bone 
marrow biopsy regardless of the cycle number.  
 
9.4 Other Secondary Ef ficacy Measures  
 
9.4.1 Overall Survival and Event-free Survival  
 
Overall survival  is defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death 
from any cause.  Patients still alive at the time of the final analysis will be right -
censored.  
 
Event -free survival  is defined as the interval from the date of first dose of study 
drug to date of treatment failure, recurrence, death due to any cause, or loss to 
follow up.  
 
9.4.2 Duration of Remission and Relapse -free Survival for Patients Having 
Complete Remission  
 
Duration of complete remission  is defined as the interval from  the date that 
complete remission is documented to the date of recurrence , death due to any cause , 
or loss to follow -up.  
 
Relapse -free survival  is defined only for those patients achieving a co mplete 
remission. It is defined as the interval from the date of first documentation of a

who receive at least one cycle of treatment.   
 
Safety  - The safety population will be defined as all pati ents with at least one dose of

12.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
12.2.1  Descriptive Analyses  
 
Patient Disposition : The number of patients discontinued, the reasons for 
discontinuation, and the number of cycles administered will be summarized.  
 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Descriptive summary statistics will 
be provided for demographic and important baseline characteristics.  For 
continuous variables, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum will be provided.  Fo r categorical variables, the number 
and percent of patients in each demographic/characteristic category will be 
summarized.  
 
12.2.2  Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 
The primary end -point of this phase II study is the correlation biomarkers with 
overall response in AML/ MDS patients to decitabine.  
 
We will correlate the presence of patient specific mutations  (especially mutations  
in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 ) with overall response rates. Mutation rates 
in these genes and in other patient -specific genes will be correlat ed with overall 
response and t heir respective 95% confidence intervals will be provided.  
 
Statistical considerations. The relationship between AML/MDS -associated 
mutations and the responsiveness to decitabine will be described by contingency 
tables and ass essed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. The 
differentially expressed genes between responders and non -responders will be 
determined using the significance analysis of microarray (SAM). Multivariate 
logistic regression will also b e fit to adjust the potential confounding effects of other 
demographic and clinical characteristics. The resultant critical P values will be 
corrected for multiple testing.  Since the Bonferroni correction is known too 
conservative, a permutation analysis (e.g., 10,000 random assignments for 
Genomic Predictors of Decitabine Response in AML/MDS  
 
Version date: 08/08/12  
39 responsive status) will be used to derive an empirical critical P value.  The new 
critical p -value is the number of permutation tests which yield a lower p -value than 
the original test divided by the total number of per mutation tests. [61]   
 
A power analysis was performed using Chi -square test for the association between 
mutation and response to decitabine. The frequency of DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and 
TET2 mutations in AML and MDS patients are each between 15% and 30% in 
multiple cohorts. [29-37] Table 3  shows the minimal detectable differences of 
response rates between mutant and wild -type cases, assuming an expected overall 
45% CR/CRi rate and 80% power. For an average of 20% frequency of a mutated 
gene, for example, 100 patients will provide 80% power to detect 30% difference 
at a 2 -sided 0.1 alpha error. The purpose of this study is to determine whether any 
of these mutations result in a 
clinically significant 
associat ion that would 
warrant pre -treatment testing. 
We believe that a reasonable 
cut off would be if at least 
30% of clinical response 
could be attributed to the 
presence of a specific 
mutation. However, we 
anticipate that more power 
could be achieved as we 
assess patient groups with 
combined characteristics 
(e.g. DNMT3A mutation or 
loss of DNMT3A expression). 
In addition, we expect that 
the majority of the enrolled 
125 patients can be used in the analysis (since all of our molecular information will 
be acquired within 30 days of enrollment, we anticipate a drop -out rate of 20% or 
less).  
 
12.2.3  Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
 
The overall response rate (CR/CRi/PR) and complete response rate (CR/CRi) will 
be compared with historical controls [2], and the 95% confidence intervals will be 
provided.  
 
The rate of patient spe cific mutation clearance after 10, 30, and 60  days of therapy 
will be determined using an Illumina bas ed platform. We will compare the rate of 
mutation clearance between the patients who achieve a CR/CRi after 4 cycles and 
those who do not.  We anticipate that we will identify between 6 and 25 exonic 
SNVs per case (the range obtained with >200 AML samples s equenced to date with 
whole genome or exome sequencing), and that the expected 95% confidence Table 3 . Detectable mutation associated response rates  (80% power, α = 0.05)

40 interval of the mean variant allele frequency will be ±2.56% and ±1.25%, 
respectively, if we assume an anticipated standard deviation of 3.2% within the 
same clon e. The change of tumor burden over time and its association with clinical 
response will  be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated measurement data, 
followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group differences (e.g., 
responders vs. non -respon ders) at given time points as well as the between -time 
differences within each group. The resultant critical P values will also be corrected 
using permutation analysis for multiple testing.  
 
The steady -state serum decitabine concentration on day 4 ± 1 will  be measured and 
correlated with clinical overall response.  
 
The percent decrease in peripheral blood methylcytosine will be calculated on day 
10±1. We will compare this reduction with previously published data and between 
the patients who achieve CR/CRi a nd those who do not.  The correlation of peak 
serum levels with response will be assessed using 2 -sample t -test or Mann -Whitney 
non-parametric rank -sum test as appropriate. The change of total bone marrow 
DNA methylcytosine from baseline and its association  with both steady -state serum 
drug levels and response will be assessed using 2 -way ANOVA for repeated 
measurement data, followed by the ad -hoc multiple comparisons for between -group 
differences (e.g., responders vs. non -responders) and between -time differ ences. 
Similar analyses will be performed for the correlation of expression profiles and 
SNP analysis with pharmacokinetic data.   
 
Statistical power justification.   A power analysis was performed using two -sample 
t-test for between -group difference and paired t -test for the change over time. For 
tumor clearance, this will provide > 99% power to detect a 10% difference in the 
means at two separate time points for clo nes with 6 or more variants, and > 98% 
power to detect a 15% difference if there are 3 or more variants per clone with α = 
0.05 (power will decrease to 91% and 82%, respectively, in cases where the 
standard deviation is 4.7%, the maximum we have observe d thus far). For 
pharmacologic correlations, we anticipate 85% power to determine a 25 ng/ml 
difference between the average C max of 45 evaluable responders and 55 evaluable 
non-responders with an anticipated average C max of 70 ng/ml and a standard 
deviation o f 40 ng/ml within the entire cohort, and with α = 0.05. [22] We believe a 
less significant difference would n ot be sufficient to warrant application in clinical 
decision making (i.e. whether to continue therapy for more than 1 cycle). We 
anticipate 99% power to determine a difference of 20% in the reduction of bone 
marrow methylcytosine between 45 evaluable respo nders and 55 evaluable non -
responders with an expected standard deviation of 15% and α = 0.05. [28, 66-68] 
The difference in methylcytosine reduction previously observed was 30% between 
patients achieving CR/PR and those  with only hematologic improvement. [28]  
 
Time to relapse and time to death will also be listed for each patient.

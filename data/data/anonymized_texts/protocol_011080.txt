CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 2of 154VERSION HISTORY
Version 1.0, 25 June 2020
Initial creation
Version 2.0, 30 July 2020
The protocol was revised to address the FDA  recommendations received on 17 and 28 July 2020:
Section 8.3.13.1 was updated to reflect changes in the haematologic toxicity dose modifications 
management. 
 Table 11 was revised to reflect the following: 
 A second instance of Grade 3 neutropenia with documented infection and/or fever should 
result in adavosertib discontinuation. 
However, it is proposed that in exceptional circumstances, the investigator/treating 
physician may consider continuing dosing at dose level -2 only when the benefits are 
considered to outweigh the risks and after approval by the Medical Monitor . 
 Table 12 was revised to reflect the following: 
 Further dose reduction to dose level -2 on a third instance of Grade 2 thrombocytopenia. 
 Action for all events of Grade 2 thrombocytopenia should be taken when the sample was 
obtained at pre -dose assessment, rather than during the cycle. 
 Discontinuation of adavosertib on a third instance of Grade 3 thro mbocytopenia.
However, it is proposed that in exceptional circumstances, for example, when a patient is 
objectively benefiting from several cycles of treatment and the investigator/treating 
physician considers that the benefit to the patient of continuing on treatment outweighs the 
risks, that the dose be resumed at dose level -2 after approval by the Medical Monitor .
 Table 13 was revised to provide further guidance on dose interruption and dose reduction steps 
if the patient has a recurrent Hb <9 but ≥8 g/dL.
Sections 8.3.13.2 and 8.3.13.3 were updated to provide additional clarity on the management of 
non-haematologic toxicities, with detailed information on dose modifications for the management of 
gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities.
 New tables were added to provide clarity on the management of non -haematologic toxicities 
(Table 14), with detailed information on dose modifications for the management of diarrhoea 
(Table 16) and nausea and vomiting (Table 17).

8.3.13.3 (CSPv1) was deleted.
The option of the third dose reduction has been removed and text revised in Sections 1.1, 6.6 
(including Table 9) and 8.3.13.
Sections 1.1, 4.1, and 9.4.1.1 were updated to clarify that m aturity of data will also be taken into 
account when selecting the date for primary analysis.
Section 9.4.1.2 was updated to clarify that a separate analysis will be performed using those 
confirmed responders that have been followed for a minimum o f 6 months after response and using 
all confirmed responders regardless of follow -up time.
Sections 4.1 and 8.6.1.1 were updated to clarify that all diagnostic tumor tissue samples should be 
submitted, not only if the diagnostic sample is different from the 
Section 4.1 Figure 2 was updated to reflect a change in tumor assessment frequency from “every 
6weeks for the first 24 weeks ” to every “6 weeks for the first 48 weeks. ”
Section 4.1.1 and Appendix J were added to include guidance on how the study could continue in 
the event of a serious disruption due to cases of civil crisis, natural disaster, or public health crisis 
with details on mitigation that could be employed to ensure study continuity .
Section 9.5.1 was updated to add addit ional detail regarding the Safety Review Committee.
Appendix A  was updated to remove reference to CT/MRI of the liver and adrenal glands, as this is 
not applicable for this study .
Version 3.0, 20 April 2021
The protocol was revised to address the recommendations of the Safety Review Committee received 
on 9thApril 2021.
Recommendation 1: Additional safety haematology and clinical chemistry assessment along on -site 
visit on Day 15 (+/ -1 day window) in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. Safety haematology and cli nical 
chemistry assessment along on- site visit on Day 5 (+/ -1 day window) in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, in 
addition to the PK samples already collected. Section 1.3 Table 1, Section 8.2.4 and Section 8.3.13.1 
were updated to reflect this recommendation.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 4of 154Recommendation 2: Review of the Toxicity Management Guidelines for participants with CTCAE 
Grade 4 infection with Grade 4 neutropenia, to allow participants who recover and have clear 
clinical benefit that outweighs the risks to continue dosing (at a reduc ed dose), only after sponsor 
approval. Section 8.3.13.1 Table 11 was updated to reflect this recommendation.
Recommendation 3: Additional guidance in Toxicity Management Guidelines for the G -CSF use in 
sever e neutropenia. Section 8.3.13.1 was updated to r eflect this recommendation. 
Section 8 was updated in view of the additional laboratory assessments required, to increase the
amount of blood collected from each participant accordingly . 
Section 8.3.13.1 Tables 11, 12,13,14,15,16 and 17 dose level reductions have been updated for 
clarity to ‘next reduced dose level ’, to account for the fact that participants may have previously had 
a dose level reduction due to another toxicity . 
Version 4.0, 08 Nov 2021
The protocol was revised in line with the urgent safety measures implemented on 29thOctober 2021. 
Based on a preliminary analysis, AstraZeneca identified an association between reduced renal 
function and the risk of Grade 4 neutropenia. Risk minimization measures implemented regarding 
renal function.
Section 1.3 Table 1 and Section 8.2.4 updated to include creatinine clearance calculation at each 
study visit where clinical chemistry is assessed.
  
Section 2.3.1: Update to risk assessment section to include sepsis as an identified risk. IB (section 
5.4) will be updated with DCO Nov -2021.  
Section 5.1: Update to threshold for Creatinine Clearance within inclusion criterion 9.   
Section 5.2: Supplemental exclusion criterion specifically relating to infection. 
Section 8.3.13.1 Toxicity management guidelines for Blood neutrophil count decrease updated for 
first and third occurrence of Grade 3 neutropenia. Recommendation of prophy lactic antibiotics and 
G-CSF in case of severe neutropenia/febrile neutropenia added. Recommendation of secondary 
prophylaxis by G -CSF in participants who had severe neutropenia in a previous cycle.
Section 8.3.13.3 Toxicity management guidelines for moder ate/severe renal impairment (low 
creatinine clearance) added.

1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase 2b, Open -label, Single -arm, Mul ti-centre Study  assessing the Efficacy 
and Safety  of Adavosertib as Treatment for Recurrent or Persistent Uterine Serous Carcino ma 
(ADAGIO)
Short Title: Phase 2b Study  of Adavosertib as Treatment for Uterine Serous Carcinoma
Rationale: 
There i s an important unmet medical need for treatments in uterine serous carcino ma (USC), 
an aggressive variant of endo metrial carcino ma, with an increased likelihood of recurrence 
and limited treatment options; the overall 5 -year survival for USC is est imated to be only 35 
to 50% for women wit h Stage I -II disease and 0 to 15% for women with Stage III -IV disease. 
Data from The Cancer Geno me At las (TCGA) have shown that USC exhibits several genet ic 
alterati ons that coul d make this variant more likely to respond to WEE1 kinase inhibit ion. 
Specifically , USC exhibit s high rates of mutation in TP53 (up to 90 to 92% of cases) as well 
as high rates of mutation or amplification in other cell cycle regulators, including CCNE1 , 
FBXW7 , MYC , RB1, CCND1 , TAF1, and KRAS/NRAS .
This Phase 2b study  aims to eval uate the efficacy  and safet y of adavosertib, an inhibitor of the 
tyrosine kinase WEE1, in participants with recurrent or persi stent U SC who have previously 
received at least 1 prior platinum based chemotherapy  regimen for the management of USC.
Objectives and Endpoints
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
 To evaluate the efficacy of adavosertib 
by the assessment of objective response 
rate (ORR). ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with 
measurable disease at baseline who have a confirmed 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as 
determined by Blinded Independent Central Review 
(BICR) per RECIST v1.1.
Secondary
 To ev aluate efficacy of adavosertib by 
assessment of duration of response 
(DoR). DoR is defined as the time from the date of first 
documented response until date of documented 
progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR, or 
death in the absence of disease p rogression.

Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 14of 154 To evaluate efficacy of adavosertib by 
assessment of depth of response. Depth of response is defined as the best percentage 
change from baseline in Target Lesions.
 To evaluate the efficacy of adavosertib 
by assessment of progression -free 
survival (PFS). PFS is defined as time from date of first dose until 
progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by BICR, or 
death due to any cause. 
 To evaluate the efficacy of adavosertib 
by assessment of PFS6. PFS6 is defined as the proportion of participa nts alive 
and progression free at 6 months, and will be reported 
as the Kaplan -Meier estimate of PFS per RECIST v1.1 
as assessed by BICR at 6 months.
 To evaluate the efficacy of adavosertib 
by assessment of overall survival (OS). OS is defined as time fro m date of first dose until the 
date of death due to any cause.
 To evaluate the efficacy of adavosertib 
by assessment of disease control rate 
(DCR). DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who 
have a best overall response of CR or PR or who have 
stable disease for at least 5 weeks after start of 
treatment (to allow for an early assessment within the 
assessment window).
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 
adavosertib. Plasma concentration of adavosertib: C trough (pre-dose)
and C max.
 To assess the safety and tolerability of 
adavosertib in participants with USC. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated in terms of 
AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, 
and AEs leading to dose interruptions, dose reductions, 
and dose discontinuation s.
 Vital signs parameters include systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, and pulse as well as heart rate, body 
temperature, body weight, height, and BMI.
 Laborato ry parameters include clinical chemistry and 
haematology parameters as well as urinalysis.

This Phase 2b, single -arm, mul ti-centre study  will assess the efficacy and safet y of adavosertib 
in eligible participants with histologically confirmed recurrent or persistent USC (for the 
purposes of this study , this includes parti cipants with endometrial carcino ma of mixed 
histol ogy where the serous component comprises at least 10% of th e tumour [ McMeekin et al 
2007]), evidence of measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1, and who have received at l east1 
prior platinum based chemotherapy  regimen for the m anagement of USC. Participants with 
carcinosarcomas are not eligible. There is no restriction on the number of prior lines of 
systemic therapy  a parti cipant m ay have previ ously  received, and the platinum based
chemotherapy may  have been given in the adjuva nt setting. 
Parti cipants are requi red to provi de a form alin-fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumour

Statistical methods
The All Pat ients Set will include all participants who have signed the informed consent form 
(ICF) (ie, screening failures plus participants dosed) and will be used to d escribe the patient 
disposi tion. The Full Analysis Set (F AS) and the Centrally Confirmed Analysis Set (CCAS) 
will both be used for all analyses of the efficacy endpoints, and the F AS will be used for the 
safet y endpo ints. The F AS will include all participa nts who received at least one (non -zero) 
dose of study  treatm ent. The CCAS includes all centrally confi rmed USC parti cipants who 
received at least one (non -zero) dose of study  treatment. The Pharmacokinet ics Analysis Set 
will include all dosed participants who had at least one measurable plasma concentration 
collected post -dose which was obtained without any deviat ion or event thought to 
significant ly affect the PK analysis.
The primary  endpoint of ORR (defined as the percentage of participants with a confi rmed 
complete response [CR] or partial response [PR], based on a subset of all treated participants 
with measurable disease at baseline per Blinded Independent Central Review [BICR]), and its 
90% and 95% confidence interval (CI) (Clopper- Pearson) will be summarized. .Summaries of 
ORR will be based on imaging BICR; ORR per investigator review will be a sensit ivity 
analysis. The primary analysis will be performed, in both the F AS and centrally confirmed 
USC popul ations, 6 months after the last patient first d oseor when all participants have 
progressed or died due to any  cause, whichever is earlier . Maturi ty of durati on of  response 
(DoR) data will also be taken into accoun t when select ing the data cut -off (DCO) date for 
primary  analysis No further analyses wil l be performed beyo nd the primary analysis.
An interim analysis is planned after approximately 30 participants in the CCAS have had the 
opportunit y to be treated for at least 4 months. Recruitment will not be paused whilst the 
participants required for t he interim are evaluated. 
A comprehensive statist ical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and will include a more 
technical and detailed description o f the stati stical analyses. A  Cont inuous Monitoring Plan 
(CMP) will also be produced to describe the ap proach, decisio n criteria, statist ical analyses 
and co mmunicat ion plan for conti nuous m onitoring in this study .
Descript ive statistics will be used for all variables. Continuous variables will be summarised 
by the number of observat ions, m ean, standard dev iation, median, minimum and maximum.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 31of 1542 INTRODUCTION
Adavosertib (AZD1775) is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase WEE1. AstraZeneca is 
develo ping adavosertib for use as monotherapy  and in combinat ion with other anti cancer 
agents for a range of therapeutic indicat ions, including recurrent or persistent 
advanced/metastatic uterine serous carcino ma (USC) and other advanced so lid tumours.
2.1 Study Rat ionale
This Phase 2b study  aims to eval uate the efficacy  and safet y of adavosertib in partici pants
with recurrent or persi stent USC who have previously received at least 1 prior platinum based
chemotherapy regimen for the management of USC. The rationale for conducting the study  is 
supported by  the fo llowing:
Unmet medical need: USC is an aggressive variant of endom etrial  carcino ma, wi th an 
increased likelihood of recurrence and limited treatment options, with the overall 5 -year 
survival for USC estimated to be only 35- 50% for women wit h Stage I -II disease, and 
0-15% for women with Stage III- IV disease (Achary aet al 2005) 
Mechanism of act ion of adavosertib (see Sect ion2.2.3 )
: data from The Cancer Geno me 
Atlas (TCGA) have shown that USC exhibits several genet ic alterations that could make 
this variant more likely to respond to WEE1 kinase inhibit ion. Specifically , USC exhibi ts 
high rates of mutation in TP53 (up to 90 -92% of cases) in co mbinat ion with high rates of 
mutati on or am plificat ion in other cell cycle regulators, including CCNE1, FBXW 7, MYC, 
RB1, CCND1, TAF1, and KRAS/NRAS (Cancer Geno me Atlas Research Network 2013 , 
Zhao etal2013) 
Clinical data fro m an ongo ing Phase 2 clinical study o f adavosertib in participants with 
recurrent or persistent USC: preliminary object ive response rate (ORR) of 29.4% 
(95% CI: 15.1%, 47.5%; n=34) 
(Liuet al 2020) 
The background to the rationale is summarised below in Sect ions2.2and
 2.3.
2.2 Background
A detailed descript ion of the chemistry , pharmaco logy, efficacy , and safet y of adavosertib i s 
provi ded in the Invest igator ’s Brochure.
2.2.1 Endometrial Cancer and Uterine Serous Carcinoma
Endometrial cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the female genital tract with 
over 380000 new cases worldwide in 2018 ( Bray etal2018), and an estimated 61880 new 
cases diagnosed in the United States (US) in 2019 
(Siegel etal2019). Ther e is an increasing 
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 32of 154prevalence in developed countries and the highest incidences have been observed in the US, 
Canada, and Northern and Western Europe ( Bray etal2018). From  2006 to 2015, the 
incidence rate increased by  about 1% per y ear and fro m 2007 to 2016, the death rate increased 
by about 2% per y ear 
(Amer ican Cancer Society2019 ).
USC i s one of the l ess comm on variants of endometri al cancer. However, despite represent ing 
only approximately 10% of all endometrial cancer diagnoses, it accounts for up to 39% of 
endo metrial cancer -related deaths ( Hamilt onet al 2006). Unlike the more commo n 
endo metrioid variants of uterine cancer, the majority  of wom en wi th USC have a high ri sk of 
relapse, even in the absence of tradit ional “high -risk” features, suc h as myo metri al invasi on or 
lymphovascular invo lvement, and USC histology is considered to be high -risk and high -grade 
by default in the National Co
mprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines ( NCCN 2019). 
The overall 5
-year survival for USC is est imated to be only 35 -50% for women wit h Stage I -II 
disease, and 0 -15% for women with Stage III- IV disease ( Acharya et al 2005) . 
2.2.2 Current Standard of Care
Treatment options for these cancers are limited. Currently, the preferred standard of care for 
participants with recurrent, metastatic, or high risk endo metrial cancer is combinat ion 
chemotherapy wit h carboplat in and paclitaxel ( NCCN 2019). More recently, targeted 
therapi es specifically for USC have been explored, but results thus far have been 
disappoint ing. One area of great interest has been targeting of HER2/neu, which has been 
reported to be highly expressed in between 17 and 50% of women wit h USC 
(Talwar and 
Cohen 2012), and case reports of trastuzumab activit y have been reported (Santin etal2008 ; 
Talwar and Cohen 2012). A case report describes the clinical response of a heavily pre -treated 
patient wi th a recurrent USC, overexpressing HER2/neu at 3+ level by immunohistochemistry  
(IHC), to anti -HER2/neu ant ibody-drug-conjugate trastuzum ab-emtansine (TDM -1) wi th 
complete resol ution of a large metastatic, radiat ion/chemotherapy resistant tumour 
(Santin et 
al 2017 ). However, a Gynecologic Onco logy Group study  of single -agent trastuzumab in 
33wom en wi th HER2 -positive endo metrial cancer (of whom  11 had USC) di d not 
demonstrate si gnificant acti vity, wi th no wom en achieving a tumour response 
(Fleming et al 2010). A recent study  (Fader et al 2018 ) com pared carbopl atin-paclitaxel wit h 
and wit hout trastuzumab in participants with primary  advanced or recurrent HER2/neu-
positive USC ( defined by  an IHC score of 3+ or 2+ with gene amplification confirmed by  
fluorescence in situ hybridizat ion,and with a serous component of ≥10%) reported increased 
progression -free survival (PFS) for participants treated wi th the combinat ion compared to 
those on the carboplat in-pacli taxel  control  arm; medi an PFS was 8.0 m onths (carboplat in-
paclitaxel) versus 12.6 months (carboplat in-pacli taxel -trastuzum ab; p=0.005; hazard ratio:
0.44; 90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26, 0.76). Further invest igation of these result s is 
needed to determine the impact on overall survival (OS) in this patient populat ion.

inhibitor (pembro lizumab) or co- inhibit ion of angiogenesis (via vascular endothelial growth 
factor -mediated suppressio n; lenvatinib) and PD -1 signalling is emerging as an efficacious 
anti-tumour strategy  for the treatment of endo metrial cancer ( Makker et al 2019 ). 
KEYNOTE -146/Study  111 assessed l envat inib/pembrolizumab co mbinat ion in participants
with advanced endom etrial carcino ma. In the 94 participants with tumours that were not 
microsatellite instabilit y high (MSI -H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), the combinat ion 
demonstrated an ORR of 38.3% (95% CI: 29%, 49%), with a complete response (CR) rate of 
10.6% (n=10) and a partial response (PR) rate of 27.7% (n=26) 
(FDA 2019, Makker et al 
2019). In the US, the FDA has recently approved pem brolizumab for the subset of women 
with MSI -H, m etastati c disease, and the combinat ion of pembro lizumab/lenvatinib for the 
treatm ent of participants with advanced endom etrial  carcino ma that i s not MSI -H or dMMR, 
who have disease progression fo llowing pri orsystemic therapy and are not candidates for 
curative surgery  or radi ation 
(FDA 2019).
Deficient mismatch repair has been reported in 33.5% (n=65/194) of endo metrioid tumours 
and 1.6% (n=1/61) of serous tumours 
(Aghajanian et al 2018 ), and MSI -H in 40% of 
endo metrioid tum ours and 2% of serous tumours ( Cancer Geno me Atlas Research 
Network 2013). While USC participants are thus predominant ly microsatellite stable (not 
MSI-H), several ongo ing studies are exploring the addit ion of a PD -1/programmed death -
ligand 1 (PD -L1) inhibitor to standard of care combinat ion chemotherapy  in the first -line 
advanced disease setting (clintrials.gov), and new treatments potentially beyo nd the use of 
PD-1/PD -L1 are urgently needed. Durvalumab wit h or wi thout ol aparib, as mai ntenance 
therapy  after first -line treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer (DUO -E; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), is current ly being invest igated. Therefore, USC still represents an area of 
unmet medical need. 
2.2.3 Adavosertib
Adavosertib is an inhibitor of WEE1, a protein ty rosine kinase. WEE1 phosphorylates and 
inhibits cyclin -dependent kinase 1 and 2 (CDK1 and CDK2) and is invo lved in regulat ion of 
the intra -S and G2 cell cycle checkpoints. Proper funct ioning of these checkpo ints is essent ia
l 
for DNA metabo lism and the DNA damage response ( Coleman and Dunphy 1994, Parker and 
Piwnica -Worms1992).
Activity of CDK1 (also called cell divisio n cycle 2 protein, or CDC2) drives a cell fro m the 
G2 phase o f the cell cycle into mitosis. In response to DNA damage, WEE1 inhibits CDK1 to 
prevent the cell fro m dividing unt il the damaged DNA is repaired (G2 checkpoint arrest).  
CDK2 activit y drives a cell into, and through, S -phase of the cell cycle in which the geno me is 
duplicated in preparation for cell divisio n.  Inhibit ion of WEE1 is expected to cause aberrant ly 
high CDK2 act ivity in S-phase cells t hat, in turn leads to unstable DNA replicat ion structures 
and ult imately DNA damage.
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 34of 154Inhibit ion of WEE1 is expected to release a tumour cell fro m DNA damage induced arrest at 
the G2/M boundary , so that unrepai red DNA damage m ay be taken into mitosi s (M-phase).  
Since cancer cells exhibit higher levels o f endogenous damage than normal cells, as well as 
exhibit ing loss of 1 or m ore DNA damage response capabilit ies, this is expected to 
preferentially enhance cancer cell death through mitotic catastrophe compar ed to norm al cells.  
In the nonclinical setting, adavosertib has demo nstrated significant single -agent ant i-tumour 
activit y in cancer cell models associated with high levels o f endogenous replication stress 
resul ting fro m a combinat ion of G1/S checkpo int deficiencies due to p53 m utations or 
CDKN2A deletions and the over -expressio n of oncogenic drivers such as MYC, mutant 
KRAS or the amplificat ion of Cyclin E. 
As USC exhibits high rates of mutation in TP53 (up to 90 -92% of cases) in co mbinat ion with 
high rates of mutation or am plificati on in other cell cycle regulators, including CCNE1 , 
FBXW7 , MYC , RB1, CCND1 , TAF1 and KRAS/NRAS (Cancer Geno me Atlas Research 
Network 2013, Zhao et al 2013 ), this tum our ty pe is expected to have high levels of 
replicat ion stress and endogenous DNA damage, and is therefore expected to be sensit ive to 
WEE1 kinase inhibit ion. 
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
2.3.1 Risk Assessment
As of 11 November 2021, approximately 2083 participants have received adavosertib in its 
clinical development program, with approximately 349 participants receiving adavosertib 
monotherapy in Ast raZeneca sponsored and Merck sponsored studies. 
Based on the safet y data fro m completed adavosertib clinical studies and preliminary data 
from ongoing studies, ident ified risks (reported by  ≥10% of participants ) to adavoserti b 
monotherapy  include diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomit ing, difficult y with digesti on, decreased 
appeti te, a decreased number of red blood cells/haemoglobin level, neutrophils and platelets in 
the blood. Other identified risks include s epsis and febrile neutropenia . 
Sepsis has recently been categorised as an ident ified risk wit h adavosertib therapy . 
Adavosertib has a well characterised safet y profile, and the toxicit y is considered manageable 
with effective toxicit y management, including dose delays, dose reductions, intermittent 
dosing and/or the use of supportive care approach in the participants with poor tol erance. 
More detailed informat ion about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected adverse events (AEs) of adavosertib may  be found in S ections 5 and 6 of the current 
adavosertib IB.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 35of 1542.3.2 Benefit Assess ment
Liu et al  (Liuetal2020 ) recent ly assessed the activit y of adavosertib as monotherapy  in 
recurrent U SC (n=34, evaluable) in an ongoing Phase 2 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). A preliminary 
ORR of 29.4% (95% CI: 15.1%, 47.5%), including 9 partial responses (8 confirmed and 
1unconfirmed) and 1 complete response, was observed. The median PFS time was reported to 
be 6.14 m onths (95% CI: 4.21 months, 9.92 months), and the proportion of participants
progression -free at 6 months (PFS6) was 59.6% (95% CI: 40.6%, 74.3%). The m edian 
durati on of  response (DoR) was 9.03 months (95% CI: 5.29 months, NA).
2.3.3 Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
Treatment options for USC are limit ed (see Section 2.2.2 ), with poor 5 -year estimated OS 
(35-50%, Stage I -II disease; 0 -15% Stage III -IV disease;
 Achary aetal2005). Overall, based 
on the available clinical efficacy and safet y data and the limited long
-term efficacy  provided 
by the current ly available treatment options f or USC, the benefi t/risk assessment supports the 
proposed invest igation of the therapeutic efficacy of adavosertib in participants with USC in 
second line plus setting.

4.1 Overall Design
This Phase 2b, single -arm, mul ti-centre study  will assess the efficacy and safet y of adavosertib 
in eligible participants with histol ogically confirmed recurrent or persistent USC (for the 
purposes of this study , this includes parti cipants with endometrial carcino ma of mixed 
histol ogy where the serous component comprises at least 10% of the tumour [ McMeekin et al 
2007]), evidence of measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1, and who have received at least 1 
pri
or platinum based chem otherapy  regimen for the m anagement of USC. Participants with 
carcin osarcomas are not eligible.
Parti cipants are requi red to provi de a form alin-fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tumour 
sample , collected as part of routine clinical pract ice, for central testing and central 
confirmat ion of USC diagnosis. This should preferably be an FFPE tissue block, or if not 
possible, freshly -cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the most recently collect ed tumour 
tissue that should be a sufficient quantit y to allow for the central confirmation o f USC and 
 (Section 8.6.1.1 ). For the US C central confirmat ion, haematoxylin and 
eosin (HE) -stained slide(s) of the sample used by the site for eligibilit y shoul d also be 
submitted. Further details on tissue specificat ions are outlined in the Pathology  Manual ,

4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
Adavosertib is under investigat ion by AstraZeneca for a range of therapeut ic indicat ions 
including recurrent or persi stent advanced USC and other advanced so lid tumours. Given its 
mechanism o f action (see Sect ion2.2.3 ) and benefit/risk assessment (see Section 2.3), there is 
strong rationale for the evaluation o f adavosert ib in participants with USC in the second- line 
and bey ond treatm ent setting where standard of care treatment options ar e limi ted.
The single -arm, open -label study  design is a standard design for a Phase 2 study  where the 
primary  object ive of the study  is to assess efficacy (ORR, as determined by imaging Blinded 
Independent Central Review [BICR]) of adavosertib.
The eligibi lity criteria have been desi gned to recruit a patient population that is representative 
of those wi th recurrent or persi stent USC, and who have received at least 1 prior platinum 
based chem otherapy  regimen for the m anagement of USC (the platinum based chem otherapy  
may have been received in the adjuvant setting). 
4.3 Justification for Dose
The study  was init iated wi th a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of adavosertib  300 mg QD 
for 5 days fo llowed by  2 days off in Weeks 1 and 2 out of a 21- day schedule .This dos e and 
schedule were established based on the safety , PK and clinical activit y observed in PN011 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), REFMAL 398 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and a Phase 2 study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
Clinica l Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 42of 154PN011 and REFMAL 398 were Phase 1 studies designed to determine the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD)/RP2D for adavosertib mo notherapy  using different dose levels and schedules as 
well as QD and twice daily  (BID) dosing ( Takebe etal2018, Falchook etal2019). Steady -
state pl asma concentration at the 300 mg dose was above that required to pr ovide the 
necessary  IC 50for phosphorylated CDK1 activit y that had been determined preclinically as 
well as being within the preclinically
-defined targeted cell kill range (500 to 1000 nM) for 
approximately  16hours post -dose, supporting adequate target co verage.
The preclinical dose -PK-PD-efficacy modelling , based on two independent animal cancer 
models and the m athemat icalmodelling l ooking at the bio logically  effective dose for 
adavosertib mo notherapy  activit y,has confirmed thekey factors for dose dec ision inthe order 
of importance are asfollows: dose, foll owed by the number of days of consecutive treatment, 
followed by the length of the treatment gap. The latter two are important because both in 
preclinical animal models, and in the early clinical experience, thedose of adavosertib 
requi red to provi de efficacy  coul d not be sustained as a con tinuous treatment schedule and 
therefore an intermittent sch edule was needed for RP2D.  Mult iple intermittent schedules were 
assessed in preclinical animal models including 5days on/2days off, 7days on/7days off, 5days 
on/9days off or 3days on/4days off.
These preclinical data ident ified that:
1The pharmacokinet ics of adavosertib on single or repeat dose in the mouse could be 
accurately modelled.
2Preclinical doses of between 60 mg /kgQD and 90 mg/kg QD were effect ive in inducing 
tumour regressi on across m ultiple m odels.
3Time and dose dependence of pCDK1 and RRM2 expr ession (a surrogate of CDK2 
activat ion) could be modelled with a single IC 50value of 0.273 μM total plasma 
concentration.
4The changes in pCDK1 and RRM2 could be related to the dose and schedule dependence 
of efficacy where it was estimated that plasma concentrati ons above 0.5 μM were 
requi red for anti -tumor activi ty, with maximal  tumor cell kill rate achieved at 
approximately  1 μM.
5Different doses and schedules provide a consistent relat ionship between efficacy , dose 
level and number of days dosed but is g reater than linear at the highest dose (90 mg/kg) 
while a schedule of 5 days on 2 day s off represented the optimal intermittent schedule in 
terms of efficacy  and preclinical  safety  studies.
6The preclinical efficacious doses of adavosertib of between 60 mg/kg and 90 mg/kg are 
equivalent to the free drug exposures obtained by the clinical QD doses of 250 mg and 
300 m g QD respect ively.

Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 43of 154Clinical act ivity of adavosertib as monotherapy  was evaluated at RP2D in recurrent USC 
(n=34, evaluable) in an ongoing Pha se 2 study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ( Liuet al 2020 ). A 
preliminary ORR of 29.4% (95% CI: 15.1%, 47.5%), including 9 partial responses 
(8confirmed and 1 unconfirmed) and 1 complet e response, was observed. The median PFS 
time was reported to be 6.14 months (95% CI: 4.21 months, 9.92 months), and the PFS6 was 
59.6% (95% CI: 40.6%, 74.3%). The median DoR was 9.03 months (95% CI: 5.29 months, 
NA). The most frequently observed AEs inclu ded di arrhoea (85%), anaemia (65%), fat igue 
(65%), and nausea (62%).
As of 11 November 2021, 101 participants have been dosed at 300mg QD adavosertib in the 
ADAGIO study . The study is ongo ing, and hence the data presented below is not fully  cleaned 
and subject to change. Overall, 96 (95.0%) participants have experienced TEAEs. The most 
commo n (≥ 30%) TEAEs were diarrhoea (63 [62.4%] participants ), nausea (60 [59.4%] 
participants ), anaemia (49 [48.5%] participants ), fatigue (39 [38.6%] participants ), 
thrombocytopenia (37 [36.6%], constipat ion (37 [36.6%] participants ), neutropeni a (36 
[35.6%] participants ) and asthenia (36 [35.6%] participants ). Overall, 40 (39.6%) participants
have experienced SAEs; those experienced by > 1 (1.0%) patient were neutrophil 
count 
decreased (4 [4.0%] participants ); neutropeni a, dy spnoea, pulmo nary embolism, and sepsis (3 
[3.0%] participants each); and vo miting, fat igue, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, syncope, pleural 
effusio n, embo lism, hypotension, and acute kidney injury (2 [2.0%] participants each). Forty
participants (39.6%) had an adverse event leading to dose reduction. 
At the time of this DCO ,five cases of sepsis in the ADAGIO study  were reported; three 
events recovered, and two events were fatal. Four of these five sepsis cases (including the two 
fatal cases) were associated with Grade 4 neutropenia, which occurred within the first two 
cycles of treatm ent and these four cases had either a baseline or on -study  decrease in 
creatinine clearance to <50 ml/min. Both fatal ities (Grade 5 biliary sepsis [not related to 
adavosertib per invest igator]; Grade 5 urosepsis [related to adavosertib per invest igator]) 
occurred in pat ients who had a pre -existing infect ion (biliary) or a specific predilection for 
infect ious com plicat ions (vesico -vaginal fistula).
To understand the relat ionship of adavosert ib exposure and severe haematological events in 
monotherapy  treatm ent, a pool ed exposure
-safet y analysis was perform ed and showed that 
there is a strong correlat ion between adavosertib plasma exposure, and the predicted 
probabilit y of Grade ≥3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The predicted probabilit y of 
neutropeni a and thrombocy topeni a increases as adavosertib plasma exposure increases. The 
model predicted probability of developing neu tropenia (Grade ≥ 3) at m edian and 95th 
percent ile of AUCss after 300 mg QD dosing is 12.9% and 45.0 %, respectively, while at 250 
mg QD dosing it is 10.6 % and 20.4 %, respectively. This indicates approximately 18% and 
55% reduction of predicted probabili ty of neutropenia at 50thand 95th percent ile of exposure, 
respectively , when the dose i s reduced to 250 mg QD from 300 mg QD, irrespective of

benefit is expected to be maintained at the reduced dose of 250 mg. 
A starting dose of adavosertib at 250 mg QD (5 days on, 2 day s off in Weeks 1 and 2 out of a 
21-day schedule) is re commended for adavosertib mo notherapy  clinical  devel opment.  Thi s 
assessment i s based on the preclinical efficacy findings, overall tolerabilit y profile, frequency  
of dose reducti ons due to AEs reported at 300 mg QD, exposure -safet y analyses, and the 
reduc ed predicted occurrence of severe neutropenia and sepsis wit h lower exposure. For this 
reason, in future studi eswith adavosertib m onotherapy  a starting dose of 250 m gQD will be 
used (for further details refer to Investigator’s Brochure ) . In the ADAGIO study  no further 
patients will  be enrolled and there are no patients being treated at the 300mg QD dose level. 
4.4 End of Study Definition
A participant i s consi dered to have com pleted the study  if she has co mpleted all phases of the 
study  including the l astscheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Act ivities (SoA) 
(Secti on1.3)
.
The end o f the study  is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study . 
The l ast vi sit occurs when the l ast parti cipant of Cohort B has their last scheduled visit, or  6 
months after last participant first dose in Cohort B , whic hever comes first.
After the primary analysis DCO, the clinical study  database will be closed to new data. The 
final  primary  analysis DCO will be followed by clinical database lock when all data for all 
participants have been co llected. 
The study  may be terminated at individual centres if the study  procedures are not being 
perform ed according to Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP), or if recruit ment is slow. AstraZeneca 
may also terminate the entire study  prem aturely if concerns for safet y arise wi thin this stud y 
or in any  other study  with adavosertib.
Parti cipants are permi tted to conti nue to receive adavosertib beyo nd primary  DCO in the 
continued access phase of this study  if, in the opinion of the invest igator, they are continuing 
to receive clinical benefit. Participants who continue to receive clinical benefit wit hout 
meet ing any discont inuation criteria at primary DCO may  cont inue to receive adavosertib (to 
be provided by  the Sponsor) if they are deriving clinical benefit in the opinion of the 
investigator a nd not fulfilling any discont inuat ion criteria.
Such participants are to be fo llowed in accordance wi th the Medical Standard of Care and as 
deem ed appropri ate by the investigators. Serious adverse event (SAE) reporting ( standard 
pharmacovigilance process ) will cont inue to ensure safet y data collection and monitoring of 
the participants while receiving the invest igational product. It is recommended that

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 45of 154investigators continue to observe ongo ing participants at the frequency emplo yed prior to the 
primary  DCO. Protocol  dose m odificat ion and stopping criteria are to be fo llowed while a 
participant is receiving adavosertib. Restrictions regarding concomitant medicat ions 
(Secti on6.5) must be fo llowed while the participant is receiving adavosertib. A  change in the 
dose/schedule o f adavosertib should only occur for safet y reasons, based on the invest igator ’s 
judgement, and should generally  follow the approach for dose reductio n and discont inuat ion 
as described in this protocol. Combining adavosertib wit h other anticancer therapy  is not 
allowed.
If in the opinio n of the invest igator , a participant is no longer receiving clinical benefit fro m 
the IP, then the IP will be stopped. The invest igator will inform AstraZeneca when a 
participant discont inues the IP . Parti cipants m ust return unused medicat ion during routine 
clinic visits; drug accountabilit y information must continue to be collected in patient source 
docum ents unt il the pa rticipant di scontinues treatment. Participants will cont inue to be 
monitored by  their treating physician/invest igator for all SAEs and pregnancies while 
receiving IPs and for 30 day s after the last dose of IP .
In the event that a roll -over study  is available at the time of the primary DCO and database 
closure, parti cipants(s) currently receiving treatment will adavosertib may  then be transi tioned 
to such a study , and the current study  woul d reach i ts end. The roll -over or extensi on study  
woul d ensure treatm ent continuat ion with visit assessments per i ts protocol , as applicable. Any 
participants who would be eligible to move to such a study  woul d be given a new informed 
consent, as applicable.
5 STUDY POPULATION

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 55of 154Table7 Prohibited Concomitant Medications
Prohibited Medication/Class of Drug Additional Information
Anticancer agents other than the study medications: 
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal 
anticancer therapy, radiotherapy (except for 
palliative local radiotherapy), biological therapy or 
other novel agent.If such agents are required for a participant, then the 
participant must first be withdraw n from the study.  
Concomitant treatment with aprepitant and 
fosap repitant is not allowable per protocol until 
further evaluation.An exploratory assessment of the effect of aprepitant on 
adavosertib exposure in oncology participants suggests that 
there is a drug interaction between adavosertib and 
aprepitant, as exposur e to adavosertib increased by ~60% 
when aprepitant was co -administered with adavosertib. The 
observed increase in adavosertib exposure is likely the 
result of CYP3A4 inhibition by aprepitant. This increase in 
exposure is statistically significant. At the s elected MTDs, 
this increase may also be of clinical importance.  
Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed 
throughout the study.  These herbal medications 
include, but are not limited to: St. John’s wort, 
kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, 
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw 
palmetto, and ginseng.  Participants should stop using these herbal medications 7 
days prior to first dose of adavosertib.
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors 
and moderate CYP3A inhibitors.See Appendix D
Grapefruit, Seville oranges and their products 
(eg,juice, marmalade, etc.)As grapefruit and Seville oranges are moderate inhibitors 
of CYP3A4, these fruits or their products should be 
avoided while taking adavosertib.  
Receipt of live virus and live bacterial vaccines is 
not permitted while the participant is receiving

Table8 Restricted Concomitant Medications
Restricted Medication/Class of Drug Usage
Inhibitors or substrates of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) In vitro studies have shown that adavosertib may be a 
substrate and inhibitor for human P-gp. Caution should be 
exercised when agents that are inhibitors or substrates of 
P-gp are administered concomitantly with adavosertib (see 
Appendix D).
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 56of 154Restricted Medication/Class of Drug Usage
Substrates of Multidrug and Toxin Extruder 1 
(MATE1) and MATE2K transporters 
(eg,cimetidine, acyclovir, fexofenadine) Caution should be used when administering substrates of 
MATE1 and MATE2K transporters (eg, cimetidine, 
acyclovir, fexofenadine) as the clinical relevance of 
adavosertib inhibition of the MATE pathway is not known 
in these compounds.
Metformin Metformin should be used with caution. Adavosertib has 
been shown to be an inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2K 
transporters. A drug interaction with substrates of either 
transporter cannot be ruled out, the most important 
substrate known to date being metformin.
BCRP substrates with narrow therapeutic index Recent in vitro transporter studies have shown adavosertib 
to be an inhibitor of BCRP (IC 505.1 µM). This finding is 
particularly relevant for drugs administered orally where 
exposure is normally limited by BCRP -mediated efflux, in 
particular some statins, such as rosuvastatin. Other drugs 
where the disposition is mediated via BCRP should be 
administered with caution, dose modification considered or 
substituted by an alternative drug.

6.5.3 Palliative Radiotherapy
Parti cipants may  receive palliat ive radiotherapy during the study only for local pain control, 
and o nly if in the opinio n of the treating invest igator the participant does not have disease 
progression. If palliat ive radiotherapy is needed for disease progression, the patient should be 
taken off study  treatm ent.
6.5.4 Other Concomitant Treatment
Medicat ion othe r than those described above, which is considered necessary  for the 
participant’s safet y and wellbeing, may be given at the discretion of the invest igator and 
recorded in the appropriate sections o f the eCRF.
6.6 Dose Modification
Dose reductions or holds are allowed as clinically indicated by  the treating physician in line 
with Table9. Dose adj ustments will be based on the organ system exhibit ing the greatest 
degree of toxi city. For each parti cipant, a m aximum  of 2 successive dose reductions will be 
allowed during the study . Dose re -escalat ions are not allowed.

Parti cipants MUST be di scont inued fro m study  treatm ent in the fo llowing si tuations.
RECIST v1.1 -defined radio logical progressi on (refer to Secti on8.1.1 and Appendix A) 
Invest igator determinat ion that the participant is no longer benefit ing from study  
treatm ent
An AE that, in the opinion o f the invest igator or AstraZeneca, contraindicates further 
dosing
Any AE that meets criteria for discontinuation defined in the guidelines for management 
of treatm ent-related toxicit ies (see Sect ion8.3.13 )
Parti cipant decisi on. The parti cipant i s at any  time free to di scont inue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment. A participant who discontinues treatment is normally 
expected to continue to participate in the study  (eg, for safet y and survival f ollow-up) 
unless they  specifically wit hdraw their consent to all further participation in any study 
procedures and assessments (see Section 7.2).

Pregnancy or intent to beco me pregnant
Initiation of  subsequent ant icancer therapy, including another invest igational agent
Note that discontinuation fro m study  treatm ent is NOT th e same thing as a complete 
withdrawal  from the study . See the SoA (Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of 
treatm ent discont inuat ion (ie, Di scont inuat ion visi t) and foll ow-up and for any  further 
evaluat ions that need to be completed. If the reason for discont inuat ion is disease progression, 
then only the discont inuat ion visit is required. The 7 -day window ( +7 days) applies from the 
point a decisio n to di scont inue adavosertib is taken either due to progression or another 
discontinuat ion criterion. 
Parti cipants who have discontinued study  treatm ent pri or to objective RECIST v1.1 -defined 
radiological  progressi on will be followed up wi th tumour assessments a s indicated in the SoA  
(Secti on1.3) until RECIST v1.1-defined progressive disease or death, regardless of whether 
or not the participant started a subsequent anticancer therapy , unless they  have wi thdrawn all 
consent to study -related assessments.
After di scontinuat ion of study  medicat ion at any  point in the study , all ongoing AEs or SAEs 
must be fo llowed until reso lution unless, in the investigator ’s opinio n the condi tion is unlikely  
to resolve due to the participants underlying disease, or the participant is lost to fo llow-up (see 
Secti on7.3). All new AEs and SAEs occu rring during the follow -up peri od af ter the last dose 
of study  medicat ion must be reported (if SAEs, they  must be reported to AstraZeneca wit hin 
24 hours as described in Sect ion8.3.10 ) and follo wed to resolut ion as above. For guidance on 
reporting AEs after the fo llow-up peri od see Section 8.3.2 .
If the participant does not agree to continue in -person study  visits, a m odified foll ow-up 
shoul d be arranged, whenever possible, to ensure the collect ion of endpoints and safet y 
inform ation. This could be a telephone contact with the participant, a contact with a relat ive or 
treatin g physician, or informat ion from medical records. The approach taken should be 
recorded in the medical records. A participant that agrees to modified fo llow-up is not 
considered to have withdrawn consent or to have withdrawn from the study .
7.1.1 Procedure for Discontinuation of Study Intervention
The invest igator should instruct the participant to contact the site before or at the time if study 
treatm ent is stopped. A participant who decides to discontinue study treatment will always be 
asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. The date of last intake of study 
treatm ent shoul d be docum ented in the eCRF . All unused adavosert ib treatment should be 
returned by the participant at their next on -site study  visit or unscheduled visit. Participants 
perm anent ly discont inuing adavosertib treatment should be given locally available standard of 
care therapy  at the discretion o f the invest igator .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 59of 1547.1.2 Study Intervention Interruption
Treatment interruptions up to a maximum o f 21 days are permitted in the event of toxici ty (see 
adavosertib dose modificat ion gui delines [Secti on6.6]). The treatment interruption period 
shoul d be considered from  the onset of the toxicit y. In the event of a treatment interruption 
greater than 21 days, then the investigator will require approval fro m the sponsor to restart the 
participant on adavosertib treatment. 
7.2 Participant Withdrawal from the Study
A participant may withdraw fro m the study  at any  time at her own request or may be 
withdrawn at any  time at the di screti on of  the investi gator for safet y, behavioural, 
compliance, or administrative reasons .
A participant who considers wit hdrawing fro m the study  must be informed by  the 
investigator about modified fo llow-up opti ons (eg, telephone contact, a contact with a 
relative or treating physician, or information fro m medical records).
At the time of wit hdrawal  from the study , if possible, a discont inuat ion visit should be 
conducted, as shown in the SoA (Section 1.3).
The parti cipant will discont inue the study  interventio n and be wit hdrawn from the 
study  at that time.
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the sponsor may  
retain and cont inue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal o f consent.
If a partic ipant wi thdraws fro m the study , it shoul d be confirmed if she st ill agrees for 
exist ing samples to be used in line with the original consent. If she requests withdrawal of 
consent for use of samples, destruction of any samples taken and not tested should b e 
carried out in line with what was stated in the informed consent and local regulat ion. The 
investigator must document the decisio n on use of exist ing samples in the site study  
records and inform the Global Study  Team .
AstraZeneca or its delegate will request investi gators to collect informat ion on participants ’ 
vital status (dead or alive; date of death when applicable), including participants that withdrew 
consent or are classified as "lost to follow -up", from  publicly available sources, in accordance
with local regulat ions. Knowledge of the vital status at study  end in all participants is crucial 
for the integri ty of the study .
7.3 Lost to Follow -up
A participant will be considered lost to fo llow-up if she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be con tacted by  the study  site.
The fo llowing acti ons m ust be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study  visit:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 60of 154The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possi ble and counsel the participant on the importance o f maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study .
Before a participant is deemed lost to fo llow-up, the invest igator or d esignee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary , a certified l etter to the parti cipant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent m ethods). These contact attempts should be do cumented in the participant’s 
medical record.
Shoul d the participant continue to be unreachable, she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from  the study . 
Site personnel, or an independent third party , will  attem pt to collect the vital status of the 
participant within legal and ethical boundaries for all participants. Public sources may be 
searched for vital status informat ion. If vital status is determined as deceased, this will be 
docum ented, and the participant will not be considered lost to follow -up. S ponsor 
personnel will not be invo lved in any attempts to collect vital status information.

Study  procedures and their timing are summarised in the SoA (Section 1.3)
. Protocol
waivers or exempt ions are not allowed.
Immediate safet y concerns should be discussed wit h the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant shoul d continue or discontinue 
study  interventi on.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essent ial and required for study  conduct.
All screening evaluat ions must be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants m eet all eligibilit y criteria. The invest igator will maint ain a screening log to 
record details o f all participants screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilised for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the t ime frame defi ned in the SoA.
The am ount of  blood collected from  each participant over the duration of the study , 
including any  extra assessments that may be required, will be approximately  450 mL.

8.1 Efficacy Assessments
8.1.1 RECIST v1.1 Assessm ents
RECIST v1.1 tumour assessments will be performed using CT or MRI scans of the chest, 
abdo men and pelvis (wit h addit ional anatomy  as clinically  indicated by  extent of disease) at 
baseline (no m ore than 28 day s before the start of study  treatm ent). A dedicated pelvic MRI 
protocol  is recommended for optimal assessment. After start of treatment (Cy cle1, Day 1), 
scans will be repeated every  6 weeks (±7 days) for the first 48 weeks and every 9 weeks 
(±7days) thereafter, until object ive radio logical disease progressi on by  invest igator 
assessment using RECIST v1.1. If an unscheduled assessment is performed (eg, to invest igate 
clinical signs/symptoms of progression) and the participant has not progressed, every  attem pt 
shoul d be made to perform  the subsequent image acquisit ion at the next scheduled imaging 
visit. For ORR, a visit response of CR or PR must be confirmed by a subsequent scan 
conducted at least 4 weeks after the init ial respons e is observed. The next RECIST scheduled 
assessment can be used for the confirmatory  scan.  
Parti cipants who di scontinue treatm ent pri or to RECIST v1.1 progression (eg, discont inuat ion 
due to toxicit y or clinical  progressi on) shoul d continue to be scanned until RECIST v1.1 
progression. If the invest igator is in doubt as to whether radio logical progressi on has occurred, 
particularly wit h response on non -target lesio ns or the appearance of new lesio ns, it is 
advisable to continue treatment until the next sch eduled assessment (or sooner assessment, if 
clinically indicated) and reassess the participant ’s status. If repeat scans confirm progression, 
then the date of the init ial scan should be declared as the date of progression.
The same imaging modalit y and the same assessment (eg, the same contrast protocol for CT 
scans of the chest and MRI scans of the pelvis) should be performed at baseline and at all 
follow-up time -points if possible. Guidelines on the valid methods of assessment and the 
evaluat ion of object ive tumour response using RECIST v1.1 are provided in Appendix A.
Efficacy assessments of confirmed ORR, DoR, percentage change from baseline in tumour 
size, PFS, and DCR will also be derived (by AstraZeneca) using RECIST v1.1 assessments 
based on BICR. All images, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing 
basis and sent to an AstraZeneca -appo inted Contract Research Organisat ion (CRO) to enable 
BICR up to the primary analysis DCO (when the last participant has their last scheduled visit, 
or 6months after last participant first dose, whichever is earlier). After the primary analysis 
DCO, images will no longer need to be collected centrally . Ongoing collect ion of 
site-reviewed tum our assessment is required and must be recorded in the eCRF . Radi ological 
examinat ions performed in the conduct of this s tudy should be retained at site as source data.

Independent Review Charter ( also referred to as “Imaging Charter ”). Results of the 
independent reviews will not be communicated to investigators, and results of invest igator 
RECIST v1.1 assessments will not be shared with the central reviewers. The management of 
participants will be based who lly upon the results of the RECIST v1.1 assessment conducted 
by the investigator .

Secti on9.4.1.7 , respectively .
8.1.2 Survival Follow -up
Assessments for survival will be conducted every  12 weeks from  the time of object ive disease 
progression or treatment discontinuation. Survival informat ion may be obtained via telephone 
contact wi th the parti cipant, parti cipant ’s family , by contact wi th the parti cipant ’s current 
physician, or local death registries as described in Section 7.3.
For informat ion on OS, refer to Section 9.4.1.6 .
8.1.2.1 Subsequent Cancer Therapy Following Discontinuation of Study 
Intervention 
Details o f subsequent cancer therapy  following di scontinuat ion of adavosertib will be 
collected as part of the post -treatm ent follow-up visi t, and at the survival follow -up visi t. The 
choice o f subsequent systemic ant icancer treatm ent will be entirely at the discret ion of  the 
investigator .

8.2.3 Electroc ardiograms
ECG will be performed at timelines as specified in the SoA  (Secti on1.3). A 12-lead safet y 
ECG (paper ECG printout of 10 seconds for investigator review) will be taken at screening, 
and if a prolongat ion of the QT c interval is detected this must be closely mo nitored as 
clinically indicated, and to the best of clinical practice. 
The parti cipants will rest for at least 10 minutes before the start of the ECG recording and they 
must be in the same supine body  posi tion (m aximum  30degrees flexio n in the hip and feet not 
in contact wi th the f ootboard) at the recording t ime point.
If one ECG demonstrates a QT cF > 480 m sec, then a m ean QT cF of ≤480 m sec obtained from 
3 ECGs 2 -
5 minutes apart, is required for the patient to be eligible for study entry .
The invest igator will judge the overall interpretation as normal or abnormal. If abnor mal, it 
will be decided as to whether or not the abnormalit y is clinically significant or n ot clinically  
significant. The paper copy  of each ECG reading will be retained with the participant’ s 
completed source docum ents. Any clinically significant abnormal ities detected require 
triplicate ECG results. At each time point at which triplicate ECG are required, 3 individual 
ECG tracings should be obtained in successio n, within 5 minutes. If there is a clinically 
significant abnorm al unscheduled ECG finding duri ng the treatm ent peri od, thi s shoul d be 
recorded on the AE eCRF , according to standard AE collect ion and reporting processes (see 
Secti on8.3). 
Attention shoul d be paid to any  detected i ncreases in QT c interval. Participants who develop a 
single rest ing value of QT c interval o f >480 m sec or a shift from baseline o f ≥ 60 ms, should 
pause taking adavosertib. Dosing may be resumed at the same or reduced dose after retur n of 
the resting QTc interval to Grade 1 or baseline has been confirmed and correction of possible 
electroly te imbalance has been made, if needed, following cardiologists ’s advice. For m ore 
details, see Sect ion8.3.13.2 and Table15.
Moni toring of QT c, checking and correction of abnormal electrolyte levels and renal function 
are advised, especially in case of severe/pro longed diarrhoea. If QT c increases markedly fro m 
baseline but stays below the above limit of Grade 1 (per CTCAE v5.0), a cardiologist ’s advice 
is reco mmended.
The concomitant use of ondansetron (known to prolo ng the QT c interval in rare cases, per 
labelling) should be taken into account when interpreting QT cchanges.

Addit ional safet y samples may  be collected if clinically indicated at any  time during the cy cle 
at the discretion of the invest igator . The date, time of collect ion and results (values, units and 
reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF .
The clinical chemistry , haematol ogy, urinalysis and pregnancy  test will  be perf ormed at a l ocal 
laboratory  at or near to the investigator site. Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary  
depending on lab oratory  method used and routine practice at the site. 
Com plete haematol ogy blood counts and clinical chemistry  will be obtained for all 
participants at visits on Day  1, Day 5, Day  8, Day  12 and Day  15 in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and 
at the beginning of each t reatm ent week (on Day  1 and Day  8) in Cycle 3 onwards. Creatinine 
clearance (CrCl ) must be estimated using the Cockcroft -Gault equation at all visit s. On dosing 
days, the results must be reviewed prior to dose administration to ensure that they  meet the 
dosing thresho lds. For management of adavosertib -related toxicit y management, refer to 
Secti on 8.3.13.
Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test during 
screening and a confirmatory  negative test prior to dosing on D ay 1 of each treatm ent cy cle. In 
the event of suspected pregnancy  during the study , the test shoul d be repeated prior to dosing 
and, if posit ive, the participant discont inued from study treatment immediately .
The l aboratory  variables presented in Table10will be measured as a minimum (so me of these 
variables may be measured at baseline only) . 
The invest igator should make an assessment of the available results with rega rd to clinically 
relevant abnorm alities. Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory  values shoul d be 
repeated as clinically indicated and recorded on the eCRF . The laboratory  resul ts shoul d be 
signed and dated and retained at centre as source data for laboratory  variables. For inform ation 
on how AEs based on laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 8.3.

8.3.3 Causality Collection
The invest igator should assess causal relationship between Invest igational Product and each 
AE, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the questi on 
‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable 
possibilit y that the event may  have been caused by the investigational product? ’
For SAEs, causal relat ionship should also be assessed for other medic ation and study  
procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study  procedure the causal 
relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y question is found in Appendix E.
8.3.4 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question 
from the study  site staff (eg, ‘Have y ou had any heal th probl ems since the previous visit/y ou 
were l ast asked?) or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF . 
When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately
.
They  do not include metastases of the original cancer.
8.3.5 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests
The results from the CSP mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the 
clinical study  report (CSR). 
Deteri oration as com pared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  values, vital signs and 
ECG abnormalit ies shoul d therefore only  be reported as AEs if they  fulfil any  of the SAE 
criteria, are the reason for discont inuat ion of treatment with the invest igational product or are 
considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the invest igator (which may include but i s not

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 72of 154limited to considerat ion as to whether treatment or non- planned visits were required or other 
action was taken wit h the study  treatm ent, eg, dose adj ustment or drug interruption).
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion. Wherever possible the reporting invest igator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglo bin value). 
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, which is unequivocally due to di sease progressi on, shoul d 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related t o the disease under study  (see Secti on8.3.7 ).
8.3.6 Hy’s Law
Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry  may requi re further 
evaluat ion and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN 
will need to be reported as SAEs if criteria are met for a Potential Hy ’s Law case. Pl ease refer 
to Appendix Hfor further instructi on on cases of increases in liver biochemistry  and 
evaluat ion of Hy ’s Law .
8.3.7 Disease Progression
Disease progressi on can be considered as a worsening of a participant ’s condi tion attri butable 
to the disease for which the invest igational product is being studied. It may be an increase in 
the severit y of the di sease under study  and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The 
development of new or progression of exist ing metastasis to the primary ca ncer under study  
shoul d be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events, which are unequivocally 
due to disease progressi on, shoul d not be reported as an AE during the study .
8.3.8 New Cancers
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an A E and will generally  meet at l east 
one of the serious criteria. New cancers are those that are not the primary  reason for the 
administration of the study  treatm ent and have been identified after the participant ’s inclusio n 
in this study . They do not includ e metastases of the ori ginal  cancer .
8.3.9 Handling of Deaths
All deaths that occur during the study , or wi thin the 30 -day follow-up period after the 
administration of the last dose of study  treatm ent must be reported as fo llows:
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73of 154Death, which is unequivocally du e to di sease progressio n, should be co mmu nicated to the 
study  monitor at the next m onitoring visit and should be documented in the eCRF 
module, but shoul d not be reported as a SAE during the study .
Where death is not clearly  due to disease progression of t he disease under study  the AE 
causing the death should be reported by  entering into the web -based data capture 
(WBDC) system as an SAE within 24 hours. The report should contain a comment 
regarding the co -involvement of progression of disease, if appropria te, and shoul d assign 
a single primary  cause of  death together with any  contri butory  causes.
Death wi th an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE but every  effort shoul d 
be made to establish a cause of death. A post- mortem may be helpful  in the assessment of 
the cause of death, and if performed a copy  of the post -mortem results (wit h translat ion of 
important parts into English) should be reported in an expedited fashio n to an 
AstraZeneca representative wit hin the usual t imefr ames. 
8.3.10 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally relate d to the invest igational 
product, or to the study  procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF .
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study , then investi gators or other si te personnel inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one da y ie, immediately but no later  than 
24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all the 
necessary  informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site within 
1calendar  day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately . invest igators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca 
representatives of any  follow-up inform ation on a previously reported SAE within one 
calendar day  ie, immediately but no later  than 24 hours of when he or she becom es aware of
it.
Once the invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is seri ous in the electroni c data 
capture (EDC) sy stem , an autom ated em ail alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca 
representative.
If the EDC system is not available, then the investiga tor or other study  site staf f reports a SAE 
using paper form to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by email or fax.
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/study site staff how to proceed.

8.3.11 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca.
If a participant beco mes pregnant during the course of the study , treatm ent shoul d be 
disconti nued immediately .
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicio n that the study  treatm ent 
under invest igation may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. 
Congenital abnormalit ies/birth defects and spont aneous miscarriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complicat ions should not be handled as AEs. The 
outcom e of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy , 
norm al birth or congeni tal abnorm ality) shoul d be fo llowed up and documented even if the 
participant was discont inued fro m the study .
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study , then the investigator or other study  centre 
personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca represe ntatives within 1 day , ie, immediately 
but no later  than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Pati ent Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 
5calendar days for SAEs (see Section 8.3.10 ) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcom e inform ation is available.
The PREGREP module in the eCRF is used to report.
8.3.12 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study , a m edicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for the study  drug that ei ther causes ha rm to the parti cipant or has the 
potenti al to cause harm  to the parti cipant.
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error has:
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were identified that could have led to an error
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 75of 154Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name confusio n
Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the participant
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet
Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature
Wrong participant received the medicat ion
Wrong drug administered to p articipant
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose see Section 8.4)
Parti cipant failed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in
open l abel studi es, even if an AstraZeneca product
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error .
If a medicat ion error occurs in the course of the study , then the invest igator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day  ie, immediately  
but no l ater than 24 hours of wh en he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is completed wi thin 1 (Init ial Fatal /Life -Threatening or follow -up 
Fatal /Life -Threatening) or 5 (other serious i nitial and fo llow-up) cal endar days if there is an 
SAE associated with the medicat ion error (see Sectio n 8.3.1 ) and within 30 days for all other 
medicat ion errors.

8.3.13 Management of Adavosertib -
related Toxicities
Please refer to Section 6.6for guidance on the dose levels to be used for dose modifications. 
Treatment with adavosertib should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of 
grade or for any AEs grade ≥3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 76of 154the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be 
specifically associated with adavosertib. Appropriate and optimal supportive treatment of the 
toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications. The Medical Monitor may be 
consulted prior to dose reduction or discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.
8.3.13.1 Haematologic Toxicity Dose Modifications
Com plete bl ood counts ( CBC) will be obtained for all part icipants at Day  1, Day  5, Day  8, 
Day 12and Day 15 in the first 2 cy cles, and at the beginning of each treatment week (on Day  
1 and Day  8) in Cycle 3 onwards . The CBC results must be reviewed prior to dose 
administration . If haematologic toxicit y occurs, treatment should be held, and ANC and 
platelets shoul d be m onitored at l east weekly . Partici pants shoul d be managed as medically 
indicated in Table11, Table12and Table13below.
No m ore than two dose reductions will be allowed for any participant. Participants requiring 
further dose reduction due to haematologic toxicit y must discont inue study  treatm ent. Dose re -
escalat ion is not allowed. If the participant has concurrent neutropenia and thrombocy topeni a, 
the most conservat ive guidance in the table below should be followed and discussed with 
Medical Monitor as needed.
Treatment should not be resumed unt il the haematological toxicit y is reso lved (or severit y 
reduced to Grade ≤1 for platelet count and to Grade ≤ 2for neutrophil count).
If haematological parameter s do not recover within 21 days, the participant should be 
removed from  study  treatm ent [see Section 7.1.2].

standard procedures, with interruption of study  treatm ent, th e urgent init iation o f intravenous 
(IV) antibiotic therapy , and use of granulocy te colony -stimulat ing factor (G -CSF) according to 
institutional standards.
Antibiotics and G -CSF are recommended in cases of severe neutropenia, to be administered 
for 3 days o r until the neutrophil count improves to ≤ Grade 2. G -CSF administration should 
commence 24 –48 hours after last dose of adavosertib.

For participants experiencing severe neutropenia in a preceding cycle, secondary prophylaxis 
with (non -pegylated) G -CSF daily for 3 days commencing 24 – 48 hours after last dose of 
adavosertib in a treatment cycle is recommended. Secondary  prophylaxis is to be administered 
in addition to any  requi red dose reducti on.
Please note that G -CSF is not recommended within 24 hours of the last dose of study 
treatm ent. Non -pegylated G -CSF should be stopped at least 48 hours before restarting study  
drug, and pegylate d G-CSF shoul d be stopped 14 days before restarting study  drug.
Renal funct ion (measured by  creatinine clearance) should be monitored and dose 
modificati ons to m anage renal impairment fo llowed (Secti on 8.3.13. 3.) as adavosertib 
exposure and the risk of severe neutropenia might be increased in participants with low

found between ΔQTcF and adavosertib concentration. Model prediction of change in QTcF at the geometric 
mean of C maxon Day  1 (712.8 nM) was 2.405 msec (90% CI: 5.939, 1.129). Similarly, model prediction of

8.3.13.4 Gastrointestinal Toxicity Management Guidelines
As per the SoA  (Secti on1.3), each parti cipant will be contacted for a general assessment on 
Day 3 (±1 day ) of Cycle 1 and 2 to assess for AEs potenti ally related to adavosertib. In the 
event of significant diarrhoea, nausea and/or vomit ing, or reduced oral intake, it is strongly 
recommended that the participant is considered for IV fluid rehydration therapy and 
supportive care measures.
For pa rticipants  experiencing gastrointestinal toxicit ies or  who are otherwise at risk of 
dehydrat ion, creatinine clearance should be closely monitored and dose modificat ions to 
manage renal impairment fo llowed (see previous section).   
Diarrhoea
Due to frequ ent reports of di arrhoea wi th adavosertib administration, ant i-diarrhoeal  treatm ent 
with loperamide (Im odium ) is requi red at the first onset of diarrhoea according to Amer ican 
Society of Clinical  Oncol ogy (ASCO) gui delines. Oral  loperamide 4 mg should be 
administered at the first onset of diarrhoea and then 2 mg every 2 hours unt il part icipant is 
diarrhoea -free for at least 12 hours. The first dose of loperamide could be lowered to 2 mg if 
the diarrhoea is recurrent and if, in the opinion o f the treating physician, the diarrhoea is not 
severe.

A comprehensive statist ical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and it will include a more 
technical and detailed description o f the stati stical analyses described in this sect ion. This 
section is a summary o f the planned stati stical analyses of the most important endpoints 
including primary  and key  secondary endpoints. A Continuous Monitoring Plan (CMP) wil l 
also be produced to describe the approach, decisio n criteria, statist ical analyses and 
communicat ion plan for continuous monitoring in this study .
Descript ive statistics will be used for all variables. Continuous variables will be summarised 
by the numbe r of observat ions, m ean, standard deviat ion, median, minimum and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be summarised by frequency counts and percentages for each 
category . Unless otherwise stated, percentages will be calculated out of the populat ion total .
Additional subgroup analyses of efficacy  and safety  may be perform ed and will be specified 
in the SAP .
9.4.1 Efficacy 
All efficacy analyses will be performed separately on the F AS and the CCAS .
9.4.1.1 Primary Endpoint: ORR
ORR is derived using the BICR data to define a confi rmed response of CR or PR, with the 
deno minator defined as a subset of all treated participants with measurable disease at baseline 
per BICR. ORR will also be defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed 
investigator -assessed response o f CR or PR and will based on a subset of all treated 
participants wi th measurable disease at baseline per the site invest igator .
A confi rmed response of CR/PR means that a response of CR/PR is recorded at 1 visit and 
confirmed by repeat imaging not less th an 4 weeks after the visit when the response was first 
observed wit h no evidence o f progression between the init ial and CR/PR confirmat ion visit. 
Summaries of ORR for the primary  analysis will be based on BICR. 
ORR and its 90% and 95% CI (Clopper -Pearson) will be summarised .ORR per investigator 
review will be a sensit ivity analysis.
The primary  analysis will be performed, in both the F AS and centrally confirmed USC 
popul ations, 6 months after the last patient first dose, or when all have progressed or died due 
to any  cause, whichever i s earlier .Maturi ty of DoR data will also be taken into account when 
select ing the DCO date for primary analysis. No further analyses will be performed bey ond the 
primary  analysis.
An interim analysis is planned after appr oximately 30 participants in the CCAS in Cohort A

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 93of 154have had the opportunity  to be treated for at l east 4 m onths. Recrui tment will not be paused 
whilst the participants required for the interim are evaluated. It may  be considered fut ile to 
continue recruit ment into the study  if there is  probabilit y for the ORR to be greater 
than  This translates into observing or fewer responders out of 30 participants; an 
ORR of  which has a 2- sided exact bino mial 80% CI of  to  wherein the 
upper confidence limit is below  The analysis will be performed on participants who had 
the opportunit y to be treated for at least 4 months. A sensi tivity analysis will be performed on 
all participants who had the opportunit y to be treated for at least 4 mo nths, and those with a 
best overall response of CR, PR, and progressive disease. 
9.4.1.2 Secondary Endpoint: DoR
DoR will be defined as the time fro m the date of first documented response (which is 
subsequent ly confirmed) unt il date of documented progression or d eath in the absence of 
disease progressi on (ie, date of PFS event or censoring –date of first response + 1). The end 
of response shoul d coincide wi th the date of progressio n or death fro m any cause used for the 
PFS endpo int. The time of the init ial respon se will  be defined as the l atest of the dates 
contributing towards the first visit that was CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed.
If a participant does not progress fo llowing a response, then their DoR will use the PFS 
censoring t ime.
If there are suff icient numbers of responders, and sufficient numbers of responses that have 
progressed by the point of the analysis, Kaplan -Meier pl ots of  DoR in the responding 
participants will be produced, and appropriate descriptive summary statist ics will be presented
by starti ng dose (n, number of responses that have progressed, median, quartile, minimum and 
maximum DoR).
Summaries of DoR will be based on BICR; DoR per invest igator review will be a sensit ivity 
analysis.
A separate analysis will be performed using thos e confirmed responders that have been 
followed for a minimum of 6 months after response and using all confirmed responders 
regardl ess of fo llow-up time.
9.4.1.3 Secondary Endpoint: Depth of Response
Absolute change and percentage change fro m baseline will be based on RECIST v1.1 T arget 
Lesio ns (TLs) measurements. Tumour size is the sum of the longest diameters of the TLs. 
Baseline for RECIST v1.1 is defined as the last evaluable assessment prior to the start of 
treatm ent. Percent changes in tumour size from baselin e will  be determined for parti cipants 
with measurable disease at baseline and is derived at each visit as the % change in the sum of 
the diameters of TLs. % change = [(post baseline TL  sum  –baseline TL  sum) / baseline TL  
sum] *100. Handling of missing dat a will be described in the SAP . Depth of response will be

9.4.1.4 Secondary Endpoint: PFS
PFS i s defined as the time from first dose until the date of object ive disease progress ion or 
death (by  any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the participant 
withdraws fro m study  drug or receives another anticancer therapy  prior to progressi on 
(ie,date of PFS event or censoring –date of first dose + 1). Participant s who have not 
progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of 
assessment fro m their last evaluable RECIST v1.1 assessment. However, if the part icipant 
progresses or dies after two or more missed visit s, the pa rticipant will  be censored at the time 
of the l atest eval uable RECIST v1.1 assessment prior to the two missed visits.
Summaries of PFS (n, events, medians, quartiles, proportion progression free at 3, 6, 9 and 
12months and corresponding 95% CIs) and Kapla n-Meier pl ots will be provi dedby starting 
dose.
Summaries of PFS will be based on BICR; PFS per investigator review will be a sensit ivity 
analysis.
9.4.1.5 Secondary Endpoint: PFS6
The PFS6 will be defined as the Kaplan -Meier estimate of PFS (per RECIST v1.1) at 6 
months.
Summaries of PFS6 will be based on BICR; PFS6 per invest igator review will be a sensit ivity 
analysis.
9.4.1.6 Secondary Endpoint: OS
Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose until death due to any  cause 
regardl ess of whether the participant withdraws from rando mised therapy  or receives another 
anticancer therapy  (ie, date of death or censoring –date of first dose + 1). Any participant not 
known to have died at the time o f analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on 
which the participant was known to be alive (SUR_DA T, recorded within the SUR VIVE 
module of the eCRF). 
Note: Survival calls will be made in the week fo llowing the date of DCO for the analysis, and 
if part icipants are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is post the DCO date these 
participants will be censored at the date of DCO. The status of ongoing, withdrawn (from the

obtained by  the si te personnel  by checking the participant ’s notes, hospital records, contacting 
the participant ’s general practit ioner and checking publicly -available de ath regi stries. In the 
event that the participant has actively wit hdrawn consent to the processing of their personal 
data, the vital status of the participant can be obtained by site personnel fro m publicly 
available resources where it is possible to do so under applicable local laws.
Summaries of OS (n, events, medians, quartiles, proportion alive at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and 
corresponding 95% CIs) and a Kaplan
-Meier pl ot will  be provi dedby starting dose .
9.4.1.7 Secondary Endpoint: DCR
Disease control  rate is de fined as the proportion of participants with best response of 
confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or who have stable disease at least 5 weeks after first dose (to 
allow for an early assessment within the assessment window).
DCR and its 95% CI (Clopper -Pearson) wil l be summarised .Summaries of DCR will be based 
on BICR; DCR per investigator review will be a sensit ivity analysis.
9.4.1.8 Secondary Endpoint: PK
Pharmacokinet ic concentration data and summary statist ics will be tabulated. Pharmacokinet ic 
param eters will  be dete rmined from the raw data. The fo llowing PK parameters will be 
determined after the first and steady -state doses: C maxand C trough (as data allows).

Solid Tumours)
Introduction
This appendix details the implementation o f Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tumours 
versio n 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) guidelines (Eisenhau er et al  2009) for this study  with regard to 
investigator assessment of tumour burden including protocol- specific requirements for this 
study . The differences from the published RECIST v1.1 guidelines are the exclusio n of 
clinical examinat ion and ultrasoun d as valid m odali ties to eval uate T arget Lesions (TL), 
Non-Target Lesions (NTL) or new lesio ns; and a clarification o f the use of 18FDG -PET to 
ident ify new lesio ns. 
Definitions of measurable, non -measurable, target and non -target lesions
Measurable:
A tumour lesi on that can be accurately  measured at baseline as ≥10 mm  in the l ongest 
diameter for non -nodal  lesions or ≥15 mm in short axis diameter1for lymph node lesio ns 
with com puted tom ography  (CT) or m agnet ic resonance imaging (MRI) and that is 
suitable for accurate repeated m easurements.
Non-measurable:
All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 mm to <15 mm short axis diameter at baseline2).
Truly non -measurable lesio ns include the followin g: bone l esions, l eptom eningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusio n and abdominal masses/abdo minal

Special cases:
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic–blast ic lesio ns, with ident ifiable so ft tissue com ponents, 
can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definit ion of 
measurabilit y. Blast ic lesio ns are considered non -measurable.
Cystic met astases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for 
measurabilit y from a radi ological  point of view, but if non -cystic lesions are present in 
the sam e pat ient, these should be selected over cy stic lesi ons as TLs.
Target Lesions (TLs):
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns (with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ), representative 
of all lesio ns involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TLs 
at baseline. Lymph nodes, in any locat ion (local/regional and distant), are collect ively 
considered as a single organ, with a maximum o f 2 lymph nodes as TLs. A bilateral organ (eg, 
adrenal glands), a segmented organ (eg, liver), or a mult ilobed organ (eg, lung) is each 
considered as a single organ.
Tumour lesi ons selected for fresh screening biopsy should not be selected as TLs, unless 
imaging occurred at least ~2 weeks after biopsy, allowing time for healing.
Non-Target Lesions (NTLs):
Addit ional measurable lesio ns not recorded as TLs and non -measurable lesio ns (o r sites of 
disease) shoul d be i dentified as NTLs at baseline.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 101of 154CT and MRI 
CT and MRI, each preferably with IV contrast, are generally considered to generate the best 
currently available and reproducible anatomical images for measurement of TL, assessment of 
NTL, and i dentification o f any New Lesio ns. 
It is recommended that IV  contrast-enhanced CT or MRI examinat ions of the chest, abdomen 
and pelvis will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and fo llow-up visi ts. Any other 
areas of disease involvement (eg, brain) should be addit ionally  imaged based on the si gns and 
symptoms of individual participants . In participants who are sensit ive to intravenous CT 
contrast, a non -contrast CT examinat ion of the chest and an MRI with intravenous MRI 
contrast of the abdo men is appropriate. In participants with severely  com promised renal 
function a non -contrast CT examinat ion of the chest and abdo men is appropriate. For brain 
lesion assessment, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method over IV  contrast -enhanced 
CT. It is strongly  recommended to maintain use of the same imaging modalit y (CT or MRI), 
acquisit ion protocol , facility and scanner across all imaging t ime points per patient.
Clinical examination 
Clinical examinat ion of skin/surface lesio ns (by  visual  inspect ion or manual palpat ion) will 
not be used for RECIST assessments. Tumours ident ified by clinical examinat ion will need to 
be assessed by  correl ative CT or MRI anatomical scans.
Chest X -ray
Chest X -ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL. Chest X -ray can, however, be 
used to assess NTL and to ident ify the presence o f new lesio ns.
Plain X- ray 
Plain X- ray may be used as a method of assessment for bone NTL and to identify the presence 
of new bone lesio ns. 
Ultrasound 
Ultrasound examinat ion will not be used for RECIST assessment of tumours as it is not a 
reproducible a cquisit ion method (operator dependent), is subject ive in int erpretati on and m ay 
not provi de an accurate assessment of true tumour size. Tumours ident ified by ultrasound will 
need to be assessed by  correl ative CT or MRI anatomical scan.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 102of 154Endoscopy and laparoscopy 
Endoscopy  and l aparoscopy  will not be used for tumour assessments as they  are not validated 
in the context of tumour assessment.
Histology and cytology
Histology on tum our bi opsy  samples will not be used as part of the tumour response 
assessment as per RECIST v1.1. 
Results of cyto logical examinat ion for the neoplastic origin o f any effusi on (eg, asci tes,
pericardial  effusi on, pleural  effusi on) that appears or worsens during the study  will not be 
used as part of the tumour response assessment in this study. An effusio n that appears or 
significant ly worsens (fro m trace to large) radio logically by  CT/MRI ana tomical scans will be 
considered to be disease progression due to New Lesio ns or progression of NTLs, 
respectively .
Isotopic bone scan 
Bone l esions i dentified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by CT , MRI, or 
X-ray at baseline should be re corded as NTL  and followed by the same method as per baseline 
assessment. 
Isotopi c bone scans m ay be used as a method of assessment to ident ify the presence of new 
bone lesio ns at follow -up visi ts. New l esions m ay be recorded in case posit ive hot-spots 
appear on a bone scan that were not present on a previous bone scan; however, a newly 
observed equivocal hot -spot on a bone scan which cannot be verified with correlative imaging 
(CT, MRI, X -ray) of the sam e anatomical region shall not be the only  trigger fo r a PD 
assessment at that timepoint.

evidence of ne w lesions on CT/MRI scans then fo llow-up CT/MRI assessments should be 
continued, scheduled as per protocol or as clinically indicated, in order to confirm new 
lesions.
Tumour response evaluation
Schedule of evaluation
Baseline assessments should enco mpass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the 
disease under evaluation and should addit ionally investigate areas that may  be involved based 
on si gns and symptom s of individual participants and should be performed wit hin the 28 days 
prior to Day  1 of Cycle 1 of study  treatm ent and i deally as close as possible to the start of 
study  treatm ent. F ollow -up assessments will be performed at the times specified in the SoA 
(see Section 1.3).
If an unscheduled assessment is performed, and the patient has not progressed, every attempt 
shoul d be made to perform  the subsequent assessments at their scheduled imagin g visi ts.
Target lesions
Documentation of target lesions
A maximum o f 5 measurable lesio ns, wi th a maximum  of 2 lesions per organ (including 
lymph nodes collect ively considered as a single organ), representative of all lesio ns involved 
shoul d be i dentified as TL  at baseline. T arget lesio ns should be selected on the basis of their 
size (l ongest di ameter for non -nodal  lesions or short axis diameter for nodal lesio ns), but in 
addition shoul d be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may 
be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesio n does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesio n, which can be measured 
reproducibly , shoul d be selected.
The site and locat ion of each TL  shoul d be docu mented as well as the longest diameter for 
non-nodal  lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded in 
millimetres. At baseline the sum o f the diameters for all TL  will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum of diamete rs. At follow -up visi ts the sum of diameters for all TL  will be 
                                               
4A positive FDG -PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake ( eg, standardised uptake value) 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue or liver is observed.

Special cases
For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter. For 
pathol ogical lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis 
diameter. 
If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is >5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at 
baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan.
If a lesio n has co mpletely disappeared, the diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. If a 
lesion appears in the same location on a subsequent scan, it will be recorded as a New 
Lesio n.
If a TL split s into two or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. 
If 2 or more TLs merge, t hen the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be 
recorded for one of the lesio ns and 0 mm recorded for the other lesio n(s). 
If a TL i s believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too sm all to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assi gned. If an accurate measure can be given, this should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an est imate of the 
size of the lesio n. 
When a TL has had any intervent ion eg, definit iveradiotherapy , embo lisation, surgery , 
etc. during the study , the si ze of  the TL shoul d still be provided where possible and the 
intervent ion recorded in the RECIST case report form. If a TL has been co mpletely 
removed (surgery ), the l ongest di ameter shoul dbe recorded as 0 mm.
Evaluation of target lesions
This sect ion provi des the definit ions of the criteria used to determine object ive tumour visit 
response for TL ( Table 22).
Table22 RECIST v1.1 Evaluation of T arget Lesions
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all TLs since baseline.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
selected as TLs must have a reduction in short axis diameter to <10 mm.
Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking as 
reference the baseline sum of diameters
Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient decrease in sum of diameters to q ualify  for PR no r 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 105of 154Progression of disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as 
reference the smallest previous sum of diameters (nadir) –this includes 
the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm from nadir
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the TLs at follow -up were not assessed or not 
evaluable (eg, missing anatomy) or had a lesion intervention at this 
visit.  NOTE: if the sum of diameters meets the progressive disease 
criteria, progressive disease overrides not evaluable as a TL response
Not applicable (NA) Only relevant if no TLs present at baseline
TL,target lesion.
Non-target lesions
Evaluation of non -target lesions
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL  shoul d be i dentified as NTL  at 
baseline. Measurements are not required for these lesio ns, but their status should be fo llowed
at subsequent visits. At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL  response shoul d be 
recorded by  the invest igator . This sect ion provi des the definit ions of the criteria used to 
determine and record overall response for NTL  at the invest igational site a t each visit
(Table 23).
Table23 RECIST v1.1 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all NTLs since baseline.  All lymph nodes must be 
non
-pathological in s ize (<10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more NTL
Progression (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing NTLs. U nequivocal pro gression 
may be due to an important progression in one lesion only or in several 
lesions.  In all cases the progr ession MUST be clinically significant for 
the phy sician to consider changing (or stopping) therapy
Not evaluable (NE) Only relevant when one or some of the NTLs were not assessed and, in 
the investigator’s opinion, they are not able to provide an eva luable 
overall NTL assessment at this visit
NOTE: for participants without TLs at baseline, this is relevant if any of 
the NTLs were not assessed at this visit and the progression criteria have 
not been met
Not applicable (NA) Only relevant if no NTLs pr esent at baseline
NTL, non-target lesion; TL, target lesion.
To achieve ‘unequivocal  progressi on’ on the basis of NTLs, there must be an overall level o f 
substant ial worsening in non -target di sease such that, even in presence of stable disease or 
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 106of 154partialresponse in TLs, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion of therapy . A modest ‘increase ’ in the size o f one or m ore NTLs is usually not 
sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progressio n status.
New lesions
Details o f any new lesio ns will also be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of 
one or m ore new l esions is assessed as progression. The finding of a new lesio n shoul d be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in i maging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumour . If a new l esion is 
equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour assessments should 
be cont inued unt il the previously new lesio n has been assessed as unequivocal and then the 
progression date should be declared using the date of the init ial scan when the new lesio n first 
appeared.
A lesio n ident ified at a fo llow-up assessment in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a ne w lesi on and will indicate di sease progressi on.
Symptomatic deterioration
Symptom atic (clinical) deterioration is not a descriptor of an object ive response: it is a reason 
for stopping study  therapy .
Patients wi th ‘symptom atic deterioration ’ requi ring disc ontinuat ion of treatment without 
objective radio logic evidence of disease progression at that time should cont inue to undergo 
tumour assessments where clinically  feasible.

Study  treatm ent will be discont inued when disease progression per RECIST v1.1 is 
determined. In the rare instances when the RECIST v1.1-defined radio logical findings are 
considered equivocal by the invest igator or there is doubt whethe r or not there is evidence of 
objective progression (eg, technical issues including image artefacts), a follow -up scan will  be 
perform ed preferably at the next (and no later than the next) scheduled imaging visit, and no 
less than 4 weeks after the prior a ssessment of PD. If the repeat scan confirms progression, 
then study  treatm ent m ust be di scontinued, and the date of the init ial scan shoul d be declared 
as the date of PD. If the subsequent scan does not confirm the immediate prior radio logical 
PD, scannin g shoul d cont inue until the next RECIST v1.1-defined PD. 
Study  treatm ent may  be administered until radio logical PD i s confi rmed by  the subsequent 
scan, unless there is unacceptable toxicit y, withdrawal  of consent, or another discontinuation 
criterion is m et. Pati ents wi th rapid tum our progressi on or wi th symptom atic progression that 
requi res urgent medical intervent ion (eg, central nervous sy stem  metastasi s, respi ratory  failure 
due to tum our com pressi on, or spinal cord compressio n) will not be eligible to continue study  
treatm ent. 
Specifications for anatomical imaging
CT scan
CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be cont iguous throughout all the anatomic 
region of  interest.
The m ost cri tical CT image acquisit ion parameters for optimal tumour evaluat ion using 
RECIST v1.1 are anatomic coverage, contrast administration, slice thickness, and 
reconstruction interval.
a.Anatomic coverage: Optimal anatomic coverage for most solid t umours is the chest, 
abdo men and pelvis. Coverage should enco mpass all areas of known predilect ion for 
metastases in the disease under evaluat ion and should addit ionally invest igate areas that may 
be involved based on signs and symptoms o f individual participants . Because a lesio n later 
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 108of 154ident ified in a body part not scanned at baseline would be considered as a new lesio n 
represent ing disease progression, careful consideration should be given to the extent of 
imaging coverage at baseline and at subsequent fo llow-up time points. This will enable better 
consistency not only o f tumour measurements but also ident ificat ion of new disease.
b.IV contrast administration : Optimal visualisatio n and m easurement of m etastases in so lid 
tumours requi res consistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrast as well as timing of 
scanning. T ypically , most abdominal imaging is performed during the portal venous phase and 
(optimally) about the sam e time frame after inject ion on each examinat ion. An adequate 
volume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to 
best effect and a consistent method is used on subsequent examinat ions for any  given pat ient. 
It is very  important that the sam e techni que be used at baseline and on fo llow-up examinat ions 
for a given pati ent. For participants who develop contraindicat ions to contrast after baseline 
contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -
enhanced) should be performed should also be based on the tumour ty pe, anatomic location o f 
the disease and should be optimised to allow for comparison to the prior scans if possible. 
Each case should be discussed with t he radio logist to determine if substitution of these other 
approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable fro m that 
point forward. Care must be taken in measurement of TLs on a different modalit y and 
interpretati on of  non-target disease or new lesio ns, since the same lesio n may appear to have a 
different size using a new modalit y. Oral  contrast is recommended to help visualise and 
different iate structures in the abdo men. 
If iodine contrast m edia is medically  contraindica ted at baseline or at any  time during the 
course of the study , the recommended methods are: CT thoracic (chest) examinat ion without 
contrast and abdominal (and pelvis) MRI with contrast. If MRI cannot be performed, CT 
without IV contrast is an option for t he thorax and abdo men (and pelvis) examinat ion. For 
brain imaging, MRI with IV contrast is the preferred method.
c. Slice thickness and r econstruction interval: It is recommended that CT scans be 
perform ed at 5 mm  cont iguous slice thickness and this guidel ine presumes a maximum 5 mm 
thickness in reco mmendat ions for measurable lesio n definit ion. Except ionally , parti cular 
institutions may  perform medically  acceptable scans at slice thicknesses greater than 5 mm. If 
this occurs, the minimum size o f measurable lesions at baseline should be twice the slice 
thickness of the baseline scans.
All window settings should be included in the assessment, particularly in the thorax where 
lung and soft tissue windows should be considered. When measuring lesio ns, the TL  shou ld be 
measured on the same window setting for repeated examinat ions throughout the study . All 
images from each examinat ion shoul d be included in the assessment and not “selected ” 
images of the apparent lesio n.

Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 109of 154MRI Scan
MRI has excellent contrast, spatial a nd tem poral  resol ution; however, there are many image 
acquisit ion variables invo lved in MRI, which greatly impact image qualit y, lesion conspicuit y 
and measurement. Furthermore, the availabilit y of MRI i s variable gl obally . The m odali ty 
used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesio ns should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. Generally , axial  imaging of the abdomen and 
pelvis (and other anatomies [eg, neck]) with T1 and T2 weighted imaging alo ng with 
gadolinium -enha nced imaging can be performed. The field of view , matrix, number of 
excitat ions, phase encoding steps, use of fat suppressio n and fast sequences should be 
optimised for the specific body  part being imaged as well as the scanner utilised. CT of the 
chest is typically  recommended over MRI due to significant motion artifacts (heart, major 
blood vessels, breathing) associated with MRI. It is beyo nd the scope of this appendix to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body  parts and di seases. 
Ideally , the same ty pe of  scanner shoul d be used and the image acquisit ion protocol should be 
followed as closely  as possible to pri or scans. Body  scans shoul d be perform ed wi th 
breath -hold scanning techniques if possible.
More details on the recom mended imaging parameters can be found in the image acquisit ion 
guidelines.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 116of 154Appendix DGuidance Regarding Potential Interactions of Adavosertib 
with Concomitant Medications
The potential for drug -drug interaction described in this protocol are based on findings from in 
vitro studies and clinical experience.
A formal clinical  drug interacti on study  (D6014C00006) evaluating the effect of 
adavosertib on pharmacokinetics of subst rates for CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 has been 
conducted in advanced so lid tumour participants . The results of this study  suggest that 
adavosertib is a weak inhibitor of these enzymes and is unlikely to result in clinically 
significant drug interacti on. 
The fo llowing treatm ents and the m edicat ions listed in this Appendix are prohibited or should 
be used wit h caution. Any further questions regarding conco mitant treatm ents shoul d be 
referred to the Medical Monitor.
Prohibited Medications
Adavosertib is predominan tly metabo lized by CYP3A4. Strong or moderate inhibitors or 
inducers o f CYP3A4 are prohibited unt il addit ional data on drug -drug interactions (DDIs) 
beco mes available. As grapefruit and Seville oranges are known to contain moderate 
inhibitors of CYP3A4, th ese fruits or their products (including marmalade, juice, etc.) 
shoul d be avoi ded while taking adavosertib.
An exploratory  assessment of the effect of aprepitant on adavosertib exposure in 
oncol ogy participants suggests that there is a drug interact ion bet ween adavosertib and 
aprepi tant, as exposure to adavosertib increased by ~40% when aprepitant was 
co-administered with adavosertib. The observed increase in adavosertib exposure is likely 
the resul t of CYP3A4 inhibit ion by aprepitant. This increase in expo sure is statist ically 
significant. At the sel ected maximum tol erated doses (MTDs), this increase may also be 
of clinical importance. Therefore, concomitant treatment with aprepitant and fosaprepitant 
is not allowable per protocol unt il further evaluation. 
Herbal preparations/medicat ions are not allowed throughout the study . These herbal 
medicat ions include but are not limited to those containing: St. John’s wort, kava, ephedra 
(ma huang), gingko bilo ba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), y ohimbe, saw palmetto,
and ginseng. Participants should stop using these herbal medicat ions 7 days prior to first 
dose of adavosertib.
No other anticancer -therapy  (chemotherapy, immunotherapy , horm onal anticancer 
therapy , radi otherapy  [except for palliat ive local radi otherapy ]), bi ological therapy  or 
other novel agent is to be permitted while the participant is receiving study medicat ion. 
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 117of 154Receipt of live virus and live bacterial vaccines is not permitted while the participant is 
receiving study  medicati on and during the 30- day follow -up peri od. Inact ivated flu 
vaccines are permitted.
Medications to be used with Caution
In vitro studies have shown that adavosertib may be a substrate and inhibitor for human 
P-glycoprotein (P -gp). Caution should be exercised when agents that are in hibitors or 
substrates of P -gp are administered concomitant ly with adavosertib (see relevant section 
below).
in vitro transporter studies have shown adavosertib to be an inhibitor of BCRP (IC 50 
5.1μM). This finding is particularly relevant for drugs admin istered orally where 
exposure is normally limited by BCRP -mediated efflux, in particular so me statins, such as 
rosuvastatin. Other drugs where the disposit ion is mediated via BCRP should be 
administered with caution, dose modificat ion considered or substit uted by  an alternative 
drug.
Metformin should be used wit h caution. Adavosertib has been shown to be an inhibitor of 
MATE1 and MATE2K transporters. A drug interaction with substrates of eit her 
transporter cannot be ruled out, the most important substrate k nown to date being 
metformin.
In addit ion, any other drugs should be avo ided at the invest igator ’s discretion if, in their 
opinio n, the co -administration with adavosertib may increase the risk of a clinically significant 
drug interaction.
A list of the mai n CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, P -gp substrates and inhibitors, and BCRP 
substrates are shown below . This is not an exhaust ive list and further details can be found at

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 121of 154Appendix EAdverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Repo rting
E 1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or 
clinical study  parti cipant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relat ionship with this tr eatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no Study treatment has been administered.
E 2 Definitions of serious adverse event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any  study  phase (i e, run -in, treatment, washout, 
follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -partici pant hospi talisat ion or prolongatio n of exist ing hospitalisat ion 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty
Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the participant or may requi re medical  
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Adverse Events (AEs) for malignant tumours reported during a study  shoul d generally  be 
assessed as Serious AEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply , the ‘Important Medical Event ’ 
criterion shoul d be used. In certain situat ions, however, medical judgement on an individual 
event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should be asses sed 
and reported as a Non-Serious AE. For example, if the tumour is included as medical history  
and progression occurs during the study , but the progressi on does not change treatment and/or 
prognosi s of the m alignant tum our, the AE m ay not fulfil the attri butes for being assessed as 
Serious, al though reporting of the progression of the malignant tumour as an AE is valid and 
shoul d occur . Also, some t ypes of malignant tumours, which do not spread remotely after a 
routi ne treatm ent that does not require hospi talization, m ay be assessed as Non -Serious; 
examples in adults include Stage 1 basal cell carcino ma and S tage 1A1 cervical cancer 
removed via cone biopsy .
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601H C00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 122of 154The above instruction applies only when the malignant tumour event in quest ion is a new 
malignant tum our (i e, it is notthe tum our f or whi ch entry  into the study  is a cri terion and that 
is being treated by  the IP  under study  and is not the development of new or progression of 
exist ing metastasis to the tumour under study ). Malignant tum ours that –as part of norm al, if 
rare, progression –undergo transformat ion (eg, Richter's transformat ion of B cell chronic 
lymphocy tic leukaemia into diffuse large B cell lympho ma) should not be considered a new 
malignant tumour .
Life-threatening
‘Life-threatening ’ means t hat the participant was at immediate risk of death fro m the AE as i t 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
participant ’s death. ‘Life-threatening ’ does not m ean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved wit hout hepatic failure).
Hospitalisation
Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital a dmissi ons and/or surgi cal 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the participant was enrolled in the study , provi ded that i t did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical treatment
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi talisat ion, disabilit y or incapaci ty but may jeopardise the participant or may  
requi re medical treatm ent to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of seri ous. 
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean t hat it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisat ion
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 123of 154Intensity rating scale:
The grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Inst itute CTCAE versio n 5.0 will be 
utilised for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned 
CTCAE grades, the recommendation in th e CTCAE cri teria that converts mild, moderate and 
severe events into CTCAE grades should be used. A copy  of the CTCAE can be downloaded 
from the Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion Program websi te (http://ctep.cancer .gov). The applicable 
versio n of CTCAE should be d escribed clearly .  
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix E 2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix
 E 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix
 E 2.
E
3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reason able possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by the drug.
Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the participant actually received the suspect 
drug?  Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect drug?
No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetio logy such 
as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environ mental  factors.
Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally reco mmend or support a 
re-challenge .
Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if perf ormed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124of 154In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni sedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related ’ is made if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal  relati onship is meant to convey , in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment. W ith no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relat ionship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
E 4 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended fa ilure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant 
or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. 
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error:
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances wer e recognised that coul d have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name confusio n
Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the participant
Drug no t administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 125of 154Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should b e at room  temperature 
Wrong participant received the medicat ion
Wrong drug administered to participant
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take m edicati on
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open l abel studi es, even if an Ast raZeneca product 
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 126of 154Appendix FHandling of Human Biological Samples
F 1 Chain of custody
A full chain of custody  is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle .
The invest igator at each centre keeps full traceability of co llected bio logical sam ples f rom the 
participants while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and 
records relevant processing information related to the samples whilst at site.
The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and during use unt il 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward 
shipment or disposal.
AstraZeneca or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the ent ire life cycle through 
internal  procedures, m onitoring of study  sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual 
requi rements of external laboratory  provi ders.
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AstraZeneca -assigned bi obanks or other 
sample archive facilit ies and will be tracked by  the appropri ate AstraZeneca T eam for the 
remainder of the sample life cycle.
If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining bio logical samples are returned to the site 
according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner .
F 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples 
If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical  samples, the sam ples will

International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IA TA) 
(https://www .iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Pages/download.aspx ) classifies infect ious 
substances into 3 categories: Category  A, Category B or Exempt
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwi sehealt hy humans or animals.
Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus. Infectious substances meet ing these 
criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to UN 
2814. Infectious substances which cause disea se only  in animals must be assigned to 
UN2900.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A. Category  B pathogens are eg, Hepatit is A, C, D, and E viruses. They 
are assigned the fo llowing UN number and proper shipping name:
UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category  B
are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt -Substances which do not contain infect ious substances or substances which are 
unlikely  to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless they 
meet the criteria for inclusio n in another class.
Clinical study samples will fall into Category  B or exempt under IATA regulat ions
Clinical study  samples will routinely  be packed and tran sported at ambient temperature in

and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
H 1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to i dentify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy ’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy ’s Law (HL) cases. It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries. 
Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalit ies can be found in Sect ion8.3.6 of the 
Clinical Study  Protocol .
During the course of the study  the invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry . The investigator is responsible for dete rmining whether a participant meets PHL  
criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL  and HL  events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including cent ral and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL  
criteria coul d be m et by  an elevated ALT from a central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL  from 
a local laboratory . 
The invest igator will also review adve rse event (AE) data (for example, for AEs that may 
indicate elevat ions in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL  events.
The invest igator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL  criteria to agree whether HL  criteria are m et. HL  
criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver biochemistry  
other than drug induced liver injury  (DILI) caused by  the Invest igational Medicinal Product 
(IMP). 
The inves tigator i s responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL  cases and for 
reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs according to the outcome o f the review and 
assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
H 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine aminotransferase (AL T) ≥ 3x upper limit of 
norm al (ULN) together  with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any po int during the study  
following the start of study  medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP).
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 132of 154Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together  with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the co mbinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicat ing 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug. 
For PHL  and HL  the el evation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL  must o ccur.
H 3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL  it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  parti cipant who m eets any of the fo llowing identificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3xULN
AST ≥ 3xULN
TBL ≥ 2xULN
Central laboratories being used:
When a participant meets any of the PHL  identification criteria, in iso lation or in co mbinat ion, 
the central  laboratory  will immediately send an alert to the investigator (also sent t o 
AstraZeneca representative). 
The invest igator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the PHL  
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the invest igator will:
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  the central  laboratory  without delay
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  eCRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  local 
laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  results the invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the participant meets PHL criteria (see Section H 2for definit ion) by 
reviewing laborat ory reports from  all previ ous visits (incl uding both central  and l ocal 
laboratory  resul ts)

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 133of 154H 4 Follow -up
H4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the participant does not meet PHL  criteria the investigator will:
Inform  the AstraZeneca representative that the pa rticipant has not met PHL criteria.
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided in 
the Clinical Study  Protocol .
H4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the participant does meet PHL  criteria the investigator will:
Dete rmine whether PHL criteria were met at any  study  visit prior to starting study  
treatm ent (See Secti onH 6).
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central  Study  Team .
Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the invest igator will report the case as an SAE of 
PHL; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y assessment ‘y es/rel ated’ 
according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
For parti cipants that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the invest igator is not 
requi red to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change# in the participant’s 
condi tion.
The Study  Physician contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  parti cipants’ fo llow
-up (including any further laboratory  testing) 
and the continuous review of data.
Subsequent to this contact the invest igator will:
Moni tor the parti cipant until liver bio chemistry  param eters and appropri ate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Complete fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physic ian. This includes deciding which of the tests 
available in the HL lab kit should be used.
Com plete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information beco mes available 
#A ‘significant ’ change in the participant ’s condi tion refers to a clinically  relevant 
chang e in any  of the individual liver biochemistry  param eters (AL T, AST or total bilirubin) in 
isolation or in combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The 
determinat ion of whether there has been a significant change will be at the d iscret ion of the 
investigator, this may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any  uncertaint y.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 134of 154H 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this Section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL  criteria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL  criteria other than DIL I caused by  the 
IMP, and to ensure timely analysis and reporting to healt h authorit ies wit hin 15 calendar days 
from the date PHL  criteria were m et. The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and 
Global Safet y Physician will also be invo lved in this review together wi th other subject matter 
experts as appropriate. 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Wher e ther e is an agr eed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AstraZeneca standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the AL T or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes. 
 The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
 As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay , of over 15 cal endar day s in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 135of 154Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
suppleme ntary informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.
H 6 Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met 
Before and After Starting Study Treatment 
This sect ion is applicable to participants with liver met astases who m eet PHL cri teria on study  
treatm ent, having previously met PHL  criteria at a study  visit prior to starti ng study  treatm ent.
At the first on -study  treatm ent occurrence of PHL criteria being met the invest igator will 
determine if there has been a significant change in the participant ’s condi tion#compared wi th 
the last visit where PHL  criteria were met#
If there is no significant change no action is required
If there is a significant ch ange, notify the AstraZeneca representative, who will 
inform  the central  Study  Team , then foll ow the subsequent process described in 
Secti on H 4.2  
H 7 Actions Required for Repeat Episodes of Potential Hy’s Law
This sect ion is applicable when a participant meets PHL  criteria on study  treatm ent and has 
already met PHL  criteria at a previous on study  treatm ent visi t.
The requi rement to conduct fo llow-up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence. 
The invest igator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL  criteria being 
met and answer the following quest ion:
Was the al ternat ive cause for the previous occurrence of PHL  criteria being met found 
to be the di sease under study  eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe 
infect ion or liver disease or did the participant meet PHL  criteria prior to starting study 
treatm ent and at their first on -study  treatm ent visi t as described in Sect ionH 6of this 
Appendix?
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 136of 154If No: follow the process described in Sect ion H4.2for reporting PHL  as an SAE
If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant change in the partici pant’s condi tion#
compared wi th when PHL  criteria were previously met
If there is no significant change no action is required
If there is a significant change fo llow the process described in Section H4.2for reporting 
PHL as an SAE
# A ‘significant ’ change in the participant’ s condi tion refers to a clinically
 relevant change in 
any of the individual liver biochemistry  param eters (AL T, AST or total b ilirubin) in iso lation 
or in co mbination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determinat ion 
of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion o f the invest igator , this 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.

Cases of Civil Crisis, Natural Disaster, or Public Health 
Crisis
Note: Changes below should be implemented only during study disruptions due to any of or a 
combinat ion of civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis (eg, during quarant ines and 
resul ting site closures, regional travel restrictions, and considerat ions if site personnel or study  
participant beco me infected with SARS -CoV-2 or similar pandemic infect ion) during which 
participants m ay not wi sh to or m ay be unable to visit the study  site for study visits. These 
changes should only be implemented if allowa ble by  local/regi onal guidelines and following 
agreem ent from the sponsor .
J 1 Consent/reconsent of study participants during study 
interruptions
During study  interrupti ons, i t may not be possible for the participants to complete study  visits 
and assessments o n site, and alternat ive means for carrying out the visit s and assessments may  
be necessary , eg, rem ote visits. Consent/reconsent should be obtained for the alternative 
means of carrying out visits and assessments and should be obtained prior to performing th e 
procedures described in Sect ion 8. Local  and regi onal regul ations and/or guidelines regarding 
consent/reconsent of study  parti cipants shoul d be ch ecked and fo llowed. Consent/reconsent 
may be verbal if allowed by local and regional guidelines (note, in the case of verbal 
consent/reconsent, the informed consent form should be signed at the participant ’s next 
contact wi th the study  site). V is
iting the study  sites for the sol e purpose of obtaining 
consent/reconsent should be avo ided.
J 2 Rescreening of participants to reconfirm study eligibility
Addit ional rescreening for screen failure due to study  disrupti on can be performed in 
previously screened part icipants. The invest igator should confirm this with the designated 
study  physician.
In addit ion, during study  disrupt ion there may be a delay between confirming eligibilit y of a 
participant and ei ther enro lment into the study  or commencing of dosing with inves tigational 
product (IP). If this delay  is outsi de the screening window specified in Sect ion 5.4, the 
participant will need to be rescreened to reconfirm eligibilit y before commencing study  
procedures. This will provide another opportunit y to re-screen a participant in addit ion to that 
detailed in Sect ion
 5.4.  The procedures detailed in Sections  5.4must be undertaken to 
confirm eligibilit y using the same rando mizat ion number as for the participant.
J 3 Home or remote visit to replace on -site visit (where applicable)
A qualified healt hcare professio nal (HCP) fro m the study  site or thi rd-party  vendor service 
Clinical Study Protocol –6.0 AstraZeneca
Adavosertib (AZD1775) -D601HC00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 147of 154may visit the participant ’s home or other remote location as per loc al standard operati ng 
procedures, as applicable. Supplies will be provided for a safe and efficient visit. The qualified 
HCP will be expected to collect informat ion per the Clinical Study  Protocol . 
J
4 Telemedicine visit to replace on -site visit (where applic able)
In thi s appendix the term telemedicine visit refers to remote contact with the participants using 
telecommunicat ions techno logy including phone calls, virtual or video visit s, and m obile 
healt h devices.
During a civil crisis, natural disaster, or pub lic health crisis, on -site visi ts may  be replaced by  
a telemedicine visit if allowed by  local/regional guidelines. Having a telemedicine contact 
with the parti cipants will allow adverse events, conco mitant m edicat ions, participant report 
outcom e quest ionnaires, and healt h econo mic data to be reported and documented. 
J 5 At-home or remote location investigational product 
administration instructions
If a site visit is not possible, at -home or remote location administration of invest igational 
product may be perfo rmed by the participant or his/her caregiver . The option of at -home or 
remote locati on invest igational product administratio n ensures participant ’s safet y in cases of 
a pandemic where participants may be at increased risk by traveling to the site/clinic. This will 
also minimize interruption o f investigat ional product administration during other study  
disrupt ions, eg, site closures due to natural disaster .
J 6 At-home or remote location investigational product 
administration by the participant or his/her caregiv er
Prior to at -home or remote location investigational product administration, the investigator 
must assess the participant or his/her caregiver to determine whether they  are appropriate for 
at-home or remote location administration of investigat ional product. Once the participant or 
his/her caregiver is deemed appropriate for at- home or remote location administration, he/she 
must receive appropriate training. All necessary supplies and instructions for administration 
and docum entati on of  invest igational pr oduct administration will be provided. More 
inform ation related to the visit can be obtained via a telemedicine or home/remote visit.
J 7 Data capture during telemedicine or home/remote visits
Data collected during telemedicine or home/remote visits will be ca ptured by  the qualified 
HCP from the study site or third -party  vendor service in the source documents, or by  the 
participant themselves.

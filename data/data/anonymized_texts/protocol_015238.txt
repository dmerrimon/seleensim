A. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Prostate cancer ( PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second most 
common cause of cancer death in US men (3).  Approximately 26,730 men in the US will 
die of PCa in 201 7 (3).  Current methods for detecting and diagnosing PCa are seriously 
flawed since they frequently produce inconsistent and unreliable results, often with high 
cost.  PCa screening is  driven by the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, with 
definitive diagn osis from histologic  analysis of 12–24 tissue cores sampled randomly from 
the prostate with trans -rectal ultrasound (TRUS) -guided biops y.  This approach is prone 
to under -sampling the prostate  (only 1% of the prostate tissue is sampled)  and under -
diagnosing clinically significant PCa.   Typically, only 30% of the first TRUS -guided biops y 
is positive for PCa but u nfortunately , a negative biopsy does not rule out PCa, and repeat 
biopsies  are often required .  Furthermo re, Gleason score —one of the most important 
prognostic factors for PCa—is not reliabl y assessed from TRUS -guided biopsy , and is 
upgraded in 30% of cases in repeat biopsies or prostatec tomies (4, 5).  Every year, 
approximately 1.2 million prostate biopsies are performed in the US  (6), which cost the 
US health c are system an estimated $2 billion/year  (7-10).  As a result, there are currently 
no effective, widely accepted and reliable methods for risk assessment, detection and 
diagnosis of PCa.  Consequently, the number of early cancers detected is also decreasing 
IRB17-1694   Version Date:  06/10/2022

 significantly , and therefore  increased incidence  of metastatic PCa and disease specific 
mortality is expected , beginning in approximately 2017  (11).  In addition , inefficient 
diagnosis algorithms and unreliable risk prediction leads to "overtreatment "—it is 
estimated  that, for 30–40% PCa patients , prostatectomy does not impact survival but 
exposes them to significant complications (impotence and incontinence ).  There is a 
critical and immediate need for accurate  and non-invasive diagnostic tools  to improve 
PCa diagnosis and grading.  At the time of initial diagnosis, we  need  a diagnostic tool  for 
evaluat ion of  the entire prostate , to identify PCa foci, and to differentiate  clinically 
significant cancer  (requires aggressive trea tment ) from indolent disease  (does not require 
aggressive treatment ), to reduce financial, logistical, and emotional costs from PCa and 
improv e the outcome  of PCa management . 
Currently t here is no consensus on the definition of clinically significant prostate cancer .  
In this proposal we define significant cancer based on pa thologic criteria.  For biopsy , 
based on the Canadian recommendations  (12), clinically significant cancers include all 
tumors with Gleason score >6 (3+3)  (ISUP grade group 1), and with Gleason score ≤6 
(3+3)  (ISUP grade group 1) if not localized.    
Multi -parametr ic MRI (MP -MRI) is an MRI protocol optimized for PCa and embraced 
worldwide by the radiology community.  MP -MRI is a combination of two or more of the 
following imaging sequences: T 2-weighted (T 2w), diffusion -weighted (DW), and dynamic 
contrast enhanced (D CE).  One promising solution for improving PCa detection is 
targeted biopsy of the prostate using MP -MRI.  When performed by experts, Mp -MRI 
targeted biopsies result in higher detection rates of clinically significant cancer with a 
reduced upgrading of cancers at surgery, improving confidence in the biopsy results (13-
16).  MR-targeted biopsies can be performed either by fusing MR ima ges to real time US 
images or directly under MR guidance (in -bore MR guided biopsy).  
A.1 Current status and shortcomings of prostate magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI)  
Performance of MRI -targeted biopsy depends on accurate and reproducible interpretation 
of MR images leading to accurate identification of targets for biopsy.  Images from MP-
MRI are compl ementary and synergistic  in diagnostic information , but they are also 
complex and difficult to decipher  by radiologists .  T2w and DW MR images are the 
mainstay of MP-MRI, and can depict PCa with high sensitivity .  T2w and DW-MRI are the 
main  imaging techniques for PI-RADS , the standardized reporting approach to MP-MRI 
(17).  Currently, all commercially available PCa MP -MRI protocols are based on 
subjective and qualitative interpretation by radiologists, and none is truly quantitative, well  
defined, and reproducible.  I nterpretation of prostate MP-MRI varies greatly  among 
radio logists , because of a lack of reproducible  and quantitative MRI acquisition protocols , 
and because of a lack of decision support system (DSS) tools  to assist radiologist s 
interpret  the images .  This problem  is exacerbated by  limited number of  radiologists who 
have substantial experience and expertise in interpretation of prostate MP-MRI.  Success  
of MP -MRI achieved in select centers of excellence cannot be reproduced easily 
worldwide .  We propose to evaluate  a quantitative prostate MRI acquisition protocol , 
and a novel Risk Map DSS tool for image interpretation , to enabl e wide spread  
clinical translation  of PCa MRI.  If these emerging results are reproduced widely, MRI 
has the potential to revolutionize PCa management, reduce unproductive biopsies and 
IRB17-1694   Version Date:  06/10/2022

 unnecessary radical therapies (e.g., prostatectomy and radiation), and achieve more 
accurate and efficient diagnosis, effective follow -up, and targeted eradication of 
aggressive disease.   
We will use a new MRI technique to obtain quantitative tissue composition maps based 
on a new hybrid multi -dimensional MRI (HM -MRI) approach that combines T2 and ADC 
measurements and detects tissue heterogeneity at the microscopic level in an innovative 
way.   
Our group has developed two novel app roach es that have potential to substantially 
improve multi -parametric MRI  in prostate: the kT -T2 sequence  (18-21) and the hybrid 
multi -dimensional MRI (HM -MRI)  (22-25). The kT -T2 sequence provides a direct 
assessment of the prostatic micro -environment and HM-MRI provides an assessment of 
the prostatic tissue micro anatomy which allows us to find water signals that are 
characteristic of cancers.  This is important new information that cannot be obtained  
from conventional T2 and ADC measurements.  
HM-MRI data can be analyzed to produce accurate tissue composition maps showing 
volume  fractions of stroma, epithelia, and lumen.  These maps have been shown in 
preliminary studies from this laboratory to enhance diagnostic accuracy  (26) , as 
summarized in Preliminary Results ( Section A.3.1.).  Inf ormation from these tissue 
composition maps will be incorporated into the DSS tool . 
A.2. Protocol  overview:   
We propose to test a Risk Map DSS image interpretation tool  for automated interpretation 
of prostate MR  using research sequences , which will include quantitative kT -T2, and HM -
MRI acquisition , in the clinical MRI protocol . This will also allow straightforward 
comparison of kT -T2 and HM -MRI vs. conventional T2 and ADC images.   This, in turn, 
will be used for reliable determination of clinically  significant cancer in prostate which will 
be targeted by MR -targeted biopsies at the time of diagnosis.   The goal is to achieve 
clinical translation of advanced and innovative techn ology for accurate and reliable PCa 
diagnosis , to provide patients and tre ating physicians with quantitative and objective data , 
and to enable them to make inform ed treatment decisions.   
A.3. Preliminary results:  
Preliminary results and research accomplishments directly related to this proposal are 
listed below.  
A.3.1 . Tissue composition estimate from HM -MRI data, and correlation with 
histology : 
IRB17-1694   Version Date:  06/10/2022 
Page 4 of 14 
 A preliminary study demonstrates that HM -
MRI has potential to significantly enhance 
the diagnostic accuracy of PCa detection 
and diagnosis (26).  This analysis included 
21 PCa patients who underwent 
preoperative 3 T HM -MRI.  Axial images 
using HM -MRI were acquired with TE = 47, 
75, 100 ms and b-values of 0, 750, 1500 
s/mm2, resulting in a 3×3 array of data for 
each voxel.  Volume fractions of three tissue 
components —epithelium, stroma, and 
lumen —were estimated by fi tting the HM -
MRI data to a three -component  signal model 
(see section c.2.3.iv) with distinct ADC and 
T2 values for each component.  Figure 1 
shows an example Gleason 4+5 cancer 
outlined on H&E slides and superimposed on 
estimated ADC and T2 maps (top row),  
stromal, luminal, and epithelial volume 
fraction maps (2nd row, and 3rd row, left), and 
finally a tissue composition map (3rd row, 
right).  This aggressive cancer is clearly 
evident on conventional ADC and T2 
images, but is shown here with greater 
contras t in the tissue composition map.  We 
analyzed 28 PCa and 71 normal tissue ROIs 
outlined by an expert radiologist.  The 
volume fractions of normal tissue are similar 
to histological  
studies (27-29).  Stromal volume was highest 
in AFMS followed by transition zone, 
epithelium volume was highest in central 
zone, and lumen volume was highest in PZ (Fig. 1, 4th row).  The volume fractions were 
significantly different in cancers than in normal tissue (Table 1 for cancer and normal PZ, 
and Fig. 1, 4th row, for cancer vs. normal tissue in all zones).  PCa has significantly 
increased epithelium than normal tissue (48.8±9.2 vs. 23.2±7.1%), reduced lume n 
(14.0±5.2 vs. 26.4±14.1%), and 
reduced stroma (37.2±9.1 vs. 
50.5±15.7%) fractional volumes.  
The volume fractions also 
correlate more strongly with 
Gleason Score (ρ = 0.65 for 
epithelium, -0.44 for stroma, and 
-0.39 for lumen) than T 2 (ρ = -
0.29) and ADC  (ρ = -0.32).  The

 PCa from normal tissue was 0.99 for epithelium, 0.80 for lumen, 0.79 for stroma, and 0.71 
for T 2 (AUC for ADC was not evaluated because cancer ROIs were outlined in ADC 
maps).  These results suggest that HM -MRI non -invasively provides 3 -dimensional 
information that is similar to the information obtained from 2D ex vivo histology slices, and 
that prostate tissue composition measured non -invasively by using HM -MRI have 
potential to improve PCa diagnosis and ass essment of PCa aggressiveness.  The study 
also resulted in a filed patent application (30). 
A.3.2. PCa risk maps derived from quantitative MRI data  
We have developed a preliminary risk map based 
on mpMRI: ADC, T2, and DCE signal enhancement 
rate (α).  These parameters were calculated on a 
voxel -by-voxel basis for the entire, co -registered 
prostate.  Each parameter was normalized (to 0 -
100) with low T2, low ADC, and high α signify high 
risk.  The final risk score is a weighted sum of the 
parameters (ADC 40%, T2 40%, DCE 20%) with 
higher risk for low T2, low ADC, and high α values.  
We analyzed preoperative 3T mpMRI of 22 PCa 
patients, and used five pa tients as the training set 
to find the optimal threshold for predicting PCa and 
17 patients as the test set.  A sector -based analysis 
(18 sectors per prostate) on the 17 test patients 
showed the following PCa detection performance: 
sensitivity 75% (105/140 ), specificity 89% 
(147/166), positive predictive value 85% (105/124), 
negative predictive value 81% (147/182), and AUC 0.82 (95% CI [0.77, 0.87]).  
Importantly, the risk map correctly identified all index lesions.  This study suggests that 
the risk map ca n detect PCa and guide targeted biopsies for improved PCa diagnosis.  
A.3.3. Pilot DSS study:  
We developed a pilot DSS based on T 2w and DW -MRI (31).  A radiologist and a 
pathologist identif ied 104 ROIs (61 cancer and 43 normal tissue) based on correlation of 
histological and MR findings.  AUC values in the differentiation of PCa from normal tissue 
foci of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC and T 2w skewness were 0.92, 0.89, and 0.86 
respectivel y.  The combination of the 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, and T 2w 
skewness yielded an AUC value of 0.95 for the same task.  Gleason score correlated 
moderately with the 10th percentile ADC (ρ= -0.34, p=0.008) and with the average ADC 
value (ρ= -0.30, p=0.02).  The combination of 10th percentile ADC, average ADC, and 
T2w skewness were promising in differentiation of PCa from normal tissue, and ADC 
image features correlated moderately with Gleason score (31). 
A.3.4 . Validation study of pilot DSS:  
We validated the pilot Risk Map DSS on preoperative 1.5T MP -MR images (with 
endorectal coil) of 119 PCa patients (GE scanners, n=71; Philips scanners, n=48) and 
265 PCa and normal peripheral zone  ROIs identified through histology -MR consensus 
review (32).  AUC values of the pilot DSS image  features combined were 0.95 and 0.88  
Figure 2 .  Representative example of developed risk map

 on the Philips and GE dataset (leave -one-patient -out evaluation), respectively, and 0.96 
and 0.89 when training on the GE dataset and testing on the Philips dataset, and vice 
versa, respectively.  Spearman correlation coefficients between ROI -specific Gleason 
scores and the ADC features were between -0.27 and -0.34.  This previous work (32) 
demonstrates that a pilot DSS tool developed based on data from Philips scanners can 
be effective with data from other scanners, and supports the feasibility of the proposed 
Risk Map DSS tool.  
 
B. PURPOSE  
The purpose of the proposed research is to test and validate an artificial intelligence -
based Risk Map decision -support system (DSS) for PCa MRI interpretation and 
identification of clinically significant tumor site based on MRI acquisition of  a 
protocol c overing the entire prostate which will include the kT -T2 and the hybrid 
multi -dimensional MRI (HM -MRI) sequences.    
We will test an artificial intelligence -based Risk Map DSS tool we have developed, which 
is based on and expanded from previously identified  key MR image features that are 
effective for identifying PCa from normal prostate tissue, and which also correlate s 
moderately with Gleason scores (ADC, T2, and tissue composition maps).  The DSS tool 
will assist radiologists interrogate suspicious areas in the prostate that are potentially 
clinically significant PCa foci, and will identify up to two potential clinically significant tumor 
sites.  In addition to systematic biopsies  and the targets identified by the radiologist , up 
to two targets determined by the DSS tool will be biopsied.  Biopsy histology results of all 
cores will be used as the reference standard to evaluate the performance of the Risk Map 
DSS tool.  
 
C. METHODOLOGY  
C.1. Study Design:  
This is a prospective, single -arm, unblinded study of patients with known or suspected 
prostate cancer.  A total of 125 patients will be enrolled.  
Recruitment: We will recruit patients with known or suspected prostate cancer who have 
been referred to the Department of Radiology at the University of Chicago Me dical Center 
for a diagnostic MRI exam of the prostate, to be followed by an MRI -guided fusion biopsy 
of the prostate, per standard clinical protocol.  
All patients will be scanned using a standard clinical prostate MRI protocol. Research 
sequences will be added to the routine clinical exam. The research sequences will not 
exceed 15 minutes. The patients will not receive intravenous contrast agent as part of the 
research protocol.  
All patients will then undergo a 12 -core TRUS -guided or transperineal US -guided sextant 
random  biopsy  by the ir urologist  at the Urology Clinic as their standard of care treatment . 
Additional biopsy targets may be selected based on an expert radiologist's interpretation 
of the patient’s clinical MRI, as part of the clinical, standard of care MR targeted biopsy 
procedure.   Up to two additional biopsy targets  per patient will be selected by the Risk 
IRB17-1694   Version Date:  06/10/2022 
Page 7 of 14 
 Map DSS tool , if different from the already selected targets by the radiologist per standard 
of care.  Ultimately,  the clinical radiologist will make the final decision on the targets to be 
biopsied .  MR -targeted biopsies will be done by using a  Uronav MR -US fusion device .  
The following results will be recorded for each core: (1) the reason of biopsy (random 
biopsy; DSS tool alone; radiologist alone ) (2) location (sextant and zone), and (2) 
histology result.  Research cores will be evaluated by expert genitourinary pathologist,  
Dr. Antic , and results will be communicated to the urologist.   
Studies will be carried out using FDA approved 3 Tesla Philips , GE and Siemens  MRI 
units at the University of Chicago Medical Center.  All of the research MR sequences will 
be in compliance with FDA safety requirements and MR contrast agents will not be 
injected for research purposes . 
C.2. MRI Data acquisition methods:  
The data acquisition will consist of obtaining the standard clinical protocol and research 
sequen ces, in compliance with FDA safety requirements. Research sequences may 
include, but will not b e limited to (1) kT -T2 sequence (high spatial resolution axial ME -
TSE for T 2 measurements and anatomy visualization), and (2) axial HM -MRI with 4 b -
values and 4 TEs for diffusion and T2 measurements.  MR images will be acquired using 
Philips , GE or Siemens  3T clinical MR systems with a phased array surface receiver coil.  
C.3. Study Endpoints and Statistical  Analysis  
The major goal of this study is to compare the accuracy of the Risk Map DSS tool against 
the clinical accuracy of experienced radiologists in t he context of the reference standard 
of biopsy histology.  The primary endpoints will be ROC curve, AUC value, the secondary 
endpoint will be sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV, and the tertiary endpoint will be 
correlation strength between the DSS too l output and tumor -specific Gleason scores.  
Both per -patient and per -tumor analyses will be conducted.  For the per -patient analysis, 
patients who are diagnosed with PCa from the biopsy procedure will be considered as 
positive for PCa, and patients who ar e not diagnosed with PCa from the biopsy procedure 
will be considered as negative for PCa.  For the per -tumor analysis, each individual PCa 
tumor diagnosed from the biopsy procedure will be analyzed separately, and biopsy sites 
that do not yield PCa diagno sis will be considered as negative for PCa.  To ascertain a 
true positive biopsy, the finding and the biopsy must match in sextant and zone.  If 
ambiguity in biopsy site arises with regard to indication s from the DSS tool, or the 
radiologist's opinion, and  the biopsy, e xpert radiologist (Dr. Oto) and pathologist (Dr. 
Antic) will review each case to make the determination .  This will allow us to calculate the 
performance of : (1) the Risk Map DSS tool, (2) the radiologist , and (2) the standard 
sextant biopsy .  We will evaluate these performance endpoints on clinically significant 
PCa (but we will have data for all tumors).  Spearman correlation coefficient will be 
estimated in the usual manor.  
C.4. Statistical  power consider ation  
We expect the following  level of performance: AUC 0.90±0.0 3, sensitivity 90± 5%, 
specificity 90± 4%, and statistically significant (Spearman's) correlation strength of 0.8 
with tumor -specific Gleason scores.  Variances are estimated based on the expect ation 
of PCa diagnosis in 35% of 125 patients, and based on an empirical rule -of-thumb formula 
IRB17-1694   Version Date:  06/10/2022 
Page 8 of 14 
 for AUC and binomial probability for sensitivity and specificity.  The estimated 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) are: for AUC [0.8 7, 0.93], for sensitivity [0.8 5, 0.95], and for 
specificity [0.8 6, 0.94].  These uncertainty estimates do not include analysis of biopsy by 
sextant and zone of the 12 -20 cores per patient; estimates of 12 by -location -analyses per 
patient reduce all uncertainties to about 1%.  These estim ates suggest that this protocol  
will produce meaningful performance estimates.   
 
D. DURATION OF THE PROTOCOL  
The probable  duration of the study will be 3  years with review, at least annually, to recruit 
the target number of patients and complete all data analysis.  
 
E. LOCATION WHERE RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED  
The study will be conducted on the FDA approved 3 Tesla Philips , GE or Siemens  MRI 
scanners at the University of Chicago Medical Center, 5841 South Maryland Avenue, 
Chicago, IL 60637.  
 
F. SAFETY MONITORING  
We do not anticipate any adverse events. However, adverse events related directly to the 
study will be reported to the Cancer Center Clinical trials office following standard 
operating procedures outlined in the Cancer Center data safety and mon itoring plan.  
 
G.  DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTAL CONTROLS AND USE OF PLACEBOS

to the Department of Radiology at the University of Chicago Medical Center for a 
diagnostic MRI exam of the prostate, to be f ollowed by an MRI -guided fusion biopsy of 
the prostate.  Written informed consent will be signed by the patients before the MRI 
examination .

Page 9 of 14 
  Subjects who cannot adhere to the experimental protocols for any reason, 
or have an inability to communicate with the researcher;  
 Subjects with psychiatric disorders that affect their ability to consen t for 
themselves will be excluded and not the entire population of patients with 
psychiatric disorders .

chemotherapy) for prostate cancer.  
 
Data to be collected  
Demographic information will be collected from each recruited subject. The research team 
will also collect  clinic visit,  laboratory, imaging and pathology results relevant to the clinical 
question for each subject.  
 
J. SHARING RESEARCH RESULTS : 
At times, the advancement of research or the development of healthcare devices is aided 
by the sharing of de -identified image data, pathology data, genetic data and clinical 
information with other organizations. De -identified copies of image data, pathology data, 
genetic data and clinical information may be sent outside of The University of Chicago for 
such purposes, including as part of an image library. If this occurs, scientists outside of 
The University of Chicago will be u nable to identify the subject from medical images, 
pathology data, genetic data or from clinical information, because all identifying 
information will have been removed from the images and records. Insurance agencies 
will not have access to this informatio n. 
 
K. POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS  
Risks Associated with Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
The risks below are the risks of standard MR imaging which the patients will undergo for 
clinical indications. The research component will not cause any additional risk to the 
existing minimal risks of clinical MR imaging. The research sequences will be de signed 
in compliance  with FDA requirements , and intravenous contrast material will not be 
administered for research purposes.    
The presence of devices, implants, or other objects containing metal : Metal objects pose 
a serious risk to all patients undergo ing MRI exams. This includes internally implanted 
objects such as surgical clips, biosupport devices (e.g., pacemakers), and artificial joints 
which contain metal.  
Claustrophobia:  Some individuals may experience claustrophobia during the MRI exam 
due to t he limited space available inside the bore of the magnet.  
IRB17-1694   Version Date:  06/10/2022 
Page 10 of 14 
 Breach of confidentiality: There is a minimal risk that patient confidentiality may be 
breached.  
 
Protection against risks  associated with MRI  
Protection against risks related to presence of metals, devices and other metal containing 
material: Participants are questioned carefully before MRI imaging to insure that they do 
not have metal implants. Prospective study participants who have such impla nts will be 
excluded from the study.  Patients who have worked in or near machine shops and 
electronics shops and may have  had metal slivers become trapped in the ir eyes, posing 
a potential hazard if exposed to a strong magnetic field , will also be exclude d from the 
study .  In addition, metal objects such as heavy key chains that are carried into the scan 
room can cause serious accidents.   Participants will be cautioned to remove all metal 
objects before entering the scan room.  Access to the scan room is carefully controlled to 
insure that no ferrous metal is inadvertently brought in.  
Protection against claustrophobia: Prospective participants will be counseled about this 
possibility before the exam.  The magnet is equipped with an intercom system enabling  
study subjects to communicate with the operators at any time during the exam. If they 
report any discomfort during the MRI examination they will be removed from the magnet 
immediately.  
Protection again st the breach of confidentiality: Patient identifiers will be kept and used 
only for the purpose of correlating patient data between radiology,  urology and pathology.  
Patient identifiers will be removed from data anal ysis unles s it become s necess ary to 
correlate results of the analysis to other clinica l data, which we do not e xpect.  Patient 
identifiers will be removed from all presen tations and publica tions; only data from a group 
of patients will be reported so that data from any individua l patient cann ot be identified. 
 
Risks associated with Transrectal and Transperineal Ultrasound -Guided Prostate 
Biopsy:  
The risks will be those associated with  standard MRI-guided fusion biopsy  of the prostate , 
which the patients will undergo for clinical indications . The research component  (upto two 
additional biopsy targets)  will cause a minimal increase in the risk of bleeding and 
infection . 
 
Benefits  
There may or may not be any direct medical benefit to patients who are enrolled in the 
study.  
There  will be  a long-term benefit  to society  in general  if this research  leads  to the 
development of a new technology  that improves  clinical  practice.  
 
Alternatives  
IRB17-1694   Version Date:  06/10/2022

 If patients decide not to participate in this study, they will undergo routine clinical 
examination ordered by their referring physician.  
 
L. PAYMENT TO SUBJECTS  
Patients will not be paid or compensated for their participation in this study.  
 
M.  OBTAINING WRITTEN CONSENT  
The Principal Investigator or Co -Investigators or the Clinical Research Coordinator will be 
responsible for ob taining written informed consent signatures from the patients based on 
the research plan and consent form approved by University of Chicago Institutional 
Review Board.  
Confidentiality will be insured by use of an encrypted patient ID numbering system for all 
research data to maintain confidentiality and anonymity.  
 
N. CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS  
In accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Federal Food and Drug 
Administration, all records will be treated with strict adherence to professional standards 
of confidentiality. Care will be taken during the review of medical records to maintain as 
much privacy as possible. Only the treating physician or study staff will review the medical 
records. Records will be kept locked, and the database will ha ve restricted access 
(password protected).  
Security and Privacy : 
This protocol is designed to respect proper attention to patient privacy and prevention of 
breach of confidentiality. For each patient, the study protocol number and the patient`s 
medical rec ord number will be entered into a restricted database by selected research 
personnel. Additional relevant general clinical information will be included. Access to the 
database will be password protected. All personnel are trained to maintain confidentialit y 
of patient information according to HIPAA regulations. All of the images will be maintained 
in the password protected University of Chicago PACS.  
Research charts, including signed consent forms, will be stored in a locked file cabinet in 
the clinical res earch coordinator’s office at University of Chicago Medical Center, Room 
Q200.  Although each chart, radiographic study, and MRI examination will contain the 
patient’s name, and as such will not be anonymous, no individual identities will be used 
in any pu blications resulting from this study.  Officials from examining bodies such as the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration or NIH may inspect records pertaining to this study.  
 
O. PATIENT RECRUITMENT:  
We will recruit patients referred by the UCMC Urology Depar tment, who are scheduled 
for diagnostic MRI exam of the prostate, to be followed by an MRI -guided fusion biopsy 
of the prostate . In addition, patients may also be referred to the study team from other 
IRB17-1694   Version Date:  06/10/2022 
Page 12 of 14 
 medical centers/hospitals.  The study protocol will be discussed with the patient and the 
study coordinators will consent the patient.

Title of Study:  
AN OPEN LABEL PHASE 1B/2 TRIAL OF TRC105 AND SORAFENIB IN PATIENTS WITH 
HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC)  
Study center(s): This study will be performed at approximately 5 US centers  (sites to be 
determined).  
Investigators: To be determined  
Studied period (years):  
Date first patient enrolled  phase 1 b portion : Nov 2016  
Estimated Date phase 1 b MTD obtained: January 2018 
Estimated date first patient enrolled p hase 2 portion: March  2018  
Estimated date pha se 2 endpoint obtained: May 2019 
Estimated date last patient completed: May 2019 Phase of development: 1b/2 
 
Rationale:  
Sorafenib  is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting several receptor tyrosine kinases, including the VEGF 
receptor (VEGFR),  implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression.  
Sorafenib is approved for the treatment of unresecta ble hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC) . TRC105 is an 
antibody to endoglin , an important angiogenic target on proliferating  endothelial cells that is distinct 
from VEGFR.  TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases and complements the 
activity of  bevacizumab and multi -kinase inhibitors that target  the VEGFR  in preclinical models .  
Together, the use of TRC105 with sorafenib may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and 
improved clinical efficacy over that seen with sorafenib  alone.    
A phase 1b /2 study of TRC105 with  standard dose sorafenib was conducted by the NCI .  Twenty  
patients were  treated with sorafenib (400  mg BID) and 3, 6, 10 or 15mg/kg TRC105 every 2 weeks. The 
majority of  patients had HCC with cirrhosis and compensated liver d ysfunction (Childs Pugh A/B7) and 
an ECOG of 0/1. Overall , treatment was tolerable  and the study proceeded as per protocol to the 
maximum planned dose level of TRC105 (15mg/kg every 2 weeks)  in combination with 400 mg BID of 
sorafenib . Dose limiting transa minase elevation was encountered in a single patient at 10  mg/kg of 
TRC105 every 2 weeks and the cohort was expanded. One grade 5 cardiac event  of myocardial 
infarction in a patient with preexisting coronary artery disease  was observed  in which the contrib ution of 
protocol treatment could not be excluded. The most common side -effect was  hand -foot skin reaction  
attributed to sorafenib. Four  of 10 patients (40%) treated at the top two dose levels of TRC105  (10 
mg/kg every two weeks and 15 mg/kg  every two weeks) had RECIST defined partial responses  and the 
majority of patients had tumor reductions.

 An additional partial response was reported in one of the initial four patients treated in the Phase 2 
portion of the study.  Median time on study was 4 months and one pat ient remained on treatment for  22 
months.  
Given the results from the phase 1b portion of the NCI study , TRACON is conducting this multicenter 
phase 1b/2 study  to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of TRC105 with standard dose  sorafenib .  
This study includes a n initial  phase 1b dose escalation portion in order to assess the safety of  TRC105 
given at 10 mg/kg weekly for four weeks followed by 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks by i.v. infusion  with daily 
sorafenib . A maximum of 21 additional  patients will be treated in the phase 2 portion  to assess the 
overall response rate to TRC105 and sorafenib . The recommended phase 2 dose of TRC 105 is 10 mg/kg 
weekly in combination with 400 mg sorafenib twice daily .  Ongoing patients in the Phase 1b portion 
of this study may, at the discretion of the investigator, be treated at the Phase 2 TRC105 dose of 
10 mg/kg weekly.  
Objectives:  
Phase 1 b: 
Primary:  
• To determine a  recommended phase 2 dose for TRC105 by i.v. infusion when given with  
standard dose sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma

 • To evaluate TRC105 immunogenicity as measured by APA  
• To explore changes in circulating angiogenic biomarkers following treatment with TRC105 
and sorafenib  
• To prospectiv ely assess IGF-1-modified Child -Pugh score [1] and outcomes in patients with 
HCC treated with sorafenib and TRC105  
Methodology:  
Phase 1 b: 
This is a multicenter, open -label, nonrandomized, phase 1b, dose -finding study of TRC105 in 
combination with standard dose sorafenib  in patients with unresectable HCC .  Escalating doses of i.v. 
TRC105 will be administered weekly or every two weeks, begin ning with Dose Level 1 in combination 
with oral sorafenib  given at 400 mg twice daily  of each 28-day cycle.  Sorafenib dose modifications  are 
allowed starting in cycle  1, per the package insert and as outlined in section Section  7.8.6 .

aAdditional intermediate doses (below the MTD established during the trial) may be explored based upon clinical, 
PK, and/or biomarker data 
bTRC105 will be administered weekly during cycle 1. The first weekly TRC105 dose will be split into two doses 
whereby 3 mg/kg is administered on cycle 1 day 1 and the balance is administered on cycle 1 day 4. Starting on 
cycle 2 day 1 and beyond, TRC105 will be administered every two weeks on days 1 and 15.  
Patients will be initially enrolled and treated at dose level  1. If <33% of  patients experience  a dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 56-day evaluation period  (cycle 1through the end of cycle 2) , dose 
escalation will proceed following review of safety data with appropriate site staff including the principal 
investigators at all sites.   At least 6 patients will be evaluated at the MTD (or highest dose administered 
if MTD is not reached) to confirm safety and tolerability.  Additional patients ma y be enrolled  at Dose 
Level 1 (as long as it does not exceed the MTD) to obtain additional safety and PK information.  
If 1 of 3 patients experiences DLT, the dose level will be expanded to 6 patients.  The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded if ≥ 33% of patients experience DLT at a given dose 
level .  DLT will have occurred when a patient has 1 or more toxicity listed in the table below that is at 
least po ssibly related to TRC105 during the first 56 days (cycle 1  and 2 ).  Patients who exit the study for 
reasons other than DLT prior to completion of the 56-day DLT evaluation period will be replaced to 
ensure an adequate safety assessment at each dose level.  Patients who experience DLT  and those 
without DLT who receive less than the pr escribed dose of sorafe nib due to documented toxicity in Cycle 
1 or 2 will be considered evaluable for dose escalation purposes.   Upon agreement of the study 
investigators, a  given TRC105 do se level may be reenrolled at  400 mg daily or 400 mg every other day  
of sorafenib  and/or the first dose of TRC105 may be delayed by one week (i .e., delayed to cycle 1 
day 8).

Phase 1 b: 
Dosing will begin at  10 mg/kg  weekly in cycle 1 and 15 mg/kg  every two weeks  beginning with cycle 
2(Dose Level 1); however,  a -1 dose level has also been included of 10  mg/kg  weekly in cycle 1 and 10 
mg/kg  every two weeks beginning with cycle 2  that will be enrolled if Dose Level 1  is found to exceed 
the MTD.   Upon agreement of the study investigators, a given TRC105 dose level may be reenrolled at  
400 mg daily or 400 mg every other day of sorafenib  and/or the first dose of TRC105 may be delayed by

weekly TRC105 dose will be split into two doses whereby 3 mg/kg is administered on cycle 1 day 1 and 
the balance is administered on cycle 1 day 4. Beg inning with cycle 1 day 8 and for the rest of cycle 1, the 
full (e.g., 10 mg/kg) TRC105 dose will be administered i.v. weekly.  Starting on cycle 2 day 1 and 
beyond, TRC105 will be administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg  (Dose Level 1) every two weeks on days 1  
and 15 of each 28 -day cycle .        
Phase 2:  
 Following completion of the Phase 1 portion of the study and discussions of Phase 1 safety and PK data 
with the study principal investigators, continuous weekly dosing with TRC105 at 10 mg/kg was selected 
as the recommended Phase 2 dose  in combination  with 400 mg sorafenib twice daily.   Ongoing patients 
in the Phase 1b portion of this study may, at the discretion of the investigator, be treated at the Phase 2 
TRC105 dose of 10 mg/kg weekly .  Following  the appropriate premedication regimen, TRC105 is to be 
administered intravenously .

 Duration of treatment:  
Patients are eligible for treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of 
consent, or other reasons.  Phase 1 b patients may be withdrawn for DLT, but DLT  does not mandate 
withdrawal if the DLT resolves and can be treated (i.e., a first dose infusion reaction).  A patient should 
be withdrawn from study treatment if, in the opinion of the Investigator, it is medically necessary, or if it 
is the wish of the patient.  In addition, patients will be w ithdrawn from treatment in the case of:  
1. RECIST 1.1 -defined disease progression. In cases where RECIST cannot be applied, 
progression should be based on unequivocal evidence of progressive disease sufficient to 
require a change in therapy.  
2. A need for antica ncer surgery, radiation, or for other anticancer therapy not specified in the 
protocol.  
3. Lost to follow -up or noncompliant.  
4. Any TRC105 dose delay > 2 days in cycle 1  (phase 1 b only)  unless discussed with sponsor.  
5. Pregnancy.  Pregnant patients should be foll owed for the duration of the pregnancy and the 
outcome of the pregnancy should be documented.  
6. Arterial thrombosis of any grade (including cerebrovascular ischemia, cardiac 
ischemia/infarction, or peripheral or visceral arterial ischemia), grade 3 or 4 veno us 
thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism), grade > 2 intracranial hemorrhage, grade 3 or 
4 non -CNS hemorrhage. Grade 2 non -CNS hemorrhage does not mandate withdrawal if the 
underlying condition is treatable.  Grade 1 intracranial hemorrhage does not man date 
withdrawal and may be treated with dose interruption if the patient is benefitting from 
treatment.   
7. Missed study drug treatment for > 8 consecutive weeks  (i.e., both TRC105 and sorafenib 
dosing held ).  Patients who cannot tolerate sorafenib  and who demonstrate a response of 
complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) and are thought to 
benefit from continued single agent TRC105 therapy may continue on study on TRC105 
alone. 
Parameters to be assessed:  
Safety :  
Safety assessments will include physical exams, performance status, laboratory results (complete blood 
counts and serum chemistry) and 12 -lead ECG’s, and additional studies as clinically indicated.  Safety 
parameters will be reviewed by a chartered  Safety Review Team  that reviews  data for all TRC105 
studies quarterly.  In addition, recurring teleconferences will be held with Investigators at all clinical sites  
(Section  9.4).   
 
Pharmacokinetics : 
Serum TRC105 and sorafenib concentrations will be measured using validated methods at the time  
points specified in the Schedule of Events.  
Immunogenicity:  
Serum will be  evaluated  using validated methods at time points specified in the Schedule of Events.

 Exploratory Biomarkers:  
Concentrations of a panel of angiogenic protein biomarkers in plasma will be measured at baseline and 
during treatment to explore TRC105 pharmacodynamics.  Archival tumor specimens will be collected for 
assessment of endoglin expression . 
Efficacy : 
RECIST 1.1 will be applied to measurable disease to assess response and progression.   
Statistical methods:  
Evaluable Study Population:  
Phase 1 b: 
The study population for safety and efficacy includes all patients receiving at least a portion of 1 dose of 
TRC105.  
The number of patients to be enrolled in this study will depend upon the observed safety profile, which 
will determine the number of patients per dose level and the number of dose escalations.  It is anticipated 
that a total of approximately 6 patient s wil l be enrolled in the phase 1b portion . 
The probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each underlying true DLT rate is shown in the 
table below.  For example, for a toxicity that occurs in 5% of patients, there is a > 95% probability of 
escalati ng.  Conversely, for a common toxicity that occurs with a rate of 70%, the probability of 
escalating is < 5%.  
Probability of Escalation to the Next Dose for Each True Underlying DLT Rate at a Dose Level  
True Underlying DLT 
Rate  5% 10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70% 80%  90%  
Probability of Escalating 
Dose  0.97 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.01 0.001  
The probability of failing to observe toxicity in a sample size of 3 or 6 patients given various true 
underlying toxicity rates in shown in the table below.  For  example, with 6 patients, the probability of 
failing to observe toxicity occurring at least 40% of the time is < 5%.

 Phase 2:  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint of the phase 2 study is objective response (CR or PR) at any time during 
treatment.  The sample size is determined using Simon’s two -stage minimax design.   This design will be 
used to test the null hypothesis that the true objective tu mor response rate is < 5% versus the alternative 
hypothesis that the true response rate is > 20%.  
One or more responses by RECIST 1.1 must be observed in the initial 12  patients enrolled to enroll the 
second stage, to a total of 21 patients .  Three  or more responses by RECIST  of 21  patients will be 
considered sufficiently interesting to warrant further study in later trials.   
 
Phase 2 Sample size justification:  
With an alpha level of 0.1 and 80% power, a maximum of 21 treated patients will be requir ed to evaluate 
the ORR.   Twelve patients will be treated in stage 1.   If < 1 objective response is observed in the first 12 
patients, then the trial will be terminated, and the alternative hypothesis that the true ORR probability is 
> 20 % will be rejected .  However, if one or more responses are observed in the first 12 patients, then the 
study will be expanded to enroll a total of 21 treated patients (9 additional patients to be treated in stage 
2).  At the end of the study, if > 3 objective responses are observed then the null hypothesis that the true 
response rate probability is < 5% will be rejected and further investigation of TRC105 and sorafenib in 
this population is warranted. Under this design, the expected sample size is 21. The probability of earl y 
termination under the null hypothesis is 50%.  
The study will continue to enroll patients after the 12th patient has been enrolled unless no response is 
observed. If there is no patient achieving response at the time the 12th patient has been enrolled, th e 
enrollment will be stopped temporarily. Once one patient is observed to have response, the enrollment 
will be resumed. However, if there is  no patient achieving response after the first 12 patients have been 
fully evaluated, the study will be stopped for  the futility .

 3. BACKGROUND  
3.1. Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy with a 
median survival of 6 -9 months  [3], [4]. The approach to treating HCC has traditionally 
comprised o f locoregional strategies ; surgery (partial resection or transplantation) and 
interventiona l radiologic procedures, such as chemoembolization or ablative techniques remain 
the only treatments that are potentially  curable. However, the publication of the landmark 
SHARP study established sorafenib as a standard consideration in unresectable  diseas e and set 
the bar for future studies of systemic therapy [5]. 
3.1.1.  Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): sorafenib and angiogenesis  
Sorafenib is an oral multi -kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor  
(VEGFR) , the platelet -derived growth factor  (PDGF) receptor, and Raf  [5, 6], that improved 
overall survival in HCC in a  phase III randomized, placebo -controlled study (10.7  months 
overall survival with sorafenib versus  7.9 months  with placebo ; HR 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87; 
P<0.001) which  resulted in the adoption of sorafenib monotherapy as the standard of care for 
patients with HCC who are not eligible for, or have had disease progression after, surgical or 
locoregional therapies. A second major study conducted in A sia in predominantly Hepatitis B 
patients confirmed the treatment effect of sorafenib  [6]. In that study overall survival was 6.5 
months with sorafenib versus 4.2 months  with placebo (p =0.014).   The overall response rate in 
these studies was <2% by RECIST.  Despite the survival improvement with sorafenib, pat ients 
eithe r progress or do not respond at the outset.  Resistance is not the result of receptor mutation, 
but rather appears to result from the development of escape pathways that mediate VEGF 
resistance.  Endoglin (CD105) is a pathway implicated in resistance  to VE GF inhibition.  
3.2. CD105 and Angiogenesis  
CD105 (endoglin) is a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein that was initially identified as a 
human leukemia -associated antigen [7] and later also found on endothelial cells [8, 9].  CD105 is 
a TGF -β coreceptor that is essential for angiogenesis [10, 11] and CD105 is strongly expressed 
on the proliferating vascular endothelium of solid tumors [9, 12], including HCC .  All of these 
properties make CD105 an attractive target for the antiangiog enic therapy of cancer [13].  In 
animal models, CD105 targeted therapy has demonstrated both vascular targeting effects and 
antiangiogenic effects by inducing regression of established tumors as well as by preventing new 
tumor formation and inhibiting expansion of existing tumors [9, 14-17]. Therefore, CD105 offers 
a novel alternative target relative to the VEGF inhibitors currently available for antiangiogenesis 
therapy.   
CD105 acts to modulate signaling of multiple kinase receptor complexes of the TGF -β 
superfamily, including TGF -β receptors, activin receptor -like kinases (ALKs) and activin 
receptors [18] and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) .  CD105 expression is required for 
endothelial cell prolifer ation, and CD105 is upregulated in the setting of  hypoxia through the 
induction of hypoxia -inducible factor -1-α (HIF -1-α) [19, 20].  CD105 has also been shown to 
protect hypoxic cells from apoptosis [21].  The expres sion of CD105 by endothelial cells is 
essential for the development of new vascu lature.  Targeted inactivation (knockout) of murine

 CD105 results in defective vascular development.  Mice lacking CD105 die in utero  from 
defective vascular development by gestational d ay 11 [11].   
CD105 is critical for normal human bl ood vessel development [22].  CD105 haplotype 
insufficiency causes a well -described syndrome known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 
type 1 (HHT -1 or Osler -Weber -Rendu  syndrome).  HHT -1 is a r are autosomal dominant genetic 
disorder characterized by localized angiodysplasia involving the nasal, buccal, gastrointestinal 
mucosa and skin microvasculature.  Angiodysplasia also occurs in vessels from internal organs 
including the lungs, liver and bra in [23].  The g enotype is manifested in utero , but the phenotype 
does not become apparent for many years following birth.  Affected patients commonly present 
with epistaxis in the second decade of life.  The phenotype of this disorder is characterized by  
vascula r effects , emphasiz ing the dominant  role of CD105 in vascular development  [24].  
Notably, HHT -1 is associated with superior overall cancer survival [Duarte].  
CD105 is highly expressed on the proliferating endothelial cells of tumor vessels  including lung, 
breast, colorectal, gastric, hepatocellular , endometrial, renal cell , head and neck, and ovarian 
cancer s.  In adults, CD105 expression is limited to endothelial cells , monocytes  and 
proerythroblasts, a red blood cell precursor [25].   
CD105 expression is a prognostic factor in solid tumor patients .  High  microvessel density of 
CD105 -positive vessels has been correlated with poor prognosis in clinical studies of  breast 
cancer [26, 27], lung cancer  [28], prostate cancer  [29, 30], colorectal cancer [31, 32], ovarian 
cancer   [33, 34], gastric cancer [35], endometrial cancer [36], astrocytic brain tumors [37], 
hepatocellular carcinoma [38], esophageal adenocarcinoma [39], and head and neck cancer [40, 
41].   
Importantly, CD105 expression is upregulated in tumor endothelial cells  following inhibition of 
the VEGF pathway.  CD105 expression increased more than 2-fold in human pancreatic cancers 
grown in mice treated with an antibody that binds VEGF [42].  As well, treatment of human 
bladder cancers grown in mice with an antibody that blocks activation of the VEGF receptor 
increased CD105 expr ession within the core tumor vasculature , allowing continued tumor 
growth despite VEGF inhibition  [43].  Finally, inadequate expression of CD105, or conditional 
deletion in endothelium, resensitizes resistant tumors to VEGF inhibition [44]. 
3.3. TRC105 Background   
TRC105 is a genetically engineered human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody directed 
against human CD105  [45], a proliferation receptor found on the surface of normal and 
proliferating endothelial cells  [9, 14, 20].   
The antibody is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin containing murine variable region sequences 
and human constant region sequences  [45].  TRC105 has an approximate molecular weight of 
148 kDa. TRC105 has a binding avidity for human CD105 of approximat ely 5 pM. TRC105 is 
formulated as a 20 mM L -Histidine/L -Histidine M onohydrochloride, 240 mM Trehalose, 0.01% 
Polysorbate 20 Formulation (25 mg TRC105/mL)  
SN6j, t he mu rine parent antibody of TRC105, binds to human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
(HUVECs) w ith nea rly identical avidity as TRC105.   SN6j has been shown to bind  the tumor 
vasculature of malignant tissues including breast, colon, rectum, kidney and lung  cancers and to 
IND 1 00522                                                                           105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5

 inhibit the growth of tumor xenografts [15].  Reactivity with tumor tissues is restricted to the 
tumor endothelium, as CD105 is not generally expressed  on epithelial tumor cells [14].  TRC105 
induces  ADCC on proliferating HUVECs  at low conentrations and induces apoptosis and growth 
inhibition at higher concentrations .   
Studies at Duke University explored the in vitro  effects of dual angiogenesis inhibition using 
bevacizumab and TRC105 i n human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC ) [46]. 
Combination therapy was found to be more potent in decreasing HUVEC proliferation, 
migration, and tubular network formation than bevacizumab or TRC105 treatment alone.    
Furthermore, TRC105 induced apoptosis in HUVEC, while promoting SMAD2/3 
phosphorylation and inhibiting SMAD1/5/8 signaling, confirming i ts anti -angiogenic properties. 
Finally, antibody to mouse CD105 potentiates the activity of soraf enib, in mouse bearing cancer 
grafts [47]. For these reasons, CD105 blockade using TRC105 in combination with VEGF 
inhibition by sorafenib may provide greater clinical benefit than would be seen with either drug 
alone . 
3.3.1.  Phase 1 TRC105 Monotherapy Study Design for Solid Cancers  
Several studies with TRC105 are underway or have completed.  An open -label, phase  1, 
multicenter study of TRC105 (Study 105ST101 ) is complete .  Fifty  patients were treated  until 
disease progression with TRC105 at 0.01 -15 mg/kg /q2wk or 10 -15 mg/kg/wk.     
3.3.1.1.  Phase 1 TRC105 Monotherapy Pharmacokinetics  
In Study 105ST101, TRC105 pharmacokinetics were assessed on patients enrolled at doses up to 
15 mg/kg weekly.  Circulating TRC105 was n ot measurable above the lower limit of quantitation 
of the assay (78 ng/mL) in patients receiving doses below 0.3 mg/kg.  TRC105 was measurable 
above the target concentration based on preclinical data (200 ng/mL) for 4 hours at 0.3 mg/kg, 1 
day at 1 mg/kg,  5 days at 3 mg/kg, 7 days at 10 mg/kg TRC105 dosed every two weeks.  Serum 
concentrations expected to saturate CD105 binding sites (≥ 200 ng/mL) were achieved 
continuously at 15 mg/kg q2wk and 10 mg/kg weekly, and TRC105 accumulated at 15 mg/kg 
weekly ( Figure  1).

3.3.1.2.  Phase 1 TRC105 Monotherapy Immunogenicity  
In Study 105ST101, ser um samples for evaluation of TRC105 immunogenicity, including 
HAMA and HACA, were collected predose on day 1 of each 28 day cycle, at the end of study, 
and then at 4 and 12 weeks after the end of study visit.  
HAMA and HACA data are available from the phase  1 monotherapy TRC105 trial.  Neither 
HAMA nor HACA were detected in patients treated with  CHO -produced TRC105, which  will be 
used for this study .

 3.3.1.3.  Phase 1 TRC105 Monotherapy Safety  
A total of 50 patients were  treated on Study 105ST101 with escalating doses of TRC105 at 0.01, 
0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 15 mg/kg e very two weeks and then 10 and 15 mg/kg weekly.  Dose 
escalation proceeded stepwise until the top dose was reached.  The maximum tolerated dose was 
exceeded at 15 mg/kg weekly and the recommended phase 2 dose of TRC105 was therefore 
determined to be 10 mg/kg weekly  or 15 mg/kg every two weeks .  Three of 4 patients at 15 
mg/kg weekly developed grade 3 hypoproliferative anemia (without leucopenia or 
thrombocytopenia) in cycle 2, and one of the three progressed to grade 4 in cycle 3.  Anemia was 
associated with accumulation of TRC105 and characterized by a low reticulocyte production 
index.  Additional laboratory and clinical evaluations excluded common ca uses of anemia 
including blood loss, hemolysis, plasma volume expansion, inadequate erythropoietin, iron 
deficiency, and vitamin B -12 or folate deficiency.  The anemia is believed to result from 
TRC105 -mediated suppression of  proerythroblasts, the only ce lls in the bone marrow known to 
express substantial levels of C D105 [25].  Anemia was reversible and manageable with dose 
reduction and standard supportive measures including erythropoietin and blood transfusion.   
Infusion reactions, anemia, fatigue, epistaxis and headache were the most frequently observed 
adverse events considered related to TRC105.  The majority of treatment -related adverse events 
were grade 1 or 2.  
Infusion reactions, among the most common advers e events, were usually with the initial 
TRC105 dose and included one or more of the following signs or symptoms: rigors, 
bronchospasm, urticaria, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia .  A 
glucocorticoids -based premedication regimen and exte nded infusion time during  the initial 
infusion mitigated the frequency and severity of first dose infusion reactions .  At dose levels 
where continuous TRC105 serum levels were achieved  (e.g., 10 mg/kg weekly and 15 mg/kg 
every two weeks) , glucocorticoids  were safely discontinued and the infusion duration reduced to 
1 hour.  
Three patients developed grade 1 cutaneous telangiectasia on the trunk early in the course of 
therapy, all at dose levels of 10 or 15 mg/kg weekly that resu lted in continuous serum levels  of 
TRC105 known to saturate CD105 sites on human endothelium.  Grade 1 or 2 hemorrhage was 
reported, including intermittent postcoital vaginal bleeding (that also occurred prior to TRC105 
treatment), epistaxis, and superficial gingival bleeding.    
Grade 1 or 2 headaches were observed, mainly in patients treated at doses of TRC105 above 3 
mg/kg.  Headaches began the day following infusion and were generally manageable with 
acetaminophen.  However, grade 2 headache in one patient at 15 mg/kg weekly prompted  
discontinuation prior to completion of the dose -limiting toxicity evaluation period.  Fatigue was 
one of the more common adverse event s attributable to TRC105 and was more prevalent at doses 
above 3 mg/kg.   
One patient developed dose -limiting toxicity of  grade 4 hemorrhage presenting as melena from a 
gastric ulcer within 5 days of the initial TRC105 infusion at 0.1 mg/kg.  He discontinued 
TRC105 treatment, was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and the bleeding resolved

 (unless healing was documented) and patients on ulcerogenic medications including non -
steroidal an ti-inflammatory drugs.  
Classic toxicit ies associated with VEGF inhibition, including hypertension, proteinuria and 
thrombosis were not prominent.  One patient with recurrent anal cancer treated at 0.1 mg/kg 
developed proteinuria considered possibly relate d to TRC105, but proteinuria was also noted 
prior to TRC105 dosing.  Transient hypertension (156/112) without QT changes occurred in a 
single patient one day following infusion of 15 mg/kg, and was controlled by a single dose of 
oral antihypertensive medic ation. There were no arterial or venous thromboembolic events , nor 
gastrointestinal or other perforations in these patients.  
3.3.1.4.  Phase 1 TRC105 Monotherapy  Efficacy  
In study 105ST101 s table disease ≥ 2 months was observed in 2 1 of 45 patients (4 7%) and stable 
disease ≥ 4 months in 6 of 44 patients (14%).  Decreases in CEA, PSA, or CA -125 were noted in 
7 of 21 patients (3 3%) and a global decrease in key angiogenic biomarkers was observed with 
treatment.  One patient with castrate -refractory prostat e cancer remains  on TRC105 treatment  
after 7 years at a TRC105 dose of 0.01 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  He ha s an ongoing  complete PSA 
response, with resolution of bone pain and bone scan normalization. One uterine cancer patient 
remained on TRC105 treatment for  20 months with a  minor radiographic response.  TRC105 
treatment duration of the patient with carcinosarcoma of the uterus exceeded prior treatment 
duration with all prior therapies including a carboplatin/paclitaxel, anastrozole and ifosfamide.    
3.3.2.  Phase 1b Study of TRC105 with Bevacizumab  
3.3.2.1.  Summary of Safety  
A total of 38 patients were dosed on study across six cohorts and four dose levels. Other than 
headaches that were mitigated by adjusting the dosing schedule of TRC105, the combination of 
TRC105 and bevaci zumab was well tolerated  at the recommended phase 2 doses of the two 
drugs of 10 mg/kg each .  Two patients experienced grade 3 serious adverse suspected events as 
described below. Most adverse events were graded as 1 or 2 and Grade 4 and 5 suspected 
advers e events were not observed. Grade 3 suspected adverse reactions included anemia (the 
dose limiting toxicity of TRC105 established as a single agent; 9 patients), headache (4 patients; 
three of which occurred prior to adjusting the schedule of TRC105), fati gue (2 patients), brain 
abscess (1 patient), infusion reaction (in a patient dosed at 6 mg/kg), and decreased appetite (1 
patient). Headache was the most common suspected adverse event and occurred in 31 patients 
(86.1%); three patients (7.9%) experienced migraine headaches (two of grade 1 and one of grade 
2 severity). Headaches were treated with triptans and NSAIDs.  
Two patients experienced serious adverse suspected events as described below.  One of the grade 
3 headaches (in a patient dosed at 8 mg/kg wit hout splitting the initial TRC105 dose over two 
days) resulted in hospitalization and patient discontinuation.  One patient dosed at 10 mg/kg of 
TRC105 experienced a serious suspected event of grade 3 brain abscess.  Serious adverse events, 
considered unre lated to TRC105 treatment, included: grade 3 pneumonia and subsequent grade 4 
MRSA sepsis that was complicated by a non Q -wave myocardial infarction during a period of 
hemodynamic instability while hospitalized; grade 3 ileus at the time of symptomatic dis ease

 progression; grade 5 disease progression; grade 3 left foot cellulitis; grade 3 recurrent 
pneumothorax; grade 3 small bowel obstruction; grade 4 urosepsis.  
At least one sign of the triad of epistaxis, gingival bleeding and telangiectasia, reflecting v ascular 
ectasia characteristic of the Osler -Weber -Rendu syndrome of endoglin haplotype insufficiency 
(i.e., an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of heterozygous endoglin expression) was observed 
frequently.  One of these signs or symptoms (of grade 1 or 2 severity) was noted in one of three 
patients treated at 3 mg/kg, four of eight patients treated at 6 mg/kg, four of eight patients treated 
at 8 mg/kg and in all nineteen patients treated at 10 mg/kg of TRC105, generally within the first 
month of dosing.  These signs and symptoms are an expected pharmacologic effects of TRC105 
binding to the endoglin receptor (i.e., they are characteristic of the Osler -Weber -Rendu  
syndrome, that is caused by endoglin haploinsufficiency), and were also observed routinely 
within the first month of dosing of 10 mg/kg weekly in the single agent TRC105 dose escalation 
study.   
Infusion reactions were, as expected, more notable at lower doses, and were rare at the MTD of 
TRC105 of 10 mg/kg, when TRC105 serum concentrations were m aintained continuously.  Two 
of nineteen patients (10%) dosed with 10 mg/kg of TRC105 each experienced a single infusion 
reaction of grade 2 severity, both with the initial dose of TRC105, that required a brief 
interruption of the infusion prior to complet ion of the scheduled dose.  
Clinically significant anemia was not reported in patients dosed with 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg of 
TRC105, was reported in three of seven patients (43%; all grade 3) dosed with 8 mg/kg of 
TRC105, and was observed in nine of 19 (47%; thr ee of grade 2 and six of grade 3 severity) of 
patients dosed with 10 mg/kg of TRC105.  Anemia prompted transfusion of packed red blood 
cells in 10 patients and growth factors were used in five patients.  
Other, less frequent, suspected adverse reactions inc luded hypothyroidism, periorbital edema 
(which was generally noted prior to splitting the initial dose of TRC105), gingival pain, nausea, 
oral pain, vomiting, edema, decreased appetite, dyspnea, nasal congestion, rash and flushing.  
Other adverse events cha racteristic of each individual drug were not increased in frequency or 
severity when the two drugs were administered together.  Of note, the concurrent administration 
of bevacizumab and TRC105 did not potentiate the known toxicities of bevacizumab of 
hyper tension, hemorrhage (including tumor -associated hemorrhage, and pulmonary hemorrhage 
or hemoptysis), or proteinuria.  Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), 
congestive heart failure, fistulae, gastrointestinal perforation impaired wound healing, and 
arterial thromboembolic events, were not observed.  
Notably, hypertension and proteinuira, known adverse events of bevacizumab, were rarely 
observed when bevacizumab was given with TRC105.  Mild and transient clinically significant 
hypertension  or blood pressure increases were observed in five patients (13%; grade 3 in one 
case (prior to dosing with study drugs) and grade 2 in four cases) and mild transient proteinuria 
was observed in two patients (5%; both grade 2).  
3.3.2.2.  Summary of Efficacy  
The comb ination of TRC105 and bevacizumab was active in patients with advanced refractory 
cancer who had progressed on prior bevacizumab or other VEGF inhibitor treatment.  Thirty -
three patients had measurable disease (31 patients) or evaluable disease (2 patients ) at baseline

 and received at least one follow up scan and were evaluable for the primary efficacy outcome of 
ORR by RECIST 1.1.  Eighteen patients with measurable  disease (58%) had a best response of 
stable disease or partial response.  Two patients (6%),  both of whom had been treated with 
bevacizumab and chemotherapy prior to study entry and were then treated at the top dose level of 
TRC105 and bevacizumab, had RECIST 1.1 - defined partial responses, including one patient 
with colorectal cancer who continu es on treatment for more than  24 months.  A total of 14 
patients (45%) had decreases in overall tumor burden, of whom 10 received prior VEGF 
inhibitor treatment (usually bevacizumab with chemotherapy).  Notably, the duration of 
treatment with TRC105 and be vacizumab of six patients ( 20% of those with measurable  disease) 
exceeded the duration of treatment of the most recent treatment regimen containing a VEGF 
inhibitor (i.e., VEGFR TKI or bevacizumab), received prior to study entry.  These six patients 
had de creases in tumor burden and several were responders by Choi criteria or RECIST.  Time to 
progression ranged from 0 to 437+ days.  Reductions in tumor markers ranging from 5% to 85% 
were observed in 15 of 28 (54%) patients with relevant tumor markers.  Thre e patients 
demonstrated clinical benefit throughout the study, two of whom  continue d to receive treatmen t 
under a continuation protocol  for more than 1  year before coming off study . 
3.4. Phase 1b Trial of TRC105 and  Sorafenib  and other VEGFR TKI  
The NCI -sponsored Study 11 -C-0102 was  an open -label, non -randomized, dose -escalation, 
Phase  1b-2 study of TRC105 in combination with sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily  in patients 
with hepatocellular carcinoma  (Childs Pugh A/B7  and ECOG performance status  of 0 or 1 ).  
Standard eligibility criteria used in other TRC105 protocols were modified for the hepatocellular 
cancer population (including the inclusion of patients with thrombocytopenia), reflecting the 
frequent comorbidity of cirrhosis existent in this  population.  Twenty  patients were enrolled in 
the Phase 1b stage , consisting of 3 patients at 3  mg/kg, 3 at 6 mg/kg, 6  at 10 mg/kg, and 8 at 15 
mg/kg TRC105 every 2 weeks in combination with sorafenib  (the MTD) .  Of the planned 
enrollment of up to 45 pati ents in the Phase 2 stage , 7 patients enrolled, at 15 mg/kg TRC105 
every 2 weeks in combination with sorafenib.  A total of 27 patients enrolled,  this study is now 
complete .  In general, the combination of TRC105 and sorafenib appears to be well tolerated 
with encouraging signs of activity in this study.    
The only death in this study, myocardial infarction, was assessed as a suspected reaction to 
TRC105.  This was a 60 -year-old man with significant coronary artery disease was receiving 
TRC105 10 mg/kg ever y 2 weeks (last dose 10 days prior to the event) and sorafenib 400 mg p.o. 
daily (last dose 3 days prior to the event).  During his second month of treatment he felt poorly 
and underwent cardiac catheterization, where he was found to “have a 90% heart bloc kage and 
expired of a myocardial infarction.”  A total of 18 patients contributed a total of 25 SAEs in this 
study, of which 10 were assessed as suspected reactions to TRC105:  Grade 5 Myocardial 
infarction; Grade 3 AST increased and Cerebrovascular accide nt; Grade 3 Hepatic failure; and 
Grade 2 Epistaxis, Flushing, Haemorrhage intracranial, Hypotension , Infusion -related reaction, 
and Pancreatitis.   
A total of 7 patients were withdrawn from study due to 8 AEs, of which 2 were assessed as 
suspected reaction s to TRC105:  Grade 3 Hepatic failure and Grade 1 Epistaxis.  Unrelated AEs 
that led to withdrawal were Grade 4 Sepsis; Grade 3 Blood bilirubin increased, Mucositis oral, 
and Rash maculo -papular; and Grade 1 Abdominal distension and Pain.   
IND 1 00522                                                                           105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5

Page 31 of 106 
 The majority of AEs were mild (Grade  1) or moderate (Grade  2) in severity.  None of the 4 
Grade  4 AEs were assessed as suspected reactions to TRC105.  The only Grade  3 AEs assessed 
as suspected reactions to TRC105 were 1 event each of Grade 3 AST increased , Cerebrovascular 
accident, and Hepatic failure.   
The most common AEs suspe cted to be reactions to TRC105 were Headache (63%); AST 
increased (59%); Blood bilirubin increased (55%); Anaemia (52%); Fatigue and Nausea (44%), 
Lymphocyte count decreased (41%);  Hypoalbuminaemia and Blood alkaline phospha tase 
increased (37%); Infusion -related reaction (33%); and Platelet count decreased (26%).  All of 
other related AEs occurred at an incidence ≤  19%.  
The most common AEs regardless of relat edness to TRC105 treatm ent were Hypophosphataemia 
(81%); Anaemia (78%); Hypoalbuminaemia (74%); AST increased and Pain (67%); Epistaxis, 
Headache, Lymphocyte count decreased, B lood bilirubin increased, Blood alkaline phosphatase 
increased, and Fatigue (each 63%); ALT increased ( 59%); Rash maculo -papular (52%); 
Hyponatraemia, Nausea, and Diarrhoea (each 48%); and Blood amylase increased and Activated 
partial thromboplastin time prolonged (each 44%).   All other AEs occurred at an incidence 
≤ 37%.   
Five of 15  (33%) evaluable patie nts in Phase  1b treated at the top dose levels of 10 mg/kg or 
15 mg/kg of TRC105 given every 2 weeks with sorafenib  achieved partial responses by RECIST.   
Four additional patients had confirmed stable disease, 1 of whom was treated for 22 months.  
Median t ime on study was 4 months (range 2 to 22 months).  The NCI concluded that TRC105 
combined with sorafenib was well tolerated at the recommended doses of both drugs  and 
demonstrated evidence  of activity  beyond the expected sorafenib response rate of 2-3% reported 
in its two pivotal  Phase 3 studies .   
3.5. Study Rationale  
Given the novel mechanism of action and safety profile in early phase clinical studies, TRC105 
is a logical therapy to use with sorafenib  in HCC.  This is a phase 2,  open label study of TRC105 
plus sorafenib including a lead-in phase 1 b dose escalation study of sorafenib in combination 
with TRC105 .  The phase 1b portion is a standard “3+3” dose -escalation design of patients with 
unresectable HCC to  assess the safety a nd tolerability of the recommended phase 2 dose (RPTD) 
and schedule of TRC105  given by i.v. infusion .  The purpose of the dose escalation portion is to 
determine the maximum tolerated do se (MTD) of TRC105 with sorafenib  and determine dose 
limiting toxiciti es.   
The starting dose and schedule of TRC105 ( 10 mg/kg weekly in cycle 1, and 15 mg/kg every two 
weeks  in cycle 2+ ) were selected based on safety, pharmacokinetics and early evidence of 
activity in a phase 1 b/2 study of TRC105 in combination with sorafen ib in patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma  (NCI Study 11-C-0102 ), and p hase 1b stud ies of TRC105 with axitinib  
(105RC101)  and pazopanib  (105SAR101) .  NCI Study 11 -C-0102 dosed TRC105 at 15 mg/kg 
every two weeks, starting on cycle 1 day1 , with sorafenib .  While the dose was tolerable when 
given with sorafenib , patients who did not achieve continuous TRC105 serum concentrations 
developed infusion reactions upon redosing or required chronic  steroid premedication to prevent 
infusion reactions (i.e., patients without continuous TRC105 serum levels developed infusion 
IND 1 00522                                                                           105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5

 reaction s upon repeat dosing when TRC105 b ound  de novo  to its target on the tumor 
endothe lium and engaged  ADCC).   
Weekly TRC105 dosing at 10 mg/kg is the recommended Phase 2 schedule , and has been 
administe red to more than 350 cancer patients  including patients enrolling  in the Phase 3 pivotal 
study in angiosarcoma that is proceeding following Special Protocol Assessment by the FDA . 
However, TRC105 administration weekly for four weeks  followed by every other week 
thereafter  has also been studied to improve patient convenience.  This TRC105 administration 
schedule was evaluated in combination with axitinib  and pazopanib  in separate P hase 1b studies.  
In each case, continuous TRC105 serum levels were achieved in all patients and recurrent 
infusion reactions were not observed  when TRC105 was administered every other week.  
TRC105 was also tolerable when given at a dose of 10 mg/kg weekly  for four doses  in the phase 
1 portion of this study  without dose limiting toxicity . However, one patient developed a serious 
adverse event of Grade 3 infusion related reaction when dosed with 15 mg/kg every other week  
starting in cycle 2.  PK analyse s ind icated that target TRC105 serum concentrations  were 
achieved with weekly dosing but were below target concentrations, and were in some cases 
undetectable, following every other week dosing ; this observation may reflect increased 
clearance of TRC105 in pati ents with HCC compare d to other tumor types  due to the vascular 
nature of the disease .  Therefore, following recommendation of the principal investigators , 
weekly dosing at 10 mg/kg was chosen as the recommended  Phase 2 dose  for this study .  
Ongoing patien ts in the Phase 1b portion of this study may, at the discretion of the investigator, 
be treated at the Phase 2 TRC105 dose of 10 mg/kg weekly  to achieve optimal target 
concentrations .       
Secondary  endpoints will be overall response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS) , 
safety, APA, TRC105 and sorafenib PK and correlative studies of plasma angiogenic 
biomarkers .  Following completion of the phase 1b portion, the recommended phase 2  dose was 
determined by principal investigators to be 10 mg/kg TRC105 weekly in  combination with 400 
mg sorafenib twice  daily . The phase 2 portion is a multicenter, open label , phase 2 study of 
TRC105 in combination with standard dose sorafenib  in patients with unresectable HCC. The 
primary endpoint of the phase 2 portion is ORR.  S econdary endpoints will evaluate PFS, safety, 
APA, TRC105 and sorafenib PK and correlative studies of plasma angiogenic biomarkers . 
Achievement of the primary and secondary endpoints of this Phase  1/2 trial will justify the 
initiation of a randomized Phase 3 trial of sorafenib +/ - TRC105.

 Common (≥ ~10%) TRC105 possibly related adverse events across all studies were headache, 
epistaxis, fatigue, anemia, nausea, infusion related reaction, gingival bleeding, flushing, 
vomiting, hypertension, decreased appetite, telangiectasia, and dia rrhea.  
Grade 1 and 2 mucocutaneous telangiectasia related to TRC105 occur early in the course of 
therapy and have been the source of gingival bleeding and epistaxis.  
Grade 1 and 2 periodontal disease reported under various terms including gingival pain, gi ngival 
disorder, gingival swelling and gingival infection was reported in approximately 8% of patients.  
Grade 3 anemia has occurred with TRC105 therapy at the recommended phase 2 dose.  All 
patients treated with TRC105 should be monitored closely for anemi a and treated appropriately, 
including the possibility of TRC105 dose interruption and/or reduction.  The anemia related to 
TRC105 is hypoproductive in nature and is reversible with interruption of treatment, transfusion, 
erythropoietin, and other interven tions as appropriate. Anemia may also be related to blood loss 
from epistaxis or gingival bleeding that result from mucocutaneous telangiectasia.  
Infusion reactions have been observed following TRC105 administration may include one or 
more of the following  signs or symptoms: rigors, flushing, bronchospasm, urticaria, fever, rash, 
dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, change in blood pressure, and change in heart rate.  Infusion 
reactions generally occur with the initial infusion in patients dosed at recommended phase 2 
doses of 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg every two weeks, and are typically of grade 1 or 2 severity 
following dosing with premedication that includes glucocorticoids.  All patients treated with 
TRC105 should receive appropriate premedication as defined in this pro tocol, be monitored 
during the TRC105 infusion, and be treated appropriately for infusion reactions (including 
possible TRC105 dose interruption). Hypersensitivity reactions with infusions are a potential risk 
for sensitized patients, and TRC105 should be avoided or used with caution in patients with 
known hypersensitivity to any component of the drug product.   
Pneumothorax has been observed in trials of TRC105 administered with pazopanib in patients 
with lung metastases. Pneumothorax is an expected advers e event associated with the use of 
pazopanib, particularly in sarcoma patients with lung metastases. However, pneumothorax was 
observed in one patient, also with lung metastases, receiving single -agent TRC105 . 
Sorafenib  
The most common adverse reactions (≥  20%), which were considered to be related to sorafenib , 
in patients with  HCC or RCC are fatigue, weight loss, rash/desquamation,  hand -foot skin 
reaction, alopecia, diarrhea, anorexia,  nausea and abdominal pain.  
Further details are available in the package insert .  
Computed Tomography (CT) Scans  
Patients will be exposed to a small amount of radiation as a result of the CT scans required in 
this study.  This degree of exposure has not been associated with harmful health effects. In 
addition, the frequ ency of CT scans performed in this study is similar to the standard of care 
frequency.  Patients with a medical contraindication to CT scans or known Iodinated contrast 
allergies may undergo MRI.   There is minimal risk of  MRI imaging in patients able to und ergo

 this type of exam including very rare reports  of gadolinium -induce nephrogenic systemic fibrosis 
in patients with poor renal function   
Venipuncture  
Patients could also experience side effects from venipuncture for tests that will be done as part of 
this study including pain, tenderness or bruising at the site of collection, and rarely infection may 
occur at the spot where the needle is inserted.  
Other Risks  
This study treatment may involve risks to unborn child ren therefore  patients should not become 
pregnant or father a baby while participating in this study.  Patients should not nurse while on 
this study.  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before taking 
part in this study.  Patients will be asked to practice an effect ive method of birth control during 
participation in this study and for 180 days after the last treatment.  Wom en must be of non -child 
bearing potential due to surgical sterilization (at least 6 weeks following surgical bilateral 
oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or tubal ligation) confirmed by medical history or 
menopause ; or must agree to use two methods of effective and highly reliable methods of 
contraception  at the same time [i.e., tubal sterilization (tubes tied), partner’s vasectomy, int ra-
uterine device (IUD), male latex con dom with or without spermicide, diaphragm with 
spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, vaginal sponge (contains spermicide)] during study 
treatment (including during temporary breaks from treatment), and for at leas t 180 day s after 
stopping TRC105 or sorafe nib.  Men must agree to use two effective and highly reliable methods 
of contraception at the same time [i.e., vasectomy, male latex condom with or without 
spermicide, partner’s tubal sterilization (tubes tied) , partner’s use of intra-uterine device (IUD) , 
partner’s use of diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, vaginal sponge 
(contains spermicide)] during study treatment (including during temporary breaks from 
treatment), and for at least 180 days after stopping TRC105 or sorafe nib. The long term risk of 
infertility is unknown.   Ovarian failure has been observed with other antiangiogenic agents.

 5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
5.1.1.  Overview  
All patients must sign a consent form prior to undertaking any study -related procedures.  
Prospective patients will be screened to determine if they qualify for the study within 28 days of 
enrollment.  Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Versio n 4.03.   
5.1.1.1.  Phase 1b Overview  
This is a multicenter, open -label, nonrandomized, phase 1b, dose -finding study of TRC105 in 
combination with standard dose sorafenib  in patients with unresectable HCC .  Escalating doses 
of i.v. TRC105 will be administered weekly  or every two weeks beginning with Dose Level 1 in 
combination with  oral sorafenib  given as 400 mg  p.o. b.i.d. daily .  Sorafenib dose modifications 
are allowed starting in cycle 1 as per the package insert and Section  7.8.6 . Intermediate dose  
TRC105 (below the MTD established during the trial) may be explored based upon clinical, PK, 
and/or biomarker data.  
TRC105 d osing will begin at 10 mg/kg  weekly in cycle 1 and 15 mg/kg  every two weeks  
beginning with cycle 2 (Dose Level 1) however a -1 Dose Level has also been included ( 10 
mg/kg  weekly  in cycle 1 and 10 mg/kg every two weeks beginning with Cycle 2 ) and will be 
enrolled if  Dose Level 1  excee ds the MTD . Upon agreement of the study investigators, a given 
TRC105 dose level may be reenrolled at 400 mg daily or 400 mg every other day of sorafenib 
and/or the first dose of TRC105 may be delayed by one week (i.e., delayed to cycle 1 day 8).   
Addition al patients may be enrolled at Dose Level 1 or -1 (as long as it does not exceed the 
MTD) to obtain additional safety and PK information . 
The first TRC105 dose  will be split into two doses whereby 3 mg/kg is administered on cycle 1 
day 1 and the balance (7 mg/kg) is administered on cycle 1 day 4.  The entire dose of TRC105  
(10 mg/kg)  is then  given  weekly  in cycle 1  and 10 mg/kg or  15 mg/kg  every two weeks 
thereafter  in cycle 2 and beyond  (depending on Dose Level) in combination with o ral sorafenib  
given as 400 mg p.o. b.i.d . Those who tolerate TRC105 without any infusion reactions may be 
eligible for reduced infusion durations and decreased premedication (see Section  7.7).  Patients 
who demonstrate a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) may 
continue on study until progression. Patients who cannot tolerate sorafenib  therapy and are 
thought to benefit from continued TRC105 therapy may continue on study on TRC105 alone.  
Patients who exit the study for reasons other than drug -related dose -limiting toxicity prior to 
completion of the DLT assessment period (first 56 -days)  will be replaced.  Intrapatient dose 
escalation of TRC105 is not allowed.

bTRC105 will be administered weekly during cycle 1. The first weekly TRC105 dose will be split into two doses 
whereby 3 mg/kg is administered on cycle 1 day 1 and the balance is administered on cycle 1 day 4. Starting on 
cycle 2 day 1 and beyond, TRC105 wil l be administered every two weeks on days 1 and 15.  
Three  patient s will be initially enrolled and treated  at Dose Level 1. If none of these 3 patient s 
experiences a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) during the 56-day evaluation period  (cycle 1 through 
the end of cycle 2 ) a total of six patients will be treated at this dose level . 
If 1 of 3 patient s experiences DLT, the dose level  will be expanded to 6 patient s.  The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded if ≥ 33% of patient s experience DLT at a given 
dose level .  DLT will have occurred when a patient has 1 or more toxicity listed in the table 
below that is at least possibly related  to TR C105 during the first 56 days (cycle 1  and 2 ).  
Patient s who exit the study for re asons other than DLT prior to completion of the 56-day DLT  
evaluation period will be replaced  to ensure an adequate safety assessment in each cohort .  
Patients who experience DLT and those without DLT who receive less than the prescribed dose 
of sorafenib  due to documented toxicity in Cycle 1  or 2 will be considered evaluable for dose 
escalation purposes.   Upon agreement of the study investigators, a given TRC105 dose level may 
be reenrolled at  400 mg daily or 400 mg every other day of  sorafenib  and/or the first dose of 
TRC105 may be delayed by one week (i .e., delayed to cycle 1 day 8).

is 28 days in duration.  
2. Cycle 1 day 1 : Hematology (including iron studies), blood chemistry (including TSH testing), ur inalysis, physical examination, ECG and 
pregnancy test not required if acceptable screening assessment is performed within 7 days prior to the start of treatment on cycle 1 day 1.  
3. End of Study : The end of study visit should generally occur within 14 days (+/- 1 day) of the last dose of TRC105. Assessments other than 
pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and protein biomarkers do not need to be repeated if performed within the previous 2 weeks ( previous 8 
weeks for radiologic tumor assessments). Follow -up visits  should occur 28 days following the last dose of TRC105 study drug as outlined in 
the Schedule of Assessments.  
4. Informed Consent : Must be obtained prior to undergoing any study specific procedure and may occur prior to the 28 -day screening period.  
5. Medical and Oncologic  History, Demographics and Baseline Signs and Symptoms: All information related to prior anticancer treatment 
should be recorded. Significant medical history and baseline signs and symptoms should be captured from the date of informed consent.   
6. Physical Examination : Examination of major body systems and ECOG performance status.  
7. Vital Signs : Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, weight. Assessment of vital signs during TRC105 Infusions: Vital  signs 
are to be assessed pre -infusion (i.e., within 30 minutes of starting the infusion) every 30 minutes during the infusion (+/ - 15 minutes) and at the 
end of the infusion (i.e. within 30 minutes after completing the infusion). Vital signs should be monitored more frequently a nd/or be yond the 
completion of the infusion if medically indicated (e.g. if the patient experiences an infusion reaction that has not yet reso lved).   
8. Hematology, Chemistry & Coagulation :  Testing to be performed locally.  Thyroid stimulating hormone to be tested at screening, day 1 of 
each cycle and at the end of study visit.  Cycle 1 day 1 assessments only need to be performed if screening assessments were performed more 
than 7 days prior to cycle 1 day 1.  Iron studies (FE) to be performed according to the sched ule of assessments and as clinically indicated 
during the study.  Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to be performed according to the schedule of assessments and as clinical ly indicated

(pre-dose). If the patient develops an arrhythmia, the ECG s hould be repeated on day 1 of each subsequent cycle. For a QTc >500 ms, a repeat 
ECG for confirmation and evaluation of the ECG by a cardiologist is recommended.   Additional ECGs may be performed on study as 
clinically indicated.  
15. Concomitant Medications and Treatments : Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of 
study treatment and up to 28 days following the last dose of study treatment. Required TRC105 premedications should be record ed on 
TRC105 premedicati ons CRF.  
16. Adverse Events : Patients must be followed for adverse events from the first day of treatment with sorafenib or TRC105 until at least 28 days  
after the last dose of study treatment, or until all serious or TRC105 related toxicities have resolved or  are determined to be “chronic” or  
“stable”, whichever is later. Baseline signs and symptoms will be recorded on corresponding case report forms. Any serious AE  that is  
possibly related to TRC105 occurring from the time of first dose or at any point after the reporting period must be promptly reported to  
TRACON.  
17. Overall Survival: Phone call to patient every two months to determine overall survival.     
18. TRC105 and Sorafenib Pharmacokinetics Pre -Dose (Trough) Concentration : One 5 mL blood sample and one 4 mL sample to be 
collected at the time -points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments, prior to dosing with sorafenib and prior to starting the TRC105 infusion. 
Samples will  be stored at approximately -70°C .  Samples will be  batch shipped as indicated in the laboratory manual to a third -party 
laboratory.  See separate laboratory guide for further collection and shipment information.  Additional PK samples may also b e collected at the 
time of unexpected clinical events.  
19.  Anti -product antibodies : 5 mL blood sample will be collected to assess anti -product antibodies at the time -points indicated in the schedule of      
assessments and stored at approximately -70°C to be analysed by a central laboratory. Samples will be batch shipped as indicated in the 
laboratory manual to a third -party laboratory. See separate laboratory guide for further collection and shipment information. Additional anti -
product antibody samples may also be collected at the time of unexpected clinical even ts. 
20. Protein Biomarkers : One 10 mL purple top (K3EDTA) tube will be collected at the time -points indicated in the schedule of assessments and 
stored at approximately -70°C to be analysed by a central laboratory. See separate laboratory guide for further  collection and shipment 
information.  
21. Tumor Marker: Blood sampling for tumor markers (i.e. AFP) will be collected and analyszed locally as indicated in the schedule of 
assessments.

be made to document patient outcome.  Data to be collected at the end of study visit are 
described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  5).  Patients will be followed for at least 28 
days after the last dose of TRC105 study drug  for adverse events.  If the patient withdraws 
consent,  no further evaluations should be performed, and no attempts should be made to collect 
additional data.  Patients may be withdrawn for DLT, but DLT does not mandate withdrawal if 
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5

    the DLT resolves and can be treated (i.e., a first dose infusion reaction).  Patients will be 
withdrawn from treatment in the case of:  
1. RECIST 1.1 -defined disease progression. In cases where RECIST cannot be applied, 
progression should be based on unequivocal evidence of progressive disease 
sufficient to require a change in therapy.  
2. A need for anticancer surgery, radiation, or for other anticancer therapy not specified 
in the protocol.  
3. Lost to follow -up or noncompliant.  
4. Any TRC105 dose delay > 2 days in cycle 1 (phase 1b only) unless discussed with 
sponsor.  
5. Pregnancy.  Pregnant pati ents should be followed for the duration of the pregnancy 
and the outcome of the pregnancy should be documented.  
6. Arterial thrombosis of any grade (including cerebrovascular ischemia, cardiac 
ischemia/infarction, or peripheral or visceral arterial ischemia) , grade 3 or 4 venous 
thrombosis (including pulmonary embolism), grade > 2 intracranial hemorrhage, 
grade 3 or 4 non -CNS hemorrhage. Grade 2 non -CNS hemorrhage does not mandate 
withdrawal if the underlying condition is treatable.  Grade 1 intracranial hemo rrhage 
does not mandate withdrawal and may be treated with dose interruption if the patient 
is benefitting from treatment.  
7. Missed study drug treatment for > 8 consecutive weeks (i.e., both TRC105 and 
sorafenib dosing held  concurrently ).  Patients who cann ot tolerate sorafenib and who 
demonstrate a response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable 
disease (SD) and are thought to benefit from continued single agent TRC105 therapy 
may continue on study on TRC105 alone.

    7. TREATMENT OF PATIENT S 
7.1. Description of TRC105 Study Drug  
TRC105 is a genetically engineered human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody directed 
against human CD105 found on the surface of proliferating endothelial cells.   
7.2. Composition of TRC105  
TRC105 is an IgG1, kappa immunoglobu lin contai ning murine light - and heavy -chain variable 
region sequences and human constant region sequences.  TRC105 has an approximate molecula r 
weight of 148 kDa.  
7.3. TRC105 Dose Level  
7.3.1.  Phase 1b  
Each patient will be dosed with 10 mg/kg weekly  during cycle 1 then, 10 mg/kg (Dose Level -1) 
or 15 mg/kg  (Dose Level 1)  every two weeks  thereafter of each 28 day cycle beginning with 
cycle 2  in the phase 1b portion  and 10 mg/kg weekly in Phase 2 . The maximum weight that  
should be used for purpose  of dose calculation is 85 kg for women and 100 kg for men.  Thus , 
the maximum dose that should be given to a woman at the 10 mg/kg dose is 850 mg  and at the 
15 mg/kg dose is 1275 mg .  The  maximum dose that should be given to a man at the 10 mg/kg 
dose is 1000 mg  and the 15 mg /kg dose is 1,500 mg .  TRC105 is distributed according to lean 
body mass rather than overall body weight.  Patients who are overweight would be at risk for 
high serum levels of TRC105 if the doses were not capped.  85 kg for women and 100 kg for 
men represent accepted maximum lean body masses for the two genders.  The calculated  dose of 
TRC105 can be rounded up or down to the nearest 1.0 mg;  in the case of an increment of 0.5 mg 
the dose should be rounded up.   The first TRC105 dose (cycle 1 day 1) will  be split into two 
doses whereby 3 mg/kg is admini stered on cycle 1 day 1 and the balance is administered on 
cycle 1 day 4  (i.e., 7 mg/kg) , in both Phase 1b and 2 .   Patients enrolled into the Phase 1b Dose 
Level -1 or Dose Level 1 will receive the entire dose of TRC105 (i.e. 10 or 15 mg/kg 
respectively ) starting on cycle 2 day 1 and every two weeks thereafter of each subsequent 28 day 
cycle .  
As outlined in Section  3.5 10 mg/kg of TRC105 weekly is the recommended phase 2 dose .  
Ongoing patients in the Phase 1b portion of this study may, at the discretion of the investigator, 
be treated at the Phase 2 TRC105 dose of 10 mg/kg we ekly.  
7.3.2.  Phase 2  
 Patients enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the trial will receive 10 mg/kg  weekly  (see 
Section  3.5 for dose selection rational) .   
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5

    7.4. TRC105 Packaging and Labeling  
TRC105 will be supplied at 25 mg/mL in 20 mM L -Histidine/L -Histidine Monohydrochloride,  
240 mM Trehalose, 0.01% Polysorbate 20 Fo rmulation in one or more of  the following 
presentations.  
200 mg TRC105/8  mL single -use vial  
400 mg TRC105/16  mL single -use vial   
7.5. TRC105 Storage and Shipping  
TRC105 must be stored between 2  °C and 8  °C (36  °F to 46  °F) and protected from light  
7.6. TRC105 Preparation  
TRC105 will be prepared in the pharmacy and diluted into normal saline using appropriate 
aseptic technique.  TRC105 will be administered using an in -line 0.2 micron filter.  No 
incompatibilities between TRC105 and polyvinyl chloride or polyolef in bags have been 
observed.  Multiple vials will be required for a single dose.  The following formulae should be 
used to calculate the volume of TRC105 to be added to normal saline:  
• Patient  weight (kg) × dose level (mg/kg ) divided by TRC105 concentration (mg/mL) = 
volume of TRC105 ( mL) to be administered.  
The volume of TRC105 that is to be administered can be rounded up or down to the nearest 1.0 
mL; in the case of an increment of 0.5 mL the volume  should be rounded up.   The maximum 
weight that should be u sed for dose calculation in this study is 85 kg for women and 100 kg 
for men (note: there is not a weight restriction for enrollment purposes).   If the patient’s 
weight changes by > 10% during the study, the dose of TRC105 will be recalculated.  At that 
time, a new baseline weight will be established such that subsequent weight changes by >10% 
from the new baseline weight would require further recalculation of the TRC105 dose.  The 
calculated volume of TRC105 will be diluted with normal saline.  Appropriate judgment should 
be exercised in withdrawing an adequate amount of saline necessary to permit injection of the 
appropriate volume of antibody into a normal saline bag in accordance with the dose needed.  
The final TRC105 concentration must be between 0. 6 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL.  The prepared 
TRC105 must be gently inverted several times in order to ensure a homogeneous solution.  The 
diluted infusion solution o f TRC105 should be used within 8  hours of preparation if stored at 
room temperature, or within 24 hours o f dilution if stored at 2° to 8°C (36º to 46ºF). The 
expiration time should be labeled on the bag.  If the diluted infusion solution of TRC105 cannot 
be infused within 8 hours  of preparation (i .e.: the prepared infusion is at room temperature for 
more than  8 hours) , a second bag will be prepared that contains the balance of the planned dose 
that was not already delivered.  The prepared solution should not be frozen.  
TRC105 should be diluted in ≤ 250 m L of normal saline in patients weighing less than 70 kg 
(this will prevent the administration of intravenous fluid in excess of 10% of blood volume 
during an infusion).

    7.7. TRC105 Administration  
Patients should be encouraged to drink abundant fluid (e.g., two eight -ounce  glasses of  water or  
juice) prior to the first treatment.  IV hydration prior to and during therapy is left to the discretion 
of the Investigator , but should be considered for patients that may be volume depleted . 
The following TRC105 premedications should be administered  and completed  2 hours to 30 
minutes  prior to the  start of each infusion  as described below :  
Phase 1b Dose Levels -1, 1 (10 mg/kg  weekly C1, and 10 or 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks  C2+) 
and Phase 2 (10 mg/kg weekly)  
• Acetaminophen 650 mg p.o. x 1  
• Famotidine 20 mg i.v.  or p.o.  (or similar H2 blocker) x 1 .  Famotidine or similar H2 
bloacker may be discontinued begining with cycle 2 in  the absence of an infusion 
reaftion with the previous dose  
• Cetirizine 10  mg i.v.  or p.o. x 1 (or similar oral or intravenous antihistamine) .  
Ceterizine or similar antihistamine may be discontinued begining with cycle 2 in the 
absence of an infusion reaftion with the previous dose.  
• Methylprednisolone  100 mg i.v. will be given prior to the Cycle 1 Day 1 , and Cycle 1 
Day 4  infusions. In addition, meth ylprednis olone will be given in the case of a delay 
of > 10 days between any weekly doses or > 17 days between any two TRC105 doses 
or if the patient develops  an infusion reaction > grade 2 during the immediate prior 
infusion .   
• Anti-emetic treatment, while not required, may be given prior to the initial dose and 
subsequent doses to reduce the frequency of nausea and vomiting that may be 
observed during TRC105 infusions . 
TRC105 premedication, including the methylprednisolone infusion , should be complete d 2 
hours to 30 minutes prior to initiating TRC105 infusions.   
TRC105 will be administered intravenously utilizing an infusion pump.  TRC105 has been 
demonstrated to be compatible with polyethylene lined, non -DEHP infusion sets and polyvinyl 
chloride, non -DEHP infusion sets.  TRC105 is required to be administered  with a 0.2 micro n 
downstream  filter.  The attachment of the infusion pump administration set to the i.v. bag and 
transport of the TRC105 study drug to the patient will be performed as per standard  study site 
procedures.   
Three mg/kg of TRC105 will be administered on cycle 1 day 1 and administered over 4 hours

7.7.1.  TRC105  Dose Reduction /Dose Delays  
TRC105 dose reductions and interruptions should be avoided in cycle 1  and 2 .  In cycle 3 and 
beyond, TRC105 d ose reduction s are allowed for grade 3 or 4 related adverse events  that resolve 
to ≤ grade 2 or baseline  (including anemia) .  Dose reductions for other toxicities are allowed at 
the discretion of the investigator.   Treatment dose delays cannot exceed 8 weeks (i.e., both 
TRC105 and sorafenib  dosing cannot both be held at the same time for > 8 consecutive weeks ). 
However, p atients who cannot tolerate sorafenib  and who demonstrate a response of complete 
response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with the combination  and are thought 
to benefit from continued single agent therapy m ay continue on study on TRC105 alone  per 
Section  6.2 of the protocol .

aAfter discussion with and agreement of the Sponsor, patients receiving TRC105 every two weeks have the 
option to return to weekly dosing at the lowest level (i.e., 4 mg/kg weekly), if 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks is not 
tolerable (i.e., 4th appearance of a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity attributable to TRC105 occurs) and the investigator 
believes that the patient is receiving benefit from the treatment.  
Patients with arterial thrombo sis or grade 3 or 4 venous thrombosis should be removed from 
study.  Patients with grade 1 or 2 venous thrombosis who require anticoagulation will have their 
TRC105 therapy interrupted.  TRC105 therapy may resume once the following criteria are met:

    • The patient is on a stable dose of heparin or low molecular weight heparin.  
• The patient has a platelet count > 60,000.  
• The patient has not had a hemorrhagic event of grade 2 or higher while on study.  
• The patient does not have a pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding 
(e.g., tumor involving major vessels).  
• The patient is benefiting from TRC105 therapy (no evidence of disease progression).  
TRC105 and  sorafenib  should be held for two weeks prior and for two weeks following surgical 
procedur es. However, resumption of study treatment can be shorter (but no less than 7 days) or 
longer than two weeks based on clinical judgement of adequate wound healing and recovery 
from the procedure.  For minor procedures  (e.g., port placement), TRC105 (and sor afenib) 
should be held for at least 1 week prior and for at least 1 week after (or until adequate healing).  
TRC105 DOSING DELAY:   If a patient misses a scheduled  weekly TRC105 dose  and dosing 
is resumed ≥ 10 days after the last dose or if a patient misses a scheduled every -2-week  dose and 
dosing is resumed ≥ 17 days after the last dose, premedication (including methylprednisolone) 
and TRC105 are  to be  administered as described in Table  10. Split dosing is not required.  
However, it is recommended that if the patient experienced a severe headache with a previous 
infusion,  the first TRC105 dose upon resumption should be administered over two days as was 
done for the initial dose , see Table  11.

7.7.2.  Management of TRC105 Infusion Reactions  
If a patient  experiences a  grade 2 or higher  adverse reaction during infusion, the infusion should 
be interrupted  and the patient  treated accordingly.  Antipyretic , antihistamine , antiemetic, anti -
inflammatory, or other symptomatic  medic ations  including epinephrine may  be administered as 
indicated.  For grade 2 and certain grade 3 infusion reactions, the infusion may be restarted at 
half of the previous rate if and when the infusion reaction has resolved , and then increased per 
patient to lerance to a maximum of 25 mg/min .  For grade 4 infusion reactions, the infusion 
should not be restarted and the patient should be discontinued from study treatment.  Infusion 
reactions will be recorded as AEs in the case report form.  Interventions should  be documented  
as concomitant medications or concomitant treatments as appropriate .

7.7.3.  TRC105 Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator  must maintain an accurate accounting of TRC105 supplied by TRACON .  
During the study, the following information mus t be recorded:  
• Date of receipt, quantity and lot number  of the TRC105 study drug received from 
TRACON  
• ID number of the patient  to whom the product is dispensed  
• The date(s) and quantity of the product dispensed  
• Dates and quantity of product returned, lost or accidentally or deliberately destroyed  
Investigational Drug Accountability Logs should be maintained by the site and must be readily 
available for inspection.  
7.7.4.  TRC105 Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
TRC105 must be stored upright between 2  °C and 8  °C (3 6 °F to 46  °F). The Investigator  should 
not return clinical study materials to TRACON  unless specifically instructed to do so by 
TRACON .  Used vials do not need to be maintained.  All expired vials of TRC105 should be 
retained  until destruction is authoriz ed by a TRACON representative.  The Site Pharmacist will 
be responsible for documenting the destruction (according to institutional requirements) of used 
or expired vials.

tablets each day).  Sorafenib tablets should be taken without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 
hours after a meal). Patients are to swallow the tablets whole with approximately 250 ml  (8 oz ) 
of water, each morning a nd evening (i.e., approximately 12 hours apart).  
7.8.6.  Sorafenib  Dose Modification  
Management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose 
reduction of sorafenib therapy. Dose reduction is allowed based on individual safety and 
tolerability starting in cycle 1  as outlined below and  in accordance with sorafenib package insert .  
Doses will be delayed or reduced for clinically significant hematologic and non -hematologic 
toxicities that are related to sorafenib according to the g uidelines that follow .   
Dose modifications wil l follow predefined dose levels in Table  13.  Dose adjustments for 
hematologic toxicity are based on blood counts obtained in preparation for the day of treatment.

Prevention/management strategies for diarrhea and fatigue  
Diarrhea and fatigue are common side effec ts of sorafenib.   The same dose -modification 
algorithm used for skin toxicities can be used to address these toxicities.   However, the 
preventive/management strategies for diarrhea and fatigue should be consistent with local 
standards (e.g., anti -diarrheal s and optimized hydration status for diarrhea).

Grade 0 (Preventive 
strategies)  • Maintain frequent contact with trial physician to ensure 
early diagnosis of HFSR.  
• Practical prevention strategies  
o Pedicurea for subjects with pre -existing hyperkeratosis.  
o Subjects should avoid hot water, and clothing or 
activities that can cause friction o n the skin.  
o Moisturizing cream should be applied sparingly.  
• Padded gloves and open shoes with padded soles should 
be worn to relieve pressure points.  
Grade 1  
Any occurrence  • Continue preventive strategies and in addition:  
o Soak hands in cool water.  
o Apply petroleum jelly to moist skin.  
• In the case of hyperkeratotic lesions, exfoliate the hands 
or feet and apply moisturizing cream immediately 
afterwards.  
Grade 2 Any occurrence or  
Grade 3 Any occurrence  • Continue supportive/management measures and add 
analges ic(s) for pain.  
aPedicure should be done by a podiatrist.  
Treatment -emergent hypertension  
Hypertension is a known and potentially serious adverse event  associated with sorafenib 
treatment. Subjects will check blood pressure at home, on a weekly basis through the first 4 
weeks of therapy.   Thereafter, blood pressure will be monitored at each clinic visit . Subjects with 
pre-existing hypertension will monit or blood pressure at home daily basis.  
Blood pressure measurements that are out of the normal range must be reported by the treating 
physician.   Blood pressure measurements considered out of the normal range are diastolic 
pressure > 90 mm Hg and/or systo lic pressure > 140 mm Hg, or a  20 mm Hg increase in diastolic 
pressure if the previous measurement was within normal limits.  
The dose -modification schedule to be followed in the event of treatment -emergent hypertension 
is outlined below.   The choice of anti-hypertensive medication to be used in cases of treatment -
emergent hypertension will be at the investigator's discretion and based on site -specific treatment 
guidelines as applicable.   All anti -hypertensive medications used for the management of 
treatm ent-emergent hypertension should be recorded in the subject’s records  and pertinent CRFs . 
Once a dose -reduction modification has been made for treatment -emergent hypertension, NO 
dose re -escalation will be allowed.

Grade 4  Discontinue sorafenib    
aSubjects requiring a delay of > 28 days should discontinue sorafenib unless, in the opinion of the treating 
physician, the subject may benefit from continued treatment.  
bSubjects requiring dose reductions beyond 400 mg once daily, every other day, should discontinue sorafenib.  
Sorafenib should be held for two weeks prior and for two weeks following surgical procedures.  
Patients who cannot tolerate sorafenib  therapy and who demonstrate a response of complete 
response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with the combination  and are thought 
to benefit from continued TRC105 therapy may continue on study on TRC 105 alone .  
7.8.7.  Sorafenib  Drug Accountability  
Patients will be asked to bring their sorafenib  prescription bottle  to the clinic at the beginning of 
each cycle for proper drug accountability  and destruction in accordance with institution 
guidelines .  A new pres cription will be dispensed at the beginning of each new cycle .  
7.9. Concomitant Medications  
No other approved or investigational anticancer treatment will be permitted during the study 
period .  No other investigational drug may be used during treatment on this  protocol, and 
concurrent participation in another clinical trial is not allowed.  
Patients who receive NSAIDs on study for more than three consecutive days should also receive 
peptic ulcer disease  (PUD ) prophylaxis with an H2 or proton pump blocker . 
Narcotic analgesics , nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, and triptans (e.g. sumatriptan)  may be 
offered as needed  for relief of pain or headaches .  Triptans are recommended for patients who 
experience a migraine headache following dosing, and may be taken  prior to the occurrence of

the treatment of sinus congestion.  
Packed red blood cell , colony stimulating factors,  and platelet transfusions should be 
admini stered as clinically indicated.   
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 inducers  is strongly discouraged and should be 
avoided  (Table  19) as they may decrease  sorafenib plasma concentrations . Patients may not have 
received a strong CYP3A4 inducer within 12 days prior to registration (see eligibility .

aBecause the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a comprehensive  list 
such as the one located at http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/  
Furthermore, patients taking narrow therapeutic index medications, (e.g. quinidine  or digoxin) 
should be monitored proactively.  
Sorafenib has the ability to inhibit a variety of liver metabolic enzymes in vitro. The clinical 
impact of this inhibition in humans taking drugs metabolized by these enzymes is unknown. 
Therefore, all patients enrolled onto this trial who are taking concomitant medications that are 
known to be metabolized by the liver should be closely observed for side effects of these 
concomitant medications.  
Patients with arterial thrombosis or grade 3 or 4 venous thrombosis should be removed from 
study.  Patients with grade 1 or 2 venous thrombos is who require anticoagulation will have their 
TRC105 therapy interrupted.  TRC105 therapy may resume once the following criteria are met:   
• The patient  is on a stable dose of heparin or  low molecular weight heparin  or Factor 
X inhibitor .  
• The patient h as a platelet count > 60,000.  
• The patient has not had a hemorrhagic event of grade 2 or higher while on study.  
• The patient does not have a pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding 
(e.g., tumor involving major vessels).  
• The patient is ben efiting from TRC105 therapy (no evidence of disease progression).

    8. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
8.1. Radiological Tumor Assessment  
The primary efficacy assessment for phase 1b is best overall response and progression free 
survival (defined as time from screening to either first disease progression or death from  any 
cause, patients alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last disease 
assessment) by RECIST 1.1. The primary efficacy assessment for phase 2 will be best overall 
response , including duration of response by RECIST 1.1 in as defined  in Section  8.1.2 .  The 
determination of antitumor efficacy will be based on objective tumor assessments made by the 
Investigator  according to  RECIST version 1.1 [48].  Investigator s will make treatment decis ions 
based on these assessments .  All lesions will be classified as target or non-target lesions  at the 
Screening visit.  Each lesion designation will be maintained through the course of the study.  
The same method and technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported 
lesion at Screening, during the study treatment period, and at the End of Study visit. Imaging -
based evaluation over clinical examination is the required technique when both could be used to 
assess the antitumor effect of the treatment.  Clinical Oncology review of all tumor 
measurements is desired.  
Whenever possible,  clinical evaluation of superficial lesions should not be used as the sole form 
of measurement.  However, when necessary, color photograph with metric caliper is acceptable.  
Tumor evaluation by positron emission tomography (PET) scan or by ultrasound may not 
substitute for CT or MRI scans.  
Radiological tumor assessments will be performed at screening, as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments  (Table  5), and whenever disease progression is suspected.  Another tumor 
assessment will be performed at the End of Study Visit if an assessment has not been performed 
within the prior 8 weeks.  All patient  files and radiological images must be available for CRF 
source verification. De-identified copies of MRI’s, in DICOM format, may be transferred to the 
Sponsor if requested  
8.1.1.  Measurability of Tumor Lesions  
At Screening, individual tumor lesions will be categ orized by the Investigator  as either target or 
non-target according to RECIST 1.1 as described below.  
• Measurable:  Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥  10 mm with spiral CT scan . Lytic bon e lesions, 
with an  identifiable soft tissue component , evaluated by CT or MRI, can be 
considered as measurable lesions  if the soft tissue component otherwise meets the 
definition of measurability previously described. Blastic bone lesions are non -
measurabl e.  Lesions in previously irradiated areas (or areas treated with local 
therapy) should not be selected as target lesions, unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion .  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when 
they are supe rficial (e.g. skin nodules, palpable lymph nodes)  and ≥ 10 mm .  Clinical 
lesions must be measured with calipers.  
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5  
5.3.3.2 Clinical Protocol                                                                                       15February2018  
______ ________________________________________________________________________  
 
 Page 72 of 106 
  
    • Non-Measurable:   All other lesions, including small lesions and bone lesions  other 
than lytic bone lesions , leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pl eural or pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis of the skin or lung, abdominal masses that are not confirmed 
and followed by imaging techniques, previously irradiated lesions  (unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion) , and disease document ed by indirect 
evidence only (e.g. by laboratory tests such as alkaline phosphatase).  
8.1.1.1.  Recording Tumor Measurements  
Measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions representative of all involved organs (with a 
maximum of 2 lesions per organ) should be iden tified as target lesions and measured and 
recorded at Screening and at the stipulated intervals during treatment.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameters) and their suitability for 
accurate repetitiv e measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).  Target lesions 
may include lymph nodes with a short axis > 15 mm.   
The longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion  (with the exception of lymph nodes, 
where the short axis will be u sed). The sum of the diameter for all target lesions at Screening will 
be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum diameter to be used as reference to further 
characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease during 
treatment.  All measurements should be performed using a caliper or ruler and should be 
recorded in metric notation in millimeters.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  M easurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as 
“present”, “ complete response ”, “non-CR/non -PD” or “ progressive disease ”. 
8.1.2.  Definitions of Tumor Response  
8.1.2.1.  Target Lesions  
• Complete response (CR)  is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions.  
• Partial response (PR)  is defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the dimensions of 
the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum dimensions.  
• Progressive disease (PD)  is defined as a ≥ 20% relative increase and ≥ 5 mm absolute 
increase in the sum of the dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the 
smallest sum of the dimensions recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 
one or more new les ions.  
• Stable disease (SD)  is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the 
dimensions since the treatment started.  
8.1.2.2.  Non-Target Lesions  
• Complete response (CR ) is defined as the disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
• non-CR/non -PD is defined as a persistence of ≥  1 non -target lesions.  
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5

 Page 73 of 106 
  
    • Progressive disease (PD)  is defined as unequivocal progression of existing non -target 
lesions, or the appearance of ≥ 1 new le sions.  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease  and progressive disease.  
8.1.2.3.  Determination of Overall Response  
8.1.2.4.  Determination of Overall Response by the RECIST Criteria  
When both target and non -target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded 
separately.  The overall assessment of respon se will involve all parameters as depicted in Table 
20 below.  Per RECIST 1.1, as this is a non-randomized trial with response is a primary endpoint, 
confirmation of PR or CR is required.   Per RECIST 1.1, a modest increase in the size of one or 
more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.

CR CR No CR 
CR non-CR/non -PD No PR 
CR Not evaluated  No PR

PD Any Response  Yes or No  PD 
Any Response  PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Response  Any Response  Yes PD 
aMeasurable lesions only.  
bMay include measurable lesions not followed as target lesions or non -measurable lesions.  
cMeasurable or nonmeasurable lesions.  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the tre atment started).  The patient ’s best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
NOTE:  Patient s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evi dence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“Need for additional anti -cancer therapy/surgery”.   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

    In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated by fine needle aspirate or biopsy before confirming the 
complete response status.

    9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
9.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be characterized in terms of the incidence, timing, severity (graded by the National 
Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], Version 
4.03), seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities.  In addition, 
physica l examination, vital signs, and ECOG performance status will be serially monitored.  
Laboratory safety analyses will be based on the local laboratory data, and  will include 
hematology, serum chemistry (including liver and kidney function), urinalysis , serum or urine 
pregnancy testing,  and coagulation profile. Serum will also be assessed for immunogenicity to 
TRC105 ( APA  titers).  In addition,  ECG will be perform ed at the time -points indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table  5) and as clinically indicated throughout the study . 
9.1.1.  Laboratory Safety Assessment s 
Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory tests should be recorded as adverse events.   To 
meet the definition of clinically significant, the test result generally requires a change in medical 
management (e.g. new medication, unplanned treatment, add itional tests, etc.).  
9.1.1.1.  Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation, Pregnancy Test  
Assessments will be performed at the time points  indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  
(Table  5) and analyzed at local laboratories.  Investigator s may have additional blood tests 
performed for the purpose of planning treatment administration, or for following adverse events 
as clinically indicated.  
• Hematology: CBC with differential and platelet count . Iron studies (serum iron, ferritin 
and total i ron binding capacity) . 
• Coagulation: Interna tional Normalized Ratio (INR) will be assessed  
• Serum Chemistry: Total bilirubin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase 
(AST), alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, total protein, albumin, sodium, pot assium, 
bicarbonate, chlo ride, calcium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, thyroid 
stimulating hormone and glucose  
• Pregnancy Test: Serum or urine pregnancy tests will be performed locally on all female 
patient s of childbearing potential . Patients  must be surgically sterile (i.e. , hysterectomy) 
or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use two methods of effective and highly reliable 
contraception  at the same time [i.e., tubal sterilization (tubes tied), partner’s vasectomy, 
intra-uterine device (IUD) , male latex condom with or without spermicide, diaphragm 
with spermicide, cervical cap with spermicide, vaginal sponge (contains spermicide)] 
during study treatment (including during temporary breaks from treatment), and for at 
least 180 days after stoppi ng TRC105 .

indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  5) and analyzed by local laboratories. 
Microscopic analysis  and/or urine protein -creatinine ratio (UPCR)  should be performed as 
clinically indicated.  
9.1.1.3.  Physical Examination  
A physical examination including, but not limited to, general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, 
throat, neck, heart, chest, abdomen, musculoskeletal, extremities, skin, lymph nodes, 
neurological genitourinary (as appropriate), and rectal (as appropriate)  will be assessed at time 
points  indicated within the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  5).  The physical examination will 
include examination of known and  suspected sites of disease.   
9.1.1.4.  Vital Signs   
Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate and weight will be assessed at time 
points  indicated within the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  5). Heart rate, temperature, blood 
pressure, and respiratory rate will also be assessed during TRC105 infusions as described in 
Section 5.1.2.2  and the footnotes of the  Table  5.  
9.1.1.5.  Performance Status   
The ECOG scale will be used to assess performance status at Screening.  
9.1.1.6.  ECG   
A single 12 -lead (with a 10 –second rhythm strip) tracing will be used for all ECGs.  It is 
preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate standard intervals automatically. 
ECG will be performed at the time -points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  5) 
and as clinically indicated throughout the study  
9.2. Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of suspected causal relationship to study drug will be 
reported as described below.   Medications administered and a ll other actions taken to treat the 
event, the outcome, and any recurrence upon re -challenge will be captured.  
9.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial patient  who is administered a 
drug or biologic (medicinal product); the event may or may not have a causal relationship with 
the medicinal product.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to the following:  
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs including :  
o Signs and symptoms resulting from drug overdose, abuse, misuse, withdrawal, 
sensitivity, dependency, interaction or toxicity.

    o All possibly related and unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a 
preexisting illness.  
o Injury or accidents.  Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the 
injury or accident (hip fracture from a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical 
condition (dizziness) and the outcome of the accident (hip fracture  from a fall ) 
should be reported as 2 separate adve rse events.   
o Symptoms or signs resulting from exposure in utero . 
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat confirmatory test).  
• Laboratory a bnormalities that meet any of the following (Note: merely repeating an 
abnormal test, in the absence of any of the below conditions, doe s not constitu te an AE.  
Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE.): 
o Test result that is associated with accompanying symptoms  
o Test result that requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical 
intervention  
o Test result that leads to a change in study drug  dosing outside of protocol -
stipulated dose adjustments or  discontinuation from the trial, significant additional 
concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy  
o Test result that is considered to be an AE by the Investigator  or TRACON  
9.2.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria/outc omes is classified as serious:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening ( i.e., at immediate risk of death)  
• Requires in  patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in co ngenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient  or may requi re medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependence 
or drug abuse.  
• Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury as assessed by laboratory test values 
(“Hy’s Law Cases”) are also reportable  as an SAE .  If a Study subject develops

    abnormal values  (3 x ULN) in aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase 
or both, concurrent with abnormal elevations  (2 x ULN) in total bilirubin  and no other 
known cause of liver injury, that event would be classified as a Hy’s Law Case  and an 
SAE .  
Serious also includes any other ev ent that the Investigator  or sponsor  judges to be serious, or 
which is defined as serious by the human rights act  in the country in which the event occurred.   
Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of progression) 
should n ot be reported as SAE s unless the outcome is fatal during the trial or within the safety 
reporting period.  Hospitalizations due to signs and symptoms of disease progression should not 
be reported as SAE s.  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the trial or within the safety 
reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as a n SAE  with NCI CTC 
grade  5.  
The onset date of an SAE is defined as the date on which the event initially met serious criteria 
(e.g., the date of admission to  a hospital).  The end date is the date on which the event no longer 
met serious criteria (e.g., the date the patient  was discharged from a hospital).  
9.2.2.1.  Hospitalization  
AEs associated with in -patient  hospitalization , or prolongation of an existing hospitalization , are 
considered serious.  Any initial admission, even if the duration is less than 24 hours is considered 
serious.  In addition, any transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit is considered 
serious (e.g. , transfer from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor  or transfer from a medical 
floor to a coronary care unit). However, t he following situations should not  be considered on 
their own to constitute a serious  AE:  
• Rehabilitation facility adm ission  
• Hospice facility admission  
• Respite care  
• Skilled nursing facility admission  
• Nursing home admission  
• Emergency room visit 
• Outpatient s ame day surgery /procedure  
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of precipitating clinical 
adverse events as follows:  
o Admission for treatment of preexisting condition not associated with  the 
development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting 
condition  
o Social admission  
o Administrative admission (e.g. for yearly physical exa m) 
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5  
5.3.3.2 Clinical Protocol                                                                                       15February2018

    o Protocol -specified admission during a clinical trial  
o Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical adverse event (e.g. 
for elective cosmetic surgery)  
o Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures  that are not related to an SAE  
o Hospitali zation for observation without an AE  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures , such as surgery, should 
not be reported as adverse events.  The medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should  be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event (e.g. acute 
appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
an adverse event and the appendectomy should be recorded as a concomitant procedure ). 
9.3. Reporting Adverse Events  
9.3.1.  Eliciting Adv erse Event Information  
The Investigator  is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the 
trial patient  using concise medical terminology.  In addition, each trial patient  will be questioned 
about AEs at each clinic visit fol lowing initiation of treatment.  The question asked will be, 
“Since your last clinic visit have you had any health problems?”  
9.3.2.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Safety information for each patient will be collected from the date of informed consent.  AEs 
occur ring prior to the initiation of the study treatment will be considered "baseline -signs and 
symptoms ” and will be recorded on corresponding case report forms  (CRFs) and will not be 
retained for patien ts who fail screening . The AE reporting period for this t rial begins when the 
patient has taken the first dose of sorafenib  or TRC105 study drug and ends 28 days after the last 
dose of  sorafenib o r TRC105 study drug is administered.   
All AEs that occur in trial patient s during the AE reporting period specified in the protocol must 
be reported to TRACON , whether or not the event is considered study treatment -related .  In 
addition, any known untoward event that occurs beyond the AE reporting period that the 
Investigator  assesses as poss ibly related to the investigational medication/product should also be 
reported as an AE. 
9.3.3.  Reporting Requirements  
Each AE is to be classified by the Investigator  as SERIOUS or NONSERIOUS  (Section 9.2.2 for 
SAE  definition) .  This classification of the event d etermines the reporting procedures to be 
followed.  If a n SAE  occurs, reporting will follow local and international regulations, as 
appropriate.  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any AE that meets one of the criteria for an SAE 
immediately upon l earning of the event.   Any subsequent revisions that are made to information 
pertaining to SAEs  (e.g., change in seriousness criteria, relationship to study drug, etc.) should be 
communicated to TRACON immediately.   This notification should be made to:  
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5

Following notification, the Investigator will report the SAE via the AE CRF via the data 
management system.   The initial AE CRF is to be updated with followed more detailed AE 
information within 5 calendar days of the event.  
In the rare event that the Investigator is not immediately  aware of a n SAE  (for example , if the 
study subject  seeks urgent medical attention  elsewhere ), the Investigator  is to notify the Sponsor 
immediately upon learning of it  and document his/her first awareness.  
Each SAE should be followed until resolution, or until such time as the Investigator de termines 
its cause or determines that it has become stable.  Information pertaining to follow -up of SAEs 
should also be sent to the TRACON Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
SAEs  that are unexpected and associated with use of the study medication will be reported to the  
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and all participating clinical sites by TRACON via 
MedWatch  or CIOMS forms.  For AEs that are fatal or life -threatening, unexpected, and 
associated with use of the investigational product, a 7 -Day Alert Report will be  submitted to the 
FDA within 7 calendar days of receipt of the SAE information.  For all other AEs that are 
serious, unexpected, and associated with use of the investigational product, a written report will

 Page 81 of 106 
  
    be made no more than 15 calendar days from the da te TRACON learns of the event. 
Participating clinical sites will be notified of these event s in parallel.  
All AEs, including SAEs,  are to be reported on the AE CRFs.  
9.3.4.  Recording Adverse Events in the Case Report Forms  
The Investigator  is to report all direc tly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the 
trial patient .  In addition, each trial patient  will be questioned about AEs.  All AEs that meet the 
criteria specified in  Section  9.2.1  are to be recorded on patient  source documents and on the 
CRFs . AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs .  
9.3.5.  Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
To report AEs on the C RFs, the Investigator  will use the severity grading as described in NCI 
CTCAE (Version 4.03).   
Every effort should be made by the Investigator  to assess the AE according to CTCAE criteria. If 
the Investigator  is unable to assess severity because the term is not described in NCI CTCAE 
(Version 4.03), severity of MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, LIFE -THREATENING, or FATAL 
may be used to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these 
intensity grades are defined as follows:  
Table 21: Adverse Event Grading  
Grade  Non-CTCAE Severity  Definition  
1 Mild  Does not interfere with patient ’s usual function  
2 Moderate  Interferes to some extent with patient ’s usual function  
3 Severe  Interferes significantly with patient ’s usual function  
4 Life-Threatening  Results in immediate risk of patient ’s death  
5 Fatal  Results in patient ’s death  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe AE is not 
necessarily a serious AE.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with 
patient ’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for 
serious events.     
9.3.6.  Relationship to TRC105 Study D rug/Sorafenib  
In this study, TRC105  study drug is given in combination with sorafenib .  The relationship of an 
adverse event to  TRC105 study drug and sorafenib  should be classified by the Investigator  using 
the following guidelines:  
• Suspected Adverse React ion: There is a reasonable possibility that TRC105 caused the 
AE (i.e.: there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between TRC105 and AE). 
• Not Related: There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with TRC105 
study drug .  
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5  
5.3.3.2 Clinical Protocol                                                                                       15February2018  
______ ________________________________________________________________________  
 
 Page 82 of 106 
  
    AE’s relat ed to TRC105 study drug or sorafenib  are considered Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR).  
9.3.7.  Expectedness  
All TRC105 AEs and adverse drug reactions are considered “unexpected” if it’s not listed in the 
investigator brochure or not listed at the specificity or severi ty that has been observed.  For 
example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater 
severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism a nd cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of 
greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that 
are mentio ned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation.  
All sorafenib  AEs and adver se drug reactions are considered “unexpected” if it ’s not listed in the 
package insert or not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. "Unexpected," as 
used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are  mentioned in the 
package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with sorafenib .  
9.3.8.  Exposure in Utero  
An exposure in utero  (EIU) occurs if:  
• A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
directly exposed to (e.g., environmental exposure) the investigational product, or the 
female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly  
exposed to the investigational product (maternal exposure)  
• A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental, to the investigational 
product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during the partner’s 
pregnancy (patern al exposure)  
A pregnant patient will be withdrawn from the study.  If any trial patient  becomes or is found to 
be pregnant during the study or within 28 days of discontinuing the investigational 
medication/product, the Investigator  must report the informa tion to TRACON, or designee  via 
the Pregnancy Notification Report Form .  This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse 
event has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy.  The information 
submitted should include the anticipated da te of delivery.   
The Investigator  will follow the patient  until completion of the pregnancy or until pregnancy 
termination (i .e., induced abortion) and then notify TRACON, or its designee,  of the outcome 
within 5 days or as specified below.  The Investiga tor will provide this information as a follow -
up to the initial report.  The reason(s) for an induced abortion must be specified.  
For pregnancies of partners of male participating in the study: all partners who become pregnant 
and provide appropriate conse nt to TRACON will be monitored to the completion or termination 
of the pregnancy as described above.  
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5  
5.3.3.2 Clinical Protocol                                                                                       15February2018  
______ ________________________________________________________________________  
 
 Page 83 of 106 
  
    The Investigator  should follow procedures for reporting an SAE  if pregnancy outcome meets 
criteria for a n SAE  (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly 
[including that in an aborted fetus]) . 
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth and 
the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form should be completed (i.e., no minimum follow -up period 
of a presumably normal infant must pass before a Pregnancy Outcome Report Form can be 
completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by gross visual inspection 
unless pre -abortion laboratory findings are suggestive of a congeni tal anomaly.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAE s follows:  
• “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.  
• All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality, as SAE s.  In addition, any infant death after 1 month that the Investigator  
assesses as possibly related to the in utero  exposure to the investigational medication 
should also be reported.  
9.3.9.  Follow -up of Unresolved Adverse Events  
All AEs should be followed until they are resolved or the Investigator assesses them as chronic 
or stable; every effort should be made to make this determination by the 28 day follow -up 
visit.   Any increase or decrease in AE grade should be recorded as a new AE.  
All serious and those non -serious AEs assessed by the Investigator as possibly related to the 
investigational medication/product should continue to be followed even after the patient’s 
participation in the trial is over.   Such events should be followed unt il they resolve or until the 
Investigator assesses them as chronic or stable; every effort should be made to make this 
determination by the 28 day follow -up visit.   
9.4. Safety Monitoring  
The TRACON Clinical Team will monitor safety throughout the study via th e following 
activities:  
• Surveillance for SAEs according to regulatory guidelines  
• Routine monitoring of non -serious AEs as they are recorded in the case report forms and 
the source documents at study sites  
• A formally chartered TRACON in-house Safety Review  Team that includes, among other 
staff, two physicians  
• Periodic teleconferences with the Principal Investigators  to share experiences and ensure 
communication  
• Toxicity information that may affect the treatment of patients on this study will be 
promptly com municated in writing to all participating clinical sites and institutions 
participating in this clinical trial.

    11. STATISTICS  
11.1. Phase 1 b 
11.1.1.  Phase 1b Statistical Design/Sample Size  
The number of patient s to be enrolled in this study will depend upon the observed safety profile, 
which will determine the number of patient s per dose level and the number of dose escalations.  
It is anticipated that up to 6 patient s will be treated in the phase 1b portion of the study.   
The probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each underlying true DLT rate is show n 
in Table 22.  For example, at a dose leve l with a true DLT  rate of  5%, th ere is a greater than 95%  
probability of escalating.  Conversely, for a  dose level with a  true DLT  rate of 70%, the 
probability of escalating is < 5%.  
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will have been exceeded if ≥ 33% of pati ents experience 
DLT at a given dose level in which at least 6 patients have been evaluated.  
Table 22: Probability of E scalation to the Next Dose for Each True Underlying DLT 
Rate at a Dose Level  
True Underlying DLT Rate 5% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 
Probability of Escalating Dose  0.97 0.91 0.71 0.49 0.31 0.17 0.08 0.03 0.01 0.001  
The probability of failing to observe DLT  in a sample size of 3 patient s given various t rue 
underlying DLT  rates  is shown in Table 23.  For example, with 3 patient s, the probability of 
failing to observe DLT occurring at least 50% of the time is less than 15%.

The following study populations will be considered when reporting study results:  
• The study population for safety includes all patients receiving at least a portion of 1 
dose of TRC105.   
• The study population for PK includes also subjects with adequate data for PK

    Patients who experience DLT who receive less than the prescribed dose of TRC105 or sorafenib 
due to documented toxicity in cycle 1 will be considered evaluable for dose escalation purposes.  
Only those patients who are deemed ineligible or who receive no therapy (i.e. no TRC105 or 
sorafenib) will be eliminated from the analysis.  Ineligible patients who receive therapy will not 
be included in the assessment of efficacy endpoints, but their dat a will be included in the 
assessment of all adverse event reporting.  
11.2. Phase 2  
11.2.1.  Phase 2 Statistical Design/Sample Size  
Efficacy Analysis  
The primary endpoint of the phase 2 study is objective response (CR or PR) at any time during 
treatment.  The sample size is determined using Simon’s two -stage minimax design.  This design 
will be used to test the null hypothesis that the true objective tu mor response rate is < 5% versus 
the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate is > 20%.  
One or more responses by RECIST 1.1 must be observed in the initial 12 patients enrolled to 
enroll the second stage, to a total of 21 patients.  Three or mor e responses by RECIST of 21 
patients will be considered sufficiently interesting to warrant further study in later trials.  
Sample size justification  
With an alpha level of 0.1 and 80% power, a maximum of 21 treated patients will be required to 
evaluate th e ORR.  Twelve patients will be treated in stage 1.  If < 1 objective response is 
observed in the first 12 patients, then the trial will be terminated, and the alternative hypothesis 
that the true ORR probability is > 20 % will be rejected.  However, if on e or more responses are 
observed in the first 12 patients, then the study will be expanded to enroll a total of 21 treated 
patients (9 additional patients to be treated in stage 2).  At the end of the study, if > 3 objective 
responses are observed then the  null hypothesis that the true response rate probability is < 5% 
will be rejected and further investigation of TRC105 and sorafenib in this population is 
warranted. Under this design, the expected sample size is 21. The probability of early 
termination und er the null hypothesis is 50%.  
The study will continue to enroll patients when the 12th patient has been enrolled unless no 
response is observed. If there is no patient achieving response at the time the 12th patient has 
been enrolled, the enrollment will be stopped temporarily. Once one patient is observed to have 
response, the enrollment will be resumed. However, if there is no patient achieving response 
after the first 12 patients have been fully evaluated, the study will be stopped for the futility.   
11.2.1.1.  Phase 2 Definition of Analyzed Study Populations  
The following study populations will be considered when reporting study results for the phase 2 
portion:  
• The study population for safety includes all patients receiving at least a portion of 1 
dose of TRC105.    
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5

    • The study population for efficacy will include all safety population patients who have 
baseline and follow -up tumor measurements as required for assessment by RECIST 
1.1. 
Only those patients who are deemed ineligible or who receive no therapy (i.e., no TRC105 or 
sorafenib) will be eliminated from the analysis.  Ineligible patients who receive therapy will not 
be included in the assessment of efficacy endpoints, but their data will be included in the 
assessment of all adverse event reporting.  
11.3. Data Analys is 
Descriptive statistics (such as means, medians, standard deviations and ranges for continuous 
data and percentages for categorical data) will be used to summarize patient  characteristics, 
treatment administration/compliance, immunogenicity ( APA ), effica cy, pharmacokinetic 
parameters  protein biomarkers, and archival tumor tissue .  Data will also be displayed 
graphically, where appropriate.  Overall survival and progression -free survival will be presented as 
Kaplan -Meier plots and estimates of the median ti me until death or the earlier of documented 
progression or death , respectively .  
11.4. Analysis of Primary  and Secondary  Objective s  
11.4.1.  Phase 1 b 
For each cohort, DLTs will be summarized by category (hematologic and non -hematologic) and 
by MedDRA preferred term .    
All AEs with an onset  after initiation of treatment will be considered as treatment -emergent AEs.  
A preexisting condition that worsens during the treatment period will also be considered as a 
treatment emergent AE.  All AEs will be coded by system organ c lass (SOC) and preferred term 
using NCI CTCAE (MedDRA) version 4.0.  
The number and percentage of patient s with the following types of treatment -emergent AEs will 
be summarized:  common and serious AEs, AEs related to study medication, AEs resulting in  
study discontinuation, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities . Non-treatment -
emergent serious AEs will be described separately.   Deaths will be reported with demographic 
information.  
11.4.2.  Phase 2  
The primary endpoint of the phase 2 study is objective response (CR or PR) at any time during 
treatment.  The sample size is determined using Simon’s two -stage minimax design.  This design 
will be used to test the null hypothesis that the true objective tu mor response rate is < 5% versus 
the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate is > 20%.

    11.5. Analysis of Pharmacokinetics   
Serum TRC105  and plasma sorafenib  concentrations will be measured using validated methods  
and assessed  for potential correlations with response, PFS, survival, adverse events, baseline 
characteristics and immunogenicity using descriptive statistics and models as appropriate.  
11.6. Analysis of Protein Biomarkers  
Angiogenic protein  biomarker data for each patient who received at least one dose of TRC105 
study drug will be listed . 
11.7. Analysis of Immunogenicity  
Anti-Product Antibody (APA)  concentrations will be measured using validated ELISA methods 
at the time  points specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  5).  APA  concentrations will 
be evaluated in the context of pharmacokinetic parameters and AE profiles.  
11.8. Analysis of Archival Tumor Tissue  
CD105 expression within the tumor vasculature will be quantified for each patient who received 
at least one dose of study drug and will be listed by cohort.  Expression will be determined by 
IHC and/or by PCR.  Other markers that may relate to efficacy or toxicity of TRC10 5 will also 
be explored .

    12. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
All data entered on CRFs/eCRFs must be verifiable within the patients’ source documents 
(written or electronic record).  The Investigator/institution guarantees TRACON representatives 
and appr opriate regulatory authorities direct access to the original source records  for the duration 
of the agreed study record retention period .  Printouts of source records that are electronically 
obtained and stored will not be acceptable for audit/inspection u nless provided as certified exact 
copies and the data remains as meaningful and useful as in its original electronic state.     
Legally protected subject identification and oth er personal health information must be securely 
stored with limited access by th e participating institutions. Unless secure provisions are 
established by the institution to allow TRACON (or designee) to perform remote monitoring of 
electronic source records, TRACON (or designee) will review source records/data on site and 
will not rem ove any such protected health information.

periodically during the trial to ensure that GCPs and all aspects of the proto col are being 
followed.   
The t rial site will also be subject  to possible  inspection by the institutional review board (IRB)  or 
independent ethics committee (IEC)  or other appropriate regulatory authority . The trial site is 
also subject to quality assuranc e (QA) audits performed by TRACON  or its representatives . 
It is important that the Investigator (s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits , audits , and inspections and that sufficient attention, time, and support  is 
devoted to the process.  
TRACON and its representatives will be governed by applicable regulations, good clinical 
practice standards, and internal SOPs for the conduct of monitoring visits and QA audits.

    14. ETHICS  
14.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Independent Ethic s Committee 
(IEC)  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to have approval of the trial protocol, protocol 
amendments, informed consent forms, and advertisements from the IRB/IEC before potential 
patients are consented for participation on the trial. All correspondence and other evidence of 
appropriate and timely communications with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the 
Investigator/site files. Copies of all IRB/IEC approvals should also be forwarded to TRACON.  
The only circumstance in which an amendme nt may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In that 
event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and TRACON in writing within 5 business days 
after the implemen tation.  
14.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The trial will be performed in accordance with  the protocol,  applicable local regulatory 
requirements and laws, and the International Conference on Harmonization Guideline on Good 
Clinical Practice , which supports the application of ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki (see ICH  E6, §2.1).  
14.3. Written Informed Consent  
The informed consent form language must be agreed upon by TRACON and the IRB/IEC and 
must be in compliance with ICH GCP, l ocal regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. 
The informed consent information must not be changed without prior approval by TRACON and 
the IRB/IEC. The informed consent form used in this trial, and any changes made during the 
course of the trial, must be approved by both the IRB/IEC and TRACON, or designee, before 
use.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to give each patient full and adequate verbal and written 
information regarding the objective and procedures of the trial and the possib le risks involved.  
This information must be provided to the patient prior to undertaking any trial -related procedure.  
Patients must be informed about their right to withdraw from the trial at any time.  Furthermore, 
it is the responsibility of the Invest igator to ensure all subjects are appropriately informed before 
obtaining their signed and dated consent . Signature s from the investigator conducting the 
informed consent discussion  should also be obtained  prior to undertaking any trial -related 
procedure. Consent by a legally authorized representative is not permitted. Should an impartial 
witness be needed , ICHE6 requirements for impartial witnesses will apply.  
The Investigator will retain the original of each patient’s signed consent form in the 
Investiga tor/site files.

    15. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING  
15.1. Inspection of Records  
CRF ’s are  required and should be comple ted for each patient who receives treatment with 
TRC105.  Screen failure CRF’s will not be collected .  Nevertheless, records of potential patients 
identified and screened shall be retained  on site screening logs . The completed original CRFs are 
the sole pr operty of TRACON  and should not be made available in any form to third parties  
without written permission from TRACON ( except for authorized representatives of the HRA  
and in accordance with HIPAA regulations).  
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to en sure completion and to review and approve all CRF  
data. The  investigator will sign off on his/her data  per patient.  These signatures serve to attest 
that the investigator has reviewed and approved the information contained on the case report 
forms and tha t the information is complete, accurate, and true.   At all times, the Investigator  has 
final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data 
entered on the CRFs.   
The use of electronic CRFs (eCRFs) to capture  study data using automated computerized data 
capture systems does not change the principles and requirements for collecting study data.  The 
investigator still retains final personal responsibility for eCRF data and any associated data 
pertaining to it (e .g. metadata including any record of change to the originally recorded data).  
The investigator’s signed approval of the eCRF data serves to attest that the electronic data and 
all of its associated metadata (including changes) has been reviewed and accept ed as complete, 
accurate, and true for each patient in the study.  
All CRF /eCRF  data must be verifiable in the patient’s source records  by TRACON  or its 
designee .  TRACON will review CRF data as compared to source records in an attempt to 
identify missing and spurious data and notify the investigator of findings so that proper 
corrections can be made.  TRACON representatives (monitors and auditors), and regulatory 
inspectors shall have direct access to the original source r ecords in its original recorded format: 
electronic or hardcopy.    
TRACON  (or its designee) will perform all data management functions associated with the 
study.  Data will be captured electronically .  Automated data verification (“ edit checks ”) will be 
used to ensure that the data are logical and consistent.  Any inconsistencies will be queried for 
clarification or correction as appropriate by the clinical site.    
15.2. Retention of Records  
To allow for appropriate evaluations and/or audits by regulatory authoriti es or TRACON, the 
Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient 
information to link records, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent 
forms, copies of all CRFs, source document s, and detailed records of treatment disposition.  The 
Investigator should retain these records according to local regulations or as specified in the 
Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer.   
IND 100522                                                                          105HCC101  Protocol  Amendment 5

    If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason  withdraws from the study, then TRACON 
should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to an acceptable 
designee, such as another Investigator, another institution, or to TRACON.  The Investigator 
must inform TRACON of any such tra nsfer of responsibilities and properly identify the person or 
institution assuming the responsibility.  The responsible investigator/institution must obtain 
TRACON’s written permission before disposing of any records.

    16. DEFINITION OF END OF  TRIAL  
16.1. End of Tr ial in all Participating Countries  
End of trial in all participating countries is defined as the time at which all patients enrolled in 
the study have completed treatment on study.  
16.2. End of Trial in a Member State  
End of trial in a Member State of the Europe an Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient patients have been recruited and completed the trial as stated in the 
regulatory application (e.g. the Clinical Trials Agreement (CTA)) and ethics application in the 
Member State.  Poor recruitment is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a 
normal conclusion to the trial in that Member State.  
16.3. TRACON Discontinuation Criteria  
Premature termination of this trial may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change  
in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of TRACON.  In addition, 
TRACON retains the right to discontinue development of TRC105 at any time.  
TRACON reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intende d number of 
patients, but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons. If a 
trial is prematurely terminated or discontinued, TRACON will promptly notify the Investigator.  
After notification, the Investigator must con tact all participating patients within a 28 day time 
period.  As directed by TRACON, all trial materials must be collected and all CRF data must be 
completed to the greatest extent possible.

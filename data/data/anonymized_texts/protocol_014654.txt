 Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
 
The administration of OC-01 0.6 mg/mL and 1.2 mg/mL (varenicline) Nasal S pray was safe, well 
tolerated, and efficacious as assessed in the ONSET-1 study. The study met the primary endpoint 
(Schirmer’s Test) for both the 0.6 mg/mL and 1.2 mg/mL dose  groups . It also met the secondary 
symptom endpoints (EDS) for 0.6 mg/mL OC -01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray. There was not a 
statistically significant improvement in EDS in the normal environment at Day 28 for the 1.2 
mg/mL dose, although there was a numerical benefit as compared to placebo.  Because of the 
pre-specified hierarchical approach to multip licity for the seconda ry outcomes, the EDS 
symptoms within the CAE® environment at Day 21 could not be formally tested; however, the 
data strongly suggest benefit on that outcome as well. Although the low dose of 0.12 mg/mL OC-
01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray demonstrated statistical significance in Schirmer’s Score in 
exploratory analyses, this dose did not yield statistically significant difference in the symptom 
endpoint in exploratory analyses as measured by EDS.   
Showing statistical significance in both signs and symptoms of DED in the same study population 
is a goal seldom before achieved in the treatment of the disease.  Importantly, after treatment with 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray, improvements in EDS were seen as early as 5 minutes after 
administration in the CAE® in the 0.6 mg/mL and 1.2 mg/mL OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal S pray 
dose groups.  Exploratory analyses of fluorescei n corneal staining indica te a benefit in subjects 
treated with OC -01 (varenicline) Nasal S pray compared to those subjects treated with placebo.   
 
OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray was safe and well- tolerated at all concentrations assessed in the 
ONSET -1 clinical study.  Most TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity, with only 1 subject 
reporting a severe TEAE. 
 
The most common AE in all treatment groups was sneezing which was temporally related to the 
administration of the study drug and resolved within  a short period of time after administration.  
Sneezing AEs were characterized as mild to modera te, with no severe AEs reported. 
 
All AEs that were suspected to be related to the study drug with the exception of AE s with each of 
the following terms; nasal dryness, nasal congestion and throat irritation were reported to be 
recovered/or resolved before  study completion.  Eleven ocular TEAEs were reported, 7 of which 
were reported in the placebo group; all other AEs were classified as non -ocular. The Investigators 
considered 3 of the 7 ocular TEAEs (visual acui ty reduced, conjunctival hemorrhage, and eyelid 
oedema) to be possibly related to study drug, all resolved, and none was categorized as severe. 
One treatment -emergent SAE (anemia) was reported and was considered to be unrelated to study 
drug. No treatment -related treatment-emergent SAEs were observe d. No deaths occurred during 
the study. Visual acuity, slit -lamp biomicroscopy, intranasal examination, and pupil diameter did 
not indicate clinically significant changes from baseline. These data  from the ONSET-1 study 
suggest that 28 days of BID delivery  of OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray is safe and efficacious in 
subjects with DED.  DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

 8.1.3 Washout Intervals  
Prohibited medications, treatments, and activities are outlined in the Exclusion Criteria 
(Section 5.4 ).  
8.1.4 Procedures for Final Study Entry 
Subjects must meet all inclusion criteri a and none of the exclusion criteria.  
8.1.5 Methods for Assignment to Treatment Groups 
Each subject who enters the screening period for the study (defined as the point at which the 
subject signs the informed consent form (ICF ) receives a unique subject identification 
number before any study-related activities/proced ures are performed.  This number will be 
used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.   
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study.   
Subjects who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups. 
The randomization will be st ratified by three factors: 
x Pre-procedure (Baseline) anesthetized Schirmer’s score ( <5, >5) measured the 
screening/randomization visit  
x Pre-procedure (Baseline) EDS (<60, >60) meas ured at the screening/randomization 
visit  
x Study site 
A central randomization list will be created us ing block randomization. Sites will be assigned 
entire blocks as needed. 
 
8.2 Concomitant Therapies  
The use of any concurrent medication, prescription or over-the-counter, is to be recorded on 
the subject’s source document and corresponding  eCRF along with the reason the medication 
was taken.  
Concurrent enrollment in another investigati onal drug or device study during the treatment 
period is not permitted.

9 SAFETY DEFINITIONS, SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING 
9.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unt oward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered drug-related.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintende d sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease occurring after the subj ect started dosing with the study drug, without 
any judgment about causality.  Any pre-ex isting medical condition that worsens after 
administration of the study drug will also be considered a new AE.   
Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and placebo. 
AE collection will start following the first ad ministration of study drug until the last follow 
up visit of the study.     
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action(s) tak en, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject upon indirect questioning. 
9.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by the investigator or reported to him/her by the patient/s ubject.  The assessment 
of severity is made irrespective of relationship to study drug or seriousness of the event and 
should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
x Mild:  Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
x Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
x Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of 
therapy, and interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
9.1.2 Relationship to Study Drug 
The relationship of each AE to the investigational product should be determined by the investigator (in a blinded manner) using these explanations: 
x Definite:  When there are good reason and sufficient documentation to demonstrate a 
direct causal relationship between investigational product and AE DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-101  
Amendment #1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 of 55 
 x Probable: When there are good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relationship in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely but not necessarily highly probable 
x Possible: When there is sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal relationship in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection is uncertain or doubtful, for example; due to missing data or 
insufficient evidence. 
x None: When there is sufficient information to accept a lack of a causal relationship, in the sense of impossible and improbable . 
x Unclassified: When the causal relationship is not assessable for whatever reason due 
to insufficient evidence, conflicting data or poor documentation.  
9.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be deter mined based upon existing safety information 
about the study drug using these explanations: 
x Unexpected:  An AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed . 
x Expected: An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed.  
x Not Applicable: Any AE that is unrelated to the study drug. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with 
the particular drug under investigati on are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final classification is subject to th e Medical Monitor’s determination.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is considered “serious ” (SAE) if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: 
x Death 
 
x A life-threatening AE 
Note: An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator 
or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death. 
x Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray Sponsor: Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol # OPP-101  
Amendment #1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 30 of 55 
 Note: The term “inpatient hospitalization” refers to any inpatient admission (even if 
less than 24 hours).  For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission includes 
transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care inpatient unit.  Inpatient hospitalization does not include:  emergency room visits; outpatient/same-
day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; 
hospice facilities; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units. 
Note:  The term “prolongation of existing hospi talization” refers to any extension of 
an inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required for the reason for 
the initial admission as determined by th e investigator or treating physician. 
x A persistent or significant incapacity or subs tantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
Note:  An SAE specifically related to visual threat would be interpreted as any 
potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., hemorrhage, retinal 
detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic nerve). 
x A congenital anomaly/birth defect in an offspring of a study subject. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious wh en, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   
SAEs are collected at the time the subject signs the Informed Consent Form until the last 
follow up visit of the study.   
9.3 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to the Sponsor, and the IRB/IEC as 
required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
9.3.1 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction  
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to the Sponsor and the 
IRB/IEC as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, st ate, or local regulations and governing health 
authorities. 
9.3.2 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs, regardless of relationship to the study drug, must be 
immediately reported.  All information relevant to the SAE must be recorded on the 
appropriate CRFs.  The investigator is oblig ated to pursue and obtain information requested 
by  and/or the Sponsor in addition to that information reported on the CRF.  All subjects 
experiencing a SAE must be follo wed up and the outcome reported. DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

Amendment #1  
 
CONFIDENTIAL Page 31 of 55 
 In the event of a SAE, the investigator must notify  and the Sponsor immediately; obtain 
and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and medical 
judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow-up of the subject; 
provide  and the Sponsor with a complete case  history, which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the study drug; and inform the IRB of the SAE within their guidelines for reporting SAEs.

9.4 Procedures for Unmasking of Study Drug 
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved with the conduct of the study will be 
masked with regard to treatment assignments. When medically necessary, the investigator 
may need to determine what treatment regimen has been assigned to a subject. When 
possible (i.e., in non-emergent situations),  and/or the Sponsor should be notified before 
unmasking study drug. Unmasking will be perf ormed utilizing the randomization system.  
The unmasked subject will continue the study if warranted by the Investigator in consultation 
with the Medical Monitor.  
9.5 Type and Duration of the Follow-up of Subjects after Adverse Events 
The investigator will follow unresolved AEs to resolution until the subject is lost to follow-
up or until the AE is otherwise classified. Resolution means the subject has returned to 
baseline state of health or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the AE. If the patient is lost to follow-up, the Investigator should make 3 
reasonable attempts to contact the patient vi a telephone, post, or certified mail. All follow-up DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

CONFIDENTIAL Page 32 of 55 
 will be documented in the subject’s source document. Non -serious AEs identified on the last 
scheduled contact must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the status noted.  
If the Investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an existing SAE (i.e., 
resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new SAE/Unanticipated Report Form 
must be completed and faxed to  within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the new 
information. The original SAE form is not to be altered. The report should describe whether 
the event has resolved or conti nues and how the event was treated. 
10 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Statistical considerations and methods of analyses for this study are provided below; the 
accompanying Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) contains complete details of the planned 
analyses.  
10.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint: 
x Percent of subjects who achieve ≥10 mm improvement in Schirmer’s Test Score from 
baseline at Visit 4 (Day 28)  
Secondary Endpoints 
x Mean change from Baseline in Eye Dryness  Score (EDS) at 5 minutes after threshold 
defined treatment administration in the Controlled Adverse Environment® Chamber 
at Visit 4 (Day 28) 
x Mean change from Baseline in Eye Dryne ss Score (EDS) at Visit 4 (Day 28) (Post 
STS) 
x Mean change from Baseline in Schirmer’s Test Score  (STS) at Visit 4 (Day 28) 
x Mean change from Baseline in Corneal Fluorescein Staining at Visit 4 (Day 28) 
10.2 Analysis Populations 
10.2.1 Intention-To-Treat Population  
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects. Analyses using the 
ITT population will group subjects according to the treatment to which they were randomized.  
10.2.2 Safety Population 
The safety population will include all randomized  subjects who received at least one dose of 
the study drug. Analysis on the safety population will group subjects according to the 
treatment actually received.  DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

 10.3 Statistical Hypotheses 
Let p l, ph, and p p denote the percent of subjects in each group (low dose, high dose, and 
placebo, respectively) who have ≥  10mm change from baseline to Visit 4 in STS. 
 H 0: pl – p p = 0 or p h – p p = 0 
 H 1: pl – p p ≠ 0 or p h – p p ≠ 0 
10.4 Sample Size and Power Considerations 
The study will randomize approximately 750 subject s in a 1:1:1 ratio to the three treatment 
groups. Approximately 250 subjects in each treatment group are expected to complete their 
assigned treatment and have e ndpoint assessments at Visit 4. 
For the primary endpoint, the percent of subjects achieving > 10 mm improvement from 
Baseline in STS at Visit 4,  the ONSET-1 study had roughly 15% of subjects in the placebo 
group and 50% in each of the 0.6 mg/ml and 1.2 mg/ml groups.  If the true proportion achieving at least a 10 mm improvement is 15% in the placebo group and, conservatively, 
40% in each of the active arms, the power  for each dose would be greater than 99%.
 
The secondary endpoint is the EDS test. The ONSET-1 study showed a roughly 12 unit 
difference between placebo and each active treat ment group in mean change from baseline to 
day 28 with a standard deviation (SD) of roughly 26 units. If these estimates apply to the 
Phase III ONSET-2 study and the data are analyzed with an analysis of variance, the study will have approximately 99% power for each dose. 
 
10.5 Statistical Analysis 
This section briefly outlines the planned efficacy analyses. The statistical analysis plan (SAP) 
describes the methods to be used in detail. If the SAP and the protocol disagree, the details 
and methods of the SAP will prevail. 
10.5.1 General Considerations 
Quantitative variables will be summarized using the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, 
median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and minimum and maximum. Qualitative variables will be 
summarized using counts and percentages. 
All summaries will be presented by treatm ent group. Summaries will be provided for 
demographics, medical history, concomitant medications, and subject disposition. 
For the summaries, medical history, concomitan t medications, and AEs will be coded to 
MedDRA and World Health Organization Drug dictionaries, as appropriate. DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

 10.5.6 Safety Analysis 
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. 
The safety of OC-01 (varenicline) will be asse ssed primarily by the incidence of AEs. An AE 
will be considered a treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) if it occurs or worsens on or after 
initiation of treatment. An overall summar y of TEAEs will be presented including the 
number of events and the number of subjects with events (along with percentages) by 
treatment group for TEAEs in several categories base on seriousness, relationship to treatment, and severity.  
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and intranasal 
examination will be summarized by treatment group and visit using descriptive statistics. 
Changes or shifts from baseline will be summarized where appropriate. For assessments performed by eye, study eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately.  
The SAP will present methods of analysis of these defined parameters in detail. 
10.5.7 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis planned for this study. 
11 COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES, ETHICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practices,

11.8 Publications 
The study will be documented in a final report , which will contain appropriate statistical 
analysis and medical overview. No individual site or Investigator may publish or present any 
results from the study until the Sponsor completes a joint, multi-center publication of the trial 
results in conjunction with various partic ipating Investigators and appropriate sites 
contributing data and comments. Subsequently, individual Investigators may request to publish or present results from the trial; however, approval will be at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Should the foregoing language be in conflict with the language addressing 
publication in the clinical trial agreement, the language in the Clinical Trial Agreement will prevail.  DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

 APPENDIX 2: EXAMINATION PROCEDURES, TESTS, EQUIPMENT, AND 
TECHNIQUES  
The following examination procedures, tests, equipment and techniques are listed in this 
Appendix:  
Visual Acuity Procedures  
LogMAR visual acuity must be assessed using an ETDRS chart. The procedure used will be 
consistent with the recommendations provided for using the ETDRS eye chart. Visual acuity 
should be evaluated at the beginning of each visit in the study (i.e., prior to slit lamp 
examination). Participants should use the most recent correction to attain their corrected 
distance visual acuity (CDVA); if they forget thei r spectacles, this prescription can be placed 
in a trial frame. 
Equipment 
The visual acuity chart to be used is the ETDRS chart. If smaller reproduction (18" by 18", 
e.g., from Prevent Blindness) wall charts are us ed, the participant viewing distance should be 
exactly 10 feet (or as specified by the manufacturer). In ALL cases, for purposes of standardizing the testing conditions during the study, all sites must use only ETDRS Series 
2000 Chart 1 & 2, and the right eye should be tested first. For reflectance (wall) charts, the chart should be placed frontally and be well illuminated. 
Measurement Technique 
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle. The right eye should be tested first. The 
participant should attempt to read each letter, li ne-by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 
at the top of the chart. The participant should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers. If the participant reads a number, s/he should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number. The 
participant should be asked to read slowly, so as to achieve the best identification of each 
letter. S/he is not to proceed to the next letter until s/he has given a definite response. 
If the participant changes a response (e.g., 'that was a "C" not an "O"') before s/he has read 
aloud the next letter, then the change must be  accepted. If the participant changes a response 
having read the next letter, then the change is not accepted. The examiner should never point 
to the chart or to specific letters on the chart during the test. 
A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the participant 
says s/he cannot read a letter, s/he should be en couraged to guess. If the participant identifies 
a letter as one of two letters, s/he should be asked to choose one letter and, if necessary, to 
guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, despite 
encouragement to read or guess, the examiner should stop the test for that eye. However, all 
letters on the last line should be attempted as letter difficulties vary and the last may be the 
only one read correctly. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted. DocuSign Envelope ID: F01AD6EA-5F19-4D78-B20A-26B5F08F3F5A

 LogMAR Visual Acuity Calculations 
The last line in which a letter is read correctly  will be taken as the base logMAR reading. To 
this value will be added the number "N x 0.02" where 'N' represents the total number of 
letters missed up to and including the last line read. This total sum represents the logMAR visual acuity for that eye. 
Example: Participant correctly reads 4 of 5 letters on the 0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on the 0.1 
line. 
Base logMAR  = 0.1 
N (total number of letters incorrect on line 0.2 as well as 0.1)  = 4 
N x T (T=0.02)  = 0.08  
Base logMAR + (N x T)  = 0.1 + 0.08 
logMAR visual acuity = 0.18  
 
Repeat the procedure for the left eye. 
In order to provide standardized and well-controlled assessments of visual acuity during the 
study, all visual acuity assessments at a single site must be consistently done using the same 
lighting conditions and same correction if possible during the entire study. If the same correction cannot be used (i.e., a participant br oke his/her glasses), the reason for the change 
in correction should be documented. 
Note: A clinically significant visual acuity decr ease (defined as an increase of 0.32 or greater 
in logMAR score) from the Screening Visit (Visit 1) should be evaluated by the Investigator 
as a potential AE.

 Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy will be performed during the study. Observations will be graded as 
Normal  or Abnormal. Abnormal findings, which are clinically significant, will be described.  
Corneal Fluorescein Staining  
The examiner should instill 5 PL of 2% preservative-free sodium fluorescein solution into the 
inferior conjunctival cul-de-sac of each eye. Alternatively, corneal staining can be assessed 
using 1.0 mg sodium fluorescein strips. After moistening the tip of the strip with sterile 
buffered saline, the excess is shaken into a waste bin with a sharp flick. The lower lid is then 
pulled down and the flat end of the tip should be gently applied to the inferior tarsal 
conjunctiva with the intent of not inducing reflex tearing and instilling a very small volume 
of dye.  
The participant will be instructed to blink naturally several times without forced closure of 
the eyelid to distribute the fluorescein. In  order to achieve maximum fluorescence, the 
examiner should wait at least two minutes after instillation before evaluating corneal 
fluorescein staining. A Wratten #12 yellow filter w ill be used to enhance the ability to grade 
fluorescein staining. The staining will be graded with the NEI Scale. The upper eyelid is lifted slightly to grade the entire corneal surface.

 Schirmer’s Test with  Topical Anesthesia  
At the Screening Visit, one basal Schirmer’s te st will be performed followed by a Schirmer’s 
test with cotton swab nasal stimulation. The Schirmer’s test with topical anesthetic will be 
used to assess tear production using the following steps:   
1. Topical anesthetic drops such as 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride or equivalent should 
be instilled in both eyes of the participant. 
2. The participant will be instructed to keep the eyes gently closed for one minute.   
3. After opening the eyes and allowing the eyes to recover for approximately one additional 
minute, excess moisture in the inferior fornix is gently removed with a spear. 
4. Schirmer’s strips (35 mm x 5 mm size filter paper strip) will be placed in each eye at the 
junction of the middle and lateral thirds of the lower eye lid.  
5. Under ambient light, the participant will be instructed to look forward and to blink normally during the course of the test. The test should be performed in a room with no direct air or sunlight on the participant’s face. 
6. The Schirmer’s strips should remain in place until five minutes have elapsed or both strips have reached maximum score. 
7. After five minutes, strips will be removed f rom both eyes and the amount of wetting will 
be recorded. The strips should be taped to the CRF.   
Schirmer’s test using cotton swab nasal stimulation    
At the Screening Visit, the Schirmer’s test should be performed us ing cotton swab nasal 
stimulation. New anesthetic drops should be in stilled following the same procedure specified 
in steps #1 to 3 above. 
1. With new strips in place, the examiner should insert cotton swabs in the participant’s two 
nostrils simultaneously and gently probe both nasal middle turbinates for approximately 
30 seconds. After this, the examiner can simply  hold the swabs in place, applying gentle 
pressure, and repeat probing intermittently as necessary.   
2. Alternatively, the participant can be instruc ted to hold the cotton swabs and gently probe 
both nasal turbinates simultaneously, resti ng intermittently before probing again.  The 
examiner should continuously coach the participant on how to perform this test properly.  
3. The Schirmer’s strips should remain in place until five minutes have elapsed or both 
strips have reached maximum score. 
Both Schirmer’s scores will be  recorded and verified that they meet the inclusion criteria.

STUDY DESIGN This is a multi -center, open-label, Phase 3 study in L-Dopa responsive PD 
subjects with motor fluctuations, designed to evaluate  the long- term safety, 
tolerability and efficacy of APL -130277. 
 
Screening Procedures for De Novo Subjects 
De Novo subjects are defined as subjects who have not previously 
participated in a study with APL-130277. 
Before any study procedures are performed on any subject , informed 
consent must be obtained at an initial Screening Visit (SV1). If required by the Investigator, and following receipt of subject consent, the Investigator 
may review the subject’s medical history, BMI, height, weight, vital signs, 
12-Lead ECG (in triplicate) and perform a complete physical examination at 
SV1 to determine if the subject may be eligible for study participation and 
continuation onto the second Screening Visit (SV2).  
Subjects recruited to participate in the study, and who have provided full 
consent to participate, will be asked to attend the second Screening Visit 
(SV2), and will be instructed to arrive at the clinic after their usual morning 
dose of PD medications; but before taking their next dose of medication. 
Their normal morning dose of L-Dopa ( without adjunctive PD medication) 
will be administered in the clinic approximately two hours after their normally scheduled second dose of PD medication, following confirmation of an "OFF" episode by the Investigator, to ensure that they experience a 
full "ON" response. Eligibility criteria will be assessed and subject 
"ON"/"OFF"  training will be performed.  
Subjects will be asked to return to clinic in the morning of Titration Visit 1 
(TV1) for the Dose Titration Phase of the study, and will be instructed to 
arrive at the clinic after their usual morning dose of PD medications; but 
before taking their next dose of medication. 
 
 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 11  25 February 2019 Screening Procedures fo r Rollover Subjects 
Rollover subjects are defined as subjects who have previously completed 
any of the following studies: CTH -201, CTH-203, CTH-300, or CTH -302. 
Subjects will be required to attend the Screening Visit and applicable 
eligibility assessments will be performed. This visit will occur up to 14 days 
after the final visit of the previous APL-130277 study. Subjects will present 
to clinic following their normal PD medication regimen and should not 
withhold any of their normal PD medications . Screenin g procedures will be 
performed while subject is in the “ON” state.  
Subjects will begin treatment at the last APL -130277 dose level they were 
taking in the previous study. These subjects will not undergo titration. 
however, if during the screening visit, th e Investigator determines a dose 
adjustment is necessary, the subject will have dose adjustment visits.  
Subjects who fail the screening process will be allowed to rescreen once if 
agreed by the Medical Monitor.  
 
Screening Procedures for CTH -301 Completer Subjects  
CTH-301 Completer subjects are defined as subjects who have previously 
completed the CTH -301 study under protocol version 3.00. 
Subjects who previously completed the CTH-301 study and are re-enrolling 
into CTH-301 will be required to attend the Screening Visit Phase 2 (SVP2) 
and applicable eligibility assessments will be performed.  
Eligibility criteria will be assessed and once a patient is deemed eligible, the 
site will contact the subject to have them return to the clinic 5 to 28 days 
later and follow study procedures beginning at LTS Visit 7. These subjects 
will resume treatment with APL -130277 at the dose he/she was 
administered prior to completing study CTH-301. If this dose is no longer effective, the subject will return to the clinic for dose adjustment visits.  
Subjects who fail the screening process will be allowed to rescreen once if agreed by the Medical Monitor.  
 
Dose Titration Phase - De Novo Subjects Only  
On Titration Visit 1 (TV1), subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinic after 
their usual morning dose of PD medications; but before taking their next 
dose of medication. Subjects will be required to wait approximately two 
hours after their normally scheduled second dose of PD medications and following confirmation by both the Investi gator and subject that they are in 
the "OFF" state, patients will be treated with 10  mg APL-130277. Efficacy 
(MDS-UPDRS Part III) will be performed prior to dosing, and at 15, 30, 60, 
and 90 minutes after dosing. Safety assessments (adverse events [AEs], 
vital signs [including supine and standing blood pressure (BP) to assess 
orthostatic hypotension (OH)] will be performed prior to dosing, and 
immediately after the 60 minute MDS -UPDRS Part III assessment.  
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be obtained prior to dosing and 
approximately 50 minutes after dosing. 
Subjects who respond to the 10 mg APL -130277 dose with a full "ON" 
response within 45 minutes at TV1, as assessed by both the patient and 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 12  25 February 2019 Investigator, will be considered complete from a Dose Titration Phas e 
perspective, and can proceed to the Long- Term Safety (LTS) Phase of the 
study. These subjects will be asked to return to the clinic for LTS Visit 1 
(LTS V1). A full " ON", as assessed by the subject, is defined as: a period of 
time where medication is pro viding benefit with regard to mobility, stiffness 
and slowness and where a subject feels he/she can perform normal daily 
activities; AND the response is comparable to or better than their normal 
response to PD medications prior to enrolling in the study. A full "ON", as 
determined by the Investigator, is defined as: per clinical judgement, the 
period of time where the Investigator feels the medication is providing 
benefit with regard to mobility, stiffness and slowness and the subject has 
adequate motor fun ction to allow them to perform their normal daily 
activities.  
Subjects who develop symptoms such as nausea and/or vomiting which 
warrant treatment may receive anti -emetic therapy (US sites – Tigan® 
[trimethobenzamide hydrochloride; 300 mg t.i.d.]; non- US sites – 
domperidone [10 mg b.i.d.]). If initiated, anti- emetic therapy should be 
stopped when clinically indicated. Anti- emetic medication should not be 
administered prophylactically. 
Subjects who do not achieve a full " ON" response (as defined above) with 
their 10 mg APL -130277 dose will restart their normal PD medications and 
will be asked to return to clinic within the next 3 days for Titration Visit  2 
(TV2), to assess the next highest dose ( ie, 15 mg) in a manner identical to 
that on Titration Visit 1 (T V1), with identical evaluations. 
All subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinic after their usual morning 
dose of PD medications, but before taking their next dose of medication. 
Subjects will be required to wait approximately two hours after their 
normally scheduled second dose of PD medications before being dosed with 15 mg APL -130277. Subjects who achieve a full "ON" (as defined above) 
within 45 minutes of receiving the 15 mg dose will be considered complete 
from a Dose Titration Phase perspective, and can proceed to the LTS Phase. 
Subjects who do not achieve a full " ON" response (as defined above) within 
45 minutes of dosing at TV2 will restart their standard PD medication s and 
be asked to return to the clinic within the next 3 days to assess the nex t 
highest dose of APL -130277 (20 mg [TV3], 25 mg [TV4], 30 mg [TV5] or 
35 mg [TV6], as appropriate). For subjects dosed with 35 mg, the first 
sublingual film (ie, 20 mg) will be placed under the tongue for 3 minutes 
before placing the second sublingual fil m (ie, 15 mg) under the tongue 
immediately after and without delay.  
For each visit in the Dose Titration Phase, the site will arrange subject 
transfers, if needed. Alternatively, subjects may be monitored in the clinic 
overnight if such facilities exist an d the subject consents. These occurrences 
will not be considered a SAE. Safety and efficacy assessments will be 
performed at each visit exactly as described above. Subjects who achieve a 
full "ON" response at any titration visit may proceed to the LTS Phase.  
At all titration visits, at the discretion of the subject and/or Investigator, the 
next highest dose may be evaluated at a subsequent titration visit following 
a full "ON" response in order to assess the potential for the next highest 
dose in inducing a n improved full "ON" response. If this dose produces an 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 13  25 February 2019 improved "ON" response relative to the lower dose without impacting 
subject safety and tolerability, the higher dose will be used during the LTS 
Phase of the study. If the "ON" response is the same or worse, or this higher dose is not well-tolerated, the previous dose will be used during the LTS 
Phase of the study. 
During the Dose Titration Phase visits, if in the opinion of the Investigator 
the subject can no longer tolerate the "OFF" state at any point during the 
Visit, the subject may receive rescue L -Dopa (± other adjunctive PD 
medication) at a dosage considered appropriate by the Investigator to 
achieve a full "ON" state. If this occurs, subjects can return to the clinic on 
another day to resume th e titration with the next highest dose. If a dose of 
APL-130277 cannot be found that provided a full "ON" response, the 
subject will be terminated from the study. 
In this study, the minimum titration dose is 10 mg APL -130277 and the 
maximum titration dose is 35 mg APL -130277. Any subjects who reach 
35 mg at Titration Visit 6 (TV6) and do not exhibit a full "ON" response (as defined above) within 45 minutes will be terminated from the study and will 
have the applicable procedures outlined in the Early Termin ation Visit 
performed. 
Dosing days in the Dose Titration Phase are not required occur 
consecutively, but the Dose Titration Phase must be completed within 
21 days. Following completion of the titration phase, subjects will return to 
clinic for LTS V1 where  they will be given their open -label study 
medication (APL-130277) and appropriate training for self- administration.  
Titration in this study may be modified following a review of the Dose 
Titration Phase data from CTH-300 by a Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). If, after review of the data from CTH -300, the DSMB determines 
that in-clinic titration  is not necessary  and that dos e titration  can be safely 
accomplished in an outpatient  setting, the Dose Titration Phase paradigm 
may be modified. 
 
LTS Phase Year  1 – In-clinic Visits  – De Novo and Rollover Subjects Only 
De novo s ubjects who successfully completed the Dose Titration Phase of 
the study will be asked to return to the clinic on LTS Day 1 (LTS V1) 
where they will be given their dose of APL -130277. This  visit will up to 
21 days after the final visit in the Dose Titration Phase of the study. The 
dose given will be the same as that determined during the Dose Titration 
Phase of the study.  
Rollover subjects who successfully completed the Screening visit (SV 1) 
will return to the clinic up to 21 days after SV1. These subjects will receive 
the same dose they received in the previous study , unless the Investigator 
deems a dose adjustment is necessary.  
All subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinic after thei r usual morning 
dose of PD medications, but before taking their next dose of medication. Subjects will be required to wait approximately two hours after their 
normally scheduled second dose of PD medications. Following a confirmed "OFF" state by both the s ubject and Investigator, subjects will be dosed 
with their study medication and assessments of efficacy and safety will be 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 14  25 February 2019 performed up to 90 minutes after dosing. During this visit, De novo subjects 
only, will be trained by clinic staff on how to remove s tudy medication 
from its packaging and how to self-administer their dose using placebo 
sublingual films supplied to the site. Subjects should not  self-administer the 
placebo sublingual films. Subjects cannot be discharged from the clinic 
until satisfactorily completing the training.  
At the in-clinic visits, staff will dose subjects with APL -130277 by 
placing the sublingual film under the  subject’s tongue (see Section 14.2 
for full dosing details). Subjects will be asked to follow the same process 
of study drug administration during the at -home portion s of the study.  
During LTS Phase Year 1 of the study, subjects will return to the clinic at 
4 weeks for LTS Visit 2 (LTS V2) , 12 weeks  for LTS Visit 3 (LTS V3), 
24 weeks for LTS Visit  4 (LTS V4) , 36 weeks for LTS Visit 5 (LTS V5) , 
and 48 weeks for LTS Visit 6 (LTS V6) . At LTS V3, LTS V4, LTS V5, and 
LTS V6, subjects will be dosed with APL -130277 and the procedures 
performed at these visits will be similar to those perform ed at LTS V1. 
LTS V2 will be a safety visit only.  
At the LTS in -clinic visits where the subject is dosed with APL-130277, if 
in the opinion of the Investigator the subject can no longer tolerate the 
"OFF" state at any point during the visit, the subject may receive rescue 
L-Dopa (± other adjunctive PD medication) at a dosage considered 
appropriate by the Investigator to achieve a full "ON" state. Where possible, 
administration of rescue L -Dopa should be delayed until after the 90 minute 
efficacy assessments are complete.  
Following LTS V6, subjects will be asked to return to the clinic 
approximately 4 months (16 weeks ± 1 week)  later for LTS Visit 7 
(LTS V7). 
Evaluation of subjects who choose to withdraw from the study at any time 
will be conducted in accorda nce with Section  12.8, Early Terminations.  
All PD medications must remain stable during LTS Phase Year 1, and any changes should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and approved by the 
Medical Monitor. Changes in medications for the treatment of other medical 
disorders are allowed with permission from the Medical Monitor. 
LTS Phase Year 1 – At Home Assessments – De Novo and Rollover Subjects 
Only 
During the LTS Phase, subjects will be instructed to continue wit h their 
regular PD medication regimen(s), but should dose themselves with their 
study treatment (APL -130277) if they experience an "OFF" episode 
(eg, morning akinesia, wearing "OFF", dose failure, sudden "OFF", etc.) 
while on their current treatment regimen. Subjects will be instructed to dose up to 5 "OFF" episodes per day during the waking period. Subjects will be 
instructed to wait a minimum of 2 hours between doses taken at home. 
For 2 days prior to the in -clinic visits, subjects will be requested to 
complete a dosing diary that captures:  
• Time of APL-130277 treatment self-administration; 
• Subject "ON"/"OFF" states at 30  minutes after dosing. 
• The type of "OFF" experienced (ie, morning akinesia; delayed 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 15  25 February 2019 "ON"; wearing "OFF"; no "ON"; or sudden "OFF").  
Between each in -clinic visit, subjects will be contacted at the midpoint 
between visits by the site to assess subject well -being and safety. If required 
due to safety concerns or lack of efficacy, subjects will be asked to return to 
the clinic for additional eva luations at an unscheduled Dose Adjustment 
Visit. 
LTS Phase Year s 2, 3, 4, and 5 – In -clinic Visits - All Subjects 
During LTS Phase Year s 2 to 5, subjects will return to the clinic every 
4 months (16 weeks) . These visits will be safety visits only. 
Subjects will return to the clinic to have safety assessed and receive 
additional study drug (APL-130277). 
Subjects may continue to participate in the study until the Sponsor 
terminates the study, or until  commercial availability of APL -130277 in the 
patient's co untry. If a patient continues in the study beyond LTS Phase Year 
5, the protocol will be amended to accommodate additional in clinic visits 
every 4 months (16 weeks).  
Evaluation of subjects who choose to withdraw from the study at any time 
will be conduct ed in accordance with Section 12.8, Early Terminations.  
All PD medications should remain stable during LTS Phase Years 2 to 5, 
and any changes should be avoided unless approved by the Medical 
Monitor. Changes in medications for the treatment of other medical 
disorders are allowed with permission from the Medical Monitor. 
LTS Phase Years 2, 3, 4, and 5 – At Home Assessments – All Subjects 
During LTS Phase Years 2 to 5, subjects will be instructed to continue with 
their regular PD medication regimen(s), but should dose themselves with their study treatment (APL -130277) if they experience an "OFF" episode 
(eg, morning akinesia, wearing "OFF", dose failure, sudden "OFF", etc.) 
while on their current treatment regimen. Subjects will be instructed to dose 
up to 5 "OFF" episodes per day. Subjects will be instructed to wait a minimum of 2 hours between doses taken at home. 
For 2 days prior to the in -clinic visits, subjects will be requested to 
complete a dosing diary that c aptures: 
• Time of APL-130277 treatment self-administration; 
• Subject "ON"/"OFF" states at 30 minutes after dosing.  
• The type of "OFF" experienced (ie, morning akinesia; delayed

METHODS SUMMARY Analysis Sets  
All subjects who are enrolled into this study and receive at least one dose of 
study medication will be included in the full analysis set for each study phase. The safety and efficacy data will be primarily analyzed  in the full 
analysis set in each study phase, but additional summaries will be done 
separately for De Novo Subjects and Rollover Subjects. 
Safety Analyses 
The analysis of the safety data will focus on data collected during the LTS 
Phase. In addition, all safety data will be reported separately for the Dose 
Titration Phase. Adverse events wi ll be tabulated according to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by body system and preferred 
term. The AE analysis will focus on the dopaminergic (nausea, vomiting, OH) and oral TEAEs. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the 
overall incidence of TEAEs.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The efficacy endpoints will be analyzed both for the full analysis set and 
separately for Rollover Subjects and for De Novo  Subjects.  
The chang es from baseline in the continuous efficacy endpoints will be 
summarized descriptively. The categorical endpoints will be analyzed using subject counts and percentages.

1 Only De novo subjects will undergo dose titration. Dosing during the Dose Titration Phase must be completed 
within 21 days. The initial LTS Visit (LTS V1) must occur up to 21 days after the final Dose Titration Phase visit.  
2 All screening procedures are to be con ducted within 28 days prior to Titration Visit 1  for De Novo subjects: If 
required by the Investigator, and following receipt of subject consent, the Investigator may review the subject’s 
medical history, BMI, height, weight, vital signs, 12 -Lead ECG (in triplicate) and perform a complete physical 
examination at SV1 to determine if the subject may be eligible for study participation. Procedures performed on 
SV1 will not be repeated at SV2. Screening procedures are to be conducted up to 14 days after complet ion of the 
previous study for Rollover subjects and 5 to 21 days prior to LTS V1.  
3 Adverse event recording and serious adverse event reporting will begin when the subject signs the ICF . 
4 De novo Subjects may be monitored in the clinic overnight before Do sing Titration Visits if such facilities exist 
and the subject consents.  
5 Physical examination to include the following: head -eyes-ears-nose and throat; respiratory system; cardiovascular 
system; gastrointestinal system, including mouth – oral cavity; musculoskeletal system; central and peripheral 
nervous system; and skin. The oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual inspection of the inside 
of each cheek, the inside of the upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the tongu e. Any subject 
who presents with an adverse event involving the oral cavity must be seen by a qualified dermatologist (or 
specialist in a related field ) within 24 hours. The dermatologist (or specialist in a related field ) must examine the 
subject, and provide a consultation report including photographs of the oral cavity (see Section 13.1.7).  
6 De novo subjects will undergo an a bbreviated physical exam to include head -eyes-ears-nose and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and skin; to be done at t  = 0 (just pri or to dosing) and 120 minutes post dosing at TV1 to TV6. 
The oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual inspection of the inside of each cheek, the inside of the upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the tongue.  A window o f +/- 10 minutes is given for 
post-dose abbreviated physical and oropharyngeal examinations during TV1 to TV6.  
7 Months are calculated as 4 weeks.  
8 Both height and weight captured at the Screening Visit (SV2 for De Novo subjects; SV1 for Rollover subjects; and 
SVP2 for CTH -301 Completer subjects) to calculate BMI; only weight captured at all other visits.  
9 Vital signs will be assessed once at the Screening Visit ( SV2 for De Novo subjects; SV1 for Rollover subjects; and 
SVP2 for CTH -301 Completer subjects), all Dose Adjustment Visits, LTS V2 , LTS V7 to LTS V17,  and ET. At 
TV1 to TV6 (De novo subjects) and at LTS V1, LTS V3 , LTS V4, LTS V5, and LTS V6  for all subjects vital signs 
will be assessed at t = 0 minutes (just prior to dosing) and immediately after the 60 minute MDS -UPDRS Part III 
assessment. Blood pressure will be measured in both supine and standing positions (to be measured within 
3 minutes of standing) at all timepoints.  
10 Suggested Sequence of Assessments at Pre- Dose: ECG – Vitals – Patient "OFF"/"ON" status - MDS-UPDRS 
Part III 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 32  25 February 2019 Suggested Sequence of Assessments Post -Dose where conflict arises: MDS -UPDRS Part III - Subject 
"OFF"/"ON" status - ECG – Vitals.  
If a previously scheduled MDS -UPDRS assessment is not complete prior to performing these assessments, it must 
be completed prior to performing any scheduled ECG and/or Vitals.  
11 Triplicate 12 -lead ECG at the Screening Visit ( SV2 for De Novo subjects; SV1 for Rollover subjects; and SVP2 
for CTH-301 Completer subjects); single ECGs at t = 0 (ju st prior to dosing) and approximately 50 minutes post 
dosing at TV1 to TV6 (De novo subjects) and at LTS V1, LTS V3, LTS V4, LTS V5, and LTS V6  for all subjects ; 
single ECG at LTS V2 and ET. 
12 MDS-UPDRS Part III (Motor Function) to be assessed at t = 0 (j ust prior to dosing), 15, 30, 60 and 90  minutes 
post dosing at the Screening Visit (SV2; De Novo subjects only). If the patient does not experience an "ON" within 
90 minutes, the site should record the time when the subject turns "ON" and perform an additi onal MDS -UPDRS 
Part III assessment at this time. MDS -UPDRS Part III (Motor Function) will be assessed at t = 0 (just prior to 
dosing), 15, 30, and 60 minutes post dosing at TV1 to TV6, and LTS V1, LTS V3, LTS V4, LTS V5, and LTS V6 . 
During the Dose Titration Phase only  (De novo subjects only) , these assessments may cease if the subject does not 
experience a full "ON" response within 30 minutes of dosing.  
All Part III assessments will exclude the "Dyskinesia Impact on Part III Ratings " and the Hoehn and Yahr  staging. 
13 Investigator/ subject confirmation of "OFF" or "ON" at SV2 (De Novo subjects only).  
At TV1 to TV6 and LTS V1, LTS V3, LTS V4, LTS V5, and LTS V6, the Investigator will assess "OFF/ON" state 
as part of the MDS -UPDRS Part III assessments, except  at 30 minutes, which will be assessed independent of the 
MDS-UPDRS Part III. During the Dose Titration Phase  (De novo subjects only) , these assessments may cease if 
the patient does not experience a full "ON" response within 30 minutes of dosing.  
At TV1 to TV6 and LTS V1, LTS V3, LTS V4, LTS V5, and LTS V6 , the subject should report: "OFF"/"ON" 
state at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after dosing . 
Subjects should also report the  time to when the study medication is starting to have an effect (if applicable),  and 
time to "OFF" following dosing (if it occurs within 60 minutes of dosing). Note: The timing of this should begin 
when the study medication sublingual film has fully dissolved, and can be recorded using a stopwatch or other 
suitable timing device . 
During the Dose Titration Phase only  (De novo subjects only) , these assessments may cease if the subject does not 
experience a full "ON" response within 30 minutes of dosing.  
14 Dosing in clinic from outpatient supplies.  At LTS V1 De novo Subjects ( only) will receive outpatient self -
administration training.  
15 Sites will call each patient 3 days before an applicable in -clinic LTS visit to remind patients to complete the 
Subject Dosing Diary. Diary will record: time when patient self -administers a dose; subject "ON"/"OFF" status at 
30 minutes following dosing; the type of "OFF" experienced ( ie, morning akinesia; delayed "ON"; wearing "OFF"; 
no "ON"; or sudden "OFF"). At LTS V1, the diary will be collected from De novo Subjects only.  
16 Subject Dosing Diary provided on TV1 (De novo subjects only) will be provided for training purposes only. 
During this phase, subjects should be instructed to use their scheduled PD medication administration as the 
reference point. At LTS V1, the diary will be collected from De novo Subjects. If needed, subjects will be 
retrained on LTS V1 in the use of the dosing diary.  
17 Subject "OFF" versus "ON" Training will occur as part of the L -Dopa challenge at SV2 ( De Novo subjects only). 
18 "Screening " scale to be used at the Screening Vis it (SV2 for De Novo subjects; SV1 for Rollover suubjects; and 
SVP2 for CTH -301 Completer subjects); "Since Last Visit" to be used at all other visits.  
19 –S to be used at first visit, -I to be used at all subsequent visits.  
20 Blood collection for APL -130277 PK analyses will occur in up to 24 subjects from up to 6 sites. Samples will be 
taken at t = 0 (just prior to dosing) and at t = 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes post dosing.  
21 Intentionally skipped.  
22 Assessments will not be performed on  subjects whose participation is terminated during the Dose Titration Phase 
of the study.  
23 Assessment optional; to be completed if caregiver is present and consent is provided.  
24 Excluding LTS V7 for CTH -301 Completer subjects. 
25 At the investigator’s discretion, the subject may receive the adjusted dose in -clinic and undergo efficacy 
(MDS-UPDRS part III and ON/OFF assessments up to 90 minutes), and additional safety assessments as deemed 
appropriate.  
Subjects will be contacted by telephone within 3 days after dose adjustment visits for assessment of effect of the 
dose adjustment and safety .

Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 34  25 February 2019 For De novo subjects, a t all titration visits, at the discretion of the subject and/or Investigator, the 
next highest dose may be evaluated at a subsequent titration visit following a full "ON" response 
in order to assess the potential for the next highest dose in inducing an improved full " ON" 
response. If this dose produces an improved " ON" response relative to the lower dose without 
impacting subject safety and tolerability, the higher dose will be used during the LTS Phase of 
the study. If the " ON" response is the same or worse, or this higher dose is not well- tolerated, the 
previous dose will be used during the LTS Phase of the study.

Confidential and Proprietary 44  25 February 2019 7. INTRODUCTION 
7.1. Background  
Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease aft er Alzheimer’s 
disease. PD has a prevalence of approximately 0.5% to 1% among persons 65 to 69 years of age, 
rising to 1% to 3% among persons 80 years of age and older ( Tanner, 1996 ). The disease is 
characterized by progressive degeneration of the dopamine rgic nigrostriatal system and depletion 
of dopamine, which results in the core motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and 
postural instability ( Hornykiewicz, 2008).  
During the early stages of the disease, motor symptoms are well controlled with L-Dopa plus a 
dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors, dopamine agonists or MAO-B inhibitors. However, as the 
disease progresses, PD patients develop motor complications which consist of dyskinesia and 
motor fluctuations. Motor fluctuations represent periods of "OFF" time and include wearing 
"OFF", delayed "ON" (if with first morning dose termed morning akinesia), unexpected "OFF" or "ON"/"OFF" fluctuations. These motor fluctuations can be either predictable or unpredictable. 
The mechanisms by which response fluctuations occur are only partially understood but are 
thought to include presynaptic neuronal degeneration leading to a lack of buffering of released 
L-Dopa, postsynaptic changes in dopamine receptor sensitivity and number, and 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic influences of exogenously administered dopaminergic agents (Mouradian, 1989; Stocchi, 2005). Fluctuations in plasma levels of L-Dopa occur due to 
the short half- life of L-Dopa and the unpredictable variability of gastric emptying. 
In general, approx imately 40% of patients with PD experience motor fluctuations and/or 
dyskinesias after 4 to 6 years of L -Dopa therapy, with close to 90% of patients experiencing 
these symptoms after 9 or more years of treatment ( Ahlskog, 2001 ). 
Predictable motor fluctuations (ie wearing "OFF") can be treated by increasing the dose or frequency of L -Dopa or by adding adjunctive Parkinson’s disease medications (Catechol 
O-methyltransferase [COMT] inhibitors, MAO -B inhibitors, dopamine agonists). However, over 
time this becomes less effective. Treatment of unpredictable motor fluctuations (ie delayed "ON", Sudden "OFF", "ON"/"OFF" fluctuations) is limited. Some patients take oral L -Dopa 
immediate release as needed but this is of limited value as higher doses of L- Dopa can resu lt in 
dyskinesia and perpetuates the development of further motor complications. 
The only approved treatment for acute management of "OFF" episodes in the United States is 
apomorphine dosed by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection. Although efficacious, s.c. apomorphine has 
limited use due to its parenteral administration and since it may be difficult for a PD patient to deliver. There remains a huge unmet medical need for easy to administer, rapid, safe, effective 
and reliable rescue medications for the treatment of these "OFF" episodes in PD patients. 
APL-130277, sublingually administered apomorphine, provides a more patient-friendly, easy to 
administer medication for the management of both predictable and unpredictable "OFF" 
episodes. 
Apomorphine is a non- ergot dopamine agonist that binds to D
1-like and D 2-like receptors. First 
used as a treatment for PD as early as 1951, its clinical use was first reported in 1970 although its 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 45  25 February 2019 emetic properties and short half- life made oral use impractical. A later study found th at 
combining the drug with 10 mg domperidone improved results significantly 
(APOMORPHINE,  1949; Cotzias, 1970; Corsini, 1979; Millan, MJ; Schwab, 1951).  
APOKYN®/APO-go® (apomorphine hydrochloride injection, see Section  19.1) are prescription 
medicines that reverses "OFF" episodes (end -of-dose wearing -"OFF" and unpredictable 
"ON"-"OFF" episodes) associated with advancing PD. APOKYN®/APO-go®, which are 
indicated for the acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, " OFF" episodes associated with 
advanced PD, have been studied as an adjunct to other PD medications. 
Therapeutic use in PD is effective because of the drug's strong dopaminergic action. When 
administered subcutaneously, apomorphine is the most effective dopamine agonist. Within 3 to 
20 minutes of injection, apomorphine demonstrates a magnitude of effect (ability to convert the 
patients with PD to the "ON" state) that is comparable to L -Dopa. The effects of a single 
s.c. injection last for approximately 60  minutes. Apomorphine can be used in combination with 
L-Dopa. L-Dopa dosing may need to be readjusted (decreased) to reduce dopa-induced 
dyskinesias periods (APOMORPHINE, 1949; Cotzias, 1970; Corsini, 1979; Millan, MJ; Schwab, 1951). 
Subcutaneous injection of apomorphine was developed to avoid first- pass metabolism as 
apomorphine is almost completely metabolized when delivered orally (between 1- 2% of the total 
dose enters the bloodstream following oral administration). The total daily dose of 
s.c. apomorphine can range up to 20-25 mg/daily. Domperidone, a peripheral dopamine 
antagonist, may be administered to avoid emesis, bradycardia and hypotension caused by 
apomorphine’s peripheral dopaminergic action. Patients on chronic apomorphine treatment may 
be able to  discontinue domperidone co- administration after about 2  months without recurrence of 
the dopaminergic adverse effects of apomorphine. Domperidone is not available in the US, 
where trimethobenzamide is used.  
7.2. Drug Substance  
 
The active ingredient is apomorphine hydrochloride hemihydrate (C 17H17NO2•HCl•½H 2O(salt)). 
Apomorphine is synthesized from morphine, but it is not a narcotic, nor is it a controlled 
substance. Apomorphine hydrochloride appears as minute, white or greyish- white glistening 
crystals or white powder. The R -enantiomer is used clinically.  
The drug substance, apomorphine hydrochloride hemihydrate is manufactured by Sanofi-Chemie. Apomorphine hydrochloride is manufactured from morphine monohydrate in the 
presence of orthophosphoric acid, ethyl acetate and hydrochloric acid. Purification is performed in the presence of water, sodium chloride, sodium sulfite, ethyl acetate and silica gel. 
A summary of physico -chemical data are provided in Table 8.

7.3. Drug Product (APL-130277 Sublingual Film)  
The product under development, APL-130277, is a soluble film for sublingual administration. 
APL-130277 is designed to deliver apomorphine systemically through absorption from the oral 
cavity mucosa, thus bypassing the extensive first pass metabolism associated with 
gastrointestinal absorption of the compound. APL -130277 can be administered without regard to 
food status (ie, either fed or fasted). The product is intended to be an al ternative to the injectable 
form of apomorphine hydrochloride, which is marketed as APOKYN® and as APO -go®. 
APL-130277 is manufactured for clinical studies as a bilayer film with one layer containing the 
active ingredient, apomorphine hydrochloride, and the other layer containing a buffer, pyridoxine. Dosage units of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg are achieved from a single formulation by cutting different sized rectangular films from sheets of bulk film as shown in the table below. Identifying marks are printed  in white ink on the buffer (pyridoxine) side of the sublingual film.

The 35 mg dose will be administered by dosing with the 20 mg sublingual film, and after 
3 minutes have elapsed, followed by dosing with a 15 mg sublingu al film. 
The APL-130277 drug product will be manufactured and packaged at ARx, LLC facilities at: 
400 Seaks Run Road, Glen Rock, PA 17327, USA and Tapemark Company facilities at: 1685 Marthaler Lane, West St. Paul, MN 55118, USA. 
The formulations for each of the dosage strengths have exactly the same proportions of active 
pharmaceutical ingredient and inactive excipients.  
The formulation consists of pharmaceutically acceptable cellulosic film formers along with glycerin as a plasticizer; and flavor, sweetener and color additives for patient acceptability.  Other 
excipients include sodium hydroxide to modify pH and sodium metabisulfite as an antioxidant/preservative. The formulation also includes pyridoxine HCl as a buffer 
component. The excipients used in for mulating APL -130277 sublingual films, are compendial 
(USP, NF or FCC) items and/or are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and/or have precedent for use in pharmaceutical products approved in the US. 
7.4. Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits  
Given that APL-130277 uses the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) as 
APOKYN®/APO-go®, and that the pharmacokinetic profile is comparable between the 
sublingual film and the s.c. injection, the risks associated with the drug will be similar to those 
seen in the AP OKYN®/APO-go® prescribing information (see Section 19.1), except for the 
significant injection site reactions, which are associated with the mode of administration  for 
APOKYN®/APO-go®. It is assumed that the bioava ilability of APL -130277 will be consistent in 
CTH-301 with that found in previous experience with APL-130277 compared with 
APOKYN®/APO-go®. 
The buffer contained in the inactive layer of APL-130277 is designed to mitigate potential irritation of the oral mu cosa seen in other buccal formulations of apomorphine as well as assist in 
maintaining a stable pH and optimal absorption kinetics. A preclinical hamster study demonstrated no evidence of microscopic or macroscopic irritation but i n clinical studies with 
APL-130277, adverse event reports of irritation of the oral mucosa have been observed. The 
current study will closely monitor for this potential AE. 
The goal of this development program, however, is to formulate a medication that provides the PD patient with an easier delivery system. It is hypothesized that a sublingually administered 
formulation may be easier to use, allow more effective and safer control over predicted "OFF" 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 48  25 February 2019 periods, be more readily accessible to the patient when unpredicted "OFF" episodes occur during 
activities of daily living, and potentially be used by the milder PD patient when "OFF" episodes 
begin during the advancement of the disease. 
7.5. Rationale  
This multi- center, Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate the long- term efficacy, safety and 
tolerability of APL -130277 in subjects with PD who experience motor fluctuations ("OFF" 
episodes). "OFF" episodes are frequently seen in PD patients who receive chronic treatment with L-Dopa, and can be a source of disability. Additional doses of L- Dopa may not be effective 
because of a long -duration to benefit, or no response at all. A treatment that rapidly and reliably 
turns patients "ON" is an important unmet medical need in PD.  
Single doses of APL-130277 for the treatment of "OFF" episodes experienced by subjects with 
PD have been previously investigated in both a healthy and PD population, however, a long- term 
study testing multiple treatments of APL -130277 in both an in- clinic and outpatient setting has 
not been performed. Such a study will provide long-term information on the effect of APL-130277 on "OFF" episodes based on physician and subject assessment in a controlled 
clinical setting, and based on subject evaluations in an outpatient setting. This study will provide 
information on treating "OFF " episodes in a PD subject population, assessing the drug in a 
manner in which it will be recommended for regular clinical use. The study is thus designed to primarily investigate the long -term safety and tolerability of APL -130277 in acutely treating 
"OFF" episodes (eg, morning akinesia, wearing "OFF", dose failure, sudden "OFF").

Confidential and Proprietary 51  25 February 2019 10. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multi- center, open -label, Phase 3 study in L-Dopa responsive PD subjects with motor 
fluctuations, designed to evaluate the long- term safety, tolerability, and effic acy of APL -130277. 
10.1. General Overview  
This study will be an open-label, long- term safety study of APL -130277 for the treatment of  up 
to 5 "OFF" episodes per day. Subjects will return to the clinic at regular intervals for assessments 
as defined in the schedule of assessments (see Tables 2 -7). Subjects  may participate in the study 
until the Sponsor terminates the study, or until commercial availability of APL -130277 in the 
subject’s country. 
10.1.1. Screening Visits  
10.1.1.1. Screening Procedures for De Novo Subjects  
De Novo subjects are defined as subjects who have not previously participated in a study with 
APL-130277. 
Before any study procedures are performed on any subject , informed consent must be obtained at 
an initial Screening Visit (SV1). If required by the Investigator , and following receipt of patient 
consent, the Investigator may review the subject’s medical history, BMI, height, weight, vital 
signs, 12- Lead ECG (in triplicate) and perform a complete physical examination at SV1 to 
determine if the patient may be eligible for study participation and continuation onto the second 
Screening Visit (SV2). Subjects recruited to participate in the study, and who have provided full 
consent to participate, will be asked to attend the second Screening Visit (SV2), and will be 
instructed to arrive at the clinic after their usual morning dose of PD medications; but before 
taking their next dose of medication. Their normal morning dose of L- Dopa (without adjunctive 
PD medication) will be administered in the clinic approximately two hours after their normally 
scheduled second dose of PD medication, following confirmation of an " OFF" episode by the 
Investigator, to ensure that they experience a full  "ON" response. Eligibility criteria will be 
assessed and subject "ON" /"OFF" training will be performed (see Section 12.11.3.1).  
Subjects who fail the screening process will be allowed to rescreen once if agreed by the Medical 
Monitor. 
10.1.1.2. Screening Procedures for Rollover Subjects 
Rollover subjects are defined as subjects who have previously completed any of the following 
studies: CTH -201, CTH-203, CTH-300, or CTH -302. 
Rollover Subjects will be required to attend the Screening Visit and  applicable eligibility 
assessments will be performed. This visit will occur up to up to 14 days after the final visit of the 
previous study. Subjects will present to clinic following their normal PD medication regimen and 
should not withhold any of their normal PD medications. Screening assessments will be 
performed while  subjects are in the “ON” state.  
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 52  25 February 2019 Eligibility criteria will be assessed and eligible subjects will be asked to return to the clinic in the 
morning of Long- term Safety Visit 1 (LTS V1).  
Subjects will begin treatment at the last APL -130277 dose level they were taking in the previous 
study. These subjects will not undergo titration. If during the screening visit (prior to LTS V1), 
the Investigator determines a dose adjustment is necessary, the subject will have dose adjustment 
visits. 
Subjects who fail the screening process will be allowed to rescreen once if agreed by the Medical Monitor. 
Evaluation of subjects who choose to withdraw from the study at any time will be conducted in 
accordance with Section 12.8, Early Terminations.  
10.1.1.3. Screening Procedures for CTH -301 Completer Subjects 
CTH-301 Completer subjects are defined as subjects who have previously completed the 
CTH-301 study under protocol version 3.00. 
Subjects who previously completed the CTH- 301 study and are re -enrolling into CTH-301 will 
be required to a ttend the Screening Visit Phase 2 (SVP2) and applicable eligibility assessments 
will be performed. Re- enrolling patients will present to clinic following their normal PD 
medication regimen and should not withhold any of their normal PD medications. 
Eligibility criteria will be assessed and once a subject is deemed eligible, the site will contact the 
subject to have them return to the clinic 5 to 28 days later and follow study procedures beginning 
at LTS Visit 7. These subjects will resume treatment with APL -130277 at the dose he/she was 
administered prior to completing CTH -301. If this dose is no longer considered tolerable or 
effective, the subject will return to the clinic for dose adjustment visits until a  new tolerable or 
effective dose is established.  
Subjects who fail the screening process will be allowed to rescreen once if agreed by the Medical 
Monitor. 
10.1.2. Dose Titration Phase - De Novo Subjects Only 
On Titration Visit 1 (TV1), subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinic after their usual morning 
dose of PD medications; but before taking their next dose of medication. Subjects will be 
required to wait approximately two hours after their normally scheduled dose of PD medications 
and following confirmation by both the Investigator and patient that they a re in the "OFF" state, 
subjects will be treated with 10 mg APL-130277. Efficacy (MDS- UPDRS Part III) will be 
performed prior to dosing, and at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after dosing. Safety assessments 
(AE, vital signs [including supine and standing BP to assess OH ]) will be performed prior to 
dosing, and immediately after the 60 minute MDS -UPDRS Part III assessment.  
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be obtained prior to dosing and approximately 50 minutes after 
dosing. 
Subjects who respond to the APL-130277 10 mg  dose with a full "ON" response within 
45 minutes at TV1, as assessed by  both the patient and Investigator, will be considered complete 
from a Dose Titration Phase perspective, and can proceed to the LTS Phase of the study. These 
subjects will be aske d to return to the clinic for LTS V1. A full " ON", as assessed by the subject, 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 53  25 February 2019 is defined as: a period of time where medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, 
stiffness and slowness and where a subject feels he/she can perform normal daily a ctivities; AND 
the response is comparable to or better than their normal response to PD medications prior to 
enrolling in the study (refer to Section  12.11.3.1). A full "ON", as determined by the Investigator 
is defined as: per clinical judgement, the period of time where the Investigator feels the 
medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, stiffness and slowness and the subject has adequate motor function to allow them to perform their normal daily activities (refer to 
Section 12.11.3.1). 
Subjects who develop symptoms such as nausea and/or vomiting which warrant treatment may 
receive anti -emetic therapy (US sites – Tigan
® [trimethobenzamide hydrochloride; 300 mg t.i.d.]; 
non US sites – domperidone [10 mg b.i.d.]). If initiated, anti-emetic therapy should be stopped when clinically indicated . Anti-emetic medication should not be administered prophylactically. 
Subjects who do not achieve a full " ON" response ( as defined in  Section 12.11.3.1) within 
45 minutes with their 10 mg APL-130277 dose will restart their normal PD medications and will 
be asked to return to the clinic within the next 3 days for Titration Visit 2 (TV2), to assess the 
next highest dose ( ie, 15 mg) in a manner identical to that on Titration Visit 1 (TV1), with 
identical evaluations .  
All subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinic after their usual morning dose of PD 
medications; but before taking their next dose of medication. Subjects will be required to wait 
approximately two hours after their normally scheduled second dose of PD medications before being dosed with 15 mg  APL-130277. Subjects who achieve a full "ON" (as defined in 
Section 12.11.3.1) within 45 minutes of receiving the 15 mg dose will be considered complete 
from a Dose Titration Phase perspective, and can proceed to the LTS Phase.  Subjects who do not 
achieve a full "ON" response (as defined in Section  12.11.3.1) within 45 minutes of dosing at 
TV2 will restart their standard PD medications and be asked to return to the clinic within the 
next 3 days to assess the next higher dose of APL-130277 (20 mg [TV3] , 25 mg [TV4], 30 mg 
[TV5], or 35 mg  [TV6], as appropriate). For subjects dosed with 35 mg, the first sublingual film 
(ie, 20 mg) will be placed under the tongue for 3 minutes before placing the second sublingual 
film (ie, 15  mg) under the tongue im mediately after and without delay.  
For each visit in the Dose Titration Phase, the site will arrange subject transfers, if needed. 
Alternatively, subjects may be monitored in the clinic overnight if such facilities exist and the 
subject consents. These occurrences will not be considered a SAE. Safety and efficacy 
assessments will be performed at each visit exactly as described above. Subjects who achieve a full "ON" response at any titration visit may proceed to  the LTS Phase.  
At all titration visits, at th e discretion of the subject and/or Investigator, the next highest dose 
may be evaluated at a subsequent titration visit following a full "ON" response in order to assess 
the potential for the next highest dose in inducing an improved full " ON" response. If  this dose 
produces an improved " ON" response relative to the lower dose without impacting subject safety 
and tolerability, the higher dose will be used during the LTS Phase of the study. If the "ON" 
response is the same or worse, or this higher dose is not well-tolerated, the previous dose will be used during the LTS Phase of the study. 
During the Dose Titration Phase visits, if in the opinion of the Investigator the subject can no 
longer tolerate the "OFF" state at any point during the Visit, the patient may receive rescue 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 54  25 February 2019 L-Dopa (± other adjunctive PD medication) at a dosage considered appropriate by the 
Investigator to achieve a full "ON" state. If this occurs, subjects can return to the clinic on 
another day to resume the titration with the next highest dose. If a dose of APL- 130277 cannot 
be found that provided a full " ON" response, the subject will be terminated from the study.  
In this study, the minimum titration dose is 1 0 mg APL-130277 and the maximum titration dose 
is 35 mg APL-130277. Any subjects  who reach 35 mg  at Titration Visit 6 (TV6) and do not 
exhibit a full "ON" response (as defined in Section  12.11.3.1) within 45 minutes will be 
terminated from the study and will have the applicable procedures outlined in the Early 
Termination  Visit performed.  
Dosing days in the Dose Titration Phase are not required to occur consecutively , but the Dose 
Titration Phase must be completed within 21 days. Following completion of the titration phase, 
subjects will return to clinic for LTS V1 where they will be given their open- label study 
medication (APL -130277) and appropriate training for self- administration.  
Titration in this study may be modified following a review of the Dose Titration Phase data from 
CTH-300 by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). If, after review of the data from 
CTH-300, the DSMB determines that in- clinic titration is not necessary  and that dose titration 
can be safely accomplished in an outpatient setting, the Dose Titration Phase paradigm ma y be 
modified. 
Evaluation of subjects who choose to withdraw from the study at any time will be conducted in 
accordance with Section 12.8, Early Terminations. 
10.1.3. Long-Term Safety Phase Year 1 – In-clinic Visits  – De Novo and Rollover 
Subjects Only 
De novo s ubjects who successfully completed the Dose Titration Phase of the study will be 
asked to return to the clinic on LTS V1 where they will be given their dose of APL-130277. This 
visit will occur between up to 21 day s after the final visit in the Dose Titration Phase of the 
study. The dose given will be the same as that determined during the Dose Titration Phase of the 
study. 
Rollover subjects who successfully completed the Screening visit (SV1) will return to the clinic on LTS Day 1 up to 21 days after SV1. These subjects will receive the same dose they received in the previous study. 
All subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinic after their usual morning dose of PD 
medications; but before taking their next dose of medication. Subjects will be required to wait approximately two hours after their normally scheduled second dose of PD medications. 
Following a confirmed "OFF" state by both the subject and the Investigator, subjects will be 
dosed with their study medic ation and assessments of efficacy and safety will be performed for 
up to 90 minutes after dosing. During this visit, subjects will be trained by clinic staff on how to 
remove study medication from its packaging and how to self-administer their dose using placebo treatment sublingual films supplied to the site. Subjects should not  self-administer the placebo 
sublingual films. Subjects cannot be discharged from clinic until satisfactorily completing the 
training. 
At the in-clinic visits, staff will dose subjects with APL -130277 by placing the sublingual 
film under the subject’s tongue (see Section 14.2 for full dosing details). Subjects will be 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 55  25 February 2019 asked to follow the same process of study drug administration during the at -home portions 
of the study.  
During LTS Phase Year 1 of the study, subjects will return to the clinic at 4 weeks for LTS 
Visit 2 (LTS V2), 12 weeks for LTS Visit  3 (LTS V3), 24 weeks for LTS Visit  4 (LTS V4), 
36 weeks for LTS Visit 5 (LTS V5), and 48 weeks  for LTS Visit 6 (LTS V6). At LTS  V3, 
LTS V4, LTS V5, and LTS V6, subjects will be dosed with APL-130277 and the procedures 
performed at these visits will be similar to those performed on LTS V1. LTS V2 will be a safety visit only. 
At the LTS in -clinic visits where the subject is dosed with APL-130277, if in the opinion of the 
Investigator the subject can no longer tolerate the " OFF" state at any point during the visit, the 
subject may receive rescue L -Dopa (± other adjunctive PD medication) at a dosage considered 
appropriate by the Investigator to achieve a full " ON" state. Where possible, administration of 
rescue L-Dopa should be delayed until after the 90  minute efficacy assessments are complete.  
Following LTS V6, subject will be asked to return to the clinic approximately 4 months 
(16 weeks ± 1 week)  later for LTS Visit 7 (LTS  V7). 
Evaluation of subjects who choose to withdraw from the study at any time will be conducted in 
accordance with Section 12.8, Early Te rminations.  
All PD medications must remain stable during LTS Phase Year 1, and any changes should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and approved by the Medical Monitor. Changes in 
medications for the treatment of other medical disorders are allowed with permission from the 
Medical Monitor. 
10.1.4. Long-Term Safety Phase Year 1 – At Home Assessments  – De Novo  and Rollover 
Subjects Only 
During LTS Phase Year  1, subjects will be instructed to continue with their regular PD 
medication regimen(s), but they should dose themselves with their study treatment 
(APL-130277) if they experience an "OFF" episode (eg, morning akinesia, wearing "OFF", dose 
failure, sudden "OFF", etc.) while on their current treatment regimen. Subjects will be instructed 
to dose up to 5 "OFF" e pisodes per day. Subjects will be instructed to wait a minimum of 2  hours 
between doses taken at home.  
For 2 days prior the in-clinic visits, subjects will be requested to complete a home dosing diary 
that captures:  
• Time of randomized treatment self -administration; 
• Subject "ON"/"OFF" state at 30  minutes after dosing. 
• The type of "OFF" experienced (ie, morning akinesia; delayed "ON"; wearing "OFF"; 
no "ON"; or sudden "OFF"). 
Between each in -clinic visit, subjects will be contacted at the midpoint between visits by the site 
to assess subject well -being and safety. If required due to safety concerns or lack of efficacy, 
subjects will be asked to return to the clinic for additional evaluations at an unscheduled Dose Adjustment Visit. These visits will be classif ied as unscheduled visits.

8. Early Termination Visit (All subjects) 
12.1. Screening Visits  
12.1.1. Screening Procedures for De Novo Subjects  
De Novo Patients are defined as patients who have not previously participated in a study with 
APL-130277. 
Subjects must sign an ICF before any screening -related procedures are performed at an initial 
Screening Visit (SV1).  
Following receipt of subject consent, the subject will be asked to return to the clinic for the 
second Screening Visit (SV2). All screening assessments must be performed within 28 days before Titration Visit 1 (TV1).  
If required by the Investigator, and following receipt of subject consent, the Inves tigator may 
review the patient’s  medical history, BMI, height, weight, vital signs, 12-Lead ECG (in 
triplicate) and perform a complete physical examination at SV1 to determine if the subject may 
be eligible for study participation. If these assessments are done at  SV1, the remaining 
procedures outlined below for SV2, including the assessment of L-Dopa responsiveness, will only be performed. 
The following procedures will be performed by study staff at SV2: 
• Register the visit in the IWRS to obtain the subject screening number. 
• Review inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Review restriction criteria.  
• Record demographics and detailed medical history, including review of medications 
taken within 6 months prior to the initial Screening Visit (SV1), current treatment 
regimens, drug, alcohol and smoking history. 
• Perform a complete physical examination, including an oropharyngeal examination. The oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual inspection of the inside of each cheek, the inside of the upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the tongue. 
• Measure height and weight; calculate BMI.  
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 68  25 February 2019 • Record vital signs (BP, HR, RR and body temperature). Vital signs should be 
measured after the subject has been resting in the supine position for at least 3 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate will be taken again after standing for 2 to 
4 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of BP and HR. If the 
subject is unable to stand due to orthostatic symptoms such as light-headedness, dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing, every attempt should be made to obtain BP and HR in the sitting position. 
• Perform a standard 12 -lead ECG in triplicate.  
• Collect blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis and serology). Serum pregnancy for females of child -bearing potential 
only. The total volume of blood collected will not exceed 25 mL.  
• Perform a MMSE.  
• Assess subject using the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale ( for a sample, see 
Section 19.3). 
• Assess subject using MDS- UPDRS Parts I, II and IV ( for a sample, see Section 19.4). 
• Assess subject motor function using MDS- UPDRS Part III at t = 0 (just prior to 
L-Dopa administration), 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after L -Dopa administration ( for a 
sample, see Section  19.4). If the subject does not experience an " ON" within 
90 minutes of dosing, the site should record the time when the subject turns "ON" and 
perform an additional MDS- UPDRS Part III assessment at this time.  
• Confirm L -Dopa responsiveness. Subjects will take their normal dose of L -Dopa 
without their normal adjunctive PD medication.  
• Investigator confirmation of " OFF" or "ON". 
• Perform subject training in order to distingu ish "OFF" versus " ON" episodes (see 
Section 12.11.3.1).  
• Assess suicidal ideation using C- SSRS (for a sample, see Section  19.6). The 
"Screening " scale should be used at this visit. 
• Provide the subject with the PDQ -39 to complete ( for a sample, see Section  19.7). 
• Provide the subject with the EQ -5D (for a sample, see Section  19.13). 
• Assess using the ESS ( for a sample, see Section 19.10). 
• Assess caregiver burden using the ZBI ( for a sample, see Section  19.11). 
• Complete the  QUIP-RS (for a sample, see Section  19.12). 
• Begin adverse event recording and serious adverse event reporting when the subject 
signs the ICF. 
• Begin recording of any new concomitant medications and/or changes to current 
concomitant medications being used by the subject.

The Investigator will review all information obtained from the scre ening procedures. If the 
subject is not eligible, the subject will be a screening failure from SVP2 and will not attend any 
other visits. Subjects who fulfill all entry criteria and found eligible to participate in the study 
will be asked to return to clin ic 5 to 28 days later and follow study procedures beginning at LTS 
Visit 7. These subjects will resume treatment with APL -130277 at the dose he/she was 
administered prior to completing CTH -301. If this dose is no longer considered tolerable or 
effective, the subject will return to the clinic for dose adjustment visits until a new tolerable or 
effective dose is established.  
12.2. Dose Titration Phase (TV1 to TV6)  - De Novo Subjects Only 
12.2.1. TV1 to TV6  
On the day of these visits, subjects will be asked to come to the clinic having taken their usual 
morning PD medication; but before taking their next dose of PD medications. The subjects will 
be required to wait approximately two hours after their normally scheduled second dose of PD 
medications.  If needed, the site will arrange subject transfers.  
Doses of APL -130277 will be administered as follows during the Dose Titration Phase: 
• Titration Visit 1 (TV1) – 10 mg APL -130277;

• Titration Visit 6 (TV6) – 35 mg APL -130277 (administered as a 20 mg sublingual 
film and 15 mg sublingual film, sequentially).  
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 72  25 February 2019 Subjects who develop symptoms such as nausea and/or vomiting which warrant treatment may 
receive anti -emetic therapy (US sites – Tigan® [trimethobenzamide hydrochloride; 300 mg 
t.i.d.]; non- US sites – domperidone [10 mg b.i.d.]). If initiated, anti-emetic therapy should be 
stopped when clinically indicated. Anti -emetic medication should not be administered 
prophylactically.  
Site staff will perform the  following  procedures on each Titration Visit:  
• Register the visit in IWRS to enroll the subject in the Titration Phase and obtain the 
Titration kit number (TV1 only).  
• Review restriction criteria.  
• Perform an abbreviated physical examination, including oropharyngeal examination, prior to dosing and 2 hours post dosing. The oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual inspection of the inside of each cheek, the inside of the upper 
and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the tongue. A window of 
+/- 10 minutes is given for post-dose abbreviated physical and oropharyngeal 
examinations during TV1 to TV6. 
• Record vital signs (BP, HR, RR and body temperature). Vital signs should be 
measured after the subject has been resting in the supine position for at least 
3 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate will be taken again after standing for 2 to 4 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of BP and HR. If the 
subject is unable to stand due to orthostatic symptoms such as light-headedness, 
dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing, every attempt should be made to obtain BP and HR in the sitting position. 
• Perform a standard 12 -lead ECG prior to dosing and approximately 50 minutes after 
dosing. 
• Assess subject motor function using MDS- UPDRS Part III at t  = 0 (just prior to 
dosing), 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after dosing (for a sample, see Section 19.4). 
During the Dose Titration Phase only, these assessments may cease if the patient does not experience a full "ON" response within 45 minutes of dosing. 
• If subjects are in the "OFF" state, dose with APL-130277. 
• Investigator confirmation of " OFF" or "ON". Investigator will assess "OFF"/"ON" 
state as part of the MDS -UPDRS Part III assessments , except at 45  minutes, which 
will be assessed independent of the MDS- UPDRS Part III . The subject must be in an 
"OFF" state prior to dosing in order to proceed with dosing. During the Dose 
Titration Phase only, these assessments may cease if the subject does not experience a full "ON" response within 45 minutes of dosing. 
• Subject confirmation of "OFF" or "ON". Subject should report: "OFF"/"ON" state at 
t = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes after dosing.  
• Subject should also report time to when the study medication is starting to have an 
effect (if applicable), and time to "OFF" following dosing (if it occurs within 90 minutes of dosing). Note: The timing of this should begin when the study 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 73  25 February 2019 medication sublingual film has fully dissolved, and can be recorded using a stopwatch 
or other suitable timing device.  
• Provide subject with a home dosing diary (TV1 only; see Section  19.5). Diary will be 
provided for training purposes only. If needed, subject will be retrained at LTS V1 in 
the use of the home dosing diary. 
• Assess suicidal ideation using C- SSRS (for a sample, see Section 19.6). "Since Last 
Visit" version should be used at these visits. 
• Record any AEs/SAEs that have occurred since the last subject visit. 
• Record any new concomitant medications and/or changes to current concomitant medications being used by the subject since the last visit.  
Subjects who respond to an APL-130277 dose with a full " ON" response within 45 minutes of 
dosing at any Titration Visit, will be considered complete from a Dose Titration Phase perspective and may proceed to the LTS Phase. This dose will be used in the LTS Phase of the 
study. Sites should enter all titration MDS -UPDRS Part III data for the patient into the CRF 
within 48 hours of the last titration visit for review by the Medical Monitor. NOT E: At all 
titration visits, at the discretion of the subject and/or Investigator, the next  highest dose may be 
evaluated at a subsequent titration visit following a full "ON" response in order to assess the 
potential for the next highest dose in inducing an improved full " ON" response. If this dose 
produces an i mproved " ON" response relative the lower dose without impacting subject safety 
and tolerability , the higher dose will be used during the LTS Phase of the study.  If the "ON" 
response is the same or worse, or this higher dose is not well- tolerated, the previous dose will be 
used during the LTS Phase of the study. 
A full "ON" is defined in Section  12.11.3.1. 
Subjects who do not achieve a complete and full " ON" response within 45 minutes with the 
APL-130277 dose given will be asked to return to clinic within the next 3  days for their 
subsequent Titration Visit, to assess the next highest dose in a manner identical to that on Titration Visit 1 (TV1).  
At any point in the visit, subjects in the "OFF" state who, in the op inion of the Investigator, can no 
longer tolerate their "OFF" state may receive rescue L -Dopa (± other adjunctive PD medication) 
at a dosage considered appropriate by the Investigator to achieve an " ON" state. If this occurs, 
subjects can return to the clinic on another day to resume the titration with the next highest dose. 
If a dose of APL -130277 cannot be found that provides a full " ON" response, the subject will be 
terminated from the study.  
12.3. Long-Term Safety (LTS) Treatment Phase Year 1 – De Novo and 
Rollover Subjects Only 
The long-term safety phase year 1 of the study will consist of 2 parts –in -clinic assessments and 
at-home assessments. The former will consist of 6 in -clinic visits where formal assessments of 
efficacy and/or safety will be performed. The latter will be an at- home self -administration, where 
all subjects will be instructed to self -administer their doses of APL -130277 in order to treat up to 
5 "OFF" episodes (ie, morning akinesia; delayed "ON"; wearing "OFF"; no "ON"; or sudden 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 74  25 February 2019 "OFF") per  day. Subjects will be instructed to wait a minimum of 2  hours between each dose 
taken at home.  
De novo Subjects who have successfully completed the Dose Titration Phase of the study will 
receive their dose of open -label study treatment on LTS V1. The dose given will be the same as 
that determined during the Dose Titration Phase of the study. 
 
Rollover subjects will receive treatment with the same dose they were on in the previous study.

Long-Term Safety  Visit 1 (LTS V1) may occur no later than 21 days after the last Dose Titration 
Phase visit  for De novo subjects, or no later than 21  days after Screening for Rollover subjects.  
Subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinic after their usual morning dose of PD medications; 
but before taking their next dose of medication. Subjects will be required to wait approximately 
two hours after their normally scheduled second dose of PD medications. 
The following  procedures will take place at these visit s except where explicitly noted:

Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic having taken their usual morning PD medications. 
The following safety assessments will be conducted: 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 84  25 February 2019 • Review restriction criteria.  
• Perform a complete physical examination, including oropharyngeal examination prior 
to dosing. The oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual inspection of the inside of each cheek, the inside of the upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the tongue. 
• Measure weight.  
• Record vital signs (BP, HR, RR and body temperature). Vital signs should be 
measured after the subject has been resting in the sup ine position for at least 
3 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate will be taken again after standing for 2 to 
4 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of BP and HR. If the 
subject is unable to stand due to orthostatic symptoms such as light-headedness, 
dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing, every attempt should be made to obtain BP and HR in the sitting position. 
• Perform a standard 12 -lead ECG.  
• Collect blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemis try 
and urinalysis). Serum pregnancy for females of child-bearing potential only. Blood collected for this evaluation will not exceed 20  mL. 
• Register the visit in the IWRS to obtain the study medication kit numbers.  
• Dispense Study Medication assigned by the IWRS for Outpatient Dosing . 
• Collect Study Medication . 
• Provide subject with a home dosing diary (see Section 19.5). 
• Collect subject's previous home dosing diary (see Section 19.5) . Verify that the diary 
has been appropriately completed and retrain subject on diary completion as necessary.  
• Perform IP accountability and a ssess treatment compliance.  
• Assess suicidal ideation using C- SSRS (for a sample, see Section 19.6). "Sin ce Last 
Visit" version should be used at this visit. 
• Record any AEs/SAEs that have occurred since the last subject visit.  
• Record any new concomitant medications and/or changes to current concomitant medications being used by the subject since the last visi t. 
12.7.2. LTS Phase Year 5 – At Home Assessments  
During the LTS Phase, subjects will be instructed to continue with their regular PD medication regimen(s), but should dose themselves with their APL-130277 treatment if they experience an "OFF" episode (eg, morning akinesia, wearing "OFF", dose failure, sudden "OFF", etc.) while on 
their current treatment regimen. Subjects will be instructed to dose up to 5 "OFF" episodes per 
day. Subjects will be instructed to wait a minimum of 2  hours between each dose taken at home.  
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 85  25 February 2019 For 2 days prior to in- clinic visits, subjects will be requested to complete a dosing diary (for a 
sample, see Section 19.5) that captures:  
• Time of APL -130277 treatment self- administration; 
• Subject "ON"/"OFF" state at 30  minutes after dosing; 
• The type of "OFF" experienced (ie, morning akinesia; delayed "ON"; wearing "OFF"; 
no "ON"; or sudden "OFF"). 
Subjects will complete this diary for every self -administration they perform on each of these 
2 days. Clinic staff will call each subject approximately 3  days prior to the in -clinic visits in 
order to remind subjects to complete their home dosing diary. Subjects should be reminded to 
document when they dose themselves and to accurately report their "ON"/"OFF" status at 
30 minutes after dosing.  
12.7.3. LTS Phase Year 5 – Telephone Contacts  
Sites will follow -up with subjects at the mid -point between each in -clinic visit in order to assess 
study medication compliance, subject safety and well -being. If needed, an unscheduled Dos e 
Adjustment Visit will be scheduled with the subject in order to further assess safety and 
well-being. 
The following safety assessments will be conducted: 
• Reconfirm consent. 
• Review restriction criteria.  
• Record any AEs/SAEs that have occurred since the las t patient visit.  
• Record any new concomitant medications and/or changes to current concomitant medications being used by the patient since the last visit.  
12.8. Early Termination  Visit 
 
Every effort should be made to have subjects complete all study visits. The following 
assessments will be conducted when an individual subject discontinues: 
• Perform a complete physical examination, including oropharyngeal examination, 
prior to dosing. The oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual 
inspection of the inside of each cheek, the inside of the upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the tongue. 
• Measure weight.  
• Record vital signs (BP, HR, RR and body temperature). Vital signs should be measured after the subject has been resting in the supin e position for at least 
3 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate will be taken again after standing for 2 to 4 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of BP and HR. If the subject is unable to stand due to orthostatic symptoms such as l ight-headedness, 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277

obtain BP and HR in the sitting position. 
• Perform a standard 12 -lead ECG.  
• Collect blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistr y 
and urinalysis). Serum pregnancy for females of child-bearing potential only. Blood collected for this evaluation will not exceed 20  mL. 
• Assess suicidal ideation using C- SSRS (for a sample, see Section 19.6). 
• Record any AEs/SAEs that have occurred since the last subject visit.  
• Record any new concomitant medications and/or changes to current concomitant 
medications being used by the subject since the last visit.  
Subjects who discontinue the study during the LTS Phase will also have the following 
assessments performed:  
• Collect outpatient supplies (if applicable). 
• Collect Subject Dosing Diary (if applicable).  
• Assess treatment compliance (if applicable).  
• Provide the subject with the PDQ-39 to complete (for a sample, see Section 19.7). 
• Ask subject to complete the PGI- I (for a sample, see Section 19.9). 
• Complete the CGI -I (for a sample, see Section 19.8). 
• Assess using the ESS (for a sample, see Section 19.10). 
• Assess caregiver burden using the ZBI (for a sample, see Section 19.11). 
• Complete the QUIP -RS (for a sample, see Section 19.12). 
• Complete Ease of Use Questionnaire (for a sample, see Section 19.15). 
• Register the visit in the IWRS.  
 
12.9. Unscheduled Dose Adjustment Visi ts 
If at any time during the LTS Phase of this study it is determined that a dose adjustment is required, where possible the medical monitor should be contacted to discuss the dose adjustment. 
Once agreed, “Unscheduled Dose Adjustment” should be registered in IWRS, indicating whether 
the dose adjustment should happen at the next LTS visit or at an unscheduled visit, to obtain the new dose of APL-130277 for the subject. Once IP is at site, subject will return for an 
unscheduled Dose Adjustment Visit (or this could be combined with the next scheduled LTS 
visit). 
At the investigator’s discretion, the subject may receive the adjusted dose in-clinic and undergo 
efficacy (MDS -UPDRS part III and ON/OFF assessments up to 90 minutes), and additional 
safety assessments as deemed appropriate.  
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 87  25 February 2019 Subjects will be contacted by telephone within 3 days after dose adjustment visits for assessment 
of effect of the dose adjustment and safety.  
The following will be performed: 
• Review restriction criteria.  
• Record vital signs (BP, HR, RR and body temperature). Vital signs should be measured after the subject has been resting in the supine position for at least 3 minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate will be taken again after standing for 2 to 
4 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of BP and HR. If the 
subject is unable to stand due to orthostatic symptoms such as light-headedness, dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon standing, every attempt should be made to obtain BP and HR in the sitting position. 
• Collect remaining study medication provided at the last visit (if required).  
• Provide subject home dosing diary (see Section  19.5) and instruct subjects to 
complete it 2  days before their subsequent in- clinic visit (if applicable).  
• Collect subject diaries completed since the last visit (if applicable; see Section  19.5). 
Verify that the diary has been appropriately completed and retrain subject on diary completion as necessary.  
• Assess treatment compliance.  
• Record any AEs/SAEs that have occurred since the last subject visit.  
• Record any new concomitant medications and/or changes to current concomitant medications being used by the subject since the last visit.  
• Record reason for the dose adjustment. 
• Dispense new study medication f or outpatient dosing (Only after all safety 
assessments have been completed and deemed safe by the investigator to dispense the new dose to the subject). 
This visit may occur over multiple days to accommodate receipt of the new dose of study drug (if necessary). 
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, dose adjustments are necessary for subject safety, 
tolerability or lack of efficacy, the Investigator may adjust the scheduled dose of study drug to 
the next dose (eg, to the 10 mg dose if the subject is recei ving 15 mg, or up to 20 mg dose if 
subject is receiving 15  mg). The Investigator should make all attempts to maintain subjects on a 
stable dose.  
Any subject whose dose has been reduced or increased at a Dose Adjustment Visit will self-administer study drug  using the new dosage at home and at all in- clinic visits for the 
remainder of the LTS Phase of the study. If, in the opinion of the Investigator, the dose is no longer optimal for the subject, after discussions/approval from the medical monitor, additiona l 
dose adjustments could be performed. 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 88  25 February 2019 12.10. Duration  of Treatment 
Subjects may participate in the study until the Sponsor terminates the study, or until commercial 
availability of APL -130277 in the subject’s  country. 
12.11. Assessments  
12.11.1. Order of Assessments  
The following summarizes the suggested sequence of assessments prior to dosing during SV2  
(de novo patients only ), Dose Titration Phase and the in -clinic visits during the LTS Phase: 
ECG – Vitals – Subject "OFF"/"ON" status - MDS-UPDRS Part III 
The following summariz es the suggested sequence of assessments after dosing during SV2 
(de novo subjects only ), Dose Titration Phase and the in -clinic visits during the LTS Phase: 
MDS-UPDRS Part III - Subject "OFF"/"ON" status - ECG – Vitals 
In the event the completion of the M DS-UPDRS Part III at a previous timepoint conflicts with 
other assessments that are scheduled, priority should be given to completing the MDS- UPDRS 
Part III first before conducting the remaining assessments.  
12.11.2. Clinical Safety Assessments  
12.11.2.1. Physical Examinations  
Complete physical examinations at all scheduled timepoints must include the following: 
head-eyes-ears-nose and throat; respiratory system; cardiovascular system; gastrointestinal 
system, including the oral cavity; musculoskeletal system; central and per ipheral nervous system; 
and skin. 
Abbreviated physical examinations at all scheduled timepoints must include head -eyes-ears-nose 
and throat; cardiovascular system; respiratory system; abdomen; and skin; to be done at t = 0 
(just prior to dosing) and 120 minutes post dosing at visits at TV1 to TV6 ( De novo subjects 
only). A window of +/- 10  minutes is given for post- dose abbreviated physical examinations 
during TV1 to TV6. 
All examinations performed in this study will include an oropharyngeal cavity examination by 
the Investigator (or designate trained to perform this examination) and will include a visual inspection of the inside of each cheek, the inside of the upper and lower lip, the surface of the 
tongue, and under the tongue. Each location within the oropharyngeal examination will be scored 
and graded as follows: 
Finding 
• None 
• Focal reddening  
• Multiple foci of reddening 
• Edema 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 89  25 February 2019 • Ulceration  
Grade 
• Mild 
• Moderate  
• Severe 
All abnormal findings at baseline will be recorded on the Medical History/Concomitant 
Diagnoses page (or equivalent) of the CRF. New abnormal findings or a worsening of baseline conditions detected at follow-up physical examinations will be recorded as AEs on the CRF. 
The Investigator (or designate) should evaluate each finding against AE criteria and complete the 
AE CRF, as appropriate. Photographs for reference may be taken by the Investigator (or designate) . 
Any subject who presents with an adverse event involving the oral cavity must be seen by a qualified dermatologist (or specialist in a related field ) within 24 hours. The dermatologist ( or 
specialist in a related field ) must examine the subject, and provide a consultation report including 
photographs of the oral cavity (see Section  13.1.7). 
12.11.2.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (HR, RR, BP and body temperature) will be measured at various timepoints during 
the study. Vital signs should be measured after the subject has been resting in the supine position 
for at least 3  minutes. Blood pressure and heart rate will be taken again after standing for 2 to 
4 minutes. The same arm should be used during each assessment of BP and HR. If the subject is 
unable to stand due to orthostatic symptoms such as light-headedness, dizziness, or changes in 
sensorium upon standing, every attempt should be made to obtain BP and HR in the sitting position. 
During the Dose Titration Phase  (De novo subjects only), if the 60 minute MDS -UPDRS Part  III 
assessment is not performed since the subject did not experience a full "ON" response within 
45 minutes of dosing, the vital signs assessment will be performed at the approximate time it 
would have been scheduled if the MDS- UPDRS Part  III assessment were performed  (ie 
70 minutes) . 
Study personnel will carefully monitor patients for signs of OH; defin ed as: 
• a systolic BP decrease of ≥  20 mmHg within three minutes of standing up from a 
supine position; and/or  
• a diastolic BP decrease of ≥ 10 mmHg within three minutes of standing up from a 
supine position.  
12.11.2.3. 12-Lead ECGs  
A standard 12- lead ECG will be perfo rmed at all timepoints outlined in the protocol. A triplicate 
12-lead ECG will be performed at the second Screening Visit (SV2) for De Novo subjects, at 
Screening Visit (SV1) for Rollover subjects , and at Screening Visit Period 2 (SVP2) for 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 90  25 February 2019 CTH-301 Complet er subjects . If required by the Investigator to assess De Novo Patient 
eligibility, a triplicate ECG may be performed at SV1, but will not be repeated at SV2.  
ECGs will be performed in a semi-recumbent position and after 5 minutes of rest.  
The following pa rameters will be collected : 
• Heart rate  
• PR interval  
• QRS interval  
• RR interval  
• QT interval  
• QTc Interval ( Fridericia’s correction)  
• QTc Interval ( Bazett’s correction)  
All ECGs should be assessed by the Investigator and deemed " Normal", "Abnormal, not 
clinically significant " and "Abnormal, clinically significant ". Abnormal readings that, in the 
opinion of the Investigator are deemed clinically significant should be reported as AEs on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
ECG assessments will be centralized and performed by a suitable vendor contract ed by the 
Sponsor and/or designate. 
12.11.2.4. Modified Hoehn and Yahr  
The Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale will be administered at the second Screening Visit (SV2) to 
verify that De Novo subjects meet the eligibility criteria for this study. Th is will be conducted in 
the "ON" state. 
No Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale will be performed on Rollover subjects during Screening 
Visit (SV1)  or on CTH-301 Completer subjects at Screening Visit Period 2 (SVP2) . 
12.11.2.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The following  clinical laboratory  test samples will be collected where documented:  
Hematology:  hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, RBC indices, mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), MCH concentration (MCHC), platelet 
count (or estimate), white blood cell (WBC) count including differential . 
Serum Chemistry:  albumin, total bilirubin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, chloride, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea, creatinine, glucose, sodium, potassium, uric acid, globulin, vitamin 
B6. 
Serum pregnancy will be performed on all females of child -bearing 
potential only.  
Urinalysis:  pH, specific gravity, blood, glucose, protein, ketones  
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 91  25 February 2019 Serology (at the Screening 
Visit only):  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B su rface antigen, 
Hepatitis C antibodies. 
12.11.2.6. Specimen  Handling  Requirements  
The transmission of infectious agents may occur through contact with contaminated needles and 
blood or blood products. Consequently, appropriate blood and body fluid precautions should be 
employed by all personnel involved in the drawing of blood and the handling of specimens in both the clinic and laboratory settings. 
In addition to appropriate handling of subject samples, specific regulations exist regarding the 
shipment of biologic/etiologic samples. Procedures and regulations for the packaging and shipping of infectious samples may be outlined in the study Laboratory Manual. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to ensure all study samples that are to be transported to another 
location are appropriately packed and shipped according to the applicable regulations. 
Blood and urine samples for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and serology will be sent 
to a central laboratory for analyses. Please see the Laboratory Manual for  details. 
12.11.2.7. C-SSRS 
At the Screening Visit (SV2 for De Novo subjects, SV1 for Rollover subjects, or SVP2 for 
CTH-301 Completer Patients), the C-SSRS ‘Screening’ assessment tool will be used. Subjects 
who answer ‘Yes’ to Questions 4 and 5 at this Visit should be excluded from participation in the study. All subsequent evaluations will utilize the C -SSRS ‘Since Last Visit’ assessment.  
Formal assessments of subject suicidal ideation and behavior will be assessed all in -clinic visits 
during the Dose Titration Phas e and LTS Phase of the study. A final assessment will be 
performed at the time of early termination.  
The Investigator or designate should closely monitor the responses of subjects during the 
interview and watch for signs that suggest current suicidal ideation or intent. 
12.11.2.8. Other Safety and Quality of Life Assessments  
The following assessments will be performed in this study at the timepoints indicated in the 
Schedule of Events: 
• PDQ-39 
• PGI 
• CGI 
• ESS 
• ZBI – Optional; to be completed if caregiver is present and consent is provided. 
• QUIP-RS 
• EQ-5D 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 92  25 February 2019 These assessments will be performed at any point during the scheduled visit in accordance with 
the guidelines for each (see applicable Appendices).  
12.11.2.9. Medical History  
At the Screening Visits, the Investigator (or designate) will review the subject’s medical history 
in order to ascertain the subject’s eligibility. The medical history should assess the patient’s 
current PD medications, including medication name, dose, number of tablets per dose (if applicable), dosage units and frequency per day. 
The medical history assessment will include a detailed assessment of the subject’s PD history, 
including, but not limited to: 
• Year of Diagnosis;  
• Presence of a rest tremor at the time of diagnosis;  
• Year when motor fluctuations began; 
• Type of "OFF" episodes experienced ( eg, morning akinesia, wearing "OFF, delayed 
"ON", dose failure, sudden " OFF"); 
• Number of " OFF" episodes per day; 
• Typical length of "OFF" episodes. 
• PD medications previously or currently taken, including: 
− dopamine agonists; 
− MAO-B inhibitors; 
− COMT inhibitors; 
− Amantadine;  
− Anti-cholinergics.  
12.11.3. Efficacy Assessments  
12.11.3.1. Confirmation of " OFF" or "ON" Episodes "OFF" and "ON" Training of 
Subjects at SV2 
"OFF" and "ON" Training 
Training will only be performed with De Novo  subjects only. Rollover subjects and CTH-301 
Completer subjects will not be required to undergo " OFF"/"ON" training during the Screening 
Visit. 
At Screening Visit 2 (SV2), De Novo subjects will present to the clinic having taken their usual 
morning dose of L-Dopa and any other adjunctive PD medication ; but before taking their next 
dose of medication. Their normal dose of L- Dopa (without adjunctive PD medication) will be 
administered in the clinic  approximately two hours after their normally scheduled second dose of 
PD medication . Prior to administration of their L -Dopa dose, subjects will be examined by the 
Investigator in order to verify tha t they are in the "OFF" state. If they are in the "OFF" state, the 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 93  25 February 2019 Investigator will educate the subject that this is an "OFF" period or " OFF" episode. The 
Investigator should clearly explain to the subject that this "OFF" time is when their medication 
has worn off, and does not provide benefits in terms of mobility, slowness and stiffness. 
Subjects will then take their normal dose of L-Dopa. Once the Investigator determines that the 
subject is experiencing an "ON" state, they should educate the subject that this is an "ON" state. 
The Investigator should clearly explain to the subject that an "ON" episode is the period of time 
where their medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness and stiffness, and 
they feel they can perform normal daily activities.  Once the patient has demonstrated 
understanding of the " OFF" and "ON" state, the training is complete. Successful completion  and 
understanding of this training should be noted in the appropriate eCRF. 
Any subject who cannot differentiate between an " ON" and "OFF" state will be deemed a screen 
failure. 
A window of ± 5 minutes is allowed for both the subject and the Investigator assessments at each 
post-dose timepoint. 
Definitions of Full "ON" and "OFF" 
The following definitions will be used in this study: 
"OFF" – defined as:  
• A period of time when medication has worn off and is no longer providing benefit 
with regard to mobility, slowness, and stiffness; 
• Confirmed by the Investigator using their clinical judgement as "OFF"**; 
• Confirmed by the subject as "OFF". 
** Not applicable for at-home assessments using the subject dosing diary. 
Full "ON" as assessed by the subject – defined as : 
• A period of time where medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, 
stiffness and slowness and where a subject feels he/she can perform normal daily activities.  
• A response comparable to or better than their normal response to PD medications 
prior to enrolling in the study. 
Full "ON" as assessed by the Investigator – defined as: 
• Based on clinical judgment, it is the period of time where the Investigator feels the 
medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, stiffness and slowness and 
the subject has adequate motor function to allow them to perform their normal daily 
activities.  
Clinical confirmation of the "OFF" state must occur prior to dosing a subject with study 
medication (or their standard L- Dopa dose at the second Screening V isit [SV2; De Novo subjects 
only]). The same assessor should be utilized for each subject throughout the study. 
Subjects must confirm they are in an " OFF" state prior to dosing with study medication  (or their 
standard L -Dopa dose at the second Screening Vi sit [SV2; De Novo subjects only]). 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 94  25 February 2019 At each Dose Titration and LTS Phase Year 1 Visit (except LTS V2), the Investigator will assess 
"OFF"/"ON" state as part of the MDS -UPDRS Part III assessments  except at 45  minutes, which 
will be assessed independent of the MDS -UPDRS Part III . 
At each Dose Titration and LTS Phase Year 1 Visit (except LTS V2), the subject should report: 
"OFF"/"ON" state at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes after dosing (site staff should prompt the 
patient). Subjects should also report: tim e to when the study medication is starting to have an 
effect (if applicable), and time to "OFF" following dosing (if it occurs within 60 minutes of 
dosing). The timing of this should begin when the study medication sublingual film has fully 
dissolved, and can be recorded using a stopwatch or other suitable timing device. These times should be documented on the appropriate form of the CRF. 
During the Dose Titration Phase only ( De novo subjects only), subject and Investigator 
assessments of "OFF" and "ON" state may cease if the patient does not experience a full "ON" 
state within 45  minutes of dosing. 
12.11.3.2. MDS-UPDRS Parts I, II and IV  
Investigators will administer Part I (Non -Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living), Part  II 
(Motor Aspects of Experiences of D aily Living) and Part IV (Motor Complications) at the  
Screening Visit (SV2  for De Novo subjects and  SV1 for Rollover subjects ; CTH-301 Completer 
subjects will not be required to undergo this assessment at Screening) and at LTS V3, LTS V4, 
LTS 5, and LTS 6). 
12.11.3.3. MDS-UPDRS Part III  
The Motor Function section (Part III) of the MDS- UPDRS will be administered at all visits 
where it is indicated.  
At SV2 (De Novo subjects only), administration will be performed at t = 0 (just prior to dosing) 
and at 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after L -Dopa administration. If the subject does not experience 
an "ON" within 90 minutes, the site should record the time when the subject turns "ON" and 
perform an additional MDS- UPDRS Part III assessment at this time.  
At all other visits, admin istration will be performed at t = 0 (just prior to dosing) and at 15, 30, 
60, and 90 minutes after dose administration. The same assessor should be utilized for each 
subject throughout the study.  
A window of ± 5 minutes is allowed for post- dose assessmen ts at each timepoint.  
These assessments will exclude the "Dyskinesia Impact on Part III Ratings " and the Hoehn and 
Yahr staging. The modified Hoehn and Yahr will be used during the Screening Visit ( SV2 – De 
Novo Patients only). 
During the Dose Titration Ph ase only, Investigator assessments may cease if the subject does not 
experience a full "ON" state within 45 minutes of dosing. 
The MDS -UPDRS can only be performed by the Principal Investigator or Sub-Investigator who 
has been trained to perform this evaluation. In specific cases, another appropriately experienced and certified site staff member can perform the assessment if approved by the Sponsor. 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 95  25 February 2019 12.11.3.4. Subject Dosing Di ary 
De novo Subjects (only) will be given a home dosing diary on TV1 of the Dose Titration Phase.  
All subjects will be given a dosing diary at all LTS  Visits. The diary will collect the following 
information: 
• Date; 
• Subject Number; 
• Time study treatment is self -administered;  
• Subject "ON"/"OFF" status at 30  minutes following dosing; 
• Type of "OFF" exp erienced (ie, morning akinesia; delayed "ON"; wearing "OFF"; no 
"ON"; or sudden "OFF"). 
The diary provided on TV1 (De novo Subjects only) will be used for training purposes only and 
the information collected will not be included in the CRF. Subjects will b e asked to complete the 
diary using their normal dose of L-Dopa and other adjunctive PD medication as the self-administration timepoint, and return this diary on LTS V1. Subjects will also be instructed on the different types of "OFF" episodes experienced and how to differentiate between each.  
Staff should review the completed diary returned at LTS V1 and re train subjects on diary completion, as necessary. Site staff should remind subjects at this visit that moving forward, the diary must be completed onl y when the subject self -administers their intended study treatment, 
not their other standard PD medication. 
During the LTS Phase of the study, subjects will complete the dosing diary on the 2 days prior to 
their scheduled in- clinic visits. Site staff will call all subjects approximately 3  days before the 
scheduled in- clinic visit in order to confirm the next visit and remind them to complete the 
dosing diary as part of their procedures in the study. Subjects should bring their completed dosing diary with them at their scheduled visit.  
12.11.3.5. Optional Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluation 
Blood draws for APL-130277 PK analyses will occur during LTS Phase Year  1, where indicated , 
at t = 0 (just prior to dosing) and at t = 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes.  A window 
of ± 5 minutes is allowed for post- dose assessments at each timepoint . PK assessments will be 
performed at select participating sites, and subjects must consent in order to participate in 
optional PK sub- study. Approximately 6 sites will be chosen, and 4 subjects from each of these 
are estimated to take part  in the sub-study. Dosing date and time as well as PK sampling date and 
time must be recorded in the CRF. Actual elapse time from dosing will be used in all PK parameter estimations.  
Instructions spe cific to PK draws will be outlined in the PK lab manual.  
12.12. Assessment of Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be assessed by counting the number of used and unused study 
medication pouches returned by subjects at each in -clinic visit during the LTS  Phase of this 
study relative to the amount given at the preceding visit. Discrepancies in the amount previously 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 96  25 February 2019 dispensed and returned by the subject will be queried by the Investigator and documented in the 
appropriate CRF. Significant non- compliance, as  assessed by the Investigator, may lead to 
subject dismissal from the study.  
The responsible monitors will verify the data being reported in the CRF versus the study 
medication returned by each subject . 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 97  25 February 2019 13. ADVERSE  EVENTS 
Adverse event recording and serious adverse event reporting will begin when the subject signs 
the ICF. AEs will be recorded in the CRFs until 7 to 10 days after the last dose of study drug, 
and SAEs will be reported through 14 days after the last dose of study drug. 
13.1.1. Definition  of Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject (or subject) or clinical investigation 
subject (or subject) administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the product, whether or not related to the product. 
Pre-existing diseases or conditions  will not be considered  AEs unless there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition. 
13.1.2. Definition  of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any untoward  medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death; 
• Is life threatening; 
• Requires in-subject hospitalization  (being admitted)  or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization;  
• Results in permanent  (persistent)  disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital  anomaly; 
• Is an important medical event. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to 
consider other situations serious, such as important medical events  that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject 
(or subject) or may require intervention to prevent another of the outcomes listed in the 
definition above. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An elective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the investigational 
drug, or a hospital admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not  qualify the condition 
or event as an SAE.  
A spontaneous abortion or  congenital  anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to 
the investigational  drug during pregnancy is an SAE. 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 98  25 February 2019 Due to the nature of subjects being enrolled in this study, and the given study objectives, 
subjects who are admitted for their titration and/or LTS Phase "OFF" episodes will not be 
considered a SAE.  
13.1.3. Definition  of Severity 
The clinical "severity"  of an AE will be classified as: 
Mild: Causes no limitation of usual activities  
Moderate:  Causes some li mitation of usual activities  
Severe: Prevents or severely limits usual activities  
 
13.1.4. Definition  of Start Date, Stop Date, and Duration  
Start Date: The date at which the AE is first noted 
Stop Date: The date at which the AE is known to be resolved. If it is not known  to have 
stopped, then indicate "ongoing."  
Duration: A time in days, hours or minutes. (This is optional.)  
 
13.1.5. Action(s) Taken  
Actions taken may consist of: 
None: No actions taken. 
Discontinued Investigational  
Drug: Investigational  drug was permanently discontinued  because of 
the AE. 
Change Investigational  Drug: Investigational  drug was given at a lower dose, at a longer 
interval between doses, or was temporarily  withheld because of 
the AE. 
Treatment:  Specified medication  (to be listed on the concomitant  medication  
chart) was used as a countermeasure. 
Others: Other actions, such as an operative procedure, were required 
because of the AE. 
13.1.6. Definition  of Expectedness  
An expected AE is an AE for which the nature or severity is consistent with the known AE 
profile of the product. For an investigational drug, the known information is contained in the IB. 
For a marketed product, the known information is contained in the current package insert for the 
product. 
An unexpected AE is an AE for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the 
current IB. For example, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 99  25 February 2019 listed elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular 
accidents.  
Furthermore, reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, 
already documented adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. Examples w ould be (a) acute 
renal failure as an expected adverse reaction with a subsequent new occurrence of interstitial 
nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first occurrence of fulminate hepatitis.  
13.1.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special intere st (AESI) for APL -130277 pertaining to the oral cavity requires 
reporting to the Sponsor or designate. These AESIs include, but are not limited to: 
• Stomatitis;  
• Oral irritation/oral inflammation/oral pain, including redness  
• Oral swelling; edema  
• Oral ulcers,  including blisters 
• Oral infections, including candidiasis 
• Oral paresthesia, hypoesthesia,  
• Oral sensation alterations such as dysgeusia, ageusia 
• Salivary complaints  
All AESIs should be reported to the Sponsor or designate, as appropriate, for processing. Instructions for reporting AESIs and their processing will be outlined in a separate study document. 
Any subject who presents with an adverse event involving the oral cavity must be seen by a 
qualified dermatologist (or specialist in a related field ) within 24 hours (if it is not possible to 
report within 24 hours, the Medical Monitor should be consulted immediately to discuss the evaluation plan including timeline) . The dermatologist (or specialist in a related field ) must 
examine the subject, and provide a consultation report including photographs of the oral cavity.  
Subjects should be instructed to notify the clinical site within 24 hours if they develop any one or 
more of the oral events noted above. 
For all AESIs, if the event meets seriousness criter ia, the Investigator will report the event to the 
Sponsor or designate within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the event, as outlined in 
Section 13.1.14. All AESIs which do not meet the seriousness criteria will be reported by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor or designate within 7 days of site awareness (Section 13.1.14). 
 
13.1.8. Definition  of Relationship  to Investigational Drug(s) 
The categories for classifying the Investigator’s opinion regarding the relationship of an AE to 
investigational drug(s) are listed below: 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 100  25 February 2019 Certain: An AE occurring in a plausible time relationship to investigational 
drug administration and which cannot be explained by a concurrent 
disease or other drugs or events. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) is clinically reasonable.  
Probable (likely):  An AE with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the 
investigational drug and which is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or events. The response to 
withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) is clinically reasonable. 
Possible: An AE with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the 
investigational drug, but which could also be explained by 
concurrent disease or other drugs or events. Information on drug 
withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely:  An AE, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to investigational drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, events, or 
underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not related:  An AE with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal 
relationship to investigational drug administration (eg, no temporal 
relationship to drug administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; investigation shows that the drug 
was not administered; another cause was proven; etc.).  
13.1.9. Definition  of Outcome  at the Time of Last Observation 
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as: 
• Resolved; 
• Resolved with sequelae; 
• Ongoing;  
• Death; 
• Unknown. 
Death should only be selected as an outcome when the AE resulted in death. If more than 1 AE is 
possibly related to the subject’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE 
attributed as the c ause of death in the death certificate or summary.  
13.1.10. Documentation of Adverse Events 
The Investigator will monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non-leading questions at each visit or evaluation. The occurrence of all AEs will be documented in the C RF with the 
following information, where appropriate: 
• AE name or term; 
• When the AE first occurred (start date); 
• When the AE stopped (stop date), or an indication  of "ongoing"; 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 101  25 February 2019 • How long the AE persisted (optional); 
• Severity of the AE; 
• Seriousness; 
• Actions taken; 
• Outcome;  
• Investigator opinion regarding  the relationship  of AE to the investigational  drug(s). 
13.1.11. Follow-up of Subjects With an Adverse Event 
Any AE will be followed to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be 
explained by another known cause(s) (ie, concurrent condition or medication) and clinical 
judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted. All findings relevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject’s medical record. 
13.1.12. Special Procedures  for Managing AEs/SAEs 
If AEs occur in a subject which are not tolerable, or for which continued administration of 
investigational drug is not reasonable in view of the potential benefit to subject, the Investigator must decide whether to stop investigat ional treatment and/or treat the subject. Subject 
withdrawal should be avoided, if possible. If discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever the duration of discontinuation. 
Unblinding procedures are not applicable for this study as it is being conducted as an open- label 
study. 
13.1.13. Notification of Serious Adverse Events 
If the Investigator or s tudy center staff becomes aware of a SAE that occurs in a study subject 
from signing informe d consent through 14 days following the last dose of the study medication, 
this must be reported immediately to  the Sponsor whether considered related or unrelated to the  
study drug. SAEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the event 
is otherwise explained.  
An initial / follow -up SAE form as applicable must be completed and signed and sent via fax or 
email (see Table 1) to PPD-PVG within 1 business day of the Investigator or study center staff 
becoming aware of the event. The SAE form must be signed by the Investigator or appropriate designee. The Sponsor will provide the SAE form used to report SAEs. 
The Sponsor or designee will promptly notify all study centers and In vestigators of a SAE that is 
determined to be expedited to the Regulatory Authorities in accordance with  applicable law (s) 
and regulation(s ). These SAEs must be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB), Research Ethics Board (REB),  or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) by the 
Investigator or the appropriate person at the study center if required per  IRB/REB/IEC 
guidelines. 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 102  25 February 2019 13.1.14. Notification of Oral Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Oral AESIs ( Section 13.1.7) that do not meet seriousness criteria ( Section 13.1.2) must be 
reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor within 7 business days of the Investigator or study 
center staff awareness of the event.  
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 103  25 February 2019 14. TREATMENTS 
14.1. Treatments Administered (APL -130277 and Matching Placebo) 
APL-130277 is a rectangular bilayer film containing apomorphine hydrochloride. APL-130277 
is intended for fast sublingual absorption for use in rescue therapy for acute intermittent "OFF" 
episodes experienced by PD subjects. APL -130277 bilayer is composed of 2 layers laminated 
together: a first layer is composed of cellulose ether based film, containing drug substance, 
stabilizers and plasticizers; a second layer contains a pH modifier (pyridoxine hydrochloride) 
contained within a similar cellulosic film base, flavor agents and a permeation enhancer. 
Each package of investigational drug product will be labeled with study specific information 
meeting all the applicable regulatory requirements, including specifying the dose of apomorphine. 
Individual sublingual films of APL-130277 will be supplied packed into unit dose pouches. 
Buffer layer will be on the side of the sublingual film that has an alphanumeric or numeric printing. 
APL-130277 sublingual films will be provided in 5 strengths: 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg and 
30 mg. Two sublingual films will be administered sequentially to form the 35  mg dose (a 20 mg 
dose first followed immediately by the 15  mg dose). In this study, placebo sublingual films wil l 
also be prepared for training purposes only, which will be identical in appearance, size and color, 
but contain no active ingredient (ie, apomorphine).  
14.2. Administration of Study Medication  (APL-130277 and Placebo 
APL--130277)  
During Dose Titration (De novo Subjects only) and applicable visits in the LTS Phase, dosing 
will occur in the clinic administered by clinic staff. Time of dosing will be the time when the 
sublingual film is placed underneath the tongue. Subjects will be instructed to consume a glass of water immediately prior to dosing, and staff will ensure the sublingual space is free of excess water. 
Using gloved hands, or a single- use plastic disposable tweezers, staff will place the product 
beneath the tongue, with the drug side facing up towards  the tongue (ie, the side of the film 
that does not have an alphanumeric printing), and ask subjects to close their mouth 
naturally. Subjects should not swallow the medication and should also try not to swallow their saliva for at least 3 minutes. If, upon inspection at the three minute mark, the film is 
not completely dissolved, subjects should be instructed to close their mouth and hold the 
study medication under their tongue for another minute (ie,  maximum of 4 minutes in 
total). 
If the subject feels the film has fully dissolved prior to the three minute mark, they should indicate this to site staff by raising their hand, who will then verify. If upon inspection, the film is not completely dissolved, subjects should be instructed to close their mouth again 
and hold the study medication under their tongue. Staff may verify at regular intervals, as 
appropriate, for a duration maximum of 4 minutes in total.  
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 104  25 February 2019 At LTS V1, De novo subjects (only) will undergo outpatient self- administration training with 
clinic staff using placebo sublingual films. This training is performed in order to familiarize 
subjects with the self -administration process during the LTS Phase. Staff should demonstrate to 
subjects the process of opening the individual dose pouches and handling the individual 
sublingual films. Subjects should not self-administer the placebo sublingual films.  Subjects will 
not be dismissed until they have adequately been trained and site staff feel confident they understand the full process. 
Prior to each self -administration, subjects will be instructed to consume a glass of water 
immediately prior to dosing, and ensure the sublingual space is free of excess water. Using their 
hands, subjects (or their caregivers) should place the product beneath the tongue, with the drug 
side facing up towards the tongue (ie, the side of the film that does not have an alphanumeric 
printing), and close their mouth naturally. Subjects should not swallow the medication and should also try not to swallow their saliva for at least 3 minu tes, or until they feel the film 
has fully dissolved.  
The 35 mg dose will be administered by dosing with the 20 mg sublingual film, and after 3 minutes have elapsed, followed by dosing with a 15 mg sublingual film.  
During the in -clinic visits of the Dose Titration Phase ( De novo subjects only), subjects will be 
dosed by clinic staff. The time of dosing (t = 0) will be the time when the sublingual film is placed underneath the tongue. 
At each outpatient visit, subjects will be provided sufficient study medication in order to 
self-administer for up to 5 "OFF" episodes per day until their next scheduled visit. Subjects will 
be instructed to wait a minimum of 2  hours between doses taken at home. Unused study 
medication will be collected by each site and inventor ied. 
14.3. Storage 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the proper storage of study medication according to procedures agreed in advance. Unit dose pouches should be stored at a controlled room 
temperature: 68 -77°F (20-25°C). The study drug should be stored in a limited -access location 
with appropriate environmental controls (e.g., for temperature) and a mechanism for documenting that required conditions were maintained during the entire storage timeframe. 
Temperature excursions between 15°C (59°F) and 30°C (86°F) do not need to be reported to the 
sponsor, unless the duration exceeds 7 consecutive days. 
If the storage conditions fall below 15°C (59°F), reach above 30°C (86°F), or if there is an event 
where temperatures reach above 25 °C (77°F) up to 30°C (86°F) for at least 7  consecutive days, 
the excursions should be reported to the sponsor. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for 
additional details and reporting instructions. 
Subjects will be instructed to store the study medication at room temperature.  
The Investigator must maintain accurate and adequate records including expiry dates, lot 
number, quantities received, individual usage, etc. At the end of the study, the Investigator must 
also return unused supplies to the Sponsor giving an account of usag e in a trial. At the time of 
return to the Sponsor, the Investigator must verify that all unused or partially used drug supplies 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 105  25 February 2019 have been returned by the subject and that no remaining supplies are in the Investigator's 
possession. Certificates of delivery  and returns must be signed and filed in the Study Site File. 
Refer to Study Pharmacy Manual for additional information. 
14.4. Packaging and Labeling  
During the Dose Titration Phase, open- label titration kits containining 12 dose level pouches will 
be supplied to sites. The kits and the individual pouches will be labeled with all applicable information.   
Kits of sublingual films of Placebo APL -130277, containing 3 individual dose peelable foil 
laminate pouches will be supplied for training purposes. The kits and Individual pouches will be 
labelled with all applicable information.  
During the LTS Phase, treatment kits of APL -130277, containing 150 individual dose peelable 
foil laminate pouches, will be labeled with study specific information meeting all the applica ble 
regulatory requirements, including specifying the dose of apomorphine. Investigational drug 
product will be administered both in clinic and at home during the LTS Phase. 
Refer to the pharmacy manual (or equivalent) for more details. 
14.5. Drug Accountability 
Drug supplies, which will be provided by Sunovion or a CRO appointed by Sunovion, must be 
kept in a secure, limited access storage area.  
The Investigator, pharmacist, and/or investigational drug storage manager must maintain records 
of the product’s delivery to the trial site, the inventory at the site, the use by each subject, and the 
return to Sunovion of unused product(s). These records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiry dates, and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product(s) 
and trial subjects. The Investigator, pharmacist, and/or investigational drug storage manager will 
maintain records that document adequately that the subjects were provided the doses specified by the clinical trial protocol and reconci le all investigational product(s) received from Sunovion. At 
the time of return to Sunovion, the Investigator or site designate must verify that all unused or partially used drug supplies have been returned by the clinical trial subject and that no remaini ng 
supplies are in the Investigator’s possession. 
Note: If any of the investigational drug is not dispensed; is lost, stolen, spilled, unusable; or 
arrives at the clinical site in a damaged container, this information must be documented and reported to Sunovion and appropriate regulatory agencies as required. The investigational drug 
will only be administered to subjects participating in this study. Only authorized study site 
personnel may supply or administer the investigational drug. 
Refer to Study Pharma cy Manual for additional information. 
14.6. Method of Assigning  Subjects to Treatment  Groups 
Subjects will be assigned open -label APL -130277 t reatment using an IWRS system . 
The strength ( ie, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg or 35 mg) to be given will be determined 
during the Dose Titration Phase of the study for De novo subjects. 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 106  25 February 2019 The strength to be given for Rollover subjects will be the dose they were on in the previous 
study. 
The strength to be given for Completer subjects will be the dose they previously received in study CTH -301 (under protocol version 3.00). 
Doses may be adjusted in the LTS Phase of the study based on safety/tolerability and efficacy  
assessed during unscheduled Dose Adjustment Visits. 
14.7. Randomization  and Blinding 
At Screening, the IWRS will as sign a unique subject identification number to the subject known 
as the Screening Number. This number will be associated with the subject throughout the study. Every subject that signs an ICF must be entered into the IWRS regardless of eligibility in order to obtain a Screening Number. This 7 digit number will consist of a 4 digit site ID followed by a 3 digit number assigned sequentially by the IWRS within each site. 
There will be no blinding of treatment and no randomization performed. 
When the Dose Titration Phase for a subject is complete  (De novo subjects only), sites should 
enter all titration MDS -UPDRS Part III date for that patient into the appropriate CRF within 48 
hours of the last titration visit for review by the Medical Monitor.

15.1. Statistical Analysis Plan  
Full statistical considerations, table mock -ups and final analysis of safety and efficacy data 
collected in this study will be outlined in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan. This plan will be 
finalized prior to locking the database.  
15.2. Analysis Sets 
15.2.1. Titration Full Analysis Set  
All subjects who are enrolled in this study and receive one dose of study medication during the dose titration phase will be included in the titration full analysis set. This analysis set will be used for safety and efficacy analysis of titration phase data.  
15.2.2. LTS Full Analysis Set  
All subjects who are enrolled and receive at least one dose of study medication during the LTS phase will comprise the LTS full analysis set. This set will be used for safety and efficacy 
analysis of LTS phase data.  
15.3. Sample Size Calculation.  
The sample size of this safety study is not based on any power calculations.  
15.4. Efficacy Analysis  
The efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by time point for the LTS Full Analysis set and separately for De Novo Subjects and Rollover Subjects. 
The changes from baseline in the continuous efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively. The categorical endpoints will be analyzed using subject counts and percentages. 
15.5. Safety Analysis 
The analysis of the safety data will focus on data collected during the LTS Phase. In addition, all 
safety data will be reported separately for the Dose Titration Phase. The safety data will be 
primarily analyzed for the full analysis set, but additional summaries will be  done separately for 
De Novo Subjects and Rollover Subjects (based on initial enrollment status). Adverse events will 
be tabulated according to the MedDRA. Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized 
by body system and preferred term. The AE analy sis will focus on the dopaminergic TEAEs. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the overall incidence of TEAEs.  
15.6. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
For plasma PK samples, apomorphine levels and metabolites (norapomorphine and apomorphine sulphate) will be  measured in plasma using a validated liquid chromatography- tandem mass 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 108  25 February 2019 spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) method developed by Info Kinetics. Apomorphine- glucuronide and 
norapomorphine- glucuronide levels will be measured using a qualified LC -MS/MS method. 
Pharmacokin etic parameters will be derived using noncompartmental methods employing 
WinNonlin® Phoenix version 6.3 or higher (Pharsight, St Louis, MO). Pharmacokinetic analysis 
will be conducted using concentration-time data for apomorphine and metabolites. 
For pharm acokinetic analysis concentrations that are below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will 
be assigned a value of zero when they precede quantifiable samples in the initial portion of the 
profile. Following C max, BLQ values embedded between two quantifiable data points will be 
treated as missing when calculating area under the curve. BLQ values occurring at the end of the 
collection interval (after the last quantifiable concentration) will be treated as missing data. 
When consecutive BLQ concentrations are fo llowed by quantifiable concentrations in the 
terminal portion of the concentration curve, these quantified values will be excluded from the PK 
analysis by assigning them a value of missing, unless otherwise warranted by the concentration -time profile.  
The following PK parameters if appropriate for the particular analyte will be estimated by 
noncompartmental methods from plasma samples ( Table 10). Additional parameters may be 
calculated as necessary. Actual elapsed time from dosing will be used to determine all individual 
PK parameters. A detailed PK analysis plan will be developed prior to conducting analysis. 
Table 10: Pharmacokinetic Parameters to be Estimated

The individual subject concentration- time data will be listed and displayed graphically on linear 
and semi-log scales. The concentration -time data will be summarized descriptively in tabular and 
graphical formats (linear and semi -log scales ) overlaid by dose level. Individual PK parameters 
from the noncompartmental PK analysis will be tabulated, where calculable, and summarized 
descriptively. The following summary statistics will be presented for PK parameters: N, 
arithmetic mean, CV%, SD of  the arithmetic mean, median, minimum, maximum, geometric 
mean and CV% of the geometric mean. T max will be presented as N, median, minimum and 
maximum.

Steps to assure the accuracy and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified Investigators 
and appropriate study site, review of protocol procedures with the Investigator and associated 
personnel prior to the study, periodic monitor ing visits, and meticulous data management. 
16.1. Regulations and Guidelines 
By signing this study protocol, the Investigator agrees to conduct this study in accordance with all laws, regulations and guidelines of the pertinent regulatory authorities, including and in 
accordance with the April 1996 ICH Guidance for Industry E6 GCP and in agreement with the 
Declaration of Helsinki (including all applicable amendments). While delegation of certain aspects of the study to Sub-Investigators and study coordinators is appropriate, the Principal 
Investigator (PI) will remain personally accountable for closely overseeing the study and for 
ensuring compliance with the protocol and all applicable regulations and guidelines. The PI is responsible for maintaining a list of all persons that have been delegated study- related 
responsibilities ( eg, Sub-Investigators and study coordinators) and their specific study related 
duties. 
Investigators should ensure that all persons who have been delegated study- related 
responsibilities ar e adequately qualified and informed about the protocol, investigational drugs, 
and their specific duties within the context of the study. Investigators are responsible for 
providing Sunovion with documentation of the qualifications, GCP training, and resea rch 
experience for themselves and their staff as required by Sunovion and the relevant governing 
authorities.  
See Section  19.2 for additional information. 
16.2. Study Initiation  
Clinical site staff may not screen or enroll subjects into the study until receiving notification 
from Sunovion or its designee that the study can be initiated at the clinical site. The clinical site 
will not be authorized for study initiation until:  
• The clinical site has received the appropriate IRB/REB/IEC approval for the protocol 
and the IRB/REB/IEC- approved ICF;  
• The clinical site has a Clinical Trial Agreement in place;

16.3.2. Case Report Forms 
As part of the responsibilities assumed by participating in the study, the Investigator agrees to 
maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as part of the case histories for all subjects 
who sign an ICF. 
The vendor selected to  perform CRF design will be responsible for drafting CRFs for the study, 
which Sunovion will review and approve before implementation. An electronic CRF may be 
used instead of paper CRFs, and the term CRF is synonymous for both types of CRFs. 
CRFs are cons idered confidential documents and should be handled and stored accordingly. 
Sunovion or its designee will provide the necessary training on the use of the specific CRF 
system used during the study to ensure that the information is captured accurately and appropriately. 
In order to ensure data accuracy, CRF data for individual subject visits should be completed as 
soon as possible following the visit in accordance with the site Clinical Trial Agreement in place . 
CRFs will be reviewed by the Clinical Research  Associate (CRA) during monitoring visits. The 
CRA will verify data recorded with source documents. A copy of all the CRFs will be sent securely to Sunovion at the end of the study. 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 112  25 February 2019 If the study is managed using an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, the Investigator agrees 
to maintain accurate CRFs/EDC modules and source documentation as part of the case histories 
for all subjects who sign an ICF.  
CRFs/EDC modules are considered confidential documents and should be handled and stored 
accordingly. Sunovion or its designee will provide the necessary training on the use of the 
specific EDC system used during the study to ensure that the information is captured accurately 
and appropriately. 
All corrections or changes requested to the study data must be made as soon as possible by the 
study site, and verified by the Investigator. All corrections or changes made to any study data must be appropriately tracked in an audit trail. When all incorrect and/or inconsistent data has been accounted for, EDC data will be considered complete.  
16.3.3. Source Documents  
All information recorded in the CRF must be supported by corresponding source documentation. 
Examples of acceptable source documentation include but are not limited to hospital records, 
clinic and office charts, laboratory notes, and recorded data from automated instruments, 
memoranda, and pharmacy dispensing records. If available, source documents for at least the 2 years prior to screening will be reviewed by the CRA to verify the patient’s eligibility for the 
study. 
Original versions of the laboratory reports and ECG tracings will be retained at the clinical site with the patient’s source documents, and anonymized copies provided to Sunovion with the CRF copies. 
16.4. Data Quality Assurance  
Sunovion and its designees will perform quality control and assurance checks on all clinical 
studies that it sponsors. Sunovion, or its designee, will be responsible for additional data quality 
assurance related to the clinical data being generated, entered and maintained as part of this  
clinical study . 
16.4.1. Monitoring  the Study 
Clinical monitors will conduct site visits to the study facilities to monitor the study. The Investigator agrees to allow these monitors and other authorized Sunovion personnel access. The 
clinical site will be monitor ed by Sunovion and/or its designate to ensure compliance with the 
protocol, GCP, and applicable regulations and guidelines. As representatives of Sunovion, CRAs 
are responsible for following the study protocol closely and notifying project management of an y 
noted deviations. The assigned CRA(s) will visit the Investigator and clinical site at periodic 
intervals and maintain periodic communication. The CRA(s) will maintain current knowledge of 
the study through observation, review of study records and source documentation, and discussion 
of the conduct of the study with the Investigator and staff. While on site, the CRA(s) will review regulatory documents, compare entries in the source documents, and review investigational drug 
accountability records. The CRA will ask for clarification and/or correction of any noted 
inconsistencies.  
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 113  25 February 2019 By signing the protocol, the Investigator agrees to meet with the CRA during clinical site visits, 
to ensure that study staff is available to the CRA(s) as needed, to provide the C RA(s) access to 
all study documentation  and medical records , to the clinical supplies dispensing and storage area, 
and agrees to assist the monitors in their activities, if requested. The Investigator also agrees to allow inspectors from regulatory agencies to review records and to assist the inspectors in their 
duties, if requested. 
16.4.2. Routine Data Collection  
CRFs will be reviewed by the CRA during monitoring visits. The CRA will verify data with 
source documents. If the CRA’s comparison of the original CRF data with source documents 
reveals data discrepancies or omissions that require study staff to make corrections, corrections will be made. After the CRF data have been monitored and all corrections have been made, the 
Investigator must appropriately document within the data system his/her agreement with the data 
contained therein. If corrections are required subsequent to the Investigator’s signature, the Investigator must document his/her agreement with the CRF data to confirm the accuracy of the 
changed data. A copy of all CRF data will be retained at the clinical site. If corrections are 
required after all data have been electronically transferred, corrections that have been made must be verified in writing by the Investigator, and new data provided to Sunovion. 
16.4.3. Expedited  Data Collection  
Monitoring of selected CRF data may occur following the CRF submission, using data from the 
data system and source documents as necessary. Any post submission/transfer corrections of CRF data must be verified in writing by the Investigator, and new data provided to Sunovion. 
16.4.4. Data Management 
A vendor contracted by Sunovion will provide the data management system and data management services for the study. An EDC system may be implemented.  
Clinical site personnel will be responsible for  providing resolutions to all data queries.
 The 
Investigator will be required to review and document data to ensure the  accuracy of the corrected 
and/or clarified data. If an EDC system is implemented, this documentation will be electronic.  
Query forms or documentation must be generated and filed by the site. 
16.4.5. Study Termination  
The study may be terminated at Sunovion’s discretion at any time for any reason. If Sunovion 
discovers conditions that warrant early termination of the study, the Investigat or will be notified 
by Sunovion or its designee. Examples of conditions that may warrant premature termination of 
the study include, but are not limited to the following: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled 
in the study; and 
• The decision on the part of Sunovion to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or development of the investigational product. 
Protocol CTH -301, Version 5.00 APL-130277 
Confidential and Proprietary 114  25 February 2019 16.4.6. Clinical Site Closure 
On termination of the study, all screening and ongoing study related procedures conducted at the 
clinical site will be closed. Sunovion may terminate participation of the clinical site at any time. 
Examples of conditions that may warrant premature termination of a clinical site include, but are 
not limited to the following:  
• Noncompliance with the protocol and/or applicable regulations and guidelines; 
• Inadequate subject enrollment; 
• Administrative reasons . 
16.4.7. Data Safety Monitoring  Board 
A DSMB will be utilized in this study in order to monitor subject safety independently from the 
Sponsor. 
The DSMB will be composed of members who are not participating in the trial, led by a Chair. 
The DSMB will be responsible for monitoring subject safety, and with the support of an 
independent statistician, review safety data collected for a planned analysis or other analysis as 
required by the DSMB. The DSMB, under specific circumstances, may suggest revisions to the current protocol if these improve patient safety and potential outcomes. 
The independent statistician will have access to regular database transfers. For each safety 
meeting, the statistician will prepare summary tables, listings and figures, as appropriate, in order to aid the DSMB in making a decision on patient safety. Data used will be as presented in the 
study database, whether it has undergo ne quality control and cleaning. Safety data reviewed and 
analyzed will, at a minimum, include SAEs, AEs that are related to the oropharyngeal 
examinations, and any other safety data required by the DSMB to make an assessment.  
The composition, responsibility and general overview of procedures will be outlined in the DSMB Charter and finalized prior to implementation of any DSMB review.

                   MDS-UPDRS 
 
  
The Movement Disorder Society (MDS)-sponsored new version of the UPDRS is founded on the critique 
that was formulated by the Task Force for Rating Scales in Parkinson’s disease ( Mov Disord 2003;18:738-750).   
Thereafter, the MDS recruited a Chairperson to orga nize a program to provide the Movement Disorder 
community with a new version of the UPDRS that would maintain the overall format of the original UPDRS, but 
address issues identified in the critique as weakness es and ambiguities. The Chairperson identified 
subcommittees with chairs and members. Each part was written by the appropriate subcommittee members 
and then reviewed 
and ratified by the entire gr oup. These members are listed below.  
 
 
The MDS- UPDRS has four parts:  Part I (non-mo tor expe riences of daily living), Part II (motor 
experiences of daily 
living, Part III (motor examination) and Part IV (mot or complications).  Part I has two 
components: IA concerns a number of behaviors that ar e assessed by the investigator with all pertinent 
information from 
patients and caregivers, and IB is co mplete d by the patient with or without the aid of the 
caregiver, bu
t independently of the investigator.  These sections can, howeve r, be reviewed by the rater to 
ensure that all questions are answered clearly and the rater can help ex plain any perceived ambiguities. Part II
is designed to be a self-administered questionnaire like Part IB, but can be reviewed by the 
investigator to ensure completeness and clarity. Of note, the official versio ns of Part IA, Part IB and Pa rt II of
the MDS-UPDRS do not have separate on or off ratings.  However, for individual  programs or protocols the same
questions can be used separately for on and off. Part III has instructions for the rater to give or  demonstrate
to the patient; it is completed by the rater.  Part IV has instructions for th e rater and also instructions to be read
to the patient. This part integrates patient-derived information with the rater’s clinical observations and judgments 
and is completed by the rater.

Page 2  Part I:  Non-Motor Aspects of Ex periences of Daily Living (nM-EDL)   
Overview:  This portion of the scale assesses the non- motor impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on patients’ 
experiences of daily living. There are 13 questions.  Part 1A  is administered by the rater (six questions) and focuses 
on complex behaviors.  Part 1B is a component of the self-administered Patient Questionnaire that covers seven 
questions on non-motor experiences of daily living.  
  
Part 1A:  In administering Part IA, the examiner should use the following guidelines: 
 
1.   Mark at the top of the form t he primary data source as patient, caregi ver, or patient and caregiver in equal 
proportion.     
2.   The response to each item should refer to a period encompassing the prior week including the day on which the 
information is collected.  
3.    All items must have an integer rating (no half points, no missing scores).  In the event that an item does not 
apply or cannot be rated (e.g., amputee who cannot walk), the item is marked UR for Unable to Rate. 
4.  The answers should reflect the usual level of function and words such as “usually”, “generally”, “most of the time” 
can be used with patients. 
5.  Each question has a text for you to read (Instruction s to patients/caregiver).  After that statement, you can 
elaborate and probe based on the target symptoms outlined in the Instructions to examiner.  You should NOT 
READ the RATING OPTIONS to the patient/caregiver, because these are written in medical terminology.  From 
the interview and probing, you will use your medica l judgment to arrive at the best response.  
6.  Patients may have co-morbidities and other medical condi tions that can affect their function.  You and the patient 
must rate the problem as it exists and do not attempt to  separate elements due to Parkinson’s disease from other 
conditions.   
EXAMPLE OF NAVIGATING THROUGH TH E RESPONSE OPTIONS FOR PART 1A  
 Suggested strategies for obtaini ng the most accurate answer: 
After reading the instructions to the patient, you will need to  probe the entire domain under discussion to determine 
Normal vs. problematic:  If your questions do not identify any problem in this domain, record 0 and move on to the 
next question.   
If your questions identify a problem in this domain, you sh ould work next with a reference anchor at the mid-range 
(option 2 or Mild) to find out if the patient functions at this  level, better or worse.  You will not be reading the choices of  
responses to the patient  as the responses use clinical terminology.  You will be asking enough probing questions to 
determine the response that should be coded.  
Work up and down the options with the patient to identify  the most accurate response, giving a final check by 
excluding the options above and below the selected response. 
Is this item normal for you? 
Consider mild (2) as a reference point 
and then compare with slight (1). 
Consider moderate (3) to see if this 
answer fits better. 
Consider severe (4) to see if this 
answer fits better. 
‘Yes, severe is closest.’ ‘No, I have problems.’ 
If mild is closer than slight. Mark (0) Normal. 
Confirm and mark (1) Slight. 
Confirm and mark (2) Mild. 
Confirm and mark (3) Moderate. 
Confirm and mark (4) Severe. If moderate is closer than mild. ‘Yes’. 
‘Yes, slight is closest’. 
‘No, moderate is too severe’. 
‘No, severe is too severe’.

WEEK. If you are not bothered by a problem, you can simply respond NO.  I am trying to be thorough, so I may ask 
questions that have nothing to do with you.

1.1  COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT   
Instructions to examiner: Consider all types of altered level of cognitive function including cognitive slowing, 
impaired reasoning, memory loss, defic its in attention and orientation. Rate their impact on activities of 
daily living as perceived by t he patient and/or caregiver. 
 Instructions to patients [and caregiver]: Over the past week have you had problems remembering things, 
following conversations, paying attention, thinking clea rly, or finding your way around the house or in town? 
[If yes, examiner asks patient or caregi ver to elaborate and probes for information]    
  
0:  Normal:        No cognitive impairment. 
 1:  Slight: Impairment appreciated by patient or ca regiver with no concrete interference with the 
patient’s ability to carry out normal ac tivities and social interactions. 
 2:  Mild: Clinically evident cognitive dysfun ction, but only minimal interference with the 
patient’s ability to carry out normal ac tivities and social interactions. 
 3:  Moderate: Cognitive deficits interfere with but  do not preclude the patient’s ability to carry out 
normal activities and social interactions. 
 4:  Severe: Cognitive dysfunction precludes the pati ent’s ability to carry out normal   activities and 
social interactions.

1.2  HALLUCINATIO NS AND PSYCHOSIS 
 
Instructions to examiner:  Consider both illusions (misinterp retations of real stimuli) and 
hallucinations (spontaneous false sensations). Consider all major sensory domains (visual, 
auditory, tactile, olfactory and gustatory). Determine presence of unformed (for example sense of presence or fleeting false impressions) as well as formed (fully developed and detailed) 
sensations. Rate the patients insight into hallucinations and identify delusions and psychotic 
thinking.   Instructions to patients [and caregiver]:
 Over the past week have you seen, heard, smelled or felt 
things that were not really there? [If yes, examiner asks patient or caregiver to elaborate and 
probes for information]   
0:  Normal:        No hallucinations or psychotic behaviour. 
 
1:  Slight: Illusions or non-formed halluci nations, but patient recognizes them without 
loss of insight. 
 2:  Mild: Formed hallucinations independent of environmental stimuli. No loss of 
insight. 
 3:  Moderate:    Formed hallucinations with loss of insight.  
4:  Severe:        Pati ent has delusions or paranoia. 
 
 SCORE 
 
 

 
 
1.3  DEPRESSED MOOD  
Instructions to examiner
: Consider low mood, sadness, hopeles sness, feelings of emptiness or 
loss of enjoyment. Determine their presence and duration over the past week and rate their interference with the patient’s ability to carry out  daily routines and engage in social interactions.

Instructions:   
 
This questionnaire will ask you about y our experiences of daily living.  
 There are 20 questions.  We are trying to be thorough, and some of these questions may 
therefore not apply to you now or ever.  If you do not have the prob lem, simply mark 0 for NO.  
 Please read each one carefully and read all answers before selecting the one that best applies to you.   We are interested in your average or usual f unction over the past week including today.  
Some patients can do things better at one time of the day than at other s.  However, only one 
answer is allowed for each question, so please ma rk the answer that best  describes what you 
can do most of the time
. 
 You may have other medical condi tions besides Parkinson’s disease.  Do not worry about 
separating Parkinson’s disease from other conditions.  Just  answer the question with your 
best response.     Use only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for answers, not hing else.  Do not leave any blanks.  
 Your doctor or nurse can review  the questions with you, but th is questionnaire is for patients 
to complete, either alone or with their caregivers.

and may have mentioned problems that you may never dev elop at all.  Not all patients develop all 
these problems, but because they can occur, it is important to ask all the questions to every 
patient.  Thank you for your time and attent ion in completing this questionnaire.

  July 1, 2008  Part III:   Motor Examination    
 
Overview:  This portion of the scale assesses the motor signs of PD.  In administering Part III of the MDS-UPDRS  
the examiner
 should comply with the following guidelines: 
 At the top of the form, mark whether the
 patient is on m edication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease 
and, if on levodopa, the time since the last dose.   
 
Also, if the patient is receiving medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, mark the patient’s 
clinical state using the following definitions:  
ON is the typical functional state when patients ar e receiving medication and have a good response.   
OFF is the typical functional state when patients hav e a poor response in spite of taking medications. 
 The investigator should “rate what you see”.  Admittedly,  concurrent medical problems such as stroke, paralysis, 
arthritis, contracture, and orthopedic problems such as hip or knee replacement and scoliosis may interfere with 
individual items in the motor examination.  In situations where it is absolutely impossible to test (e.g., amputations, 
plegia, limb in a cast), use the notation “ UR” for Unable to Rate.  Otherwise, rate the performance of each task as the 
patient performs in the context of co-morbidities. 
 
All items must have an integer rating (no half points, no missing ratings). 
 
Specific instructions are provided for the testing of each item.  These should be followed in all instances. The 
investigator demonstrates while describing tasks the patient is to perform and rates function immediately thereafter.  For Global Spontaneous Movement and Rest Tremor items (3.14 and 3.17 ), these items ha
 ve been placed 
purposefully 
at the end of the scale because clinical inform ation pertinent to the score will be obtained throughout the 
entire examination.  At the end of the rating, indicate if dy skinesia (chorea or dystonia) was present at the time of the examination, and if 
so, whether these movements interfer ed with the motor examination.  
 
 
3a   Is the patient on medication for treating the sy mptoms of Parkinson’s Disease?        

 No    
 Yes 
   
 
3b    If the patient is receiving medication for tr eating the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease,  
          mark the patient’s clin ical state using the following definitions:  
 

 ON:  On is the typical functional state when patie nts are receiving medication and have a good response.   
 

 OFF:  Off is the typical functional state when patient s have a poor response in spite of taking medications.

3.3  RIGIDITY    
 
Instructions to examiner :  Rigidity is judged on slow passive movement of major joints with the patient in 
a relaxed position and the examiner manipulating the limbs and neck.  First, test without an activation 
maneuver.  Test and rate neck and each limb separately.  For arms, test the wrist and elbow joints 
simultaneously. For legs, test the hip and knee joints  simultaneously. If no rigidity is detected, use an 
activation maneuver such as tapping fingers, fist opening/closing, or heel tapping in a limb not being 
tested. Explain to the patient to go as limp as possible as you test for rigidity.   
 
0:  Normal:   No rigidity. 
 
1:  Slight:  Rigidity only detected with activation maneuver.   
 
2:  Mild:  Rigidity detected without the acti vation maneuver, but full range of motion is easily 
achieved.  
 
3:  Moderate: Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver; full range of motion is achieved 
with effort.   
 
4:  Severe: Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver and full range of motion not 
achieved.

3.9  ARISING FROM CHAIR     
Instructions to examiner:
 Have the patient sit in a straight-backed chair with arms, with both feet on the 
floor and sitting back in the chair (if the patient is not too short).  Ask the patient to cross his/her arms 
across the chest and then to stand up.  If the patient  is not successful, repeat this attempt a maximum 
up to two more times.  If still unsuccessful, allow the patient to move forward in  the chair to arise with 
arms folded across the chest.  Allow only one attempt in this situation.  If unsuccessful, allow the patient to push off using his/her hands on the arms of the chai r.  Allow a maximum of three trials of pushing off.  
If still not successful, assist the patient to arise.  After the patient  stands up, observe the posture for item 
3.13  
0:  Normal:  No problems. Able to arise quickly without hesitation.   1:  Slight: Arising is slower than normal ; or may need more than one attempt; or may 
need to move forward in the chair to arise.  No need to use the arms of the chair.  
 
2:  Mild:  Pushes self up from arms of chair without difficulty. 
 3:  Moderate:   Needs to push off, but tends to fall back; or may have to try more than one time 
using arms of chair, but can get up without help. 
 4:  Severe:   Unable to arise without help.  SCORE 
 
 

  
 
3.10  GAIT         
Instructions to examiner:
  Testing gait is best performed by having the patient walking away from and 
towards the examiner so that both right and left sides of the body can be easily observed 
simultaneously.  The patient should walk at least 10 meters (30 feet), then turn around and return to the 
examiner. This item measures multiple behaviors: stride amplitude, stride speed, height of foot lift, heel 
strike during walking, turning, and arm swing, but not freezing. Assess also for “freezing of gait” (next 
item 3.11) while patient is walking.    Observe posture for item 3.13 
 
0:  Normal:   No problems. 
 
1:  Slight:  Independent walking with minor gait impairment.    
  
2:  Mild:  Independent walking but with substantial gait impairment.  
 
3:  Moderate:   Requires an assistance device for safe walking (walking stick, walker) but not a 
person.   
 
4: Severe:  Cannot walk at all or only with another person’s assistance.

3.11  FREEZING OF GAIT  
Instructions to examiner:
  While assessing gait, also assess for the presence of any gait freezing 
episodes.  Observe for start hesitation and stuttering movements especially when turning and reaching the end of the task.  To the extent  that safety permits, patients may NOT use sensory tricks during the 
assessment.   
 
0:  Normal:           No freezing. 
 
1:  Slight:              Freezes on starting, tu rning or walking through doorway with a single halt during 
any of these events, but t hen continues smoothly without freezing during straight 
walking. 
 
2:  Mild:                 Freezes on starting, turning or walking through doorway with more than one halt 
during any of these activities, but c ontinues smoothly without freezing during 
straight walking.

 3.12 POSTURAL STABILITY    
   
Instructions to examiner
:  The test examines the response to sudden body displacement produced by a 
quick, forceful  pull on the shoulders while the patient is  standing erect with eyes open and feet 
comfortably apart and parallel to each other.  Test  retropulsion.  Stand behind the patient and instruct 
the patient on what is about to happen. Explain that s/he is allowed to take a step backwards to avoid 
falling. There should be a solid wall behind the examiner, at least 1-2 meters away to allow for the observation of the number of retropulsive steps. The first pull is an instructional demonstration and is purposely milder and not rated.  The second time the shoulders are pulled briskly and forcefully towards 
the examiner with enough force to displace the cent er of gravity so that patient MUST take a step 
backwards.  The examiner needs to be ready to catch t he patient, but must stand sufficiently back so as 
to allow enough room for the patient to take severa l steps to recover independently.  Do not allow the 
patient to flex the body abnormally forward in antici pation of the pull.  Observe for the number of steps 
backwards or falling.  Up to and including two steps for recovery is considered normal, so abnormal 
ratings begin with three steps.  If the patient fails to understand the test, the examiner can repeat the 
test so that the rating is based on an assessment that the examiner feels reflects  the patient’s limitations 
rather than misunderstanding or lack of prepar edness.  Observe standing posture for item 3.13 
 
0:  Normal:  No problems:  Recovers with one or two steps.   
 
1:  Slight:  3-5 steps, but subject recovers unaided.   
 
2:  Mild: More than 5 steps, but subject recovers unaided. 
 
3:  Moderate: Stands safely, but with absence of  postural response; falls if not caught by 
examiner. 
 
4:  Severe:  Very unstable, tends to lose bal ance spontaneously or with just a gentle pull on 
the shoulders.  
  
Page 24   July 1, 2008   
3.13  POSTURE  
   
Instructions to examiner : Posture is assessed with the patient st anding erect after arising from a chair, 
during walking , and while being tested for postural refl exes.  If you notice poor posture, tell the patient 
to stand up straight and see if the posture improves (see option 2 below).  Rate the worst posture seen in these three observation points.  Observe for flexion and side-to-side leaning.  
 
0:  Normal:  No problems. 
 
1:  Slight:   Not quite erect, but posture could be normal for older person. 
 
2:  Mild:   Definite flexion, scoliosis or leaning to one side, but patient can correct posture to 
normal posture when asked to do so.  
 3:   Moderate: Stooped posture, scoliosis or leaning to one side that cannot be corrected 
volitionally to a normal posture by the patient.  
 
4: Severe: Flexion, scoliosis or leanin g with extreme abnormality of posture.

3.14  GLOBAL SPONTANEITY OF MOVEMENT (BODY BRADYKINESIA) 
 Instructions to examiner
:  This global rating combines all observations on slowness, hesitancy, and 
small amplitude and poverty of movement in general, including a reduction of gesturing and of crossing the legs.  This assessment is based on the exam iner’s global impression after observing for 
spontaneous gestures while sitting, and the nature of arising and walking.

Instructions to examiner :  This is tested by the finger-to-nose maneuver. With the arm starting from the 
outstretched position, have the pati ent perform at least three finger-to-nose maneuvers with each hand 
reaching as far as possible to touch the exam iner’s finger. The finger-to-nose maneuver should be 
performed slowly enough not to hide any tremor that c ould occur with very fast arm movements. Repeat 
with the other hand, rating each hand separately.  The tremor can be present throughout the movement 
or as the tremor reaches either target (nose or finger).  Rate the highest amplitude seen.

Overview and Instructions:  In this section, the rater us es historical and objective information to assess two motor 
complications, dyskinesias and motor fluctuations that incl ude OFF-state dystonia.  Use all information from patient, 
caregiver, and the examination to ans wer the six questions that summarize function over the past week including 
today.  As in the other sections, rate using only integers ( no half points allowed) and leave no missing ratings.  If the 
item cannot be rated, place UR for Unable to Rate. You will need to choose some answers based on percentages, 
and therefore you will need to establis h how many hours generally are awake hours and use this figure as the 
denominator for “OFF” time and Dyskinesias.  For “OFF dy stonia”, the total “Off” time will be the denominator.    
Operational definitions for examiner’s use.    
Dyskinesias: Involuntary random movements 
Words that patients often recognize for dyskinesias include “irre gular jerking”, “wiggling”, “twi tching”.  It is essential to 
stress to the patient the difference between dyskinesia s and tremor, a common error when patients are assessing 
dyskinesias .   
 
Dystonia: contorted posture, oft en with a twisting component:   
Words that patients often recognize for dystoni a include “spasms”, “cramps”, “posture”.   
 Motor fluctuation:  Variable response to medication:  
Words that patients often recognize for motor fluctuation in clude “wearing out”, “wearing off”, “roller-coaster effect”, 
“on-off”,  “uneven medication effects”.   
 
OFF:  Typical functional state when pati ents have a poor response in spite of ta king mediation or the typical functional 
response when patients are on NO treatment for parkinsonism.  Words that patients often recognize include “low 
time”, “bad time”, “shaking time”, “slow ti me”, “time when my medications don’t work.” 
 
ON:  Typical functional state when patients are receiving medication and have a good response:  
Words that patients often recognize include “good time”,  “walking time”, “time when my medications work.”

4.1 TIME SPENT WITH DYSKINESIAS  
Instructions to examiner:
  Determine the hours in the usual  waking day and then the hours of 
dyskinesias.  Calculate the percenta ge.  If the patient has dyskinesias in the office, you can point them 
out as a reference to ensure that patients and caregivers understand what they are rating. You may also 
use your own acting skills to enact the dyskinetic mo vements you have seen in the patient before or 
show them dyskinetic movements typical of other pat ients.  Exclude from this question early morning 
and nighttime painful dystonia.  Instructions to patient [and caregiver].

movements?  Do not count the times when you have tremor, which is a regular back and forth shaking 
or times when you have painful foot  cramps or 
 spasms in the early mo rning or at nighttime.  I will ask 
about those later.   Concentrate only on these types of wigg ling, jerking and irregular movements.  Add

4.2 FUNCTIONAL IMPACT OF DYSKINESIAS  
 
Instructions to examiner:   Determine the degree to which dyskinesias impact on the patient’s daily 
function in terms of activities and social interactions.  Use the patient’s and caregiver’s response to your 
question and your own observations during the o ffice visit to arrive at the best answer.  
  Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:
 Over the past week, did you usually have trouble doing things or 
being with people when these jerking movements occurred?  Did they stop you from doing things or from being with people? 
 
0:  Normal: No dyskinesias or no impact by dyskinesias on activities or social interactions.  
1:  Slight: Dyskinesias impact on a few acti vities, but the patient usually performs all 
activities and participates in all social interactions during dyskinetic periods.   
 2:  Mild: Dyskinesias impact on many activi ties, but the patient usually performs all 
activities and participates in all social interactions during dyskinetic periods.    
 3:  Moderate: Dyskinesias impact on activities to the point that the patient usually does not 
perform some activities or does not usually participate in some social activities 
during dyskinetic episodes.    
 
4:  Severe: Dyskinesias impact on function to the point that the patient usually does not 
perform most activities or participate in most social interactions during dyskinetic episodes.

4.3  TIME SPENT IN THE OFF STATE   
Instructions to examiner:
  Use the number of waking hours deri ved from 4.1 and determine the hours 
spent in the “OFF” state.  Calcul ate the percentage.  If the patient has an OFF period in the office, you 
can point to this state as a reference. You may al so use your knowledge of the patient to describe a 
typical OFF period.  Additionally you may use y our own acting skills to enact an OFF period you have 
seen in the patient before or show them OFF function  typical of other patients.  Mark down the typical 
number of OFF hours, because you will need this number for completing 4.6   Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:     Some patients with Parkinson's disease have a good effect 
from their medications throughout their awake hours and we call that “ON” time.   Other patients take their medications but still have some hours of low ti me, bad time, slow time or shaking time.  Doctors 
call these low periods “OFF” time. Ov er the past week, you told me before that you are generally awake  
____ hrs each day. Out of these awake hours,  how many  hours in total do you usually have this type of 
low level or OFF function  ____ (Use this number for your calculations). 
 0:  Normal:   No OFF time. 
 
1:  Slight:  ≤ 25% of waking day. 
 
2:  Mild: 26 - 50% of waking day. 
 
3:  Moderate: 51 - 75% of waking day. 
 
4:  Severe: > 75% of waking day.

can point to this state as a reference. You may al so use your knowledge of the patient to describe a 
typical OFF period.  Additionally you may use y our own acting skills to enact an OFF period you have 
seen in the patient before or show them OFF function  typical of other patients.  Mark down the typical 
number of OFF hours, because you will need this number for completing 4.6

4.4  FUNCTIONAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS   
Instructions to examiner:
  Determine the degree to which motor fluctuations impact on the patient’s daily 
function in terms of activities and social interact ions.  This question concentrates on the difference 
between the ON state and the OFF state.  If the pat ient has no OFF time, the rating must be 0, but if 
patients have very mild fluctuations, it is still possible to be rated 0 on th is item if no impact on activities 
occurs. Use the patient’s and caregiver’s response to your question and your own observations during 
the office visit to arrive at the best answer.    Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:
 Think about when those low or “OFF” periods have occurred over 
the past week.  Do you usually have more problems doing things or being with people than compared to the rest of the day when you feel your medicati ons working? Are there some things you usually do 
during a good period that you have trouble with or stop doing during a low period?  
0:  Normal: No fluctuations or No impact by  fluctuations on performance of activities or 
social interactions.  
 
1:  Slight: Fluctuations impact on a few acti vities, but during OFF, the patient usually 
performs all activities and participates in all social interactions that typically 
occur during the ON state.   
 2:  Mild: Fluctuations impact many activiti es, but during OFF, the patient still usually 
performs all activities and participates in all social interactions that typically 
occur during the ON state.   
 
3:  Moderate: Fluctuatio
ns impact on the performan ce of activities during OFF to the point that 
the patient usually does not perform some activities or participate in some social interactions that are performed during ON periods.    
   
4:  Severe: Fluctuations impact on function to the point that, during OFF, the patient usually 
does not perform most activities or partic ipate in most social interactions that 
are performed during ON periods.

 4.5  COMPLEXITY OF MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS  
 
Instructions to examiner:
  Determine the usual predictability of OFF function whether due to dose, time 
of day, food intake or other factors.  Use the information provid ed by the patients and caregiver and 
supplement with your own observations. You will ask if the patient can count on them always coming at 
a special time, mostly coming at a special time (in wh ich case you will probe furt her to separate slight 
from mild), only sometimes coming at a special time  or are they totally unpredictable?   Narrowing down 
the percentage will allow you to find the correct answer.   Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:
  For some patients, the low or “OFF” periods happen at  certain 
times during day or when they do activities like eati ng or exercising. Over the past week, do you usually 
know when your low periods will occur?  In other words, do your low periods always  come at a certain 
time?  Do they mostly  come at a certain time? Do they only sometimes  come at a certain time?  Are 
your low periods totally unpredictable?”  
0:  Normal: No motor fluctuations.  
 
1:  Slight:   OFF times are predictable all or almost all of the time (> 75%). 
 
2:  Mild:   OFF times are predictable most of the time (51-75%). 
 
3:  Moderate: OFF times are predictable some of the time (26-50%).  
4: Severe: OFF episodes are rarely predictable. (<
 25%).

4.6  PAINFUL OFF-STATE DYSTONIA   
 
Instructions to examiner :  For patients who have motor fluctuat ions, determine what proportion of the 
OFF episodes usually includes painful dystonia? Y ou have already determined the number of hours of 
“OFF” time (4.3). Of these hours, determine how ma ny are associated with dy stonia and calculate the 
percentage.  If there is no OFF time, mark 0. 
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:    In one of the questions I asked earlier, you said you generally 
have ___ hours of low or “OFF” time when your Parkinso n's disease is under poor control.  During these 
low or “OFF” periods, do you usually have painful cramps or spasms?  Out of the total ____ hrs of this 
low time, if you add up all the time in a day when these painful cramps come, how many hours would 
this make?  
 
0:  Normal:  No dystonia OR NO OFF TIME.    
1:  Slight: < 25% of time in OFF state.  
2:  Mild:  26-50% of time in OFF state. 
 3:  Moderate: 51-75% of time in OFF state.  
 
4:  Severe: > 75% of time in OFF state. 
  
Summary statement to patient :  READ TO PATIENT 
 This completes my rating of your Parkinson’s disease.  I know the questions and tasks have taken several minutes, 
but I wanted to be complete and cover all possibilities. In  doing so, I may have asked about problems you do not even 
have, and I may have mentioned problems that you may never develop at all.  Not all patients develop all these 
problems, but because they can occur, it is important to ask all the questions to every patient.  Thank you for your time 
and attention in completing this scale with me.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must  ask about all types)  Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results , 
this is considered a n attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. , gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yours elf? 
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possibl e you could have died from _____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, 
or get something else to happen)?   (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

□   □ 
Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather  than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: P erson has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they  pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down fr om ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck 
but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.  
Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you 
actually did anything?  
If yes, describe:   
Yes      No

Aborted Attempt:   
When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attempt, but stops themselves before they actually have engaged in a ny self-destructive behavior. 
Examples are similar to interrupted attem pts, except that the individual stops him/herself, instead of being stopped by something else.  
Has there been a time when you started to do something to try to end your life but you stopped yourself before you actually d id 
anything?

Preparatory Acts or Behavior:  
Acts or preparation towards imminently making a suicide attempt. This can include anything beyond a verbalization or thought,  such as assembling a specific 
method (e.g. , buying pills, purchas ing a gun) or preparing for one’s death by suicide (e.g. , giving things away, writing a suicide note).  
Have you taken any steps towards making a suicide attempt or preparing to kill yourself (such as collecting pills, getting a gun, 
giving valuables away or writing a suicide note )?

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0  
Likely lethality of act ual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medical damage, 
had potential for very serious lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage;  
laying on train tracks with oncom ing train but pulled away before run over).  
0 = Behavior not likely to result in injury  
1 = Behavior likely to result in injury but not likely to cause death  
2 = Behavior likely to result in death despite available medical care

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must  ask about all types ) Since Last 
Visit 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire t o die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results , 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a highly 
lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but sui cide can be inferred (e.g. , gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). 
Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done any thing to harm yourself?   
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, g et 
sympathy, or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior witho ut suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circums tance) from starting the potentially self -injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather  than an interrupted  attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger . Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grab bed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

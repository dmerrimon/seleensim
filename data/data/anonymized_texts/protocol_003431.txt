        Study Title : A Randomized-Controlled trial comparing long-acting and short- acting local anesthetics at the time 
of penile prosthesis placement.  Protocol version number an
 d date: Version 2; July 21, 2021     
 
Research Question and Aims  
 Hypothesis:  Local anesthesia with liposomal bupivacaine administered at the time of penile prosthesis placement will reduce postoperative opioid use and decrease post -operative pain when compared with  administration of  ropiva caine.  
 Aims, purpose, or objectives: 
This study aims to determine if  using liposomal bupivacaine, when compared  with  ropivacaine, for 
postoperative pain control in patients  undergoing surgical placement of a 3- piece inflatable penile prosthesis is 
associated with less overall opioid use and lower postoperative pain scores during the early postoperative period. Variables to be analyzed will include pre- and postoperative pain and anxiety scores, in-hospital (if-applicable) and home opioid use postoperatively, and adverse intraoperative, periope rative, and  postoperative 
events.   Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):   Note: If this study establishes a human specimen repository (biobank) for research

  The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, with prescription-related drug deaths at an all 
time high  over the last decade. Surgeons are responsible for a significant proportion of opioid prescribing for 
postoperative pain control, and it is estimated that 2 -6% of patients who receive opioids postoperatively may go 
on to develop persistent use or dependence.[1,2] To this end, urology has been at the forefront in attempts to 
develop extended recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols to optimize pain control while minimizing the need for opioid medications.   Penile prosthesis placement is considered the gold standard for the management of men with medication -refractory erectile dysfunction (ED). It is associated with high levels of patient and partner 
satisfaction and restores the ability for a patient to engage in satisfactory sexual activity. [3] Multiple 
innovations in device technology and operative approach have minimized adverse events such as device infection and mechanical malfunction, making this a highly effective and reproducible treatment for men with severe ED.[4] The  procedure itself can be associated with significant perioperative and postoperative pain due 
to the high density of pain receptors located within the penis, scrotum, and inguinal regions. Historically, many prosthetic surgeons have compensated for this by prescribing large quantities of opioids to be used for breakthrough pain. However, in the e ra of increasing  awareness regarding the negative effects of opioid 
medications, there has been renewed interest in alternative pain control regimens. For example, Lucas et al found that postoperative pain scores and opioid use were significantly lower in patients who underwent penile prosthesis placement with a multi-modal pain regimen that included acetaminophen, meloxicam or  celecoxib, 
and gabapentin and intraoperative dorsal and pudendal nerve blocks with lidocaine/bupivacaine.[5] This and another novel approaches are appealing, but clinical experience has revealed short -comings with pain control 
regimens based on short- acting local anesthetics such as lidocaine/bupivacaine, wherein the local effects  may 
wane within several hours. Neuroleptics including gabapentin are also suboptimal due to untoward side- effects 
including sedation and even adverse anesthesia events su ch as prolonged sedation requiring a longer stay in the 
postoperative recovery unit.  For these reasons, a longer- activing local anesthetic is particularly appealing from 
both safety and efficacy perspectives.   Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is a long-acting local anesthetic that has been shown to promote local pain control in the postoperative period for up to 72 hours, as compared to traditional local anesthetic agents with half-lives ranging from 1-6 hours. The prolonged pain control duration is the result of suspending the 
bupivacaine within a lipid vessel that creates slow release of the medication within tissues over time. Within the realm of urology very few studies have assessed outcomes in patients who recei ve perioperative LB . A study by 
Cotta et al from 2016 retrospectively explored their experience with LB (n=13) compared with those receiving local bupivacaine (n=24) for anesthesia during penile prosthesis placement.[6] The authors found that patients receiving LB used significantly fewer opioids postoperatively. Two additional studies by Alom et al and Ziegelmann et al  described LB for use with office-based surgical procedures involving the penis and scrotum, 
although outcomes related to pain control were not specifically evaluated.[ 7,8] Finally, a recent study by 
Taniguchi and Mulhall showed that LB did not adversely impact system ic hemodynamics when administered 
within the corpora cavernosa of patients at the time of penile prosthesis placement, supporting the safety of this medication in the perioperative setting .[9] 
 It has been our experience that LB optimizes pain control in the postoperative setting when administered at the time of penile prosthesis placement.  This has become a routine part of clinical practice.  However, LB 
results in added expense, and to date there has never been an adequately powered prospective study comparing outcomes between LB and other shorter- acting local anesthestics  to determine if this added expense is justified. 
Therefore, we intend to assess perioperative and postoperative outcomes including safety and pain control in patients who receive local anesthesia with LB versus ropivacaine at the time of penile prosthesis placement.

Study Design and Methods  
 
Methods :  Describe in lay terms , completely detailing the research activities that will be conducted by Mayo 
Clinic staff under this protocol . 
 A single-blind, randomized study will be conducted in those patients who are undergoing 3- piece 
inflatable penile prosthesis placement for medication refractory erectile dysfunction by three fellowship- trained 
urologic prosthetic surgeons at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. Study and surgical informed consent will be obtained preoperatively from those patients who are interesting in participating in the study and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
 Study participants will be randomized to one of two study arms. Arm 1 will receive 40 mL of ropivicaine to be used for local anesthetic infiltration. Arm 2 will receive 40 mL of Liposomal bupivacaine (20 mL Exparel + 10 mL 0.25% bupivacaine) to be used for local anesthetic infiltration. The patient will be blinded to which study arm he is randomized to, but the surgeon will be aware (i.e. single blind). The specific agent (determined by study randomization) will be ordered by the performing surgeon through the “prep for case” inflatable penile prosthesis order set within EPIC. Two standardized order set s will be shared amongst the three 
performing surgeons and will also  include standardized perioperative medication administration per a 
previously published enhanced recovery protocol (see reference #5 – Lucas et al) . 
 Local anesthetic will be administered via a standard protocol at the time of penile prosthesis surgery. The block itself  will include pudendal, scrotal, dorsal penile, and inguinal nerve blocks . The remainder of the 
penile prosthesis surgery will be per standard practice , with all surgeons currently utilizing a similar penoscrotal

 approach . Of note, patients who currently receive intraoperative LB routinely wear a disposable bracelet with 
information for medical professionals regarding the recent receipt of this medication. This is worn for 72-96 
hours postoperatively. For the study protocol, we will work with the perioperative nursing team to apply a similar bracelet describing the research study and acknowledging that each patient may have received LB versus ropivacaine during the surgery.   If the study coordinator is unable to meet with the patient to review consent, they will be a digital consent via email. The patient will be contacted by telephone and read a script about study participation. Patients will then have the ability to sign the consent form with their personal device. These digital consent forms will be stored in Ptrax.  
 If patients  decide to consent digitally, they will be asked to complete the baseline requirements over the 
phone. These documents are the baseline anxiety inventory and the pain catastrophizing scale which will be recorded by the study coordinator.   Preoperative patient data including pertinent demographics as well as a baseline anxiety inventory and pain catastrophizing scale will be collected.  They will also receive a medication log to track their narcotic intake 
until post-operative day 14. The patients will be followed -up by phone call or through electronic 
correspondence ( RedCap ) on post- operative day s 3, 7, and 14. Participants in the study will be allowed to 
completed the questionnaires through RedCap with a +/ - 2 day allowance on completion to avoid any study 
deviation. This  follow-up will be obtained by the performing surgeons and/or the research office coor dinator . At 
these planned follow-up intervals, patients will be evaluated using the Visual Analog  Pain  Scale (daily 
maximum and minimum)  and visual analogue anxiety scale (daily maximum and minimum). In addition their 
pain control regimen ( quantities of  Tylenol, anti -inflammatories, and opioid pain medication) will be analyzed.  
Patients will be instructed to maintain a log of minimum and maximum daily pain scores and daily medication use. They will also be instructed to bring their medication bottles to their 3 week follow -up. Patient satisfaction 
with overall postoperative pain control will be measured based on subjective response. Finally, the duration of local anesthetic effect will be measured based on patient report.   
 
Subject Information  
 Target accrual is the p roposed total number of subjects to be included in this study at Mayo Clinic. A “Subject” 
may include medical records, images, or specimens  generated at Mayo Clinic and/or received from external 
sources .    
 Target accrual:  130 patients (65 patients in each treatment arm) – this accounts for the necessary statistical 
power plus an anticipated approximately 20% dropout rate.  Subject population (children, adults, groups):  Patients with medication -refractory erectile dysfunction 
undergoing penile prosthesis placement at Mayo Clinic in Rochester by Drs. Ziegelmann, Helo,  and Kohler. 
 Inclusion Criteria :  
1. Men undergoing 3- piece inflatable penile prosthesis placement  under general anesthesia at Mayo Clinic 
- Rochester  
2. ≥ 18 years old  
 Exclusion Criteria:

 1. History of opioid exposure within the preceding 90 days prior to surgery (based on patient-report, 
review of the electronic medical record, and NMP prescribing datab ase review ) 
2. Current or prior history of alcohol or drug abuse (illicit or prescription)  
3. History of chronic pain conditions (chronic musculoskeletal pain, fibromyalgia, central sensitization, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, etc.) 
4. History of cardiac arrhythmia or untreated severe cardiovascular disease  
5. Uncontrolled hypertension 
6. Hepatic insufficiency  
7. Renal insufficiency (CKD stage IIIa or greater)  
8. Current anti- platelet or anti-coagulation therapy with plans to continue at the time of prosthesis 
placement  
9. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (defined as HgbA1c > 8.5 within 30 days of surgery) 
10. Concurrent adjunctive operative procedures planned at the time of penile prosthesis placement (examples: male urethral sling, Peyronie’s disease straightening with penile plication or incision/grafting) 
11. Concurrent non-prosthetic surgery planned at the time of penile prosthesis placement  (examples: 
circumcision, hernia repair, hydrocelectomy, etc.) 
12. Planned infrapubic or subcoronal incision at the time of penile prosthesis placement 
13. Patients who will be undergoing prosthesis placement using local, monitored, or spinal anesthesia (i.e. non-general anesthesia)  
14. Allergy or history of intolerance to any local anesthetic agent s included in the protocol 
15. History of prior penile prosthesis or artificial urinary sphincter surgery  
16. Revision penile prosthesis surgery 
 Study Feasibility: At Mayo Clinic – Rochester, we perform approximately 200 penile prosthesis procedures per year amongst the three prosthetic surgeons, of which an estimated 90% are primary prosthesis placements. The majority of patients who are candidate s for penile prosthesis placement will meet our inclusion criteria. Given 
that we will be comparing administration of two local anesthetics that are generally considered as standard of care, and the fact that our study protocol involves minimal additional time commitment on the part of the patient participants, we anticipate a high rate of patient willingness to participate in the trial. We anticipate study dropout to approach approximately 20%. Therefore, we estimate the study duration inclusive of patient accrual, data collection, and statistical analysis to be approximately 24 months.

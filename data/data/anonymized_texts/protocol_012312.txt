Study Protocol  
The study will take 3-6 months and will consist of the following:  
● Participants will complete a 1.5 hour enrollment session including the informed consent 
process, self-report questionnaires, phone set-up, and a phone usage and safety briefing.  
● Over the course of 3 months, participants will have access to automated self -help 
interventions designed as a kit of smartphone tools , which are based on principles of 
cognitive-behavioral therapy . Participants will also have access to three services that will 
connect them with a real person if they need emotional support.  
● Participants will have the opportunity to complete two optional 30 -minute interviews at 2 
weeks and 4 weeks into the study period.  
● Participants will also be asked to complete a daily survey and rate a daily tip via a mobile 
app. 
● At the 3-month point of the intervention, participants will be asked to complete another 
series of self-report questionnaires. If these questionnaires are completed with valid 
responses, participants will receive another 3 months of paid phone service and study 
participation will be extended to 6 months.  
● At the end of the 6-month period, participants will be asked to complete an endpoint 
assessment consisting of self -report questionnaires. A $25 incentive will be offered for 
completing this assessment.

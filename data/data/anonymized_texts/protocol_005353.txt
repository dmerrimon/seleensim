Study Design:  
The study is designed to examine the relationship between imaging results detected on a 18F-
AV-1451 PET scan and pathology found at autopsy within six  months of imaging. Th e 
participating clinical centers  will make  an effort to enroll subjects with various levels of 
cognitive status, ranging from cognitively normal through dementia.  
Screening assessments may take place over several days and will include collection of 
demographic information, diagnostic interview, brain MRI, and safety assessments.  At the 
time of screening, subjects and/or next-of-kin will be asked to provide consent for brain donation in addition to providing informed consent for the screening and imaging procedures in the study.    
Subjects who qualify for the study will receive a single I.V. bolus of 18F-AV-1451 
followed by brain PET imaging for 20 minutes duration, beginning approximately 80 minutes post- injection.  Vital signs will be obtained prior to the administration of 
18F-
AV-1451 and at the completion of the imaging session.  Adver se events will be 
continuously monitored during the imaging session.  Subjects who experience an adverse event will not be released  until the event has been  resolved or stabilized. After the 48 
hour safety follow -up is completed subject participation in th e study will end.

Study Analysis:   
An exploratory analysis will be performed to compare the relationship of 18F-AV-1451 PET 
scan results and tau accumulation at autopsy within six months of imaging  on a regional and 
global basis. 
 
The 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging results of the 10 subjects will be analyzed on a subject  by 
subject basis.  The tau levels seen on the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan will determine which 
subjects will get high resolution brain analysis at autopsy to ensure recruited subjects have a 
full range of tau distribution.  
Assessments and Endpoints : 
Screening may take place over several days. Some screening assessments may be performed on imaging day. Assessments will include:  
• Informed consent (for clinical , imaging  and autopsy procedures); 
• Demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity, education); 
• Brief cognitive / dementia evaluation including:  
 Medical history  and concomitant medications; 
 Alzheimer’s disease history (if relevant: date/months  since symptom onset, 
date/months since diagnosis, family history of neurological disease ); 
 Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) may be obtained if the subject is able to 
cooperate with the test;  
 IQCODE will be administered to the subject’s caregiver/informant to include 
information about clinically meaningful decline in cognitive status during the ten 
years prior to the subject’s most recent illness ;  
Note: If an informant is not available to provide information for the IQCODE this 
will not necessarily result in exclusion for the subject.  
• Safety (vital signs);  
• Most recent height and weight will b e obtained from medical records;  
• Urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential); 
• Brain MRI (MRI should be performed within 2 weeks of the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan); 
and 
• A physician evaluation and summary of current medical status. 
   
18F-AV-1451 Imaging Day:  
 
The following assessments will be performed for all subjects on the imaging day : 
• Any procedure not completed during the screening visit;  
• The subject will be seen by a physician who will assess their ability to safely tolerate the 
imaging procedure;

• Females of childbearing potential will have a urine (or serum if required by local IRB ) 
pregnancy test prior to injection (the result must be negative for the subject to be 
administered 18F-AV-1451); 
• Following an I.V. bolus injection of 18F-AV-1451, 20 minutes of continuous brain PET 
imaging will begin 80 minutes post- injection;   
• Vital signs will be taken immediately prior to administration of  18F-AV-1451 and after 
completion of imaging, prior to discharge; 
• Subjects will be observed continuously for signs of adverse events (AE) or serious 
adverse events  (SAE). All AEs and SAEs wil l be followed until resolution or 
stabilization;  
• The injection site will be observed for excessive inflammation or damage to the 
surrounding tissue where the dose was injected; and  
• A physician will see the subject prior to release from the PET center  to evaluate any 
adverse events . 
 
Safety Follow-up/Phone Call: 
Each study subject (or caregiver/informant if applicable) will be contacted  2 or 3 business 
days after 18F-AV-1451 administration, but not prior to 48 hours post- injection, to collect 
any new adverse events .  End of study for the purpose of adverse event reporting and study 
participation  is defined as 48 hours after 18F-AV-1451 administration. 
 
Evaluation of Imaging: 
18F-AV-1451 PET images will have quantitative and qualitative analysis perfor med for 
regional and global distribution.  
Neuropathology Evaluation: 
All neuropathology methods and analysis will be detailed in a separate neuro pathology 
manual, which will be written prior to the first subject autopsy in this study .  
Statistical Methods:  Descriptive statistics will be applied to summarize the autopsy findings 
and tau deposition as measured by  18F-AV-1451 uptake. A correlation analysis will be 
applied to explore the relationship of tau at 18F-AV-1451 PET scan and at autopsy on a 
regional and global basis.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Molecular imaging biomarkers have the potential to aid in the diagnosi s of patients with 
cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Dubois, 2010; 
McKhann, 2011).  Positron emission tomography (PET) ligands such as florbetapir F 18 (Wong, 
2010) may provide a minimally invasive estimate of cortical beta amyloid (Aβ) neuritic plaque deposition, a hallmark pathology, and a required element for the evaluation of AD 
neuropathologic change (Hyman 2012).  Multiple studies comparing amyloid PET scans to 
histopathologic assessment of amyloid burden, in subjects for whom biopsy samples were available, or who came to autopsy after receiving a PET amyloid scan, support the relationship 
between PET amyloid imaging results and cortical neuritic plaque density (Clark 2011, 2012; 
Leinonen, 2008; Sojkova, 2011; Kantarci, 2011; Burack, 2010).  The largest of these studies (Clark 2012) demonstrated a high sensitivity and specificity for florbetapir PET to discriminate 
subjects with subsequent autopsy findings of no or sparse neuritic plaques (amyloid negative) 
from those with moderate to frequent plaques (amyloid positive).   
The ability to image brain amyloid with compounds such as florbetapir is an important advance 
for diagnosis of neurological disease.  An amyloid negative florbetapir PET scan indicates the 
absence of a hallmark pathology and is inconsistent with a diagnosis of AD.  However, because 
amyloid is believed to accumulate very early in the disease process (Jack et al., 2010) and may 
be present in other diseases or in clinically normal elderly subjects ( Sperling et al. 2011; Price 
and Morris, 1999), the density or distribution of amyloid in subjects with a positive scan is not 
associated with Alzheimer’s disease severity, has not been shown to predict rate of future 
deterioration and has not been established as a tool to predict or monitor response to therapy.   
Deposited tau is one of the defining neuropathological lesions of AD, but is also one of the 
hallmark pathologic features of other dementias, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
[Bigio 2008; Cairns 2007; Piguet 2011].  In contrast to Aβ neuritic plaques, the density and 
distribution of phosphorylated tau, aggregated in neurofibrillary tangles, increases with AD related cognitive impairment and correlates with neurodegeneration (Duyckaerts et al., 1987; 
Braak et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2012).  Thus a PET imaging agent that binds to phosphorylated 
tau has potential application as biomarker for disease severity/neurodegeneration and may be useful both for selecting patients for therapy and for monitoring disease progression in 
therapeutic trials.  
18F-AV-1451 (originally named [F-18]T807 by Siemens Molecular Imaging Biomarker Research 
group) has been developed as a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical for in vivo  imaging of tau 
protein aggregates (Xia et al., 2013).  Autoradiography results using tissue sections from human 
brains showed a strong signal in the grey matter of cortical slices from tau positive brains but weak or no binding in tau negative, Aβ positive, or tau and Aβ negative tissue.  Scatchard 
analysis based on this heterogeneous autoradiography assay yielded an estimated Kd of 15nM. A 
saturation binding experiment using purified PHF tau  isolated brains of AD patients yielded a Kd 
value of 0.7 nM. 
AV-1451 was assessed in competitive binding assays against a panel of 72 of the most common 
central nervous system (CNS) targets and no clinically relevant inhibition was seen.   AV-1451 was positive in the in vitro  hERG assay; however, in vivo cardiovascular  safety pharmacology 
assessments in dogs showed no evidence of QT prolongation at doses up to 50x the intended maximum human dose (MHD).  Nonetheless, until sufficient human cardiovascular safety data

are available, initial clinical studies will exclude subjects with a history of risk factors for 
Torsades de Pointes and subjects taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval. 
In vivo safety pharmacology studies were also conducted in rats to determine potential effects on 
the CNS and respiratory systems. In these studies no clinically relevant effects were reported at 
doses exceeding 100x the intended MHD. Additionally, non- radioactiv e AV-1451 has been 
tested in single and repeat-dose toxicology studies in rat and dog.  In each of these studies the no observable adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were the highest doses tested (150x MHD for single, 50x MHD for repeat).   
Potential genotoxic ity of non- radioactive AV -1451 was tested in both in vitro  and in vivo  assays.  
In the in vitro assays, AV-1451 tested positive for potential genotoxicity.   However, in the in 
vivo rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 750x MHD (scaled allometrically), AV -1451 showed 
no evidence of genotoxicity. The different results in the in vitro  genotoxicity assays and the in 
vivo micronucleus study are likely related to differences in the exposure conditions encountered 
by the target cells in the different test systems. In vivo , AV-1451 is cleared rapidly; however, the 
in vitro experiments employ static, prolonged exposure of cells to high concentrations of the test 
article. While the in vitro data show the potential for genotoxicity, the in vivo  data provide 
assurance that genotoxicity is unlikely to occur at clinically -relevant doses for human diagnostic 
studies. 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects.  Generally, the radiotracer distribution was 
consistent among the subjects and showed rapid hepatobiliary clearance.  There were three 
organs that received estimated doses higher than 0.05 mSv/MBq. The organ that received the 
largest estimated dose was the upper large intestinal wall (0.0962 ± 0.0134 mSv/MBq), followed by the small intestine and the liver.  T he Effective Dose was 0.0241 ± 0.0016 mSv/MBq. This 
results in an estimated Effective Dose of 8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and florbetapir F 18 injection. 
Preliminary analyses of human 18F-AV-1451 PET images from human subjects have shown little 
accumulation of tracer in young subject, accumulation largely limited to medial temporal lobe in 
older subjects with clinically norma l cognition, and increased accumulation in cortical areas of 
amyloid positive MCI and AD subjects.  Although these preliminary results are consistent with the pattern of tau pathology previously reported in autopsy studies (Braak, 1991) and suggest 
18F-AV-1451 may be useful as a marker of tau pathology in patients with AD and other 
neurodegenerative disorders, additional studies are needed to confirm that the in vivo  18F-AV-
1451 PET signal specifically reflects brain tau accumulation .  Thus, the present study is intended 
to explore the relationship between 18F-AV-1451 PET scan signal and brain tau pathology as 
seen at autopsy.

5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1. Overall Design and Plan of Trial 
The study is designed to examine the relationship between imaging results detected on a 18F-AV-
1451 PET scan and pathology found at autopsy within six months of imaging. Up to 10 subjects 
will be enrolled and imaged with 18F-AV-1451. All subjects will be followed to autopsy. 
Approximately 5 brains will be selected for high resolution analysis.  
All subjects  and/or their LAR/next-of-kin will provide informed consent before starting any 
study procedures. 
Screening assessments may take place over several days  and will include collection of 
demographic information, diagnostic interview, brain MRI, and safety assessments.  At the time 
of screening, subjects and/or their LAR/next-of-kin will be asked to provide consent for brain 
donation in addition to providing informed consent for the screening and imaging procedures in 
the study. 
Subjects who qualify for the study will receive a single I.V. bolus of 18F-AV-1451 followed 
by brain PET imaging for 20 minutes duration, beginning approximately 80  minutes post-
injection.  Vital signs will be obtained prior to the administration of 18F-AV-1451 and at the 
completion of the imaging session.  Adverse events will be continuously monitored during 
the imaging session.  Subjects who experience an adverse event will not be released from the PET center  until the event has been  resolved or stabilized. After the 48 hour safety visit or 
follow-up phone call is completed subject participation in the study will end.  
5.2. Planned Dosage and Duration of Treatment  
5.2.1. Dosage and Administration  
18F-AV-1451: 
All subjects will receive a single IV bolus administration target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 
18F-AV-1451 Injection. 
5.2.2. Rationale for Dosages 
18F-AV-1451 will be administered IV in a radioactive dose of 370 MBq with a maximum human 
dose (MHD) limited to 20 µg of compound by weight.  This dose is 150 fold lower than the 
NOAEL observed in the rat single dose toxicity study and is 50 fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies. 
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. The results estimated an Effective Dose of 
8.92 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as FDG and florbetapir F 18 injection. 
The proposed dose has been shown to have acceptable image quality in preliminary human studies. No treatment related adverse events have been reported using this regimen .

Subjects who are taking drugs that are known to cause QT-prolongation may not be enrolled in 
the study (a list of prohibited and discouraged medications is provided by the Sponsor). 
5.5. Removal of Subjects from Trial  
Subjects must be removed from the trial if:  
1. Informed consent is withdrawn; or  
2. The investigator or the sponsor believes it is in the best interest of the subject to be 
removed from the trial. 
Subjects may be withdrawn from the trial if a serious adverse event occurs.   The date and reason 
for discontinuation should be noted on the e CRF. 
5.6. Premature Termination of Trial/Closure of Center  
The sponsor may discontinue the trial at any time.  Reasons for discontinuation of the trial may 
include, but are not limited to, new information on safety or efficacy, reques ts from regulatory 
authorities, or changes in business priorities.  Additional reasons for center closure may include, 
but are not limited to, excessive protocol violations, inadequate regard for subject safety, failure 
to follow recommended procedures (e.g., documentation), failure or inability to accommodate 
Avid/CRO monitors or to provide required access to data and source documents, staff turnover or inadequate staffing, and inadequate enrollment.  Except in cases affecting subject safety, the 
investigators will be given a minimum of 30 days to complete final study evaluations for 
ongoing subjects.  In all cases of center or study termination, appropriate steps will be taken to 
ensure the safety of study subjects. 
6. WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS  
The most up- to-date and complete information regarding the use of 18F-AV-1451 Injection can 
be found in the investigator's brochure.  
In brief, 18F-AV-1451 Injection is an experimental imaging agent that will be used at relatively 
low (tracer) doses.  However, because relatively little toxicological evaluation has been 
completed, and because  18F-AV-1451 Injection is in the early stages of clinical investigation, it 
is recommended that subjects receiving  18F-AV-1451 Injection be followed closely by means of 
adverse event reporting and vital signs. 
There are no data on the effects of 18F-AV-1451 Injection in human perinatal development. Both 
females and males must use adequate contraceptive methods for 90 days after administration of 
18F-AV-1451 Injection.  18F-AV-1451 Injection must not be administered to females who are 
pregnant or lac tating.

7.1.3. Safety Follow- up/Phone Call: 
Each study subject (or caregiver/informant if applicable) will be contacted 2 or 3 business days 
after 18F-AV-1451 administration, but not prior to 48 hours post- injection, to collect any new 
adverse events.   End of study for the purpose of adverse event reporting  and study participation  
is defined as 48 hours after 18F-AV-1451 administration. 
7.2. Observations and Measurements  
Autopsy: 
For those subjects who come to autopsy within six  months of imaging, neuropathological 
examination will be conducted according to a separate neuropathology manual, which will be 
written prior to the first subject autopsy in this study . Cases not included in the high-resolution 
autopsy study will be banked until the time of study conclusion. At this time, a clinical autopsy 
may be conducted and a clinical autopsy report provided to the subject’s physician. 
Brain tissue will be maintained at the Grinberg Lab/UCSF until 2 years after the study is 
completed for study purposes. After that period of time, brain tissue will be placed in a 
biospecimen repository located at the Grinsberg Lab/UCSF for future research studies. Approved research studies may be conducted at the VA, other Federal health agencies, academic 
institutions, or for-profit organizations.  Brain tissue will only be provided to researchers in a 
coded manner so that they will not be able to identify participants. If participant does  not consent 
to allow his/her brain tissue to be placed into this biospecimen repository, he/she cannot 
participate in this study.  
Informed Consent 
Potential subjects and legally authorized representatives, if applicable, will be allowed to read a written informed consent form.  The site principal investigator or designee will explain all study 
procedures, risks, and alternative therapies to subject.  The subject will have an opportunity to have all questions answered.  The appropriate parties will then sign and date the informed 
consent form, indicating willingness to participate in the study (see Section 7.5). A copy of the 
signed informed consent will be given to the subject or legally authorized representative.  
All informed consent forms must be approved by Avid or designee, and by the appropriate 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to use. 
 
IQCODE – Short Version (Jorm, 1994) 
Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) is a tool used to assess 
cognitive impairment in older people. IQCODE will be administered  to subject’s 
caregiver/ informant during screening. 
 
Medical History, Neurologic Disease History  
The investigator or designee will obtain a case history at the screening visit. 
• Relevant demographic information  
• Medical and surgical history

• Concurrent medications  
• Alzheimer’s d isease history (month and year of symptom onset, month and year of diagnosis, 
family history of neurologic disease)  
Whenever possible, the medical history will be confirmed by medical records. 
Documentation of the events leading up to death will be collected.  
 
MRI 
The screening  brain MRI should be obtained within 2 weeks of the 18F-AV-1451 PET scan. A 
second brain MRI will be taken post- mortem to help  correct for brain deformations when co-
registering histology and PET scan data. The post-mortem MRI can be done in vivo or in a 3D 
printed skull. The MRI sequences and acquisition parameters will be described in a separate 
document. Electronic copies of MRI scans will be submitted to Avid.  
Pregnancy Testing  
A urine beta- hCG test will be performed at screening and at the 18F-AV-1451 imaging visit(s) 
prior to injection for females of childbearing potential (defined as pre-menopausal, less than 2 
years post-menopausal or not surgically sterile). A serum pregnancy test may also be obtained prior to injection at the  
18F-AV-1451 imaging visit (s) if required by the local site.  
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate,  and supine blood pressure) will be taken at the following 
time points: 
• Screening Visit ; 
• Immediately prior to  the administration of 18F-AV-1451 Injection; 
• After the completion of imaging prior to discharge ;   
 
The most recent height and weight recorded in the subject’s medical records will be collected at 
screening.  
7.3. Protocol for Image Collection  
The sponsor will prepare and distribute a PET Ima ging Manual for 18F-AV-1451 as well as an 
MRI Manual.    
7.4. Good Clinical Practice and Monitoring

1. IRB/IEC approval:  An investigation will be initiated at a study site only after the 
IRB/IEC for that study site has given their written approval of the protocol and informed 
consent;    
2. Informed Consent:  Study procedures will not be initiated until the subject and/or their   
legally authorized representative (as appropriate) signs the informed consent form;   
3. Recording and monitoring of adverse events as outlined in Section 7.7 including the notification of study site clinical investigators, local IRBs an d the FDA regarding serious 
adverse event s; 
4. Avid’s obligation to monitor the participating center on a regular basis; and 
5. The termination of a center or the trial if conditions apply, as outlined in Section 5.6. 
 
7.5. Informed Consent and Subject Information  
Potential subjects, or their legally authorized representative (as appropriate), will be allowed to 
read a written informed consent form.  The site principal investigator or designee will explain all study procedures, risks, and alternative therapies.  The subject and legally authorized 
representative will have an opportunity to have all questions answered by a physician.  The 
subject will then sign and date the informed consent form, indicating willingness to participate in the study. 
Subjects with AD are po tentially a vulnerable population with compromised mental capacity.  
Investigators should take extra care to evaluate a patient’s ability to give consent.  If the subject 
is capable of giving informed consent then the subject should sign on the consent line of the 
informed consent form.  When applicable the legally authorized representative should sign as 
well, indicating that they have witnessed the subject’s consent, and further agree to participate as an informant. 
If the subject is not capable of giving consent, consent may be given by a legally authorized 
representative.  However, it is expected that all subjects entering this study should at least have the capacity to understand that they are engaging in a research study and should affirm that they 
do not object to participating, by signing on the Subject Assent line of the consent form.   
All informed consent forms must be approved by Avid or designee, and by the appropriate 
Institutional Review Board (IRB).  No study related procedures shall be performed prior to 
completion of the informed consent process, and signing of the consent form.  A copy of the 
signed informed consent should be given to the patient and/or their legally authorized representative for their records  
7.6. Documentation  
18F-AV-1451 PET s cans and MRI scans, will be saved in an appropriate electronic format as 
specified in the imaging manuals.  A copy of all scans will be saved at the site/imaging center and a copy of each will be forwarded to the sponsor or to the designated imaging core l ab as 
described in the imaging manuals.  All other data required by the protocol will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  All data in the eCRF will be substantiated by “source documents,” which consist of the 
subject’s medical files, laboratory result sheets, ECG tr acings, etc.  All source documentation

must be available to Avid and designees.  Completed source documents and eCRFs may need to 
be made available and complete for an audit by the FDA or other international regulatory 
authorities or Avid at any time.  A b allpoint pen should be used to ensure that all copies are 
legible.  eCRFs and all other records must be filed in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations (see Section 10.6) 
7.7. Adverse Events  
Avid’s standards for recording and reporting adverse events (AEs) are to be followed regardless 
of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  All AEs must be fully recorded on the Adverse Event Page of the eCRF. Investigators will be instructed to report to Avid or its 
designee their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to investigational product or 
protocol procedure via electronic data entry.  If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of 
an AE, study site personnel must clearly report to Avid or its designee via electro nic data entry 
the circumstances and data leading to any such discontinuation of treatment. In cases where the investigator notices an unanticipated benefit to the patient, study site personnel should report “unexpected benefit” with the actual event term to Avid or its designee (for example, the 
complete actual term would be “unexpected benefit - sleeping longer”).  
Laboratory test abnormalities considered by the Investigator to be clinically relevant should be reported on the Adverse Event Page of the eCRF.  Signs and symptoms of each AE should be 
described in detail (e.g., start and stop dates/time, severity/intensity, relationship to 
investigational product, action taken, and outcome).  Additionally, any clinically significant findings from laboratory evaluations, vital sign measurements, or other study procedures 
including those that result in a diagnosis should be reported as an AE to Avid or its designee. 
7.7.1. Adverse Even Monitoring  
Each patient must be carefully monitored for adverse events.  This includes clinical laboratory 
test variables.  An assessment must be made of the severity/intensity and relationship to the 
administration of the trial medication  
7.7.2. Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Events  
For reporting purposes, Avid will distinguish among pre- existing conditions, treatment -
emergent adverse events and trial -emergent adverse events.  Pre-existing conditions (i.e., 
undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms that begin prior to the Screening Visit) will be 
recorded on the medical history and/or physical exam eCRF pages.  Signs and symptoms that are 
believed to be due to the pre-existing condition (started prior to dose of study medication) do not 
have to be recorded in the AEs section of the eCRF, unless there is an increase in frequency or severity.  
In order to capture possible adverse effects of trial participation, any untoward medical 
occurrences occurring after the informed consent until the administration of 
18F-AV-1451 will be 
recorded in the CRF for reporting as t rial-emergent adverse events . 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Untoward medical occurrences will be considered associated with the use of 
18F-AV-1451, and thus be reported as adverse events, if 
LY3191748
18F-AV-1451-A13: “A High Resolution Autopsy  Study Evaluating the Relationship of 18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging 
and Tau Pathology ” 
 
14Nov2016 – Amendment 3                                 Page 23 of 32                                                       
they occur within 48 hours after 18F-AV-1451 administration. Adverse experiences that occur 
after administration of 18F-AV-1451 but outside the 48 hour reporting window will not be 
reported unless the investigator believes they are attributable  to the drug. 
The end of study for the purpose of adverse event reporting is defined as 48 hours after the last 
administration of 18F-AV-1451. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is an AE that results in one of the following outcomes or constitutes one of t he 
following events: 
• Death; 
• Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization (other than that required by protocol; 
“social hospitalization” or any hospitalization for non-medical reasons does not constitute an SAE); 
• A life-threatening experience (that is, i mmediate risk of dying);  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• Considered significant by the investigator for any other reason. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or requi re 
hospitalization may be considered serious adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
In the context of this study, death occurring after the 48 hour safety follow-up is expected and 
will not be considered a reportable SAE in the clinical or Global Patient Safety databases unless 
the investigator believes the death is caused by the investigation al product or protocol procedure. 
Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously reported or an adverse event that 
occurs with specificity, severity or frequency that is not consistent with the current investigator’ s 
brochure. 
Relationship to Investigational Product 
Investigators will be instructed to report their assessment of the potential relatedness of each 
adverse event to protocol procedure, concomitant medication and/or investigational product.  
The assessment  of the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the investigational 
product is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of 
the eCRF.  
Intensity/Severity of an Adverse Event 
In addition to assessing the relationship of the administration of the investigational product to adverse events, an assessment is required of the intensity (severity) of the event.  
The following classifications should be used: Mild:   
LY3191748
18F-AV-1451-A13: “A High Resolution Autopsy  Study Evaluating the Relationship of 18F-AV-1451 PET Imaging 
and Tau Pathology ” 
 
14Nov2016 – Amendment 3                                 Page 24 of 32                                                       
A mild adverse event is an adverse event,  usually transient in nature and generally not interfering 
with normal activities.  
Moderate :   
A moderate adverse event is an adverse event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal activities.  
Severe:   
A severe adverse event is an adverse event that incapacitates the subject and prevents normal activities.   Note that a severe event is not necessarily a serious event.  Nor must a serious event 
necessarily be severe.  
7.7.3. Adverse Event Documentation  
All adverse events must be fully recorded on the Adverse Event Page via the eCRFs.  
Documentation must be supported by an entry in the subject file.  V ital signs abnormalities 
considered by the Investigator to be clinically relevant should be reported on the Adverse Event 
page of the eCRF.  Signs and symptoms of each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop dates, severity/intensity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and outcome). 
Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities fulfilling the definition of a serious adverse 
event should, in addition, be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form 
7.7.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Study site personnel must alert Eli Lilly or its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of their 
awareness of the event via a spon sor-approved method.  Alerts issued via telephone are to be 
immediately followed with official notification on study -specific SAE forms.  
Serious adverse events occurring after a subject receives a dose of investigational product will be collected until 48  hours after the  dosing of the investigational product, regardless of the 
investigator’s opinion of causation.  Therefore, SAEs that occur later than 48 hours after the 
dosing of the investigational product are not required to be reported in the clinical or Global 
Patient Safety databases unless the investigator feels the events were related to either investigational product or a protocol procedure. 
If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving 
investigational product, the event will be reported on the eCRF and to Eli Lilly or its designee .  
Previously planned (prior to signing the ICF) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the 
underlying medical condition has worsened during the course of the study. 
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
8.1. General Statistical Considerations  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 8.2 or higher. 
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects [N], mean, standard 
deviation [SD], median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and using frequency count and percentage for discrete variables.  The demographic and baseline 
LY3191748

characteristics data will be summarized for all subjects in the safety population.  Safety data will 
be summarized for all patients.  
Subject listings of all data from the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) as well as any derived variables will be presented.  
Additional details concerning statistical analyses will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). 
8.2. Safety Analysis 
Vital signs measurements will be summarized by subject.  Change from baseline (pre- dose time 
point) values will be determined and sum marized. 
Adverse events including injection site reactions will be summarized in terms of number and 
percentage of subjects experiencing an AE.  The summary will be further broken down by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) terms.  Adverse events will also be presented by severity, relationship to treatment and seriousness.  All subjects who experience SAEs or who discontinue due to AEs will be summarized.  
Discontinuation  
All subjects who discontinued participation prior to completing the study will be listed and their discontinuation reasons will be tabulated. 
8.3. Image Analysis  
All 18F-AV-1451 PET images will be analyzed and include co -registration of the MRI to the PET 
images. The exploratory analysis will be detailed in the Image Analysis Plan.  
8.4. Primary Objective Analysis  
The relationship of tau at 18F-AV-1451 PET scan and at autopsy will be graphically displayed on 
a regional and global basis.  Pearson product correlation analysis will be applied to quantify this 
relationship, if there are no obvious outliers. If there are obvious outliers, a Spearman’s rank 
correlation analysis will be applied instead . 
8.5. Sample Size  
Due to the exploration nature of this study, the sample size was determined outside of statistical considerations. 
9. USE OF DATA AND PUBL ICATION 
Avid adheres to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and Communication of Clinical Trial Results. A complete copy of these principles is available from Avid and can also be found at the PhRMA 
website (http://www.phrma.org).  Our policy is briefly summarized below: 
• We commit to timely communication of meaningful results of controlled clinical trials, regardless of outcome.

• As a sponsor, we may recommend that the Investigator(s) delay or decline publication 
in cases where the study design, conduct, or data are insufficient to allow meanin gful 
interpretation.  Avid and the Investigator(s) will discuss the study design and data in 
advance of the study, and again after completion, and will strive, through appropriate 
scientific debate, to reach a consensus regarding the potential merits of pu blication. 
• Avid retains the right to review any manuscripts, presentations, or abstracts before they are submitted for publication. Where differences of opinion or interpretation 
exist regarding data planned for publication, the parties (Avid and the Inves tigator) 
should try to resolve them through appropriate scientific debate.  Avid retains the right to delay publication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property.  
• Anyone who provides substantial contributions should receive appropriate 
recognitio n as an author or contributor when the manuscript is published.  
 
10. INVESTIGATOR’S REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to Good Clinical Practice regulations; 
this may include an inspection by Avid and/or Health Authority representatives (FDA, EMA or international regulatory authorities) at any time.  
10.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
The intent of the research program, the trial protocol, the patient information/informed consent form and any advertising material used to recruit subjects must be submitted to the clinical investigator’s local IRB/IEC and its approval must be obtained prior to its use.  A copy of the 
approval must be forwarded to Avid.  When necessary, an extension or renewal of IRB/IEC 
approval must be obtained and also forwarded to Avid. 
10.2. Informed  Consent 
A signed, written informed consent must be obtained from each patient.  A copy of the signed informed consent should be given to the patient for their records.  A copy of the local IRB/IEC’s 
approved version of the informed consent form must be forwarded to Avid or designee for 
review prior to being used to obtain patient consent. 
10.3. Protocol Adherence  
The protocol must be read thoroughly and the instructions must be followed exactly.  Where a 
deviation occurs, it must be documented, the sponsor/monitor informed, and a course of action 
agreed upon. 
10.4. Documents Necessary for Initiation of the Trial  
Avid must be provided with the following documents prior to the enrollment of any subjects: 
• Original signed and dated Statement of Agreement page; 
• Copy of the IRB/IEC and radiation safety committee approval (if applicable);

• Copy of the IRB/IEC stamped approved consent form; 
• Name and location of the laboratory utilized for laboratory assays, and other facilities 
conducting tests, including laboratory certification number and date of certification if 
available.  Avid may be responsible for supplying these to the investigator if a central laboratory is used;  
• List of reference range laboratory values.  Avid may be responsible for this if a central laboratory is used; and  
• Any additional licenses required in order to order to use 
18F-AV-1451. 
10.5. Investigational Product Control  
The receipt of clinical supplies must be documented at the site.  
All drug supplies for this trial should be retained in a safe and secure place at all times during the trial.  
18F-AV-1451 Injection should be prepared by a qualified PET manufacturing site and 
administered by a qualified individual under the investigator’s supervision.  An up- to-date drug 
inventory/dispensing record must be maintained.  All drug supplies must be accounted for.  After completion of the trial, all remaining clinical supplies must be r eturned to the sponsor or their 
representative 
10.6. Data Collection  
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be used for this trial.  Individual patient files should include appropriate source documents, including but not limited to patient’s medical records.  The files should include information such as visit dates, records of medical history, examinations 
administered, vital signs, concomitant treatment, any adverse event encountered and other notes 
as appropriate.  These constitute “source data”.  All entries on the eCRFs must be backed up by source data.  Original electronic versions of imaging studies are also considered source data and 
should be kept on file by the site/imaging center, and appropriate copies should be forwarded to 
Avid or a designated Imaging Core Lab as specified in the Imaging Manual.   
Each patient’s source file should include an original signed informed consent form.  When the 
trial is completed, the informed consent form should be kept on file with other trial related 
records. 
The eCRF s must be kept in order and up- to-date so that they always reflect the latest 
observations on the subjects that are enrolled in the trial.  The eCRFs must be completed for each patient enrolled in the trial and signed by the investigator.  This should be done as soon as possible after completion of the patient’s participation in the trial.  A monitor will verify the 
source data for all information on the eCRF. 
10.7. Adverse Events  
All adverse events encountered during the clinical trial must be documented on the eCRF, 
whether or not considered drug- related. 
Eli Lilly must be notified immediately (as soon as possible, and in all cases within 24 hours) of a drug experience, condition, development, or event, which is considered serious. Eli Lilly must be notified immediately of any findings with the use of the drug that may suggest significant

hazards, contraindications, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and precautions pertinent to the safety 
of the drug.  The investigator will be requested to complete a separate report form in addition to 
the information on the eCRF.  See section 7.7.4 for reporting serious adverse events 
If an SAE is determined to be unexpected (not previously reported or described by Avid), and 
study drug- related, Eli Lilly will notify the investigator  in writing.  The investigator should 
forward this notification to the IRB/IEC within 24 hours of receipt. 
10.8. Records Retention  
All correspondence (e.g., with Avid, IRB/IEC, etc.) relating to this clinical trial should be kept in appropriate file folders.  Records of subjects, source documents, and drug inventory sheets 
pertaining to the trial must be kept on file.  Records must be retained until the date a marketing 
application (NDA) is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated, or until 3 years following the date of clinical trial termination or completion, whichever is later.   
If no application is to be filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, records 
should be kept until 3 years following the date o f clinical trial termination or completion.  
If an investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for 
maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who will accept the responsibility.  
Notice of transfer m ust be made to and agreed upon by Avid.

Revision  
section 4.21 and section 4.22 – add “known” before hepatitis 
and HIV  
section 6.2 – paragraph beginning with “Four to six hours after 
discharge” delete last sentence as it makes no sense.  
Section 11.3 – delete ‘patients whose follow -up ends prior to 
day 42 ’ from patient replacement criteria  
section 11.4 – update stopping rule calculations  
6 04/28/2015  Through- out protocol:  change ALT -803 administration route 
from IV to SQ  while retaining other aspects of the study design 
(dose escalation plan, treatment schedule, accrual and 
endpoints ). Begin SQ enrollment at the current IV dose level 3 
to ensure safety  
Synopsis/Schema, sections 6.2, 7 and 9:  Allow up to 3 
treatment cycles of ALT -803 (4 weekly treatments followed by 
a minimum of 2 weeks rest) in patients with stable disease 
and no unacceptable toxicity  
Schema, sections 4.24 and 7.1: Permit patients who received 
IV treatment to re- enroll as a “new” enrollment in the SQ 
cohort and allow to receive up to 3 additional cycles of ALT -
803 
Synopsis/Schema, section 7:  shorten follow -up time from 5 
years to 2 years  
Schema, sections 6.2.1.1, and 11:  DLT and early stopping rule

April 12 , 2016  Page 9 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  Synopsis  
Study 
Design:  This is a multi -center, phase I/II clinical trial for patients who have relapse d more than 60 
days after allogeneic transplant  for a hematologic malignancy.  The study consists of two 
phases.  The dose finding phase is a modified version of a phase I trial  and the extended 
phase is a modified version of a phase II trial.  
 
The primary objective of the dose finding phase is to determine the maximum tolerated, 
minimum efficacious dose (MTD/MED) of a interleukin- 15 (IL-15) super  agonist complex  
(ALT-803) w hen given once weekly  for 4 weeks .  Effective with the April 2015 revision, 
patient may receive up to 3 treatment cycles.  The study will follow a standard 3+3 design of dose escalation for toxicity with an added feature of stopping early if biologic activ ity is 
detected using absolute lymphocyte count as a surrogate marker . Up to six  dose levels of 
ALT-803  will be tested to determine the MTD/MED .   
 The primary goal of the extended phase is to study the potential efficacy of ALT -803 in 
this patient population.   Efficacy will be measured using rates of remission induction.  An 
optimal Simon’s two- stage design will be used in this phase.  Stage 1 will enroll 14 
patients , including the 6 patients treated at the MTD/MED during the dose finding phase.  
If 3 or more of these 14 patients respond to ALT -803, the trial will move to stage 2 and 
enroll an additional 23 patients.  
 The hypothesis is that ALT-803 will enhance allogeneic immunity through NK cells and 
CD8+ T cells capable of mediating a response without the need for lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy.   A secondary aim is to achieve this goal without being limited by severe 
GVHD  side effects . 
 
Follow -up for overall response, toxicity, and survival through 1 year from the 1
st dose of 
ALT-803. 
 
Primary 
Objective:  Dose finding phase:   To determine the maximum tolerated, minimum efficacious dose 
(MTD /MED)  of ALT-803 when given weekly  for 4 doses  in patients with a hematologic 
malignancy who have relapsed after allogeneic transplant  
 
Extended Phase:   To study the potential efficacy of ALT -803 in this patient population as 
measured by the rates of remission induction  
 
Secondary 
Objectives:  • To evaluate the safety of the ALT-803 when administered on this schedule  
• To determine the incidence of acute GVH D within 6 weeks after the 1st  dose of ALT -803 
 
Correlative 
Objectives: • To monitor the number and function of NK cells, T cells, and T regulatory cells pre - 
and post -therapy  
• To quantify  serum levels of ALT -803 and ALT -803 antibodies  
 
Eligible 
Diseases:  • Relapse ≥ 60 days post allogeneic stem cell transplantation for one of the following 
hematologic malignancies:  
o Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)  
o Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)  
o Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)  
o Lymphoma 
o Myeloma  
o Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)  
o Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) – failed or refused TKI and DLI

April 12 , 2016  Page 10 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023   
 
  Inclusion 
Criteria:  • Minimum of 10% donor cell chimerism  
• Age ≥ 18 years of age, Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70%  
• Adequate renal, hepatic, and cardiac function  
• Off prednisone and other systemic immunosuppressants for at least 14 days prior to 
1st dose of study drug  
• No indicators of acute or chronic GVDH requiring systemic treatment  
• Prior DLI permitted but must be at least 30 days between DLI and 1st dose of ALT -803 
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases  are not eligible  
 
Endpoints:  Dose Finding Phase:  the Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) and/or Minimum Efficacious 
Dose (MED ) for ALT -803 will be identified based on severity of treatment -emergent 
toxicity using CTCAE version 4 and/or biologic activity using a surrogate marker of  
absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)  
 
Extended Phase:  Potential efficacy will be measured by the rates of remission induction 
based on bone marrow examination 1 and 3 months after the last dose of ALT -803 
 
Sample Size:  Dose Finding Phase:   16 patient s were enrolled in the IV dosing cohort testing dose 
levels 1 through 4.  With the change to SQ injection and enrollment re-starting at dose 
level 3 as required;  the minimum additional enrollment during the dose- escalation phase 
will be 6 with a maximum additional 24 patients (6 each at the 4 remaining doses).  
 Extended Phase:  stage 1 – 14 patients (includes the 6 patients treated at the MTD/MED 
during the dose finding phase), if stage 2 is activated an additional 23 patients will be 
required  
 
Enrollment 
 Enrollment to dose level 1 is limited to University of Minnesota patients.  
Affiliate sites may begin enrollment with dose level 2.   
 
Enrollment is expected to take 24-36 months if all study components are completed.

2.0 Background and Significance  
2.1 Introduction 
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation results in an approximately 40-
60% disease- free survival in patients with acute or chronic leukemias and 
myelodysplastic syndromes.  The effectiveness of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation depends in part on ablation of the malignant clone with a preparative regimen and reinfusion of benign stem cells to restore normal 
hematopoiesis.  However, it is well established that the success of allogeneic transplantation is in part mediated by a graft -versus -leukemia 
effect induced by donor -derived T lymphocytes or NK cells.  This graft -
versus -leukemia effect is usually associated with acute and/or chronic 
graft-versus -host disease which are also mediated by donor -derived 
lymphocytes.  In patients with leukemia and multiple myeloma there is a 
statistically significant correlat ion between the occurrence of acute graft -
versus -host disease and freedom from relapse (1- 4). 
2.2 Relapse After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation  
The effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation for diseases such as CML, AML, MDS and ALL depends on the disease and the disease stage at the time of transplant.  Relapse rates in patients undergoing transplantation with unmodified allogeneic donor grafts vary and are

April 12 , 2016  Page 14 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  approximately 15% for good risk patients  and fully ablative preparative 
regimens  and up to 50% f or advanced leukemias  and reduced intensity 
preparative regimens.  Relapse rates are higher in those patients who 
receive lymphocyte depleted grafts, especially for CML where relapse rates are as high as 70% at 3 years (1- 3).  CLL numbers are small and 
often are not separated out from other miscellaneous lymphoid 
malignancies in the literature, however there definite long -term survivors 
after allogeneic transplant.  If a patient relapsed after hematopoietic cell 
transplantation, prior to lymphocyte infusions, very few effective therapies were available.  
 
In multiple myeloma, in a study of 17 patients with advanced stage disease, the rate of complete remission increased to 73% after a dose-reduced allograft increase from 18% after cytoreductive autografting.  (5) 
For patients with AML and ALL, a second course of reinduction chemotherapy can be given with variable results.  Between 12% and 70% of patients will achieve a second complete remission.  However, the median survival of patients undergoing additional c hemotherapy for 
relapse post -transplant in acute leukemia varies between 5.5 and 12 
months.  Long -term disease- free survival is very unlikely.

 A second marrow transplant can be performed for AML, ALL, CML, or MDS but with significant mortality.  Several studies demonstrate that continuous complete remission for greater than one year varies between 10 and 50%.  A second bone marrow transplant is associated with v ery 
high early mortality (between 20 and 55%).  IBMTR data evaluating second sibling transplants in 114 patients demonstrate that leukemia- free 
survival was 7% if undergoing transplantation within 6 months of first transplantation and 28% if second transpl antation occurred greater than 6 
months after the first ( 9).  Hospitalizations for second transplants are 
lengthy, complicated and costly.

2.3 Donor Lymphocyte Infusion After Relapse 
Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) can produce long lasting remissions 
after relapse for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), although it has proven less effective in non- CML blood disorders.  As there are few 
treatment options available after  relapse in this patient population, donor 
lymphocyte infusion (DLI) using the same donor as transplant or a close relative as the cell source is the fallback standard of care.  Based on our experience, using a lymphodepleting chemotherapy compared to no lymphodepletion improved complete remission rate and improved 1 and 2 
year survival in those who achieved a CR; however the incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD lead to morbidity (14).  By reducing the DLI cell dose, the 
incidence of severe acute GVHD dropped the incidence of severe GVHD (25% for the lower cell dose vs 66% for the higher cell dose) while the CR rates were similar (45% and 53% respectively) and long term DFS is still limited by subsequent relapse (15).  
2.4 Interleukin -15 (IL -15) 
Interleukin- 15 (IL- 15) is a cytokine and growth factor capable of expanding 
activated T cells and NK cells. By broad consensus, the NCI Immunotherapy Workshop (2007) ranked IL- 15 as the #1 agent with “high 
potential for immunotherapy.”( 16). Based on preclinical non- human 
primate and early phase clinical trial data, IL- 15 regimens can 
unquestionably be designed to prospectively and reproducibly increase T -
cell and NK -cell counts. Increased T -cell and NK -cell counts are likely to 
expand the autochthonous T -cell response present  in some patients with 
melanoma ( 17;18) and to augment the efficacy of other immunotherapy 
modalities. Other immune modalities that might work together with IL- 15 
include T -cell therapy, cancer vaccines, monoclonal antibody treatment, 
therapy with other im mune response modifiers/T -cell growth factors such 
as IL -7, blockers of the programmed death 1 (PD -1)/programmed death 
ligand -1 axis and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen- 4 (CTLA -4), and 
agonistic antibodies to CD40 or OX40 costimulatory molecules.  
 
2.4.1  rhIL- 15 
The NCI Biological Resource Branch has manufactured E. coli -
expressed recombinant human IL- 15 (rhIL- 15), and testing is currently 
underway. Systemic administration of NCI rhIL- 15 by daily intravenous 
(IV) bolus has been shown to increase the number of circulating CD8+ T and NK cells, but the cytokine has a very short half -life. In non-
human primates, NCI rhIL- 15 was most effective when administered by 
continuous IV infusion. To a lesser extent, daily subcutaneous injection

April 12 , 2016  Page 16 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  of NCI rhIL -15 was also effective at expanding the number of 
peripheral blood activated T cells and NK cells. These data strongly 
imply that low -dose continued presence of IL- 15 in serum will be most 
effective at expanding T cells and NK cells.  
2.4.2  rhIL-15 Experience at the University of Minnesota  
To date 10 patients have treated on our investigator initiated, dose escalation, single institution clinical trial of intravenous r hIL-15 given 
daily for 12 days beginning the morning after the administration of 
haploidentical donor NK cells in adults with relapsed or refractory AML. This is after high dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine but in a non-transplant setting.  Initially 5 dose levels were proposed (0.25 mcg/kg to 3 mcg/kg daily for 12 doses); however; after one dose limiting toxicity (DLT - diffuse alveolar hemorrhage leading to respiratory 
compromise) and prolonged neutropenia experienced in 2 out of 4 patients at dose level 3 (1 mcg/kg/day), and after discussion with the FDA, dosing was dropped down to half way between dose level 2 and 3 (0.75 mcg/kg/day).  This decision was based on no DLTs at dose level 2 and NK cell expansion at dose level 3. Enrollment continues at the 0.75 mcg/kg/day dose level with chills, febrile neutropenia and hypertension the most frequent side effects.  
2.5 ALT-803 
This trial will evaluate an alternative IL- 15 construct designed to have a 
prolonged serum half -life. The novel IL- 15 immunoconjugate, ALT -803 
was developed by our collaborator, Altor BioScience Corporation (Altor, Miramar, FL), to overcome some of the biologic, regulatory, and 
commercial limitations of unmodified E. coli -derived rhIL- 15. Under natural 
circumstances, IL -15 and IL- 15 Receptor -alpha (IL- 15R) are coordinately 
expressed by antigen- presenting cells (i.e., monocytes and dendritic cells) 
(19). During signaling by the IL- 15 pathway, IL- 15 bound to IL- 15R is 
presented in trans to neighboring NK or CD8+ T cells expressing only the IL-2R receptor. At the immunologic synapse, IL15 trans -presentation 
appears to be a dominant mechanism for IL- 15 action in vivo, providing 
tight physiologic control over the functions of IL- 15 under homeostatic 
conditions and in response to immune stimuli ( 20). ALT -803 is a novel 
recombinant human superagonist IL- 15 complex (ie, IL- 15N72D:IL-
15RαSu/IgG1 Fc complex) with a  prolonged serum half -life in preclinical 
animal models. In addition, ALT -803 contains a novel IL- 15 mutein with a 
single substituted amino acid (rhIL- 15N72D) that has a 4- fold increase in 
biologic activity greater than wild- type IL- 15 (IL -15 wt) ( 21).  
 Normal soluble IL- 15R fragments, containing the “sushi” domain (Su) at 
the N terminus, have been shown to contain most of the structural elements responsible for cytokine binding, and IL- 15R binds IL- 15 with 
high affinity (Kd 100 pM). In addition, soluble I L-15R and IL- 15 in solution 
 
HM2013-12:   IL-15 Super Agonist ALT-803 to Treat Relapse Of Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic SCT   
 
   
April 12 , 2016  Page 17 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  can form stable heterodimeric complexes capable of modulating (ie, either 
stimulating or blocking) immune responses via the IL- 2R complex (22, 23, 
24)). Previous studies have shown that the biologic activity of IL- 15 could 
be increased 50- fold by administering preformed complexes of IL- 15 and 
soluble IL- 15R, which has a longer half -life than rhIL- 15 (22, 24) . The IL -
15:IL- 15R complex increases activity at lower concentrations, and the 
fusion with Ig -G1 Fc increases serum half -life, providing more ideal 
pharmacokinetics with prolonged cytokine function ( 25).   
 We hypothesize that ALT -803 will likely require only weekly or twice 
weekly injections to achieve a similar benefits  to that provided by low -dose 
continuous rhIL15 exposure.  This will allow a less complex administration 
schedule that should be preferred by patients and clinicians. Data from preclinical studies in mice and non- human primates support this 
hypothesis ( 26). Moreover, ALT -803 will provide a safe and effective 
meth od for increasing activated antigen- specific T cells and NK cells to 
benefit patients with hematologic malignancy who have relapsed after an allogeneic stem cell transplant . 
 ALT-803 has undergone good laboratory practice (GLP) pharmacology 
and toxicity studies in non- human primate models, to complete the 
investigational new drug (IND) requirements for the planned first time in humans testing. The preliminary results from the GLP toxicity study in non-human primates indicate that 4 weekly doses of ALT -803 are well 
tolerated at 0.1 mg/kg  (100 mcg/kg), well above the highest dose level 
proposed in this study .  
2.6 ALT-803 by Subcutaneous Injection (effective with the April 2015 
protocol revision) 
Emerging data from ongoing trials using the NCI’s recombinant human IL-
15 (rhIL- 15) product and preclinical reports from Altor suggest s that 
intravenous dosing likely is not optimal for IL- 15 because it induces a high 
Cmax and secondary cytokine release (IL- 6 and IFNγ) that affects its 
tolerability  therefore limiting .  Alternately, based on  pre-clinical studies , 
other studies using rHIL-15, and published studies with IL-2, 
subcutaneous dosing is safer and provides much better tolerability.  The 
increased tolerance of subcutaneous dosing is likely a result of a 
decreased Cmax compared with the same dose level administered 
intravenously and more sustained levels of the rIL-15 product in 
circulation.   Lowering the Cmax allows  for more drug delivery overall.  
 
Waldmann  and colleagues  conducted the first in human solid tumor trial of 
rhIL-15 using daily intravenous bolus infusion for 12 consecutive days.  
(27)  Dose limiting toxicities observed at the 3.0 and 1.0 mcg/kg per day 
cohort were grade 3 hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and elevations of ALT and AST.  The maximum tolerated dose was declared at 0.3mcg/kg

April 12 , 2016  Page 18 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  per day.  In contrast, the ongoing subcutaneous trial using the same rhIL-
15 product being conducted through the Cancer Immunotherapy Trials 
Network ([Protocol CITN11- 02: A Phase 1 Study of Recombinant IL15 
(rhIL15) in Adults with Advanced Solid Tumors: Melanoma, Renal Cell, Non-Small Cell Lung and Head and Neck Cancer  – Dr. Jeffrey Miller - PI] 
has successfully completed dose cohorts of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mcg/kg of rhIL -15 given as 10 daily doses out of 12 days (no dosing on days 6 
and 7).  The study  is currently enrolling at 3 mcg/kg  with no dose li miting 
toxicity.  The major conclusion from this experience is that going from IV to 
subcutaneous dosing increases safety and allows for an MTD ≥ 6 times 
higher. In addition, research lab correlates show an increase in in vivo  NK 
cell counts with this subcutaneous dose of rhIL- 15 compared to what is 
reported with IV dosing.  
Altor BioScience has also conducted pre- clinical studies to compare the 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antitumor efficacy of ALT -803 
intravenous versus subcutaneous administration in mice.   The results of 
these studies indicated that going to subcutaneous dosing decreases the 
Cmax compared to IV dosing, retains the immunostimulatory and 
antitumor efficacy without exaggerating toxicity.  The main summary of the 
mice data (as no humor data) is that: when comparing IV to SQ, the peak 
conc entration  decreased by nearly 3- fold.  We believe that peak 
concentration correlates with secondary cytokine release, such as IFNy and IL- 6, which may be linked to fevers and low blood pressure, both of 
which are frequent and often treatment limiting side effects in this current clinical trial. 
To date, potential efficacy was seen in two patients  who received IV 
dosing .  One subject had relapsed acute myeloid leukemia ( AML) and had 
a pericardial chloroma (but no BM involvement) that decreased in size two 
months after treatment on CT scan. A second subject had 10% blasts 
associated with thrombocytopenia late after transplant. During treatment, his platelet count increased and  two months later, his marrow blast count 
was still 10%. Although still with disease, stable disease is unusual in AML and untreated progression is usually rapid.   Encouragement is seen with 
these two patients and switching to a SQ route of administration may allow 
more effective dosing with fewer limiting side effects.  
3.0 Study Rationale  
Relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains a clinical challenge. Donor Lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has been documented to induce varying levels of response depending on the underlying hematologic malignancy. CML remains the most clinically re sponsive with lymphoma, AML/MDS, CLL, and ALL showing 
decreasing levels of response and long term disease free survival. These studies establish proofs of concept that allogeneic immune responses can have direct anti-tumor responses but, how often these responses are inadequate.

A study is ongoing with r IL-15 at the University of Minnesota building on an 
ongoing trial at the NIH for melanoma and renal cell; however only a dosing schedule of 12 daily infusions is being tested.  This current schedule requi res 
either inpatient administration or daily visits (including weekends) by the patient imposing greatly on quality of life, as well as resulting in considerable expense in terms of resources and money.   
 ALT-803 is a recombinant human super agonist IL- 15 complex with IL- 15 
presented with IL- 15Rα and with the complex fused with Fc. Due to the higher 
affinity single amino acid substituted IL- 15 and the presentation of IL -15 with IL-
15Rα, ALT -803 is likely to be effective at low concentrations. Due to its longer 
half-life as a result of fusion with Fc, ALT -803 is likely to be effective using a 
practical regimen of weekly or biweekly injections. It is likely that low concentrations of ALT -803 will enhance allogeneic immunity through NK cells 
and CD8+  T cells c apable of mediating a response without  the need for 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy  and with a safety profile appropriate for 
outpatient use.  
 
If the first dose of ALT -803 as an inpatient  is well tolerated, subsequent t reatment 
may be offered in the outpatient clinic setting with the understanding that the 
patient will be admitted to the hospital if medically indicated. Given that relapse after transplant often leads to death, many patients prefer the opportunity of treatment/medical management in a full serv ice outpatient setting over 
hospitalization to maximize quality of life.  Patients who require admission for 
medical reasons will receive treatment in the hospital.  
 To be eligible for this study, the patient must agree to stay within a reasonabl e 
distance (i.e. 30 minutes travel time) of the study center for the duration of the 
first treatment cycle through 24 hours after the last dose .  Patients enrolled in the 
dose escalation component will be required to remain in the area.  Patients enrolled in the extension may have this requirement waived on an individual 
basis at the discretion of  the treating physician.   
 Up to six dose levels of ALT -803 will be tested using a standard 3+3 design of 
dose escalation for toxicity with an added feature of  stopping early if efficacy is 
confirmed  using absolute lymphocyte count as a surrogate biomarker .  The 
starting dose level of ALT -803 will be 1 mcg/kg.  This dose is equivalent to the 
starting dose of a CITN trial under development for metastatic melanoma and   
based on allometric scaling to an equivalent human dose of pre- clinical mouse 
and cynomolgus monkey data ( personal communication with Altor) .    
 In April 2015 the protocol was revised to replace intravenous (IV) administration of ALT -803 with a subcutaneous (SQ) injection  while maintaining the current 
dose escalation/enrollment  plan.  To ensure safety with the SQ  dosing , a 
minimum of 3 patients will be enrolled in the highest dose level tested during

until the MTD/MED is identified or until dose level 6 (30 mcg/kg) is completed.  
The extended phase will be activated to complete study enrollment . 
 In addition  in April 2015 the protocol  was amended to provide additional 
treatment opportunities:    
• With the change to SQ administration, the treatment plan was changed to permit the administration of up to 3 treatment cycles in patients with stable disease  who meet the criteria found in section 6.2.  
• patients who were previously treated with intravenous ALT -803 will be 
eligible to re -enroll in the protocol at the current ALT -803 dose level under 
the subcutaneous treatment plan provided they received at least 3 doses 
of IV ALT -803 without dose limiting toxicity and they meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria per section 4.  (re-enrollment details  deleted in 
the April 2016 version as there were no eligib le patients remaining)  
 In April 2016 the protocol was amended to enroll a total of 6 patients in dose 
level 4 (ALT -803 at 10 mcg/kg) despite no dose limiting toxicity in the 1
st 2 
patients.  As cl inical activity has been observed in the dosing cohorts tested so 
far (at least one complete response and several subjects with stable disease)  in 
the absence of unacceptable toxicity , this dose may prove to be the optimal level 
for the extended phase.  The decision whether to continue dose escalation, or more likely, to declare ALT 803 at 10 mcg/kg the optimal dose for additional 
testing will be made after 6 patients are treated at dose level 4.   If we decide to 
dose escalate further, dosing cohorts 5 and 6 have also been lowered to 
increase safety.  
  
4.0 Patient Selection  
Study entry is open to adults 18 years and older  regardless of gender, race or 
ethnic background.  While there will be every effort to seek out and include females and minority patients, the patient population is expected to be no different than that of allogeneic stem cell transplant studies at the University of Minnesota and other participating institutions.  
 Inclusion Criteria  
4.1 Relapse after previous allogeneic stem cell transplant for one of the following hematologic malignancies - acute myelogenous leukemia , acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia, m yelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) , lymphoma, 
myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia 
meeting the following : 
• For non- CML, relapse will be defined based on disease specific 
morphologic criteria from a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate or recurrence of disease specific cytogenetics.  For disease specific definition of relapse, see appendix III.  Relapse can be determined 
morphologically . Equivocal results for relapse should result in a

5.0 Registration/Dose Assignment Procedures  
Registration will occur afte r the patient  has signed the subject consent and 
eligibility is confirmed, but before any study related procedures are performed.   
 To be eligible for registration to this study, the patient must meet each of the 
criteria listed on the eligibility checklist based on the eligibility assessment documented in the patient’s medical record.   
 A copy of the eligibility checklist is in appendix I and under attachments within 
this study in OnCore. 
5.1 Registration and ALT -803 Dose Level Assignment
 
Upon completion of the screening evaluation, eligibility confirmation and obtaining written  consent, study site coordinator or designee will enroll the 
patient into O nCore.  
 OnCore will automatically generate an email alerting key study personnel of the registration.  The Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) Study Coordinator or designee will assign the ALT -803 dose level in OnCore to complete the

April 12 , 2016  Page 23 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  registration.  An email with the dose level assignment will be sent to 
relevant study personnel.   
 
Affiliate sites only:   At the time of registration, a copy of the signed consent 
and completed eligibility checklist will be uploaded as an attachment into 
OnCore under the patient’s record .  Affiliates are responsible for fulfilling 
any local patient registration requirements.  
5.2 Patients Who Are Registered and Do Not Receive Study Treatment  
If a patient is registered to the study and is later found not able to begin  
ALT-803, for whatever reason, the patient will be removed from study and 
treated at the physician’s discretion.  Study staff  will update O nCore of the 
patient’s non- treatment status.  Study data will be collected until the time 
the patient is  taken  off study.  Th e reason for removal from study will be 
clearly indicated in O nCore.  The patient  will be considered unevaluable 
and replaced  per section 11.3 . 
 
 6 Treatment Plan  
In order to provide optimal patient care and to account for individual medical 
conditions, investigator discretion may be used in the prescribing of all supportive 
care drug therapy (i.e. acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, antimicrobials, etc.) ; 
however the use of systemic steroid medications may result in loss of therapeutic effects of the study d rug and should be avoided.  Topical steroid cream is 
permitted.   
6.1 At the Time of Relapse 
At the time of relapse, patients should be tapered off immunosuppressive medications as soon as possible.  To be eligible for this study, patients 
must be off prednisone and other immunosuppressive agents for at least 14 days before the first dose of ALT -803. 
6.2 ALT-803 Administration 
ALT-803 will be administered subcutaneously at the assigned dose level 
once a week (on day 1, 8, 15 and 22) .  Injection sites should be rota ted 
per institutional guidelines and each injection site separated by at least 1 inch.  
 The first dose of ALT -803 of the 1
st cycle will be given as an inpatient; 
however  if the first dose is well tolerated, subsequent doses may be 
administered in an outpatient setting.  
 A window of +/ - 2 day s for the weekly ALT -803 dosing is allowed in the 
event of scheduling issues (i.e. holiday).  All other tests and evaluations 
associated with that week’s dose will be adjusted accordingly.

April 12 , 2016  Page 24 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  Recommended Skin Rash Management Plan (begins day before ALT-
803 dose) : 
With the April 2016 protocol revision a skin rash management plan was 
added.  S ince the change to subcutaneous administration, an increase in 
the frequency and severity of skin rash has been noted.     
  
The following is recommended for  all patients with every dose of ALT -803.  
Adjustment s to the plan are permitted without being a deviation.  Refer to 
section 6.3.2 for management of skin rash despite these preventive 
measures.    
 
• One day prior to each ALT -803 dose:   Diphenhydramine 25- 50 mg 
TID orally  
• One hour prior to each ALT -803 dose:  Diphenhydramine 25- 50 mg  
orally with one of the following:  
Ranitidine 300 mg orally  
Cimetidine 300 mg orally  
Famotidine 20 mg orally  
• After each ALT -803 dose:  Continue Diphenhydramine 25- 50 mg 
TID orally x 2 days  
 
Pre-medication:  Acetaminophen 650 mg PO and diphenhydramine 25 
mg PO/IV thirty minutes before and 4 hours after each dose of ALT -803 is 
recommended.   (adjust as needed if using skin rash prophylaxis)  
 Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory medication including  acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, or naproxen may be given per physician discretion following the 
recommended dosing thresholds : 
Acetaminophen: not to exceed 3000 mg (3 grams) in 24 hours  
Ibuprofen: not to exceed 2400 mg in 24 hours  
Naproxen: not  to exceed 1100 mg in 24 hours  
 The use of systemic steroid medications may result in loss of therapeutic effects of the study drug and should be avoided; however in the event of a 
life-threatening  inflammatory reaction to ALT-803, the IV administration of 
dexamethasone or other steroid- based medication is warranted.   
 Monitoring:
   
During the Dose Finding Phase:   Patients will be observed for a minimum 
of 6 hours  after each dose of ALT-803 for immediate adverse events .  
 
During the Extended Phase:   Patients will be observed for a minimum of 6 
hours after dose 1 of cycle 1 and a minimum of 2 hours after subsequent 
doses are the care team ’s discretion .   
 
 
HM2013-12:   IL-15 Super Agonist ALT-803 to Treat Relapse Of Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic SCT   
 
   
April 12 , 2016  Page 25 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, temperature, and 
oxygen saturation) for all patients will be documented prior to each ALT-
803 dose and then at 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes  then hourly until 
discharge from clinic (minimum of 6 hours for Dose Finding Phase, 
minimum of 2 hours for Extended Phase).    
 
For inpatients:   continue vitals hourly (+/ - 15 minutes)  until 6 hours post 
dosing, then every 3 hours , or more often if indicated, beyond the first 6 
hours  until 24 hours post dosing.  
 
For outpatients:   Admission to the inpatient unit (or continue d outpatient 
monitoring) should be considered i f any of the following occurs and is still 
present at the end of required observation period :  
• a new fever > 102.3°F (39.0°C) develops or  
• an oxygen saturation drops below 90% or  
• there is a sustained changes in baseline vital signs by 20% for more than 1 hour or  
• if there is any change in symptoms of concern 
 If vital signs remain within baseline and none of the  changes above are 
present at the end of the observation period, the patient is eligible for continued outpatient monitoring : 
 Upon discharge from the outpatient infusion area on the day of each 
injection , it will be  reitera ted the need to contact the study staff or BMT 
physician on call with any questions or concerns.  The patient will be given 
emergency access phone numbers and access to immediate hospital admission should be a clinical status change.  
 
 
During week 1 of the first cycle , the patient will be discharged from the 
hospital after the 24 hour post  injection assessment and lab work is done 
with a return to clinic at approximately 48, 72, and 96 hours post injection 
for a brief assessment and lab work , if scheduled.  
 
During weeks 2, 3, and 4 of the first cycle and all doses of subsequent 
cycles, the patient will return to clinic approximately 24 hours post injection 
for a brief assessment and lab work.   If ALT -803 is administered in the 
inpatient setting, the 24 hour post injection assessment and lab work will 
be done prior to discharge.  
 Refer to  section 3 regarding requirements for staying close to the study 
site during the 1
st treatment cycle.  
 Targeted toxicities (appendix VI) and unexpected adverse events will be collected at the time points listed in section 9.2.

April 12 , 2016  Page 26 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023   
Dose modification:  No dose modifications are allowed.  If a patient 
experiences toxicity that meets the definition used for dose limiting toxicity 
(DLT) at any time, ALT -803 will be permanently discontinued.  
 Dose delay:  ALT-803 administration may be delayed by 1 week if on the 
day of the planned injection for any of the following situations : 
• Grade 2 or greater acute GVHD is questioned (documented grade 3-4 GVHD will require discontinuing ALT -803) 
• the patient has a fever of > 101°F (38.3 °C)  
• treatment related side effects (except skin rash) have not resolved to grade 1 or better  
• if in the opinion of the treating physician, a 1 week delay would be of benefit to the patient   
 If after a 1 week  rest, the patient no longer meets any of the above criteria 
for dose delay, the patient may resume treatment  with the intent of giving 
all 4 doses  of ALT -803.   
 If after 1 week, the patient is still unable to be treated, the patient will be taken off treatment and followed per section 6. 7. 
 Up to two separate 1 week delays will be permitted within a cycle 
potentially extending the treatment cycle to  a maximum of 6 weeks .   
 If a delay is required in association with more than 2 of the injections  
within a treatment cycle, the patie nt will be taken off treatment and 
followed per section 6. 7. 
  Patients who do not receive at least 3 out of 4 doses for reasons other than toxicity  will be unevaluable and will be replaced in that dose level 
cohort per section 11. 3. 
 Additional treatment cycles:  A disease re- assessment will be done 
approximately 2 weeks after the 4
th dose of ALT -803.  Patients with stable 
disease may be considered for an additional treatment cycle ( up to 2 
additional cycles ) at the same dose of ALT -803 if all of the following 
criteria are met:  
• received all 4 doses in previous cycle (exceptions may be made on an 
individual patient basis if no more than one dose was missed for 
reasons other than toxicity)  
• patient had no unacceptable toxicity during previ ous cycle ( i.e. did not 
experience the equivalence of dose limiting toxicity)  
• treatment related side effects (except skin rash) have resolved to grade 1 or better  
• no evidence of > grade 1 GVHD

April 12 , 2016  Page 27 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023   
Day 1 of each subsequent treatment cycle must be at least 2 weeks , but 
not more than 4 weeks after the last dose of the previous cycle.    
 
6.2.1  ALT-803 Dose Level Assignment – Dose Finding Phase  
ALT-803 dose level assignment will occur at the time of study 
registration based on the following Dose Level cohorts:  
Dose Level  ALT-803  
Weekly  
Dose  Route of 
Administration  Number of 
Patients  Enrolling 
Institutions  
1 1 microgram/kg  IV 6* U of MN  
2 3 microgram/kg  IV 3 to 6   
U of MN and 
affiliates  3 6 microgram/kg  IV 3 to 6  
3a# 6 microgram/kg  SQ  
4 10 microgram/kg  SQ 6& 
5 15 microgram/kg  SQ 3 to 6  
6 20 microgram/kg  SQ 3 to 6  
* with the Feb 10, 2014 dose level 1 was expanded to 6 patients total  after which dose escalation 
will continue as planned  
# with the April 28, 2015 protocol version ALT -803 dosing was changed from IV to SQ and dose 
level 3 (6 mcg/kg)  was repeated to confirm safety with the new route of administration – in the 
unlikely event of dose de- escalation to level 2 or 1, the route of  administration will be SQ  
&with the April 2016 protocol version Dose Level 4 (10 mcg/kg) was expanded to enroll 6 patients 
despite the absence of DLT to gain further toxicity data before making the decision to continue 
dose escalation or declare level 4 the optimal dose and proceed to the extended phase. Dosing 
cohorts 5 and 6 were lowered to increase safety.  
 
Within a dose level, the 1st patient must receive a minimum of 2 
doses before additional patients are enrolled.  The 1st dose for 
subsequent patients within a dose level must be separated by  at 
least 72 hours .  Dose escalation to the next level cannot proceed 
until the following conditions are met:  
• All patients at the current dose level have complete d at least 3 
of the 4 planned ALT-803 doses  
• The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been exceeded   
• The minimum efficacious dose (MED) of ALT-803 dose has not 
been reached  
 In February  2014 dose level 1 was expanded to enroll 6 patients 
total.  This was done to confirm the findings in the 1
st 3 patients  of 
possible immune activation (evidenced by a fever between 2 to 3 hours after each dose) and to gain additional experience before continuing the dose escalation plan described in section 11.1.   
 
In April 2015, the protocol was revised to replace intravenous (IV) administration of ALT -803 with a subcutaneous (SQ) injection while 
maintaining the current dose escalation/enrollment plan.  To ensure 
 
HM2013-12:   IL-15 Super Agonist ALT-803 to Treat Relapse Of Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic SCT   
 
   
April 12 , 2016  Page 28 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  safety with the SQ dosing, a minimum of 3 patients will be enrolled 
in the highest dose level tested during intravenous administration (dose level 3 - 6 mcg/kg).   
 In April 2016, dose level 4 (10 mcg/kg) was expanded to enroll 6 patients despite no dose limiting toxicity and dose levels 5 and 6 were reduced to 15 mcg/kg and 20 mcg/kg.  
 Intra-patient dose escalation is not allowed.  
  6.2.1.1  Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
Toxicity and adverse events will be classified according to NCI ’s 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE).  
 Dose limiting toxicity (DLT ) is defined as  (during  first treatment 
cycle only) : 
• any grade 3 treatment -emergent , non -hematologic  toxicity 
lasting more than 48 hours  with exception to the following 
events which will not count toward DLT : 
o Grade 3 fatigue and/or anorexia  
o Grade 3 hypertension  
o Grade 3 fever without evidence of infection  
o Grade 3 diarrhea despite the use of adequate/maximal 
medical intervention and/or prophylaxis  
o Grade 3 skin rash not requiring  systemic steroid therapy  
• any grade 4 or 5 treatment -emergent, non- hematologic  toxicity   
• grade III or IV acute GVHD within 6 weeks of the 1st dose of 
ALT-803 
 Dose escalation will be done based on the schema found in section 11.  DLT’s will be counted based on the number of patients with 
DLT at a given dose level, not the absolute number of DLTs.  No single patient can trigger more than one DLT event.  No further 
treatment will be given to a patient experiencing a DLT.  
 6.2.1.2  Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
The maximum tolerated dose is that level where no more than 1 out of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity  during the first 
treatment cycle.  6.2.1.3  Definition of Minimal Efficacious Dose (MED)  
Since the ultimate goal is to use ALT -803 as a component of a 
more complex therapy, it will be critical to “leave room” for additional agents by keeping toxicity to a minimum.  With that respect and although the exact threshold for MED is unknown, 
 
HM2013-12:   IL-15 Super Agonist ALT-803 to Treat Relapse Of Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic SCT   
 
   
April 12 , 2016  Page 29 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  given the action of IL- 15 to stimulate homeostatic expansion CD8+ 
T cells and NK cells, we will use the absolute lymphocyte count 
(readily available on a clinical CBC)  as a surrogate biomarker of 
biologic activity  to define the MED.    
 MED  is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of > 25 ,000 
cells/μl that is sustained for > 24 hours i n ≥ 2 of 3 patients (or ≥ 4 of 
6) within a cohort .   
 
6.2.2  ALT-803 Dose Level Assignment – Extended Phase  
All patients will be treated at the ALT -803 MTD/MED declared 
during the Dose Finding Phase while adhering to the study early 
stopping rules  per section 11.4.  
6.3 Management of Selected, Expected Adverse Events 
6.3.1  Hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90  mm Hg)  
For hypotension with systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, AND greater than 20 mm Hg below baseline, AND clinically significant per investigator, ALT -803 should be held until the 
systolic blood pressure reading rises above 90 mm Hg OR to baseline OR is no longer clinically significant.   
 Since the regimen is intended for outpatient administration, the need for fluid support  will be considered on a patient -by-patient 
basis and not count  toward dose limiting toxicity  (if phase I, cycle 
1). 
 However, if urgent medical intervention, such as IV hydration in the emergency room or hospital admission for drug toxicities, is indicated, tALT-803 will be permanently stopped.  If the patient is 
enrolled in the Dose Finding Phase and the event occurs during cycle 1, a DLT  will be reported.  
 
6.3.2  Skin Rash  
Due to the increase in frequency and severity of skin ra sh with 
subcutaneous injection a proactive skin rash management  plan was 
added to section 6.2 in April 2016.   
 If the skin rash area surrounding the ALT -803 injection site is > 6 
cm, it should be treated with topical 0.05% clobetasol prop ionate 
(i.e. 0.05% Cormax) or 0.1% triamcinolone (i.e., Kenalog) cream.  
 A biopsy of skin rash should be considered to confirm or rule- out 
graft versus host disease (GVHD).  
If systemic steroids are required, ALT -803 should be discontinued 
per section 6.5.  If the patient is enrolled in the Dose Finding Phase 
 
HM2013-12:   IL-15 Super Agonist ALT-803 to Treat Relapse Of Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic SCT   
 
   
April 12 , 2016  Page 30 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  and the rash occurs in association with the 1st cycle, a DLT must be 
reported.  
 
6.3.3  Pulmonary Changes  
Pulmonary function will be monitored at each visit by clinical 
examination, assessment of vital signs and pulse oximetry.  Patients with dyspnea or clinical signs of respiratory impairment (tachypnea or rales)  must be further assessed if clinically indicated, 
including the need for hospitalization.  
 6.3.4  Cardiac Changes  
Cardiac function should be monitored at each visit by clinical examination and assessment of vital signs.  In addition, an EKG 
and troponin level will be done at study entry and, for patients enrolled in the Dose Finding Phase only before the 1
st dose and at 
6 and 24 hours post.  Patients with signs or symptoms of chest pain, murmurs, gallops, irregular rhythm, or palpitations must be further assessed if clinically indicated, including the need for 
hospitalization.  If there is evidence of cardiac ischemia or congestive heart failure, ALT -803 will be permanently discontinued.  
6.4 Supportive Care  
Supportive care will be provided per institutional guidelines.  Guidelines may be updated based on current data/drugs without requiring a protocol amendment or be considered a protocol deviation.  
 Due to the similarity of this agent to IL- 2, which can inhibit neutrophil 
chemotaxis and increase the risk of complications from bacterial infections, patients who require or who have a pre- existing venous access 
device will receive prophylactic antibiotic s (i.e. levofloxacin  250 mg daily or 
other appropriate prophylaxis) for the duration of the study treatment.  
 Patients with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma may receive additional therapy (e.g. lenalidomide, bortezomib) at the discretion of the treating physician after a minimum of 14 days have passed from the last dose of 
ALT-803. 
6.5 General Concomitant Medications  Guidelines  
Concurrent chemotherapies (except hydroxyurea) and interferon- alfa 
treatment with ALT -803 are prohibited.   Hydroxyurea may be used to 
control blasts count.  
 Administration of glucocorticoids is prohibited during the ALT -803 
treatment period as the use of systemic steroid medications may result in loss of therapeutic effects of the study drug.  They should be avoided except in the event of a severe toxicity or unrelated condition requiring 
 
HM2013-12:   IL-15 Super Agonist ALT-803 to Treat Relapse Of Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic SCT   
 
   
April 12 , 2016  Page 31 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  steroid and there use will be an indication to stop ALT -803.  Topical 
steroid cream is permitted.   
 
Beta-blockers and other antihypertensives may potentiate the hypotension 
and extra caution should be used during ALT -803 regimen treatment 
period.   It is recognized, that ALT -803 treatment, like IL -2 and IL- 15, may 
be associated with low blood pressure especially if the patient is not well hydrated.   
 Due to the similarity to IL -2 the potential drug interactions  associated with 
IL-2 listed below may occur with ALT -803 treatment:  
• Central nervous function:  interactions could occur with concomitant 
administration of psychotropic drugs (e.g., narcotics, analgesics, antiemetics, sedatives, tranquilizers).  
• Kidney and liver function: concomitant nephrotoxic (e.g., 
aminoglycosides, indomethacin), myelotoxic (e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy), cardiotoxic (e.g., doxorubicin), or hepatotoxic (e.g., methotrexate, asparaginase) medications should be avoided during ALT-803 regimen treatment period.  
• Hypersensitivity reactions:  reported in some patients receiving 
combination regimens of sequential high dose Proleukin and antineoplastic agents, specifically, dacarbazine, cisplatin, tamoxifen and interferon -alfa. Reactions including erythema, pruritus, and 
hypotension occurred within hours of administration of chemotherapy.  
• Autoimmune and inflammatory disorders:  exacerbation or initial 
presentation of crescentic IgA glomerulonephritis, oculo- bulbar 
myasth enia gravis, inflammatory arthritis, thyroiditis, bullous 
pemphigoid, and Stevens -Johnson syndrome has been observed 
following concurrent use of interferon- alfa and Proleukin.  
• Delayed Adverse Reactions to Iodinated Contrast Media:  11–28% of 
patients treate d with various Proleukin containing regimens and 
subsequently administered radiographic iodinated contrast media experienced acute, atypical adverse reactions. The onset of symptoms usually occurred within 1 to 4 hours following the administration of contrast media. Most events occurred when contrast media was given within 4 weeks after the last dose of Proleukin, but reactions were also reported when contrast media was given several months after Proleukin treatment. Reactions included fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, rash, diarrhea, hypotension, edema, and oliguria. Similar conditions may occur with ALT -803 treatment.  
6.6 Duration of Treatment  
Patients may receive up to 3 treatment cycles (4 weekly injections of ALT -
803 followed by at least 2 weeks, but not more than 4 weeks of no 
treatment) unless one or more of the following occurs:  
• consent  is withdrawn or patient is noncompliant

• patient experiences dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or other 
unacceptable toxicity  
• patient requires more than a 1 week delay in the administration of 
an ALT -803 dose  
• patient requires more than two separate 1 week delays from the planned ALT -803 administration day  
• patient requires GVHD therapy  
6.7 Duration of Study  Participation  
Evaluable patients will be followed for overall remission response, toxicity, and survival for 12 months  from the 1
st injection unless one of the 
following occurs:  
• consent is withdrawn  
• the patient is unevaluable per section 11.3 – if a patient is not 
evaluable, he/she will be followed only until the resolution or stabilization of treatment related toxicity.  Unevaluable patients will be replaced to complete enrollment.  
• the patient has no benefit from ALT -803 and/or begins other 
treatment in attempt to control the disease  
• the patient enters hospice care – is this case date and cause of 
death will be recorded upon knowledge  
• data collection on the study ends  
 All patients, regardless of circumstances, must be followed for a minimum of 4 weeks after the last dose of ALT -803 for incidence of acute GVHD 
(DLT event/early study stopping rule event and study endpoint) and any ongoing ALT -803 treatment related toxicit y.  If a clinic visit is not 
reasonable, follow -up may be done by an alternate means including via 
communication with the patient, family and/or local medical provider.

antibodies will be conducted in the laboratory at Altor Bioscience, Miramar, FL.    
  
8 ALT-803 Formulation, Supply, and Potential Toxicity  
 
ALT-803, a recombinant human superagonist IL- 15 complex, is the working 
name of the drug under investigation. Its active ingredient is ALT -803 and its 
pharmacologic class is as a targeted anticancer immunotherapeutic.  
 ALT-803 has been referred to as IL- 15N72D:IL- 15RαSu/IgG1 Fc complex in 
various preclinical study reports, publications, and other related documents. No other names exist for this product, as it is a novel investigational biologic.  
8.1 Formulation and Composition 
The biological drug product, ALT -803, is formulated in a phosphate 
buffered saline solution. The drug substance is produced by a recombinant mammalian cell line and is manufactured without the use of animal derived components. The vialed quantitative composition of ALT -
803 is listed in the table below.  
  
Quantitative Composition of ALT -803 
Component  Concentration  Amount/Vial  
ALT-803 1 mg/mL  1.2 mg  
Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS)  QS 1.2 mL  
PBS Formulation: Sodium Chloride (USP) 8.18 g/L; Sodium Phosphate Dibasic (USP) 2.68 g/L; Potassium 
Phosphate Monobasic (NF) 1.36 g/L pH 7.4.  
HM2013-12:  IL-15 Super Agonist ALT-803 to Treat Relapse Of Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic SCT  
 
 
   
April 12 , 2016  Page 38 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  8.2 Structural Formula   
ALT-803 is a soluble complex consisting of 2 protein subunits of a human 
IL-15 variant associated with high affinity to a dimeric IL- 15R sushi  
domain/human IgG1 Fc fusion protein. The IL -15 variant is a 114 aa 
polypeptide comprising the mature human IL- 15 cytokine sequence with 
an Asn to Asp substitution at position 72 of helix C (N72D).6. The human 
IL-15R sushi domain/human IgG1 Fc fusion protein comprises the sushi 
domain of the IL- 15R subunit (aa 1- 65 of the mature human IL- 15Rα 
protein) linked with the human IgG1 CH2- CH3 region containing the Fc 
domain (232 amino acids). Aside from the N72D substitution, all of the protein sequences are human. Based on the amino acid sequence of the subunits, calculated molecular weight of the complex comprising 2 IL-15N72D polypeptides and a disulfide linked homodimeric IL- 15RαSu/IgG1 
Fc protein is 92.4 kDa. Each IL- 15N72D polypeptide has a calculated 
molecul ar weight of approximately 12.8 kDa and the IL- 15RαSu/IgG1 Fc 
fusion protein has a calculated molecular weight of approximately 33.4 kDa. Both the IL- 15N72D and IL- 15RαSu/IgG1 Fc proteins are 
glycosylated resulting in an apparent molecular weight of ALT -803 as 
approximately 114 kDa by size exclusion chromatography.   The isoelectric 
point (pI) determined for ALT -803 range from approximately 5.6 to 6.5. 
Thus, the fusion protein is negatively charged at pH 7. The calculated molar extinction coefficient at A280 for ALT -803 is 116,540 M -1, or 1.26 
OD280 for a 1 mg/mL solution of ALT -801, or one OD280 is equivalent to 
0.79 mg/mL solution of ALT -803. 
8.3 Storage and Handling 
Study medication is provided in a 2 mL vial containing 1.2 mL of ALT -803 
at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Vials are packaged in cartons and shipped to the cli nical site. Study medication must be maintained at a temperature 
between 2°C and 8°C.  
8.4 Stability  
Stability studies are ongoing and will be continued throughout the clinical study. Based on previous lots, the study drug is expected to be stable for at least 2 years.  The site will be periodically updated on the stability of the drug and will be immediately informed if there is evidence that the drug no longer meets its stability specifications.   
8.5 Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability  
ALT-803 is produced in the USA by Altor Biosciences Corporation, 
Miramar, FL. After manufacturing, the product is stored at Altor Biosciences Corporation for clinical supply, packaging, and labeling. The label indicates the product name, strength, manufacturing date, and the study requirement information. ALT -803 will be shipped from Altor 
Biosciences Corporation to each participating site. (See the Study Procedures Manual for instructions on how to order ALT -803.)

April 12 , 2016  Page 39 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  8.6 Study Drug Preparation and Administration  
ALT-803 dose calculation will be based on actual body weight.  The 
calculated amount of ALT -803 will be drawn into a syringe for 
subcutaneous injection.  The stock concentration is 1 mg/ml.  Doses will 
be drawn directly into the syringe  for injection.   If the  total subcutaneous 
dose is great er than 1.5 mL, the dose will be divided into 2-3 
subcutaneous injections as needed.   Each injection site should be 
separated by at least 1 inch.  
8.7 Agent Inventory Records  
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator 
(e.g. institutional investigational pharmacy), must maintain a record of the inventory and disposition of all agents received from Altor Biosciences Corporation using the Study Agent Drug Accountability Record. (See the Study Procedures Manual for the form to use and instructions on how to complete it. )
 
8.8 Toxicity  
There is no previous safety and effectiveness experience of ALT -803 in 
humans.   The ALT -803 protein complex comprises a variant of iL- 15, a 
common γ chain cytokine that may have similar immunostimulatory properties as IL- 2.   
 The study drug ALT -803 can cause many side effects which may be 
similar to the side effects of interleukin- 2 (IL-2), which has been used for 
more than 20 years.

To prevent or reduce the severity of the anticipated fever and chills, all patients will receive medications before and after each dose of ALT -803. 
 The most common side effects seen on this study with subcutaneous (under the skin) injections have been change in blood pressure (increase or decrease), a reaction at the injection site, and skin rash, which at times has been widespread.   These localized skins reactions are expected to be 
common (up to 20% [one in 5 patients]).  A biopsy of skin rash should be 
considered to confirm or rule- out graft versus host disease (GVHD).   
Refer to the ALT -803 Investigator Brochure for additional detail s. 
 
9 Adverse Event Documentation and Reporting 
 Toxicity and adverse events will be classified according to NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE) and reported on the 
schedule below. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40 
 Note:  throughout this section the generic term “ study drug” refers  to ALT-803. 
9.1 Definitions  
The following definitions are based on the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 312.32 ( 21CFR 312.32(a)).  
  Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 Suspected Adverse Reaction:  Any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  
 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event:  Any event not present prior to the 
initiation of the treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the treatment.   A

April 12 , 2016  Page 41 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  treatment emergent AE refers to an event temporally related to the study 
treatment  regardless of  the causality assessment by the investigator.  
 
Life-Threatening Adverse Event Or Life-Threatening Suspected 
Adverse Reaction : An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  
   
Serious Adverse Event Or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction :  An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defi nition.   
 Event Attribution Categories:  
CTCAE do es not define an AE as necessarily ‘caused by a therapeutic 
intervention.’ The clinical investigator must assign attribution for an 
adverse event after naming and grading of the event.  
 
Attribution with 
2 Options  Attribution 
with 5 Options  Description  
Not related  Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention  
Related  Possible  The AE may be related to the intervention  
Probable  The AE is likely related to the intervention  
Definite  The AE is clearly related to the intervention   
 Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse 
reaction : An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.   Thus, as defined by the FDA

April 12 , 2016  Page 42 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  adverse events that occur as part of the disease process or underlying 
medical con ditions are considered unexpected; however, for the purposes 
of this study they will not be documented or reported. 
9.2 Adverse Event Monitoring and Documentation 
9.2.1  Monitoring Period 
Patients will be monitored for toxicity beginning with the 1st dose of ALT -
803 through the final treatment visit approximately 4 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug.   After the final treatment visit, only those events t hat 
meet the definition of serious , are felt to be at least possibly related to 
ALT-803,and are unexpected will be documented  upon knowledge and, if 
applicable,  reported in an expedited manner .  Affiliate  sites follow section 
9.3 for expedited reporting requirements.  
9.2.2  Event Documentation 
As this study enrolls a medically complicated patient population  adverse 
event documentation will be limited to ALT-803 “targeted” toxicities (side 
effects expected with this treatment  to document the frequency and 
severity ) and unexpected suspected adverse events  (reactions) .   
 Targeted adverse events and unexpected suspected adverse reactions 
will be documented using the form in appendix V  at the following time 
points:

11 Statistical Considerations  
This phase I/II clinical trial includes two phases. The dose finding phase is a modified version of a phase I trial and the extended phase is a modified version of phase II trial.  
11.1 Dose Finding Phase  
The primary objective  of this phase  is to define the “maximum tolerated, 
minimum efficacious dose” ( MTD/MED) of interleukin- 15 (IL- 15) super 
agonist complex (ALT -803) when given once weekly for 4 weeks  in 
patients with hematologic malignancy who have relapsed after allogeneic transplant. The study will follow a standard 3+3 design of dose escalation for toxicity with an added feature of stopping early if efficacy is confirmed. The reason for using this modified 3+3 design is because it is possible for the MED to be below the MTD. Although the exact threshold for MED is unknown, given the action of IL- 15 to stimulate homeostatic expansion

April 12 , 2016  Page 48 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  CD8+ T cells and NK cells, we will use the absolute lymphocyte count 
(readily available on a clinical CBC)  as a surrogate biomarker of biologic 
activity  to define the MED. We would like to identify MTD or MED 
whichever  is encountered first at the dose finding phase and start the 
extended stage with the identified MTD or MED.  
 There are six dose levels of ALT -803 to determine the MTD/MED: 1, 3, 6, 
10, 20, and 30 mcg/kg  (in April 2016, the two highest dose levels were 
reduced to 15 and 20 mcg/kg as it was questioned if doubling the dose 
with each dose level change was excessive) .  Within a dose level, the 1st 
patient must receive a minimum of 2 doses before additional patients are enrolled.  The 1
st dose for subsequent patients within a dose level must be 
separated by at least 72 hours.  Dose escalation to the next level cannot proceed until the following conditions are met:  
• All patients at the current dose level have complete d at least 3 of the 4 
planned ALT-803 doses  
• The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been exceeded   
• The minimum efficacious dose (MED) of ALT-803 dose has not been 
reached  
 
Intra-patient dose escalation is not allowed.  
 Dose limiting toxicity (DLT)  is generally defined as   
• any treatment -emergent  non-hematologic grade 3 toxicity lasting 
more than 48 hours with the exceptions detailed in section 6.2.1.1  
• any treatment -emergent non- hematologic grade 4 or 5 toxicity  
• grade III or IV acute GVHD within 6 weeks of the 1st dose of ALT -
803  
 Efficacy  is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of > 2500 
cells/μl sustained for more than 24 hours  in ≥ 2 of 3 patients (or ≥ 4 of 6)  
within a cohort .   
 The specific dose finding procedure  based on traditional 3+3 design to 
determine MTD or MED is list ed in the following table. The basic idea is 
that: 
• If the current dose level is neither too toxic nor very effective, 
escalate to the next higher dose level;  
• If the current dose level is toxic to a certain degree, further evaluate  
the current dose level  for both toxicity and efficacy . If it turns out the 
current dose is neither too toxic nor very effective, escalate to the next higher dose level; if the current dose is very effective, stop and 
declare the current dose the MED (below MTD); if the current dose is too toxic, regardless of its efficacy, de- escalate to the next lower 
dose level.

April 12 , 2016  Page 49 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  • If the current dose level is too toxic, regardless of its efficacy, de-
escalate to the next lower dose level.   
 The number of patients required in this dose finding phase would range from 6 patients at minimum to 3 6 patients at maximum.    
 Note:  In February  2014 dose level 1 was expanded to 6 patients total to 
gain additional experience before continuing with the dose escalation plan (refer to section 6.2.1 for rationale ). 
 Note:  with the April 28, 2015 version of the protocol the administration route was changed from intravenous to subcutaneous and dose level 3 (6 mcg/kg) was repeated to ensure safety.  
 Note:  with the April 2016 version of the protocol, dose level 4 was expanded to enroll 6 patients despite the absence of dose limiting toxicity 
in the 1
st couple of patients treated at this dose level.  Clinical benefit (at 
least 1 complete response and several patients with stable disease) has been noted in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.  Therefore rather than 
continuing the dose escalation plan and moving to dose level 5 (ALT -803 
at 20 mcg/kg), it was decided to enroll 6 at dose level 4 to gain additional toxicity data.  Once 6 evaluable patients are treated at the ALT-803 10 
mcg/kg level a decision will be made to either continue dose escalation, or 
more likely, proceed to the extended phase using dose level 4.

contin ues according to the same scheme.  
11.2 The Extended Phase  
The primary objective of this phase  is to study the potential efficacy of 
IL-15 super agonist complex, ALT -803, in patients with hematologic 
malignancy who have relapsed after allogeneic transplant .  The ALT -803 
MTD/MED identified during dose finding will be the dose used during this 
enrollment.  Efficacy  of ALT -803 will be measured using rates of 
remission induction.  
 An optimal Simon’s two- stage design  will be used in this phase to test 
the null hypothesis of ≤ 10% remission induction versus the alternative 
hypothesis of ≥ 30% remission induction.  For sample size estimation, we 
set the power (the probability of concluding efficacy of ALT -803 given it is 
truly effective) at 80%, and significance level (the probability of concluding efficacy of ALT -803 given it is actually not effective) at 0.05.  If 2 or fewer 
of the first 14 patients (including the 6 patients treated at the same dose level from the dose finding phase) respond to ALT -803, we will conc lude 
ALT-803 is unworthy of further study and terminate the trial early.

April 12 , 2016  Page 51 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  Otherwise, the trial goes on to the second stage, and an additional 23 
patients will be studied. If the total number of patients responding to ALT -
803 is ≤ 5, we will conclude ALT -803 is not effective.   
 
11.3 Enrollment Plan  
With the change in April 2016 and enrollment of 2 additional patients at 
dose level 4, the minimum additional enrollment during the dose-
escalation phase will be 2 with a maximum additional 14 patients ( 2 at 
dose level 4 and 6 each at the 2 remaining doses).   After completion of the 
dose escalation phase, a minimum of 8 additional patients with a maximum of 31 additional patients will be required to complete the trial. The maximum total additional patients with both phases will be 45 with 37 
evaluable at the end of the phase II trial.  
 Based on enrollment in this protocol over the past year  (N=17), our goal is 
to complete this study in 24 to 36 months.  
 A patient will be replaced and the ALT -803 dose level cohort reassigned if: 
• the patient does not start ALT -803 
• if more than 1 dose of ALT -803 is missed for a reason other than 
DLT 
• patient requires more than two separate 1 week delays from the 
planned ALT -803 administration day   
11.4 Stopping Rules  
Excessive Toxicity  
Because of severity of the diseases, toxicity  of ALT -803 needs to be 
evaluated carefully. The hypothesized rate of having  grade 3-4 non-
hematologic, non- relapse and non- infectious toxicity (except for fevers 
alone) based on the NCI’s CTCAE  version 4 is encountered is 5% .  
 The goal is to construct a boundary based on toxicity such that the probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the true toxicity is equal to 5% and our sample size is at most 31 patients. This means 
enrollment will be stopped and the study re- evaluated if there are 2 
patients with a grade 3 -4 non-hematologic, non- relapse and non-
infectious toxicity (except for fevers alone) occurring out of the first 7 patients, 3 out of 16, 4 out of 29, or 5 at any time.    
 Overall Mortality At Day 60 Post Relapse  
The hypothesized rate of overall mortality at  day 60 is 20%.  
 The goal is to construct a boundary based on mortality such that the probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the true mortality rate is equal to 20% and our sample size is at most 31 patients. This means 
HM2013-12:  IL-15 Super Agonist ALT-803 to Treat Relapse Of Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic SCT  
 
 
   
April 12 , 2016  Page 52 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  enrollment will be stopped and the study re- evaluated if there are 3 
patients with an event out of the first 4 patients, 4 out of 6, 5 out of 10, 
6 out 13, 7 out of 16, 8 out of 20, 9 out of 23, 10 out of 27  or 11 at any 
time.     
 
Grad e III-IV Acute GvHD  
The hypothesized rate of having  grade III-IV Acute GvHD  is 5% .  
 The goal is to construct a boundary based on toxicity such that the probability of early stopping is at most 10% if the true toxicity is equal to 5% and our sample size is at most 31patients. This means 
enrollment will be stopped and the study re- evaluated if there are 2 
patients with GVHD occurring  within 6 weeks of the 1st dose of ALT -
803 out of the first 7 patients, 3 out of 16, 4 out of 29 or 5  at any time.   
The stopping rules were developed using Pocock stopping boundaries.( 28) 
 
Note: these stopping rules are based on a per patient count, not the 
absolute number of events  experienced by an individual patient.  No single 
patient can count more than once toward these stopping rules. 
11.5 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for correlative outcomes such as number and function of NK cells, T cells, and T regulatory cells.  The changes in these correlates pre and post therapy will be evaluated using either nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test or parametric paired t test. For tim e-to-event data, Kaplan- Meier curves will be generated if no 
competing risk is presented for the event, otherwise cumulative incidence will be calculated for the event.
 
 
12 Conduct of the Study  
12.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The study will be conducted in accordance the appropriate regulatory requirement(s).  Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of the study and the integrity of the data collected.  Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study and retained according to the 
appropriate regulations.   
12.2 Ethical Considerations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The IRB will review all appropriate study documentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety and well -being of 
the patients.  The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB approval has been obtained.  The protocol, consent, written information given to the

1.  Relapse after previous allogeneic stem cell transplant for one of the following hematologic malignancies 
- acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, 
myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia meeting the following: 
o For non- CML, relapse will be defined based on disease specific morphologic criteria from a bone 
marrow biopsy and aspirate or recurrence of disease specific cytogenetics.  For disease specific definition of relapse, see appendix III.  Relapse can be determined morphologically with < 5 percent blasts if definitive relapse can be determined.  Equivocal results for relapse should result in a 
repeated test after an appropriate time interval (suggested 1 month) to determine el igibility.  
o For CML, relapse will be defined as any cytogenetic evidence of a Philadelphia chromosome or 
persistence of BCR/ABL rearrangements by molecular testing on at least two measurements over a 6 month interval.  If cytogenetics are normal and there is PCR evidence of a BCR/ABL fusion, patients will be eligible if they have evidence of a quantitative increase in CML measured either by 
quantitative PCR or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).  
o For Chronic Phase CML patients only:  
• must have failed (no response in 3 months or incomplete response at 6 months) or refused treatment with TKI therapy  
• must have failed (defined as incomplete response or relapse) or refused DLI

April 12 , 2016  Page 59 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  Appendix III – Disease Specific Response Criteria  
 
CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA (CML) RESPONSE CRITERIA  
 
In chronic phase CML , a hematologic response was defined as a 50% reduction in WBC counts from baseline sustained 
for at least 2 weeks. A Complete Hematologic Response (CHR) was defined as WBC < 10,000 per mm3 and platelet 
count < 450,000 per mm3 maintained for at least 4 weeks.  
 
In blast crisis CML , a hematologic response is defined as a decrease in bone marrow blast count to < 5%, the 
disappearance of blasts in the peripheral blood, an absolute neutrophil count > 1000 cells/mm3 and platelet count > 
100,000 cells/mm3.  Patients who did not meet the criteria for a complete hematologic response may be categorized 
according to marrow response.  
A marrow response is defined as either a decrease in the blast count to < 5% or between 5- 15% regardless of peripheral 
blood cell counts.  
• Disease progression is defined as an increase in marrow blasts > 15%, increase in peripheral blood blasts > 5% or WBC > 20,000 cells/mm
3.  
• A relapse is defined as evidence of disease progression or death.  
 
Cytogenetic Response  
Cytogenetic responses (CR) were defined in terms of percentage of cells in metaphase existing within the bone marrow 
that were Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive. These responses were based upon a sample size of twenty cells in 
metaphase.  
• A Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCR) was defined as no Ph(+) cells.  
• A partial CR was defined as < 35% cells that were Ph(+).  
• A minor CR was defined as 35- 65% cells that were Ph(+).  
• A lack of CR was identified when >65% cells were Ph(+).  
• A major cytogenetic response (MCR) is comprised of complete and partial responses.  
Molecular response  
Standardization studies are ongoing and definition of molecular response currently varies.  
• Complete molecular response: no detectable bcr -abl transcripts by RT -PCR.  
• Major molecular response: ≥ 3- log reduction in the level of bcr -abl transcripts or bcr -abl/abl ratio ≤ 0.05%.

April 12 , 2016  Page 62 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL) RESPONSE CRITERIA  
 
Complete Remission 
CR requires all of the following criteria as assessed at least 3 months after completion of therapy:  
• Absence of clonal lymphocytes in the peripheral blood.  
• Absence of significant lymphadenopathy (e.g., lymph nodes > 1.5 cm in diameter)  by physical examination or CT 
scan.  
• No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by physical examination or by CT scan.  
• Absence of constitutional symptoms.  
• Blood counts above the following values:  
o Polymorphonuclear leukocytes 1.5 x 109/L or more.  
o Platelets more than 100 x 109/L 
o Hemoglobin more than 11.0 g/dL; untransfused.  
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed at least 3 months after the last treatment if clinical and 
laboratory results demonstrate a CR. The marrow should be analyzed by flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry to demonstrate that the marrow is free of clonal B -CLL cells. Cases with residual CLL cells by conventional flow 
cytometry or immunohistochemistry are defined as partial remission (PR).  
 
In some cases, lymphoid nodules can be found (formerly used to define nodular  PR), which often reflect residual 
disease. Therefore, these nodules should be assessed by immunohistochemistry to define whether they are 
comprised of CLL cells.  
 
CR with Incomplete Bone Marrow Recovery (CRi)  
For the definition of this category, CRi, the marrow evaluation should be performed with scrutiny and not show  any 
clonal infiltrate.  
 Partial Remission  
PR is defined by at least one of these parameters and needs to be documented for a minimal duration of 2 months:  
• A decrease in the number of blood lymphocytes by less than 50% or more from  the value before therapy.  
• A decreased lymph node size by 50% or more in the sum products of up to 6 lymph nodes, or in one lymph node 
diameter if only a single lymph node was  present before therapy, as assessed by CT scan.  
• No increase in any lymph node, and no new enlarged lymph node. In small lymph nodes (<2 cm), an increase of 
less than 25% is not considered to be significant.  
• A decrease in the size of the liver and/or spleen by 50% or more as defined by CT  scan.  
• The blood count should show one of the following re sults:  
• Polymorphonuclear leukocytes at 1.5 x 10
9/L or more or 50% improvement over baseline without 
granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF)  support.  
• Platelet counts greater than 100 x 109/L or 50% improvement over baseline.  
• Hemoglobin greater than 11.0 g/dL or 50% improvement over baseline without red blood cell transfusions or 
erythropoietin support.  
 
 Progressive Disease  
Progressive disease is characterized by at least one of the following:  
• Constitutional symptoms persisting for more than 1 month.  
• Progression of lymphadenopathy.  
• Appearance of any new lesion, such as enlarged lymph nodes (>1.5 cm),  splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or 
other organ infiltrates.  
• An increase by 50% or more in greatest determined diameter of any previous site.  
• A lymph node of 1 to 1.5 cm must increase by 50% or more to a size greater than cm in the longest axis. A lymph node of more than 1.5 cm must increase to more than 2.0 cm in the longest axis.  
• An increase of 50% or more in the sum of the product of diameters of multiple nodes.  
• An increase in the liver or spleen size by 50% or more or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.  
• An increase in the number of blood lymphocytes by 50% or more with at least  5000 B lymphocytes per 
microliter.  
• Transformation to a more aggressive histology (e.g., Richter syndrome).  
HM2013-12:  IL-15 Super Agonist ALT-803 to Treat Relapse Of Hematologic Malignancy After Allogeneic SCT  
 
 
   
April 12 , 2016  Page 63 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  Whenever possible, this diagnosis should be established by lymph node biopsy.  
After treatment: The progression of any cytopenia (unrelated to autoimmune cytopenia), as documented by a 
decrease of Hb levels by more than 2 g/dL or to less than 10 g/dL, or by a decrease of platelet counts by more than 
50% or to less  than 100 x 109/L, which occurs at least 3 months after treatment, defines disease progression, if the 
marrow biopsy demonstrates an infiltrate of clonal CLL cells.  
 
Stable Disease  
Patients who have not achieved a CR or a PR, and who have not exhibited progressive disease, will be considered to 
have stable disease.

International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma ( BGM Durie  2006)  
 
Response  IMWG Criteria  
sCR CR as defined below plus normal FLC ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow2 
by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence3 
CR Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue 
plasmacytomas and < 5% plasma cells in bone marrow2 
VGPR  Serum and urine M -protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or > 
90% reduction in serum M -protein plus urine M -protein level < 100 mg/24 hour  
PR > 50% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 hours urinary M-protein by 
>90% or to < 200 mg/24 hour  
 
If the serum and urine M- protein are unmeasurable,4 a > 50% decrease in the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M- protein criteria  
 If serum and urine M- protein are not  measurable, and serum free light assay is also not 
measureable, > 50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M- protein, provided 
baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was > 30%  
 
In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a > 50% reduction in the 
size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required  
MR Not applicable  
No change/Stable 
disease  Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, or progressive disease  
Plateau  Increase of > 25% from lowest response value in any one or  more of the following:  
 
•Serum M- component and/or (the absolute increase must be > 0.5 g/dL)5 
•Urine M- component and/or (the absolute increase must be > 200 mg/24 h)  
•Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M- protein levels; the difference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels. The absolute increase must be > 10 
mg/dL •Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; the absolute percentage must be > 10%
6  
•Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas  
•Development of hypercalcaemia (corrected serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 
mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder  
Relapse from CR4 
(To be used only if 
the end point 
studied is DFS)7 Any one or more of the following:  
•Reappearance of serum or urine M- protein by immunofixation or electrophoresis  
•Development of > 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow6 
•Appearance of any other sign of progression (i.e., new plasmacytoma, lytic bone lesion, 
or hypercalcaemia)

Note: A clarification to IMWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in patients in whom the only measurable disease is by serum FLC  
levels: CR in such patients is defined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26 –1.65 in addition to CR criteria listed above. VGPR in such 
patients is defined as a >90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels.  
1. Confirmation with repeat bone marrow biopsy not needed.  
2. Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the kappa/lambda ratio. An abnorma l kappa/lambda ratio by 
immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is kappa/lambda of > 4:1 or < 1:2.  
3. All relapse categories require two consecutive assessments made at any time before classification as relapse or disease 
progression and/or the institution of any new therapy. In the IMWG criteria, CR patients must also meet the criteria for progressive 
disease shown here to be classified as progressive disease for the purposes of calculating time to progression and progression-free survival. The definitions of relapse, clinical relapse and relapse from CR are not to be used in calculation of time to progression or progression-free survival.

April 12 , 2016  Page 66 of 69 CPRC #2012LS023  4. For progressive disease, serum M -component increases of >1 gm/dL are sufficient to define relapse if starting M -component is >5 
g/dL.  
5. Relapse from CR has the 5% cut -off versus 10% for other categories of relapse.  
6. For purposes of calculating time to progression and progression-free survival, CR patients should also be evaluated using criteria 
listed above for progressive disease.

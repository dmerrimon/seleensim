 Analysis:  
Upcoming generations are proving to have an interest in aesthetic dermatology treatme nts and will 
drive demand for innovated products, procedures, and practice design.
1 Due to this shift in patient 
base, practices need to evolve to adapt to the newer generational ideologies. There have been rapid advances in RF technology over the past few years and the nonsurgical treatment using this energy source offers great promise to our aging population.
2 Radiofrequency micro needling technology 
for the treatment of dermatologic conditions needs to be further investigated to optimize treatment 
parameters for  safe and effective non-ablative treatments.

informed consent and their involvement in the study. Subjects who sign the informed consent will 
be screened to confirm eligibility and if eligible , will be assigned a subject identification number. 
Subjects will be de- identified through their subject identification number, which will be stored in a 
secure location.  Subject identification numbers will be generated chronologically and assigned 
only to subjects who have met all the study selection criteria and have signed the informed consent form.  The informed consent will be obtained prior to a subject’s involvement in any study related procedures.  A subject will be considered enrolled in the study once they have signed the informed consent form. Employees of the Sponsor will be required to sign both the main informed consent form as well as an employee consent form .  
 
2.6 Pre-Treatment  Procedures 
If the subject is of childbearing potential (i.e. females not post -menopausal or not surgically 
sterile), then they will be asked if they are pregnant, the date of their last menstrual cycle , and 
perform a pregnancy test. If the treatment is on the abdomen, a urine pregnancy test must be performed before each treatment.  A urine pregnancy test may be conducted at the Investigators 
discretion during the study . If a urine  pregnancy test is conducted , then a negative result must b e 
obtained within 24 hours prior to the treatment. 
 
Urine Pregnancy Test Procedure : 
1. A urine sample is tested mid -stream  or by cup sample with an indicator stick.  
2. Negative results are  indicated  on the indicator stick.  
 
• The following Pre -Treatment instructions will be reviewed:  
o Remove all  jewelry and  makeup, including eye makeup, lotions or sun block and wash 
facial area prior to treatment.  
o For an optimum treatment, keep hydrated by drinking water (at least 8 cups daily) or hydrating fluids, such as Gatorade, and avoid drinking alcohol for several days in advance. 
o For five to seven days prior to treatment, at the physician’s discretion, avoid therapies that may cause erythema (redness) or irritation such as Retin A or products containing Isotretinoin, glycolic and or salicylic acid.  
o Shave visible hair from the treatment area. Male beards should be shaved day of treatment. RF follows the path of least resistance and the hair will receive the energy . 
• Photographs will be taken prior to the first treatment.

• Procedure for the Potenza™ device: 
o The treatment area will be identified and may be marked with a surgical marker.  
o Anesthe sia (such as a topical  or local ), air cooling , and/or Nitronox will be used  at the 
discretion of the Investigator.  
o A neutral pad will be placed in an area determined by the Clinician  to maintain standard 
energy settings and requires less power from the device during the treatment.  
o Test spots may be performed prior to the fi rst treatment.  Test spots may be performed 
prior to the first treatment. It will follow a similar procedure to treatment but only in an inconspicuous place, such as behind the ear, in an area no larger than 2in x 2in. 
o The tip  will be placed in contact with  the skin.  
o The entire defined treatment area will then be treated as instructed by the Operator’s Manual . 
o Parameters may be adjusted throughout the treatment and will determined by the Clinician . 
o Subjects will be asked to report the general level of treatment discomfort/pain on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (maximum intolerable pain).  
• Photographs may  be taken during treatment.  
• Subjects may receive up to 5 treatments  every 4 weeks (+/ - 2 weeks) which will be determined 
by the Investigator. 
• The additional treatments will follow the same procedure.  
 
2.8 Post Treatment  Procedures  
• Adverse events will be documented  after treatment.  
• Photographs may be taken post treatment.  
• Clinician ease of use and subject treatment experience questionnaires may be performed.  
• The following post treatment instructions  will be reviewed :  
o Be careful not to expose area of treatment to external stimulation for at least  2 days after 
treatment.  
 Avoid ultraviolet rays and apply sunscreen. 
 Do not to scrub the skin or exfoliate for several days after treatment.  
o Refrain from high intensity exercise  (such as running, weightlifting, aerobics), hot bath or 
saunas that may cause increase in skin temperature for 5 days after treatment . 
o Refrain from drinking  alcohol or taking medicine that interferes with blood coagulation 
such as aspirin for 2 weeks after treatment.  
o If heat sensation  or erythema  (redness)  after treatment is bothersome , use an ice pack  to the 
treated area  at home. 
o If the skin in the treatment area  feels tight or dry, apply plenty of moisturizing cream, such 
as Neutrogena. 
o After the procedure, inflammation or edema  (swelling) may block the pores and acne can  
temporarily worsen  (about 7 days). If acne worsens, do not pick or squeeze as pigmentation 
changes may occur. 
o Sleep in a semi reclined position for the first 2 -3 nights to minimize facial swelling . 
o Apply soothing facial mask as needed.

• All subjects may receive a 24 hour phone call  or attend a visit post each treatment and will 
receive a phone call or attend a visit 1 week (2 -10 days) after each treatment to record side 
effects .  
• The study subjects are required to return to the  investigative site for a follow -up evaluation at 
30 days post last treatment.   
• Subjects may be asked to return for an optional follow up visit 90 days post last treatment. 
• Photographs will be taken , subject and physician questionnaires will be performed, and adverse 
events will be documented  at all follow up visits.  
• Some subjects may have an incomplete response or no response by the end of the study. At the end of the study, treatments using an FDA approved/cleared treatment method may be discussed with the subject and obtained at the cost of the subject.  
 
2.10 Biopsy Portion of the Study  
• Up to 6 subjects will enroll in the biopsy portion of this study. If the subject has enrolled , the 
following will also be performed:  
o Biopsies will be taken  from the test spot area day of treatment and  may be taken 0-24 
hours, 25-48 hours, 3-7 days, and 30 days post treatment.  
o Biopsy subjects may receive up to 2 biopsies at each visit, totaling 10 biopsies . 
o A local  anesthetic , such as lidocaine, may be injected to the area prior to biopsy. 
o A 2 mm or 3mm punch biopsy (based on Physician assessment) will be taken from the treatment area.  
o Sutures will be uses to close the incision site.  
o The subject will be required to attend a 1 week (7-14 days) post the 7 day biopsy visit and  a 
1 week (7-14 days) post 30 day biopsy follow up visit to remove the sutures  and assess side 
effects .    
• The following post biopsy treatment instructions will be r eviewed:  
o Slight redness, initial tenderness to the wound site is normal; however, if you experience more redness, swelling, pain, pus, or drainage contact the study site immediately. 
o If the biopsy site begins to bleed, apply direct pressure for 10 -20 minutes. If it continues to 
bleed, call the study site immediately. 
o Keep the wound dry today and remove bandage in 24 hours and leave off. 
o Avoid hot tubs, pools, and ocean until sutures are removed.  Avoid soaking in water until 14 days after your biopsy. 
o When showering, wash carefully and do not scrub or traumatize the treated skin, or allow spray of shower to strike the skin directly.  If the skin is treated harshly, this can increase the risk of scarring. 
o After showering, lightly pat dry the wound or let it air dry, then cover the biopsy site with an application of Vaseline (or petroleum jelly) at least 1 -2 times daily.  Keeping the wound 
moist reduces infection, minimizes scarring, and prevents crust formation over the wound.  
o Band -Aids (or any generic Adhesive Bandages) may be used for sleeping or in daily 
routines where the area may be rubbed/irritated.   Whenever possible, keep Band -Aid (or 
generic Adhesive Bandage) off of the area and keep the area moist with Vaseline (or petroleum jelly) as p reviously described but do not allow drying out and forming a hard 
scab.

o For any wound discomfort, you may take Tylenol as needed, or use cold compresses for up to 20 minutes hourly as needed.  If using ice, it should be wrapped in a plastic and then a cloth to avoid burning your skin and wetting your bandage. 
o Avoid picking at the wound site, which increases risk of infection and scarring. 
o In order for the wound to heal properly and not leave bumpy scars, be careful not to overstretch the wound site area.  As a wound heals, it will be weaker than the surrounding skin and can even "pop open" the sutures (stitches) if stretched too much.  Sport or strenuous exercises that can pull at the wound site are best avoided for at least the next 3 days and up to one w eek. 
o Return for suture removal within 7 - 14 days as instructed per study protocol. If applied, Steri -strips must be kept dry as they are more likely to separate when wet. Steri -strips will 
usually fall off by themselves or you may be advised by the study doctor to remove them when the wound healed. 
o ONCE SUTURES ARE OUT: To minimize sore formation and to improve the final appearance of your skin, it is very important to keep the wound site area covered with the Vaseline for the next few days, until there is no more crust forming and the skin has completely healed.  
o Temporary discoloration at the wound site is normal and should gradually fade over the next few months.  Please protect newly healed biopsied area with SPF and avoid sunburn. 
 
2.11 Unscheduled Visits  
An unscheduled visit may be performed at any time during the study at the subject’s request or as deemed necessary by the site Investigator. The date and reason for the unscheduled visit will be recorded in the source documentation.  
2.12 Replacement of Subjects

2.14 Evaluation Methods  
Photographs:  
Photographs will be taken at all visits and will be used to assess safety and efficacy of treatment.  
 Treatment Discomfort/Pain Evaluation:  
Subjects will be asked to report the general level of treatment discomfort on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (maximum intolerable pain) using the universal pain assessment tool (App endix B)  
 
Subject Questionnaire :  
The subject will be asked their level of satisfaction using a 6- point Likert scale that ranges from 
“extremely satisfied” to “extremely unsatisfied.”  
 
Subject Satisfaction  
Rating  Description  
6 Extremely Satisfied  
5 Satisfied  
4 Slightly Satisfied  
3 Slightly Unsatisfied  
2 Dissatisfied  
1 Extremely Unsatisfied  
 Physician Questionnaire:  The Clinical Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (CGAIS) ranging from “worse” to “very much improved” will be used to judge the improvement as seen by the treating Investigator. 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 Blinded Evaluation:  
Three blinded independent reviewers will perform a photographic evaluation in which they will be asked to identify pre-treatment images when compared to post treatment images. The reviewers 
will be Board Certified Dermatologist and be chosen based on availability and have relevant clinical experience. They will attend a training session prior to grading.    
 
Skin Biopsies:  
Biopsies will be obtained to examine the effects on the skin following radiofrequency treatment. Sections of skin will be removed using the punch biopsy technique to render a microscopic Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale Assessment  
Rating  Description  
1 Very Much Improved - Optimal cosmetic result in this subject  
2 Much Improved - Marked improvement in appearance form the initial 
condition, but not completely optimal for this subject.   
3 Improved - Obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition, but a 
re-treatment is indicated.  
4 No Change - The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition.  
5 Worse - The appearance is worse than the original condition.

diagnosis.  Each specimen will first be preserved with a fi xative and then stained using 
Hemotoxylin & Eosin, Verhoeff and Masson Red/Fast Green or nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (NBTC) staining methods. If using
 Hemotoxylin & Eosin, Verhoeff and Masson Red/Fast Green 
staining, s amples will be assessed and evaluated by the amount of collagen and elastin stained.  If 
using NBTC staining, samples will be assessed and evaluated to differentiate between the blue-stained viable cells and the unstained thermally damaged cells. A histological analysis will be provided by t he Investigator.  
 
2.15 Adverse Event Recording  
All data captured must be supported by the Investigator’s timely assessment and documentation of the adverse event in the case report forms or source documents.  All documented adverse events will be reviewed by the Sponsor or designee to determine whether the adverse event meets regulatory reporting requirements and to ensure timely adverse event reporting to me et local and 
global regulatory requirements. All adverse events must be followed until their resolution.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to the Potenza™ Device: 
• Temporary erythema: area of treatment may turn red right after treatment, but this symptom disappear s within 48 hours after treatment 
• Temporary tingling: slight edema may occur right after treatment, but this symptom 
disappears within 48 hours after treatment.  
• Burning sensation: patients may feel uncomfortable temporarily while receiving treatment.  
 
Other possible adverse effects may include  pain/tenderness, pinpoint bleeding, folliculitis , skin 
burn, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, infection, paresis , scarring,  bruising, acne, dryness, 
eye twitching, eye tearing , petechiae, skin textural irregularity,  and allergic reaction which may be 
transient and resolve over time.  
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Neutral Pad: Mild heat  or hot spots  may be felt during treatment by the subject.
 If the subject reports heat at the 
pad site, evaluate the site, check for epidermal injury . Skins burns may occur if subject does not 
report if the pad becomes too hot.   
 Adverse Events Pertaining to Anesthesia : 
Topical anesthesia, such as but not limited to; EMLA, LMX and Lidocaine/Tetracaine, or a local anesthetic will be use d. The most common side effects for most anesthetics include redness, 
blanching, swelling and application site reaction.   
 Less common sid e effects include; large swellings that look like hives on the skin or in the mouth 
or throat. Pain, burning, paleness and altered temperature sensation. Subjects may be allergic to the contents of any anesthetic which may cause allergic- type reactions inc luding anaphylactic symptoms 
and life- threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people.   
 
Adverse Events Pertaining to Nitronox:  
May experience nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating, euphoria, excitement, deep sedation, drowsiness, sleep, dizziness, lightheadedness, dysphoria, amnesia, and headaches.

 Adverse Events Pertaining to the Surgical Marker:  
Using surgical marker has minimal risks and may produce effects on the body such as redness or a rash. Markings may remain visible for a few days or may be removed with alcohol.  Biopsies  
Complication with biopsies can include pain, redness, swelling, infection, bleeding, scarring and skin texture irregularities.  
 Other Cautions:  
Incomplete response or no response may occur since some subjects may not respond to treatment.  
 
2.16 Statistical Analysis  
 
2.16.1 Hypothesis 
For this study to be considered a success, the Investigator and subject satisfaction rates will be 
≥80% and if the side effect profile is acceptable to the Physician as it relates to this type of treatment.  In cases where the subject’s  improvement is being gr aded on a scale, such as the GAIS 
scale, we will test the statistical significance of our results against a hypothetical population that would have no change (average score of 4).  For secondary objectives to be considered a success, the results from any assessments will need to be statistically significant or have ≥80% response rate.   
 
2.16.2 Sample Size Rationale  
Based on the need for the data collected from this study, it was determined that a total of 1 20 
patients would be required for the study, including departures.   
 2.16.3 Patient Populations Interim results may be collected and reported.  All data will be analyzed at the end of the study.  The primary analysis will be performed by the intention- to-treat approach.  Everyone who begins 
the treat ment is  part of the study whether he or she completes the study or not.  Additional per-
protocol analysis may also be performed on subjects who complete the entire clinical trial according to the protocol.  The most appropriate method of handling missing values will be chosen based on the individual trial goals, endpoints and context.  The analysis of demographic, medical history, and efficacy variables will be based on all patients who are randomized and receive at least one treatment. The analysis of safety data will be based on all patients who are randomized, receive at least one tre atment, and have at least some safety data.  
  2.16.4 Analysis of Demographic and Medical History Variables  
Summaries will be prepared for all important demographic and medical history variables.  For 
quantitative variables summaries will include the sample  size, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum.   For these variables the treatment groups will be compared using either 
a t-test or a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, as appropriate.   For categorical variables the summaries will

Version  7.0: December 7, 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 32 
  
include the sample si ze and the number and percent of patients for each outcome.  For these 
variables the treatment groups will be compared using Fisher’s Exact test.   Statistical significance 
will be declared if the two -sided p-value is < 0.05.  
  2.16.5 Analysis of Efficacy Variables  
The primary efficacy variable is the change from baseline to visit 8 (30 days post last treatment) with respect to the treated condition evaluated by physician grading with CGAIS.  Baseline is 
defined as the last assessment prior to the first treatment.  The change from baseline to visit 8 will be analyzed using a Mixed Model Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance.   A pairwise treatment 
group comparison at visit 8 will be performed using the results of this analysis.   If a patient has no 
post- baseline assessment of the primary efficacy variable the patient data will be excluded from 
the statistical analysis of the improvement.   Statistical significance with respect to the treatment 
group comparison at visit 8 will be declared if the two -sided p- value is < 0.05.  For each treatment 
group summaries will be prepared for both the observed assessment and the change from baseline.   Subject satisfa ction results from Visit 9 will also be included in the summary.  The 
summaries will include the sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  Categorical variables will also include a summary which will include the number and percent of patients for each outcome.   The statistical significance of the mean change from 
baseline for each treatment group will be determined using a student’s paired t- test.   
 The secondary efficacy variables will be determined at a later date based on image grading.   As with the primary efficacy variable the assessment at Visit 8 (30 days post last treatment) will be primary.   The analysis and summaries for any secondary efficacy variables will be the same as that 
described for the primary efficacy variable.   Statistical significance with respect to the treatment 
group comparison at visit 8 will be declared if the two -sided p- value is < 0.05.   
  2.16.6 Analysis of Safety Variables  
Safety will be assessed through the degree of pain/discomfort related to th e procedure (universal 
pain scale) and the collection of Adverse Events throughout the course of the study.  For each 
treatment group these variables will be summarized.  The summaries will include the number and percen t of patients for each outcome.  No statistical comparisons will be performed for any of 
these variables.  
 3.0  RISK  ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT  
3.1 Risk Determination  
This device study used in this study does not meet the FDA definition for a Significant Risk 
Device study per 21 CFR 812.3(m).  The refore , the sponsor determines that this is a non -
significant risk device study.  Significant risk device means an investigational device that:  
(1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a 
potential for serious risk to the health,  safety, or welfare of a subject;

__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Version  7.0: December 7, 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 32 
  
(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or (4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
 
3.2 Risk Management  
The Investigator in this clinical trial has been invited to participate based on his/her previous experience with  the use of the system and/or  similar systems and industry  experience.  Experience 
with treatments is the most critical element in managing subject risk in this trial.  
 In addition, as with any study, there is a risk of bias. Objective evaluation methods may be used in conjunction with subjective evaluation methods when feasible.  The value of the compensation to the clinical investigator for conducting the study is not influenced by the study outcome.  If photographic results are listed as the pri mary objective , they are to be evaluated by blinded 
evaluators who did not partake in the study.  If information concerning investigator assessment of improvement or investigator satisfaction is collected , then it is not listed as an objective for the stud y. 
 All other known risks will be disclosed to the subject via the informed consent process. Since this is an elective procedure and the subjects are volunteers, it can be assumed that their signature on the informed consent is indicative of their agreemen t to accept the risks involved.  
 The risks to the subjects who participate in this study are the same as those for the subject undergoing similar ablative radiofrequency treatment s. It is possible to have an adverse reaction to 
the Potenze™  device use. There may be some side effects that w e don’t know about yet. 
 
3.3 Risk Analysis 
 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION: 
Radiofrequency (RF) technology is commonly used in surgery, noninvasive treatments and aesthetic applications. RF technology combined with micro needling is a safe method for non-
ablative (A non-wounding device treatment which heats underlying skin) treatment because energy can be precisely delivered through the skin to the dermal tissue beneath with minimal injury to the  
epidermis.   
 Aging skin shows decreased collagen synthesis and alteration of fiber networks. By gently heating dermis tissue ( which is comprised of collagen, elastic fibers and ground substance ), both 
immediate effects (collagen contraction) and long-term effects (wound -healing r esponse with 
neocollagen production) will occur. RF -induced thermal injury to the dermal tissue will produce a 
microinflammatory response to  induce collagen denaturation, contraction, and subsequent 
synthesis as well as elastin and ground substance production.
iii Microneedling will cause discrete 
coagulative injury in the dermis while sparing the epidermis. This allows for a faster healing time 
and fewer complications in the treatment area . 
 
The extent of collagen shrinkage, fibroblast activ ation, fibroplasia and neocollagenesis in the 
different skin layers is based on a complex multivariate mechanism, which depends on the

temperature distribution and timing.2 Further investigation of parameter optimization is necessary 
to achieve safe and efficacious results.   
 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION : 
There are two risks identified with the  Potenza™  device used in this study. The first risk  identifi ed 
is the efficacy  of the treatment. The re is a lack  of clinical data for evidence of effectiveness when 
treating with the Potenza™  device . The second  risk identified  is the safety profile of the device .  
 
The risk identified with the overall clinical investigation is the integrity  of the data collected . 
 There are multiple  clinical mitigation strate gies for the risks  identified. P roper training o n the 
device and protocol  will be performed.  Data from other comparable devices, such as the Lutronic 
Genius and Infini and Genius Vivace,  will be utilized to minimize side effects and optimize 
treatment outcomes.  Monitoring of the study will be implemented to minimize subject and data 
risks .  
 
ASSESSMENT OF BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED INVESTIGATION:    
The subject may or may not have a reduction in the condition they present with.  
CONSIDERATION OF PATIENT PREFERENCE INFORMATION:  
Many physicians support the use of radiofrequency devices minimally invasive  cosmetic 
treatments due to current patient satisfaction of cosmetic results with the currently available devices. However, there is still a level of interest in novel technologies  that could reduce the need 
for future treatments.   
ASSESSMENT OF UNCERTAINTY:  
There is uncertainty of the safety and efficacy of the treatment with  Potenza™ since it is not 
cleared for use by the FDA .  
 
CONCLUSION:  
The Potenza™ device is  intended for electrocoagulation and hemostasis of soft tissues for dermatologic 
conditions . This device is determined to be a non- significant risk study. The risks posed to the subjects 
and integrity of data are acceptable .

(lighting, distance, background, polarization, etc.) will be reproduced at each visit, so that 
photographs  are suitable for comparison.  Photographs will be taken of the treatment area  for study 
purposes.  If the subject does not wish to have their photographs  taken, they cannot be  in the study.  
 14.0  ADVERSE REACTIONS  DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
All adverse events that occur, starting from the time of the first treatment,  will be recorded in the 
source documents  and Case Report Forms (CRF) . 
Adverse Events (AE) occurring will be captured and followed until the co ndition resolves, 
stabilizes,  is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. Subjects will be instructed tha t 
they may contact the  Investigator at any time throug hout the course of the study.  
The Investigator and/or designated study staff  will review each event and assess its relationship to 
the study device  (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly probable). The following 
definitions will be used for rating relationship to the Potenza™ treatments:  
• Not related – The event is  clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
• Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by other factors such as the subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or a concomitant medication administered to the subject; and does not follow a known response pattern to the investigational product.  
• Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to the study sampling 
sessions; but  could have been produced by other factors such as the subject’s  clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
• Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational 
product administration; and  follows a known response pattern to the investigational product; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the subject.  
• Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temp oral sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the 
subject’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions,  or concomitant medications administered to 
the subject; and either occurs immediately following investigational product administration, or  
improves on stopping the investigational product, or  reappears on repeat exposure, or  there is a 
positive reaction a t the application site.  
 Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3- point severity. Using t he following 
definitions for rating severity will be used:  
• Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with normal everyday  
activ ities.  
• Moderate – sufficiently discomforting and may interfere with normal everyday activities.  
• Severe – incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities.

A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse device experience that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  death, a life -threatening adverse device experience, in -patient hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse device experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject may require medical or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
 If any of the above adverse events are serious as defined by the FDA Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 21, special procedures will be followed.  All serious adverse events will be reported within 24 hours of acknowledgment to the Sponsor whether or not the serious events are deemed sampling session related .  All serious event reporting will adhere to 21 CFR part 812 and the IRB 
will be notified accordingly.     The SAE infor mation will be entered into the database and a desk copy of the complete SAE 
report will be submitted to the study file .  
 Adverse events, whether serious or non- serious, will be followed until the condit ion is resolved, 
stabilized, otherwise explained  or the subject is lost to follow -up.  Adverse events will be captured 
throughout the study and where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to 
document the resolution of event(s). Outcomes may be classified as resolved, imp roved, 
unchanged, worse, fatal, unknown or lost to follow-up.  Following the resolution of any study-associated adverse events there will be no further adverse event reports for that subject.

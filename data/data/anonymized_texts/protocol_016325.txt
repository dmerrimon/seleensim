1.0       PROTOCOL  SUMM ARY AND/OR SCH EMA 
 
The  trial  proposed  is  a  single  arm  phase  II  multicenter  treatment  protocol  designed  to  examine 
engraftment, toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, and u ltimate disease-free survival following a no vel 
cytoreductive regimen including busulfan, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine and ATG for the treatment 
of patients with Fanconi anemia who ha ve severe aplastic anemia (SAA), severe isolated single lineage 
cytopenia (SISLC),  myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous  leukemia (AML), lacking 
HLA-genotypically identical donors using stem ce ll transplants derived from HLA-compatible unrelated 
dono rs or  HLA haplotype-mismatched related don ors. 
 
Candidates for this trial will include patients with Fanco ni anemia who have severe aplastic anemia 
(transfusion de pendent), severe isolated single lineage cytopenia or myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute 
myelogenous  leukemia for whom an allogeneic stem cell transplant is indicated. 
 
All patients will be conditioned for transplantation with intravenous  busulfan (busulfex®) (0.6-.8 
mg/Kg/dose Q 12  hours x 4 doses), cyclopho sphamide (10 mg/Kg/dose x 4 doses) and fludarabine (35 
mg/m2/day x  4 doses). All patients will also receive rabbit ATG (thymoglobulin®) (2.5 mg/Kg/dose x 4 
doses) prior to transplant to promote engraftment. Cyclosporine will be used for prophylaxis against 
GvHD. All patients will also receive G-CSF pos t-transplant to foster engraftment. 
 
Busulfan doses were adjusted ba sed on B usulfan pharmacokinetics. 
 
As of April 2012,  patient accrual is nearly complete. As a result, after the completion of the planned 25 
patient study, we have amended  the protocol to accrue at  most an additional 20 patients in order to gain 
clinical experience using alternative levels of Busulfan. 
 
Previously, 25 patients were treated with 0.8-1.0 mg/kg of Busulfan. In this continuation study, 10 
patients will be treated at 0.6-0.8 mg/kg of Busulfan. If no primary graft failures are observed in these 10 
patients, then a further cohort of 10 patients will be treated at 0.4-0.6 mg/kg. If however, at any time 
during this accrual a graft failure is observed, then the Busulfan dose will be modified and a final cohort 
will be treated at the initial dose of 0.8-1.0 mg/kg. 
 
Although no graft failure has been seen with the dose of .6-.8 mg/kg of  Busulfan, it was decided to enroll 
the remainder of the patients at this coho rt, as a precautionary measure and in order to maintain the safety 
and e ffectiveness of the condition regimen. Some patients have had so me evidence of  mixed ch imerism, 
and we therefore do not  see any benefit in reducing the Busulfan dose any further. 
 
The preferred source of stem ce lls will be peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) induced  and mobilized by 
treatment of the donor with G-CSF for 4-6 days. T-cell depletion will be uniformly performed in all 
centers by pos itive CD34 selection with the use of the Miltenyi system (CliniMACS device). The CD34+ 
peripheral blood progenitors will then be administered to the patients after they ha ve completed 
cytoreduction. 
 
Patients will be carefully monitored for engraftment, chimerism, incidence and severity of acute and 
chronic GvHD, regimen-related toxicity, characteristics of hematopoietic and immune reconstitution and 
survival and disease-free survival. 
 
This  phase  II  trial  is  designed  to  investigate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  a  chemotherapy-based 
cytoreductive regimen plus a CD34+ selected T-cell depleted pe ripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) stem cell

transplant for the treatment of patients with Fanco ni anemia and s evere hematologic disease. The majority 
of patients will receive grafts derived from PBSC and will be the focus of the trial. 
 
The  study  popu lation  will  consist  of  one  patient  popu lation  with  two  types  of  donors:  (1)  HLA- 
compatible unrelated donors, and (2) HLA–mismatched related donors.   Donor preference will be 
determined by each ce nter. All patients eligible for this protocol by virtue of being seen at  a participating 
center and having (1) hematologic disease AND (2) lack of  genotypically matched related donor will be 
captured on the database of this protocol. 
 
It is anticipated that the accrual will last 6 years and a total of approximately 45 PBSC patients will enter 
the study. 
 
In order to reduce patient risk, the study design includes early termination in the event of excessive graft 
failure, grade 3-4 acu te graft-versus-host disease or severe chronic graft-versus host disease, or early 
transplant related mortality during the accrual period. Stopping rules will be utilized. See below for

depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem ce ll transplants after chemotherapy-based cytoreduction using 
intravenous  busulfan, cyclophosp hamide, fludarabine and rabbit ATG. Stem cells will be collected from 
(1) HLA-compatible unrelated donors, or (2) HLA-mismatched related donors. 
The primary objectives of this trial are to establish: 
1. the incidence and q uality of engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution. 
2. the incidence of early transplant related mortality 
3. the incidence and severity of acute GvHD and ch ronic GVHD. 
 
Second ary objectives of this study are to establish initial estimates of: 
4. the incidence of overall survival and disease-free survival over time 
 
3.0       BA CKGROU ND AND RATIONALE 
 
3.1. BACKGROUND 
Fanco ni anemia (FA) is a genetic disease ch aracterized by chromosome fragility, multiple birth defects, 
and an increased risk for hematopoietic disorders and solid tumors (1-2). Progressive bone  marrow failure 
results in aplasia, myelodysplasia and/or leukemia (3). When an  HLA-matched  sibling is identified, s tem 
cell  transplantation  using  cytoreduction  with  low  doses  of  radiation  and  che motherapy  has  been 
successful in curing the hematologic manifestations of FA (4-24). The chromosome fragility of FA and its 
hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and radiation has for some time limited the ability to 
perform marrow transplantation using donors other than HLA-matched  siblings (25-27). In the context of 
alternative donors such as unrelated marrow donors or cord blood, the use of a similar cytoreduction has 
been a ssociated with high rates of rejection/graft failure and GvHD, resulting in poor overall survival (28- 
37). 
 
 
Since the first report of marrow transplantation for FA in 1977 (4), approximately 200+  recipients of 
marrow transplants from HLA-matched  siblings have been reported; the risk of rejection has been less 
than 10%, the risk of developing ac ute and/or chronic GvHD has been approximately 45%, and 69% of 
patients are alive disease-free (4-24). More recent studies however have shown improved results (80%) 
when transplants have been  performed in younger patients, with fewer prior transfusions (13). 
 
Approximately 110  patients with FA were initially reported who received stem cell transplants from 
closely matched unrelated dono rs; 69 reported recently to the Euro pean Group for Blood and Marrow 
Transplantation and ap proximately 40 in the US (28-36). A proportion of these transplants were T-cell 
depleted for the prevention of  GvHD. Overall, there was an increased risk of  rejection of  17-37%, risks of 
grade II-IV GvHD and of chronic GvHD were as high as 50%, and only one third of the patients were 
alive at the time of the reports. The cytoreduction used in the majority of these transplants consisted of 
low dose TBI (450-600 cGy) (TBI), and cyclophosphamide (Cy) (10 mg/Kg x 4) with the addition of 
ATG,  steroids,  and  cyclosporin  A.  In  an  analysis  of  49  patients  with  FA  who  received  stem  cell 
transplants from unrelated dono rs reported by 12 centers, the incidence of acute GvHD grades II-IV was 
52% in conventional grafts and 29% in T-cell-depleted grafts (30). Using elutriation to deplete T-cells the 
Minnesota group observed a 32% incidence of grade II-IV acute GvHD in 20 transplanted patients (35). 
 
Guardiola et al. (33) using CD34+ selection (ISOLEX) to T-cell deplete FA un related bone marrow, 
observed an incidence of only 15% II-IV grade acute GvHD. However, two of the 16 patients died of 
acute GvHD. Graft rejection has also been a major problem for unrelated donor transplants for FA. In 
those patients receiving T-cell-depleted transplants, the incidence of graft failure was 20-37% (29, 30,

35). The presence of lymphoc yte mosaicism (i.e. presence of DEB insensitive cells) was associated with a 
significant increased risk of graft failure (35). Escalation of TBI from 4 50 cGy (standard FA dose) to 600 
cGy d id not decrease the risk of graft rejection in the most recent Minnesota trial (35). In all of the 
unrelated donor trials for patients with FA, infectious mortality has been significant. In a Minnesota trial 
of 29 FA MUD  transplants, eight patients succumbed to invasive Aspergillus infection despite aggressive 
antifungal therapy (35). 
 
Based on the results cited above, the problems associated with stem cell transplants for FA were: immune 
complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), graft rejection, infections, and organ toxicity. 
The challenges to the optimization of stem ce ll transplants for Fanconi anemia using alternative donors 
were thus based on the need for (1) a regimen immunosupp ressive enou gh to allow engraftment, with a 
low risk of  rejection, (2) a regimen for marrow processing (T-cell depletion) that can decrease the risk of 
GvHD, and (3) a regimen that does not give rise to excessive toxicity in children with FA. 
 
Three groups in the US including the University of Minnesota, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer  Center have pioneered new regimens that included  low dose total body 
irradiation, cyclopho sphamide, ATG and the addition of  fludarabine followed by T-cell depleted marrow 
or peripheral blood stem cell transplants (37-39). All three centers have had promising results with 
minimal risks of graft rejection, low rates of graft-versus-host disease and overall promising disease-free 
survival.  However, with the small numbers of patients with FA who undergo allogeneic stem ce ll 
transplants, results of single center trials are difficult to interpret in terms of optimal cytoreductive 
regimens and do sing. In add ition, T-cell depletion methods we re also different in all three centers. 
 
Moreover, the use of TBI in these studies also poses additional concerns with respect to widespread 
adop tion of  one of these approaches. It is possible (based on risks of second ary malignanc ies in non-FA 
patients) that irradiation plays some role in the increased risk of secondary malignanc ies in FA patients. 
To date, a significant number of FA su rvivors of stem ce ll transplantation have developed  solid tumors 
post transplant (40-43). These solid tumors are mostly squ amous cell carcinomas. The relative 
contributions of TBI and  chronic GvHD to the development of such tumors are unknown. However, the 
elimination of TBI coup led with T-cell depletion are aimed at  decreasing these risks. 
 
Based on these data, we propose  to use a non-TBI based cytoreductive regimen of busulfan (instead of 
TBI), cyclophosp hamide and fludarabine with ATG and cyclosporine followed by peripheral blood stem 
cell grafts, aggressively T-cell depleted. 
 
3.2        R ATIONALE  
 
The purpose of the use of busulfan is to avoid the use of TBI and  possibly decrease the risk of secondary 
malignanc ies. 
 
The use of the cyclophosphamide / fludarabine and ATG / CSA combination is because it has been 
successful in most recent trials with limited toxicity and decreased risks of rejection. 
 
The purpose of peripheral blood stem ce lls is to achieve high doses of stem ce lls in order to prevent graft 
rejection. In addition, it could potentially decrease mucositis and possible related infectious morbidity by 
improving time to engraftment.  The use of CD34selected stem ce lls (which are highly T cell depleted) is 
intended  to minimize the risks of GVHD.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNO STIC AGENTS  
 
5.1. Busulfan (busulfex®) 
 
a.   Source and Pharmacology: Supp lier: Orphan  Medical Company; Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating 
agent known chemically as 1,4-butanediol, dimethanesulfonate. BUSULFEX® (busulfan). This is an 
agent in which two labile methanesu lfonate groups are attached to oppo site ends of a four carbon alkyl 
chain. In aqueo us media, bus ulfan hydrolyzes to release the methanesulfonate groups.  This produces 
reactive carbonium ions that can alkylate DNA. DNA damage is thought to be responsible for much of  the 
cytotoxicity of busulfan. 
 
b.   Formulation and Stability:  It is supp lied as a clear, colorless, sterile, solution in 10 mL single use 
ampoules. Each ampoule of BUSULFEX contains 60 mg (6 mg/mL) of busu lfan, the active ingredient, a 
white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of CH3SO2O(CH 2)4OSO2CH 3 and a molecular weight 
of 246 g/mole. Busulfan is dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) 33% wt/wt and polyethylene 
glycol 400, 67% wt/wt. Busulfan’s solubility in water is 0.1 g/L and the pH of a >0.5%  solution in 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP as recommended for infusion reflects the 
pH of the diluent used and ranges from 3.4 to 3.9. 
c.   Solution Preparation: BUSULFEX is supplied as a sterile solution in 10 mL single-use clear glass 
ampoules  each  containing  60  mg  of  busulfan  at  a  concentration  of  6  mg/mL  for  intravenous  use. 
BUSULFEX must be diluted prior to use with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal 
saline) or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (D5W). The diluent quantity should be 10 times the volume of 
BUSULFEX, ensuring that the final concentration of busulfan is approximately 0.5 mg/mL. 
 
d.   Storage  and  Stability:    Unopened  ampules  of  BUSULFEX  must  be  stored  under  refrigerated 
cond itions between 2°  -8° C (36° -46° F). 
 
e.   Administration:  Intravenous, o ver 2 hours. 
 
5.2        Fludara bine (FLUDARA ®) 
 
a.   Source  and  Pharmacology:  Suppl ier:  Berlex  Laboratories,  Inc.  FLUDAR A  FOR  INJECTION 
contains fludarabine phosphate, a fluorinated nucleotide analog of  the antiviral agent vidarabine, 9-ß-D- 
arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A) that is relatively resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase. The 
chemical name for fludarabine phosphate is 9H-Purin-6-amine, 2-fluoro-9-(5-O-phosphon o-ß-D- 
arabinofuranosyl). Fludarabine phosphate is rapidly depho sphorylated to 2-fluoro-ara-A and then 
phosph orylated intracellularly by deox ycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This 
metabolite appears to act by inhibiting DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA 
primase, thus inhibiting DNA synthesis. The mechan ism of action of this antimetabolite is not completely 
characterized and may be multi-faceted. 
 
b.   Formulation and Stability: Each  vial of sterile lyophilized solid cake contains 50 mg of the active 
ingredient fludarabine phosphate, 50 mg of mannitol, and sodium h ydroxide to adjust pH to 7.7. The pH 
range for the final product is 7.2-8.2. Reconstitution with 2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP results 
in a solution containing 25 mg/mL of fludarabine phosph ate intended for intravenous  administration.

FLUDAR A FOR INJECTION is supplied in a clear glass single dose vial (6 mL capacity) and packaged 
in a single dose vial carton in a shelf pack of five. 
 
c.   Solution Preparation: FLUDAR A shou ld be prepared for parenteral use by aseptically adding Sterile 
Water for Injection USP. When  reconstituted with 2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the solid 
cake should fully dissolve in 15 seconds or less; each mL of the resulting so lution will contain 25 mg of 
fludarabine phosp hate, 25 mg of mannitol, and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH to 7.7. The pH range

5.6.5.  The CliniMACS PBS/EDTA Buffer 
 
The CliniMACS PBS/EDTA Buffer is an isotonic and isohydric buffer solution with a pH-value of 7.2 
and o smolarity of 290 mosmol/L.   Its formulation is shown in the following table. 
 
Table 1.  For mulations of the Cl iniMACS PBS/EDTA Buffer 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  CliniMACS  PBS/EDTA  Buffer  is  used  as  external  wash  and  transport  fluid  for  the  in  vitro 
preparation of human heterogeneous  cell pop ulations intended to be separated with the CliniMACS Cell 
Selection System.  This is achieved by  the following procedure: 
 
Monon uclear cells for separation are collected. After incub ating the cells with CD34 Reagent in 
PBS/EDTA Buffer the excess of unbou nd reagent is removed by  washing with the PBS/EDTA Buffer. 
Prior to and during incubation of  the antiCD34 beads with the mobilized PBSC, intravenous 
gammaglobulin is added to the incubation fluid at a concentration of 1.5 mg IVIG/ml. 
 
During the following au tomated selection, using P BS/EDTA Buffer supplemented with 0.5 %  human 
serum a lbumin (HSA), the unwanted cells are removed and, in the final step, the selected cells are eluted 
from the column by the means of the PBS/EDTA Buffer. The HSA is not a component  of the buffer and 
shou ld be supplied by the clinical site. 
 
5.6.6.        Principles of Operation 
5.6.6.1.1.           The function of the CliniMACS System with the CliniMACS CD34 reagent is to select 
CD34+ cells from he terogeneous  cell populations.   The detailed procedures are provided in the 
CliniMACS User Manual that accompanies the CliniMACS Instrument.  The selection process involves 
two phases; cell labeling prior to selection (phase 1) and the automated cell selection process (phase 2). 
Provided below is a brief summary of the procedure. 
 
5.6.6.1.2.           Phase  1 – Labeling. This phase is referred to as the cell-labeling step.  This step involves 
combining the antibody  reagent with the cellular harvest from the donor  or patient.  The antibody reagent 
is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the heterogeneous cell population during which the 
antibody  selectively binds to cells expressing the CD34 antigen.  The mixture is then washed twice in 
PBS/EDTA separation buffer.  Following centrifugation, the resulting cell pellet is resuspended  in the 
separation buffer and the labeled product is ready for cell selection. 
 
 
 
5.6.6.1.3.    Phase  2 – Cell Selection. The labeled cell product is attached to the sterile tubing set of the 
CliniMACS system.  Following a series of automated priming steps‚ the cell product is passed through a 
blood filter to remove any  cell aggregates that may be present. The cell suspension is then p assed through 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Can cer Center

the  first  column,  which  serves  as  a  pre-column  separation  step  to  eliminate  cells  that  bind  non- 
specifically.  The labeled product then passes through the second co lumn pos itioned within the magnetic 
field.  The CD34+ cells‚ to which the antibody reagent has been boun d‚ are selected and retained in the 
column matrix.  All other cells flow through the column and are collected in the negative fraction bag. 
After automated buffer washes of the column con taining the isolated CD34+ c ells‚ the co lumn is removed 
from the magnetic field‚ and the CD34+ cells are eluted into a positive fraction bag.  The selected cells 
can be used immediately after analysis or cryopreserved for later infusion into the patient.  The device is 
non-invasive in all aspects that involve processing of the cellular harvest and is not connected to the 
patient at any time.

8.2.      Pretransplant Eval uation of the Donor  
 
Family Donor 
 
Any con senting he althy family donor  who is HLA compatible with the recipient will be given highest 
priority as a potential donor for PBSC or marrow transplant as a standard of care or per other study. A 
prospective HLA-non-identical related donor must be at least genotypically HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 
haploidentical to the patient, but can differ for 1-4 HLA alleles on the unshared haplotype. Selection of 
the histocompatible donor will be based on high resolution typings of HLA A, B, C and DRB 1 loci to be 
carried out on the recipient, and h is/her siblings, parents or other family members. 
 
The donor must also provide signed informed consent to receive a 4-6 day course of G-CSF, and to 
unde rgo 1-3 leukaphereses. 
 
In preparation for the stem cell donation, the donor will provide informed consent and then undergo a 
detailed medical history and physical examination. Clinical studies may include: 
-     DEB testing (for first degree related donors) to be performed. 
-     Full hemogram

Busulfan 
As of April 2012, patient accrual is nearly complete. As a result, after the completion of  the planned 25 
patient study, we have amended the protocol to accrue at most an additional 20 patients in order to 
gain clinical experience using alternative levels of Busulfan. Previously, patients were treated with 
0.8-1.0 mg/kg of Busulfan. 
 
Of the 25 patients previous ly treated on this protocol,  at doses  of 0.8-1.0 mg/Kg of busulfan, 
12  patients  had  adequate  busulf an  levels,  and  TEN  patients  had  HIGH  busulf an  levels 
requiring a dose reduction, with no patients with low levels requiring an increase in the dose. 
 
Toxicity includ ed: oral mucositis  – grade 3 for 10 patients and grade 4 for one patient.  Five 
patients had hyperbilir ubinemia;  seven patients had transaminit is and one p atient veno- 
occlusive disease. One patient developed  renal failure. Two patients developed pul monary 
hemorrhage and one  patient dev eloped  a gastroin testinal hemo rrhage. 
Based on  this data, in this continuation study, the first 10 ad ditional patients will be treated at 0.6-0.8 
mg/kg of Busulfan. If no primary graft failures are observed in these 10 patients, then a  second cohort 
of 10 patients will be treated at 0.4-0.6 mg/kg. 
 
If however, at any time during this accrual a graft failure is observed, then the Bu sulfan dose will be 
modified and a final cohort of patients will be treated at the initial dose of 0.8-1.0 mg/kg.

Although no graft failure has been seen w ith the dose of .6-.8 mg/kg of Busulfan, it was decided to 
enroll the remainder of the patients at this cohort, as a precautionary measure and  in order to maintain 
the safety and effectiveness of the condition regimen.  Some patients have had so me evidence of mixed 
chimerism, and we  therefore do n ot see any  benefit in reducing the Bus ulfan dose any further. 
 
- Busulfan pharmacokinetics will be done and dose adjustments will be made according 
to “institutional”  standard clinical practice as indicated.  The optimal desired steady 
state CSS target sho uld be 300-350. 
 
Research particip ants wi ll have  busulf an levels drawn whenever possible  after the first dose 
on day 1, with adjustments in dosing  based on the  pharmacokineti cs of the first dose 
according to institutional st andard practice as ind icated. The doses administe red on d ays -7 
and -6 should be  adjusted if patient is > 125%  ideal body weight and should  be calculated on 
adjusted ide al body weight per  MSKCC  stand ard of care guidelines. Once pharmacokinetics 
are available, subs equent dosing  will be adjusted as per  pharmacokinetics.  
 
-      Levetiracetam or other antiseizure medications may be administered for seizure prophylaxis with 
Busulfan from day –8 until day -4 
 
 
 
-     Patients should not receive any acetaminophen or azoles during busulfan ad ministration. 
 
Cyclophosph amide 
Cyclophosph amide 10 mg/kg is to be given as an approximately 1-2 hour infusion for 4 days for a total 
dose of 40 mg/kg.  Strict attention should be made to vigorous hydration, fluid balance and maintenance 
of good urine output. Mesna may be given per institutional practice. The dose will be adjusted according 
to patients ideal body  weight for obese patients. 
 
Fludarabine 
Fludarabine 35 mg/m2 will be given IV over approximately 30 minutes daily for 4 days for a total dose of 
140 mg/m2. The dose will be adjusted according to renal function according to Institutional guidelines.

Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day intravenously approximately every 12 hours will be given on days -5, - 
4,  -3,  and  -2  immediately  prior  to  the  infusion  of  antithymocyte  globulin.  It  will  be  discontinued 
thereafter. Methylprednisolone will be given with the infusion of ATG as per institutional guidelines, and 
will be discontinued after the co mpletion of the ATG infusion. 
 
Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin) 2.5 mg/kg will be given once daily on days -5, -4, -3 and 
-2. Premedication will include the use of methylprednisolone (as defined above). In the event of a severe 
reaction to antithymocyte globulin, further doses of the agent will not be administered.   In this event, 
Equine  antithymocyte globulin (ATGAM, Upjohn) 15 mg/kg IV once daily can be substituted for each 
remaining day of ATG on the schema. In the event of reaction to ATGAM, Alemtuzumab (Campath 1H)

GVHD Prophy laxis 
 
 Cyclospo rine- Patients will receive cyclosporin A (CSA) as GVHD prophylaxis. CSA therapy will begin 
on day -3 with a taper commencing on day +100,  to be completed by day +180  unless the patient 
develops  graft-versus-host  disease.    F or  adults  with  no rmal  baseline  renal  function (creatinine <1.2 
mg/dL), the initial CSA dose is recommended  to be 2.5 mg/kg IV approximately over 2 hours every 12 
hours; for children <40 kg, the initial dose  is recommended  to be 2.5 mg/kg IV  approximately over 2 
hours every 8 hours. Initial and subsequent doses of CSA may be  adjusted and administered as per 
institutional guidelines. Trough levels will be ob tained, and doses will be adjusted according to each 
Center’s standard of care guidelines. 
 
Additional GVHD Proph ylaxis will be administered to patients as per guidelines outlined in Table 
9.3.2.2, Guidelines for achieving target allograft cell doses.

Related Donors  
Following screening and enrollment, the donor will receive mobilization therapy with G-CSF as per each 
institution’s guidelines. 
 
Unrelated Donors 
For Unrelated donors, G-CSF will be administered and the leukaphereses obtained according to the 
National Marrow Donor Program p rotocol and IND. Monon uclear cell fractions collected on the fifth and 
sixth days will be pooled. CD34+ progenitor cells in the mononuc lear cell rich leukapheresis cell fraction 
will be positively selected. 
 
9.3.2.  Progenitor Cell Colle ction a nd Processing 
 
9.3.2.1 L eukapheresis – for Related Donors  
Leukapheresis will be performed on a continuous  flow cell separator according to Institutional standards 
and will commence on the morning of the 5th  day of G-CSF treatment. The anti-coagulant used for the 
procedure will be acid citrate dextrose (ACD ). No additional anti-coagulants or additives (heparin etc.) 
shou ld be added be yond those normally used during leukapheresis. The volume of blood processed per 
leukapheresis session sho uld be approximately 3-4 times the total blood volume as tolerated by the donor. 
A  unique  identification  and  labeling  s ystem  shall  be  used  to  track  the  leukapheresis  product  from 
collection to infusion  as per each institution’s guidelines. 
 
The target allograft cell doses following processing on  the CliniMACS device are a CD34+ cell dose of > 
5.0 x 106 cells/Kg recipient weight with a maximum CD3+ cell dose of < 5.0 x 104 cells/Kg of recipient 
weight. A minimum CD34+ cell dose of 2.5 x 106  cells/Kg will be targeted. If this minimum target 
CD34+ cell dose is not achieved after 2 leukaphereses, a third leukapheresis may be planned after 
discussion with the principal investigator of the Institution. 
 
This protocol requires an absolute minimum CD34+ cell dose of 2.0 x 106  cells/Kg in order to be 
evaluable for all study en dpoints. If the post CD34+ s election allograft content is < 2.0 x 1 06 CD34+ 
cells/Kg after 2 leukapheresis procedures, the Transplant Center should perform a third leukapheresis 
collection without CD34+ s election in order to ensure that an adeq uate CD34+ cell dose is transplanted. 
Since this graft will contain a high number of CD3+ cells, such patients must also receive the addition of 
pharmacologic GvHD prophylaxis per Institutional standards. 
 
During mobilization and leukaph eresis, Institutional Standards for donor supportive care should be 
maintained. 
 
9.3.2.2. C D34+Selection with the CliniMACS D evice – Related or Unrelated Donors  
 
CD34+ cell selection will be performed according to procedures given in the CliniMACS Users Operating 
Manual and institutional Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in place and validated at the study sites. 
 
Produ cts will be received into the cell processing laboratories and  will be either processed that day, or 
stored overnight.  Products stored overnight must be processed the following day. At receipt the  product

will be accessioned and assigned a unique product identifier if not already assigned during collection. 
The product will be inspected at the time of receipt and the label information regarding don or name, 
medical record number (or other identifier) and ABO and Rh group will be compared for consistency to 
the information in the laboratory chart record and physicians order form. 
 
The product will be sampled for total nucleated cell count (TNC), and if processing is to be pe rformed on 
the day of receipt, additional sample will be obtained for starting CD34+ cell and starting T  cell content 
and product sterility.  Products may be stored overnight for one of two reasons, 1) late arrival preventing 
selection and infusion the same day, or 2) low TNC content that would permit pooling of  two collections 
for a single column selection.  If the product is to be stored overnight, the cells will be diluted to < 2.0 x 
108   cells/mL  using  either  autologous  plasma  or  the  CliniMACS  PBS/EDTA-1.0%  Human  Serum 
Albumin  (HSA) (CliniMACS  bu ffer)  and  stored in a  monitored refrigerator at  either 6oC or 2-8oC 
depen ding upon the institutional policy.  Products that are stored overnight will be sampled the following 
day, prior to processing, for TNC, starting CD34+ c ell and starting T cell content, and for sterility. 
 
Cell processing personnel will receive training by Miltenyi on the CliniMACS system prior to initiation 
of clinical product selection. The site will provide docu mentation to Miltenyi on competency in the 
processing procedures including the results of validation runs on the CliniMACS System. 
 
Analysis of allograft 
Samples will be taken from each leukapheresis product pre- and po st-CD34+ selection and 
characterized as  follows: 
• Graft Evaluation (all of these tests are standard of care) 
 Gram stain (done locally) post-selection on each leukapheresis product 
 Total nucleated cell count (done locally) pre- and post-selection on each leukapheresis 
product 
 Endoto xin testing pos t-selection on each leukapheresis produc t, done locally or sent to an 
authorized lab 
 Flow  cytometric analysis for CD34+  cells pre- and post-selection done locally using 
validated SOPs 
 Flow c ytometric analysis for CD3+ cells pre- and post-selection and log depletion on each  
leukapheresis product done locally using validated SOPs 
 Viability testing (trypan blue dye exc lusion assay) post-selection 
 14 day  sterility cultures post-selection on each leukapheresis product 
 
• Criteria for release of product 
 Viability 70% after selection 
 Negative gram stain 
 CD34+ cell count of product 
 
As noted above, the target optimal allograft cell doses following processing on the CliniMACS 
device  include both a CD34+ cell count  of  > 5.0 x 106/kg recipient weight and a CD3+ cell dose 
of < 5.0 x 104/kg recipient weight.   The targeted minimum CD34+  cell dose following CD34+ 
selection is 2.5 x 106/kg. If after two leukapheresis collections followed by CD34+  selection the 
total allograft contains 2.5-5.0 x106 CD34+ cells/kg and < 5.0 x104 CD3+ cells/kg, a total of three 
leukapheresis collections followed by CD34+ selection are allowed as long as the total CD3+ cell 
dose transplanted does not exceed 5.0 x 104/kg.  That is, a graft containing 2.5-5.0x106  CD34+

cells/kg and < 5.0 x104  CD3+  cells/kg is acceptable whereas a graft containing 5.0x1 06  CD34+ 
cells/kg but > 5.0 x104 CD3+ cells/kg is not.  A major goal is to administer a CD34+ cell dose > 
5.0x106/kg while limiting the CD3+  cell dose to < 5.0 x104  but as long as a minimum of 2.0 
x106/kg CD34+ cells are infused, the CD3+ cell dose should be kept to < 5.0 x104 /kg.  It may be 
possible to give only a proportion of the CD34+ selected product in order to maintain an adequate 
CD34+ cell dose while limiting the CD3+ cell dose to < 5.0 x1 04 /kg. 
 
It is also possible that doses of CD34+ cells far exceeding 5.0 x 106/kg can  be given without 
exceeding the maximum T cell dose of 5.0 x104  CD3+  cells/kg.  High doses of CD34+  cells in 
extensively T cell depleted transplants are postulated to hasten immune reconstitution, without 
altering the low risk of  GVHD. Consequently, there is no upper limit for the dose of CD34+ 
cells/kg as long as the dose of CD3+ cells does not exceed 5.0 x104 /kg. Furthermore, a minimum 
of 2 leukaphereses should be obtained from each donor even if the first leukapheresis provides 
5.0 x 106  CD34+  cells/kg, if the anticipated cumulative CD3+  cell dose is expected to be < 5.0 
x104 /kg of recipient weight. 
 
Decisions concerning the release of samples from the CD34+ selected product will be ba sed on   CD34+ 
and CD3+ cell analysis done by the flow cytometry laboratory at the site.  The attached table outlines the 
various scenarios that may be en countered after each CD34+ c ell selection and indicates appropriate 
steps for achieving target allograft cell doses.

this number refers to total pooled CD34+ and CD3+ cell doses following all CD34+ selections 
2. If unsuccessful in reducing CD3+ cell dose to < 5.0 x 104  cells/Kg  at any CD34+ cell dose, hold allograft overnight 
and proceed to leukapheresis #2. If leukapheresis #2 results in a post selection CD34+ cell count of > 2.0 x 10 6 cells/Kg with 
CD3+ cell dose of < 5.0 x104 cells/Kg, give that allograft, proceed to leukapheresis #3 and discard or cryopreserved graft from 
leukapheresis #1. The primary goal is to reduce the total CD3+ cell dose to < 5.0 x 104  cells/Kg while maintaining the total 
CD34+ cell dose to > 2.0 x 106 cells/Kg.

Patients will undergo physical examinations daily until discharge with particular attention to assessments 
of potential toxicities induced by preparatory cytoreductive therapy, including mucositis, cystitis, sepsis, 
pneu monia,  veno-occlusive  disease  (VOD)  and  transplant-associated  complications  including  graft 
failure, acute and chronic GvHD, and transplant associated infections.  Patients are closely monitored for 
alterations in vital signs, weight, oral and intravenous  intake, and intestinal and urinary output. Cardiac 
assessments are obtained prior to admission to assess cardiac function and thereafter when clinically 
indicated. Pulmonary status is closely monitored when c linically indicated by radiographic and functional 
analysis. Ba seline physical examinations and any  subsequent abnormal new findings will be recorded. 
Following discharge, ph ysical examination, will be performed at least every 2-4 weeks or as clinically 
indicated.

mitogens, and to viruses, and immunoglobulin levels and a ntibody responses. 
 
11.0     TOXICITI ES/SIDE EFFECTS  
Patients recruited to this transplantation trial are individuals who are either referred by physicians or self- 
referred for marrow transplantation as  a potentially cu rative treatment for their malignanc y. Prior to 
consideration for transplant, all patients undergo a series of 1-3 hour consultations discussing the risks 
and potential benefits of an allogeneic marrow transplant and the different procedures which will be a 
normal part of the transplant course. The risks and potential benefits of the transplant procedure, as well 
as the participation in any given research, experimental, or therapeutic protocol are also discussed. All 
patients entered into our studies provide written informed consent. In the case of minors, consent of the 
parent or guardian and assent of the child are obtained. All protocols and consent forms are reviewed and 
approved by  the Institutional Review Board. 
 
The potential risks of an allogeneic transplant from an  HLA-compatible unrelated donor or HLA- 
mismatched  related donor  are significant. These risks along with approaches to circumvent or mini mize 
their effects on the health and well being of the patient can be  summarized as  follows.

Infections and he morrhage cons titute major and con tinuing risks throughout the period of marrow aplasia. 
These are, however, also the major risks associated with the primary disease. Certain oppo rtunistic 
infections remain a risk in bone  marrow transplant recipients beyond recovery of circulating leukocytes, 
for at least 9-12 months po st-transplant, e.g. Pneu mocystis carinii and cytomegalovirus. 
 
The above risks are carefully considered both by the ph ysicians and by  the pa tients prior to admission to a 
study protocol. The patients who are being considered for allogeneic peripheral blood stem ce ll 
transplantation a re afflicted with Fanconi anemia and aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or 
leukemias which are lethal diseases for whom a  hematopoietic stem cell transplant from a  an HLA- 
compatible unrelated donor or HLA-mismatched related donor currently con stitutes the only curative 
option in the treatment of this disease. In the protocol proposed, use is made of an  experimental device 
produced by Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA. This device is approved for experimental applications under 
an IDE from the Food and  Drug Administration. 
 
All patients undergoing cytoreduction in the protocol will be treated with busulfan, cyclophosphamide 
and fludarabine.  They will also receive anti-human thymocyte globulin to prevent graft rejection. All of 
the treatments as well as other drugs used before and during the transplant may produce  side effects. 
These risks are listed below. 
 
a.          Busulfan 
- Myelosuppression, complete ablation is expected. 
- Gastrointestinal: nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea 
- Alopec ia 
- Mucositis 
- Seizures: generally preventable by phen ytoin therapy or other antiseizure medications such as Keppra, 
started 24 h ours prior to administration and continued for 24 hours post busulfan 
- Abnormal liver function 
- Pulmonary fibrosis 
- Gonadal dysfunction 
- Hyperpigment ation 
 
 
 
 
b.          Cyclophosph amide 
- Bone marrow suppression, complete bone marrow ablation is expected. 
- Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, ano rexia, diarrhea, stomatitis, esophagitis, colitis 
- Alopec ia 
- Fever 
- Serious h ypersensitivity reactions: Edema, rash, anaphylaxis 
- Water retention: inappropriate secretion of ADH , usually manifested 4-8 hou rs after IV administration 
- Cardiomyopathy:  Cyclophosph amide may cause  a severe, sometimes lethal cardiomyopathy. 
- Hemorrhagic cystitis:  serious complication related to the interaction of cyclophosphamide metabolites 
- Skin rash: This may develop 1-3 days post infusion and sub sides thereafter. 
- Hemolytic ane mia 
- Sterility: This is a likely complication after puberty. Risk may be reduced in young  children. 
- Late effects:   Late effects may occur  with varying degree following cyclophos phamide and include

growth failure, gonadal failure and sterility, hypothyroidism, and secondary malignanc ies. 
 
c.          Fludara bine 
- Nausea, vomiting 
- Mouth sores, stomach c ramps and diarrhea, 
- Jaund ice, and elevations of liver enzymes. 
- Scaling and redness of the skin, which is usually of short duration. 
- Effects on the nervous system are not usually seen at the fludarabine dose used in this protocol, but, 
when they occur, can include c erebellar dysfunction with loss of balance and trouble walking. 
 
d.           Methylprednisolone 
- Increased risk of infection 
- Increased blood pressure 
- Stomach ups et including ulcers. Prophylaxis (such as antacids) will be administered as protection. 
- Hyperlipidemia 
- Hypergylcemia 
 
e.          Anti-Thymocyte Globulin 
- ATG is a rabbit protein which may induce  an immune response in humans. Prior exposure to rabbit 
proteins  may  predispose  to  serious  allergic  reactions  such  as  anaphylaxis,  generalized  urticaria,  or 
bronchospasm. This risk remains significant. Such reactions will be treated with epinephrine and anti- 
histamines. In the event of a severe systemic allergic reaction, a  trial of an alternative equine ATG will be 
administered. If a similar reaction occurs with the equine ATG, no further ATG will be administered. 
 
- Serum sickness - approximately 10-30% of patients treated with rabbit ATG will develop a late immune 
reaction to the globulin resulting in serum s ickness 3-10 days after administration. This is manifested by 
fever, rash, and arthralgias. Renal toxicity is rare. Prednisone for one week at  1 mg/kg has  been shown  to 
be effective therapy. 
 
- Fever and chills - are managed by antipyretics and meperidine but are usually only severe after first 
dose. 
 
- Leukopen ia/thrombocytopen ia - ATG may also cause further decrease in leukocyte and platelet counts 
which w ill be managed by  transfusion therapy. 
 
f.    Cyclosporine 
• Renal dysfunction 
• Increased blood pressure 
• Hirsutism 
• Neurological side effects: Tremor (common), seizures (rare), ataxia, cortical blindness (rare), and 
peripheral neuropathies. 
• Liver toxicity 
• Hyperkalemia or hypokalemia 
• Low serum magnesium 
• Gastrointestinal complaints including anorexia, nausea, and ileus 
• Gingival hyperplasia 
• Skin pigmentation changes 
• Depression

h.  Pneumocystis carinii proph ylaxis 
The risk of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in the dos es given are primarily hypersensitivity reactions 
and signs of folate deficiency. Any pa tient with known hypersensitivity to these compounds  will not 
receive these drugs. The risks of parenteral pentamidine are primarily hypotension and hypoglycemia 
both of which will be monitored during and following administration of the drug. Hypokalemia or 
hypomagnesemia  associated  with  prolonged  QT  syndrome  or  Torsade  de  pointe  necessitates  strict 
electrolyte monitoring. The risks of aerosolized pentamidine are mild bronchospasm primarily observed 
in (prior) tobacco abusers and ea sily managed wi th bronchod ilator therapy. 
 
i. Malignancies 
a. Pa tients transplanted for leukemia are at significant risk of recurrence of their original disease. 
 
b. Pa tients receiving T-cell depleted marrow grafts with ATG are at significant risk of developing an EBV 
lymphop roliferative disease. For p atients treated with horse ATG, this risk is approximately 10-15%. 
However, for those treated with rabbit ATG, it is less than 4%. This complication might be prevented 
with Acyclovir prophylaxis and may be treatable by infusions of peripheral blood leukocytes from the 
marrow dono r. 
 
c. Seco ndary malignanc ies - there is a possibility that second ary malignanc ies may de velop. The age- 
adjusted incidence of secondary cancers in transplant patients after radiation and chemotherapy has 
recently been estimated to be 6.7  times higher than that of first cancers in the general population. Most of 
these were non -Hodgkin's lymphomas. 
 
j. Graft Failures 
The risk of rejection of a T-cell depleted related, HLA-disparate marrow and peripheral blood progenitor 
graft may be 20% or greater. Patients rejecting their grafts may receive a secondary transplant from the 
same or an alternative donor, or may receive a reinfusion of autologous cryopreserved marrow whenever 
available. 
 
k. Graft Versus Host Disease 
Acute GvHD is manifested by s kin rash; hepatitis; ulceration of  the surfaces of the oral cavity, esophagus, 
and intestines; and suppressed or delayed recovery of the hematopoietic and immune system. In patients 
transplanted and engrafted with SBA-E- T-cell depleted marrow from HLA 1-3 allele disparate related 
dono rs, this complication has been observed in fewer than 20% of patients and has rarely been severe. It 
may be fatal in at least 20-50% of cases and may also predispose to lethal infections which contribute to 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Can cer Center 
IRB Prot ocol 
IRB#: 08-031 A(10) 
Amended:  06/18 /14 
- 30 -  
  
 
 
an additional mortality of 10-25%. Severe acute GvHD will be treated with intense immunosupp ressive 
therapy according to standard clinical practice or other experimental protocol. 
 
Approximately 50% of patients with acute GvHD may also develop chronic GvHD, manifested to varying 
degrees by scleroderma-like changes of the skin, cirrhosis of the liver, sclerosis of lacrimal and salivary 
ducts, chronic inflammation and s carring of  the gastrointestinal tract with con sequent  malabsorption and 
diarrhea, chronic bronchitis, and suppression of the immune system. This can be treated with standard or 
protocol-based experimental immunosupp ression, but may be refractory. 
 
l. Blood p roduct infusions 
The volume of the T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cells infused is approximately 30-50 cc. They 
may induce  allergic reactions. Small, subclinical pulmonary emboli may occu r, but these rarely if ever 
require any intervention. S tandard pre-medications for blood products may be  used before administration 
of the marrow graft. 
 
Infusions of  fractionated blood p roducts may produce  volume overload, which can be managed wi th 
diuretics. They  may also induce allergic reactions of variable severity, many of which can be prevented or 
mitigated by  premedication with antipyretics, antihistamines, and n arcotics. These products may also 
serve as vectors of serious infection (e.g., CMV, hepatitis, AIDS). To circumvent this, prospective blood 
and marrow donors will be screened  as  per each institution’s guidelines. CMV antibody (-) blood 
products will be used in CMV (-) individuals, whenever possible, regardless of the antibody  status of the 
marrow dono r. ALL blood products are irradiated (3000r, 137Cs) to circumvent the risk of GvHD caused 
by contaminating lymphoc ytes in the transfused fractions. 
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR TH ERAPEUTIC RE SPONSE/OUTCO ME AS SESSMENT  
 
Definition of events in the post-transplant course important for analysis and  treatment 
 
 
12.1.     Graft Failure or Rejection 
Graft failure or rejection will be the primary endpo int of this study. 
Primary non-engraftment is diagnosed when the patient fails to achieve an ANC 500/l at any time in 
the first 28 days post-transplant. If (1) after achievement of an ANC 500/mm3, the ANC declines to 
<500 /mm3  for more than 3 consecutive days in the absence of relapse, or, (2) there is absence of donor 
cells in the marrow and/or blood as demonstrated by chimerism assay in the absence of relapse, a 
diagnosis  of  secondary  graft  failure  is  made.  If,  however,  recurrence  of  host  MDS  is  detected 
conc urrently, the patient is not  evaluable for graft failure or rejection. Patients with evidence of graft 
failure without evidence of recurrence of host MDS  will have additional studies drawn to ascertain cause 
and d efine relevant histoincompatibilities. 
 
These analyses may include (1) Evaluation  of  bone  marrow  aspirates  and  biopsies  for  residual  or 
recurrent MDS/AML, when indicated, and (2) Culture and /or molecular analyses of marrow and/or blood 
for viral pathogens potentially causing graft failure including CMV, HHV6 and p arvovirus B 19.  
 
Patients who suffer graft failure will be considered for a secondary transplant. The need for additional 
immunosupp ression or treatment for viral infection prior to the secondary transplant will be determined 
by the results obtained from chimerism and viral studies. We have performed second ary transplants for 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Can cer Center 
IRB Prot ocol

patients with graft failure and have published our experience on  rescuing patients with graft failure with 
fludarabine based regimens – including one patient with Fanconi anemia (Chewning JH, et al. 
Fludarabine-based conditioning secures engraftm ent of second hematopoietic  stem cell allografts 
in the treatment of init ial graft failure.  Biol Blood Marrow Transp lant. 13(11):1313-23; 2007) 
 
 
12.2.     Early post-transplant severe morbidity and  mortality 
The occurrence of severe post transplant regimen-related severe morbidity (grade IV toxicity) and/or 
mortality will be the second endpoint of this study. In the con text of the agents or agent-combination used 
for cytoreduction used, particular attention will be given to toxicity involving (1) the liver, (2) the lungs, 
(3) the  oral  mucosa and gastrointestinal tract,  and (4) the  central  nervous system.  The  grading for 
monitoring the morbidity and mortality will be based on the NCI/CTEP common toxicity criteria version 
3.0. 
 
 
 
12.3.     Graft Versus Host Disease 
 
Patients will be observed for acute and/or chronic GvHD. Standard clinical criteria for the grading of 
acute and  chronic GvHD will be done according to IBMTR guidelines See  Appendices 3 and 4. 
 
To determine the severity of acute GvHD, data  may be collected approximately weekly to characterize 
the severity of symptoms and signs caused by GvHD and to evaluate possible confounding factors. Real 
time data collection of GvHD will include grades for each organ involved and o verall grade. 
 
Patients with moderate to severe acute GvHD (grade II-IV)  will be treated with immunosuppr essive 
therapy according to standard clinical practice or other experimental protocol. 
 
Treatment of chronic GvHD will consist of corticosteroids, and other agents or modalities, according to 
Institutional standard of care guidelines and protocols. 
 
12.4.     Leuke mic Relapse 
 
For patients with MDS or  AML, relapse will be analyzed as to type and genetic origin of the 
MDS/leukemic cells. These will be de fined by an increasing nu mber of blasts in the marrow over 5%, by 
the presence of circulating pe ripheral blasts, or by the presence of blasts in any ex tramedullary site. 
Cytogenetic analysis of the marrow and/or peripheral blood will also be  obtained for the diagnosis of 
relapse. 
 
12.5.     Secondary  malignancies 
Patients will be followed indefinitely through annual contact with their treatment  center in order to 
track the risk of developing a seconda ry malignancy.  
 
 
 
13.0      CRITERIA FOR REMOVA L FROM STUD Y 
 
Patients may be removed from the study at any point deemed appropriate by the principle investigator. 
However, once the busulfan is given, patients will continue on study until after administration of the stem

cells.  Failure to rescue the patient with stem ce lls at this point in the cytoreduction would most likely be 
fatal. 
 
 
 
14.0     BIO STAT ISTICS  
 
This phase II trial is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy  of hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation for the treatment of patients with Fanconi Anemia lacking a genetically identical donor. A 
maximum of  25 patients will be accrued onto the study. It is anticipated that the accrual will last 3 years, 
and w ill include patients from 6 different centers. 
 
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the incidence of engraftment, graft versus host disease, 
and treatment related morbidity and  mortality (treatment related morbidity will be assessed through the 
incidence of grade 1 to 3 toxicity). At the conclusion of the study, the probability of each these events will 
be computed along with their attendant 95% confidence interval. In addition, Kaplan-Meier estimates of 
overall and disease free survival will be computed over time for the entire cohort and by disease (AA and 
early MDS  / advanced MDS and AM L). 
 
In order to reduce patient risk, the study de sign includes early termination in the event of excessive graft 
failure, graft versus host disease, or  early treatment related mortality du ring the accrual period.  The 
stopping rules are provided in the table below and consider only the marginal failure probabilities.

As of April 2012, patient accrual is nearly complete in the HSCT Fanconi Anemia study. As a result, after 
the completion of the planned 25 p atient study, we have amended the protocol to accrue at most an 
additional 20 patients in order to gain clinical experience using alternative levels of Busulfan. Pr eviously, 
patients were treated with 0.8-1.0 mg/kg of Busulfan. In this continuation study, 10 pa tients will be 
treated at 0.6-0.8 mg/kg of Busulfan. If no primary graft failures are observed in these 10 patients, then a 
further cohort of 10 patients will be treated at 0.4-0.6 mg/kg. If however, at any time during this accrual a

IRB Prot ocol

graft failure is observed, then the Bus ulfan dose will be modified and a final cohort of patients will be 
treated at the initial dose of 0.8-1.0 mg/kg. If no graft failures are observed in 10 patients at a given do se 
level, then we  are confident that the probability of graft failure in this population is less than 0.2 0. 
In add ition to monitoring for graft failure, the stopping rules below will be used to monitor the additional 
20 pa tients for acute GvHD and treatment related mortality.

mortality 3 in the first 9 patients  
4 in the first 14 patients  
5 within  20 patients  0.10 0.09 
0.40 0.96 
 
 
Although no graft failure has been seen w ith the dose of .6-.8 mg/kg of Busulfan, it was decided to enroll 
the remainder of the patients at this cohort, as a precautionary measure and  in order to maintain the safety 
and effectiveness  of the condition regimen. These patients have had so me evidence of mixed c himerism, 
and we therefore do not  see any benefit in reducing the Busulfan dose any further.

16.1.1 Data Man agement at MSKCC 
 
A Research Study Assistant (RSA) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, will be assigned 
to the study. The responsibilities of the RSA include project compliance, da ta co llection, 
abstraction and entry, data reporting regulatory monitoring, problems and prioritization. 
 
MSKCC will be the data collection site for all 5 sites. 
Data collection forms will be drafted in a standard format and will be provided to ea ch 
participating institution by MSKCC.   Case Report Forms (paper) will be submitted with the 
protocol.    Completed  data  collection  forms  will  be  submitted  to  Memorial  Sloan-Kettering 
Cancer  Center on a wee kly basis. 
 
The data collected for this study will be en tered into a secure database by the MSKCC RSA. Data 
will be collected, s tored, and monitored at an institutional level via the Clinical Record Database 
(CRD B version 3.3) system. 
 
Source docu mentation will be available to supp ort the co mputerized patient record. Variables that 
will be recorded include the patient's birth date, date of diagnosis, date of study entry and 
histologic diagnosis. The results of the pretreatment and end of therapy evaluations, including the 
extent of disease evaluation (history, physical examination and  imaging studies), baseline 
laboratory values, renal and hepatic function, will be recorded. The presence of toxicity during 
and after administration of the transplant will be monitored and recorded by each  institution. On 
this study, we will be capturing and tracking Grade 3-4 toxicities which occur within 30 days 
following  a  transplant  and  are  potentially  attributable  to  treatment  on  study.  Hematologic 
toxicities which are attributable to und erlying hematologic disease will not be tracked. The results 
of the extent of disease evaluation (history, physical examination and imaging studies) following 
each course of treatment will be collected by the participating institutions and recorded. The 
patient's disease status and last follow-up will be collected by the participating institutions and 
recorded. If disease progresses or recurs, the results of the repeat extent of disease evaluation will 
be collected by the participating institutions and recorded. Any second ary malignancy a rising in 
any organ will also need to be captured in database. Data collected for secondary malignanc ies at 
annu al visits will include: (1) site, (2) pathology, (3) grade, (4) treatment and (5) outcome. 
 
Standard baseline information will also be collected for dono rs. 
 
The protocol will be conducted as a single research study effort and data from each  participating 
institution will be included in the analysis of results. 
 
16.2     Q uality Assurance 
 
Registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accruals and completeness of registration data. 
Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data and inconsistencies.  Ac crual rates 
and e xtent and accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will be monitored periodically throughout the study 
period and potential problems will be brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and  action

Rando m-sample data quality and p rotocol compliance audits will be condu cted by the study team, at a 
minimum of  once a  year, more frequently if indicated. 
 
In Case of an FDA audit, the FDA will audit each participating site individually as each site will 
hold their own IDE. Thus each center will be responsible for having all source documents, research 
records, all IRB approval documents, Drug  Accountability Record forms, patient registration lists, 
response assessments scans, x-rays, etc. available for the au dit 
 
Response Review 
 
Patients participating on trials at MSKCC where therapeutic efficacy is a stated primary objective, 
typically phase II and III trials, are subject to review by MSKCC’s Therapeutic Response Review 
Committee (TRRC ).  In these cases, radiology, add itional lab reports and possibly bone marrow 
biopsies and/or aspirates may need to be obtained from the ou tside sites for MSKCC TRRC review 
and co nfirmation of response assessment. The se materials must be obtained within sixty days of 
request to the site. 
 
16.3 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were approved 
by the National Cancer Institute in September 2001. The p lans address the new policies set forth by the 
NCI in the document entitled “Po licy of the N ational Cancer Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of 
Clinical Trials” which can be found at:   http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index. html.   The 
DSM P lans at MSKCC were established and are monitored by  the Office of Clinical Research. The 
MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on  the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb2.ms kcc.org/irb/index.htm 
 
There are several different mechan isms by which clinical trials are monitored for data, safety and quality. 
There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol monitoring, compliance and 
data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff education on  clinical research Q A) and 
departmental procedures for quality control, plus there are two institutional committees that are 
responsible for monitoring the activities of our clinical trials programs.  The committees: Data and S afety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and  Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the Center’s Res earch Council and Institutional 
Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for it’s level of risk 
and de gree of monitoring required.  E very type of  protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, in-house  sponsored, 
industrial sponsored, N CI coope rative group, e tc.) Will be ad dressed and the monitoring procedures will 
be established at the time of protocol activation. 
 
Data from all participating sites will be monitored by the MSK DSMC on  a quarterly basis. 
 
17.0 PROTECTI ON OF  HUMAN SUBJ ECTS 
 
Risks: From  the studies that have been done so far there appears to be no increase in risk to the patients. 
However, given this is a new treatment, it is possible that there are side effects that have not yet been

17.2 Serious Adv erse Event (SAE) Reporting Guidelines for MSKCC 
 
Any SAE must be reported to the IRB/PB as soon as possible but no later than 5  calendar days. The 
IRB/PB requires a Clinical Research D atabase (CRDB ) SAE report be submitted electronically to the 
SAE Office at  sae@mskcc.org containing the following information: 
 
Fields po pulated from the CRDB : 
 Subject’s name 
 Medical record number 
 Disease/histology (if applicable) 
 Protocol number 
Data needing to be entered: 
 The date the adverse event occurred 
 The adverse event 
 Relationship of the adverse event to the treatment (drug, device, or intervention) 
 If the AE  was expected 
 The severity of the AE  
 The intervention 
 Detailed text that includes the following information: 
o An exp lanation of how the AE was handled 
o A description of the subject's condition 
o Indication if the subject remains on the study 
o If an amendment will need to be made to the protocol and/or consent form 
 
The PI’s signature and the date it was signed are required on  the completed report. 
 
For IND/IDE protocols: 
 
The CRD B AE repo rt should be completed as above and the FDA assigned IND/IDE number written at 
the top of the report. If appropriate, the report will be forwarded to the FDA by the SAE staff through the 
IND Office. 
Each p articipating center will follow their institutional guidelines in regards to SAE sub mission to the 
FDA. 
 
The MSKCC  PI is responsible for reporting all grade 3-5 unexpected, definite, probable, possib le 
related SAEs on p rotocol  to all pa rticipating  sites within 5 calendar days of receipt. 
 
All SAEs must be entered into the CRDB SAE form page. 
 
17.2.1 Serious Adve rse Event (SAE) Reporting for Participating Institutions

An SAE is an undesirable experience that meets one  of the following criteria: 
 
 Is fatal or life-threatening 
 Is disabling 
 Results in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
 Results in a congenital anomaly or occurrence of malignancy  
 Important medical event that jeopardizes the participant AND requires medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above Note: Hospital admission for a planned 
procedure/disease treatment is not considered an SAE. 
 
Attribution: 
 
 Unrelated: The AE  is clearly NOT related to the intervention 
 Unlikely: The AE  is doubtfully related to the intervention 
 Possible: The AE may be  related to the intervention 
 Prob able: The AE  is likely related to the intervention 
 Definite: The AE  is clearly related to the intervention 
 
Expec ted and Unexpected Event: 
 
 Expec ted: Any experience previously reported (in nature, severity, or incidence) in the 
current Investigator’s Brochure or general investigational plan 
 Unexpe cted: Any experience not previously reported (in nature, severity, or incidence) in the 
current Investigator’s Brochure or general investigational plan 
 
UNEX PECTED EVENT: 
 
 Grades 1-2: Adverse Event Reporting NOT required. 
 
 Grades 3: Possible, Probable or Definite attribution to the drug and/or device. 
 
 Grades 4 and 5: Regardless of Attribution. This includes all deaths within 30 days of the last dose 
of treatment with an investigational agent regardless of attribution. 
 
EXPECTED EVENT  
 
 Grades 1 – 3: Adverse Event Reporting NOT required. 
 
 Grades 4 and  5: Regardless of Attribution. This includes all deaths w ithin 30 days of the last dose 
of treatment with an investigational agent regardless of attribution.

- For skin GvHD: - Use “Rule of Nines or burn chart to determine extent of rash 
- For liver GvHD: - Range of bilirubin given as total bilirubin. 
- Downgrade one stage if an additional cause of hyperbilirubinemia is documented 
- For gut GvH D:   - Downgrade one stage if an additional cause of diarrhea is documented 
- St 1: Persistent nausea, vomiting and anorexia in the absence of other known cause 
Unless histology is negative

Clinical Manifestations of Chron ic GvHD  
 
 
Organ Clinical Manifestation Evaluation Intervention 
 
 
Skin  Erythematous papular rash (lichenoid) or 
thickened, tight, fragile skin (sclerodermatous). Clinical and biopsy to 
confirm the diagnosis of 
GVHD. Moisturize (petroleum jelly), treat 
local infections, protect from 
further trauma. Topical steroid 
ointment may be used if it gives 
symptomatic relief to localized 
areas. 
 
 
Nails Vertical ridging, fragile. damage. Clinical. Nail polish may help to decrease 
further 
 
 
Sweat glands Destruction leading to risk of hyperthermia. Avoid excessive heat. 
 
 
Hair Scalp and body hair is thin and fragile, can be 
partially or completely lost. Clinical. 
 
 
Eyes Dryness, photophobia, and burning. 
Progression to corneal abrasion. Regular ophthalmologic 
evaluation including 
Schirmer’s test. Preservative free tears during the 
day and preservative free 
ointment at night. 
 
 
Mouth Dry; sensitivity to mint, spicy food, tomato. 
Whitish lace-like plaques Avoid foods which 
are not tolerated. Regular in the cheeks and 
tongue identical to lichen planus. Erythema 
and dental care preceded by appropriate 
endocardi-painful ulcerations, mucosal Regular dental evaluation (with 
appropriate endocarditis

cultures at diagnosis and at any 
worsening. tis prophylaxis.

scleroderma with decreased sen sitivity to 
temperature can also happen. an antifungal agent for 
symptomatic relief. 
 
 
Respiratory tract  Bronchiolitis Obliterans can manifest as 
dyspnea, wheezing, cough with normal CT scan 
and marked obstruction at pulmonary function 
tests. Chronic sinopulmonary symptoms and/or 
infections are also common.With abnormal 
chest CT, must rule out infections. Lung biopsy 
if clinically indicated. Pulmonary function tests 
including FEV1, FVC, 
DLCO, helium lung 
volumes. CT scan in 
symptomatic patients. Investigational therapy. 
 
 
Gastrointestinal Abn ormal motility and strictures. Weight loss.  Swallowing studies, 
endoscopy if clinically 
indicated. Nutritional 
evaluation. intervention. Systemic treatment of GVHD; 
endoscopical/ surgical treatment 
of strictures. Nutritional 
 
 
Liver  Cholestasis (increased bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase). Isolated liver involvement needs 
histologic confirmation. Liver function tests. Liver 
biopsy if clinically 
indicated. No specific therapy is proven 
superior. FK506 may concentrate 
in the liver. 
 
 
Musculoskeletal Fasciitis. Myositis is rare. Osteoporosis may 
occur secondary to hormonal deficits, use of 
steroids, decreased activity. Periodical physical 
therapy evaluation to 
document the range of 
motion. Bone density 
evaluation especially in 
patients using steroids. Aggressive physical therapy 
program. 
 
 
Immune system 
Variable IgG 
levels. Profound immunodeficiency. Functional 
asplenia. High risk of pneumococcal sepsis, 
PCP, and invasive fungal infections. GVHD has 
resolved. Assume all patients as 
severely immuno- 
compromised and 
asplenic to 6 months after 
vaccinations. PCP prophylaxis (until 6 months 
after no GVHD) and 
Pneu mococcal prophylaxis 
(lifetime). Delay 
 
 
Hematopoietic 
system Cytopenias. Occasional eosinophilia.  Counts. Bone marrow 
aspirate and biopsy, anti- 
neutrophil and anti- 
platelet antibodies when 
indicated. Systemic treatment of GVHD. 
 
 
Others  Virtually all autoimmune disease 
manifestations have been described in 
association with chronic GVHD. As clinically indicated.

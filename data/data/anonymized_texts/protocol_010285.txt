Dr. Kremer and/or her research team will explain this study to you.  Medical research studies include only people who choose to take part. Take your time to make your decision about participating. You may discuss your decision with your family and friends and with your health care team. If you have any questions, you may ask your study doctor.   You are being asked to take part in this study because you (a) have a suspected accreta based on imaging studies (ultrasound or MRI study), or (b) are at high risk for having a placenta accreta (for example, at least two prior c-sections with a low lying placenta previa).  Placenta accreta is a condition in which the placenta abnormally invades or grows into the uterine wall.  Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta is lying unusually low in the uterus, next to or covering the cervix.   Why is this study being done?  Surgeries done for patients with placenta previa or accreta are high risk and involve a higher amount of blood loss than normal c-sections. Often, placenta accreta requires complete removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) after performing a c-section to control bleeding. Today, there are no medications commonly used to reduce blood loss in patients with these high risk surgeries.     The purpose of this study is to determine if intravenous tranexamic acid (TA) is effective for reducing blood loss during surgical procedures in women at high risk for hemorrhage due to placenta previa or placenta accreta. TA is not currently FDA approved to treat blood loss during C-sections; however, it is commonly used in other types of surgery for patients who are expected to have a large blood loss, such as hip replacements or open heart surgery.   The current standard of care for patients at high risk for having a placenta accreta or patients suspected of having a placenta acreta is to perform the surgery at a tertiary care hospital with experienced surgeons and operating room teams, with access to blood products if transfusion is needed.  Sometimes, a surgeon will also request placement of balloons in the arteries leading to the uterus to attempt to lower blood loss. You will be receiving the standard of care regardless of whether you choose to participate in the study.

Participant	Initials:________		Page	2	of	11				 How many people will take part in this study? Placenta previa with multiple prior c-sections, and placenta accreta is very rare. About 60 people will take part in this study.   What will happen if I take part in this research study? All study procedures will be done at Community Regional Medical Center. You will be randomized into one of the study groups described below. Randomization means you are put into a group by chance. The investigators will randomize you electronically into one of the groups. Neither you nor your doctor can choose the group you will be in. You will have an equal chance of being placed in any group.    • If you are in group 1: You will be given 1 gram of intravenous TA in your IV immediately after delivery of the infant. • If you are in group 2: You will be given a placebo (no study drug) in your IV immediately after delivery of the infant.   Study Plan Another way to find out what will happen to you during the study is to read the chart below. Start reading at the top and read down the list, following the lines and arrows.                         
Start Here Pregnant with suspected accreta or at high risk for accreta (two prior C-sections + placenta previa)

Participant	Initials:________		Page	3	of	11				 After your surgery, study investigators monitor you throughout your hospital stay and follow up with you at your routine post-operative visits.   How will information about me be kept confidential?  Information will be collected from your medical records. Only study-approved investigators, the Community Medical Centers’ Institutional Review Board, or federal and state regulatory groups will be able to look at or copy medical records. Study records that identify you will be kept confidential and you will be assigned a unique code number.  Some information from your medical records will be collected and used for this study. If you do not have a medical record, one will be created for you. Your signed consent form will be added to your medical record. Therefore, people involved with your future care and insurance may become aware of your participation and of any information added to your medical record as a result of your participation.  How long will I be in the study? Participation in the study begins after consent and concludes with your last post-operative visit. The study drug, however, will only be administered once during your surgery. All other study related follow ups will be during your routine hospital visits.   What are my responsibilities? As a research participant you will be asked to follow the instructions listed in this informed consent form, and notify the study doctor if any information regarding your health or availability to participate in the study changes.  Can I stop being in the study? Yes. You have the right to stop being in the study, without loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. This means that you can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop. She will tell you how to stop your participation safely.   What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?   Below are the risks of participating in this study:  1. Stress or worry from participating in a study. Please remember at any time you can choose to stop participation.  2. Risk of Randomization: You will be assigned between two different treatment groups by chance, and the treatment you receive may prove to be less effective or have more side effects than the other study group.

Unknown risks: The experimental treatments may have side effects that no one knows about yet. The researchers will let you know if they learn anything that might make you change your mind about participating in the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. Tranexamic Acid (TA) medicine may cause some unwanted side effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. Many side effects go away shortly after the drugs are stopped, but in some cases side effects may be serious, long lasting, life threatening or result in death. You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects you experience while taking part in the study. For more information about your condition and research-related injury or about this study you may contact Dr. Kremer at 559-499-6549. Tranexamic acid (TA) is safe and has been studied before in pregnant and postpartum women to reduce bleeding after vaginal deliveries and in women with cesarean sections.  All pregnant and recently pregnant (also known as post partum) women have an increased risk of blood clots in the legs or lungs. In prior studies in these women, TA did not increase the risk of blood clots in the legs or lungs (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) beyond your baseline risk. However, the drug is not thought to be safe to use in patients who have active (pre-existing) blood clots in the legs or lungs (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) or in women with blood clotting disorders or in women with active bleeding in the brain. These women will not be able to participate in the study. The drug also can have a rare side effect of changes in color vision. For this reason, women who are already color-blind cannot participate in the study. Tranexamic acid can be passed into breast milk in very small concentrations but it is safe to participate in the study if you plan to breastfeed or pump. About 1% of the drug levels in your blood can be detected in breast milk one hour later. The drug has a short “half life”, which means that it is present in your body for a short period of time, and is present at significant levels in your blood for only about 2-11 hours after the last dose is given.  Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:  Infrequent: (percentages for how often these side effects occur are not available by the drug manufacturer) • Diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting  • Low blood pressure  • Inflammation of skin caused by an allergic reaction  • Blurred vision  • Giddiness Rare (occuring less than 1% of the time):  • Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)  • Problems with eyesight (color vision changes)  • Blood Clots in the legs or lungs

Participant	Initials:________		Page	5	of	11				• Seizure  • Dizziness or lightheadedness, decreased alertness  • Problems with the kidney or the ureter (due to blood clot formation)  For more information about the risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.   Are there benefits to taking part in the study?  If tranexamic acid is effective in reducing blood loss, the benefit would be less blood loss, less need for blood transfusion, and possibly fewer other complications related to blood loss in surgery (bleeding disorders, low temperature). Also, even if the drug is not effective or helpful to you, the benefit for all participants is to increase our knowledge about ways to treat heavy operative bleeding from placenta previa or placenta accreta for women in the future.   If you are in the group that receives TA and it proves to treat your condition more effectively than the placebo, you may benefit from participating in the study, but this cannot be guaranteed.   What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?  If you wish not to take part in the study, you will receive the standard care for your condition without being in the study and will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.   To end your participation in this study, you must contact the study doctor at the contact information listed on page 1 of this informed consent form.  Your participation in this study is voluntary.  If you do join the study, you may leave the study at any time.  Your decision to participate will not change your relationship with your doctor or the hospital.  The study doctor in charge of the research study can remove you from this study without your consent for any reason, including, but not limited to: a. His/her judgment that any condition or circumstance may jeopardize your welfare such as  increased risk, change in potential benefit, or the integrity of the study. b. Your failure to follow the instructions of the study staff. c. If the study is stopped by the sponsor, study doctor, IRB, or FDA.  Will my medical information be kept private?

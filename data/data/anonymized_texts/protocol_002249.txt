Name of Sponsor/Company: PTC Therapeutics  
Name of Investigational Product: PTC923   
Protocol Number: PTC923 -MD-003-PKU  Phase: 3 Country: Global  
Title of Study:  A Phase 3 Study of PTC923 in Subjects with Phenylketonuria  
Stud y Period:  1.75 years  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of PTC923 in reducing blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in 
subjects with phenylketonuria (PKU) as measured by mean change in blood Phe 
levels from baseline to Weeks 5 and 6 (ie, the average of each respective treatment 
dose 2 -week p eriod of double -blind treatment)  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the proportion of subjects  with baseline Phe levels ≥600 μmol/ L who 
achieve Phe levels <600 μmol/ L at the end of the double -blind treatment period  
• To evaluate the effect of PTC923 dose response on reducing blood Phe levels in 
subjects with PKU  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PTC923 in subjects with PKU  
• To assess the safety of PTC923 in subjects with PKU  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To evaluate changes in blood tyrosine (Tyr) overtime, including the Phe:Tyr ratio  
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 3, double -blind, randomized, multi -center efficacy study of PTC923 
(a synthetic form of sepiapterin) versus placebo in subjects with PKU. Part  1 of the study tests 
for responsiveness to PTC923, with 14  days of open -label treatment with PTC923 7.5 mg /kg 
(subjects 0  to <6 months  of age ), 15 mg/kg (subjects 6 to <12 months  of age ), 30 mg/kg 
(subjects 12 months to <2  years  of age ), or 60 mg/kg (subj ects ≥2 years  of age ) administered 
orally once a day followed by a minimum  14-day PTC923 washout. At the end of treatment in 
Part 1, the mean change in blood Phe levels over the 14 -day treatment period for all subjects 
will be assessed against their pretreatment blood Phe level. Pretreatment blood Phe level will 
be the mean of Day -1 and Day 1 (predose) blood Phe levels. Subjects ≥2 years of age  who 
experience a <15% reduction in blo od Phe levels will be classified as nonresponsive , and 
participation in the study will be terminated. Subjects ≥2 years of age  who experience a 
≥15%  reduction in blood Phe levels will continue into Part 2, which is a randomized, 
placebo -controlled, double -blind treatment period. Subjects <2 years of age who experience a 
<15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be classified as nonresponsive, and participation in 
the study will be terminated. Subjects <2 years of age who experience a ≥ 15% reduction in 
blood P he levels will be offered the option to enroll directly  into an open -label extension 
Study  PTC923 -MD-004-PKU.  Following the minimum 14 -day PTC923 washout period, all 
eligible subjects  ≥2 years of age  will be  randomized to receive either PTC923 or placebo. 
Subjects will be stratified based on their mean percent reduction in blood Phe levels 
(ie, subjects with mean % reduction in Phe levels of ≥15% to <30% and subjects with mean % 
reduction in Phe levels of ≥30%) and evenly distributed to either PTC923 or pla cebo treatment 
arms. Additionally, subjects will be stratified  based on their baseline blood Phe concentration 
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 6 of 92 (ie, subjects with baseline blood Phe <600 µmol/L  and subjects with baseline blood Phe 
≥600  µmol/L) and evenly distributed to either PTC923 or pl acebo treatment . 
Subjects  ≥2 years of age  randomized to PTC923 will receive PTC923  20 mg/kg daily for 
Weeks 1 and 2, then PTC923 40 mg/kg daily for Weeks 3 and 4, then PTC923 60 mg/kg daily 
for Weeks 5 and 6.  
As dosing is weight -based  and to maintain the blind, subjects  randomized to  placebo will 
receive equivalent quantities of placebo to match the 20 to 40 to 60 mg/kg dose escalation of 
the PTC923 treatment arm. After 42 days  of treatment with either PTC923 or placebo, subjects 
will be o ffered the option to enter an open -label extension Study  PTC923 -MD-004-PKU. 
Approximately 45 centers will participate in this study. The  study design is summarized in  the 
figure below . 
 
Abbreviations : Phe, phenylalanine  
Note : Phe responsiveness is defined  as mean Phe reduction ≥15%.  
Screening Period (up to 45 Days):  
An informed consent and/or assent ( as applicable) form must be signed before any 
study -related procedures are performed. After providing consent  and/or assent (as applicable) , 
subjects will undergo  in-clinic  screening procedures to determine study eligibility. Subject 
demographics and medical history information will be collected. Additionally, specific 
information related to previous use of sapropterin or pegvaliase -pqpz should be collected 
(ie, details on duration, dose, if discontinued, the reason(s) why, and if a subject is known to 
be tetrahydrobiopterin  [BH 4]-responsive).  Vital signs, weight, and height measurements will 
be performed. Phenylalanine hydroxylase  gene  (PAH ) genotyping should be performed unless 
already documented in the subject’s medical history. Blood Phe /Tyr levels will be measured . 
A full physical examination will be performed,  and blood samples will be collected for clinical 
laboratory tests and pregnanc y testing. Concomitant medication and adverse events (AEs) will 
be collected from provision of consent and/or assent  (as applicable) . Subjects will be 
instructed to continue their usual diet without modification (ie , no change in daily Phe 
consumption) thr oughout the entire study. Subjects will maintain a 3 -day diet record during 
each week of Screening, and a dietician will monitor each subject’s diet to calculate total 
protein and corresponding Phe consumption, have regular contact with subjects, and reinf orce 
the need for subjects to maintain their usual diet without modification. Subjects who enter the 
study and are receiving pegvaliase -pqpz (PALYNZIQ) supplementation at the Screening Visit 
must complete a 30 -day washout period prior to dosing. Subjects who enter the study and are 
receiving BH 4 supplementation  (eg, sapropterin dihydrochloride, KUVAN)  at the Screening 
Visit must complete a 7 -day washout period prior to dosing.  

PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 7 of 92 Pegvaliase -pqpz Washout (30 Days):  
Following the initial Screening Visit, eligible subjects who are taking pegvaliase -pqpz must 
discontinue the medication as concomitant treatment /supplementation  with pegvaliase -pqpz 
will not be permitted  during the study . Subjects will continue their usual diet without 
modification (ie, no change in daily Phe consumption) and will maintain a 3 -day diet record 
each week during the Pegvaliase -pqpz Washout. A dietician will monitor each subject’s diet to 
calculate total protein and correspo nding Phe consumption, to have regular contact with 
subjects, and to reinforce the need for subjects to maintain their usual diet without 
modification. Blood Phe levels will be measured at each timepoint for the 30 -day washout 
(Days 1, 20, and 30). 
BH 4 Supplementation Washout ( 7 Days ):  
Following the initial Screening Visit, eligible subjects who are taking BH 4 supplementation  
must discontinue the medication as concomitant treatment /supplementation  with BH 4 will not 
be permitted  during the study . Subjec ts will continue their usual diet without modification 
(ie, no change in daily Phe consumption) and will maintain a 3 -day diet record during the BH 4 
Supplementation Washout. A dietician will monitor each subject’s diet to calculate total 
protein and corres ponding Phe consumption, to have regular contact with subjects, and to 
reinforce the need for subjects to maintain their usual diet without modification. Blood will be 
collected  for determination of blood Phe  levels using dried blood sampling  levels at eac h 
timepoint for the 7-day washout (Days  1, 4, and 7).  
Part 1, Open -Label Responsiveness Test (28  to 35 Days):  
Following the initial screening and BH 4 Supplementation/Pegvaliase -pqpz Washout 
(as necessary), all eligible subjects will be enrolled into Part 1 of the study to test for 
responsiveness to PTC923. Subjects will receive PTC923 7.5 mg/kg (subjects 0 to <6  months  
of age ), 15 mg/kg (subjects 6 to  <12 months of age ), 30 mg/kg (subjects 12  months to <2 years  
of age ), or 60 mg/kg (subjects ≥2 years  of age ) for 14 days. On  Part 1 Day 1, subjects will take 
their dose of PTC923 while in the clinic; for all other dosing days, subjects will take their dose 
as an outpatient and prior to coming to the clinic when visits are scheduled. All visits will be 
outpatient visits or virtual visits. Study visits will occur on Part 1 Day 1, Part  1 Day 2 
(PK substudy only), and Part 1 Day 14 (virtual visit, unless in PK substudy ). 
Blood Phe levels will be measured on Days  -1, 1 (predose) , 2 (PK substudy  only), 5, 10, and 
14 of Part 1. Baseline  blood  Phe level will be  calculated as  the mean of the  blood  Phe levels 
from dried blood samples taken on Day -1 and Day 1  (predose) . Blood Phe samples will be 
collected after fasting or no earlier than 3  hours postprandial at approximately the same time 
of day at each collection timepoint.  
Subjects will continue their usual diet without modification and will maintain 3 -day diet 
records (ie, one corresponding to each week of th e PTC923 open -label treatment period). 
A dietician will monitor each subject’s diet to calculate total protein and corresponding Phe 
consumption, to have regular contact with subjects, and to reinforce the need for subjects to 
maintain their usual diet wit hout modification.  
Subjects participating in the PK substudy:  Approximately 30 subjects ≥12 years  of age  will 
participate in the PK substudy. At least 12 out of the 30 subjects ≥12 years of age participating 
in the PK substudy will be female. In addition, up to 6 subjects from each of the se age groups  
will be included : 1) <2 years ; 2) 2 to 5  years ; and 3) 6 to 11 years. Blood samples will be 
collected from subjects participating in PK substudy to characterize the PK of sepiapterin and 
BH 4 following an intensive schedule on Part 1 Day 1 and Part 1 Day 2  for subjects ≥2 years . 
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 8 of 92 For subjects <2 years  of age  participating  in the substudy , blood samples (2 on each occasion ; 
total of 4 samples)  will be collected  on Part 1 Day 1 and Part  1 Day  14.  
In addition to blood drawn for PK sampling at specified timepoints, a small amount of blood 
will be drawn to a minicollect tube (~0.25 mL) at the same time and applied to the VAMS 
device for blood Phe and Tyr measurement.   
Part 1, PTC923 Washout (14 Days Minimum)  
Following completion of 14 days of PTC923 open -label treatment, subjects will begin a 
minimum 14 -day washout. No in -clinic study visits are required during the PTC923 washout. 
In Part 1, b lood Phe levels  will be measured on Day s 19, 24, and 28 . Blood Phe samples will 
be collected after fasting or no earlier than 3  hours postprandial at approximately the same 
time of day at each collection timepoint.  Subjects will continue their usual diet without 
modification and will maintain a 3 -day diet reco rd (ie, one corresponding to each week of the 
PTC923 washout) . A dietician will monitor each subject’s diet to calculate total protein and 
corresponding Phe consumption, to have regular contact with subjects, and to reinforce the 
need for subjects to maint ain their usual diet without modification.  
During the PTC923 washout, the mean change in blood Phe levels over the 14 days of 
PTC923 treatment (mean of Part 1 Day s 5, 10, and 14) will be measured and compared against 
their pretreatment blood Phe level (me an of Part  1 Day  -1 and Part 1 Day 1  [predose] ).  
Subjects who experience <15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be classified as 
nonresponsive and will be contacted to schedule an  Early Termination Visit  (ETV)  (on or 
between Day 28 to Day 35 ).  
Subjects  ≥2 years  of age who experience a ≥15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be 
contacted to confirm their continued eligibility and to schedule the Part 2 Day 1 visit.  
Subjects <2 years of age who experience a ≥ 15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be offer ed 
the option to enroll directly into an open -label extension Study PTC923 -MD-004-PKU.  
Part 1 for all subject s ends on Day 35. In no circumstances will a subject be permitted to 
continue in Part 1 beyond Day 35. If a subject’s blood Phe concentrations are  not available for 
determination of responsiveness to PTC923 by Day 35 of Part 1, then that subject will be 
classified as nonresponsive and will be contacted to schedule an ETV  and not be eligible to 
continue into Part 2 of the study or further participation in an open -label extension 
Study  PTC923 -MD-004-PKU.  
Part 2, Randomized , Double -Blind Treatment Period (42 Days):  
All eligible subjects ≥2 years of age  will be randomized to r eceive either PTC923 or placebo 
for 42 days (ie,  6 weeks) in Part 2, the randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind treatment 
period. Subjects will be stratified based on their mean percent blood Phe reduction in Part 1 
(mean % reduction in blood Phe lev els of ≥15% to <30% and mean % reduction in blood Phe 
levels of ≥30%) and evenly distributed across both treatment arms (PTC923 or placebo). 
Additionally, subjects will be stratified based on their baseline blood Phe concentration 
(ie, subjects with baseli ne blood Phe <600 µmol/L and subjects with baseline blood Phe 
≥600  µmol/L) and evenly distributed to either PTC923 or placebo . This portion of the study is 
double -blinded. Subjects will continue their usual diet without modification and will maintain 
3-day diet records (one corresponding to each week of Part 2). A dietician will monitor each 
subject’s diet to calculate total protein and corresponding Phe consumption, to have regular 
contact with subjects, and to reinforce the need for subjects to maintain t heir usual diet without 
modification. Subjects  randomized to  PTC923 will receive PTC923 20  mg/kg daily for Days 1 
to 14 (ie, Weeks 1 and 2), then PTC923 40 mg/kg daily for Days 15 to 28  (ie, Weeks 3 and 4), 
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 9 of 92 then PTC923 60 mg/kg daily for Days 29 to 42 (ie,  Weeks 5 and 6). As dosing is weight -based 
and to maintain the blind, subjects  randomized to  placebo will received equivalent quantities 
of placebo to match the 20 to 40 to 60 mg/kg dose escalation with PTC923.  
On Part 2 Day 1, subjects will take their dos e of study drug (PTC923 20 mg/kg or placebo) in  
clinic; for all other dosing days, subjects will take their dose at home and prior to coming to 
the clinic when visits are scheduled. All visits will be outpatient visits or virtual visits. 
Study  visits will occur on Part 2 Day 1, Part 2 Day 14 (in -clinic visit for PK substudy only), 
Part 2 Day 28 (in -clinic visit for PK substudy population) , and Part  2 Day  42 to conduct study 
evaluations, collect 3 -day diet record , and capture any AEs and concomitant medicati ons. 
Blood Phe levels  will be measured in Part 2 on Days -1, 1 (predose) , 5, 10, 14, 19, 24, 28, 33, 
38, and 42. Blood Phe samples will be collected after fasting or no earlier than 3 hours 
postprandial at approximately the same time of day at each collect ion timepoint.  
On Part 2 Day 1 (predose), the Phenylketonuria -quality of life (PKU -QOL) (Parent PKU -QOL 
[6 to 8 years]; Child PKU -QOL [9 to 11 years]; Adolescent PKU -QOL [12 to 17  years]; 
Adult  PKU -QOL  [≥18  years])  will be conducted  using the tool in one o f the following 
validated languages: English (British or American ), Turkish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, 
Portuguese, or French. Conduct of the PKU -QOL will not be required for subjects whose 
primary language is not one of the available validated langu ages. On Part 2 Day 1 (predose),  
the European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D) (European Quality of 
Life-5 Dimensions for Youth [EQ -5D-Y] Proxy Version 1 [3 to 7  years]; EQ -5D-Y [8 to 
15 years]; and 5 -Level European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions (EQ -5D-5L) [≥16 years]) will 
be conducted.  
PK substudy only:  Blood samples (2 samples/occasion) will be collected from subjects in 
Part 2 on Days 1, 14, 28, and 42 visits to characterize the PK of sepiapterin and BH 4 at predose 
(approximately 24 hours post the dose on prior day , except for Day 1 , and prior to the dose of 
the day ) and 4 hours postdose .  
End of Study:  
For subjects <2 years of age, End of Study is defined as their final visit in Part 1 and should 
occur on/between Pa rt 1 Day 28 and Part 1 Day 35. All subjects <2 years of age who 
experience a ≥ 15% reduction in blood Phe levels during Part 1 will be offered the option to 
enroll directly into an open -label extension Study PTC923 -MD-004-PKU . 
For subjects ≥2 years of age who complete Part 2, End of Study is defined as their final study 
visit on Part  2 Day 42. All subjects who complete Part 2 will be given the opportunity to 
continue treatment in the PTC923 Open -Label Extension Study, PTC923 -MD-004-PKU.  
Early Termination Vis it: 
An ETV will be performed on or between Day 28 to Day 35  for all subjects who are 
determined to be non -responders in Part 1, or within 2 days for any subject who discontinues 
the study prematurely during Part 1 or Part 2 for any other reason. During the ETV, 3 -day diet 
records, AEs, concomitant medications, wei ght, vital signs, ECGs, and blood Phe/Tyr levels 
will be collected. A physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and a pregnancy test will 
be performed. For non -responsive subjects and subjects who discontinue prematurely, 
following the End of Study visit, subjects may revert to their prestudy treatment for PKU 
(at the investigators  and the subject’s treating physician discretion), and a phone follow -up 
visit will occur 30  (±3) days after the last dose of study drug to assess for serious adverse 
event s (SAEs).  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 10 of 92 Sample Size Justification:  
All subjects  ≥2 years of age  with ≥15% response to PTC923 will be eligible to be randomized 
in Part 2 of the study. Subjects will be stratified in Part 2 based on their mean percent blood 
Phe reduction in Part 1 (ie, subjects with mean % reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥15% to 
<30% and subjects with mean % reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥30%). Within each stratum, 
subjects will be randomized and allocated 1:1 to receive either PTC923 or placebo. Enrollment 
will continue until approximately 80 subjects from the stratum of subjects w ith mean percent 
reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥30% during Part 1 have been randomized. Additionally, 
subjects will be stratified based on their baseline blood Phe concentration (ie, subjects with 
baseline blood Phe  <600  µmol/L and subjects with baselin e blood Phe ≥600 µmol/L) and 
evenly distributed to either PTC923 or placebo treatment arms.  
For the primary endpoint with a sample size of 80 subjects for the stratum of subjects with 
mean percent reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥30% during Part 1, the p ower to detect a 
difference in reduction in blood Phe between PTC923 and placebo is >95%, assuming a 
treatment difference of 250 µmol/L and a within -treatment -group standard deviation of 
250 µmol/L, with a 2 -sided α of 0.05.  
For the primary endpoint for al l subjects in Part 2, the power to detect a difference in reduction 
in blood Phe between PTC923 and placebo is >95%, assuming a treatment difference of 
200 µmol/L, a within -treatment -group standard deviation of 250 µmol/L, and a total sample 
size of 106, w ith a 2 -sided α of 0.05. This sample size assumes approximately 60% of the 
subjects ≥2 years of age enrolled in Part 1 experience a ≥15% reduction in Phe levels.  
Number of Subjects (Planned):  
Approximately 80 subjects with PKU aged ≥2 years  who achieve a ≥30% reduction from 
baseline in blood Phe levels during the responsiveness test (Part 1) will be enrolled in the 
placebo -controlled treatment period to receive either PTC923 or placebo (Part  2). 
Approximately 178 subjects are expected to be enrolled in Part 1 of the study to achieve this.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
Subjects with any PAH  mutation are permitted to screen and enroll into the study. However, 
subjects with biochemically diagnosed classical PKU (ie, blood Phe birth levels ≥1200  µmol/L 
and or historical evidence of Phe concentrations ≥1200  µmol/L in their medical history) will 
be capped at 20%  of the total study population. Genotyping will not be required for study 
eligibility; however, all subjects will undergo  genotyping unless documented in their medical 
history and these data will be collected for analysis.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Informed consent and assent (if necessary , at the investigator’s discretion  [ie, for 
children and/or subjects  who are mentally impaire d secondary to disease]) with 
parental/legal guardian consent  
2. Male or female subjects of any age 
3. Uncontrolled blood Phe level ≥360 μmol/L on current therapy anytime during 
Screening and uncontrolled blood Phe level ≥360 μmol/L on current therapy when 
taking the average of the 3 most recent Phe levels from the subject’s medical history 
(inclusive of the Screening value)  
4. Clinical diagnosis of PKU with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA)  documented by past 
medical history of at least 2 blood Phe measurements ≥600 μmo l/L

PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 13 of 92 Duration of Treatment:  
All enrolled subjects will receive PTC923 for 2 weeks in Part 1. Subjects ≥2 years  of age  with 
≥15% response to PTC923 will continue treatment in Part 2 with PTC923 or placebo for 
6 weeks.  Subjects  <2 years  of age  with ≥ 15% response to PTC923 in Part 1 will be offered the 
option to enroll directly into an open -label extension Study PTC923 -MD-004-PKU.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
The reference therapy is Placebo for PTC923 Powder f or Oral Use . In Part 2, subjects ≥2 years 
of age  randomized to placebo will receive Placebo for PTC923 Powder for Oral Use for 
6 weeks . All doses will be administered orally, once a day with food.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy endpoints:  
The primary e fficacy measure will be reduction in blood Phe levels in subjects with PKU as 
measured by mean change in Phe levels from baseline to Part 2 Weeks 5 and 6 (ie, the average 
of the 2 -week period at the target dose of double -blind treatment). Baseline blood Ph e level 
will be the mean of Day -1 and Day 1 (predose ) blood Phe levels.  
The secondary efficacy endpoint s are the proportion of subjects  with baseline Phe levels 
≥600  μmol/ L who achieve Phe levels <600 μmol/ L at the end of the double -blind treatment 
period  and the change from baseline in mean blood Phe levels at each PTC923 dose level 
(ie, each 2 -week period in Part 2) . 
The exploratory efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in blood Tyr over  time, 
including the Phe:Tyr ratio.  
Safety endpoints:  
Safety  and tolerability of PTC923 as measured by severity and number of treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be compared to placebo.  
Pharmacokinetics endpoint s: 
Depending on the number of samples obtained, the following PK parameters of sepiapterin 
and BH 4 for a given subject may be calculated using noncompartmental methods:  Cmax, Tmax, 
T1/2, area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24h), 
area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity ( AUC 0-inf), apparent 
total clearance  of the drug from plasma following oral administration  (CL/F), and  apparent 
volume of distribution  during terminal phase after n on-intravenous administration  (Vz/F ). 
Additionally, depending on the number of samples collected and subject demography, a 
population PK analysis will be performed using all PK samples collected in the study to 
further characterize the PK of sepiapterin an d BH 4 to examine potential source of PK 
variability, such as age, and to explore the relationship between exposure and response.  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Sets:  
Full Analysis Set (FAS ): All subjects who are randomized and take at least 1 dose of 
double -blind study drug in Part 2 will be included in the FAS. Subjects will be analyzed 
according to their randomized treatment. All efficacy analyses will be based on the FAS.  
Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set : The PP Analysis Set will include all subjects in the FAS who 
meet the study eligibility requirements and have no major protocol deviations that affect the 
validity of the efficacy measurements. The PP Analysis Set will be used for sensitivity 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. The criteria for  inclusion in the PP Analysis Set will 
be finalized prior to study unblinding and detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 14 of 92 Safety Analysis Set : All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug, including during 
Part 1, will be included in the Safety Analysis Set. Subjects will be analyzed according to 
actual treatment received.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set : All subjects who have at least one measurable plasma 
concentration of  sepiapterin or BH 4 will be included in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set.  
Efficacy : 
All efficacy analyses will be performed based on the FAS. The primary endpoint analysis will 
also be conducted using the PP Analysis Set.  
The null hypothesis of this study is that the mean change in Phe levels from baseline to end of 
the double -blind treatment period is the same in the PTC923 arm and in the placebo arm 
versus the alternative that they are different; a 2 -sided test at the 5% alpha level will be 
applied.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, a gatekeeping procedure will be used to control the 
familywise error rate:  
The stratum of subjects ≥2 years of age with mean percent reduction in Phe levels of ≥30% 
during Part 1 will be tested at the significance level of 0. 05 (2-sided). If p<0.05 then the study 
will be declared positive in this stratum.  
Only if the stratum of subjects ≥2 years of age  with mean percent reduction in Phe levels of 
≥30% during Part  1 is statistically significant at the 0.05 level, will the overall study with all 
subjects  ≥2 years of age  with a mean percent reduction in Phe levels of ≥15% during Part 1 be 
tested, also at the 0.05 significance level.  
For the primary endpoint of reduction in blood Phe for the stratum of subjects with mean 
perce nt reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥30% during Part 1, a mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM) model will be fitted using the available blood Phe data. The response 
variable is the change from baseline in blood Phe measured at post -baseline assessments for  
each subject. The model will include fixed effects for treatment, baseline blood Phe, baseline 
Phe stratum (<600 μmol/L  or ≥600 μmol/L), visit (categorical), and visit -by-treatment 
interaction. In addition, subject will be included as random effect. An un structured 
within -subject  covariance structure will be assumed. If the model does not converge under the 
unstructured covariance matrix, the following covariance structures will be employed in order 
until convergence is reached: heterogeneous Toeplitz, het erogeneous Compound Symmetry, 
heterogeneous first -order autoregressive, Toeplitz, Compound Symmetry, and first -order 
autoregressive. The least squares (LS) mean estimate for the average change at Part 2 Weeks 5 
and 6 will be used to perform treatment group  comparisons. The LS means, treatment effect 
estimate, confidence interval, and 2-sided p  value will be presented. Corresponding LS means 
from the same MMRM model will be used to estimate the treatment effects at each visit week.  
For the primary endpoint o f reduction in blood Phe for all subjects, the same MMRM model 
used for the stratum of subjects with mean percent reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥30% 
during Part 1 will be used with the addition of a fixed effect for Phe reduction randomization 
strata  (≥15% or ≥30%) .

Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 15 of 92 Missing data :  
For the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, MMRM model will be used on the available 
data assuming the missing assessments are missing at random (MAR). Missing data will be 
imputed using the multiple imputation procedure to further  assess the influence of missing ness 
and details of the method will be provided in the SAP . Briefly, these methodologies will 
include multiple imputation under an assumption of m issing not at random and tipping -point 
analyses to explore how extreme the difference between randomized treatments would have to 
be among subjects with missing data to overwhelm the treatment effect obtained in the 
primary. In these analyses, the multiple  imputation approach will be expanded to allow for 
varying impact of missing data by incorporating a shift parameter in the imputation model. 
The range of values for the shift parameter will explore the varying missing data assumptions, 
including the scena rio where the imputation model is completely based on the control group 
(ie, control -based imputation).  
Safety : 
All safety analyses will be conducted based on the Safety Analysis Set.  
Safety data will include AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, ph ysical examinations, and 
ECGs. Observed data will be listed by subject and summarized using descriptive statistics by 
treatment group.  
Pharmacokinetics : 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  and plasma concentrations  will be summarized separately 
following different PK sampling scheme and population using descriptive statistics.

1.1. Phenylketonuria  
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal -recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized  by 
deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) , which metabolizes  phenylalanine 
(Phe) (Scriver 2001 ). Gene mutations of PAH result in decreased catalytic activity leading to 
hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) (Al Hafid 2015 ). There are many different mutations in the PAH  
gene (>1100), resulting in phenotypic variation in the amount of enzyme produced and/or 
enzyme activity. Patients with severe forms of PKU, also known as “classical PKU”, typically 
have very high blood phenylalanine ( Phe) levels (>1200 μmol/L). A partial deficiency of PAH 
activity results in a lower degree of blood Phe elevation. High levels o f Phe are toxic to the brain 
and are associated with cognitive dysfunction, memory impairment , and can lead to psychiatric 
and behavioral  problems (Kaufman 1989 ). If left untreated, severe and irreversible intellectual 
disability can occur (Scriver 2001 , Waisbren 2007 ). Phenylketonuria  is diagnosed  at birth with 
the near universal adoption of newborn screening. Phenylketonuria  has been described in all 
ethnic groups, and its incidence worldwide varies widely, but is estimated to occur in 
approximately 1 in every 23930  births  (Hillert 2020 ).  
1.2. Current Treatmen t of Phenylketonuria  
Currently, there is no cure for PKU. Initial treatment consists of prompt institution of stringent 
Phe dietary restriction supplemented with specifically designed medical foods. Dietary control is 
considered the standard of care  (SoC) . The restriction in protein requires exclusion of natural 
foods such as meat, fish, milk, cheese, bread, nuts, and many other common food items. Even the 
intake of vegetables is limited.  
The success of dietary control, however, comes at high personal cost to affected individuals and 
their families. Compliance with a restrictive diet and Phe monitoring can be difficult for older 
children, adolescents, and adults (Fisch 2000 , Walter 2002 ) and it is accepted that dietary burden 
does not improve with age (MacDonald 2012 ). Lifelong management of Phe levels is critical to 
avoid neurocog nitive decline and other comorbidities  as recognized by the European Guidance 
on PKU and the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidance on PKU (Vockley 
2014 , van Wegberg 2017 ). Recently , it has been reported that >60% of adolescents and 70% of 
adult patients with PKU have uncontrolled blood Phe  levels , with co ncentrations exceeding the 
upper limit of ACMG target range (360  μmol/L) (Jurecki 2017 ). The dietar y restrictions lead to 
social difficulties and exclusions, with the potential to make people with PKU feel different and 
isolated.  
Synthetic tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH 4) (eg, sapropterin dihydrochloride), is commercially available 
as an approved drug for the treatment of HPA in PKU (FDA New Drug Application  [NDA]  
22181, EMEA/H/C/000943). Sapropterin dihydrochloride  is administered orally, once daily at a 
dose of 5 to 20 mg/kg (KUVAN USPI 2020 ). During the Phenylketonuria Scientific Review 
Conference: State of the Science and Future Research Needs , international experts concluded 
that most people with  PKU  have little or no benefit from sapropterin dihydrochloride , and 
evidence of long -term clinical improvements was lacking. They further concluded that “ new 
drugs that are safe, efficacious, and impacting a larger proportion of individuals with PKU are 
needed ” (Camp 2014 ).

V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 25 of 92 PALY NZIQ  (pegvaliase -pqpz) is a commercially available product that was recently approved 
for the treatment of adult patients with PKU (aged 16 years and older in the European Union 
[EU]) who have inadequate blood Phe control (blood Phe levels greater than 600  µmol/L) 
despite prior management with available treatment options including sapropterin ( FDA Biologic s 
License Application 761079, EMEA/H/C/004744). It is a pegylated form of the bacterial derived 
enzyme, phenylalanine ammonia lyase. While effective at he lping lower blood Phe levels to 
<600 µmol/L, it requires a daily injection and patients in clinical studies  experience d significant 
adverse reactions to PALYNZIQ  treatment including anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, 
anaphylactoid reaction, blood creatine phosphokinase increase, anxiety, arthralgia, 
serum -sickness, angioedema, hypophenylalaninemia, injection -site reactions, headache, rash, 
nausea, pruritus , and urticaria, to name a few. PALYNZIQ  is not indicated for patients ≤18 years 
of age in the  United States  and ≤16 years of age  in the EU , and accordingly does not address the 
unmet need for new medications that are safe and efficacious for children and adolescents  
(BioMarin 2020 ).  
1.3. PTC923  
PTC923 ( formerly named CN SA-001) is (S)-2-amino -6-(2-hydroxypropanoyl) -7,8-
dihydropteridin -4(3H) -one with a molecular weight of 237.2 2 g/mol and a molecular formula of 
C9H11N5O3. 
The chemical structure of PTC923  is:  
 
PTC923  is a new molecular entity  and synthetic form of  sepiapterin. Sepiapterin serves as a 
substrate for de novo synthesis of BH 4 via the pterin salvage pathway (Mayer 1995 ), making 
sepiapterin a naturally occurring precursor for BH 4 (Figure  1). Tetrahydrobiopterin  is an 
essential cofactor for enzymes including PAH  (Kaufman 1989 ), tyrosine  (Tyr)  hydroxylase 
(Nagatsu 1964 ), tryptophan hydroxylase (Lovenberg 1967 , Ichiyama 1970 ), fatty acid 
glycerylether oxygenase (Tietz 1964 ), and nitric oxide synthase (Kwon 1989 , Mayer 1991 ). 
Following oral administration, PTC923 is rapidly converted to BH 4 intracellularly (Smith 
2019a ), the natural cofactor of PAH, and is intended to restore BH 4 to physiological levels in 
patients who lack endogenous BH 4, increase BH 4 levels in patients who have lower than normal 
physiological levels of BH 4, or enhance the chaperone effect on PAH in PAH -deficient patients 
by providing pharmacological levels of BH 4 while also directly enhancing the thermal stability 
of PAH.

1.4. Rationale for Study  
Currently, there is no cure for PKU. Control with dietary Phe restriction and/or BH 4 
supplementation is suboptimal.  Tetrahydrobiopterin  supplementation  with KUVAN  has 
demonstrated clinically meaningful lowering of Phe plasma concentrations in approximately 
30% of patients with PKU and was wel l-tolerated at doses of 5 to 20  mg/kg/day over 22  weeks in 
BH 4-responsive patients with PKU (Burnett 2007 ). Further studies showed that the effects on  
blood Phe are dose -related; however, doses of KUVAN  higher than 20  mg/kg/day were not 
tested ( KUVAN  NDA 22 -181 2007 ). PTC923 represents the first viable formulation of 
sepiapterin intended for the treatment of HPA in patients with PKU.   
Study PKU -001 was a Phase 1 exploratory study that assessed the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) of escalating doses of PTC923 administered orally to healthy volunteers. 
This study showed that PTC923 was safe and well tolerated at single doses of up to 80  mg/kg or 
following once -daily dosing at doses up to 60  mg/kg for 7 days. Study PKU -001 also provided 
evidence of increased levels of BH 4 when compared head to head with KUVAN  across 
equivalent doses (Smith 2019b ), that would be expected to result in improved efficacy. 
Following this, Study PKU -002, a Phase 2 study  conducted in subjects with PKU , provided a 
direct head-to-head  comparison of PTC923 and KUVAN,  with a dose comparison of the effect 
of 20  mg/kg/day KUVAN versus 20 mg/kg/day PTC923  versus 60 mg/kg/day PTC923 . In 
Study  PKU -002, PTC923 60 mg/kg was significantly more effective than KUVAN  20 mg/kg in 
reducing  blood Phe (p=0.0098). In addition, comparison of the change in mean blood Phe levels 
showed that t he effect of PTC923 60 mg/kg on blood Phe was approximately 1.4  × larger than 
that of PTC923 20  mg/kg, driving dose decisions for future studies.  There were no notable  
differences in the safety profile of the PTC923 and KUVAN . Study PKU -002 provided proof of 
the change in efficacy of PTC923 with statistically superior reductions in blood Phe levels versus 
KUVAN  and helped to establish dose selection for this s tudy.  
Study PTC923 -MD-003-PKU is a Phase 3 study to assess  the efficacy of PTC923 in reducing 
blood Phe levels in subjects  with PKU . It is anticipated that a greater reduction in Phe will be 
observed in subjects with PKU who receive PTC923 versus those wh o receive placebo.  This 
Phase 3 study is designed to support registration of PTC923 in subjects  with PKU.  

PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 27 of 92 1.5. Rationale for Study Design and Control Group  
Study PTC923 -MD-003-PKU is a double -blind, randomized study that compares PTC923  plus 
SoC to placebo plus SoC. Standard of care in PKU is a Phe -restricted diet.  Aggressive and highly 
restrictive dietary control is the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients. Initial and 
lifelong treatment consisting of prompt institution of Phe dietary restriction supplemented with 
specifically designed medical foods i s the SoC for PKU  (van Wegberg 2017 ). The prestudy 
Phe-restricted diet for each subject will be specifically determined and monitored in this study to 
ensure subjects maintain their current Phe -restrict ed diet throughout the study duration.  
The placebo control selected in this study is considered ethically acceptable, practical, and 
clinically relevant given that the underlining SoC of a Phe -restricted diet will be maintained for 
all subjects. Given the limited safe and effective pharmacological treatment options available for 
PKU, placebo control , together with 1:1 randomization , provides an optimal framework to 
directly assess the efficacy and safety of a new treatment.  
During Part 1 ( the open -label R esponsiveness Test ), subjects with PKU  will be enrolled and 
receive PTC923 for 14 days  to identify subjects  with ≥15% reduction from baseline in blood Phe 
levels.   
Subjects  will receive  the following doses of PTC923 for 14 days:  
• Subjects 0 to <6 months of age - 7.5 mg/kg  
• Subjects 6 to <12 months of age  - 15 mg/kg  
• Subjects 12 months to <2 years of age  - 30 mg/kg  
• Subjects ≥2 years  - 60 mg/kg  
Subjects who experience <15% reduction  in blood Phe levels will be classified as nonresponsive 
and will be contacted to  schedule an Early Termination Visit (ETV) ( on or between Day 28 to 
Day 35 ).  
Subjects <2 years of age who experience a ≥ 15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be offered 
the option to enroll directly into an open -label extension Study PTC923 -MD-004-PKU .  
PTC923 -responsive subjects ≥2 years  of age  will be entered into  Part 2 ( the double -blind, 
randomi zed Treatment Period ). Subjects in the PTC923 treatment arm will receive  PTC923 
20 mg/kg daily for Weeks 1 and 2, then PTC923 40 mg/kg daily for Weeks 3 and 4, then 
PTC923 60 mg/kg daily for Weeks 5 and 6. As dosing is weight -based and to maintain the blind, 
subjects in the placebo arm will receive equivalent quantities of placebo to match the 20 to 40 to 
60 mg/kg dose escalation of the PTC923 treat ment arm. After 6 weeks of treatment with either 
PTC923 or placebo, subjects will be offered the option to enter an open -label extension  
Study  PTC923 -MD-004-PKU.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 28 of 92 The study inclusion criteria w ere developed to include  the broadest possible criteria to refle ct the 
wider PKU population, while excluding subjects  who may be at risk from participation or may 
confound data interpretation. Subjects must have a clinical diagnosis of PKU with  HPA  
documented by past medical history of at least 2 blood Phe measurement s ≥600 µmol/L. Another  
inclusion criterion specifies subjects must have blood Phe levels  ≥360  µmol/L during screening, 
or when taking the average of the 3 most recent Phe levels from the subject ’s medical history 
(inclusive of the Screening value). Setting the values at ≥360  µmol/L allows  the inclusion of 
children, in whom Phe levels above 360 µmol/L would be considered uncontrolled. If the Phe 
levels were to be set at ≥600 µmol/L, the study would principally enrol l adult subjects  only. 
While larger changes in Phe levels may be observed if the starting levels are higher, excluding 
younger subjects  with lower levels of Phe would be short -sighted. Nevertheless, a second 
stratification will ensure that subjects with baseline blood Phe of <600 µmol/L and subject s with 
baseline blood Phe ≥600 µmol/L are equally distributed to receive PTC923 or placebo.  
1.6. Study Duration  
The study duration for each subject will be up to 107 days from Screening to the final study visit. 
Following a screening period  of up to 45 days, all enrolled subjects will receive PTC923 2  weeks 
followed by a  minimum  14-day PTC923 washout period  in Part 1. Subjects  ≥2 years of age with 
≥15% response to PTC923 will continue treatment in Part 2 with either PTC923 or placebo for 
6 weeks.  Subjects <2 year s of age with ≥15% response to PTC923 will be offered the option to 
enroll directly into an open -label extension Study  PTC923 -MD-004-PKU . 
1.7. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected adverse events  (AEs) of PTC923 can be found in the current version of the IB  and 
associated reference safety information .  
Clinical knowledge exists for PTC92 3 as it has been evaluated in  more than 102 subjects in  
4 clinical studies  including 24 subjects with PKU. Across all studies, PTC923 has been well 
tolerated and exhibited a favorable safety profile  with manageable side effects. Further, 
Study  PTC923 -MD-003-PKU will have a data and safety monitoring board that will closely 
monitor the safety of subjects.  
When developing the inclusion/exclusion criteria and study design for this study, PTC 
Therapeutics  (PTC) identified benefits and risks with mitigation s trategies that  ensured the safety 
of subjects and veracity of data collected . 
As per inclusion criteria 3, eligible subjects  for this study have  uncontrolled PKU with blood Phe 
level ≥360  μmol/L on current therapy anytime during Screening and uncontrolled blood Phe 
level ≥360  μmol/L on current therapy.  PTC923 has been shown to provide statistically 
significant, dose -related reductions in blood Phe and was faster and more efficacious in reducing 
blood Phe compared to sapropterin in subjects with uncontrolled  PKU  (Bratkovic 2022 ). Further, 
in subjects with classical PKU, the reduction in mean blood Phe with PTC923 was also larger 
than that observed with sapropterin.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 29 of 92 To minimize exposure to placebo, Part 2 (randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind 
treatment period) duration is capped at 6 weeks. This duration permits adequate analysis of 
efficacy of PTC923  versus placebo but minimizes placebo exposure. During this period,  blood 
Phe levels will be extensively monitored to ensure safety of subjects.  No subject aged <2 years 
will be exposed to placebo.  
To reduce exposure of nonresponsive subjects to PTC923, in Part 1 , all eligible subjects will be 
tested for responsiveness to PTC923.  Subjects ≥2 years of age who experience  <15% reduction  
in blood Phe levels  and subjects <2 years of age who experience a < 15% reduction in blood Phe 
levels will be classified as nonresponsive, and participation in the study will be terminated. To 
minimize exposure of subjects <2 years of age to placebo, subjects who experience a ≥ 15% 
reduction in blood Phe levels will be offered the option to enroll directly into an open -label 
extension Study  PTC923 -MD-004-PKU.  
During this study, blood Phe will be monitored frequently to assess the responsivenes s and 
efficacy of treatment. PTC has demonstrated that  dried blood sample collection using the 
volumetric absorptive microsampling  (VAMS ) high-performance liquid chromatography and 
mass spectrometry  (HPLC /MS/MS ) method is reliable, repeatable, and the results are 
comparable to a conventional venous blood sampling human plasma HPLC /MS/MS method. 
Samples collected in the Phase 2 study (Study  PKU-002) demonstrated no bias over the 
measurable Phe concentration range using VAMS dried blood method. Compared to a standard 
blood draw (> 2 mL) to measure blood Phe, dried blood VAMS uses sample volumes of 10 to 
20 µL and produces reliable blood Phe concentration quantification. The  VAMS dried blood 
method allows blood Phe sa mples to be collected at home in accordance with GCP, a critical 
advantage given the current coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID -19) pandemic when 
unpredictable and unplanned closings of clinical sites occur and prevent regular clinical visits or 
potentially e xpose patients to unnecessary risks.  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in this study, 
the potential risks identified in association with PTC923 are justified by the anticipated benefits 
that may be afforded to subjects with PKU.

3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, double -blind, randomized, multi -center efficacy study of PTC923 versus 
placebo in subjects with PKU.  
Part 1 of the study tests for responsiveness to PTC923, w ith 14  days of open -label treatment with 
PTC923 7.5 mg/kg (subjects 0 to <6 months of age), 15 mg/kg (subjects 6 to <12 months of age), 
30 mg/kg (subjects 12 months to <2 years of age), or 60 mg/kg (subjects ≥2 years of age) 
administered orally once a day followed by a minimum of 14 days PTC923 washout. At the end 
of treatment in Part 1, the mean change in blood Phe levels over the 14 -day treatment period for 
all subjects will be assessed against their pretreatment blood Phe level. Pretreatment blood Phe 
level will be the mean of Day -1 and Day 1 (predose ) blood Phe levels. Subjects ≥2 years of age 
who experience a <15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be classified as non -responsive and 
participation in the study will be terminated. Subjects ≥2 years of age who experience a 
≥15%  reduction in blood Phe levels will continue into Part 2, which is a randomized, 
placebo -controlled, double -blind treatment period. Subjects <2 years of age who experience 
≥15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be offe red the option to enroll directly into an 
open -label extension Study  PTC923 -MD-004-PKU . Subjects <2 years of age who experience a 
<15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be classified as nonresponsive, and participation in the 
study will be terminated.  Following the minimum 14 -day PTC92 3 washout period, all eligible 
subjects will be randomized in Part 2 to receive either PTC923 or placebo. Subjects will be 
stratified based on their mean percent reduction in blood Phe levels (ie,  subjects with mean % 
reducti on in Phe levels of ≥15% to <30% and subjects with mean % reduction in Phe levels of 
≥30%) and evenly distributed to either PTC923 or placebo treatment arms. Additionally, subjects 
will be stratified based on their baseline blood Phe concentration (ie, sub jects with baseline 
blood Phe <600 µmol/L and subjects with baseline blood Phe ≥600  µmol/L) and evenly 
distributed to either PTC923 or placebo.  
Subjects randomized to  PTC923 will receive PTC923 20 mg/kg daily for Weeks 1 and 2, then 
PTC923 40 mg/kg daily f or Weeks 3 and 4, then PTC923 60 mg/kg daily for Weeks 5 and 6. As 
dosing is weight -based and to maintain the blind, subjects randomized to  placebo will receive 
equivalent quantities of placebo to match the 20 to 40 to 60 mg/kg dose escalation of the 
PTC923 treatment arm. After 6 weeks of treatment with either PTC923 or placebo, subjects will 
be offered the option to enter an open -label extension Study PTC 923-MD-004-PKU. 
Approximately 45 centers will participate in this study. The study design is summarized in 
Figure 2 and the Schedule of Assessments is pre sented in  Table  1 (Screening Period) and  
Table  2 (Parts  1 and 2) . 
Throughout the study , subjects will maintain 3 -day diet record s corresponding to each week of 
the study. At each in -clinic visit, a  dietician will monitor each subject’s diet to calculate total 
protein and corresponding Phe consumption, to have regular contact with subjects, and to 
reinforce the need for subjects to maintain their usual diet without modification  (Section  8.1.7 ). 
Virtual visits are acceptable  as indicated /or deemed necessary  in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  2). However, if study staff feel it necessary and/or appropriate, these visits may be 
conducted at t he study site instead.

An informed consent and/or assent (as applicable) form must be signed before any study -related 
procedures are performed. After providing consent and/or assent (as applicable), subjects will 
undergo in -clinic screening procedures to determine study eligibility. Subject demographics and 
medical history information will be collected . Additionally, specific information related to 
previous use of sapropterin or pegvaliase -pqpz should be collected (ie, details on duration, dose, 
if discontinued, the reason [s] why, and if a subject is known to be BH 4-responsive).  Vital signs, 
weight, and height measurements will be performed . Phenylalanine hydroxylase gene  (PAH ) 
genotyping shou ld be performed un less already document ed in subject’s medical history.  Blood 
Phe/Tyr levels will be measured.  Vital signs, weight, and height measurements will be 
performed. A full physical examination will be performed,  and blood samples will be collected 
for clinical laboratory tests and pregnancy testing. Concomitant medication and AEs will be 
collected from p rovision of consent and/or assent  (as applicable) . Subjects will be instructed to 
continue their usual diet without modification (ie, no change in daily Phe consumption) 
throughout the entire study. Subjects will maintain a 3-day diet record during each we ek of 
Screening , and a dietician will monitor each subject’s diet to calculate total protein and 
corresponding Phe consumption, have regular contact with subjects, and reinforce the need for 
subjects to maintain their usual diet without modification . Subje cts who enter the study and are 
receiving pegvaliase -pqpz supplementation at the Screening Visit  must complete a 30 -day 
washout period prior to dosing. Subjects who enter the study and are receiving BH 4 
supplementation (eg, sapropterin  dihydrochloride, KUV AN) at the Screening Visit must 
complete a 7-day washout period prior to dosing.  
3.1.1.1.  Pegvaliase -pqpz Washout (30 Days)  
Following the initial Screening Visit, eligible subjects who are taking pegvaliase -pqpz must 
discontinue the medication as concomitant treatment /supplementation  with pegvaliase -pqpz will 
not be permitted  during the study . Pegvaliase -pqpz will be discontinued 24 hours prior to starting 
the Washout. Subjects will continue their usual diet without modification (ie, no change in daily 
Phe con sumption) and will maintain a 3-day diet record during the Pegvaliase -pqpz Washout. A 
dietician will monitor each subject’s diet to calculate total protein and corresponding Phe 
consumption, to have regular contact with subjects, and to reinforce the need for subjects to 
maintain their usual diet without modification. Blood Phe levels will be measured at each 
timepoint for the  30-day washout (Days 1, 20, and 30). 
3.1.1.2.  BH 4 Supplementation Washout ( 7 Days ) 
Following the initial Screening Visit, eligible subjects w ho are receiving  BH 4 supplementation 
must discontinue the medication as  concomitant treatment /supplementation  with BH 4 will not be 
permitted  during the study . BH 4 treatment  (eg, sapropterin dihydrochloride, KUVAN) will be 
discontinued 24 hours prior to sta rting the Supplementation Washout. Subjects will continue 
their usual diet without modification (ie, no change in daily Phe consumption) and will maintain 
a 3-day diet record during the BH 4 Supplementation Washout.  A dietician will monitor each 
subject’s diet to calculate total protein and corresponding Phe consumption, to have regular 
contact with subjects, and to reinforce the need for subjects to maintain their usual diet without 
modification. Blood will be collec ted for determination of blood Phe levels at each timepoint for 
the 1 -week washout (Days 1, 4, and 7) using dried blood sampling.

3.1.2.1.  Part 1, Open -Label Treatment (14 Days)  
Following the initial Screening Visit  and BH 4 Supplementation /Pegvaliase -pqpz  Washout 
(as necessary), all eligible subjects will be enrolled into Part 1 of the study to test for 
responsiveness to PTC923. Subjects will receive  the following doses of PTC923 for 14 days:  
• Subjects 0 to <6 mo nths of age: 7.5 mg/kg  
• Subjects 6 to <12 months of age: 15 mg/kg  
• Subjects 12 months to <2 years of age: 30 mg/kg  
• Subjects ≥2 years: 60 mg/kg  
On Part 1 Day 1, subjects will take their dose of PTC923 while in the clinic; for all other dosing 
days, subjects will take their dose at home  and prior to coming to the clinic when visits are 
scheduled. All visits will be outpatient visits or virtual visi ts. Study visits will occur on Part 1 
Day 1, Part 1 Day 2 (PK substudy only), and Part 1 Day 14 (virtual visit, unless part of the PK 
substudy).  
In Part 1, b lood Phe levels  will be measured on Days  -1, 1 (predose) , 2 (PK s ubstudy only) , 5, 
10, and 14 . Baseline blood Phe level will be calculated as the mean of the blood Phe levels from 
dried blood samples taken on Day -1 and Day 1 (predose). Samples will be collected after fasting 
or no earlier than 3  hours postprandial at approximately the same time of day at each collection 
timepoint.  
Subjects will continue their usual diet without modification and will maintain 3 -day diet  records 
(ie, one corresponding to each week of the PTC923 open -label treatment period). A dietician will 
monitor each subject’s die t to calculate total protein and corresponding Phe consumption and to 
have regular contact with subjects.

Approximately 30 subjects ≥12 years  of age  will participate in the PK substudy. At least 12 out 
of the 30 subjects ≥12 years  of age  participating in the PK substudy will be female. In addition, 
up to 6 subjects from each of the se age groups  will be included : 1) <2 years ; 2) 2 to 5  years ; and 
3) 6 to 11 years. Blood samples will be collected  from subjects participating in the PK su -study 
to characterize the PK of sepiapterin and BH 4 following an intensive schedule on Part 1 Day 1 
and Part 1 Day 2  from subjects  ≥2 years . For subjects <2 years  of age , blood samples (2 on each 
occasion ; total of 4 samples ) will be collected on Part 1 Day 1  and Part  1 Day  14. 
In addition to blood drawn fo r PK sampling  at speci fied timepoints , a small amount of blood will 
be drawn to a  minicollect tube ( ~0.25 mL) at the same time and ap plied to the VAMS device for 
blood Phe and Tyr measurement . Details will be described  in the lab oratory  manual.

Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 34 of 92 3.1.2.2.  Part 1, PTC923 Washout ( 14 Days Minimum ) 
Following completion of 14 days of PTC923 open -label treatment, subjects will begin a 
minimum 14 -day washout. No in -clinic study visits are required during the PTC923 washout. In 
Part 1, b lood Phe levels will be measured on Day s 19, 24, and 28.  Blood Phe samples will be 
collected after fasting or no earlier than 3  hours postprandial at approximately the same time of 
day at each collection timepoint.  
Subjects will continue their usual diet without modification and will maintain 3 -day diet records 
(ie, one corresponding to each week of the PTC923 washout).  A dietician will monitor each 
subject’s diet to calculate total protein and corresponding Phe consumption, to have regular 
contact with subjects, and to reinforce the need for subjects to maintain their usual diet without 
modification.  
During the PTC923 washout, the mean change in blood Phe levels  over the 14 days of PTC923 
treatment (mean of Part 1 Day s 5, 10, and 14) will be me asured and compared against their 
pretreatment blood Phe level  (mean of Part  1 Day -1 and Part 1 Day 1  [predose] ). PTC will allow 
determination of a subject’s participation in Part 2 with ≤2 pretreatment blood Phe levels (but 
requiring a minimum of 1 pretr eatment level) and ≤3 PTC923 treatment blood Phe levels  (but 
requiring a minimum of 1 PTC923 treatment level), depending on the available data (on or 
between Part 1 Study Day 28 to Day 35).  
Subjects ≥2 years of age  who experience <15% reduction in blood Ph e levels will be classified as 
non-responsive and will be contacted to schedule an ETV  (on or between Day 28 to Day 35 ) 
(Section  3.1.5 ). Subjects  ≥2 years  of age  who experience a ≥15 % reduction in blood Phe levels 
will be contacted to confirm their continued eligibility and to schedule the Part 2 Day 1 visit.   
Subjects <2 yea rs of age who experience a < 15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be classified 
as nonresponsive, and participation in the study will be terminated. Subjects <2 years of age who 
experience a ≥ 15% reduction in blood Phe levels will be offered the option to  enroll directly into 
an open -label extension Study PTC923 -MD-004-PKU . 
Part 1 for all subject s ends on Day 35. In no circumstances will a subject be permitted to 
continue in Part 1 beyond Day 35. If a subject’s blood Phe concentrations are not available fo r 
determination of responsiveness to PTC923 by Day 35 of Part 1, then that subject will be 
classified as nonresponsive and will be contacted to schedule an ETV and not be eligible to 
continue into Part 2 of the study or further participation in an open -label extension 
Study  PTC923 -MD-004-PKU.  
3.1.3.  Part 2, Randomized Double -Blind Treatment Period (42 Days) 
All eligible subjects ≥2 years of age will be randomized to receive either PTC923 or placebo for 
42 days (ie,  6 weeks) in Part 2, the randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind treatment 
period.  
Subjects will be stratified based on their mean percent blood Phe reduction  in Part 1 (mean 
% reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥15% to <30% and mean % reduction in bloo d Phe levels of 
≥30%) and evenly distributed across both treatment arms (PTC923 or placebo). Additionally, 
subjects will be stratified based on their baseline blood Phe concentration (ie, subjects with 
baseline blood Phe <600 µmol/L and subjects with basel ine blood Phe ≥600  µmol/L) and evenly 
distributed to either PTC923 or placebo. This portion of the study is double -blinded. Subjects 
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 35 of 92 will continue their usual diet without modification and will maintain 3 -day diet records 
(one corresponding to each week of  Part 2). A dietician will monitor each subject’s diet to 
calculate total protein and corresponding Phe consumption, to have regular contact with subjects, 
and to reinforce the need for subjects to maintain their usual diet without modification.  
Subjects randomized to PTC923 will receive PTC923 20  mg/kg daily for Days 1 to 14 
(ie, Weeks 1 and 2), then PTC923 40 mg/kg daily for Days 15 to 28 (ie, Weeks 3 and 4), then 
PTC923 60 mg/kg daily for Days 29 to 42 (ie, Weeks 5 and 6). As dosing is weight -based and to 
maintain the blind, subjects randomized to  placebo will receive equivalent quantities of placebo 
to match the 20 to 40 to 60 mg/kg dose escalation  used with those randomized to  PTC923.  
On Part 2 Day 1, subjects will take their dose of study drug (PTC923  20 mg/kg or placebo) 
in-clinic ; for all other dosing days, subjects will take their dose  at home  and prior to coming to 
the clinic when visits are scheduled. All visits will be outpatient visits or virtual visits. Study 
visits will occur on Part 2 Day 1, Part 2 Day 14 (in -clinic visit for PK substudy only), Part 2 Day 
28 (in -clinic visit for PK substudy population) , and Part  2 Day  42 to conduct study evaluations, 
collect 3 -day diet records , and capture any AEs and concomitant medications.  
On Part 2 Day 1 (predose), the Phenylketonuria -quality of life (PKU -QOL) (Parent PKU -QOL 
[6 to 8 years]; Child PKU -QOL [9 to 11 years]; Adolescent PKU -QOL [12 to 17 years]; 
Adult  PKU -QOL  [≥18  years]) will be conducted using the tool in one of the following validated 
langu ages: English (British or American ), Turkish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, 
or French. Conduct of the PKU -QOL will not be required for subjects whose primary language is 
not one of the available validated languages.  On Part 2 Day 1 (predose) , the European Quality of 
Life - 5 Dimensions ( EQ-5D) ( European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions for Youth [ EQ-5D-Y] 
Proxy Version 1 [3 to 7 years]; EQ -5D-Y [8 to 15 years]; and 5 -Level European Quality of 
Life - 5 Dimensions ( EQ-5D-5L) [≥16 years]) will be conducted.  
Blood Phe  levels  will be measured in Part 2 on Days -1, 1 (predose) , 5, 10, 14, 19, 24, 28, 33, 38, 
and 4 2. Samples  will be collected after fasting or no earlier than 3 hours postprandial at 
approximately the same time of day at each collection  timepoint.  
Subjects participating in  the PK substudy:  Blood samples (2 samples/occasion) will be 
collected from subjects in Part 2 on Days 1, 14, 28, and 42 visits to characterize the PK of 
sepiapterin and BH 4 at predose (approximately 24  hours  post the dose o n prior day, except for 
Day 1  and prior to the dose of the day ) and 4 hours postdose.  
3.1.4.  End of Stud y 
For subjects <2 years of age, End of Study is defined as  their final visit in Part 1 and should 
occur on/between Part 1 Day 28 and Part 1 Day 35. All subjects <2 years of age who experience 
a ≥15% reduction in blood Phe levels during Part 1 will be offered the option to enroll directly 
into an open -label extension Study PTC923 -MD-004-PKU . 
For subjects ≥2 years of age who complete Part 2, End of Study is  defined as their final study 
visit on Part  2 Day 42. All subjects who complete Part 2 will be given the opportunity to 
continue treatment in the PTC923 Open -Label Extension Study, PTC923 -MD-004-PKU.  
Enrollment will continue until 80 subjects  are randomized into the stratum of ≥30% blood Phe 
reduction PTC923 -responsive subjects . The end of study is defined as the date of the last visit of 
the last subject in the study globally .

30 (±3) days after the last dose of study drug to assess for SAEs . 
Note: If any unscheduled visits are performed  when eGFR calculation is desired , alongside any assessments/procedures considered appropriate by the 
Investigator (or designee), subjects <18  years of age should have their height  and serum creatinine  measured  and subjects ≥18years of age  should have their 
serum creatinine measured .

V5.0 PTC Therapeutics . - Confidential  Page 43 of 92 3.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 80 subjects with PKU  aged ≥2 years  who achieve a ≥30% reduction from 
baseline in blood Phe levels during the responsiveness test (Part 1) will be enrolled in the 
placebo -controlled treatment period to receive either PTC923 or placebo (Part 2). Approximately 
178 subjects are expected to be enrolled in Part 1 of the study to achieve this.  
3.3. Treatmen t Assignment  
3.3.1.  Part 1, Open -Label Responsiveness Test  
All subjects will receive PTC923 (7.5 mg/kg for subjects 0 to < 6 months  of age,  15 mg/kg for 
subjects 6 to <12 months  of age , 30 mg/kg for subjects 12 months to <2 years  of age , and 
60 mg/kg for subjects ≥2 years  of age ) for 14  days starting on Day 1.  
3.3.2.  Part 2, Randomized Double -Blind Treatment Period  
Eligible s ubjects  will be randomized to receive either PTC923 or placebo for 42 days (6  weeks). 
Subjects randomized to the PTC923 treatment arm will receive PT C923 20  mg/kg daily for 
Days  1 to 14 (ie, Weeks 1 and 2), then PTC923 40 mg/kg daily for Days 15 to 28 (ie, Weeks 3 
and 4), then PTC923 60  mg/kg daily for Days 29 to 42 (ie, Weeks 5 and 6). As dosing is 
weight -based and to maintain the blind, subjects randomized to  placebo will receive equivalent 
quantities of placebo to match the 20 to 40 to 60 mg/kg dose escalation of those randomized to  
PTC923.  
3.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
PTC923 is a powder for oral use and dosing is weight based.  
Given that PTC923 is pack aged in sachets with 2 different dosage strengths, 250  mg and 
1000  mg, weight bands will be utilized to determine the sachet size and number required for each 
subject’s dose ( Section  6.5). 
During Part 1, all subjects will be administered PTC923 orally once a day for 14  days to assess 
responsiveness ; no change of the dose is allowed in this period.  
During Part 2, subjects  rando mized to  PTC923 will undergo a forced dose escalation by 
receiving PTC923 20 mg/kg daily for Weeks 1 and 2, then PTC923 40 mg/kg daily for Weeks 3 
and 4, then PTC923 60 mg/kg daily for Weeks 5 and 6. Given the short duration of each dose 
level, deviation ( ie, dose adjustments) from the prescribed dose levels and dose escalation will 
not be permitted in this study.  
3.4.1.  Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping Doses  
As dose adjustments outside of the prescribed dose escalation scheme are not permitted, any 
adjustments to or stopping doses of study drug administration would result from concern by the 
investigator for the safety of the subject. Safety criteria for permanent  discontinuation of study 
drug is discussed in Section  4.4. If a subject temporarily stops treatment at the occurrence of an 
AE, the subject may return to a previous dose if the investigator and medical  monitor feel this is 
appropriate.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics . - Confidential  Page 44 of 92 Given the requirement for pregnancy testing in women  of childbearing potential  at Screening and 
the requirements for highly effective methods of contraception during the study, it is unlikely 
that pregnancies will occur during study conduct. However, study drug will be discontinued 
should suspected  or confirmed  pregnancy or suspected or confirmed nursing during the study 
drug administration period occur.  
3.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated if significant violations of GCP that compromise the ability to 
achieve the study objectives or compromise subject safety are observed at any time during the 
study. With regard to safety, the study may be temporarily suspended o r terminated should the 
investigator,  PTC, or Institutional Review Board  (IRB) /Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
determine that the safety of study participants is significantly jeopardized. The decision for a 
temporary or permanent study hold will depend  on the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs 
that were observed in all enrolled subjects to date. In a temporary study hold, no additional 
subjects will be enrolled into the study or dosed with study drug until the study team members 
(including the investigator and the medical monitor) decide it is safe to proceed with the study.  
PTC reserves the right to discontinue the study prior to inclusion of the intended number of 
subjects. The investigator, after consultation with the medical monitor, reserves the  right to 
discontinue the study at the investigator site for safety reasons at any time.  
After a decision to terminate the study, investigators must contact all subjects who are continuing 
their participation in the study and must do so within a time perio d set by PTC. As directed by 
PTC, all study materials must be collected, and all electronic data entry forms completed to the 
greatest extent possible.

window prior to enrollment  will be considered a screen failure. Screening and enrollment  should 
occur within a 45-day period. Screen failures will be captured in the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system. Screen failures can be rescreened after consultation with the medical monitor.  
4.4. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
4.4.1.  Discontinuation from Study Drug Administration  
Premature discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as the discontinuation of study 
drug for an individual subject  before the required full course of study drug is completed. Reasons 
for premature discontinuation from study drug administration should be recorded on the 
appropriate page(s) of the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) and may include, but are not 
limited t o the following:  
• Occurrence of an AE, SAE, or clinically significan t laboratory abnormality that, in 
the opinion of the investigator, warrants the subject ’s perm anent discontinuation from 
study drug administration  
• In the judgment of the investigator, the subject  experiences a general or specific 
change(s) that renders the subject  unsuitable for continued study drug administration  
• There is a need for concomitant medication that makes the subject  ineligible for 
further study drug administration  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics . - Confidential  Page 48 of 92 Adult subject s (ie, ≥18 years)  who discontinue from treatment but who do not discontinue from 
the study will be instructed to maintain adherence to the study schedule of assessments , 
including all planned safety and efficacy assessments , in the aim of minimizing the risk of 
missing data  (Table  2). After completion of these assessments, the subject should  revert to their 
prestudy SoC to treat PKU (at the discretion of the investigator or the subject’s physician).  
Pediatric subjects (ie , <18 years  of age ) who discontinue from treatment will not be instructed to 
maintain adherence to the study schedule of assessments but  should revert to their prestudy SoC 
to treat PKU (at the discretion of the investigator or the subject’s physician).  In addition, a phone 
follow -up visit will occur 30  (±3) days after the last dose of study drug to assess for SAEs.  
4.4.2.  Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from  the Study  
Subjects  may withdraw from the study for any reason or be withdrawn at the request of the  
investigator or sponsor. The reason for a subject ’s withdrawal must be recorded on the  
appropriate page(s) of the eCRF. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not 
limited to:  
• Withdrawal of consen t and/or assent (as applicable)  
• AEs or SAEs  
• Significant subject  noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the 
protocol requirements  
• The investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the subject  to withdraw 
from study participation  
Each subject  who withdraws from t he study after receipt of any amount of study drug will be 
asked to undergo the ETV  assessments. However,  subjects  may withdraw consent to participate 
in this study at any time without penalty. Withdrawn subjects  will not be replaced.  
4.5. Lost to Follow -Up 
A subject is considered lost to follow -up if he or she does not complete the study and attempts to 
contact the subject are unsuccessful. Efforts must be made on the part of the site to avoid any 
subject being lost to follow -up during the study. Before any su bject is considered lost to 
follow -up, a minimum of 2 documented telephone contact attempts and 1 certified letter within a 
week of the most recent planned study assessment must be sent in efforts to contact the subject. 
After being considered lost to foll ow-up, a subject’s status may be changed if the subject makes 
contact at a later time , provided that the study  is ongoing.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics . - Confidential  Page 49 of 92 5. TREATMENT OF SUBJECT S 
5.1. Description of Study Drug  
PTC923 is a new chemical entity and synthetic form of sepiapterin. Sepiapterin is (S)-2-amino -6-
(2-hydroxypropanoyl) -7,8-dihydropteridin -4(3H) -one with a molecular weight of 237.22 g/mol 
and a molecular formula of C 9H11 N5O3. 
PTC923 Powder for Oral Use is a powder for oral use with a yellow to orange colour. PTC923 
Powder for Oral Use will be suspended in water or apple juice prior to administration . Additional 
details on the study drug are included in Section  6. 
5.2. Selection and Timin g of Dose for Each Subject  
PTC923 will be dispensed at Part 1 Day 1 and Part 2 Day 1  in-clinic visit s. The first dose in each 
treatment period will be taken in the clinic with a meal; for all other dosing days, subjects will 
take their morning dose as an outpatient with a meal.  
For subjects participating in the PK substudy,  if an in -clinic visit is scheduled for PK blood 
sampling, doses will be administered in-clinic with a meal . 
5.3. Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant use of any  drugs known to inhibit folate synthesis (eg, methotrexate, pemetrexed, 
and trimetrexate) , pegvaliase -pqpz , BH 4 (eg, sapropterin dihydrochloride , KUVAN ), or any 
investigational therapy  will not be permitted.  
Any treatments (including nutritional supplements) and over -the-counter medications (including 
herbal medications ) taken by a subject 30 days prior to the Screening Visit  and during the course 
of the study and the reason for use of the medication will be recorded on the eCRF. Additionally, 
specific information related to previous use of sapropterin or pegvaliase -pqpz should be collected 
(ie, details on duration, dose, if d iscontinued, the reason [s] why, and if a subject is known to be 
BH 4-responsive).  During Screening, each subject will be instructed to report the use of any 
medication to the investigator. Subjects will also be instructed about the importance of not taking 
any medication throughout the study (including over -the-counter medications) without 
consulting the investigator.  
COVID -19 vaccination is permitted during the study and subjects are encouraged to be 
vaccinated according to local guidelines. Given the mode of action of PTC923, it is considered 
unlikely there would be an interaction/immune response between PTC923 and the COVID -19 
vaccination. Vaccination should be reported to the investigator in -line with standard concomitant 
medication reporting.  
5.4. Total Blood  Volume  
The total volume  of blood that will be collected from each subject  for Screening,  Part 1 , and 
Part 2 of the study is presented  in Table  3, Table  4, and Table  5, respectively.  Blood volumes 
taken are in accordance with current guidance that  recommends a blood draw limit of 1% of total 
blood volume corresponding to  a single time point and 3% of total blood volume during a period 
of four weeks  (European  Parlia ment 2008 ). Total blood volume is estimated to be 80  to 
90 mL/kg body weight (100 mL/kg body weight for neonates).  Subjects of all ages are permitted 
for inclusion into this study . Based on growth charts for newborn s, 5% to 95% of boys weigh 2.6 
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics . - Confidential  Page 50 of 92 to 4.2 kg and girls weigh 2.5 to 4.0 kg (CDC 2010a , CDC 2010b ). Accordingly, the maximum 
total blood volume permitted for newborns would be 2.5 mL  at a single time and 7.5 mL over  
4 weeks.  Based on growth charts for subject s 2 years  old, 5% to 95% of boys weigh 10.6 to 
15.2 kg and girls weigh 10.2 to 14.6 kg (CDC 2010a , CDC 2010b ). Accordingly, the maximum 
total blood volume permitted for subjects 2 years old  would be 8.2 mL at a single time and 
24.5 mL over 4 weeks. To adhere to the guidance, three groups are represented with 
corresponding blood volumes in Table  3 and Table  4. Table  5 only includes 2 groups as only 
subjects ≥2 years of age will participate in Part 2 of the study . 
Screening, consisting of the Screening visit and Supplementation Washout Period, may last up to 
45 days  (6 weeks) . If a subject weighs less than 4 .5kg and PAH  genotyping is required, then 
PAH  genotyping should be performed on a separate day from  the collection of blood chemistry, 
hematology , vitamin B12/iron , and blood Phe/Tyr levels.

5.5. Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will be dispensed on Day 1 of each treatment period. Subjects will be instructed to 
return all used (empty ) and unused study drug sachets at each scheduled study visit  after Part 1 
Day 1 . Compliance with the dosing regimen will be assessed by reconciliation of used and 
unused study drug. The quantities dispensed, returned, used, and lost will be recorded on the 
dispensing log provided for the study.  
5.6. Randomization and Blinding  
In Part 1 of  the study , all subjects will receive open -label  treatment with PTC923 administered 
orally once a day .  
Following the minimum 14 -day PTC923 washout period, all eligible subjects will proceed to 
Part 2 and be randomized to receive either PTC923 or placebo.  
Part 2 of  this study will be  performed in a double -blind ed fashion. The investigator and study 
staff (including processing lab oratory  personnel), the subjects, and the sponsor’s staff will 
remain blinded to the treatment until study closure. The investigat ional drug and its matching 
placebo are indistinguishable and will be packaged in the same way.  Subjects will be randomized 
1:1 to either PTC 923 or placebo using a central randomization process. The randomization will 
be stratified based on their mean percent reduction in blood Phe levels (ie, subjects with mean % 
reduction in Phe levels of ≥15% to <30% and subjects with mean % reduction in Phe levels of 
≥30%) and evenly distributed to either PTC923 or placebo treatment arms.  Additionally, subjects 
will be stratified based on their baseline blood Phe concentration (ie, subjects with baseline 
blood Phe <600 µmol/L and subjects with baseline blood Phe ≥600 µmol/L) and evenly 
distributed to either PTC923 or placebo treatment arms.  
Subjects who are unblinded cou ld potentially remain in the study, per principal investigator  (PI) 
discretion and based on discussions with medical monitor as needed.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics . - Confidential  Page 52 of 92 5.6.1.  Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
Randomization is an accepted means to reduce bias and allows for the highest standard of 
evidence in documenting a treatment effect. The block randomization technique will be used. 
The process will be established and performed centrally by an experienced C ontract Research 
Organization (CRO) through an Interactive Response Technology ( IRT) system to maximize the 
integrity and security of the randomization and ensure appropriate access and 
convenience -of -use by the investigational sites.  
Blinding is importan t for validity of this clinical study: however, the blind may be broken in the 
event of a medical emergency, in which knowledge of the study drug identity is critical to the 
management of the subject’s course of treatment. Before breaking the blind, the investigator 
should determine that the information is necessary (ie, that it will alter the subject’s immediate 
course of treatment). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not study -drug 
related , the problem may be effectively managed by  assuming that the subject is receiving an 
active study drug without the need for unblinding.  If deemed necessary to break the blind for a 
study subject, the investigator has the final decision and unilateral right to break the blind and 
should notify the PTC medical monitor as soon as possible after breaking the blind for a subject.  
To identify a subject’s study drug, the investigator or designee must electronically contact the 
IRT system to identify a subject’s study drug assignment. Record the date of un blinding, the 
reason for unblinding , and the initials of the investigational center staff member who performed 
the unblinding on the subject’s study file.  
Subjects who are unblinded could potentially remain in the study, per PI discretion and based on 
discussions with medical monitor as needed.  
Instructions for use of the IRT system will be provided to each investigator prior to the initiation 
of subject enrollment at her/his center.

V5.0 PTC Therapeutics . - Confidential  Page 54 of 92 6.5. Study Drug Preparation  
As dosing is weight -based, subjects will receive kits containing the required number of sachets 
for each 2 -week period. Study drug will be provided to each subject based on  their current/most 
recent weight , age,  and randomization sequence (as applicable)  such that subjects will be 
informed about how many sachets to use for each dose (eg, 3 large sachets and 1 small sachet, or 
2 large sachets and 3 small sachets).  
PTC923  Powder for Oral Use  is provided as 250 mg and 1000 mg sachets. The calculated daily 
dose on body weight should be rounded to the nearest multiple of 250 mg or 1000 mg, as 
appropriate. For instance, a calculated dose of 1251 to 137 4 mg should be rounded down t o 
1250  mg corresponding to 1 ×250 mg sachet and 1 ×1000 mg sachet.  A calculated dose of 137 5 to 
1499  mg should be rounded up to 1500 mg correspon ding to 2 ×250 mg sachets and 1 ×1000 mg 
sachet.  
The full contents of a single 250 mg or 1000 mg sachet may be suspended in 10 mL or 20 mL of 
water  or apple juice , respectively. Once added, the combination should be shaken or stirred for at 
least 30  seconds to form the suspension. After mixture, all of t he resulting suspension or an 
appropriate quantity of the resulting suspension depending on the weight of the individual should 
be measured and administered PO to the subject immediately. Dosing is weight based on 1 mg of 
PTC923 per kg of subject basis.  
Subjects will be in structed to open their study drug kit and remove the required numbe r of 
sachets when preparing their  daily dose.  
For subjects ≥2 years of age weighing  ≤18 kg administering  20 mg/kg dose  
For s ubjects  ≥2 years of age  weighing ≤18 kg, PTC923 Powder for Oral Use  should  be 
suspended  in 9 mL of water  or apple juice  per 250 mg sachet and a n aliquot  of this s uspension 
corresponding to a 20 mg/kg  dose may be administered orally via an oral dosing syring e. Table  6 
provides dosing information  for subjec ts at 20 mg/kg doses.  A graduated dosing syringe will be 
provided for subjects weighing ≤18 kg for this dose .

During Part 1, all subjects will receive PTC923 administered orally once a day for 14 days.  
During Part 2, subjects in the PTC923 treatment arm will receive PTC923 20  mg/kg for Weeks 1 
and 2, t hen PTC923 40  mg/kg for Weeks 3 and 4, then PTC923 60 mg/kg for Weeks 5 and 6. As 
dosing is weight -based and to maintain the blind, subjects in the placebo arm will receive 
equivalent quantities of placebo to match the 20 to 40 to 60 mg/kg dose escalation of the 
PTC923 treatment arm.  
All doses will be administered orally, once a day with food  and are weight based . Subjects will 
be instructed to administer each dose immediately upon reconstitution of the powder into a 
suspension  by drinking the entire conten ts of the suspension. Subjects will be instructed to rinse 
the glass with additional water or apple juice and drink th e rinse to ensure that the full dose ha s 
been administered. In the case of subjects who weigh  ≤18 kg or 15 kg (dose level -dependent), 
the volume administered will be prescribed and administration will be completed via a dosing 
syringe  (Section  6.5).  
If a subject vomits after taking a do se of study drug, this should be recorded  as an AE  and the 
subject should wait until the next scheduled timepoint to administer a dose. A missed dose 
should be taken as soon as possible, but 2 doses should not be taken on the same day.  
6.7. Study Drug Accountab ility 
All drug product required for completion of this study will be provided by  PTC. It is the 
responsibility of the pharmacy staff or study staff to ensure that a current record of drug 
inventory and drug accountability is maintained. Inventory and PTC92 3 accountability records 
must be readily available for inspection by the study monitor and are open to inspection at any 
time by applicable regulatory authorities.  
6.8. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
Used and unused clinical supplies must be returned to PTC or its designee after the study is 
completed. If the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) at any site states that the drug cannot be 
returned and must be disposed of onsite, PTC must review the SOP of  that site prior to any final 
disposition done by site. Records documenting the date of study drug destruction or shipping, 
and amount destroyed or shipped should be kept.

7.1. Primary Efficacy: Phenylalanine  Concentrations  
The ACMG guide lines recommend lifelong treatment of PKU, with the primary goal of therapy 
to lower blood Phe to the range of 120 to 360 μmol/L (Vockley 2014 ). As such, blood Phe levels 
are universally used in the diagnosis and clinical management of patients with HPA due to PKU.  
The reliability of blood Phe levels as a predictive biomarker of clinical outcomes in the 
development of treatments for PKU was assessed in a systematic literature review and 
meta -analysis of published trials of PKU, which included Phe level and neurological and dietary 
compliance outcome measures. Within -study correlations betw een Phe level and IQ were 
extracted from 40 studies. Significant, proportional correlations were found during critical 
periods (from 0 to 12  years of age) for early -treated patients with PKU (r= -0.35; 95% CI: -0.44 
to -0.27), where each 100 µmol/L increase  in Phe predicted a 1.3 - to 3.1 -point reduction in IQ. 
Similar significant correlations were observed between IQ and mean lifetime Phe level for 
early -treated patients (r=0.34; 95% CI: -0.42 to -0.25), where each 100 µmol/L increase in Phe 
predicted a 1.9 - to 4.1 -point reduction in IQ. Moderate correlations were found between 
concurrent Phe level and IQ for early -treated patients. In conclusion, these results confirm a 
significant correlation between blood Phe level and IQ in patients with PKU and support t he use 
of Phe as a predictive biomarker for IQ in clinical trials (Waisbren 2007 ). 
Furthermore, there is clinical and regulatory precedent for the use of this surrogate clinical 
efficacy endpoint, which was accepted for both K UVAN  and P ALYNZI Q in global marketing 
authorizations  (Levy 2007 , Harding 2018 , Thomas 2018 ). 
The primary  efficacy endpoint evaluates the absolute reduction in Phe levels at the optimal dose 
of PTC923. Using the average over a 2 -week period reduces the impact of variations between 
weeks. It is well established that blood Phe decreases during the day, with the  highest blood Phe 
levels presenting early in the morning following an overnight fast  (van Wegberg 2017 ).  
Blood collection, pro cessing, and shipping information will be provided in a laboratory manual.  
Blood Phe levels  will be measured at the timepoints indicated in  Table  12 and Table  13. Samples 
should be collected after fasting or no earlier than 3  hours postprandial and at approximately the 
same time of day at each collection timepoint.  Samples collected on Day -1 and Day 1 (predose)  
for Part 1 and Part 2  of each treatment period should be collected predose.  At other timepoints, 
samples can be collect ed pre -or post -dose.  
Samples for b lood Phe level s measurement  will be collecte d while  the subject is either in the 
clinic or at home , depending on whether the subject has a scheduled clinic visit . Dried blood 
sample s obtained at home will be shipped to the study site . Samples will be collected using the 
VAMS technology by utilizing the Mitra microsampling devices provided by Neoteryx (CA, 
USA) and blood Phe level will be measured using a n HPLC/MS/MS method. The method has 
been validated. Dr ied blood VAMS provides convenience to the subjects, allowing blood 
samples (20  µL per sample) to be collected at home, without clinical visits, and samples are 
shipped at room temperature.  When subjects provide samples in clinic , site staff can provide 
additional training on the sampling technique if considered necessary or requested.  Analysis of 
the blood  Phe value  from Screening  can be performed at the site’s local laboratory.

Demographic data will include age, gender, and self -reported race/ethnicity.  
8.1.2.  Vital Signs , Weight,  and Height  
Vital signs assessments will include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature . 
Vital signs should be obtained prior to collection of any laboratory samples (including Phe). If 
feasible, s ubjects will  rest for 5 minutes in a supi ne position before vital signs are assessed.  
Vital signs will be collected at the Screening Visit, Part 1 Day 1 , Part 2 Day s 1 and 42, and E TV 
(if applicable) . Vital signs will be collected both predose  and 2  hours postdose on Part  1 Day 1 
and Part 2 Day 1; for all other timepoints, they will be taken at any time during the visit  prior to 
laboratory  sampling . 
Weight will be collected at  the Screening Visit,  Part 1 Day 1 , Part 2  Days 1 and 42, and ETV (if 
applicable) . Measurements to be completed prior to initial dosing for Part 1 Day 1 and Part 2 
Day 1. Weight can be measured at any time during the other visits.   
Height will be collected at the Screening Visit.  Additionally , for subjects <18 years of age, 
height should  be measured at Part 2 Day  42 (EOS ) Visit and  at any Unscheduled Visits  when 
eGFR calculation is desired . 
Permitted time windows are presented in  Table  2 and Table  17 (PK sampling d ays). 
8.1.3.  Physical Examination  
A full physical examination will be performed  predose at the Screening  Visit , Part 1 Day 1, 
Part 2 Days 1 and 42, and ETV (if applicable) . General appearance, dermatologic, HEENT, 
lymphatic, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological , and skin  
parameters  will be assessed .

Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 63 of 92 8.1.4.  Electrocardiogram  
Twelve -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be obtained before any other study -related 
procedures are performed . If feasible, ECGs will be performed  after a 5 -minute rest in the supine 
position.  Twelve -lead ECGs are to be performed at Part 1 Day 1 (predose)  for all sub jects and at 
the ETV (if applicable) . Additional 12 -led ECGs will be performed for all subjects participating 
in the PK substudy at Part 1 Day 1 at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours postdose. Electrocardiograms  will be 
performed in triplicate, with each read taken at least 1 minute apart .  
Permitted time windows are presented in  Table  2 and Table  18 (PK sampling day s). 
The following parameters will be collected and recorded in the eCRF: RR interval, PR interval,  
QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc interval. In addition, the tracing should be reported as  
normal, abnormal clinically significant, or abnormal not clinically significant. If  abnormalities 
are noted on the ECG, these should be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.1.5.  Laboratory Assessments  
Blood and urine samples for clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis will be collected at 
the timepoints in Table  1 and Table  2. Subjects should be fasted prior to collection of samples 
(minimum of 4 hours for subjects < 6 years and minimum of 8 hours  for subjects ≥6 years  prior to 
sample collection). Serum and urine pregnancy tests are required for all women of childbearing 
potential ; serum testing to occur during the initial Screening Visit and urine testin g to occur 
during all other in -clinic visits. Any positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test  performed at the site’s local laboratory . 
Laboratory parameters that will be assessed will include, but not be limited to : 
• Hematology: hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, red blood cell count (RBC) , 
white blood cell count ( WBC ), and WBC differential  
• Clinical chemistry: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase , B12, blood urea nitr ogen, calcium, CO 2, chloride, direct bilirubin 
gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase, glucose, iron, lactate dehydrogenase, phosph ate, 
potassium, serum creatinine, sodium, total  bilirubin,  direct  bilirubin, total cholesterol, 
total protein, and uric acid  
• Urinalysi s: bilirubin, glucose, ketones, occult blood, pH, protein, specific gravity, 
urobilinogen, microscopic examination of WBC, RBC, and epithelial cells  
• Pregnancy testing: serum human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) (at Screening), urine 
hCG (at Screening and Part 2 Day 1)  
Additionally:  
• at the EOS Visit, eGFR should be calculated  (all subjects) . 
• at an y Unscheduled Visits in which eGFR calculation is desired  serum creatinine 
should be measured.

Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 64 of 92 8.1.6.  Laboratory  Abnormalities  
Laboratory values will be collected through out the study to assess for safety. The investigator 
must review and assess all laboratory results in a timely manner and determine whether the 
abnormal laboratory values, if any, are clinically significant or not clinically significant and 
whether there a re associated signs and symptoms. The investigator must make the determination 
whether the clinically significant abnormal laboratory values are AEs.  An abnormal laboratory 
finding in absence of any other signs or symptoms is not necessarily an AE. If the abnormal 
laboratory finding is accompanied by signs or symptoms, report the signs and symptoms as the 
AE in lieu of the abnormal laboratory value.  If a diagnosis is available, report the diagnosis. 
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities after taki ng study medication that reflect a 
meaningful change from the screening value(s) and that require active management are to be 
considered by the investigator as AEs (eg, abnormalities that require study treatment dose 
modification, discontinuation, more fre quent follow -up assessments, etc) . 
8.1.7.  Diet Monitoring: 3-Day Diet Records  
Subjects will be instruc ted to continue their usual diet without modification (ie , no change in 
daily Phe consumption). Subjects will maintain 3 -day diet records during the study as ind icated 
in Table  1 and Table  2. The 3 -day diet records will be completed over 3 consecutive days within 
each period  and collected w eekly . At each in -clinic visit, a  dietician will monitor each subject’s 
diet to calculate Phe consumption and to have regular contact with the subjects. The total Phe 
consumption during the 3 -day period will be calculated by the dieti cian and entered in the eCRF.   
8.1.8.  Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Pharmacokinetic  sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be performed 
according to instructions outlined in the PK laboratory manual separate from this protocol.  
Additionally, for subjects participating in the PK substudy,  blood Phe and Tyr samples will be 
collected at all timepoints from the PK samples, prior to plasma harvesting in Part 1. After the 
blood samples are withdrawn, the blood will be applied to the VAMS device for Phe and Tyr 
collection and analysis (ie, no additional finger prick will be required for collection of these 
samples).  Sepiapterin and BH 4 plasma concentrations will be determined by Syneos Health , 
using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters include C max, Tmax, T1/2, area under the plasma concentration -time 
curve from time zero to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24h), area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
from time zero to infinity ( AUC 0-inf), CL/F, and Vz/F.  
Table  19 and Table  20 in Appendix  A present sampling times and permitted windows.  
8.1.8.1.  Part 1  
Blood samples (at least 1 mL ; duplicate samples should be taken at each timepoint ) will be 
collected from a subset of subjects to character ize the PK of sepiapterin and BH 4.  
Approximately 30 subjects age d ≥12 years  will participate in the PK substudy. At least 12 out of 
the 30 subjects of age ≥12 years participating in the PK substudy will be female. In addition, up 
to 6 subjects from  these  age groups  will be included : 1) <2 years ; 2) 2 to 5  years ; and 3) 6 to 
11 years.

For subjects aged ≥2 years:  
• Part 1 Day 1: Predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h ours postdose  
8.1.8.2.  Part 2  
Sparse blood samples (at least 1 mL; duplicate samples should be taken at each timepoint) will 
be collected from a subset of subjects to characterize the PK of sepiapterin and BH 4. To achieve 
sparse sampling from 3 0 subjects in Part 2, this subset of subjects will consist of those who 
participated in the Part 1 PK substudy and continued into Part  2 and also additional subjects who 
did not participate in the Part 1 PK substudy.  Samples will be collected at the follow ing 
timepoints:  
• Part 2 Day s 1, 14, 28, and 42 : Predose  and 4 hours postdose  
8.1.9.  PAH  Genotype Testing  
PAH  genotyp e testing will not be required for inclusion/exclusion; however, all subjects will 
undergo genotyping during screening , unless documented in their medical history , and these data 
will be collected for analysis.  
8.1.10.  Quality of Life Baseline Assessments  
Testing will be performed at Part 2 Day 1  (predose ). The following tests will be performed:  
• PKU -QOL : Parent PKU -QOL  (6 to 8 yea rs), Child PKU -QOL (9 to 11 years ), 
Adolescent PKU -QOL (12 to 17 years ), and Adult PKU -QOL (≥18 years)  to be 
conducted using the tool in one of the following validated languages: English 
(British  or American ), Turkish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or 
French. Conduct of the PKU -QOL will not be required for subjects whose primary 
language is not one of the available validated languages.  
• EQ-5D: EQ -5D-Y Proxy Version 1 (3 to 7 years); EQ -5D-Y (8 to 15 years); and 
EQ-5D-5L (≥16 years)  
8.1.10.1.  Phenylk etonuria Quality of Life  Questionnaire  
In this study, a PKU -specific version of the quality of life ( QOL ) questionnaire will be used. 
Four  versions of the PKU -QOL will be used : parent ( ages 6 to 8 years  old, 54 items ), child (9  to 
11 years old , 40 items ), adolescent (12  to 17 years old , 58 items), and adult (≥18 years, 
65 items).  Each version is available in one of the following validated languages: English 
(British  or American ), Turkish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, or French. Conduct 
of the PKU -QOL will not be required for subjects whose primary language is not one of the 
available validated languages.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 66 of 92 Phenylketonuria quality of life questionnaires  comprise of 4 modul es: 1) PKU symptoms, 
2) PKU in  general, 3) administration of Phe -free protein supplements,  and 4) dietary protein 
restriction. The recall period focused on the past 1 week for all sections  except for ‘patient ’s 
general feeling’ where the recall period was ‘in  general’. The following interpretation rules were 
applied for all  doma in scores in a range from 0 to 100: for symptom scores, a  higher score is 
associated with more frequent symptoms ; for adherence scores, a higher score is associated with 
a poorer  adherence ; for other scores, a higher score is associated with a  greater impact (Alptekin 
2018 ). 
8.1.10.2.  European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions  
In this study, 3 versions of the EQ -5D will be used: EQ -5D-Y Proxy Version 1 (3 to 7 years) , 
EQ-5D-Y (8 to 15 years) , and  EQ-5D-5L (≥16 years).  
For subjects aged ≥16 years, the EQ -5D-5L will be used. For the EQ -5D-5L, subjects will rate 
their own health on each dimension, with each dimension having 5 levels of severity.  
Dimensions include mobility, self-care, usual activities , pain/discomfort , and  anxiety/depression.   
For children/ adolescents  aged 8 to  15 years, the  EQ-5D-Y will be used. This  is a child -friendly 
version of the EQ -5D-5L. Dimensions include mobility, looking after myself, doing usual 
activities, having pain or discomfort, and feeling worried, sad , or happy.  The younger subject 
will be  asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate 
statement in each of the 5 dimensions. The i nstructions and wording are more suitable for 
children and adolescents.  
For children aged 3 to 7 years, a proxy version of the EQ -5D-Y will be used. This is for use 
when children or adolescents are mentally or physically incapable of reporting on their own 
health -related QOL. For a proxy version, a caregiver who knows the child or adolescent well will 
rate the health  related QOL in their opinion.  
8.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
8.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward  medical occurrence associated with the use  of a drug in humans , whether 
or not it is considered related to the drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease in a study 
subject who is administered with study drug in this study.  
For this protocol, untoward medic al occurrences that should be reported as AEs include the 
following:  
• All AEs during the course of treatment with study drug administration  
• All AEs resulting from medication misuse, abuse, withdrawal, or overdose, of study 
drug 
• All AEs resulting from medica tion errors , such as dispensing or administration error 
outside of what is described in the protocol  
• Apparent unrelated illnesses, including worsening of a pre -existing illness  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 67 of 92 • Injury or accidents. Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused t he 
injury or accident (a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) 
and the accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate AEs. The outcome of the 
accident (hip fracture secondary to the fall) should be recorded in source documents.  
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] 
test) 
• Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further invest igation 
(beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they are associated with an 
already reported clinical event. Laboratory abnormalities associated with a clinical 
event should be captured in the source documents. Laboratory abnormalities not 
requiring clinical intervention or further investigation will be captured as part of 
overall laboratory monitoring and should not be reported as AEs.  
• Pre-existing condition (eg, allergic rhinitis) must be noted on the appropriate eCRF 
for screening but shoul d not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens or the 
episodes increase in frequency during the AE reporting period. Diagnostic and 
therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as AEs. However, the medi cal condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an 
acute appendicitis that occurs during the treatment with study drug should be reported 
as the AE, and the resulting appendectomy sho uld be recorded in the source 
documents and eCRF. If a surgical procedure was planned prior to entry into the 
study, and the surgery is not performed because of a worsening of a baseline 
condition, this should not be reported as an AE. Note that, as descri bed in 
Section  8.2.2 , any hospitalization occurring as the consequence of an AE during the 
study period should be reported as a n SAE.  
Each AE is to be classified as serious or non -serious by the investigator using medical and 
scientific judgment.  
8.2.2.  Definition of Serious Adverse Even ts 
An SAE is an untoward medical occurrence or effect associated with the use of a study drug at 
any dose, regardless of wheth er it is considered to be related to the study drug, which results in 
one of the following:  
• Result in d eath. This includes all deaths on treatment or within 30 days after last 
study drug administration, including deaths due to disease progression. Any deat h 
occurring later than 30 days following the last dose need not be reported as an SAE 
unless it is a result of an event that started within the period covered by the on -study 
definition. The reported AE should be the event that caused the death. In additio n, 
any AE resulting in death that occurs subsequently to the AE reporting period and 
that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the study drug should also be 
reported as serious.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 68 of 92 • Is life-threatening. This refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, hypothetically might have caused death.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (excluding 
hospitalization s for administration of the study drug, procedures required by the study 
protocol, or treatment -related diagnostic procedures; other planned hospitalizations; 
or hospitalizations related only to progression of disease). Emergency room visits that 
do not re quire admission to the hospital do not fall into this category , but the event 
may be serious due to another seriousness criterion.  
• Results in p ersistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal lif e functions.  
• Any other medically important event that the investigator or the sponsor judges to be 
serious or which is defined as serious by the regulatory agency in the local country. 
These are AEs that might not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or might require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Medical judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether an AE is serious based on above definition. Examples 
of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
• A pregnancy resulting in spontaneous abort ion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly (including that in an aborted fetus).  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
within 30 calendar days following the cessation of treatment, wheth er or not they are related to 
the study, must be recorded on forms provided by PTC . 
8.2.3.  Unexpected Adverse Events  
The Investigator’s Brochure contains the Reference Safety Information (RSI) , which will be used 
for assessing expectedness. If an event is not listed in the RSI, it should be considered 
unexpected ; if the AE occurs at a greater severity, specificity , or frequency, it should also be 
considered unexpected.  
8.2.4.  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the 
study subject/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally acceptable representative. In addition, each study 
subject/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally accepta ble representative will be questioned about AEs at 
each scheduled clinic visit after study drug administration or during any telephone contact with 
the subject/parent(s)/legal guardian/legally acceptable representative. The type of question asked 
should be  open -ended, for example, “ How have you been feeling ?” or a similar type of query.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 69 of 92 8.2.5.  Recordin g Non‑ Serious Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs (both serious and non -serious) that occur in subjects during the AE reporting period 
must be recorded , whether or not the event is considered drug related. In addition, any known 
untoward event that occurs subsequently to the AE reporting period that the investigator assesses 
as possibly related to the investigational drug/product should also be recorded as an AE.  
All AEs are to be recorded in the source documents and on the eCRF using concise medical 
terminology; whenever possible, terms contained in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) should be employed. In addition, the following i nformation should be 
recorded:  
• Indication of whether the event is serious or non -serious ( Section  8.2.2 ) 
• Relationship to study drug ( Section  8.2.6 ) 
• Severity of the event ( Section  8.2.7 ) 
• Onset date  
• Resolution date, or date of death  
• Action taken  
• Outcome of the event  
Classification of the event as serious or non -serious determines the reporting procedures to be 
followed.  
8.2.6.  Descri bing Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator should provide an assessment of the relationship of the AE to the study drug, 
ie, whether there is a reasonable possibili ty that the study drug caused the AE, using the 
considerations outlined in Table  14. 
Table  14: Relationship of Study Drug to A E Relationship  
Relationship  Description  
Probable  A clinical event in which a relationship to the study drug seems probable because of 
factors such as consistency with known effects of the drug , a clear temporal 
association with the use of the drug , improvement upon withdrawal of the drug , 
recurrence upon  re-challenge with the drug , and  lack of alternative explanations for the 
event.  
Possible  A clinical event occurring coincident with administration of the study drug and which 
may or may not be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals . 
Information on drug withdrawal or re -challenge may be lacking.  
Unlikely  A clinical event with a temporal relationship to the study drug exposure that does not 
preclude causality but for which there is a clear alternate cause that is more likely to 
have caused the adverse event than study drug. Such alternatives include a 
conco mitantly administered drug, the subject’s  disease state, other medical conditions, 
or environmental factors.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 70 of 92 Relationship  Description  
Unrelated  A clinical event  in which a relationship to the study drug seems improbable because of 
factors such as inconsistency with known effects of the study drug, lack of a temporal 
association with study drug administration, lack of association of the event with study 
drug withdrawa l or re -challenge, and/or presence of alternative explanations for the 
event. Alternative explanations might include a known relationship of the AE to a 
concomitant drug, medical history of a similar event, the subject’s disease state, other 
medical condit ions, or environmental factors.  
8.2.7.  Grading of Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of AE will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 5.0 (refer to the study manual) . For each episode, the highest severity grade 
attained should be reported.  
If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the investigator should use the following grade or adjectives  
to describe the maximum intensity of the AE : Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), G rade 3 
(severe), Grade 4 (life -threatening), or Grade 5 (fatal). For purposes of consistency with the 
CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in  Table  15. 
Table  15: Grading of Adverse Event Severity Grade  
Grade  Adjective  Description  
Grade 1  Mild  Sign or symptom is present, but it is easily tolerated, is not expected 
to have a clinically significant effect on the subject’s overall health and 
well-being, does not interfere with the subject’s usual function, and is 
not likely to require medical atten tion  
Grade 2  Moderate  Sign or symptom causes interference with usual activity or affects 
clinical status and may require medical intervention  
Grade 3  Severe  Sign or symptom is incapacitating or significantly affects clinical status 
and likely requires medical intervention and/or close follow -up  
Grade 4  Life-threatening  Sign or symptom results in a potential threat to life  
Grade 5  Fatal  Sign or symptom results in death  
8.2.8.  Adverse Event Reporting

Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 71 of 92 Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site. Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse 
need not be reported as AEs. However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to 
discontinuatio n of administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE.  
Information about AEs and SAEs will be collected from the date of signing of the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) until 30  calendar days following the last dose of study drug.  
The AE term  should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, 
the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), 
outcome, intensity, causality, action taken with study drug, serious criteria ( if applicable), and 
whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study.  
Intensity will be assessed according to the scaling demonstra ted in Table  15 (Section 8.2.7 ). 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(Section  8.2.7 ), whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  8.2.2 . An AE of 
severe intensity may not be considered serious.  
Should a pregnancy occur in a subject, or a female partner of a subject, it must be recorded on 
PTC’s Pregnancy Form and reported to PTC within 24 hours of first awareness (see contact 
details below). Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an 
investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) mu st be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complicat ions should not be 
handled as AEs . 
All AEs should be followed up by the investigator until they are resolved, or until the 
investigator assesses them as chronic or stable. The investigator should consider protocol 
guidelines and use his/her discretion in o rdering additional tests as necessary to monitor the 
resolution of such events. In the event of additional investigations, the PTC Pharmacovigilance 
Department or designee should be informed via e -mail or fax. A subject withdrawn from the 
study because of an AE must be followed by the investigator until clinical recovery is complete 
and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized. 
Follow -up may need to continue after the subject has discontinued from the study, and a dditional 
investigations may be requested by the medical monitoring team.  
The first day of AE reporting will coincide with the date of signing of  informed consent and/or 
assent (as appropriate) . 
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 72 of 92 8.2.9.  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All SAEs should be reported v ia the “SAE Report Form” to PTC immediately,  without undue 
delay , but under no circumstances later th an 24 hours of becoming aware of the event(s). In 
addition, the AE portion of the eCRF must also be completed in EDC.  
The SAE Report Form should be signed by the investigator; however, if the investigator is 
unable to sign at the time of the event or within 24 hours, the form should be signed by the 
clinical staff member reporting the SAE (eg, the study coordinator). The SAE Report Form must 
be faxed or e -mailed to the PTC Pharmacovigilance Department or designee and to the site 
IRB/EC (if required by local regulations) within 24 hours.  
Follow -up information to the SAE should be clearly documented with “Follow -up” box checked 
and the follow -up number in the S AE Report Form completed and faxed or e -mailed to the same 
party. All follow -up SAE Report Forms for the event must be signed by the investigator. Any 
source documents (eg, progress notes, nurses’ notes, laboratory and diagnostic test results, and 
discharg e summaries) provided to the sponsor should be redacted so that the subject’s name, 
address, and other personal identity information are obscured. Only the subject’s study number 
and initials are to be provided (in regions where the provision of such infor mation is permitted). 
The information in the AE portion of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form(s) must match or be 
reconciled. Where the same data are collected, the information on the SAE Report Form must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  
In the rare even t that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately ( eg, if a subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the 
event within 24 hours after learning of it and to document his/her first awarene ss of the AE.  
The PTC Pharmacovigilance Department contact information for reporting SAEs is provided

E-mail: , Facsimile:  
PTC is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain events. It is the PI’s 
responsibility to notify the IRB or IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigator s will 
also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug -related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that 
occur during the clinical trial. Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB or IEC of these 
additional SAEs.  
8.2.10.  Contraception  
Women  of childbearing pote ntial includes any female who has experienced menarche and who 
has not undergone successful  permanent  surgical sterilization (eg, hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy , and bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is 
defined as ≥12  months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. Females  who are 
using an active method of birth control, are practicing abstinence , or where the partner is sterile 
(eg, vasectomy), are considered to be women of childbearing potential .  

PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 73 of 92 Women  of childbearing potential  must use  at least  1 form of highly effective contraception for 
the duration of study participation  and for 90 days after last administration of study drug  in a 
manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Periodic and/or temporary  abstinence such as 
declaration of abstinence during study participation or fertility awareness -based methods to 
prevent pregnancy (including but not limited to symptothermal and ovulation estimation by 
either calendar day or salivary/cervical secretions) are not considered effective methods of birth 
control; however, true (absolute) sexual abstinence (ie, in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject) may be permitted.  Highly  effective methods of birth control approved for 
use in this study  are as follows : 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Intravaginal  
− Transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:  
− Oral 
− Injectable  
− Implantable  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia  
Prior to trial enrollment, women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of 
avoiding pregnan cy during study  participation. During the  study , all women of childbearing 
potential will be instructed to contact the  investigator immediately if they suspect they might be 
pregnant ( eg, missed or late menstrual  period).  
8.2.11.  Reporting Pregnancy  
PTC should be  notified in the event that a female subject in the study, or a female partner of a 
male subject in the study, becomes pregnant on -study or within 90 days of the last administration 
of study drug; this must be reported on a Pregnancy Notification Form (see  Study Manual for 
details). This must be done whether or not an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness 
of the pregnancy. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of birth or 
pregnancy termination.  
Written consent is required prior to collecting and reporting any information on a female partner 
of a male subject in the study.  
In any of the four situations listed below, the subject will be provided with a 
“Pregnancy/Pregnant Partner Data Release Form ” to request their consent to  follow the progress 
of the pregnancy and the birth and the health of their child.  
• Subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 74 of 92 • Female partner of a male subject participating in the study becomes pregnant  
• Subject becomes pregnant up to 90 days after  the last administration of the study drug 
(60 days after the 30 -day safety follow -up telephone call)  
• Female partner of a male subject participating in the study becomes pregnant up  to 
90 days after the partner completed the study  
Because the ris k to an unborn child is unknown, the subject should be asked to sign this consent 
form. However, signing this form is voluntary; it is up to the subjects to decide whether to agree 
to the collection of this information or not. Upon signing, the subject’s a nd the child’s medical 
records relating to the pregnancy and delivery, and the health of the child , will be reviewed for 
up to 1  year of age.  
If possible, the investigator should follow the subject, or the pregnant female partner of a male 
subject, until c ompletion of the pregnancy and notify the PTC medical monitor of the outcome 
within 5 days or as specified below. The investigator will provide this information as a follow -up 
to the initial Pregnancy Notification Form via the Pregnancy Outcome Form (see t he study 
manual for details).  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE 
(ie, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an 
aborted fetus]), the investigator sho uld follow the procedures for reporting SAEs  (ie, report the 
event to PTC Therapeutic Pharmacovigilance Department and follow -up by submission of 
appropriate AE eCRFs ). 
All information collected with regard to the pregnancy, the delivery of the child, and the health 
of the child is confidential to the limit allowed by law. These data will be coded to hide the 
subject’s identity and the identity of the child . In particular, the subject’s name and the child’s 
name will not be reproduced on any other paper or electronic document. These data will not be 
disclosed voluntarily by PTC. However, regulatory agencies may have to examine these data to 
ensure that the study is done properly.  
Of note, if the pregnant female partner of a male subject  participating in the study does not wish 
to provide such information, this will not prevent the partner from continuing with the study.  
8.3. PTC Adverse Event Reporting Requirement to Regulatory Authorities, 
Investigators , and IRB/ IEC 
As the sponsor of the study, PTC is responsible  for reporting any suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction s, and any other applicable SAEs, to regulatory authorities, IRB/IEC, 
investigators, and study sites in an expedited manner, in accordance with national regulations in 
the country. The initial expedited safety report will be provided as required according to local 
regulations (eg, within 15 days) after the earliest date PTC o r an agent of PTC (eg, a site 
monitor) becomes aware of a SAE. This awareness date is the date the regulatory reporting clock 
begins, and the date is considered Day 0.  
The in vestigator  should also forward a copy of all expedited reports to IRB/IEC, as per  local 
requirements. SAEs will not be reported to the IRB/IEC immediately, but instead will be sent 
periodically via inclusion in the annual safety report (eg, Development Safety Update Report ) to 
the reviewing committee per local requirements . 
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 75 of 92 9. STATISTIC AL CONSIDERATIONS  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and approved prior to study unblinding  to 
provide a more detailed description of the nature of the analyses and the manner in which results 
will be compiled. The SAP will include details of  the statistical models to be used and the test 
statistics to be employed . 
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
The null hypothesis of this study is that the mean  change  in Phe levels  from baseline to end of 
the double -blind treatment period is the same  in the PTC923  arm and in the placebo arm  versus 
the alternative that they are different ; a 2-sided test at the 5% alpha  level  will be applied.   
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
All subjects ≥2 years of age  with ≥15% response to PTC923 will be eligible to be randomized in 
Part 2 of the study. Subjects will be stratified in Part 2 based on their mean percent blood Phe 
reduction in Part 1 (ie, subjects with mean % reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥15% to <30% and 
subjects with mean % reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥30%). Within  each stratum, subjects will 
be randomized and allocated 1:1 to receive either  PTC923 or placebo. Enrollment will continue 
until approximately 80 subjects from the stratum of subjects with mean percent reduction in 
blood Phe levels of ≥30% during Part 1 ha ve been randomized. Additionally, subjects will be 
stratified based on their baseline blood Phe concentration (ie, subjects with baseline blood Phe 
<600  µmol/L and subjects with baseline blood Phe ≥600 µmol/L) and evenly distributed to either 
PTC923 or pla cebo treatment arms.  
For the primary endpoint with a sample size of 80 subjects ≥2 years of age for the stratum of 
subjects with mean percent reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥30% during Part 1, the power to 
detect a difference in reduction in blood Phe b etween PTC923 and placebo is >95%, assuming a 
treatment difference of 250 µmol/L and a within -treatment -group standard deviation of 
250 µmol/L, with a 2 -sided α  of 0.05.  
For the primary endpoint for all subjects in Part 2, the power to detect a difference in reduction 
in blood Phe between PTC923 and placebo is >95%, assuming a treatment difference of 
200 µmol/L, a within -treatment -group standard deviation of 250 µmol/L, and a total sample size 
of 106, with a 2 -sided α of 0.05. This sample size assumes appro ximately 60% of subjects 
≥2 years of age enrolled in Part 1 experience a ≥15% reduction in Phe levels.  
9.3. Population for Analyses  
Four study populations will be analyzed:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): All subjects who are randomized and take at least 1 dose of 
double -blind study drug in Part 2 will be included in the FAS. Subjects will be 
analyzed according to their randomized treatment. All efficacy analyses will be based 
on the FAS.  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 76 of 92 • Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set: The PP Analysis Set will include all subjects in the 
FAS who meet the study eligibility requirements and have no major protocol 
deviations that affect the validity of the efficacy measurements. The PP Analysis Set 
will be used for sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. The criteria for  
inclusion in the PP Analysis Set will be finalized prior to study unblinding and 
detailed in the SAP.  
• Safety Analysis Set: All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug, including 
during Part 1, will be included in the Safety Analysis Set. Subjec ts will be analyzed 
according to actual treatment received.  
• Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set: All subjects who have at least one measurable plasma 
concentration of sepiapterin or BH 4 will be included in the Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Set. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1.  General Approach  
For continuous variables, median, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and the 
number of subjects with non -missing data will be provided for each treatment group. For 
categorical variables, the number (percent) of subjects in each ca tegory will be provided.  
9.4.2.  Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints  
All efficacy analyses will be performed based on the FAS. The primary endpoint analysis will 
also be conducted using the PP Analysis Set.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, a gatekeeping procedure wil l be used to control the 
family -wise error rate:  
The stratum of subjects ≥2 years of age with mean percent reduction in Phe levels of ≥30% 
during Part 1 will be tested at the significance level of 0.05 ( 2-sided). If p<0.05 , then the study 
will be declared positive in this stratum.  
Only if the stratum of subjects ≥2 years of age with mean percent reduction in Phe levels of 
≥30% during Part 1 is statistically significant at the 0.05 level, will the overall study with all 
subje cts ≥2 years of age with a mean percent reduction in Phe levels of ≥15% during Part 1 be 
tested, also at the 0.05 significance level.  
For the primary endpoint of reduction in blood Phe for the stratum of subjects with mean percent  
reduction in blood Phe le vels of ≥30% during Part 1, a mixed model repeated measures 
(MMRM) model will be fitted using the available blood Phe data. The response variable is the 
change from baseline in blood Phe measured at postbaseline assessments for each subject. The 
model will  include fixed effects for treatment, baseline blood Phe, baseline Phe stratum 
(<600  μmol/L or ≥600 μmol/L), visit (categorical), and visit -by-treatment interaction. In 
addition, subject will be included as random effect. An unstructured within -subject cov ariance 
structure will be assumed. If the model does not converge under the unstructured covariance 
matrix, the following covariance structures will be employed in order until convergence is 
reached: heterogeneous Toeplitz, heterogeneous Compound Symmetry,  heterogeneous first -order 
autoregressive, Toeplitz, Compound Symmetry, and first -order autoregressive. The least squares 
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 77 of 92 (LS) mean estimate for the average change at Part 2 Weeks 5 and 6 will be used to perform 
treatment group comparisons. The LS means, t reatment effect estimate, confidence interval, and 
2-sided p  value will be presented. Corresponding LS means from the same MMRM model will 
be used to estimate the treatment effects at each visit week.  
For the primary endpoint of reduction in blood Phe levels for all subjects, the same MMRM 
model used for the stratum of subjects with mean percent reduction in blood Phe levels of ≥30% 
during Part  1 will be used with the addition of a fixed effect for Phe reduction randomization 
strata  (≥15% or ≥30%).   
The secondary efficacy endpoint  of change from baseline in mean blood Phe levels at each 
PTC923 dose level (ie, each 2 -week period in Part 2)  will be assessed using an MMRM  model.  
The proportion of subjects  with baseline Phe levels ≥600 μmol/L who achieve Phe levels 
<600  μmol/L  at the end of the double -blind treatment period  will be estimated and compared 
between treatment arms.  
9.4.3.  Missing Data  
For the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, MMRM model will be used on the available 
data assuming the missing assessments are missing at random (MAR). Missing data will be 
imputed using the multiple imputation procedure  (Rubin 1987 , Ouyang 2017 ) to further assess 
the influence of missing primary endpoint data and details of the method will b e provided in  the 
SAP. Briefly, these methodologies will include multiple imputation under an assumption of 
missing not at random and tipping -point analyses to explore how extreme the difference between 
randomized treatments would have to be among subjects  with missing data to overwhelm the 
treatment effect obtained in the primary. In these analyses, the multiple imputation approach will 
be expanded to allow for varying impact of missing data by incorporating a shift parameter in the 
imputation model. The r ange of values for the shift parameter will explore the varying missing 
data assumptions, including the scenario where the imputation model is completely based on the 
control group (ie, control -based imputation).  
9.4.4.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic  parameters and plasma concentrations will be summarized separately following 
different PK sampling scheme and population using descriptive statistics.  
Additionally, depending on the number of samples collected and subject demography, a 
population PK analysis  will be performed using all PK samples collected in the study to further 
characterize the PK of sepiapterin and BH 4 to examine potential source of PK variability, such as 
age, and to explore the relationship between exposure and response.  
9.4.5.  Safety Analyses  
9.4.5.1.  Subject Disposition  
The disposition of subjects, including the number of subjects screened, the number of 
randomized subjects, the number of randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug, and the number of subjects who prematurely disconti nue study drug, as well as the reason 
for the premature termination, will be tabulated.

Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 78 of 92 9.4.5.2.  Medical History and Prior Medication  
Medical history and prior medication information will be descriptively summarized.  
9.4.5.3.  Extent of Exposure and Treatment Compliance  
The extent of exposure to study drug is defined as the last dose date minus the first dose date 
+1 day. Compliance will be assessed in terms of the percentage of drug actually taken relative to 
the amount that should have been taken during the study. Expos ure and compliance will be 
summarized descriptively.  
9.4.6.  Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects will be summarized descriptively by means 
and standard deviations for continuous variables, and frequency distribution  for categorical 
variables. Summaries will be performed based on all randomized subjects.  
9.4.6.1.  Laboratory Parameters  
Changes in clinical laboratory tests from baseline (last measurement prior to randomization) and 
laboratory marked abnormalities using pre -defin ed abnormality criteria will be descriptively 
summarized.  
9.4.6.2.  Adverse Events  
Summary information (the number and percent of subjects by treatment) will be tabulated for:  
• Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Treatment -related AEs  
• TEAEs by severity  
• SAEs  
• AEs leading to discontinuation  
Summaries will be presented by treatment group and categorized by MedDRA System Organ 
Class and Preferred Term. The frequencies of AEs displayed will be the crude rates that 
represent the number of subjects experiencing AEs divi ded by the total number of subjects.

documents), all original signed ICFs , electronic copies (ie, CD -ROM, USB, etc.) or paper copies 
of the data that have been captured in the EDC for each subject (eCRFs), and detailed records of 
study drug disposition. All records and documents pertaining to the study will be maintained by 
the investigator until notification is received  from PTC that the records no longer need to be 
retained.  
The investigator must obtain written permission from PTC before disposing of any records. The 
investigator will promptly notify PTC in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study 
record s. If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the study, the 
study records may be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another 
institution, or to PTC as applicable.  
13.1. Inspection of Records  
PTC will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of 
monitoring any aspect of the study. The investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the 
drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, subjec t charts and study source 
documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
13.2. Retention of Records  
The investigator  must maintain all documentation relating to the study  for at least 15 years  (or 
longer depending on local requirements)  after completion  or discontinuation of the trial or at 
least 2 years after the granting of the last marketing authorization in the EU (when there are no 
pending or contemplated marketing applications in the EU) or for at least 2 years after formal 
discontinuation of clini cal development of the investigational product, whatever is the longest.  
If it becomes necessary for PTC or the regulatory authority to review any documentation relating 
to the study, the investigator must permit access to such records.  
13.3. Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is defined as any intentional or unintentional change to, or noncompliance 
with, the approved protocol procedures or requirements. Deviations may result from the action or 
inaction of the subject, investigator, or site staff. Examples  of deviations include, but are not 
limited to:  
• Failure to adhere to study exclusion and inclusion criteria  
• Failure to comply with dispensing or dosing requirements  
• Use of medications that are specifically prohibited in the protocol  
• Missed or out -of-window  visits  (excluding COVID -19 related site closures)  
• Drug dosing not administered within the time frame specified in the protocol  
PTC 923-MD-003-PKU  
Clinical Protocol  
V5.0 PTC Therapeutics - Confidential  Page 83 of 92 • Failure to adhere to test requirements, including vital signs, laboratory tests, physical 
examinations, PK blood draws, medical history, etc. - either tests not done, incorrect 
tests done, or not done within the time frame specified in the protocol  
• Procedural deviations such as incorrect storage of study drug, failure to update the 
informed consent/assent form  when new risks become known, or failure to obtain 
IRB/IEC approvals for the protocol and informed consent/assent form revisio ns 
Major deviations are any deviations that impact subject eligibility (ie, protocol 
inclusion/exclusion violations), subject safe ty, or a subject’s ability to continue in the clinical 
trial. 
At the outset of the study, a process for defining and handling protocol deviations will be 
established with the CRO. This will include determining which deviations will be designated 
major; thu s, requiring immediate notification to the medical monitor and the sponsor.  
Prospective deviations (eg, protocol waivers) are prohibited per PTC policy.  
The investigator is responsible for seeing that any known protocol deviations are recorded as 
agreed.

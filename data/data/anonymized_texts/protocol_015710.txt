PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Clinical Protocol 2016 -0902 IND 134400 
Study Title:  A Pilot Pre -Surgical Study Evaluating Anti -PD-L1 Antibody (Durvalumab) Plus Anti -
CTLA -4 Antibody (Tremelimumab) in Patients with Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative 
Breast Cancer   
Clinical Phase:  Pilot 
Study Duration:  24 months  
Investigational Product(s) and Referenc e Therapy:  
Durvalumab will be supplied in glass vials containing 500 mg of liquid solution at a concentration of 
50 mg/mL for intravenous (IV) administration.  
 
Tremelimumab is supplied as a sterile solution for IV infusion, filled in 20 mL clear glass vial s with 
a rubber stopper and aluminum seal. Each vial contains 20 mg/mL (with a nominal fill of 20 mL, 
accounting to 400 mg/vial) of tremelimumab, in an isotonic solution at pH 5.5.  
Research Hypothesis  
Our hypotheses are: 1) that it will be feasible to enr oll patients with hormone receptor (HR) -positive, 
HER2 -negative breast cancer onto a trial evaluating anti -CTLA -4 (cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -
associated antigen -4) therapy (tremelimumab)  plus anti -PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) 
therapy (durvalumab) pr ior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 2) that the combination 
of tremelimumab plus durvalumab therapy will have an acceptable safety profile in HR+/HER2-  
breast cancer patients; and 3) that tremelimumab plus durvalumab therapy will lead to m easurable 
immunologic changes, with identification of novel biomarkers that can be used for immune 
monitoring and clinical correlation in the setting of HR+/HER2-  breast cancer.  
Objectives:  
Primary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the feasibility of enrolling patients with HR+/HER2 - breast cancer onto a trial 
evaluating investigational agents prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy .

 Investigational Product(s), Dose , and Mode of Administration:  
Durvalumab, 1500 mg Q4W (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) for 2 doses/cycles in patients ≥ 30 kg 
Tremelimumab 75 mg  Q4W (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) for 2 doses/cycles in patients ≥30 kg  
Weight -based dosing should be utilized for patients <30 kg durvalumab 20 mg/kg Q4 and 
tremelimumab 1 mg/kg Q4   
Study Assessments and Criteria for Evaluation:  
The study’s primary endpoints are to evaluate the feasibility of enrolling patients with HR+/HER2-  
breast cancer onto a trial evaluating investigational agents prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy and to evaluate the safety and tolerabilit y of tremelimumab plus durvalumab in patients 
with HR+/HER2 - breast cancer.  
Feasibility Assessment s: 
Feasibility will be measured by 2 achievements.  If both are met, then upfront treatment with 
tremelimumab plus durvalumab will be feasible for future tria ls in HR+/HER2 - breast cancer patients.  
The 2 measures are:  
• Patients are willing to enroll.  This will be established if we can enroll all 15 patients within 
12 months of starting the study.  
• Patients can complete the protocol.  If at least 10 patients co mplete the study and have 
available immune data, the trial meets this feasibility criterion.  
Safety Assessments:  
All patients who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety monitoring and 
safety analysis.  For trial monitoring a nd decisions about future trials, a patient will be determined to 
have an extreme toxicity (ETOX) if either condition is met: 
 
• The patient experiences any grade 3 or higher adverse event (AE) that is possibly, probably, 
or definitely related to therapy rec eived on this protocol and occurs up to 90 days after the 
last dose of therapy  (durvalumab + tremelimumab ).  As an exception, any such AE that is 
potentially treatable with steroids will only count as an ETOX if it does not improve to grade 
1 or better wit hin 2 weeks.  
 
• The patient has a delay in surgery of 6 weeks or more due to AE, even if that AE does not 
meet the definition of ETOX

 Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  
Feasibility will be assessed according to the endpoint definition provided above.  Since it is not known 
whether durvalumab plus tremelimumab can be safely used in the presurgical setting in patients with 
HR+, HER2 - breast cancer, our other primary endpoint is safety.  Adverse events will be tabulated by 
CTCAE grade and ETOX status.  Sur gery delay will be reported with the numbers of patients with 
any delay, as well as the median, IQR, min and max for delay times.  If 6 or more patients experience 
ETOX, then this combination will be determined to be too toxic for these patients.  
 
For blood and tumor measures, descriptive statistics including plots, tabulations, mean, median and 
standard deviations will be used to summarize data.  Differences and/or percent changes will be 
calculated between pre-  and post -therapy samples from each patient a nd described as continuous 
measures.  
Sample Size Determination:  
The selection of 15 patients for this pilot trial is to provide preliminary information for feasibility and 
safety, as well as to have at least 10 patients with full immune measures pre and p ost treatment for 
hypothesis generation and testing in the next trial.  An accrual rate of 2 patients per month is 
anticipated.  A maximum sample size of 15 patients will be enrolled.  No hypotheses will be formally 
tested, but with 15 patients we can dete rmine whether an unreasonable proportion of patients have 
high grade toxicities and gather estimates of immune and molecular changes in tumor and peripheral 
blood.  These measures will be used to design a larger, hypothesis -driven trial.

1. Full physical examination at baseline; targeted physical examination at other time points  
2. If completed within 7 days of the date of treatmen t initiation, these do not need to be repeated.  
3. Height only needs to be measured and recorded at the baseline assessment.  
4. Subjects will have their blood pressure and pulse measured before, during, and after the infusion 
at the following times (based on a 60- minute infusion):   
a. At the beginning of the infusion (at 0 minutes)  
b. At 30 minutes during the infusion (± 10 minutes)  
c. At the end of the infusion (60 minutes ± 10 minutes)  
d. In the 1 hour observation period post -infusion:  30 and 60 minutes after the infusion (i.e. 
90 and 120 minutes from the start of the infusion) (± 10 minutes) –  for the first infusion 
only and then for subsequent infusions as clinically indi cated 
e. If the infusion lasts longer than 60 minutes, then blood pressure and pulse measurements 
should f ollow the principles as described above or more frequently if clinically 
indicated.  
5. Coagulation tests: prothrombin time, APTT and INR – only performed at Screening and as 
clinically indicated.  
6. Chemistries include: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, a mylase, lipase, calcium, 
bicarbonate, chloride, creatinine, glucose, LDH, magnesium, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, 
total protein, BUN, uric acid. If total bilirubin is ≥ 2x ULN (and no evidence of Gilbert’s 
syndrome), then bilirubin should be fractionated into direct and indirect bilirubin.  
7. If screening laboratory assessments are performed within 3 days  prior to Day 1 they do not need 
to be repeated at Day 1. Results for safety bloods must be available and reviewed before 
commencing an infusion. Gamma  glutamyltransferase tested at Screening, Day 1 and as 
clinically indicated.  
8. Free T3 and free T4 will only be measured if TSH is abnormal. They should also be measured 
if there is clinical suspicion of an adverse event related to the endocrine system.  
9. Pre-menopausal female subjects of childbearing potential only  
10. Urinalysis performed at Screening, Day 1, then at Cycle 1, Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1, and as 
clinically indicated.  Microscopy should be used as appropriate to investigate white blood cells 
and use th e high power field for red blood cells.  
11. Ultrasound evaluation of the breast tumor and nodal basins will use tumor volume to estimate 
changes in the tumor in the breast from baseline until after investigational therapy.  Tumor 
volume = (length x width x hei ght x π)/6  
12. ECG during screening and on cycle 1 Day 1 within 1 hour prior to start of the first study 
treatment. Subsequent ECGs as clinically indicated.  If an ECG is interpreted to be a prolonged 
QT interval, 2 additional ECGs will be obtained and the PI will then evaluate all 3 ECGs to 
determine whether the patient should be excluded.

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Immunotherapy and Breast Cancer  
Historically breast  cancer has been considered a nonimmunogenic tumor.  More recent data demonstrates 
that there are tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in breast tumors and that the extent of infiltrate varies 
with breast cancer subtype.  In a study from Loi et al. across subtypes, the median percentage of 
infiltration of stromal lymphocytes was 10%; interquartile range 7.5% to 20% (Loi et al 2013).  The 
percentage was  lowest in HR+/HER2 - tumors and highest in triple negative (TNBC).  Based in part on 
this observation, the  majority of studies conducted to date evaluating immunotherapy, specifically drugs 
targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD -L1) pathway, 
have focused on TNBC.   
In the KEYNOTE -012 trial, a multicenter, nonrandomiz ed phase Ib trial of single -agent pembrolizumab 
(anti-PD-1), investigators reported that in 32 metastatic TNBC patients whose tumors expressed PD -L1, 
the drug was well tolerated with the majority of patients experiencing low grade toxicities to include 
arthralgia, fatigue, myalgia and nausea.  Among the 27 patients evaluable for antitumor activity, the 
overall response rate (defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete 
response [CR] or partial response [PR]) was 18.5% with the median duration of response not reached; 
and with 3 responders remaining on study and receiving treatment for > 1 year (Nanda et al 2016).  At 
the 2016 ASCO meeting, investigators reported on a phase Ib study evaluating the anti -PD-L1 antibody 
atezoliz umab in combination with nab- paclitaxel in patients with metastatic TNBC.  The combination 
was well tolerated and in 24 patients evaluable for efficacy, the overall response rate (defined as CR, PR 
or stable disease [SD]) was 42% (Adams et al 2016) .  
Other  studies have evaluated single agent therapy targeting PD -1/PD -L1 in HR+/HER2 - disease.  At the 
2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, data from the Javelin trial, a phase IB study of avelumab 
(anti-PD-L1) was presented.  The trial enrolled patients wit h locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
unselected for ER/PR and HER2.  Among the 72 patients with HR+/HER2-  disease, the response rate 
was only 2.8%  (Dirix et al 2015) .  At that same meeting, results of the KEYNOTE -028 study evaluating 
pembrolizuma b in patients with HR+ tumors was presented.  In that study, there were 25 patients with 
HR+ MBC with an overall response rate of 12%  (Rugo et al 2015) .   
It is possible that the low response rate to anti -PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 in HR+/HER2 - breast cancer is du e 
to the low rate of TIL in these tumors which could be described as nonimmunogenic (“cold”).  In order 
to enhance response to anti -PD-1/anti -PD-L1 therapy, it is likely that an immune response will need to 
be stimulated thereby converting these “cold” tum ors to immunogenic, “hot” lesions  (Sharma and 
Allison 2015) .  One strategy to enhance the immune infiltrate is to treat with the anti -CTLA -4 antibody 
tremelimumab.  Unpublished data from our collaborator, Dr. James Allison has shown that, in prostate 
cance r, also an immunologically “cold” tumor, tremelimumab induces an intratumoral T cell  infiltrate.  
That T cell infiltrate is notable for increased PD -1 expression thereby justifying the combination with 
the anti -PD-L1 antibody durvalumab.

 1.1.1 Immunotherapies  
It is increasingly understood that cancers are recognized by the immune system, and, under some 
circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors ( Dunn et al 2004).  Studies in 
mouse models of transplantable tumors  have demonstrated th at manipulation of co- stimulatory or co -
inhibitory signals can amplify T -cell responses against tumors (Peggs et al 2009 ).  This amplification 
may be accomplished by blocking co- inhibitory molecules, such as cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated 
antigen 4 (CTL A-4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD -1), from binding with their ligands, B7 or B7- H1 
(programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD -L1]).   
1.1.2 Durvalumab  
The non- clinical and clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the durvalumab 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB  Version 9.0 ).   
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) 1 kappa subclass 
that inhibits binding of PD -L1 and is being developed by AstraZeneca/MedImmune for use in the 
treatment of cancer.  (MedImmune is a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca; 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune will be referred to as AstraZeneca throughout this document.)  As durvalumab 
is an engineered mAb, it does not induce antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement -
dependent cytotoxici ty.  The proposed mechanism of action for durvalumab  is interference of the 
interaction of PD -L1. 
Durvalumab has been given to humans as part of ongoing studies as a single drug or in combination with 
other drugs  As of the DCO dates (15Apr2015 to 18Sep2015), a total of 1,910 subjects have been 
enrolled and treated in 30 ongoing durvalumab clinical studies, including 20 sponsore d and 
10 collaborative studies . Of the 1,910 subjects, 1,279 received durvalumab monotherapy, 454 
received durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab or other anticancer agents, 14 received 
other agents (1 gefitinib, 13 MEDI6383), and 163 have been treated with blinded investigational 
product. No studies have been completed or terminated prematurely due to toxicity .  
As of 09Feb2015, PK data were available for 378  subjects in  the dose -escalation and dose- expansion 
phases of Study CD -ON-durvalumab -1108 following treatment with durvalumab 0.1 to 10 mg/kg every 
2 weeks (Q2W) or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W). The maximum observed concentrat ion (C max) 
increased in an approximately dose- proportional manner over the dose range of 0.1 to 15 mg/kg. The 
area under the concentration- time curve from 0 to 14 days (AUC 0-14) increased in a greater than 
dose-proportional manner over the dose range of 0.1 to 3  mg/kg and increased dose -proportionally at ≥ 
3 mg/kg. These results suggest durvalumab  exhibits nonlinear PK likely due to saturable target -mediated 
CL at doses <  3 mg/kg and approaches linearity at doses ≥  3 mg/kg. Near complete target saturation 
(soluble programmed cell death ligand 1 [sPD -L1] and membrane bound) is expected with durvalumab  
≥ 3 mg/kg Q2W. Exposures after multiple doses showed accumulation consistent with PK parameters 
estimated from the first dose. In addition, PK simulations indic ate that following durvalumab 10 mg/kg 
Q2W dosing, >  90% of subjects are expected to maintain PK exposure ≥  40 µg/mL throughout the 
dosing interval.

 As of 09Feb2015, a total of 388 subjects provided samples for ADA analysis. Only 8 of 388 subjects (1 
subje ct each in 0.1, 1, 3, and 15 mg/kg cohorts, and 4 subjects in 10 mg/kg cohort) were ADA positive 
with an impact on PK/pharmacodynamics in 1 subject in the 3 mg/kg cohort.  
Durvalumab is currently being evaluated in a number of breast cancer specific studies  including: 1) an 
open label single arm trial evaluating durvalumab in combination with paclitaxel  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , 2) an 
open label pilot study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination of durvalumab 
with Vigil™ autologous tumor ce ll immunotherapy  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , 3) a phase Ib pharmacodynamics 
study  in patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer receiving trastuzumab ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , 4) a 
single arm neoadjuvant phase I/II study of durvalumab in combination with weekly Nab -paclitaxel a nd 
dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide for clinical stage I -III TNBC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and 5) a 
randomized phase II study investigating the addition of durvalumab to a taxane -anthracycline containing 
chemotherapy regimen in TNBC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .   
1.1.3 Tremelimu mab  
The non- clinical and clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the tremelimumab 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB  Version 7.0 ).   
Tremelimumab  is an IgG 2 kappa isotype mAb directed against  the cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated 
protein 4 (CTLA -4) also known as CD152 (cluster of differentiation 152)   This is an immunomodulatory 
therapy (IMT) that is being developed by AstraZeneca for use in the treatment of cancer.   
Binding of CTLA -4 to its target ligands (B7 -1 and B7- 2) provides a nega tive regulatory signal, which 
limits T -cell activation.  Anti- CTLA -4 inhibitors antagonize the binding of CTLA -4 to B7 ligands and 
enhance human T -cell activation as demonstrated by increased cytokine (interleukin [IL] -2 and 
interferon [IFN] gamma) product ion in vitro in whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
(PBMC) cultures (Tarhini and Kirkwood 2008) .  In addition, blockade of CTLA -4 binding to B7 by anti -
CTLA -4 antibodies results in markedly enhanced T -cell activation and anti -tumor activity in  animal 
models, including killing of established murine solid tumors and induction of protective anti -tumor 
immunity.  (Refer to the tremelimumab IB, Edition 5.0, for more information.)  Therefore, it is expected 
that treatment with an anti- CTLA -4 antibody , such as tremelimumab, will lead to increased activation 
of the human immune system, increasing anti -tumor activity in patients with solid tumors.    
An extensive program of non- clinical and clinical studies has been conducted for tremelimumab both as 
monotherapy and combination therapy with conventional anticancer agents to support various cancer 
indications using different dose schedules.  As of the data cut -off date of 12 November  2014 (for all 
studies except D4190C00006, which has a cut -off date of 4 De cember  2014), 973 patients have received 
tremelimumab monotherapy (not including 497 patients who have been treated in the blinded Phase 2b 
study, D4880C00003) and 208 patients have received tremelimumab in combination with other agents.  
Refer to the curr ent tremelimumab IB for a complete summary of non -clinical and clinical information; 
see Section  6.6 for guidance on management of tremelimumab -related toxicities.

 Tremelimumab exhibited a biphasic PK profile with a long terminal phase half -life of 22  days.  Overall, 
a low incidence of ADAs (<6%) was observed for treatment with tremelimumab.   
1.1.4 Durvalumab  in combination with tremelimumab  
Targeting both PD -1 and CTLA -4 pathways may have additive or synergistic activity (Pardoll 2012 ) 
because the mechanisms of action of CTLA -4 and PD -1 are non- redundant; therefore, AstraZeneca is 
also investigating the use of durvalumab  + tremelimumab combination therapy for the treatment of 
cancer.  
Study D4190C00006 is a Phase Ib dose -escalation study to establish safety, PK /PDx, and preliminary 
anti-tumor activity of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy in patients with advanced 
NSCLC.  The dosing schedule utilized is durvalumab  every 2 weeks (q2w) or every 4 weeks (q4w) up 
to Week 50 and 48 (12 months), combined wi th tremelimumab q4w up to Week 24 for 7 doses then 
every 12  weeks for 2 additional doses for up to 12 months.  The study is ongoing and continues to accrue.   
Study D4190C00006:  As of 20Feb2015, durvalumab PK (n = 55) and tremelimumab PK (n =  26) data 
were  available from 10 cohorts (1a, 2a, 3a, 3b, 4, 4a, 5, 5a, 8, and 9) following durvalumab every 4 
weeks (Q4W) or Q2W dosing in combination with tremelimumab Q4W regimens. An approximately 
dose-proportional increase in PK exposure (C max and area under the concentration -time curve from 0 to 
28 days [AUC 0-28]) of both durvalumab and tremelimumab was observed over the dose range of 3 to 15 
mg/kg durvalumab Q4W and 1 to 10 mg/kg tremelimumab Q4W. Exposures following multiple doses 
demonstrated accumulation consis tent with PK parameters estimated from the first dose. It is to be noted 
that steady state PK parameters are based on limited numbers of subjects. The observed PK exposures 
of durvalumab and tremelimumab following combination were consistent with respectiv e monotherapy 
data, indicating no PK interaction between these 2 agents.  
As of 20Feb2015, ADA data were available from 60 subjects for durvalumab and 53 subjects for 
tremelimumab in Study D4190C00006. Four of 60 subjects were ADA positive for anti -durvalum ab 
antibodies post treatment. One of 53 subjects was ADA positive for anti -tremelimumab antibodies post 
treatment. There was no clear relationship between ADA and the dose of either durvalumab or 
tremelimumab, and no obvious association between ADA and saf ety or efficacy.  
The combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab is currently being investigated in several trials 
enrolling patients with metastatic breast cancer including:  1)  a phase I study evaluating the safety and 
tolerability of the combination in p atients with advanced ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, non -triple 
negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), 2)  a phase I trial of 
hypofractionated radiotherapy in combination with tremelimumab and durvalumab for patie nts with 
metastatic melanoma, non -small cell lung cancer, breast cancer or pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and 3)  a single arm phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination 
in patients with metastatic HER2 - breast cancer (NC T02536794) . 
Durvalumab has also been combined with other anticancer agents, including gefitinib, dabrafenib, and 
trametinib. To date, no PK interaction has been observed between durvalumab and these agents.

 A population PK model was developed for MEDI4736 using monotherapy data from a Phase 1 study 
(study 1108; N=292; doses= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W; solid tumors ). Population PK 
analysis indicated only minor impact of body weight (WT) on PK of MEDI4736 (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). 
The impact of body WT -based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing (750 mg Q2W) of MEDI4736 was 
evaluated by comparing predicted steady state PK concentrations (5th, median and 95th percentiles) using 
the population PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg was selected to approximate 10 mg /kg (based on 
median body WT of ~75 kg). A total of 1000 patients were simulated using body WT distribution of 40–
120 kg. Simulation results demonstrate that body WT -based and fixed dosing regimens yield similar 
median steady state PK concentrations with slightly less overall between -subject variability with fixed 
dosing regimen.   
 
Similarly, a population PK model was developed for tremelimumab using data from Phase 1 through 
Phase 3 ( N=654; doses= 0.01 to 15 mg/kg Q4W or Q90D; metastatic melanoma ) (Wang e t al 2009) . 
Population PK model indicated minor impact of body WT on PK of tremelimumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). 
The WT-based (1 mg/kg Q4W) and fixed dosing (75 mg/kg Q4W; based on median body WT of ~75 
kg) regimens were compared using predicted PK concentr ations ( 5th, median and 95th percentiles ) using 
population PK model in a simulated population of 1000 patients with body weight distribution of 40 to 
120 kg. Similar to MEDI4736, simulations indicated that both body WT -based and fixed dosing 
regimens of tr emelimumab yield similar median steady state PK concentrations with slightly less 
between -subject variability with fixed dosing regimen .  
 
Similar findings have been reported by others (Ng et al 2006; Wang et al 2009; Zhang S et al 2012; 
Narwal R et al 201 3). Wang and colleagues investigated 12 monoclonal antibodies and found that fixed 
and body size -based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies 
(Wang et al 2009) . In addition, they investigated 18 therapeutic proteins  and peptides and showed that 
fixed dosing performed better for 12 of 18 in terms of reducing the between- subject variability in 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics parameters (Zhang et al 2012) .  
 
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by the prescribing community due to ease of use and reduced dosing 
errors. Given expectation of similar pharmacokinetic exposure and variability, we considered it feasible 
to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W 
MEDI4736 (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) and 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) 
is included in the current study. Fixed dosing of durvalumab and tremelimumab is recommend only for 
subjects with > 30kg body weight due to endotoxin exposure.  Patients with a body weight less than or 
equal to 30 kg should be dosed using a weight -based dosing schedule.   
1.2 Research hypothes es 
This study will address the following hypotheses:  
1. That it will be feasible to enroll patients with hormone receptor (HR) -positive, HER2 -negative 
breast cancer onto a trial evaluating anti -CTLA -4 (cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated antigen -
4) therapy (tremelimumab)  plus anti -PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) therapy 
(durvalumab) prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy . 
2016 -0902

25 
 
25 
 2. That the combination of tremelimumab plus durvalumab therapy will have an acceptable safety 
profile in HR+/HER2-  breast cancer patients.  
3. That tremelimumab plus durvalumab therapy will lead to measurable immunologic changes, 
with identification of novel biom arkers that can be used for immune monitoring and clinical 
correlation in the setting of HR+/HER2-  breast cancer . 
1.3 Rationale for conducting this study  
At The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, we are initiating a trial platform to evaluate 
immun otherapeutic and targeted agents to turn nonimmunogenic (“cold”) hormone receptor positive, 
HER2 negative breast cancers into immunogenic (“hot”) lesions (Sharma and Allison 2015).  The trials 
will each enroll 15 patients with newly- diagnosed hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast 
cancer that are planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The investigational agent or combination of 
agents will be administered prior to initiation of chemotherapy.  All patients will undergo pre - and post -
treatment biopsie s which will be analyzed for immunologic responses to the investigational agents.  
These immune studies will be performed by the immunotherapy platform under the direction of Drs. Jim 
Allison and Padmanee Sharma.  The strength of this trial platform is tha t each study will require only 15 
patients and because of the robust immunologic analysis performed on pre - and post -treatment 
specimens, promising agents that can be moved forward into more definitive clinical trials will be 
identified quickly.  
 
This tria l platform is similar to that employed by our collaborator Dr. Sharma.  A previous study 
performed at MD Anderson by Dr. Sharma evaluated the use of an anti -CTLA -4 antibody (ipilimumab) 
as pre- surgical therapy in patients with localized urothelial carcinom a of the bladder (Carthon et al 2010).  
Immunological analyses of pre - and post -treatment tumor tissues indicate that ipilimumab therapy 
resulted in significant activation of immune cells and infiltration of immune cells into tumor tissues 
(Chen et al 2009 ; Liakou et al 2008).  The rationale for combining durvalumab and tremelimumab is 
that the mechanisms of CTLA -4 and PD -1 are non- redundant, suggesting that targeting both pathways 
may have additive or synergistic activity (Pardoll 2012) .  This has been dem onstrated in preclinical 
models (Curran et al 2011; Duraiswamy et al 2013) as well as in clinical trials where combining 
immunotherapy agents has been shown to result in improved response rates (RRs) relative to 
monotherapy.  For example, the concurrent administration of nivolumab and ipilimumab to patients with 
advanced melanoma induced higher objective response rates (ORRs) than those obtained with single -
agent therapy.  Importantly, responses appeared to be deep and durable (Wolchok et al 2013) .  Similar  
results have been observed in an ongoing study of durvalumab + tremelimumab in NSCLC ( Antonia et 
al 2014), with further updated details presented in this clinical study protocol . 
 
This study will allow us to evaluate the feasibility of enrolling patients with HR+/HER2 - breast cancer 
onto a trial evaluating investigational immunotherapeutic agents prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of tremelimumab plus 
durvalumab in patients with HR+/HER2 - breast cancer.  Importantly, we will also be able to assess the 
immunologic/molecular responses to the combination of tremelimumab plus durvalumab in patients with

 HR+/HER2 - breast cancer as well as to evaluate the pathologic response in HR+ /HER2 - breast cancer 
patients receiving the combination prior to initiation of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  The study 
will therefore allow us to test the clinical activities of these immune checkpoint therapies against 
HR+/HER2 - breast cancer as wel l to identify biomarkers to guide potential use of these agents in the 
setting of HR+/HER2 - breast cancer.  The study will therefore inform the design of subsequent studies 
evaluating these agents in both the neoadjuvant setting for patients with disease as well as in the setting 
of metastatic HR+/HER2 - breast cancer.

 3.2 Study sche ma 
Figure 1.  Study Schema  
 
 
Notes:  
A.  Eligible patients include those with HR+/HER2 - breast cancer, clinical stage I I-III, planned for 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
B. The first day of dosing is considered Day 1.  Tremelimumab will be administered first.  The 
duration of tremelimumab infusion will be 1 hour.  Durvalumab infusion will start 
approximately 1 hour after the end of the tremelimumab infusion.  The duration of durvalumab 
infusion will be 1 hour.  
C. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy will begin within 28 days of the last infusion of tremelimumab 
and durvalumab. 
D. Surgery will be performed within 8 weeks of complet ing neoadjuvant systemic therapy.    
3.3 Study Oversight for Safety Evaluation  
The study would be stopped if an unacceptable number of patients experience an extreme toxicity 
(ETOX).  For trial monitoring, a patient will be determined to have an ETOX if either condition is met:  
• The patient experiences any grade 3 or higher adverse event (AE) that is possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to therapy  (durvalumab + tremelimumab)  received on this protocol and occurs 
up to 90 days after the last dose of therapy.  As an exception, any such AE that is potentially 
treatable with steroids will only count as an ETOX if it does not improve to grade 1 or better 
within 2 weeks.

 • The patient has a delay in initiation of neoadjuvant systemic therapy of 6 weeks or more due t o 
AE, even if that AE does not meet the definition of ETOX.  
Based on the method of Thall (Thall et al 1995), we will monitor ETOX continually after the 5th patient 
receives treatment.  We assume Ɵ T ~ beta (0.2 0, 0.8 ) for the current study, where Ɵ T is the probability 
of a patient experiencing an ETOX.  Our stopping rule is given by the following probability statement: 
PT(ƟT>0.20 | data) > 0.90.  That is, we will stop the trial if, at any time during the study, we determine 
that there is more than an 90% chance t hat the ETOX rate is more than 2 0%. 
The stopping boundaries for this toxicity rule are to terminate the trial if the number of patients with 
ETOX comp ared to the number of patients on trial exceed the limits in table 1, with operating 
characteristics for this rule in table 2.   After 5 patients, this table will be consulted prior to enrolling each 
patient.  Enrollment will not require waiting for complete information for the previous patient, unless an 
ETOX in that patient would result in hitting the stopping rule.

5.2 Dose and treatment regimens  
5.2.1 Treatment regimens  
Durvalumab  + tremelimumab combination therapy  
2016 -0902 
5 October 2018 
34 
  
34 
 Patients will receive 1500 mg  durvalumab via IV infusion q4w  ± 3 days  for 2 doses/cycles and 75 mg 
tremelimumab via IV infusion q4w  ± 3 days  for 2 doses/cycles.  Dosing outside the window should be 
discussed with Dr. Litton and/or Dr. Mittendorf .  Tremelimumab will be administered first.  Durvalumab 
infusion will start approximately 1 hour a fter the end of tremelimumab infusion.  The duration will be 
approximately 1 hour for each infusion.  A 1- hour observation period is required after the first infusion 
of durvalumab  and tremelimumab.  If no clinically significant infusion reactions are obse rved during or 
after the first cycle, subsequent infusion observation periods will be 30 minutes +/-  5 minutes unless 
otherwise specified by the investigator .   
5.2.2 Duration of treatment  
Patients will receive 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion q4w +/ - 3 days for 2 doses/cycles and 75 mg 
tremelimumab via IV infusion q4w +/ - 3 days for up to 2 doses/cycles. A standard regimen of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be initiated within 28 days after the last infusion of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab.  A biopsy will be obt ained after the last infusion of durvalumab and tremelimumab 
before chemotherapy is started.  
 
5.2.3 Study drug preparation of durvalumab and tremelimumab  
Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab (equivalent to 20 mg/kg 
Q4W) and 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab (equivalent to 1 mg/kg Q4W) is included in the current study.  
 
Preparation of durvalumab doses for administration with an IV bag  
The dose of durvalumab for administration must be prepared using aseptic technique.  Total time from 
needle puncture of the durvalumab vial to the start of administration should not exceed:  
• 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)  
• 4 hours at room temperature  
If in-use storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. Infusion 
solut ions must be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to commencement of administration.  
No incompatibilities between durvalumab and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin IV bags have been 
observed. Dose of 1500mg durvalumab for patients ≥ 30 kg will be administered using an IV bag 
containing 0.9% (w/v) saline, with a final durvalumab concentration ranging from 1 to 20 mg/mL, and 
delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.2-  or 0.22- μm in -line filter.   Remove 30.0 mL of IV 
solution  from the IV bag prior to addition of durvalumab.  Next, 30.0 mL of durvalumab (ie, 1500 mg 
of durvalumab) is added to the IV bag such that final concentration is within 1 to 20 mg/mL (IV bag 
volumes 100 to 1000 mL).  Mix the bag by gently inverting to ens ure homogeneity of the dose in the 
bag.

35 
 Patient weight at baseline should be used for dosing calculations unless t h e r e  i s  a  ≥ 1 0 %  change in 
weight.  Dosing day weight can be used for dosing calculations instead of baseline weight per 
institutional standard.   
For patients <30kg, Calculate the dose volume of durvalumab  and tremelimumab and number of vials 
needed for th e subject to achieve the accur ate dose.  
Durvalumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C) by controlled infusion via 
an infusion pump into a peripheral or central vein. Following preparation of durvalumab, the entire 
contents of the IV bag should be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes (±5 
minutes), using a 0.2, or 0.22- μm in -line filter. Less than 55 minutes is considered a deviation.  
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of IV solution (0.9% [w/v] saline  equal to the priming volume 
of the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete the infusion 
according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and document if the line was not 
flushed.  
Standard infusion time is 1 hour.  However, if there are interruptions during infusion, the total allowed 
time should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature.  The table below summarizes time allowances and 
temperatures.  
Durvalumab hold and infusion times  
Maxim um time from needle puncture to start of 
administration  4 hours at room temperature, 24 hours at 2° C to 8 °C 
Maximum time for IV bag infusion, including 
interruptions  8 hours at room temperature  
 
In the event that either preparation time or infusion time exceeds the time limits outlined in the table, a 
new dose must be prepared from new vials.  Durvalumab does not contain preservatives, and any unused 
portion must be discarded.  
Preparation of tremelimumab doses for administration with an IV bag  
The dose of  tremelimumab for administration must be prepared using aseptic technique.  Total time from 
needle puncture of the tremelimumab vial to the start of administration should not exceed:  
• 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)  
• 4 hours at room temperature  
It is recommended that the prepared final IV bag be stored in the dark at 2ºC -8°C (36°F -46°F) until 
needed. If storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. The 
2016 -0902 
5 October 2018

36 
 refrigerated infusion solutions in the prepared final IV bag should be equilibrated at room temperature 
for about 2 hours prior to administration. Tremelimumab does not contain preservatives and any unused 
portion must be discarded.  
No incompatibilities between tremelimumab and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin IV bags have been 
observed. Doses of 75 mg tremelimumab for patients ≥30 kg will be administered using an IV bag 
containing 0.9% (w/v) saline, with a final tremelimumab concentration ranging from 0.1 mg/mL to 10 
mg/mL, and delivered through an IV administration set with a 0.2 μm or 0.22 μm in- line filter. Remove 
3.8 mL of I V solution from the IV bag prior to addition of tremelimumab.  Next, 3.8 mL of 
tremelimumab (ie, 75 mg of tremelimumab) is added to the IV bag such that final concentration is within 
0.1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL (IV bag volumes 50 to 500 mL).  Mix the bag by gent ly inverting to ensure 
homogeneity of the dose in the bag. 
Patient weight at baseline should be used for dosing calculations unless there is a  ≥10%  change in 
weight.  Dosing day weight can be used for dosing calculations instead of baseline weight per 
institutional standard.   
For patients <30 kg, Calculate the dose volume for tremelimumab and number of vials needed for subject 
to achieve the accurate dose.  
Tremelimumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C ) by controlled infusion 
via an infusion pump into a peripheral  or central  vein. Following preparation of tremelimumab,  the 
entire contents of the IV bag should be admi nistered as an IV infusion over approximately 60 m inutes 
(±5 minutes), using a 0.2, or 0.22- μm in -line filter. Less than 55 minutes is considered a deviation.  
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of 0.9% (w/v) saline equal to the priming volume of the 
infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete the infusion 
according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and document if the line was not 
flushed.  
Standard infusion time is 1 hour.  However, if there are interruptions during infusion, t he total allowed 
time should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature.  The table below summarizes time allowances and 
temperatures.  
Tremelimuab hold and infusion times

 In the event that either preparation time or infusion time exceeds the time limits outlined in the table, a 
new dose must be prepared from new vials.  Tremelimumab does not contain preservatives, and any 
unused portion must be discarded.  
5.2.4 Monitoring of dose administration  
Patients will be monitored during and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs as per Schedule 
of Study Assessments.   
A 1-hour observation period is required after the first infusion of durvalumab and tremelimumab.  
In the event of a ≤Grade  2 infusion- related reaction, the infusion rate of study drug may be decreased by 
50% or interrupted until resolution of the event and re-initiated at 50% of the initial rate until completion 
of the infusion.  For patients with a ≤Grade 2 infusion -related reaction, subsequent infusions may be 
administered at 50% of the initial rate.   Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydra mine) 
or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator.   If the infusion- related reaction is ≥Grade 3 or higher in severity, study drug will be 
discontinued.  
As with any antibody, allergic react ions to dose administration are possible.   Appropriate drugs and 
medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study 
personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.  The study site must have immedi ate access 
to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to admit patients to an intensive 
care unit if necessary . 
5.2.5 Accountability and dispensation  
Drug accountability and dispensation will occur through the Department of Pharmac y Investigational 
Drugs and all standard operating procedures of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.  
5.2.6 Disposition of unused investigational study drug  
The site will account for all investigational study drug dispensed and also for appropriate  destruction.  
Certificates of delivery and destruction must be maintained as part of Institutional current standard 
operating procedures.  
6. TREATMENT PLAN  
6.1 Subject enrollment  
Patients who have signed informed consent and have undergone screening will be enr olled onto this 
study and can begin therapy.  There is no randomization.  This is a single arm, open- label presurgical 
pilot study prior to the initiation of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy of the physician’s choice for 
patients with clinical stage I I-III HR+/HER2 - breast cancer.  Patients who are unable to complete all 
2016 -0902 
5 October 2018 
38 
  
38 
 scheduled study requirements including the pre and post treatment breast biopsies can be replaced at the 
request of Dr. Litton and/or Dr. Mittendorf  and/or the study team. 
6.1.1 Procedures for h andling subjects incorrectly enrolled  
Subjects who are incorrectly enrolled, but not yet initiated on treatment will be withdrawn from the study 
and replaced.  
6.2 Dosage and Administration  
Patients will receive 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion q4w +/ - 3 days  for 2 doses/cycles and 75 mg 
tremelimumab via IV infusion q4w +/ - 3 days for 2 doses/cycles. Dosing outside the window should be 
discussed with Dr. Litton and/or Dr. Mittendorf .  Tremelimumab will be administered first.  Durvalumab 
infusion will start app roximately 1 hour after the end of tremelimumab infusion.  The duration will be 
approximately 1 hour for each infusion.  A 1- hour observation period is required after the first infusion 
of durvalumab and tremelimumab.  If no clinically significant infusion reactions are observed during or 
after the first cycle, subsequent infusion observation periods can be at the Investigator’s discretion 
(suggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab and tremelimumab infusion).   
6.3 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management  
6.3.1 Durvalumab and tremelimumab  
For adverse events (AEs) that are considered at least partly due to administration of durvalumab the 
following dose adjustment guidance may be applied:  
• Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding the agent 
suspected of causing the toxicity where required).  
• If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be given to 
continuing the same dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab along with appropriate continuing 
supportive care.  If  medically appropriate,  dose modifications are permitted for durvalumab and 
tremelimumab  (see Appendix 1) . 
• All dose modifications should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of the 
approach taken.  
 
In addition, there are certain circumstanc es in which durvalumab or tremelimumab should be 
permanently discontinued.  
 
Following the first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab, subsequent administration of durvalumab or 
tremelimumab can be modified based on toxicities obser ved (see Appendix 1).   
Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab or tremelimumab leading to T -cell activation and 
proliferation, there is the possibility of observing immune related Adverse Events (irAEs) during the 
conduct of this study.  Potential irAEs include immune -mediat ed enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and 
endocrinopathies. Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the absence of an

 alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD) signs or symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and 
endocrinopathy should be considered to be immune -related.   
Dose modification recommendations and toxicity management guidelines for immune -mediated 
reactions, for infusion- related reactions, and for non -immune -mediated reactions are detailed in  
Appendix 1.   
In addition, management guidelines for adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are detailed in 
appendix 1. All toxicities will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03.  
7. RESTRICTIONS DURING THE STUDY AND CONCOMITANT 
TREATMENT(S) 
7.1 Restrictions during the study  
The following restrictions apply while the patient is receiving study treatment and for the specific times 
before and after:  
− Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non -sterilized male 
partner must use at least 1 highly  effect ive method of contraception ( Table 3 ) from the time of 
screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the last dose of 
durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy. Non -steriliz ed male partners of a female 
patient must use male condom plus spermicide throughout this period. Cessation of birth control 
after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.  Not engaging in sexual 
activity for the total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is a n acceptable 
practice; however, periodic  abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not 
acceptable methods of birth control.  Female patients should also refrain from breastfeeding 
throughout this period.  
N.B Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (ie, 
bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or post -menopausal.   
Women will be considered post -menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months 
without an alternative medical cause.  The following age- specific requirements apply:  
• Women <50 years of age would be considered post -menopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal 
treatments and if they have  luteinizing hormone and follicle -stimulating hormone 
levels in the post -menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical 
sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).  
• Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post -menopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal 
treatments, had radiation -induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, had

 chemotherapy -induced menopause with last menses >1 year ago, or underwent 
surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or 
hysterectomy).  
Highly effective methods of contraception, defined as one that results in a low failure rate (ie, 
less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are described in Table 3.  Note that 
some contraception methods are not considered highly effective (e.g. male or female condom 
with or without spermicide; female cap, diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non-
copper containing intrauterine device; progestogen -only o ral hormonal contraceptive pills 
where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action [excluding Cerazette/desogestrel 
which is considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined oral contraceptive pills). 
Table  3 Highly Effective methods of c ontraception (<1% failure rate)  
Barrier/Intrauterine methods  Hormonal Methods  
• Copper T intrauterine device  
• Levonorgesterel -releasing intrauterine 
system (eg, Mirena®)a 
 • Etonogestrel implants: e.g. Implanon or 
Norplan  
• Intravaginal device: e.g. ethinylestra diol 
and etonogestrel

Depo -Provera  
• Normal and low dose combined oral 
contraceptive pill  
• Norelgestromin/ethinylestradiol  
transdermal system  
• Cerazette (desogestrel)  
a This is also considered a hormonal method  
 
7.2 Concomitant treatment(s)  
The Princip al Investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from the 
time of screening until the end of the clinical  phase of the study (final study visit).  Any concomitant 
medication(s), including herbal pre parations, taken during the study will be recorded in the electronic 
medical record .   
Restricted, prohibited, and permitted concomitant medications are described in the follo wing tables.   
7.2.1 Permitted concomitant medications  
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments (e.g., acetaminophen, 
diphenhydramine) deemed necessary to provide adequate prophylactic or supportive care except for 
those medications identified as “excluded” as listed in Section 7.2 .2.

8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
8.1 Schedule of study procedures  
Before study entry, throughout the study, and following study drug discontinuation, various clinical and 
diagnostic laboratory evaluations are outlined.  The purpose of obtaining these detailed measurements 
is to ensure adequate safety and tolerability assessments.  Clinical evaluations and laboratory studies 
may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.   
8.1.1 Screening Phase  
Screening procedures will be  performed up to 28 days before Day 1, unless otherwise specified.  All 
subjects must first read, understand, and sign the IRB  -approved ICF before any study- specific screening 
procedures are performed.  After signing the ICF, completing all screening proc edures, and being 
deemed eligible for entry, subjects will be enrolled in the study.  Procedures that are performed prior to 
the signing of the ICF and are considered standard of care may be used as screening assessments if they 
fall within the 28 -day screening window. Refer to the Study Calendar for complete list of all the 
procedures that will be performed during the Screening Visit.  
2016 -0902 
5 October 2018 
43 
  
43 
 8.1.2 Treatment Phase  
Procedures to be conducted during the treatment phase of the study are presented in the Schedule of 
Assessments.  Screening procedures performed within 7 days  of Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) do not need to 
be repeated on C1D1.  
8.1.3 End of Treatment  
End of treatment is defined as the last planned dose of tremelimumab and durvalumab.  This will be 
followed by physician’s choice of systemic therapy, followed by standard of care surgical intervention.  
Any further adjuvant therapy is at the discretion of the treating physician.  Also, should the treating 
physician deem it is in the patient’s best interest to proceed with surger y after the completion of the 2 
doses each of tremelimumab and durvalumab, the physician may proceed with surgery with adjuvant 
therapies as per physician discretion .  
All subjects will be followed until the time of breast surgery . 
8.2 Description of study procedures  
8.2.1 Medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram, weight and vital signs  
Findings from medical history (obtained at screening) and physical examination shall be given a baseline 
grade according to the procedure for AEs. Increases in severity of pre -existing conditions during the 
study will be considered AEs, with resolution occurring when the grade returns to the pre -study grade 
or below.  
Physical examinations will be performed on study days noted in the Schedule of Assessments . 
8.2.2 Physical examination  
Physical examinations will be performed accordi ng to the assessment schedule.   Full physical 
examinations will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat and the respiratory, 
cardiovascular, GI, urogenital, musculoskeletal, n eurological, dermatological, hematologic/lymphatic, 
and endocrine systems.  Height will be measured at Screening only.  Targeted physical examinations are 
to be utilized by the Investigator on the basis of clinical observations and symptomatology.  Situations 
in which physical examination results should be reported as AEs are described in S ection 10 .   
8.2.3 Electrocardiograms  
Resting 12- lead ECGs will be recorded at screening and as clinically indi cated throughout the study .  
ECGs should be obtained after the pa tient has been in a supine position for 5  minutes and recorded while 
the patient remains in that position.  
At Screening, a single ECG will be obtained on which QTcF must be <470 ms.  If an ECG is interpreted 
to be a prolonged QT interval, 2 additional ECGs  will be obtained and the PI will then evaluate all 3 
ECGs to determine whether the patient should be excluded.  
2016 -0902 
5 October 2018 
44 
  
44 
 In case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTcF value >470  ms, 2  additional 12-
lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief p eriod (eg, 30 minutes) to confirm the finding.   
Situations in which ECG results should be reported as AEs are described in Section 10.0.   
8.2.4 Vital signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure [BP], pulse, temperature, and respiration rate) will be evaluated accordi ng to 
the assessment schedules.   
On infusion days, patients will be monitored during and after infusion of durvalumab + tremelimumab 
as presented in the bulleted list below.   
BP will be measured using a semi -automatic BP recording device with an appropriate cuff size, after the 
patient has rested for at least 5 minutes.  BP and pulse will be collected from patients receiving 
durvalumab + tremelimumab treatment before, during, and after each infusion at the following times 
(based on a 60- minute infusion):   
Prior to the beginning of the infusion (measured once from approximately 30 minutes before up to 0 
minutes [ie, the beginning of the infusion]).   
Halfway through  the infusion ( approximately 30 minutes ± 10 minutes ).   
At the end of the infusion (approximat ely 60  minutes ±  10 minutes) , 30 minutes, and 60 minutes after 
the infusion (i.e. 90 and 120 minutes from the start of the infusion) (±10 minutes) – for the first infusion 
only and then for subsequent infusions as clinically indicated.   
A 1-hour observati on period is r equired  after the first infusion of durvalumab and tremelimumab. If no 
clinically significant infusion reactions are observed during or after the first cycle, subsequent i nfusion 
observation periods can be at the Investigator’s discretion (su ggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab 
and tremelimumab infusion).   
If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then BP and pulse measurements should follow the 
principles as described above or be taken more frequently if clinically indicated.  The da te and time of 
collection and measurement will be recorded on the appropriate electronic medical record .  Additional 
monitoring with assessment of vital signs is at the discretion of the Investigator per standard clinical 
practice or as clinically indicate d.   
Situations in which vital signs results should be reported as AEs are described in Section  10.3.  A 
complete physical examination will be performed and will include an assessment of the following (as 
clinically indicated): general appearance, respirat ory, cardiovascular, abdomen, skin, head and neck 
(including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculo- skeletal (including spine and 
extremities), genital/rectal, and neurological systems and at screening only, height.

 8.2.5 Clinical laborato ry tests  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed (see the Schedule of Assessments) : 
• Coagulation parameters: Activated partial thromboplastin time and International normali zed ratio to 
be assessed at baseline and as clinically indicated  
• Pregnancy test (female subjects of childbearing potential only)  
o Urine human chorionic gonadotropin

8.3.1 Tumor biopsies and surgical specimen  
All patients will have biopsies performed before starting treatment with tremelimumab + 
durvalumab and post -treatment with tremelimumab + durvalumab (before starting neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy).  These biopsies will be obtained by core needle using a needle gauge of 14 or 
larger, with up to five cores obtained at each time point.  Surgical resection specimens will be 
obtained with the amount of tissue provided determined by the attendi ng breast pathologist 
performing the gross sectioning at the time of surgical resection.  
All samples will be collected and analyzed as per a separate IRB -approved lab protocol (PA13 -
0291). The Immunotherapy Platform will perform immune monitoring, includin g but not 
limited to evaluation of CD4 and CD8 T cells in available tumor samples as previously 
published (Liakou et al 2008; Carthon et al 2010; Tang et al 2013; Chen et al 2014; Eng et al 
2015; Chen et al 2016; Subudhi et al 2016; Gao et al 2016). 
8.3.2 Periph eral blood and serum samples  
Multiple blood draws will be required for this trial  (pre-treatment, post -treatment, at time of 
surgery).   All blood collections will be compliant with the institutional safety standards and 
will not exceed the maximum blood d raw per venipuncture policy .  All samples will be collected 
and analyzed as per a separate IRB -approved lab protocol (PA13- 0291). The Immunotherapy 
Platform will perform immune monitoring, including but not limited to evaluation of CD4 and 
CD8 T cells in a vailable blood samples as previously published (Liakou et al 2008; Carthon et 
al 2010; Tang et al 2013; Chen et al 2014; Eng et al 2015; Chen et al 2016; Subudhi et al 2016; 
Gao et al 2016).  
9. DISEASE EVALUATION AND METHODS  
As this is a pre -surgical pilot s tudy, evaluations will be done primarily by mammogram and 
breast ultrasound at baseline and then by ultrasound at the completion of the 2 cycles of 
investigational therapy.  
At the time of surgery the residual tissue will be described by Residual Cancer Bur den (RCB)  
(Symmans et al 2007) . The RCB is a continuous variable derived from the primary tumor 
dimensions, cellularity of the tumor bed, and axillary nodal burden. RCB can be divided into 
four classes (RCB -0 to RCB -III) and will be collected as part of th e study.  
RCB -0 (pCR), Minimal RCB (RCB -I), Moderate RCB (RCB -II), and Extensive RCB (RCB -
III) 
The following parameters are required from pathologic examination in order to calculate  
2016 -0902 
5 October 2018 
48 
  
48 
 Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) after neoadjuvant treatment:  
 
1. The largest two dimensions (mms) of the residual tumor bed in the breast (largest tumor 
bed if multicentric disease)  
2. Submission of the entire largest cross -sectional area of the residual tumor bed for 
histologic mapping, with specific identification of those slides  in the pathology report 
(e.g. "the largest cross -sectional area of primary tumor bed was submitted in cassettes 
A5 - A9")  
• If the residual tumor is large (i.e. largest diameter > 5 cm), then at least 5 
representative cassettes from the largest cross -sectional area are sufficient, but 
should be identified in the original pathology report (e.g. "representative sections 
from the largest cross - sectional area of primary tumor bed were submitted in 
cassettes A5 -  A9")  
3. Histologic assessment of the percentage of the tumor bed area that contains carcinoma 
(all carcinoma, i.e. invasive and in situ), select one of the following:  
0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%  
 
• To assess cellularity it is helpful to scan across the sections of tumor bed and 
then estimate the average cellularity from the different microscopic fields.  
• When estimating percentage cancer cellularity in any microscopic field, compare 
the involved area with obvious standards, e.g. more or less than half, one quarter, 
one fifth , one tenth, one twentieth, etc.  
• Expect there to be variable cellularity within the cross section of any tumor bed, 
but estimate the overall cellularity from the average of the estimates in different 
microscopic fields of the tumor bed. 
• e.g. if cellula rity in different fields of the tumor bed were estimated as 20%, 10%, 
20%, 0%, 20%, 30%, then an average estimate of overall cellularity would be 
20%. 
 
4. Histologic estimate of the percentage of the carcinoma in the tumor bed that is in situ, 
select one o f the following:  
0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%  
5. The number of positive (metastatic) lymph nodes  
6. The largest diameter (mm) of the largest nodal metastasis  
The R CB can be accessed online: www.mdanderson.org/breastcancer_R CB.  The R CB will be 
determined using this online calculator and documented by the study staff in the patient’s 
electronic medical record as part of the off study note.

 10. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
The Pri ncipal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study is familiar with 
the content of this section.  
10.1   Safety Parameters  
10.1.1  Definition of adverse events  
The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for Good Clini cal Practice (GCP) E6 
(R1) defines an AE as:  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product.  
An AE includes but is not lim ited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s pre -existing 
condition. An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG finding) that requires an action or 
intervention by the investigator, or a finding judged by the investigator to represent a c hange beyond the 
range of normal physiologic fluctuation, should be reported as an AE.  
Adverse events may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after initial receipt of investigational product) 
or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment -emergent AE is any new  sign or symptom, disease, or other 
untoward medical event that begins after written informed consent has been obtained but before the 
subject has received investigational product. Only AEs related to study drug ( durvalumab + 
tremelimumab ) will be followed .  Non- treatment -emergent AEs will not be followed.  In addition, AEs 
attributable to the preplanned neoadjuvant chemotherapy or surgery will not be collected.  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non- serious AEs.  
10.1.2  Definition of serious adverse e vents  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., screening, run- in, treatment, 
wash -out, follow -up), at any dose of the study drugs that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:  
Results in death  
Is immediately life- threa tening 
Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect in offspring of the subject  
2016 -0902 
5 October 2018 
50 
  
50 
 Is an important medical event tha t may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in this situation. Examples of medicall y important events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalizations; or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse  (21 CFR 312.32) . 
Important medica l events, as defined above, also may be considered SAEs. Any important medical event 
can and will  be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by the Principal  Investigator or The University 
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center’s IND Office.  
All events occur ring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must be 
reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlines in the “The University 
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting 
Serious Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”. Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, 
all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 
5 working days of knowl edge or the event).  
All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, must have a 
written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety 
Project Manager in the IND Office.  
Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SA E application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting to 
the IND Office and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center IRB.  
SAEs will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific interventio n, until 90 days after the 
last dose of study drug (durvalumab + tremelimumab ), unless the participant withdraws consent. 
SAEs must be followed until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory tests have returned to baseline, 
progression of the event has  stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the 90 day time period that are related to the 
study treatment must be reported to the IND Office. This may include development of a secondary 
malignancy.  
Reporting to FDA:  
SAEs will be forwarded to the FDA by the IND Sponsor (Safety Project Manager IND Office) according 
to 21 CFR 312.32.  
The Principal Investigator and research team will ensure SAEs are reported according to the Code of 
Federal Regulations, Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and 
Institutional Review Board policy.

 10.1.3  The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be 
assessed by the investigator(s) and communicated to AstraZeneca.  Durvalumab + 
tremelimumab adverse events of special interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the Investigational Product and may require clo se monitoring and rapid communication 
by the investigator to AstraZeneca/ MedImmune . An AESI may be serious or non- serious. The rapid 
reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand 
them in association with the use of this investigational product.  
AESIs for durvalumab and tremelimumab include but are not limited to events with a potential 
inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or 
interventions such as  steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. These AESIs 
are being closely monitored in clinical studies with durvalumab monotherapy and combination therapy. 
An immune -related adverse event (irAE) is defined as an adverse event that is associated with drug 
exposure and is consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear 
alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used 
to support an irAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, 
metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the irAE.  
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an irAE, the Investigator 
should promptly conta ct Dr. Litton and/or Dr. Mittendorf . 
AESIs observed with durvalumab and tremelimumab include:  
• Colitis  
• Pneumonitis  
• ALT/AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicity  
• Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (i.e. events of encephalitis, peripheral motor and sensory  
neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia gravis)  
• Endocrinopathy (i.e. events of hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hyper - and 
hypothyroidism)  
• Dermatitis  
• Nephritis  
• Pancreatitis  (or labs suggestive of pancreatitis -  increased serum lipase , incre ased serum

 Further information on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms) can be found in the current versi on of the 
durvalumab and tremelimumab Investigator Brochure. For durvalumab  and tremelimumab, AESIs will 
comprise the following:    
Pneumonitis  
AEs of pneumonitis are also of interest for AstraZeneca, as pneumonitis has been observed with use of 
anti-PD-1 mAbs (but not with anti -PD-L1 mAbs).  Initial work -up should include a high- resolution CT 
scan, ruling out infection, and pulse oximetry.  Pulmonary consultation is highly recommended. 
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune- related AEs (irAE s) including pneumonitis are 
provided in Appendix  1.   
Infusion reactions 
AEs of infusion reactions (also termed infusion -related reactions) are of special interest to AstraZeneca 
and are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring from  the start of IP infusion up to 
48 hours after the infusion start time.  For all infusion reactions ,  SAEs should be reported to AstraZeneca 
Patient safety as described in Section 10.3.   
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as inf usion- related reactions have been reported with anti -PD-L1 and 
anti-PD-1 therapy ( Brahmer et  al 2012).  As with the administration of any foreign protein and/or other 
biologic agents, reactions following the infusi on of mAbs can be caused by various mechanisms, 
including acute anaphylactic (IgE -mediated) and anaphylactoid reactions against the mAbs and serum 
sickness.  Acute allergic reactions may occur, may be severe, and may result in death.  Acute allergic 
reacti ons may include hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respiratory failure, urticaria, pruritus, 
angioedema, hypotonia, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, 
hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, and unresponsiveness.  Guidelines for t he management of patients with 
hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) and infusion- related reactions are provided in 
Appendix  1.    
Hepatic function abnormalities (hepatotoxicity)  
Hepatic function abnormality is defined as any increase in ALT o r AST to greater than 3  × ULN and 
concurrent increase in total bilirubin to be greater than 2 × ULN.  Concurrent findings are those that 
derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other.  Follow -
up investigatio ns and inquiries will be initiated promptly by the investigational site to determine whether 
the findings are reproducible and/or whether there is objective evidence that clearly supports causation 
by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction  with distended gallbladder) or an agent other 
than the IP.  Guidelines for management of patients with hepatic function abnormality are provided in 
Appendix  1.   
Lab abnormalities meeting the Potential Hy’s Law criteria (increase in serum ALT or AST ≥ 3 x  ULN 
together with total bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN, irrespective of serum alkaline phosphatase, at any point during 
the study following the start of the immunotherapy agent) or Hy’s Low (increase in serum ALT or AST 
2016 -0902 
5 October 2018 
53 
  
53 
 ≥ 3 x ULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN, where no other reason can be found to explain the 
combination of increases, for example, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase indicating cholestasis, viral 
hepatitis, or another suspect drug) will be handled as per Astra -Zeneca standard operating proce dures  
(Appendix 1) . 
Gastrointestinal disorders  
Diarrhea/colitis is the most commonly observed treatment emergent SAE when tremelimumab is used 
as monotherapy.  In rare cases, colon perforation may occur that requires surgery (colectomy) or can 
lead to a fatal outcome if not properly managed.  Guidelines on management of diarrhea and colitis in 
patients receiving tremelimumab are provided in Appendix 1.  
Endocrine disorders  
Immune -mediated endocrinopathies include hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hype r- and 
hypothyroidism.  Guidelines for the management of patients with immune -mediated endocrine events 
are provided in Appendix 1 . 
Pancreatic disorders  
Immune -mediated pancreatitis includes autoimmune pancreatitis, and lipase and amylase elevation.  
Guide lines for the management of patients with immune- mediated pancreatic disorders are provided in 
Appendix  1. 
Neurotoxicity  
Immune -mediated nervous system events include encephalitis, peripheral motor and sensory 
neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia g ravis.  Guidelines for the management of patients with 
immune -mediated neurotoxic events are provided in Appendix 1.  
Nephritis  
Consult with Nephrologist.  Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be related to changes in renal 
function (e.g. routine urinaly sis,  elevated serum BUN and creatinine, decreased creatinine clearance, 
electrolyte imbalance, decrease in urine output, proteinuria, etc .).  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, 
infectio ns etc.) . 
Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear alternative etiology even for low grade events 
(Grade 2 ), in order to prevent potential progression to higher grade event.   Guidelines for the 
management of patients with immune -mediated neur otoxic events are provided in Appendix  1. 
10.1.4  Immune -related adverse events  
Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab  and tremelimumab leading to T -cell activation and 
proliferation, there is a possibility of observing irAEs during the conduct of this study.  Potential irAEs 
may be similar to those seen with the use of ipilimumab, BMS -936558 (anti -PD-1 mAb), and BMS -
936559 (anti -PD-L1 mAb) and may include immune -mediated enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis 
2016 -0902 
5 October 2018

54 
 (hepatotoxicity), pneumonitis, and endocrinopathi es (Hodi et al 2010, Brahmer et al 2012, Topalian et 
al 2012) .  These AEs are inflammatory in nature and can affect any organ.  With anti -PD-L1 and anti -
CTLA -4 combination therapy, the occurrence of overlapping or increasing cumulative toxicities that 
include irAEs could potentially occur at higher frequencies than with either durvalumab or 
tremelimumab monotherapy.  Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the 
absence of an alternate etiology (eg, infection or PD), an immune -related etiology should be considered 
for signs or symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy.  In 
addition to the dose modification guidelines provided in Table 1 , it is recommended that irAEs are 
managed according to the general treatment guidelines outlined for ipilimumab (Weber et al 2012) .  
These guidelines recommend the following:  
• Patients should be evaluated to identify any alternative etiology. 
• In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all events of an inflammatory 
nature should be considered immune related.  
• Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low -grade events.  
• Systemic corticosteroids should be considered for a persistent low -grade 
event or for a severe event.  
• More potent immunosuppressives  should be considered for events not 
responding to systemic steroids (eg, infliximab or mycophenolate).  
10.2 If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an AE being an irAE, the Investigator 
should immediately contact Dr. Litton and/or Dr. Mittendorf .    Assessment of 
safety parameters  
10.2.1  Assessment of severity  
Assessment of severity is one of the responsibilities of the investigator in the evaluation of  
AEs and SAEs. Severity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03.  
The determination of severity for all other events not listed in the CTCAE should be made by 
the investigator based upon medical judgment and the severity categories of Grade 1 to 5 as  
defined below.  
Grade 1 (mild)   An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatme nt or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally 
interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
 
Grade 2 (moderate)  An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activi ties of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm 
to the subject. 
2016 -0902 
5 October  2018  
55 
  
 
55 
 Grade 3 (severe)  An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the 
clinical status of the subject.  
 
Grade 4 (life threatening)  An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with  
an imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that 
affect or limit the ability of the subject to  perform activities of daily 
living (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc).  
 
Grade 5 (fatal)   Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.  
 
It is important to distinguish between serious criteria and severity of an AE. A Grade 3 AE need not 
necessarily be considered an SAE. For example, a Grade 3 headache that persists for several hours may 
not meet the regulatory definition of an SAE and would be considered a nonserious event, whereas a 
Grade 2 seizure resulting in a hospital admission would be considered an SAE.  
10.3 Recording of adverse events and serious adverse events  
Adverse events will be recorded using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects 
the event. Adverse events will be assessed by the investigator for severity, relationship t o the 
investigational product, possible etiologies, and whether the event meets criteria of an SAE and therefore 
requires immediate notification to AstraZeneca/MedImmune Patient Safety.  
The following variables will be collected and recorded in RedCap for each AE:  
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date  when the AE started and stopped  
• Changes in NCI CTCAE grade and the maximum CTC grade attained  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  
• Investigator causality rating against durvalumab or tremelimumab (yes or no)  
• Action taken with r egard to durvalumab + tremelimumab/comparator/combination agent  
• Outcome  
 
In addition, the following variables will be collected and recorded in RedCap for SAEs as applicable:  
• Date AE met criteria for serious AE  
• Date Investigator became aware of serious AE  
• AE is serious due to  <<criteria>>  
• Date of hospitalization  
• Date of discharge 
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Autopsy performed  
2016 -0902 
5 October  2018  
56 
  
 
56 
 • Description of AE  
• Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)  
 
Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the 
study. 
10.3.1  Study recording period and follow -up for adverse events and serious adverse events  
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded from time of first protocol intervention , 
throughout t he treatment period and including the follow -up period (90 +/ -7 days after the last dose 
of durvalumab + tremelimumab).  
During the course of the study all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each subject. 
Every effort should be made to obtain a r esolution for all events, even if the events continue after 
discontinuation/study completion.  
If a subject discontinues from treatment for reasons other than disease progression, and therefore 
continues to have tumor assessments, drug or procedure -related SAEs must be captured until the patient 
is considered to have confirmed PD and will have no further tumor assessments.  
The investigator is responsible for following all SAEs until resolution, until the subject  returns to 
baseline status, or until the condi tion has stabilized with the expectation that it will  remain chronic, even 
if this extends beyond study participation.  
Follow -up of unresolved adverse events  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last visit  (90 days post End of Treatment)  in the study are 
followed up by the invest igator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording.  After 
90 days, only subjects with ongoing investigational product -related SAEs will continue to be followed 
for safety . 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune and the IND Office retain the right to request additional information for any 
subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 
Post study events 
 
After the subject has been permanently withdrawn from the study, there is no obligation for the 
investigator to active ly report information on new AE or SAEs occurring in former study subjects after 
the 90- day safety follow -up period for patients treated with durvalumab + tremelimumab.  However, if 
an investigator learns of any SAEs, including death, at any time after the subject has been permanently 
withdrawn from study, and he/she considers there is a reasonable possibility that the event is related to 
study treatment, the investigator should notify the study The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer 
Center  and AstraZen eca/MedImmune Drug Safety.

 10.3.2  Investigator Communications with AstraZeneca  
All SAE re ports and accompanying cover pages will be sent, by way of email, to AstraZeneca’s 
designated mailbox: AEMailb oxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com . 
* A cover page  should accompany the MD Anderson IRB SAE form indicating the following: 
• “Notification from an Investigator Initiated  Study”  
• The MD Anderson  IND number assigned by the FDA  
• The investigator’s name and address  
• The trial name/title and AstraZeneca ISS reference number (ESR -##-#####)  
* The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  must also indicate, either in the SAE report or 
the cover page, the causality  of events in relation to all study medications  and if the SAE is related to 
disease progression , as determined by the principal investigator.  
* Send SAE report and accompanying cover page by way of email to AstraZeneca’s designated 
mailbox:     AEMailboxClinicalTrialTCS@astrazeneca.com  
 
If a non- serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow -up information must also be 
provided to AstraZeneca.  
Serious adverse events that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA still need to be reported to 
AstraZeneca preferably using the MedDRA coding language for serious adverse events.  This 
information should be reported on a monthly basis and under no circumstance less frequently than 
quarterly.   
10.3.2.1  Reporting of deaths  
All deaths that occur d uring the study, or within the protocol -defined 90- day post -last dose of 
durvalumab + tremelimumab safety follow -up period must be reported as follows:  
• Death that is clearly the result of disease progression should be documented 
but should not be reported as an SAE.  
• Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease 
under study, the AE causing the death must be reported to as a SAE within 
24 hours  (see Section 10.3.2 for further details).  The report should contain 
a comment regarding  the co -involvement of progression of disease, if 
appropriate, and should assign main and contributory causes of death.   
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE.   
2016 -0902

58 
  
 
58 
 Deaths that occur following the protocol -defined 90 -day post -last-dose of MEDI4736 and/or 
Tremelimumab  safety follow -up period will be documented, but will not be reported as an SAE. If the 
death is possibly related to durvalumab and/or tremelimumab, it will be reported as an SAE.  
10.3.3  Other events requiring reporting  
10.3.3.1  Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab in excess of that 
specified in the Investigator’s Brochure, unless otherwise specified in this protocol.  
Any overdose of a study subject with durvalumab + tremelimumab, with or without associated 
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to The University of 
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and AstraZeneca/MedImmune Patient Safety or designee using the 
designated Safety e- mailbox (see Secti on 10 .3.2 for contact information). If the overdose results in an 
AE, the AE must also be recorded as an AE (see Section 10.3). Overdose does not automatically make 
an AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose are serious, for example death or ho spitalization, 
the event is serious and must be recorded and reported as an SAE (see Section 10.3  and Section 10.3.2). 
There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose of durvalumab or tremelimumab.  
The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.  
10.3.3.2  Hepatic function abnormality  
Hepatic function abnormality (as defined in Section 10.1.3.) in a study subject, with or without associated 
clinical manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic function abnormal” within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  and 
AstraZeneca/MedImmune Patient Safety using the designated Safety e -mailbox (see Section 10.3.2 for 
contact information), unless a definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality (e.g., cholelithiasis or 
bile duct obstruction) that is unrelated to investigational product has been confirmed.  
• If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is unrelated 
to investigational product , the decision to continue dosing of the study subject will be based on 
the clinical judgment of the investigator.  
• If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, dosing of the study 
subject must be interrupted immediately. Follow -up investigations and inquiries must be 
initiated by the investigational site without delay.  
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by the investigator and evaluated 
by the The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  and AstraZeneca/MedImmune.

 10.3.3.3  Pregnancy  
10.3.3.4  Maternal exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the IPs should be discontinued immediately.   
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital abnormalities or birth defects 
and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without 
complications should not be handled as AEs .  The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, 
elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up 
and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study.   
If any pregnancy occur s in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel should 
inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately, but no later than 24 
hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it.   
The designated AstraZen eca representative will work with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 to 5 calendar days for 
SAEs and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.   
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.   
10.3.4  Paternal exposure  
Male patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 180 days 
after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy , whichever is th e longer time 
period.   
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 90 days after the last dose should, 
if possible, be followed up and documented.   
Where a report of pregnancy is received, prior to obtaining information about the pregnancy, the 
Investigator must obtain the consent of the pa tient’s partner.  Therefore, the local study team should 
adopt the generic ICF template in line with local procedures and submit it to the relevant Ethics 
Committees (ECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) prior to use.

 11. STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SI ZE 
DETERMINATION 
11.1 Description of analysis sets  
11.1.1  Safety analysis set  
All patients who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety monitoring 
and safety analysis.  
11.1.2   Efficacy analysis set  
All enrolled patients will be included in the p rimary feasibility analysis.  Only patients with 
surgical specimens and immune measures will be included in secondary and exploratory 
analyses requiring that information. 
11.2  Goals  
Since this combination has not been previously evaluated in the presurgical se tting in hormone 
receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, this trial will: 1) assess the feasibility of 
enrolling patients onto a trial evaluating investigational agents prior to initiating standard 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 2) determine the safety of durvalumab and tremelimumab in 
patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, as well as 3) gather 
preliminary immunologic information for designing future trials.   
11.3 Endpoints  
11.3.1  Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoints will be  
: 
1. Feasibility.  This will be measured by 2 achievements.  If both are met, then upfront 
treatment with durvalumab plus tremelimumab will be feasible for future trials in these 
breast cancer patients. Otherwise, other strategies for implementing these treatments will 
need to be designed.  The 2 measures are:  
 
a. Patients are willing to enroll: This will be established if we can enroll all 15 
patients within 12 months of starting the study.  The start date for measuring 
feasibility will be the date the first patient is screened.  
b. Patients can complete the protocol: If at least 10 patients complete the study and 
have available immune data the trial meets this feasibility criterion.  If fewer than 
8 finish then this dose/schedule is infeasible. If 8 or 9 complete the study with 
immune data then clinical judgment combining toxicity, efficacy, and physician 
2016 -0902

61 
  
 
61 
 experience with the protocol will be used to determine whether adjustments to 
the treatment are needed before a future trial.  
 
2. Adverse events will be recorded according to CTCAE 4.03.  
 
11.3.2  Secondary Endpoint  
Immune and molecular measures in peripheral blood and tumor tissues pre and post treatment . 
 
11.3.3  Exploratory Endpoint  
Pathologic response at surgery will be recorded for each patient . 
11.4 Sample Size Considerations  
The selection  of 15 patients for this pilot trial is to provide preliminary information for 
feasibility and safety, as well as to have at least 10 patients with full immune measures pre and 
post treatment for hypothesis generation and testing in the next trial.  An acc rual rate of 2 
patients per month is anticipated.  A maximum sample size of 15 patients will be enrolled.  No 
hypotheses will be formally tested, but with 15 patients we can determine whether an 
unreasonable proportion of patients have high grade toxicitie s and gather estimates of immune 
and molecular changes in tumor and peripheral blood.  These measures will be used to design a 
larger, hypothesis -driven trial.  
11.5 Interim Analysis: Safety Monitoring  
Any patient who received the first dose of study medication will be included in the ongoing 
safety monitoring.  For trial monitoring and decisions about future trials, a patient will be 
determined to have an extreme toxicity (ETOX) if either condition is met: 
• The patient experiences any grade 3 or higher adverse ev ent (AE) that is possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to therapy received on this protocol and occurs up to 
90 days after the last dose of therapy  (durvalumab + tremelimumab ).  As an 
exception, any such AE that is potentially treatable with steroids w ill only count as 
an ETOX if it does not improve to grade 1 or better within 2 weeks.  
• The patient has a delay in surgery of 6 weeks or more due to AE, even if that AE does 
not meet the definition of ETOX.  
 
Based on the method of Thall (1995)9, we will monitor ETOX continually after the 5th patient 
receives treatment.  Continuous monitoring will occur monthly. We assume Ɵ T ~ beta (0. 20, 
0.8) for the current study, where Ɵ T is the probability of a patient experiencing an ETOX.  Our 
stopping rule is given by the following probability statement: P T(ƟT>0.20 | data) > 0. 90.  That 
is, we will stop the trial if, at any  time during the study, we determine that there is more than an 
90% chance that the ETOX rate is more than 20 %. 
 
The stopping boundaries for this toxicity rule are to terminate the trial if the number of patients 
with ETOX compared to the number of patient s on trial exceed the limits in table 1, with 
2016 -0902

62 
 operating characteristics for this rule in table 2.   After 5 patients, this table will be consulted 
prior to enrolling each patient.  Enrollment will not require waiting for complete information 
for the previous patient, unless an ETOX in that patient would result in hitting the stopping rule. 
Boundaries and operating characteristics were calculated in Multc Lean v2.1.

The Investigator is responsible for completing the summary report and submitting it to the IND 
Office Medical Monitor for review  and approval. A Feasibility/Safety summary will be 
submitted after the first 5 evaluable patients complete study treatment, and monthly  thereafter.  
11.6 Analysis Plan  
Feasibility will be assessed according to the endpoint definition provided above.  Additional ly, 
the total number of patients screened to achieve 15 enrolled patients will be reported.  Since it 
is not known whether durvalumab plus tremelimumab can be safely used in the presurgical 
setting in patients with HR+, HER2 - breast cancer, our other prima ry endpoint is safety.  
Adverse events will be tabulated by CTCAE grade and ETOX status.  A 95% credible interval 
will be presented for the ETOX rate among patients in the safety analysis set .  Surgery delay 
will be reported with the numbers of patients wi th any delay, as well as the median, IQR, min

 and max for delay times.  If 6 or more patients experience ETOX, then this combination will be 
determined to be too toxic for these patients.  
 
For blood and tumor measures, descriptive statistics including plot s, tabulations, mean, median 
and standard deviations will be used to summarize data.  Differences and/or percent changes 
will be calculated between pre-  and post -therapy samples from each patient and described as 
continuous measures.

Appendix 1.  Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -mediated, Infusion Related, and 
Non Immune -mediated Reactions (MEDI4736 Monotherapy or Combination therapy with 
Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab Monotherapy) 19 August 2016 Version  
Dose Modifications  Toxicity Management  
Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will be made to 
manage potential immune-related AEs based on severity of treatment -emergent 
toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.  
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study 
regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen for the following conditions:  
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10 mg of prednisone per 
day (or equivalent) within 12 weeks  after last dose of study drug/study 
regimen  
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -related AE 
following resumption of dosing  
Grad e 1 No dose modification 
Grade 2  Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to 
Grade ≤1.  
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4.  
Study drug/study regimen can be resumed once event stabilizes to 
Grade ≤1 after completion of s teroid taper.  
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or 
continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on the following conditions:  
1. The event stabilizes and is controlled.  
2. The patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treating 
physician’s clinical judgement.  It is recommended that management of irAEs follows the guidelines  presented in this 
table:  
− Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology 
(eg, disease progression, concomitant medications, and infections).  
− In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all events should be considered 
poten tially immune related.  
− Symptomatic and topical therapy should be considered for low -grade (Grade 
1 or 2, unless otherwise specified) events.  
− For persistent (>3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2) or severe (Grade ≥3) 
events, promptly start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent.  
− If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 days of 
taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone dose [eg, up to 2 to 
4 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of 
symptoms, t hen resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (>28  days of 
taper).  
− More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (eg,  infliximab) 
(also refer to the individual sections of the irAE for specific type of 
immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to 
systemic steroids.  
− Discontinuation of study drug/study regimen is not mandated for Grade 
3/Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumo r response 
(eg, inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease and lymph no des). 
Continuation of study drug/study regimen in this situation should be based 
upon a benefit/risk analysis for that patient.

− Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or 
ILD (new onset or worsening shortness of breath or cough). 
Patients should be evaluated with imaging and pulmonary 
function tests, including other diagnostic procedures as 
described below.  
− Initial work -up may include clinical evaluation, monitoring of 
oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), 
laboratory work -up, and high- resolution CT scan.  
Grade 1  
(asymptomatic, clinical 
or diagnostic 
observations only; 
interve ntion not 
indicated)  No dose modifications  required. 
However, consider holding study 
drug/study regimen dose as clinically 
appropriate and during diagnostic work -
up for other etiologies.  For Grade 1 (radiographic changes only) : 
− Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
laboratory work -up and then as clinically indicated.  
− Consider pulmonary and infectious disease consult.  
Grade 2  
(symptomatic; medical 
intervention indicated; 
limiting instrumental 
ADL)  Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1.  
• If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4.  
• If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then the decision to reinitiate study 
drug/study regimen will be based 
upon trea ting physician’s clinical 
judgment and after completion of 
steroid taper.  For Grade 2 (mild to moderate new symptoms) : 
− Monitor symptoms daily and consider hospitalization.  
− Promptly start systemic steroids (eg, prednisone 1 to 
2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent).  
− Reimage as clinically indicated.  
− If no improvement within 3 to 5 days, additional workup 
should be considered and prompt treatment with IV 
methylprednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg/day started  
− If still no improvement within 3 to 5 days despite IV 
methylprednisone at 2 to 4  mg/kg/day, promptly start 
immunosuppressive therapy such as TNF inhibitors

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes  
(such as Guillain -Barre

− The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is import ant, since certain patients 
may unpredictably experience acute decompensations that 
can result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. 
Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms 
that may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent 
dysphagia, rapidly progressive weakness, and signs of 
respiratory insufficiency or autonomic instability.  
− Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic 
syndromes or medications).  It should be noted that the 
diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes can be particularly challenging in patients with 
underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding 
effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the ne uraxis.

− Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (eg,  electromyogram and 
nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulatio n” 
if myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicated upon 
suspicion of such conditions and may be best facilitated by 
means of a neurology consultation.

2. Subject weight: 30 kg 
3. Dose for subject: 30 mg = 1 (mg/kg) × 30 (kg)  
4. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  
Dose (mL) = 30 mg / 20 (mg/mL) = 1.5 mL  
5. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation:  
Number of vials = 1.5 (mL) / 20.0 (mL/vial) = 1 vials

 Appendix 5. Tremelimumab DOSE VOLUME CALCULATIONS  
For tremelimumab flat dosing:  
1. Cohort dose: X mg 
2. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  
Dose (mL) = X mg / 20 (mg/mL)  
where 20 mg/mL is tremelimumab nominal concentration  
The corresponding volume of tremelimumab should be rounded to the nearest tenth mL (0.1 mL).  
3. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation is the next greatest whole number of 
vials from the following formula:  
Number of vials = Dose (mL) / 20 (mL/vial)  
Example:  
1. Cohort dose: 75 mg 
2. Dose to be added into infusion bag:  
Dose (mL) = 75 mg / 20 (mg/mL) = 3.8 mL  
3. The theoretical number of vials required for dose preparation:  
Number of vials = 3.8 (mL) / 20 (mL/vial) = 1 vial

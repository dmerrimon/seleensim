  Rationale for amendment: The purpose of this amendment is to decrease the duration of 
subject follow up after treatment has ended. Currently the protocol states that subjects will 
be followed for up to 3 years, this time will be changed to reflect that subjects will be 
followed for up to 2 years.  Given that the primary objective  has been met, the decrease in 
subject follow up will allow for subsequent study closure.

AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY This protocol amendment defines disease progression to correspond with the clinical assessments appropriate for the subject population. Disease progression can be determined by: (1) RECIST 1.1 criteria; (2) Clinical deterioration (3) Clinical progression (i.e. worsening of chest wall lesion). This allows for appropriate documentation of disease progression for subjects who end treatment and continue onto palliative care or hospice.  In addition to other administrative changes, an administrative letter from January 3, 2017, which defines the timeframe for ECHO or MUGO assessments as part of eligibility has been incorporated into this amendment.   SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
1. Defined disease progression as: (1) RECIST 1.1 criteria; (2) Clinical deterioration 
(3) Clinical progression in Section 2.4.1.1 
2. Section 4.4 edited to include definition of disease progression

4 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Study Synopsis  
This phase II, single- arm, multicenter  study will evaluate pembrolizumab therapy 
200 mg IV given every 3 weeks (Q3W) , following a single priming dose of 
cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV in patients with advanced  triple -negative breast 
cancer (TNBC)  who  have received at least one prior line of therapy . The primary 
objective is to estimate progression -free survival (PFS) for cyclophosphamide + 
pembrolizumab in advanced TNBC patients compared t o pembrolizumab alone 
(historical PFS = 1 .9 month s) [1].  A biologically -focused primary objective is to 
describe the reduction in regul atory T cells (Tregs) in TNBC patients receiving 
this combination. Secondary objectives include assessment s of overall response 
rate (ORR) per RECIST1.1, duration of response (DOR), di sease control rate  
(DCR ) and overall survival (OS) in this population receiving a single dose 
cyclophosphamide + pembrolizumab.  Determination of response to study 
treatment  based on immune- related response criteria ( irRECIST ) is an exploratory 
objective of this trial.  Patients will continue study therapy until disease progression and toxicity will be assessed during treatment via NCI -CTCAE 
criteria v4. In addition, tumor samples from archival diagnostic tissue or fresh 
biopsy material (optional pre and post dose biopsy ) and serial blood draws will be 
obtained for correlativ e biomarker studies.   
 Our hypothesis is that a single dose of cyclophosphamide given the day before initiation of pembrolizumab  every 3 weeks  will improve PFS  in advanced TNBC 
patients  by 1 month and  that a total of 36 evaluable patients will be needed t o 
detect a clinically -meaningful change in median PFS from 1.9 to 2.9 months. The 
goal of the proposed collateral biomarker research is to discover immunologic determinants of response to single- dose cyclophosphamide + pembrolizumab in 
this population. Our  group has found that the basal-like and claudin- low 
molecular subtypes (the two subtypes that comprise virtually all TNBC) are 
enriched in tumor- infiltrating immune cells with gene -expression patterns 
consistent with active immunosuppression ([ 2] and unpublished data]).  We 
anticipate that clinical response to programmed cell death protein 1 and ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) axis inhibition by pembrolizumab will be most pronounced in 
TNBC patients whose tumors have elicited an immune response that is actively suppressed through PD- 1/PD -L1 interaction. 
1.2 Disease  and Study  Background   
It is estimated that 200,000 women world-wide are diagnosed annually with TNBC  [3].  TNBC lacks expression of the estrogen and progesterone receptors 
(ER/PR) and the HER2 protein, and is associated with early and visceral recurrences, despit e sensitivity to cytotoxics  [4, 5]. In particular, TNBC can 
respond well to anthracyclines in combination with taxanes [ 6] or to taxanes  or 
platinums  as monotherapy [ 7], but the risks of relapse/recurrence remain  quite 
high. In the metastatic TNBC population and from first presentation of advanced

5 disease, median PFS with chemotherapy alone is ~5 -8 months with an OS of ~18 
months [ 8, 9]. Novel approaches are clearly needed. One exciting area worthy of 
further exploration is immunotherapy, and in particular agents that inhibit the PD-
1 and PD- L1. 
1.2.1 Anti -PD1 and PD- L1 Agents  in TNBC  
Anti-PD1 and PD-L1 agents have demonstrated exciting activity in several human 
cancers with an ORR  of just over 20% [ 10, 11] . Breast cancer has only recently 
been included in trials of immunomodulating agents, as this cancer has not been typically viewed as  immunosensitive.  In fact, intra- tumoral expression of PD1 
and PD-L1 has been shown to be associated with decreased survival in basal- like 
breast cancer [12, 13] and preliminary data in TNBC with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors have generated enthusiasm for this approach.  In the early -phase 
KEYNOTE -012 trial, treatment with the PD -1 inhibitor pembrolizumab 
demonstrated an ORR of 18.5% , including one complete response (CR)  in 32 
heavily pretreated patients with PD -L1-positiv e recurrent metastatic TNBC [1].  
The rate of stable disease  (SD) among 27 evaluable patients (median follow -up < 
10 months) was 25.9%, and median PFS was 1.9 months. Grade 3/4 adverse 
events (AEs) occurred in 15.6% of patients, and the most common AEs were arthralgia (18.8%), fatigue (18.8%), myalgia (15.6%), and nausea (15.6%). Clearly this agent is worthy of further study in TNBC.  While promising  the overall response rate (ORR) of 18.5% reported in TNBC is 
modest [ 1] .  This may be due to the presence of intra- tumoral regulatory T cells 
(Tregs), potent suppressors of the immune response [ 14]. In vitro, basal- like 
breast cancer cells induce Treg polarization of undifferentiated CD4+ T cells [ 15].  
Increased ratio of Treg to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Treg/CTL ratio) in breast tumors has been associated with decreased survival in multiple studies [ 16].   
1.2.2 Modulation of the immune microenvironment by cyclophosphamide  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of 
neoplastic transformation has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between  certain subsets of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies.  In particular,  the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / 
FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors.  
 The capacity of cyclophosphamide to deplete Tregs is long- established  [17].  It is 
important to note, however, that cyclophosphamide in combination with immunotherapy is not without risk.  A recent study showed that repeated doses of cyclophosphamide may worsen outcomes when combined with other immunomodulating agents. Compared to the clinical profile of the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab when administered as monotherapy, investigators reported reduced efficacy coupled with a doubling of toxicities when cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m
2 IV) was given on D1 followed by ipilimumab on D3 for each of 4

6 cycles in patients with metastatic melanoma.  In addition to depleting Treg s, 
cyclophosphamide may induce myeloid-derived suppressor cells and thereby 
promote tumor growth [ 18].  These effects have not been reported with 
cyclophosphamide given as a single dose prior to immunotherapy . Further, a 
single  low dose of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 prior to a novel multi-epitope 
renal cancer vaccine markedly enhanced the clinical vaccine response in patients who developed an active epitope- specific T cell response to vaccination [19].   
 While multiple dosing strategies have been shown to diminish circulating Treg numbers, a proper dosing strategy that does not 1) yield depletion of activated cytotoxic T cells and/or 2) cause unacceptable drug -related toxicity is important 
to define.  In one study of an allogeneic HER2- positive GM -CSF–secreting breast 
tumor vaccine, addition of 200 mg/m
2 cyclophosphamide had no impact on the 
rate of development of delayed -type hypersensitivity (a measure of effector T cell 
response), whereas a dose of 450mg/m2 was associated with diminished effector 
responses [ 20].  Anti-HER2 humoral immunity following vaccination was best 
enhanced with the lower cyclophosphamide dose.  In light of these data, we have chosen a one- time immune -priming  dose of 300 mg/m
2 to be given prior to the 
first cycle of pembrolizumab in this study . 
 We have found in preclinical studies that depleti on of Tregs by a drug -dependent 
genetic method or by a single infusion with low-dose cyclophosphamide results in improved survival and impaired tumor growth in a T11  murin e model of TNBC 
of the claudin-low molecular subtype [Vincent and Serody, unpublished data ].  
When Treg were depleted using a single administration of low-dose cyclophosphamide or using a genetic depletion method, tumor growth was impaired; however, all mice eventually succumbed to tumor.  Treg depletion with low-dose cyclophosphamide was markedly enhanced by concurrent treatment with anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 inhibitory antibodies; moreover, tumor impairment was pronounced and a small number of mice failed to develop tumor (3/20 in the combination treatment arm vs. 0/10 mice in the cyclophosphamide-only are and 0/6 mice in the untreated arm). Thus, we hypothesize that Treg depletion with a single priming dose of low-dose cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/m
2 
IV given prior to the first cycle of pembrolizumab (200 mg q3W) will provide additional therapeutic benefit in TNBC  compared to pembrolizumab alone. 
1.3 Pembrolizu mab  
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a potent and highly selective intravenous humanized mAb of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype that directly blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. This blockade enhances functional activity of the target lymphocytes to facilitate an antitumor immune response, leading to tumor regression and immune rejection of the tumor.  Keytruda
TM (Pembrolizumab) has recently been approved at a dose of 
2 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks in the United State s for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progressi on following 
ipilumumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.  Indications

7 currently under investigation by the manufacturer of pembrolizumab include non-
small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. In addition, preliminary data from the KEYNOTE-012 study of pembrolizumab has generated enthusiasm for further investigation of immune checkpoint inhibition as a treatment strategy for TNBC.  
1.3.1 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification 
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conduc ted to evaluate the 
safety and clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion 
of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, 
administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting toxicities were 
observed.  This first in human study of MK-3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).   No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 
mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.   Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK-3475 program has 
shown that a lower dose of MK-3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow 
systemic clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half- life (refer to 
IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target 
engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q 3W dosing schedule.   
 A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of MK -3475 were found to be dependent 
on body weight. The relationship between clearance and body weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for other antibodies and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body weights.  MK -3475 has been found to have a wide therapeutic range based 
on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5-fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
 The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of 
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
8 pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma 
patients, 2) the flat ex posure- response relationships of pembrolizumab for both 
efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by the population PK model) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the expos ure 
range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe. 
 
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for 
physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will 
also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
1.4 Correlative Studies  
Basal -like and claudin-low molecular subtypes of breast cancer are enriched in 
tumor- infiltrating immune cells with gene -expression patterns consistent with 
active immunosuppression ([2] and unpublished data]).  A single priming dose of cyclophosphamide + p embrolizumab  therapy may counteract the 
immunosuppressive microenvironment of TNBC and initiate a substantive antitumor response . The efficacy of this combination will likely correlate with the 
presence of a substantial, but suppressed, tumor immune infil trate. Correlative 
biomarker studies in this trial will investigate this hypothesis .  
 
Exploratory objectives based on serial blood collections and tumor samples will 
investigate whether the phenotype of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes, including 
delineatio n of effector and regulatory T cells, from the diagnostic biopsy will 
correlate with clinical benefit.  An evaluation of the predictive capacity of PD -L1 
expression, immune gene signatures, and a characterization of the change in phenotype in tumor- infiltra ting lymphocytes (TILs) before and after therapy will 
be explored .  In addition, we hope to define T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell 
receptor (BCR) re pertoire profiles associated  with clinical benefit. We 
hypothesize that each of the following: increased PD -L1 mRNA expression, 
effector immune infiltrate, clonality in TILs and decreased regulatory cell populations, will be associated with clinical benefit (eg, ORR, PFS, DOR,  CBR  
and OS).   Some or all of these correlative studies may be conducted under the auspices of the Merck sponsored UNC Immunotherapy PAtient Centered Translational

Pembrolizuma b 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion starting 
on Day 2 (D2) of the study (hematology labs must meet inclusion criteria to 
initiate therapy with pembrolizumab) .  Every effort  should be made to target 
infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min). The 
Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the pr eparation of the 
pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution. This manual is provided as a document separate from the protocol.

4.2.2.3 Rescue Medi cations and Supportive Care for Pembrolizu mab  
Supportive Care Guidelines  
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below l. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents if 
symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The tr eatment guidelines are 
intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.   Note:  if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined  below ). 
Refer to Section 4.2.2.2 for dose modifications.  
 It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.   
• Pneumonitis:  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti- inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid administration
. 
    
• Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).    
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, 
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
22 fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via  IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or 
higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule 
out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis  that persists greater than 3 days, administer 
oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that p ersists > 1 week, treat with 
intravenous steroids followed by high dose oral steroids.   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
 
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) 
or ≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA)  
 
o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade 3- 4 hyper glycemia associated with metabolic 
acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide.  
 
• Hypophysitis : 
 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms imp rove to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids 
followed by oral corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Patients should be monitor ed for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically 
during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders. 
 
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism): 
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta- blockers (e.g. propranolol) 
are suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therap y, with 
levothyroxine or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.

4.5 End of Treatment  
The end of treatment visit should only occur when patients permanently stop study treatment and should be performed 30 days (+/-10 days) after the last dose of study medication. Patients who have an ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) at this visit will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed irreversible by the investigator. 
  
4.6 Duration of Follow Up 
Subjects will be followed for up to 2 years after removal from study treatment or 
until death, whichever occurs first.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable 
adverse events  (AEs) will be followed until resolution or st abilization of the 
event(s) .   
 The long- term follow -up visit is defined as 90 days (+/- 15 days) after the last 
dose of treatment (see Section 6.1).  All adverse events and concomitant 
medications should be followed up until this initial long- term follow -up visit (90 
days after last pembrolizumab dose). Subsequent follow -up visits, defined as 
every 60 days thereafter (+/ - 15 days) for up to 2 years or until death (whichever 
is first) may be conducted via telephone.  These visits will be limited to history of any subsequent cancer treatments, an assessment of any  SAE’s considered to be 
possibly or probably related to study treatment until resolution, and survival status.  
4.7 Removal of Patients from Protocol Therapy 
Patients will be removed from protocol therapy and the PI notified when any of 
the criteria listed in section 4.4
 apply.  The reason for discontinuation of protocol 
therapy will be documented on the eCRF.   
 In case a patient decides to prematurely discontinue protocol therapy (“refuses  
treatment”), the patient should be asked if she or he may still be contacted for further scheduled study assessments. The outcome of that discussion should be documented in both the medical records and in the eCRF.

26 Excessive patient withdrawals from protocol therapy or from the study can render 
the study un-interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided. 
4.8 Study Withdrawal 
If a subject  decides to withdraw from the study (and not just from protocol 
therapy) all efforts should be made to complete and report study assessments as 
thoroughly as possible. The investigator shoul d contact the subject or a 
responsible relative by telephone or through a personal visit to establish as completely as possible the reason for the study withdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the subject ’s study withdrawal should be made with an 
explanation of why the patient is w ithdrawing from the study. If the reason for 
removal of a subject from the study is an adverse event, the principal specific event will be recorded on the eCRF.  
5.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
5.1 Cyclophosphamide  
Indications: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent indicat ed for treatment of 
malignant diseases including malignant lymphomas, Hodgkin’s disease, lymphocytic lymphoma, mixed- cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, 
Burkitt’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemias, mycosis fungiodes, neuroblastoma, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, retinoblastoma and breast carcinoma.  
 
Mechanism of action : Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that has 
anticancer activity. It is converted in the liver to active alkylating metabolites such as phosphoramide mustard by cytochrome-P450 e nzymes. These alkylating 
metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells. Alkyl radicals intercalate into DNA strands and interfere with DNA replication.  
 
Product description: Cyclophosphamide is supplied as 500 mg, 1 gm and 2 gm 
vials containing white powder for IV administration. Store vials at or below 250C 
(770F). Cyclophosphamide does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and 
care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions. USE ASEPTIC TECHNIQUE.  
 
Solution preparation: Cyclophosphamide should be reconstituted in 25 mL (500 
mg), 50 mL (1 gm) or 100 m L (2 gm) sterile water for injection, USP, for IV 
infusion. Shake vigorously to dissolve the drug. To minimize risk of dermal exposure, always wear gloves when handling vials containing cyclophosphamide sterile powder for injection.

5.2.6 Adverse Events Associated with Pe mbrolizumab  
The most common adverse reactions (reported in ≥20% of patients in clinical trials of pembrolizumab) included fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritus, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea. The following warnings are associated with the use of pembrolizumab:    
 Immune- Mediated Pneumonitis  
Pneumonitis occurred in ~3% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to development of pneumonitis was 5 months with a median duration of 4.9 months.  The one patient with Grade 3 pneumonitis required initial treatment with high -dose systemic corticosteroids (greater than or 
equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis completely resolved in seven of the nine patients with  
Grade 2 -3 pneumonitis. 
 
Immune- Mediated Colitis  
Colitis (including microscopic colitis) occurred 1% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of was 6.5 months with a median duration of 2.6 months. All three patients with Grade 2 or 3 colitis 
were treated with high -dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day).  
Immune- Mediated Hepatitis  
Hepatitis (including autoimmune hepatitis) occurred in 0.5% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The time to onset was 22 days for the case of Grade 4 hepatitis which lasted 1.1 months. The patient with Grade 4 hepatitis permanently discontinued pembrolizumab and was treated with high-dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) systemic corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper. Both patients with hepatitis experienced complete resolution of the event.   
Immune- Mediated Hypophysitis   
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
30 Hypophysitis oc curred in 0.5% of melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of 
pembrolizumab. The time to onset was 1.7 months for the patient with Grade 4 
hypophysitis and 1.3 months for the patient with Grade 2 hypophysitis. Both patients were treated with high -dose (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or 
equivalent per day) corticosteroids followed by a corticosteroid taper and remained on a physiologic replacement dose.   
Renal Failure and Immune- Mediated Nephritis   
Nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) patients of m elanoma patients treated in clinical 
trials of pembrolizumab, consisting of one case of Grade 2 autoimmune nephritis (0.2%) and two cases of interstitial nephritis with renal failure (0.5%), one Grade 3 and one Grade 4. The time to onset of autoimmune nephritis was 11.6 months after the first dose of pembrolizumab (5 months after the last dose) and lasted 3.2 months; this patient did not have a biopsy. Acute interstitial nephritis was confirmed by renal biopsy in two patients with Grades 3- 4 renal failure. All three 
patients fully recovered renal function with treatment with high -dose 
corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper.  
 
Immune- Mediated Hyperthyroidism  
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset was 1.5 months and the median duration was 2.8 months (range 0.9 to 6.1). One of two patients with Grade 2 and the one patient with Grade 3 hyperthy roidism required initial 
treatment with high -dose corticosteroids (greater than or equal to 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day) followed by a corticosteroid taper. One patient (0.2%) required permanent discontinuation of pembrolizumab due to hyperthyroidism. All five patients with hyperthyroidism experienced complete resolution of the event.  
Immune-Mediated Hypothyroidism  
Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 melanoma patients treated in clinical trials of pembrolizumab. The median time to onset of hypothyroidism was 3.5 months. All but two of the patients with hypothyroidism were treated with long- term thyroid  hormone replacement therapy. The other two patients only 
required short- term thyroid hormone replacement therapy. No patient re ceived 
corticosteroids or discontinued pembrolizumab for management of hypothyroidism. Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment.  
 
Other Immune -Mediated Adverse Reactions  
Other clinically important immune -mediated adverse reactions can occu r. The 
following clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions occurred in 
less than 1% of patients treated with pembrolizumab, including exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, partial seizures ari sing in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma, and  
adrenal insufficiency.

February 22, 2022  
    
31  
Across clinical studies with pembrolizumab in approximately 2000 patients, the following additional clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions 
were rep orted in less than 1% of patients: myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, 
and rhabdomyolysis.  
Embryofetal Toxicity  
Based on its mechanism of action, pembrolizumab may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal models link the PD-1/PD- L1 
signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue.  
 
5.2.7 Contraindications 
There are no reported contraindications associated with the use of 
pembrolizumab.  Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on  a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is 
not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.    
5.2.8 Contraception  
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for 120 days after the last dose of study drug by complying with one of the following:   
(1) practice abstinence
† from heterosexual activity;  
OR 
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.   
 Acceptable methods of contraception are
‡: 
 Single method (one of the following is acceptable): • intrauterine device (IUD)  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin   Combination method (requires use of two of the following): • diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   • contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  • male condom or female condom (cannot be used together) • hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill (estrogen/progestin pill or progestin-only pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive injection

PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
32   
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred  and usual 
lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and ERCs/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto- thermal, 
post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.    ‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by local 
regulations/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region. 
 Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of trial therapy.  If there is any question that a subject of childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study. 
 5.2.9 Use in Pregnancy  
If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the patient will immediately be removed from the study.  The site 
will contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to Merck without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life- threatening complication to the mother or 
newborn).  The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male patient impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to Merck and followed as described above and in Section 7.3.3. 
 
5.2.10 Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are breast- feeding are not eligible for 
enrollment.  
 
5.2.11 Overdose  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose w ill be defined as any dose exceeding the 
prescribed dose for pembrolizumab by 20% over the prescribed dose. No specific 
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
33 information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. In the 
event of overdose, pembrolizumab should be discontinued and the patient should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  If a dose of Merck’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” All reports  of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 
24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993- 1220) (see section  7.3.3)

36 Key to Time and Events Table Footnotes  
 
1Radiological assessments, ECHO or MUGA,  and physical exam may be performed up to 4 
weeks prior to day 1 of treatment.  Other evaluations except for pregnancy must be performed 
within 2 week s prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 of treatment. Serum B-HCG must be performed within 72 
hours prior to first dose of study medication for women of child-bearing potential.  Screening labs performed within 72 hours prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 do not need to be repeated on C1D1.  
2 On Study D1 a single priming dose of cyclophosphamide will be given the day before initiating 
treatment  with pembrolizumab on Day 2 of the study. Pembrolizumab cycles are to be repeated 
every 3 weeks ( 21 days) until progression.  A window of +/- 3 days applies to all study visits.  
3The end of treatment visit should be performed 30 days (+/-10 days) after the last dose of study 
medication. Patients who have on ongoing ≥grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) at this visit will continue to be followed until the event is resolved or deemed irreversible by the investigator. 
 The 
first long- term follow- up visit is de fined as 90 days (+/- 15 days) after the last dose of treatment.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs; or follow -up to any SAEs) that occur within 90 days of the end of 
pembrolizumab (or prior to start of new anti- cancer therapy, whichever is earlier) or any grad e of 
Events of Clinical Interest (see section 7.3 and the ECI Guidance Document that is provided as a 
document separate from this protocol) that occur within 90 days of the end of pembrolizumab or 
30 days after the initiation of a new anti- cancer therapy (whichever is earlier) must be 
recorded.  Subsequent follow- up visits, defined as every 60 days thereafter (+/ - 15 days) for up to 
2 years or until death (whichever is first) may be conducted via telephone.  These visits will be 
limited to history of any subsequent cancer treatments, an assessment of any SAE’s considered to be possibly or probably related to study treatment until resolution, and survival status.   
4Perform a c omplete history at baseline only, thereafter focused history on symptoms/toxicity; 
physical exam to include height (baseline only), examination of the skin, weight, and vital signs. 
5Tumor imaging should remain consistent throughout study, and should include contrasted 
computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, bone scan and, if clinically 
indicated, brain MRI. CT Scan from PET scan can also be used instead of contrast CT. The scans should be performed every 9 weeks at the end of  cycles 3, 6, 9, etc., in the first year and every 12 
weeks after one year until progression. EOT scan will not be performed if subject cannot 
withstand scan due to clinical deterioration, or if progression can be determined clinically (i.e. 
worsening of c hest wall lesion).  
6Serum B -HCG must be performed within 72 hours prior to first dose of study medication for 
women of child-bearing potential.  
 7Hematology: CBC with differential, Hgb, and platelet count; Liver function tests : total bilirubin, 
AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT). Serum chemistry : potassium, sodium, calcium, creatinine, 
magnesium, phosphorus, BUN, albumin, and total protein.  
8Thyroid panel includes TSH, T3 and free T4.  If consistent with institutional standard of care, it 
is acceptable to obtain TSH alone and only obtain T3 and free T4 if clinically useful. This test 
should be performed at screening and then every 6 weeks during pembrolizumab therapy (D1 of 
odd numbered cycles of pembrolizumab) and at the end of treatme nt visit.

Patient entering the study while receiving anti-coagulation therapy or those who have the 
initiation of an anti-coagulation therapy should have their coagulation test performed per the 
investigator’s discretion . 
10Fixed paraffin-embedded blocks or slides from the original diagnostic specimen or from a 
recurrence must be requested for patients at baseline.  We will collect fresh biopsies (optional) in  
consenting patients for correlative studies at baseline (predose) and end of treatment (post dose) .

tubes required at each scheduled draw (Required) 
Optional tumor biopsy: Collect a fresh post dose biopsy in consenting subjects for 
correlative studies.  
 
6.4.2 Long-term follow up (90 days after last dose of pembrol izumab)  
Clinical evaluation:  focused history on symptoms/toxicity. Physical exam to 
include weight, examination of skin, and vital signs 
Toxicity: Per NCI CTCAEv4 ; Serious adverse events (SAEs; or follow-up to any 
SAEs) that occur within 90 days of the end of pembrolizumab (or prior to start of new anti -cancer therapy, whichever is earlier) or any grade of Events of Clinical 
Interest (see section 
7.3 and the ECI Guidance Document that is provided as a 
document separate from this protocol) that occur within 90 days of the end of pembrolizumab or 30 days after the initiation of a new anti -cancer therapy 
(whichever is earlier) must be recorded.     
Survival analysis: 
 Note:  Subsequent follow-up visits to occur every 60 days (+/- 15 days) for up to 2 
years or until death (whichever is first) may be conducted via telephone, and wil l 
be limited to history of any subsequent cancer treatments, an assessment of any SAE’s considered to be possibly or probably related to study treatment until resolution, and survival status.   
6.5 Correlative Studies Procedures  
These are described in more det ail in the study procedures laboratory manual.  
6.5.1 Archival Tissue  
Archival tumor tissue (paraffin -embedded blocks/slides) from the patient’s 
original diagnostic biopsy will be requested and collected from all enrolled patients.  See accompanying laboratory m anual for additional details , including 
details on shipping and storage.  
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
42 6.5.2 Fresh Biopsy (optional) 
All patients will also be asked if a fresh biopsy is possible prior to initiation of 
therapy  and at the end of treatment  but these biopsies are not required (this is 
optional). See accompanying laboratory manual for additional details, including details on shipping and storage.  
6.5.3 Blood samples  
Patients will have a three ACD tubes (whole blood, 3 x 8mL) collected at the times as noted in the Time a nd Event table (sample should be collected predose). 
Sample collection, storage, and shipment instructions for serum samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
6.6 Assessment of Safety  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity.  Each patient will be assessed periodically for the development of any toxicity according to the Time and Events table (section 6.0).  Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v4. Toxicities will be characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to 
trial treatment.  
 For subjects receiving treatment with pembrolizumab all adverse events (AEs) of unknown etiology associated with pembrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to determine if it is an Event of Clinical Importance (ECI) with a potential 
immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse events, or irAEs); see the 
separate ECI guidance document (provided as a document separate from this protocol) regarding the identification, evaluation and management of potential irAEs.   
 Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it is considered to be drug related by the investigator.  Please refer to section 7.0 for detailed information reg arding the assessment of 
toxicity and recording of AEs.   
6.7 Assessment of Efficacy  
Subjects who have received at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab will be evaluable for assessment of response and progression.  Progression can be documented: (1) according to RECI ST 1.1 criteria per tumor imaging; (2) as Clinical deterioration; 
or (3) Clinical Progression. Subjects whose cancer growth is documented by physical examination without imaging confirmation will count as progression (i.e. worsening of chest wall lesions) .  Patients who drop out of the study for any 
reason (eg. toxicity of treatment, decide to withdraw) will still be followed for PFS and OS.

43 6.7.1 Assessment of Disease -Tumor Measurement Based on RECIST 1.1 
Disease assessment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria will include imaging and 
physical examination. Refer to  the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) Committee, version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228-247) for additional 
details on RECIST 1.1. To ensure comparability between baseline and subsequent disease assessments, the same method(s) of assessmen t (eg, CT scan, MRI, etc) 
will be used throughout the study for determining response. Tumor assessment will be completed as outlined in the Time and Events table in section 6.1. 
6.7.2 Baseline Documentation of Target and Non- Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.   
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
 A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression”.   
6.7.3 Evaluation of Target Lesions using RECIST 1.1 Criteria  
NOTE:  In addition to the information below, also see section 4.3.2 in the 
international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee, version 1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228- 247) for 
special notes on the assessment of target lesions.  
 
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all targ et lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph node (LN) (whether target or non- target)  must have decreased in short axis 
to <10mm. 
 
Partial response (PR) −At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter 
LD of the target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD )−At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of the 
target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
44 treatment started including baseline if that is the smallest on study.  In addition to 
the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.  The appearance of one or more new lesions also constitutes PD.  
  Note: Any progressive disease as defined by RECIST1.1 in patients that are 
asymptomatic  without signs or symptoms of impending visceral crisis SHOULD 
be confirmed by a repeat scan to rule out "tumor flare".  In these patients and per 
MD discretion, pembrolizumab therapy should be continued in these patients until the repeat scan  is performed ≥ 4 weeks and no more than 6 weeks from the  time 
the initial scan indicated  PD. If PD is confirmed, patients will be withdrawn from 
study. If tumor flare confirmed, patients may continue therapy as per protocol. Subjects that have clear progressive disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 should be 
withdrawn from treatment and a repeat scan is not necessary . 
 
Stable disease (SD)−Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.  
6.7.4 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions using RECIST  1.1 Criteria  
Complete response (CR)− Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker levels.  All LN must be non -pathological in size 
(<10mm short axis).   
 
Non-complete response (non-CR)/non-progression (non- PD)−Persistence of one 
or more non- target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
 
Progressive disease (PD) −Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  
 Note: Any progressive disease as defined by RECIST1.1 in patients that are 
asymptomatic without signs or symptoms of impending visceral crisis SHOULD be confirmed by repeat scan  to rule out "tumor flare". In these patients and per 
MD discretion, pembrolizumab therapy should be continued in these patients until the repeat scan  is performed ≥ 4 weeks but no more than 6 weeks later. If PD is 
confirmed, patients will be withdrawn from study. If tumor flare confirmed, patients may continue therapy as per protocol. Subjects that have clear 
progressive disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 should be withdrawn from treatment and a repeat scan is not necessary.  
 
6.7.5 Other Efficacy Parameters  
6.7.5.1 Evaluation of Response by irRECIST  
An exploratory objective of this study involves assessment of ORR, DCR , PFS 
and DOR based in immune response criteria as outlined  below (see Guidelines for

response criteria.  Wolchok JD et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15(23):7412-20, 
Nishino et al. Clin Cancer Res 19(14):3936-43, and Bohnsack O. et al., 
Adaptation of the immune related response criteria: irRECIST. Annals of Oncology (2014) 25 (suppl_4): iv361-iv372. 10.1093/annonc/mdu342, 2014).  
 irRECIST criteria are based on irRC criteria (Wolchok et al) adapted for unidimensional measurement as outlined by Nishino et al. The adaptation described by Bohnsack et al. further aligns irRECIST to allow for assessment of baseline non- target lesions an d new non-measurable lesions, and discusses the 
impact of those lesions on the overall tumor response assessment. The adaptation by Bohnsack et al. allows for evaluation of patients with non- target disease only 
and patients in the adjuvant setting (not applicable for this study in subjects with metastatic disease).  
  Overall response using the irRECIST  is based on tumor burden as follows: 
 
irCR  Complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or 
not, and no new lesions) Lymph nodes must decrease to < 10 
mm in short axis. Confirmation of response is not mandatory.  
irPR Decrease in tumor burden ≥30% in TMTB relative to baseline 
confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks after first documentation, non-target lesions are irNN, and no equivocal progression of new non- measurable lesions.  
irSD  Not meeting criteria for irCR, irPR, in absence of irPD  
irPD  Increase in tumor burden ≥20% increase and minimum 5 mm 
absolute increase in TMTB compared to nadir, or irPD for non-target or new non- measurable lesions confirmed by a repeat, 
consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first 
documented  
irNN  No target disease was identified at baseline and at follow -up the 
patient fails to meet criteria for irCR or irPD.  
  irNN = irNon -CR/Non -PD 
TMTB = Total measureable tumor burden

46 7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Definition s  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by the investigator to the study therapy.  Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of Merck product in clinical trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event.   
All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
allocation/randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol- specified 
interventio n, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. 
From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through 30 days following 
cessation of treatment, all adverse events must be reported b y the investigator. 
Such events will be recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event case report forms/worksheets.  The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is described in section  7.3.3. The investigator will make every 
attempt to follow all subjects with non -serious adverse events for outcome.  
Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during the pre-screening period (for determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any protocol-specified procedure or intervention.  If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to the main study and AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.

PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
47 7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A 
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a  medical judgment made in consideration 
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other 
factors to consider in cons idering drug as the cause of the AE:  
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) 
• One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with dru g 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event .   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that 
indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group 
than in a concurrent or historical control group 
7.1.3 Unexpected AE  or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if the specificity or severity of it is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  U nexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.   
7.1.4 Serious AE  or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization (>24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospitalization;*  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
48 • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.  
 *Hospitalization for anticipated or protocol specified procedures such as administration of chemotherapy, central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE.  
• 
Note:  In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the 
below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the 
Merck in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are cons idered serious by Merck for collection 
purposes. 
o Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); 
o Is associated with an overdose. 
  
7.2 Document ation of non- serious AEs or SARs  
For non-serious AEs or SARs, documentation must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow- up period after treatment is 
discontinued.   
 
Collected information should be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRF) for 
that patient.  Please include a description of the event, its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study 
drug. Documentation should occur at least monthly.  
7.3 SAE s, Serious SAR s or Events of Clinical Interest   
7.3.1 Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout ).  
 For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a 
serious SAR, recording of the event  must begin from day 1 of study treatment and 
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
49 continue through the 90 day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued (or 
to the initiation of new anti- cancer treatment, whichever is earliest).  
7.3.2 Documentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs or Serious SARs) must be recorded in the SAE console 
within Oncore™ for that patient within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  
For Affiliate sites, an email must also be sent to the NCCN Project Manager  
indicating that an SAE or Serio us SAR has been entered into Oncore (email 
contact will be provided at study start-up).  
7.3.3 Reporting  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
UNC : 
• UNC will submit an aggregated list of all SAEs to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and 
procedures. 
The UNC -IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an Unanticipated 
Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web -based reporting 
system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
Affiliate sites:   
• For affiliate sites using a local IRB of record, please submit adverse events per local IRB policy. 
• For affiliate sites relying on the UNC -IRB, an aggregated list of all SAEs 
will be submitted to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and procedures. In addition, any SAEs that qualify as an Unanticipated Problem will be entered into Oncore and reported to the UNC IRB by the UNCCN Project Manager  using the IRB’s 
web-based reporting system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 days of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
Pregnancy  
It is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them), includi ng the pregnancy 
of a male subject's female partner that occurs during the trial or within 120 days of completing the trial completing the trial, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, as a 
serious adverse event.  The patient is to be discontinued immediately from any 
protocol directed therapy. All subjects and female partners of male subjects who become pregnant must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious adverse events (Important medical events) .  
If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be 
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
50 reported. Such events must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 
2 days to the manufacturer (; see 7.3.3.1 Merck report requirements ). 
 Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.   
Pregnancies and lactations that occur from the time of treatment through 120 days following cessation of study medication, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported by the investigator.    For Affiliate sites, the pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to the UNCCN Project Manager within 24 hours via facsimile to 919-966-4300.  The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
 
 FDA Expedited Reporting requiremen ts: 
If an investigator deems that an event is both a serious SAR AND unexpected, it 
must also (in addition to Oncore) be recorded on the MedWatch Form 3500A as per 21 CFR 312.32.  For Affiliate Investigators, the MedWatch form should be faxed to the UNCCN Project Manager at 919-966-4300 along with supporting 
documentation defining the event and causality.  The MedWatch 3500a form can be accessed at: http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/HowToReport/DownloadForms/default.htm
. 
(Please be sure and access form 3500a, and not form 3500).   UNC, as the Sponsor of the study, will make the final determination regarding FDA submission.   
 Once the UNC Principal Investigator determin es an event is a serious SAR AND 
unexpected, the MedWatch 3500A form will be submitted to the FDA by the UNCCN Project Manager.  If the event is serious, unexpected and considered to be possibly-, probably- or definitely -related to the study treatment, the  UCCN Project 
Manager will inform the Regulatory Associate at UNC who will be responsible for submitting the SAR to the IND. All IND safety reports must be submitted on Form 3500A and be accompanied by Form 1571. The FDA must be notified or any unexpected or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions as soon as possible, but 
no later than 7 calendar days of learning of the event. 
 
The UNCCN Project Manager will also be responsible for informing each Affiliate  
site of all serious and unexpected SARs report ed to the FDA via fax as soon as 
possible.

Any SAE, or follow up to a SAE, including death due to any cause other than 
progression of the cancer under study that occurs to any subject from the time the consent is signed through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or the initiation of new anti- cancer therapy, whichever is earlier, whether or not related 
to Merck product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to Merck Global Safety. All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome.  Non-serious Events of Clinical Interest will be forwarded to Merck Global Safety 
and will be handled in the same manner as SAEs.  
 Additionally, any serious adverse event, considered b y an investigator who is a 
qualified physician to be related to Merck product that is brought to the attention of the investigator at any time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph also must be reported immediately to the Sponsor and to Merck. 
 
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to the Merck Global Safety facsimile number:  +1 -215-993-1220  
 All 15 -Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports must be submitted as required

Events of clinical interest for this trial include : 
1.  an overdose of Merck product, as defined below under overdose.  2.  an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at t he same time, an alkaline 
phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol- specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.*  
*Note:  These criteria are based upon available regulatory gui dance documents. 
The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  
 
Overdose 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as an y 
dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a Merck product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
 If a dose of Merck’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is report ed as a non -serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the 
terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to Merck Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993-1220)

53 Specifically, the suspected/actual events covere d in this exception include any 
event that is disease progression of the cancer under study. 
The Sponsor will monitor aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to 
ensure the safety of the subjects in the trial. Any suspected endpoint which upon review is not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Merck Global Safety as a SAE within 2 working days of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under study. 
Hospitalization related to convenience (e.g.transportation issues etc.) will not be 
considered a SAE.  
 
7.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The Principal  Investigator will provide continuous monitoring of patient safety in 
this trial with periodic reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring C ommittee 
(DSM C).  
 Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual, 
and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  These meetings will include the investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical research associates, regulatory associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any other relevant personnel the principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research team will discuss  all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, 
safety, regulatory, data collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by any of the regulatory bodies charged with the safety of human subjects and the integrity of data including, but not limited to, the oversight ( Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) 
Biomedical  IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North 
Carolina TraCS Institute Data and  Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).   
 
The UNC LCCC Data and Safety  Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the 
study on a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review based on risk and complexity as determined by the UNC Protocol Review Committee .  The UNC PI will be responsible for submitting the following 
information for review: 1) safety and accrual data including the number of 
patients treated; 2) significant developments reported in the literature that may affect the safety of participants or the ethics of the study; 3) preliminary response 
data; and 4) summaries of team meetings that have occurred since the last report.  
Findings of the DSMC review will be disseminated by memo to the UNC PI, PRC, and the UNC IRB  and DSMB.   
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
LCCC 1525   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: Dees   UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA  
February 22, 2022  
    
54 8.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, phase 2 trial of single-dose 
cyclophosphamide +pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The primary hypothesis being evaluated is that the addition of one dose of cyclophosphamide prior to initiation of pembrolizumab will result in an approximately 50% improvement in progression free survival 
(PFS) when compared to historical controls that were treated with pembrolizumab alone  [1].  A biologically -focused primary objective is to describe the reduction in 
Tregs in patients with metastatic TNBC receiving cyclopho sphamide + 
pembrolizumab.  Secondary endpoints include the ORR, DCR , DOR, and OS. The tolerability and 
safety of single-dose cyclophosphamide + pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic TNBC will also be assessed (See section 2.4.2. for end point 
definitions and Section 8.3).  
 Correlative studies, based on serial blood collections and tumor samples, will be done under a separate protocol based on availability of archival di agnostic tissue 
(see section 1.4). 
8.2 Sample Size and Accrual  
The primary objective of this study is to estimate PFS defined as time from D1 of treatment until disease progression or death from any cause. Based on recent 
phase 1 data with pembrolizumab alone, we set the null hypothesis for median 
PFS at 1.9 months. T he alternative hypothesis is a median PFS of 2.9 months for 
patients who receive a single dose cyclophosphamide prior to pembrolizumab. This approximately 50% increase in PFS would be considered clinically significant.  
 Assuming that accrual occurs within a 12 month period, and all patients are 
followed for at least 6 months, 36 patients are needed to detect the change in median PFS from 1.9 to 2.9 months. This sample size calculation is based on a 
one-sided 0.05 significance level, 80% power, and assuming an exponential survival time distribution (calculated using SWOG online One Arm Survival calculator  at https://www.swogstat.org/stat/public/one survival.html
).  We will 
also assume a 10 % consent and not treat or loss to follow- up rate. Therefore we 
plan to enroll 40 patients to ensure that 36 are evaluable for the primary endpoint.  We expect accrual to take approximately 2 years   , with the rate of accrual being 1 
to 2  patients per month. 
 While this study is not specifically powered for the assessment of Treg reduction, with the projected evaluable sample size, we will be able to detect an approximate reduction in Tregs of 67% (i.e.a3-fold reduction) using the Wilcoxon sign-rank test, with 80% power and a one- sided alpha=0.05.

55 8.3 Toxicity Monitoring  
Toxicity will be assessed using NCI CTCAE version 4. Patients will be monitored for 
excessive toxicity over the duration of the study. A toxicity rate due to the study 
regimen greater than 25% would be considered unacceptable.   
 
Pocock-type boundaries will be utilized as described in Ivanova, A., et al.  Biometrics. 
2005;61(2):540-5.  If a toxicity boundary is reached, accrual for the study will be suspended and the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be alerted. 
The DSMC (in consultation with the Principal Investigator and MERCK) will 
evaluate the toxicity events to help determine whether or not to terminate the study. 
 
Accrual to the trial is to be suspended if the number of protocol defined toxic events is equal to or larger than boundary in the table below.  
Number of Patients  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

8.4 Data Analysi s Plans  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the primary objective. The primary objective of this study is to estimate PFS defined as time from D1 of treatment 
until documented disease progression or death from any cause. The Kaplan- Meier 
method will be used to estimate PFS and median PFS will be reported along with its 95% confidence interval.  Also of primary interest is quantifying the exp ected reduction in Tregs. While this 
is listed as a co -primary objective, statistically it will be treated as an exploratory 
objective.  With the projected sample size, we will be able to detect a reduction in Tregs of 67% (ie, 3 -fold reduction) using the Wilcoxon sign- rank test. We will 
report appropriate descriptive statistics to quantitate the number and function of Tregs in these patients.  
 Secondary objectives include estimating the ORR, DCR , DOR, OS, and 
characterizing the toxicity profile and safety of this regimen.  ORR and DCR  will 
be reported along with their corresponding exact two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate DOR and OS. 
Median DOR an d OS will be reported along with their 95% confidence intervals.  
 The analysis of the toxicity and safety of this regimen will be based on the frequency of adverse events and their severity for patients who received any study medicine. Worst toxicity grad es per patient will be tabulated for adverse events 
and laboratory measurements by using the NCI CTCAEv4 and will be reported in the form of frequency tables.

56 Demographic and baseline laboratory results will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  
 
Definitions  
• Progression Free Survival (PFS): A patient’s progression- free survival will be 
defined as the time from D1 of treatment until the date he or she has 
documented disease progression or dies. Any patient who has received study treatment but has neither experienced progression nor died will be censored on the date of his or her last tumor assessment  
• Overall Survival (OS): A patient’s survival time will be defined as the time 
from start of treatment to the date of his or her death. If the patient has not 
died, survival will be censored on last date the patient was known to be alive  
• Overall Response Rate (ORR): The overall response rate will be defined as the total number of patients whose response are either a CR or PR divided by the number of response evaluable patients  
• Disease Control Rate (DCR): Clinical benefit will be defined as the total 
number of patients whose responses are either a CR, PR, or SD divided by the number of response evaluable patients. Patients will need to be at least a SD for at least 6 months in order to be considered to have received clinical benefit 
from the treatment regime n 
• Duration of Overall Response (DOR): The duration of overall response will be computed for patients whose best response is either PR or CR. It will be measured from when the time measurement criteria are first met for complete 
response or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date of progressive disease or death. Patients who neither progress nor die will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment  
 Exploratory objectives will be evaluated when sample sizes are such to allow appropriate analyses. To explore possible associations of biological markers with ORR, logistic regression modeling will be used. To explore possible associations
 
of biological markers with PFS and OS, Cox regression modeling will be used. Fisher’s exact tests will be used to test for differences in ORR and DCR  between 
subtypes of TNBC.  For each T cell phenotype, the change in percentage of T cells will be calculated at the patient level, and descriptive statistics will be reported.  TCR and BCR repertoire profiles will be characterized as having high or low sequence ‘diversity’, and the possible association of these dichotomized variables will be explored by Fisher’s exact test with ORR, and Cox regression modeling with PFS and OS. The same statistical methods (outlined above) will used for outcomes defined using the irRECIST  criteria.

11.4 Appendix D Patient Handout: Prohibited Medications  
 
One of the medications you are receiving during this clinical trial is  
cyclophosphamide.  Cyclophosphamide interacts with some drugs that are processed by your liver. Because of this, it is very important to tell your study 
doctors about all of your medicine before you start this study. It is also very 
important to tell them if you stop taking any regular medicine, or if you start 
taking a new medicine while you take part in this study. When you talk about your medicine with your study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug store (over-the counter remedy), or anything that you buy from the health food store or grocery store (herbal supplement). Many health care prescribers can write prescriptions. You must also tell your other prescribers (doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitioners) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. Bring this paper  with you .  
 
• Cyclophosphamide is processed by a certain enzyme in the liver called 
CYP 450 enzymes.  Drugs that increase the activity of this enzyme are 
called “inducers”, and drugs that decrease the activity of this enzyme are called “inhibitors”.  Cyclophosphamide must be used very carefully with other medicines that are inducers  or inhibitors  of CY P450.   
• You and healthcare providers who prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or removing any drug in this category 
• Before you start the study, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber to switch the following medications if you are taking them:  
o Ticlopidine, fluvoxamine, efavirenz, amodiarone, diosmin, fluconazole, miconazole, oxandrolone, ticynafen, amprenavir, atazanvir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, fosamprenavir, grapefruit juice, idinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, telaprevir, troleansomycin, vriconazole, aprepitant, cimetidine, darunavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, imatinib, nifedipine, posaconazole, tofisopam, verapamil, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St  John’s Wort, bosentan, etravirine, nafcillin, nevirapine, and 
phenobarbital 
• Your regular prescribers should look at this web site: http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.asp to see if any medicine they want to prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid.  Your study doctor may also have a list of medications for you to show your regular prescribers instead of, or in addition to, this website.   
• If you drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit, you should avoid these for at least 1 week before r eceiving cyclophosphamide until 3 days after the 
dose.   
• Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs.

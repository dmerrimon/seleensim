1.1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  AND/OR SCHEMA  
 
Primary  Objective  This is a phase  II study  to assess  the efficacy  of short  course  
daratumumab in  multiple  myeloma  patients  with minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  positivity  
after induction  therapy  with/without  consolidative  autologous  stem  cell transplant  (ASCT).  
Primary  objective  of the study  will be to  determine  the rate of MRD  negativity  by the 
completion  of 6 months  of daratumumab  therapy.  
 
Secondary  Objectives : 
 
1. To assess  the rate of sustained  MRD  negativity  in the bone  marrow.  
2. To determine duration  of MRD  negativity  
3. To compare  MRD  techniques  of multi-parametric  flow cytometry  with next-generation  
sequencing  and mass  spectrometry.  
4. To determine progression -free and  overall survival  
 
 
Exploratory  Studies:  
 
1. The gene  panel  MyType  (or comparable  next generation  sequencing  panel)  will 
explore  whether  any mutations  appear  to be associated  with response  to therapy  or 
toxicity  associated  with therapy.  
 
2. MyType(or  comparable  next generation sequencing  panel)   will also be evaluated  
using  samples  at the time of progression  of disease and  will be compared  to the pre- 
treatment  baseline samples  to explore  whether  pathways  leading  to emergence  of 
resistance  to the drug regimen  can be identified.  
 
Patient  Population    
 
The proposed  study  will enroll  newly  diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  patients  achieving  a 
very good  partial  response  (VGPR)  or better  with MRD positivity  by flow cytometry  after 
induction therapy  with/without  ASCT  as well patients  previously  MRD  negative for at least 
3 months  (after  induction  and consolidation  therapy)  and have  turned  MRD  positive  by 
flow cytometry  with no evidence  of progressive  disease.  All patients  must  be on standard  
of care lenalidomide  maintenance  for at least 6 months  at the time of enrollment.  
 
Study  Design  
 
• Single arm  phase  II trial of daratumumab  for MRD  positive  multiple  myeloma  
patients  currently  receiving  standard of care lenalidomide maintenance  therapy.  
• Daratumumab  is administered weekly  for cycles  1 and 2 and bi-weekly  for the 
remaining  4 cycles..  
• Bone marrow  biopsy  will be obtained  at baseline  for confirmation  of diagnosis  and 
correlative  studies.  A follow -up bone marrow  biopsy  will be performed  at the 
completion  of treatment  or at disease  progression.

• Patients  will also undergo  evaluation  for response at monthly intervals  using  
traditional  IMW uniform  response criteria  (Kumar.  et al.  Lancet  Oncology  2016)  
with serum  and urine  protein electrophoresis,  immunofixation,  and serum free light 
chains (FLC).  
• Patients  will continue standard  of care lenalidomide  maintenance  during  the 
protocol  and after completing daratumumab  as recommended  by the treating  
physician.  
 
Statistics  
 
The primary  objective  of this trial is to determine  whether  treatment  with daratumumab is  
associated  with a substantial  fraction of patients  with MRD  positive multiple  myeloma  
converting  to a MRD  negative state  as assessed  by multicolor  flow cytometry.  Previously  
studies have reported  that approximately  10% of patients  will achieve  deeper  responses  
including  MRD  negativity  after maintenance  therapy  with lenalidomide alone29. The current  
study  will be considered  positive  if the rate of MRD  negativity  is 30%  or higher  with 
daratumumab.  This study  will implement  a Simon’s  two-stage  minimax  design  to 
distinguish between  an unpromising  rate of 10% and a promising  rate of 30%.  The study  is 
designed  to have  a type I error and a type II error of 0.10.  The maximum  sample  size is 25 
patients  
 
 
 
 
Treatment  Plan (see schema  below)  
 
• Cycles  1 and 2: Daratumumab 16mg/kg  weekly  as intravenous  infusion  
(total  duration:  8 weeks)  
• Cycles  3-6: Daratumumab  16mg/kg  once  every  2 weeks  as intravenous  
infusion  (total  duration:  16 weeks)  
• Lenalidomide  maintenance  therapy  to be administered  as standard  treatment  to 
all patients.  This is administered  as 5-15 mg daily 21-28/28 day cycle.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Introduction  
 
 
Multiple  Myeloma  and daratumumab  
 
Multiple  myeloma is characterized  by clonal  proliferation  of malignant  plasma  cells in the 
bone  marrow,  affecting  an estimated 22,000  people  in the US annually  1; about  75,000  
people  are living  with, or in remission  from,  multiple myeloma.  Disease  hallmarks  include  
presence of monoclonal  protein  in serum  or urine  and features  of end organ  damage,  
including  hypercalcemia,  renal  insufficiency,  anemia,  and bone  lytic lesions  2.  Multiple  
myeloma remains  incurable  with an estimated  median  survival  of 3-4 years  with 
conventional  therapies and longer with newer  agents  3,4. 
CD38  is a 45-kD, type II transmembrane  glycoprotein  that associates  with cell-surface  
receptors  in lipid rafts,  regulates  cytoplasmic  Ca2+ flux, and mediates  signal transduction  in 
lymphoid  and myeloid cells5,6. CD38 is highly  and uniformly  expressed  on myeloma  cells7,8 
and is expressed  at relatively  low levels  on normal  lymphoid and myeloid cells and in some  
tissues of nonhematopoietic  origin,  which  makes  it a potential  target  in the treatment  
of myeloma6. Daratumumab  (HuMax -CD38,  Genmab),  a human  IgG1κ  monoclonal  
antibody,  binds  to a unique CD38 epitope9. Preclinical  studies  showed that  daratumumab  
induced target -cell killing of  CD38 -expressing tumor  cells by means  of multiple  
mechanisms,  including  complement -mediated  and antibody -dependent  cell-mediated  
cytotoxic  effects,  antibody -dependent  cellular phagocytosis,  apoptosis9,10, and to a lesser  
extent,  inhibition  of the enzymatic  activity  of CD38.  
 
Early  phase clinical  trials have established  the single  agent  activity  and efficacy  of this 
drug in patients with relapsed  and/or  refractory  myeloma  patients11. Furthermore,  the drug 
is fairly  well tolerated  with infusion  related  reactions  being  the most  common adverse  
events11. Daratumumab  was approved by the FDA as monotherapy  for patients  with 
relapsed/refractory  multiple  myeloma  in November  2015.  This approval  was based  on a 
single arm  phase  trial with 106 patients  that demonstrated  an objective  response  rate of 
29% with median duration  of response of 7.4 months.  
 
Daratumumab  in Combination  with Lenalidomide  and Dexamethasone  
 
More recently,  Dimopoulos  et al published  the results  of a Phase  3 study  in patients  with 
multiple  myeloma  with one or more prior  lines of therapy  randomized to receive  
lenalidomide  (Revlimid®) and dexamethasone either  alone  or in combination  with 
daratumumab12. The estimated  12 month progression -free survival  was 83.2% of patients  
receiving  the three  drug combination  compared  to 60.1%  amongst  patients  receiving  
lenalidomide  and dexamethasone  only12. Daratumumab  was approved  by the FDA in 
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone  for patients  with relapsed/refractory  
multiple  myeloma  in November  2016.  However,  daratumumab  is not currently  approved  by 
the FDA for the indication  under  the current  study  i.e. patients  with MRD  positivity  after 
induction therapy  with/without  consolidative  HDT/ASCT.

Minimal  Residual  Disease  Testing  in Myeloma  
 
In the past decade,  multiple  myeloma  patients  have reached  deeper  response  rates with 
use of effective  anti-myeloma  therapeutics,  immunomodulatory  agents  and proteasome  
inhibitors,  approximating  up to  75% patients  achieving  near-complete  response  (>90%  
decrease in monoclonal  protein)  or complete  response  (100% decrease in  monoclonal  
protein).  In general,  improved therapeutics  and deeper  response  rates  have  resulted  in 
improved overall survival  of multiple  myeloma  patients  across  most  age groups.  As a 
result,  there has been  an increasing  interest  for the development  of sensitive  assays  to 
detect  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  in treated  MM patients13.  In MM patients,  MRD - 
negative  status  using multi -parametric  flow cytometry  (MFC)  is associated  with improved  
progression  free survival  and overall survival14,15.  Similar  studies using  next generation  
sequencing methods  for MRD  have  also been  shown  to be  associated  with improved  
outcomes  in MM MRD -negative  patients.  
 
Minimal  Residual  Disease  Platforms  
 
A recent  survey  including  30 major  institutions  in the US found  major  heterogeneity in 
MRD  testing  of multiple  myeloma  by flow cytometry16. In brief,  there  was considerable  
variation in the number  of bone  marrow  cells analyzed  (events)  and number  of abnormal  
plasma cells  needed  to define  the presence  of MRD,  which  affects  maximum  possible  
sensitivity.  The maximum  detection  sensitivity  ranged  from 0.0005%  to 0.02%,  a 100-fold 
difference in sensitivity.  Also,  the variation in antibodies  studied and definition  of an 
abnormal  plasma  cell by flow cytometry  affected  the ability  to differentiate  normal  from 
neoplastic  plasma  cells.  
 
In 2015,  the Department  of Laboratory  Medicine developed,  validated  and implemented  
the 10-color  flow cytometry  platform  in collaboration  with the Myeloma  Service  and 
the International  Myeloma  Foundation.  The MSK  single  tube 10 -color  flow cytometry  
platform  demonstrates  similar  results  to Euroflow  and is already  in use under  clinical  
practice17 .  Because  there  is currently  no data available  to compare  the sensitivity  of the 
MSK  model  and molecular  MRD  assays,  as a secondary  endpoint,  we will compare  our 
10-color  flow cytometry  platform  against  next generation  sequencing  and mass  
spectrometry.  These  studies  will help us to better  understand  and further  develop  details  
of various MRD  methods.  
 
3.2 Proposed  Study  Investigation  with Correlative  Studies  
 
MRD negativity  after induction  (with/without  consolidative  ASCT) is  an increasingly  important  
outcome  for patients with multiple  myeloma. The management  of low burden disease  (VGPR  or 
better)  after initial  induction  and during maintenance therapy  is unclear  at this time.  In the current  
study,  we propose  short  course  daratumumab  for newly  diagnosed  MM patients  with very good  
partial  response  (VGPR)  or better  after induction  therapy  with/without  consolidative  HDT/ASCT  
and MRD  positive  by bone  marrow  flow cytometry  and for patients  who were  previously  MRD  
negative  after induction  and consolidation  and recently  (within  last 3 months)  turned  MRD  positive  
(with no evidence of clinical  progression)  by bone  marrow  flow cytometry.  All patients  must  be on 
standard of care lenalidomide maintenance  for at least 6 months at  the time of enrollment

All patients  will receive a total of 24 weeks of daratumumab  therapy  (16 mg/kg intravenous  
infusion  weekly  for 8 weeks  followed by every  2 weeks  for 16 weeks)  and continue  standard  of 
care lenalidomide  maintenance  therapy.  Baseline  studies will include  bone  marrow  biopsy  and 
aspirates with the first pulled  bone  marrow  sample sent for multi-parametric  flow cytometry  as a 
priority  sample  to determine  MRD  status  and determine  eligibility.  Upon  completion  of protocol  
therapy  or when  patients  achieve  sCR,  patients  will undergo  a repeat  bone  marrow  biopsy  and 
aspirate  for MRD  assessment  and correlative  studies.  
 
The study  is powered  to assess efficacy  (as determined  by rate of MRD  negativity)  of 
daratumumab in combination  with standard  of care lenalidomide  maintenance amongst  patients  
with low burden disease  (i.e. MRD  positivity).  Our study  is novel  since  no prior myeloma  study  
has been  designed  to target  MRD  positive  disease  with the primary  endpoint  of achieving  status  
MRD negativity.   Secondary  endpoints  include evaluation of sustain MRD  negativity,  
progression -free survival,  overall -survival,  and comparison  of MRD  platforms.   Based  on the 
rapidly  evolving field  with new powerful  drugs,  the anticipation is that MRD  will become  a new 
endpoint  for future  myeloma  trials.  MSK  myeloma service  is a global  leader  in this context.  
 
3.3 Federal  Regulations:  The Privacy  Rule  
 
In the case  of research  repositories  of tissue and biological  specimens,  the collection  of such  
samples  is treated as research  under  the Privacy  Standards  (67 Fed Reg 53231;  HIPAA  Privacy  
Rule and Public  Health:  Guidance  from CGC  and HHS).   Under  HIPAA,  all subjects  must  agree  to 
sign research  authorizations that  describe  the uses and disclosures of their protected  health  
information,  as well as informed consents  that describe  the risks and benefits  of participating  in 
the study.  It is not acceptable  to sign one or the other.   Both documents  must be signed  by the 
subject  to be considered  a valid study  participant  (45 CFR 164.508(b)(3)).  
 
The aim of informed  consent  is to educate potential  research  participants  about  the risks and 
benefits  of the study,  how confidentiality  of records  will be protected,  and other elements  outlined  
in 45 CFR 46 and 21 CFR 50 and 56. HIPAA  requires  an authorization  that can be incorporated  
into an informed consent  document  if both the Privacy  Rule and either  the Common  Rule or FDA 
regulation  apply  to the research  study.  If the health  information  is de-identified  under  the privacy  
standards  (eliminating  the 18 elements of PHI),  then the Privacy  Rule does  not apply.  
 
 
3.4 Office of  Human  Research  Protections  Guidance  
 
The Office  of Human  Research  Protections  (OHRP,  1997)  provides  clarification,  guidance,  and 
oversight  for research  subject to the Common  Rule.  Research use of banked tissue  or biological  
material  is specifically  addressed  by an OHRP policy  guideline.  IRB oversight  is recommended  for 
the process  of specimen  acquisition into the repository  as well as for the process  of distributing  
samples  to subsequent  researchers  and their local IRBs.  OHRP suggests informed  consent  
“should be as specific as possible”  and include a “clear  description”  of the following  basic  
elements:  a) the operation  of the cell repository;  b) the specific  types  of research  to be  conducted;  
c) the conditions under  which  data and specimens  will be released  to recipient -investigators;  and 
d) procedures  for protecting  the privacy  of subjects  and maintaining  the confidentiality  of data.

3.5 New York State Law 
Under  HIPAA,  in instances  where  a state law  is more stringent  than the Privacy  Rule,  the state  
law is to be  followed.  In New York State,  genetic  test results  (those  that contain  genetic  
information on inherited  risk of disease)  are confidential  and cannot  be disclosed  to anyone  
without  the written  informed  consent  of the individual to whom  the genetic  test result  relates  (New  
York State  Civil Rights Law §79-1(3)(a)).  Genetic  testing  is defined by this law as: 
 
any laboratory  test of human  DNA, chromosomes,  genes,  or gene  products  to 
diagnose the presence  of a genetic  variation  linked  to a predisposition  to a genetic  
disease  or disability  in the individual  or the individual’s  offspring;  such  term shall 
also include DNA  profile  analysis … 
 
According  to §79-1(4)(a),  anonymous  samples  may be genetically  tested  for Institutional  Review  
Board  (IRB) -approved  research  in which  the anonymity  of the samples  is assured.  For research  
genetic  testing  using human  tissue stored in repositories,  a general  waiver  of informed  consent  
may be obtained  (§79-1(2)(c))  if the individuals  who supplied the samples  “have  given  prior 
written  informed  consent  for the use of their sample  for general  research purposes  and did not 
specify  time limits  or other  factors  that would  restrict  use of the sample”  (§79-1(9)(a)).  The 
samples  must  be either  permanently  de-identified  or coded such  that the researcher  performing  
the genetic  test is unable  to re-identify  the specimens.  
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a single arm  phase  II study  to investigate  the efficacy  of short  course  daratumuab  for

better  after induction therapy  with/without  consolidative  HDT/ASCT  and MRD  positive  by bone  
marrow  flow cytometry  and MM patients  who were  previously  MRD  negative  after induction  and 
consolidation and recently  (within  last 3 months)  turned  MRD  positive  by bone  marrow  flow 
cytometry  will be enrolled.

5.1 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
5.2 Daratumumab  
 
DARZALEX™ (daratumumab)  is a human  immunoglobulin  G1 kappa  (IgG1ĸ)  monoclonal  
antibody  (mAb)  that binds  with high affinity  to a unique  epitope  on CD38,  a transmembrane  
glycoprotein.  It is a targeted  immunotherapy  directed  towards  tumor  cells that express  high 
levels  of CD38,  in a variety  of hematological  malignancies  including  MM, leukemia,  and non- 
Hodgkin’s  lymphoma (NHL).  
 
Daratumumab  induces  lysis of CD38 -expressing  tumor  cells,  by a wide spectrum  of mechanisms  
including  complement -dependent  cytotoxicity  (CDC),  antibody -dependent  cell-mediated  
cytotoxicity  (ADCC),  and antibody -dependent  cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP),  through  activation  of 
complement  proteins,  natural  killer (NK) cells,  and macrophages,  respectively9,10. For the 
most  comprehensive  nonclinical  and clinical  information  as well as Reference  Safety  
Information  regarding  daratumumab,  refer to the latest  version  of the Investigator's  Brochure  
[Daratumumab  IB]. 
 
Preliminary  pharmacodynamic  studies  suggest  that daratumumab  utilizes  multiple  effector  cell 
functions,  resulting  in immune  mediated  killing  of CD38 -expressing  tumor  cells.  In ex vivo 
experiments  utilizing  human  bone  marrow  stromal  cells co-cultured  with primary  CD38 - 
expressing  MM cells,  complement -dependent  cytotoxicity(CDC)  occurs   rapidly   and 
demonstrates  maximal  myeloma  cell killing  by daratumumab  within  1 hour of antibody - mediated  
activation  of the complement  proteins9  . Daratumumab -induced  antibody - dependent  cell- 
mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC)  is slower  in its action,  with maximal  ADCC  by 
daratumumab  observed  at 4 hours  in vitro (de Weers  2011)2 . Daratumumab  has also been  
 
shown  to  induce  antibody -dependent  cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP)  in the presence  of 
macrophages  within  4 hours  in vitro (Overdijk  2013)10. Further,  in vitro studies  indicated  that 
daratumumab  inhibited  the cyclase  activity  of CD38  and stimulated  the CD38  hydrolase  activity  
(Study  No. GMB  3003 -013).  Daratumumab  induces  the elimination  of CD38+  populations  of 
Tregs,  Bregs  and MDSCs  and is hypothesized  to support  the clonal  expansion  of effector  T 
cells.  
 
Studies  on proliferation  of and release  of cytokines  in human  blood  cells have  indicated  that 
daratumumab  does  not exert  target -specific  agonistic  activity.  The cytokine  release  observed  
is mainly  caused  by the Fc-portion  of IgG1  and comparable  to that of approved  therapeutic  
antibodies  already  in clinical  use. Specific  binding  of daratumumab  was detected  in multiple  
tissues  of both human  and chimpanzee  origin.  
 
 
In general,  daratumumab  is tolerated  well. Maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  has not been  
reached  following  intravenous  (IV) infusions  up to 24 mg/kg  monotherapy  and 16 mg/kg  in 
combination  studies.  The most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  (AEs)  across  the 
daratumumab  program  have  been  infusion -related  reactions  (IRRs)  following  single  agent  
therapy.  Among  all subjects  treated  in ongoing  studies  (monotherapy  and combination  therapy),  
IRRs  have  been  reported  in 49% of subjects;  among  151 subj ects treated  with 
16 mg/kg  daratumumab  monotherapy in  Studies  GEN501  and MMY2002,  the percentage

of subjects  with  a  reported   IRR  was  identical   (49%)   to  what  was  observed   across   all 
treated   subjects.   The  most  frequently   reported  AEs (reported  in ≥5% of subjects)  reported  
as IRRs  were  rhinitis  allergic  (8%),  cough  (7%),  and nasal  congestion  (6%).  Among  subjects  
treated  with 16 mg/kg  daratumumab  monotherapy,  the most  commonly  reported  IRRs  were  
nasal  congestion  (8%),  cough  (7%),  and rhinitis  allergic  and throat  irritation  (5% each).  Grade  
3 or higher  IRRs  were  reported  in 5% of subjects  treated  with 16 mg/kg  daratumumab   as 
monotherapy,  with bronchospasm  and hypertension  being  the most  frequently  reported  Grade  
3 or higher IRRs  (1% each).  
 
Across  all ongoing  studies,  bronchospasm  was reported  in 10 subjects.  Early  in daratumumab  
development,  in Study  GEN501,  2 cases  of bronchospasm  were  reported  24- 48 hours  
following  the second  full-dose  infusion  of daratumumab.  With the exception  of those  
2 cases,  which had a delayed  onset,  all other  reported  bronchospasm  events  occurred  following  
the first dose.  All of the events  occurring  during  the infusion  period  resolved  quickly  after 
standard  treatments  were  administered.  The daratumumab  infusion  was restarted,   and  no 
new onset  of bronchospasm  occurred.  Most  of the subjects  who experienced  bronchospasm  
had underlying  respiratory  diseases  (asthma,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  [COPD],  
and others).  
 
Among  the 151 subjects  treated  with 16 mg/kg  daratumumab  as monotherapy  in Studies  
GEN501  and MMY2002,  the most  frequently  reported  AEs (reported  in >10%  of subjects)  were  
fatigue  (29%);  anemia  (23%);  nausea  (19%);  back pain (18%);  cough  (17%);  thrombocytopenia  
(16%);  decreased  appetite  (13%);  pyrexia,  dyspnea,  upper  respiratory  tract infection  (12%  each);  
nasal  congestion  and neutropenia  (11%  each).  Grade  3 and higher  AEs were  reported  in 48% of 
subjects  treated  with 16 mg/kg  monotherapy  daratumumab.  The most  frequently  reported  Grade  
3 or higher  AEs were  anemia  (13%)  and thrombocytopenia  (9%).  All other  Grade  3 and higher  
AEs were  reported  in <5% of subjects.  No deaths  due to daratumumab -related  AEs have  been  
reported  in any ongoing  study.  
 
Among the 283 patients  who received daratumumab  in combination  with lenalidomide  and 
dexamethasone  in the POLLUX  trial12, please  see Table  7 and Table  8 (DRd  (N=283)  %) for  the 
most  frequently  reported  AEs (reported  in >10%  of subjects)  and the most  frequently  reported  
Grade  3 or higher  AEs. All other  Grade  3 and higher  AEs were  reported  in <5% of subjects.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
This study  will be conducted  at MSKCC.  Efforts  will be made  to ensure  that women  and 
minority  groups  are adequately  represented  in this trial.  Internally,  an effort  will be made  
to position  this protocol  for patients  that demonstrate  high-risk prognostic  features,  so as 
not to conflict  with other  ongoing  newly -diagnosed  multiple  myeloma  studies.   All patients  
will be seen  by MSKCC  myeloma  physicians  and associated  MSKCC  co-investigators,  
enrolled and registered  at MSKCC.  All co-investigators  agree  to follow  the treatment  in the 
protocol  and to conduct  the proposed  investigation  according  to recognized  principles  of 
good  clinical  practice.  Participation is voluntary.  Each  patient must  be informed  about  the 
neoplastic  nature  of his/her  disease  and willingly  consent  to participation  in this study.  
Every  patient  will be informed  of the procedures  to be followed,  the potential  benefits,  side 
effects,  risks,  and discomforts  of the trial and of potential  therapeutic  alternatives.  All 
participants  will be required to sign statements  of informed  consent  and research  
authorization  that conform  to FDA, IRB and HIPAA  guidelines.  Informed  consent  will be 
documented  by the use of a written consent  form that has been  approved  by the MSKCC  
IRB.

9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
Patients  who have  signed  the consent  form and are deemed eligible  for this clinical  trial will start 
therapy  with daratumumab  with the following  schedule:  
 
• Cycles  1 and 2: Daratumumab 16mg/kg  weekly  for 4 weeks  as intravenous  
infusion  
• Cycles  3-6: Daratumumab  16mg/kg  once every  2 weeks  for 4 weeks  as 
intravenous  infusion  
• Lenalidomide  maintenance  therapy  to be administered  as standard  treatment  to 
all patients.  
• Premedications:  
o Dexamethasone  20mg/dose  IV on Days  1, 8, 15, 22 for Cycles  1 and 2 and 
Day 1 and 15  for Cycles  3-6. Montelukast  10mg  PO for the first 4 weeks

• Prophylaxis  for Herpes  Zoster Reactivation  
o Initiate  antiviral  prophylaxis  to prevent  herpes  zoster reactivation  within  1 
week  of starting  DARZALEX  and continue  for 3 months  following  treatment  
 
• Management  of Hepatitis B Virus  Reactivation  
o Primary antiviral prophylaxis  is permitted  as per local  standard  of care.  
Per protocol, HBV  DNA testing  by PCR  is mandatory  for subjects at risk for 
HBV reactivation  see Section  10.0 
o For subjects  who are diagnosed  with HBV reactivation  while  on treatment,  
study  treatment should  be interrupted  until the infection  is adequately  
controlled. If the benefits  outweigh  the risks, study treatment  may be 
resumed  with concomitant  antiviral  prophylaxis  as per  local standard  of 
care.  Consult  a liver disease  specialist  as clinically  indicated.  
 
Infusion  Related  Reaction  (IRR)  Management - Daratumumab  
Severe  infusion  reactions  associated  with Daratumumab  include  bronchospasm,  hypoxia,  
dyspnea,  hypertension, laryngeal  edema  and pulmonary edema. Signs  and symptoms  may 
include  respiratory  symptoms,  such  as nasal congestion, cough, throat irritation,  as well as 
chills,  vomiting  and nausea.  Less  common  symptoms  were  wheezing,  allergic  rhinitis,  
pyrexia,  chest discomfort,  pruritus,  and hypotension.  Patients  will be pre-medicated  with 
antihistamines,  antipyretics  and corticosteroids  and frequently  monitored  during  entire  
infusion. Infusions  will be interrupted  for interactions  of any severity and  medical  
management  will be managed.  Daratumumab  will be permanently  discontinued  for life- 
threatening  (Grade  4) reactions. For patients  with Grade  1, 2, or 3 reactions, the infusion  
rate will be reduced  when  re-starting  the infusion.  To reduce  the risk of delayed  infusion  
reactions,  corticosteroids  will be given  to all patients.)].  Patients  with a history  of chronic  
obstructive  pulmonary disease  may require  additional post -infusion  medications  to manage  
respir atory  complications. In these  instances  post-infusion  short  and long-acting  
bronchodilators,  and inhaled  corticosteroids  medications  maybe  prescribed. If  the patient  
experiences  no major  infusion  reactions, following  the first four  infusions, these  additional  
inhaled  post-infusion  medications  may be discontinued.  
 
 
9.1. Hematologic Toxicity  
 
9.1.1  On day  1 of each  new cycle,  patients  must  meet  the following  criteria:  
• ANC  ≥ 1.0 x 109 /L 
• Platelet  count  ≥ 50 x 109 /L 
 
9.1.2  If these  conditions  are not met on  Day 1 of a new cycle:  
• The next cycle  of treatment  will not be initiated  until the above  conditions  
(section  9.3.1)  are met. If ANC and platelet  counts  do not satisfy  the 
requirements  above after  2 weeks  of withholding  treatment,  the subject  will 
go off therapy.  Transfusions  and growth  factors  are permissible.

9.2 Non-Hematologic  Toxicities  Requiring  Dosing Modifications  
 
9.2.1  Any ≥Grade 3 non-hematologic  toxicity  require daratumumab  to be held   
until resolved  to Grade  1 or baseline  prior to resuming  therapy  or initiating  
next cycle.  Investigator  will determine  which  drug will be held based  on side 
effect  profile  and clinical  judgment.  If therapy  has been  held for more  than 3 
weeks  due to non-hematologic  toxicity,  the patient  will be removed  from 
protocol  therapy.  
 
9.2.2  Protocol  therapy  will be withheld  for patients  who require  treatment  of 
Grade  3 infection. If therapy  has been  held for more  than 3 weeks due  to 
treating  a grade  3 infection,  the patient  will be removed  from protocol  
therapy.  
 
9.2.3  Electrolyte  or metabolic  abnormalities  that are reversible  with electrolyte  
replacement  within  72 hours  or < grade  3 infections  that can  be controlled  
by appropriate  therapy  are exempt  from holding  treatment  or dose  
modifications.  
 
 
9.3 Monitoring  
 
9.3.1  Routine labs  (CBC,  chemistry  panel  14, LDH, magnesium,  uric acid, phosphate)  
will be performed every  2 weeks  for the  first 2 cycles,  then on day 1 for cycle  3-6, 
at end of therapy.  Myeloma  tests include serum  protein electrophoresis,  serum  
immunofixation,  beta-2 microglobulin,  quantitative  immunoglobulins  and serum  
free light chains  assay  will be performed  at baseline,  start of each  cycle,  at end of 
therapy.  Routine  labs, and myeloma  labs can be performed  24 hrs in advance.  
 
9.3.2  Patients  will have  clinic  visits  with H&P or standard progress  notes  assessing  for 
toxicity/side  effects  at baseline,  day 1 of each cycle,  end of therapy,  1-month  after 
end of therapy.  Treatment  window  for day 1 of start of each  cycle  is +/- 7 days.  
Treatment  window  for intra-cycle daratumumab  doses is +/- 2 days.  
 
9.3.3  24-hr urine  sample  for protein  electrophoresis  (UPEP)  and immunofixation  will be 
performed at  baseline  
 
9.3.4  At CR/sCR  or end of therapy,  routine  labs (CBC,  chemistry  panel  14, LDH,  
magnesium,  uric acid, phosphate),  myeloma  specific  tests - serum  protein  
electrophoresis,  serum  immunofixation,  beta-2 microglobulin,  quantitative  
immunoglobulins  and serum  free light chains  assay,  lymphocyte  subsets,  24-hr 
urine  sample  for protein  electrophoresis  (UPEP)  and immunofixation  to assess  for 
monoclonal  protein  in the urine  (Bence -Jones  proteinuria).  A bone  marrow  aspirate  
will also be performed  to assess  the status  of minimal residual  disease  by flow 
cytometry  (Sample  sent will be the  first bone  marrow  “pull”) .  Patient  will have  clinic  
visit (relevant  clinical  laboratories and H&P)  1 month  after completing  combination  
therapy  to undergo  assessment  of toxicities/adverse  events.

a. Routine  tests include  CBC,  reticulocyte  count,  Chem  14, magnesium,  phosphate,  uric acid,  eGFR  determination  and LDH.  Reticulocyte  count  will 
only be performed  at baseline,  day 1 of every  cycle,  and end of therapy.  PT and PTT will only be performed  at baseline.  Peripheral  blood  
lymphocyte  subsets  at baseline,  C4D1,  and end of therapy  
b. Viral studies  include  Hep B surface  antigen,  Hep B surface  antibody,  Hep B core antibody  and Hep C antibody.  If Hep C antibody  positive,  Hep C 
RNA PCR will be performed.  Subjects  who are positive  for Anti-HBc or Anti-HBs will undergo  testing  for hepatitis  B DNA by PCR. Subjects  with 
serologic  findings  suggestive  of HBV vaccination  (Anti-HBs positivity  as the only serologic  marker)  and a known  history  of prior HBV vaccination  do 
not need  to be tested  for HBV DNA by PCR.  For subjects  with serologic  evidence  of resolved  HBV infection  (i.e., positive  Anti-HBs or positive  Anti- 
HBc)  at Screening,  HBV DNA testing  by PCR must  be performed  locally. Treatment  phase: Q12W  during  treatment,  at End of Treatment,  and Q12W  
for up to 6 months  after the last dose  of study  treatment.  
c. Pregnancy  tests (urine  or serum)  for females  of childbearing  potential.  A female  of childbearing  potential  (FCBP)  is a sexually  mature  female  who: 
1) has not undergone  a hysterectomy  or bilateral  oophorectomy;  or 2) has not been  naturally  postmenopausal for at least  24 consecutive  months  
(i.e., has had  menses  at any time in the preceding  24 consecutive  months)  
d. To be stored  at MSKCC  HOTB  biobank.  
e. Myeloma  tests include  serum protein  electrophoresis,  serum immunofixation,  24-hr urine  electrophoresis,  urine  immunofixation,  serum  free light 
chains,  quantitative  immunoglobulins,  beta-2 microglobulin  and will be performed  at baseline.  
f. Bone  marrow  aspiration  and biopsy  will be sent for histopathology,  flow cytometry,  FISH/cytogenetics.  Lysate  will also be sent for cell sorting  into 
CD 138- and + fractions  and whole  bone  marrow  lysate  for HOTB  storage  so molecular  profiling  with GEP and DNA-based  sequencing  at baseline  
can be performed  as correlative  work.  
g. Bone  marrow  aspirate  and biopsy  can be performed  +/- 21 days of intended  cycle  day or achievement  of CR/sCR.  Bone  marrow  aspirate  and 
biopsy  will be sent to evaluate  for histopathology,  flow cytometry  (bone  marrow  immunophenotyping  of plasma  cells),  heavy/light  chain  
immunoglobulin  rearrangement.  Aspirate  lysate  will also be sent for cell sorting  into CD 138- and +  fractions  and whole  bone  marrow  lysate  for 
HOTB  storage  so molecular  profiling  with GEP and DNA-based  sequencing at baseline  can be performed  as correlative  work.  For patients,  
reaching  CR/sCR  MRD  negative  timepoint  earlier  where  MRD  negative status  is confirmed  at earlier  bone  marrow  evaluation,  bone  marrow  
aspiration  and biopsy  at end of  study  will be optional.  Otherwise,  all other  bone  marrow  biopsies  are mandatory.  
h. After  study  therapy  ends,  follow -up will be 1 month  after study  end date.  Patients  may be followed  at more  frequent  time intervals, and thereafter  if 
clinically  indicated.  Patients  who have  progressive  disease  while  on therapy  will be followed  with restaging  scans  and laboratory  tests as clinically  
indicated.  At disease  progression,  marrow  and FDG-PET/CT  are optional  but recommended.  
i. For patients  with initial  baseline  24-hr UPEP  samples  demonstrating  ≥100  mg/24  hrs, patients  will continue  to have  24-hr UPEP  samples  day 1 of 
each  cycle.  Once  24-hr UPEP  is <100  mg/24  hrs, patient  can have  random  UPEP  with IFE until achieving  negativity.   If initial baseline  24-hr 
UPEP  sample  is IFE positive  and/or  <100  mg/24 hrs,  patients  can have random  UPEP  samples  with IFE until  achieving  negativity.  Once random  
UPEP and IFE is negative,  no further  urine  samples are needed  (unless  patient’s  disease is primarily  measurable  by 24 hr urines)  
j. FDG-PET scan will be performed on patients  at baseline,  end of therapy  ( +/- 21 days)  or upon  suspicion  of progressive  disease as clinically  
indicated.  
k. Variations  of +/- 7 days of scheduled  visits  are permitted.  
l. An echocardiogram  (2-D or strain) will only be performed  at baseline  if the patient has  had signs  of significant  cardiovascular  disease.  
Outside   echocardiograms  are permissible.  
m. If screening labs are performed within 5 days of C1D1 they  can be used  for treatment  on day 1. 
n. Variations of +/-21 days of scheduled visits are permitted.  
o. Bone Marrow  biopsy  and aspirate will  be required at time of serologic complete  response.  If patient  is MRD  negative on this bone

targeted  genes using  MSKCC  MyType  assay.  
Cell Sorting  and Bone  marrow  cell lysate  
Bone marrow  aspirate storage samples  will be sorted  into CD 138 + and CD  138 – fractions and  
whole  bone  marrow  cell lysate  per HOTB  SOP.  
Research Blood/Serum  and Urine  
a) One 7-8 mL serum  tube will be collected on Day 1, Day  8, Day 15, and Day  22 of Cycle  1 
and 2, Day 1 of every  cycle during  cycles  3-6, if and when  CR/sCR  is achieved,  at the end of 
therapy,  and at any time point  if the patient  has progression of disease.  One 7 -8 mL CPT 
tube will be collected  on Day 1 of every  cycle  during  cycles 1 -6, if and when   CR/sCR  is 
achieved,  at the end of therapy,  and at any time point  if the patient  has progression  of 
disease.  
b) Urine (random  samples  of 10 mL) will be collected  into a standard  urine  collection  cup and 
sent for analysis and  storage  at each  of the above time  points.  
 
c) Peripheral  blood  and/or  urine  samples  from patients  will be analyzed  for potential  serum  or 
urine  biomarkers  as well as drug concentrations,  and describe  the association  with clinical  
outcomes  if the results  of the study  indicate  a clinical  or translational  rationale  for analyzing  
the samples.  The samples  will be transferred  to the HOTB  and will be analyzed  there  per 
institutional  SOP.  
 
 
Assessment/Evaluation  Plan 
 
The protocol  consent  form asks participants  for permission  for re-contact  to discuss  research  
findings  if an incidental  research  finding is made  that may be critical  to their health or  preventive  
care, or that of their issue.  If a participant  agrees  to be re-contacted,  he/she  will not be told the 
specific results  of the research  test, but will be informed  that his/her  samples  were  used  in a project  
and a potential  risk was discovered.  If the participant  is interested in further  discussion  of the 
research  findings,  he/she  will be asked  to contact  MSKCC  Clinical  Genetics  Service  for counseling  
and specific  genetic  testing.  
 
In the event  an investigator's  research  identifies  a finding  that he or she believes  should  be 
communicated  to the subject  (and/or  family  designee),  the investigator  can communicate  that 
finding  to the IRB Genomic  Advisory  Panel  (GAP).  The finding will be reviewed  by the GAP to 
determine  whether  the incidental  finding  should  be discussed  with the participant.  For MSK,  in the 
event  that the  GAP  determi  nes that the finding should  be discussed  with the participant,  and the 
participant  has consented  to be re-contacted,  then the treati  ng/consenting  physician  shall be 
contacted  by the panel  and asked  to refer the participant  to the Clinical  Genetics  Service  for 
further  discussion  of the research  finding. 
 
After  appropriate  counseling  and consent,  the Clinical  Genetics  Service  will request  permission  to 
confirm   the result  in a New York DOH -approved laboratory  prior to communication  of the specific  
result.  If the patient  is not available (e.g.  deceased),  then the surrogate designated  on the consent  
will be contacted  and the above  will occur.

11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
11.1 Daratumumab  
 
 
Infusion  Related  Reactions  
 
Daratumumab  is an antibody. An antibody  is a large  protein  that is used  by the immune  system to 
identify  and neutralize  bacteria  and viruses. A side effect  to daratumumab  that occurs  during  or 
shortly  after an infusion  is completed  (when  the medicine  is given  into a vein)  is called  an infusion - 
related  reaction. Infusion –related  reactions  were  reported  in approximately  half of all patients  treated  
with daratumumab. It usually  occurs  with the first infusion  and during  or within  the first few hours  of 
the start of the infusion. Signs  and symptoms  of infusion -related  reactions  may include  respiratory  
symptoms, such  as stuffy  nose, cough,  throat  irritation, as well as chills, vomiting  and nausea. Less  
common  symptoms  are having  trouble  breathing  (wheezing),  runny nose, fever, chest discomfort,  
itching  of the skin, and low blood  pressure  or high blood  pressure.  Most of the observed  infusion - 
related  reactions  so far were  mild or moderate,  and ended  by temporarily  stopping  the infusion  and 
giving  medicines  to treat the side effect.  Tell your doctor  right away  if you have  above  mentioned  
symptoms.  
 
If you have  a breathing  problem now or had breathing  problems  in the past (like chronic  obstructive  
pulmonary  disease  (COPD) or asthma), you  should  tell your study  doctor. Also, if you start to have  
breathing  problems  while  you are on the study  you should  tell your study  doctor  right away. You  may 
be asked  to see a doctor  who takes  care of patients  with airway  diseases, and additional  medicines  
for airway  problems  may be given  to you. Your doctor  will explain  how these  additional  medicines  
should  be taken. Get emergency  medical  help if you have  any of following: hives, wheezing, difficulty  
breathing, swelling  of your face,  lips, tongue, or throat or pain in chest.  
 
Severe  reactions  have  occurred, including  narrowing  and obstruction  of the respiratory  airway  
(bronchospasm), low  oxygen,  shortness  of breath, high blood  pressure, swelling  in the throat and 
fluid accumulation  in the lungs  (pulmonary  edema). Your study  doctor and their staff will be ready  to 
treat such a reaction  in case it happens. In the future, you  should  tell any doctor  you visit that you 
received  daratumumab  (an antibody) in this research  study  and if you had an allergic  reaction  
including  anaphylaxis, the worst case  of allergic  reaction.  
 
The sponsor will  continue  to monitor  infusion -related  reactions  and make  changes  to the way 
daratumumab  is administered  and/or recommend  additional  medications  as necessary.  
 
In this study, the following  will be done  to reduce  the chance  of a daratumumab  infusion  related  
reaction:  
• You will get medications, including  steroids, acetaminophen  and antihistamine, before  the 
infusion.  
• If you have  a reaction, the infusion  will be paused  and the symptoms  treated  as needed.  
Dependent on the reaction, the infusion  may continue  at a slower  rate. If you have  a life- 
threatening  reaction, you  will need  to stop further  treatment with  daratumumab  and your 
doctor will  discuss  alternative  treatments  with you.

• If you are considered  higher risk  for breathing  problems  (for example  COPD, asthma),  you 
may also get medications, including  inhaled  steroids, after  the infusion.  
• You may stay overnight in hospital  after the infusion  so medical  staff can check  you. 
 
 
Possible Side  Effects  of Daratumumab  
 
Among  the 151 subjects  treated  with 16 mg/kg  daratumumab  as monotherapy  in Studies   GEN501  
and MMY2002,  the most  frequently  reported  AEs (reported  in >10%  of subjects)  were  fatigue  
(29%);  anemia  (23%);  nausea  (19%);  back pain (18%);  cough  (17%);  thrombocytopenia   (16%);  
decreased  appetite  (13%);  pyrexia, dyspnea,  upper  respiratory  tract infection  (12%  each);   nasal  
congestion  and neutropenia  (11%  each).  Grade  3 and higher  AEs were  reported  in 48% of subjects  
treated  with 16 mg/kg  monotherapy  daratumumab.  The most  frequently  reported  Grade  3 or higher  
AEs were  anemia  (13%)  and thrombocytopenia  (9%).  All other  Grade  3 and higher  AEs were  
reported  in <5% of subjects.  No deaths  due to daratumumab -related  AEs have  been  reported  in 
any ongoing  study.  
 
Among the 283 patients  who received daratumumab  in combination  with lenalidomide  and 
dexamethasone  in the POLLUX  trial12, please  see Table  7 and Table  8 (DRd  (N=283)  %) for  the 
most  frequently  reported  AEs (reported  in >10%  of subjects)  and the most  frequently  reported  
Grade  3 or higher  AEs. All other  Grade  3 and higher  AEs were  reported  in <5% of subjects.

Indirect  Antiglobulin  Testing  
 
Daratumumab  treatment  will affect  one of these  tests known  as an indirect  antiglobulin  test (IAT;  
also known  as an indirect  Coombs  test).  Therefore,  an IAT will be done  before  receiving  
daratumumab.  
 
Birth  control  and pregnancy  during  the study  
 
The effects  of daratumumab  on fertility,  the human  embryo,  the fetus,  or the breast -fed infant  are 
unknown.  Both male  and female  patients  must  use effective  methods  of birth control  during  the 
course  of the study  and for 3 months  after stopping  daratumumab.  Women  must  not donate  eggs  
during  the study  and for 3 months  after your last dose  of study  drug.  Men must  not donate  sperm  
during the study  and for 3 months after your last dose  of study  drug.  
 
 
 
 
12.1 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Disease Parameters  
 
 
Minimal  Residual  Disease  
For patients  undergoing  MRD  or end of study  assessment, the first pulled  bone  marrow  sample will 
be sent for multi-parametric  flow cytometry  as a priority.   Flow  cytometry  based  assay  to rule out 
MRD in bone  marrow  aspirates  and for MRD  negative  status  using  an assay  with a sensitivity  of at 
least  1 in 10 ^ -5 cells. Patients  with <CR/sCR  are considered MRD  positive.  We will use the  
MSKCC  flow cytometry  MRD  method  which  is based  on 10 -colors  in a single  tube.16. The test 
demonstrates  highly  similar  results  when compared to the current  Euroflow  approach.  This test is 
validated  and already in clinical  use at MSK.  Immunophenotyping  of aberrant  plasma  cells by flow 
cytometry  currently  involves,  but is not limited to,  the use of the following  reagents:  CD138,  CD19,  
CD45,  CD38, and CD56.  Characteristic   changes  in immunophenotypically  abnormal  plasma  cells 
(CD38 bright  and/or  CD138  positive)  
include  but are not limited  to decreased  or absent  CD19  and CD45,  decreased  CD38,  increased  
CD56,  decreased  CD27,  decreased CD81,  increased CD117.

24h. If the serum  and urine  M-protein  are unmeasurable,  a ≥ 90% decrease  in the 
difference  between  involved  and uninvolved  FLC levels  is required in place  of the M- 
protein criteria.  
d) Partial  Response  (PR) 
o ≥ 50% reduction in  M protein  and reduction  in 24 -h urinary  M-protein  by ≥ 90% or to < 
200 mg per 24h. If the serum  and urine  M-protein  are unmeasurable,  a ≥ 90% 
difference  between  involved  and uninvolved  FLC levels  is required in place  of the M- 
protein  criteria  
e) Stable  Disease (SD)  
o Not meeting  criteria  for CR, VGPR,  PR or progressive  disease.  All categories also 
require  no known  evidence of progressive  or new bone  lesions  if radiographic  studies  
were  performed.  Radiographic studies are not  required to satisfy  these  response  
requirements.  
f) Progressive disease  (PD) 
o Requires  any one or more  of the following:  
▪ Increase  of ≥ 25% of nadir  in: 
▪ Serum  M-component  and/or  (absolute  increase  must be  ≥ 0.5 g/dl. The 
serum M-component  increases  of ≥ 1gm/dl  are sufficient  to define  relapse  if 
starting  M-component  is ≥ 5 gm/dl.  
▪ Urine M -component  and/or  (the absolute  increase  must  be ≥ 200 mg/24h  
▪ Only in patients without measurable  serum  and urine  M-protein  levels:  the 
difference  between involved  and uninvolved FLC levels.  The absolute  
increase  must  be >10mg/dl.  
▪ Bone  marrow  plasma  cell percentage:  the absolute  % must  be ≥ 10% 
▪ Definite  development  of new bone  lesions  or soft  tissue plasmacytomas  or 
definite  increase in size of existing  bone  lesions  or soft tissue  
plasmacytomas  
▪ Development  of that can be attributed  solely  to the plasma  cell proliferative  
disorder  
g) Relapse  from CR 
o Any one or more  of the following:  
▪ Reappearance  of serum  or urine  M-protein  by immunofixation  or 
electrophoresis.   (Appearance  of monoclonal  or oligoclonal  bands  that are 
different  from original  isotype  may not be defined  as “relapse  from CR”. 
Often  times,  such  bands  may indicate  fluctuations  in immunological  
parameters  that are not reflective  of MM disease.  In these  situations,  
immunofixation  and electrophoresis  will be interpreted  by the clinician  before  
being  labeled as  “relapse”23,24. 
▪ Development  of ≥ 5% plasma  cells in the bone  marrow  
▪ Appearance  of any other  sign of progression  (i.e., new plasmacytoma,  lytic

14.1 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
Study  Design/Primary  Endpoints  
 
This is a single arm  phase  II study  designed  to evaluate the efficacy  of short  course  therapy  with 
daratumumab,  in multiple  myeloma  patients  achieving  a VGPR or  better  with MRD  positive  state  
while  on lenalidomide  maintenance  for at least 6 months  at the time of enrollment.  The primary  
objective  of this study  is to determine  the rate of conversion to MRD  negativity  by the completion of 
6 cycles  of treatment.  
 
Rationale  
 
The primary  objective  of this trial is to determine  whether  treatment  with daratumumab is  associated  
with a substantial  fraction of patients  with MRD  positive  multiple myeloma  converting  to a MRD  
negative  state as assessed  by multicolor  flow cytometry.  Previously  studies  have reported  that 
approximately  10% of patients  will achieve  deeper responses  including  MRD  negativity  after 
maintenance  therapy  with lenalidomide  alone18. The current  study  will be considered positive if the 
rate of MRD  negativity  is 30% or higher  with daratumumab.  
 
Power Calculations  
 
This study  will implement  a Simon’s  two-stage  minimax  design  to distinguish  between  an 
unpromising  rate of 10% and a promising  rate of 30%.  The study  is designed  to have  a type I error 
and a type II error of 0.10. The maximum  sample  size is 25 patients.  
 
Primary  analysis  
 
In the first stage of the study,  a total of 16 patients  will accrue.  If 2 or more  patients  achieve  MRD  
negativity,  additional  9 patients  will accrue.  If at the end of the study,  5 patients  or more out  the total 
25 patients  achieve  MRD  negativity,  the short  course daratumumab  will be considered  promising  for 
future investigation.  
Accrual  will be held after  the 16th patient  if 2 or more  patients have  not yet  achieved MRD  negativity.  
We anticipate  that one to two patients will  accrue  each  month.  
 
Analysis population  for primary  endpoint  
 
All patients  who receive  at least one dose  of daratumumab  will be considered  evaluable  for the 
primary  endpoint.  Patients  who do not have  the end of therapy  bone  marrow  for any reason  and 
have  not achieved  MRD  negativity  at any point  while  on study  will be considered  a treatment  failure.  
 
 
Secondary  endpoints : 
 
1. To estimate  the rate of sustained  MRD  negativity.  Among  patients  achieving  MRD  negativity,  
sustained negativity  is defined as remaining  MRD  negative  at the 1-year post treatment  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

completion  bone  marrow  biopsy.  The proportion along  with the 95% confidence  interval  will 
be estimated.  
 
2. Kaplan -Meier  methodology  will be used  to estimate  the duration  of MRD  negativity.  This 
endpoint  is defined  as the time from MRD  negativity achievement  to MRD  positivity,  
progression  of disease,  or death.  The median along  with the corresponding  95% 
confidence  interval will be  estimated.  
 
3. To explore  the concordance  of different  MRD  methodologies.  MRD  status  by multiparametric  
flow cytometry  will be compared  to next-generation sequencing  and to mass  spectrometry  
based  proteomics  methodologies.  The kappa  statistic  will be reported.  
 
4. Kaplan -Meier  methodology  will be used  to estimate  progression -free survival  and overall  
survival.  Estimates  of survival  along  with 95% confidence  intervals  will be provided  for select  
time points.  
 
 
Exploratory  Studies:  
 
1. The gene  panel  MyType  (or alternative  equivalent  platform)  will explore  whether  any mutations  
appear  to be  associated  with the achievement  of MRD  negativity.  This analysis  is for hypothesis - 
generation,  and all results  will be cautiously  interpreted.  Fisher’s  exact  test may be used to assess  
any potential  association.  The variant  allele  frequency  (VAF)  will be summarized  for each  
mutation.  VAFs will  be adjusted  for the cancer  cell fraction.  All results will  be adjusted  for multiple  
comparisons.  
 
2. MyType (or alternative  equivalent  platform)  will also be evaluated using samples  at the  time of 
progression  of disease and will be compared  to the pre-treatment  baseline samples  to explore  
whether  pathways  leading  to emergence  of resistance  to the drug regimen  can be identified.  
Similar  to the previous  objective,  this aim is for hypothesis  generation,  and all results  will be 
cautiously  interpreted.  Changes  in the VAF from baseline  will be summarized  for patients  with an 
ongoing  response  and for patients who have  progression of disease.  A paired  t-test may be used  
to further  describe  this association.  VAFs will  be adjusted  for the cancer  cell fraction.  
 
15.1 RESEARCH  PARTICIPANT  REGISTRATION  AND  RANDOMIZATION  PROCEDURES  
 
15.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section entitled  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.  
 
Obtain  informed consent, by following  procedures defined in section  entitled  Informed  Consent  
Procedures.   During  the registration  process  registering  individuals  will be required to  
complete  a protocol specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  The individual signing the Eligibility  Checklist  
is confirming  whether  or not the participant  is eligible to enroll  in the study.  
 
Study  staff are responsible  for ensuring  that all institutional  requirements  necess ary to  enroll  a 
participant  to the study  have  been  completed.   See related Clinical  Research  Policy  and 
Procedure  #401  (Protocol  Participant  Registration).

This study  will not include  randomization.  
 
16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
All patients  will be enrolled  on protocol  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center.  We 
expect  to be able to enroll  the necessary  25 patients  into this study  in 2 years.  
 
The study  coordinator (Clinical  Research Associate,  CRA)  will be responsible  for confirming  
eligibility  and assisting  the MD with the registration  process.  All study  data will be collected  
by an assigned  data manager  (Clinical  Research  Coordinator,  CRC) who will enter  this 
information into  the Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB).  This database  will be utilized  for 
data collection  and storage and  for reporting  protocol  specific  events  such  as accrual  
demographics,  toxicities  and adverse events  to the IRB, and the sponsor.  
 
The CRC  will collect  toxicity  and concomitant  medication  information  and patient  interviews.  
Adverse  events,  including  all toxic effects  of treatment  will be tabulated  individually  according  
to severity  or toxicity  grade.  The data manager  will also monitor  laboratory  testing  throughout  
the study.  Laboratory  data will be tabulated  and summarized by descriptive  statistics,  as well 
as on  the basis  of MSKCC  specified normal  ranges.  
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Monthly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  
of registration data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual rates,  extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be 
monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  to 
the attention of the study  team  for discussion and  action.  
 
Random  sample data  quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted by the study  
team,  at a minimum  of two times per year, more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
 
16.3 Data and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Plan utilized  for this study  must align  with the MSK  DSM  Plan, 
where  applicable.  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial Sloan  Kettering  were  approved  by 
the Nation al Cancer Institute  in August 2018. The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by 
the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National Cancer  Institute  for Data  and Safety     
Monitoring  of Clinical Trials .” 
 
There  are several  different mechanisms  by which  clinical studies  are monitored  for data, safety  
and quality.  At a departmental/PI level there  exists  procedures  for quality  control by the 
research  team(s). Institutional processes  in place  for quality  assurance  include  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  staff education  on clinical research  QA and 
two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

trials  programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I 
and II clinical trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  
trials, report to the Deputy  Physician -in-Chief, Clinical Research.  
 
The degree  of monitoring  required  will be determined  based on  level of risk and documented.  
 
The MSK  DSMB  monitors  phase  III trials  and the DSMC  monitors  non-phase  III trials.  The 
DSMB/C  have  oversight over  the following  trials:  
• MSK  Investigator Initiated  Trials  (IITs; MSK  as sponsor)  
• External studies  where  MSK  is the data coordinating  center  
• Low risk studies  identified  as requiring  DSMB/C  review  
 
The DSMC  will initiate  review  following  the enrollment of the first participant/or  by the end of 
the year one if no accruals  and will continue  for the study  lifecycle  until there  are no 
participants under active  therapy  and the protocol  has closed  to accrual.  The DSMB  will initiate  
review  once  the protocol  is open  to accrual.  
 
 
17.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
Participation in this trial is voluntary.  All patients  will be required  to sign a statement  of 
informed  consent, which  must  conform to MSKCC  and collaborating  centers  IRB guidelines.  
Patients  will be eligible  for this trial regardless  of gender  or racial/ethnic  background.   All 
patients  must  follow  the guidelines  for pregnancy  testing  birth control  and counseling  related  
to the risk of fetal exposu re to lenalidomide  and bortezomib.  
 
The protocol  for this study  has been designed  in accordance  with the general  ethical  
principles  outlined in the Declaration  of Helsinki.  The review  of this protocol  by the IRB and 
the performance  of all aspects  of the study,  including  the methods  used  for obtaining  
informed  consent,  must  also be in accordance  with principles  enunciated in  the declaration,  
as well as ICH Guidelines,  Title 21 of the Code  of Federal  Regulations  (CFR),  Part 50 
Protection of Human Subjects  and Part 56 Institutional  Review  Boards.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSK’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected health  information  
pursuant  to a completed and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited to the individuals  described in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research Authorization  form must  be completed by the Principal  
Investigator  and approved  by the IRB and Privacy Board (IRB/PB).  
 
The consent  also indicates that  samples  and genetic  information  collected  may be shared  
with other  qualified  researchers.  Such  information  will not include identifying  information  such  
as name.  It is also stated  in the consent  and Research  Authorization  that research  data (e.g. 
genomic  sequence) may be placed into databases  monitored  by the National  Institutes  of 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 18 -048 A(10)

Health,  and may be made  accessible  to investigators  approved by the U.S. government.  
 
Consent  for re-contact  
 
Patients  are asked in a series  of check  boxes  at the end of the consent  if 1) if they consent  to 
be contacted  to discuss  research  findings  which  may derive  from their sample;  and 2) if not 
available (e.g. deceased),  if they wish to have  their designated  representative  on the consent  
to be  contacted.  
 
Use of identifiable  information  for genetic studies  
 
It will be explained to participants  that future  research  may also be done  to identify  changes  
in genes  that predict  risk for cancer  or other  diseases;  if such  germline  genetic  research  is 
performed,  then to be in  compliance  with New York State law  (see section  3.5), it will not be 
possible to provide  results  of research  tests not performed in  a New York State  Department  
of Health approved clini cal laboratory.  It is stated in the consent  that participants  will be told 
that they will not receive  any specific  results  from potential  research  tests. The consent  will 
tell participants  that if they wish to have  genetic  testing  done  for personal  reasons  than they 
should  make an appointment  with the MSKCC  Clinical  Genetics  Service.  
 
If in the course  of this research  a research  finding  is obtained  that may be critical  to the 
preventive care of the participant  or their family,  as determined  by procedures  overseen by 
the IRB, those  participants,  if they consent  to checklist  questions  1, 2, will be referred  to the 
Clinical  Genetics  Service  for a consultation.  At that time,  genetic  counseling  can be offered  in 
accordance  with New York State  requirements,  and appropriate  clinical  testing  offered in  an 
approved laboratory.  Please  see flow chart  and requirements  for reporting  under  section  
10.0.  
 
Patients  will be informed  that future  research  may also identify  changes  in genes  that predict  
risks for cancer  or other  diseases.  Procedures  for informing  patients or  their designees,  
confirmation  by a New York State  approved  laboratory,  and follow -up assessments  and 
counseling  are already  detailed  in Section 10.0 above.  
 
For tumor  (somatic)  genetic studies,  germline studies of genetic  variants  of unknown  
significance  (e.g. for example,  in pharmacogenetics  studies),  gene  discovery  studies,  and 
cellular,  immunologic,  or other  studies  using banked  correlative  tissues,  the name  and 
personal  identifiers  may be removed  from the sample,  but a coded  link will be maintained.  
 
Research analysis  of tumor  genomes  may inadvertently  reveal,  or require  some  knowledge  
of the germline  genome.  Such  research  studies  could  be performed  on samples not 
identifiable  to the researcher  but with identifying  links maintained  by the TPS,  HOTB  or 
similar,  and approved  via IRB mechanisms.  See section  10.0 for instructions  on how to 
report  incidental  findings  on research  samples.  
 
Future  use of sample s 
 
Researchers  at MSKCC  may either  keep  indefinitely  or dispose  of any specimen(s)  collected  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 18 -048 A(10)  
Approval date: 02 -Feb-2023

under  this protocol  including  DNA that the samples  contain.  Specimens will be stored with  
identifiers  in secure  banks  at MSKCC.   Samples  could be lost or ruined  because  of 
mechanical  failure,  and MSKCC cannot  guarantee  that samples  will be stored  indefinitely.  
The samples  will be stored  for as long  as deemed  useful  for research  purposes.  
 
Risks  of research  participation  
 
Risks  are those of the procedure  to obtain  the specimen and are considered minimal.  
Another  risk is release  of information  from health  or research  records  in a way that violates  
privacy  rights.   MSKCC  protects  records so that name,  address,  phone  number,  and any 
other information  that identifies  the participant  will be kept private  and confidential,  along  with 
all personal  health  information.  
Benefits of research  participation  
 
It is unlikely  that the research using  biospecimens  will be of any medical  benefit  to 
participants.   Neither  the patient  nor the treating  physician  will necessarily  be told of the 
results  of any research  tests on the samples,  except  an incidental  finding  that may be critical  
to the preventive  care of the subject  or his/her  issue.   Research  using  biospecimens  
collected in this study  could  lead to medical  and scientific products  that could  improve  
prevention,  diagnosis,  and treatment  of disease;  but those  benefits are unlikely  to accrue  to 
the participants.  
 
Occasionally,  however,  there are tests  conducted  in research labs, the results  of which  might  
contribute  toward  treatment  decisions.  These studies  would  not yet have  been  reduced  to 
clinical  practice,  but patients  may be informed  of such  results  and how they may affect  
diagnosis  and treatment . 
 
 
 
 
Costs/compensation  
 
There  is no cost to enroll or participate in this research.  Biospecimens  obtained  under  this 
research  protocol  may be used  to make  secondary  products,  and such products  may be 
patented  or licensed with commercial  value.   Participants  are not financially  compensated  for 
use of their human biological  specimens  or secondary  products,  tests,  and discoveries  that 
derive from their biospecimens.  
 
17.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal life  functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect

Version:  2/26/16   
  
 
• Important  Medical Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death, be life threatening, or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical  
judgment, they  may jeopardize  the patient  of participant  and may require  medical or 
surgical intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note:  Hospital admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  is not considered  an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  treatment/  
intervention.  SAE reporting  is required  for 30-days  after the participant’s  last investigational  
treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur after the 30 -day period  that is  unexpected  and at 
least  possibly  related  to protocol  treatment must  be reported.  
 
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational treatment/intervention  
and is related  to a screening  test of procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy) must  be reported.  
 
All SAEs  must  be submitted  in PIMS.  If an SAE requires  submission  to the HRPP  office  per 
IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be submitted  
within  5 calendar days  of the event.  All other SAEs  must be submitted  within  30 calendar days  
of the event.  
 
The report should  contain  the following  information:  
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event to the treatment(s)  
• If the adverse  event  was expected  
• Detailed  text that includes  the following  
o An explanation  of how the adverse  event  was handled  
o A description  of the participant’s  condition  
o Indication  if the participant remains  on the study  
• If an amendment will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or consent form  
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated  Problem

events  will be reported  for 30 days  after the last dose  of study  drug.  
 
Adverse Event  (AE) Definition:  
 
An adverse event  is any  untoward medical  occurrence  in a clinical  study  subject  administered  
a medicinal  (investigational  or non-investigational)  product.  An adverse  event  do 
es not  necessarily  have  a causal  relationship  with the treatment.  An adverse  event  can 
therefore  be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  finding),  symptom,  
or disea se temporally  associated  with the use of a medicinal  (investigational  or non - 
investigational)  product, whether  or not related  to that medicinal  (investigational or  non- 
investigational)  product.  (Definition  per International  Conference  on Harmonisation  [ICH])  
 
This includes  any occurrence  that is new in  onset  or aggravated  in severity  or frequency  from 
the baseline  condition,  or abnormal  results  of diagnostic  procedures,  including  laboratory  test 
abnormalities.  
 
Adverse Event  of Special  Interest  Definition:  
 
Adverse  events  of special  interest  are events  that Janssen  Scientific  Affairs,  LLC is actively  
monitoring  as a result  of a previously  identified  signal  (even  if non-serious).  These  adverse  
events  are: 
• Infusion  reactions:  ≥ grade 3 
• Infections:  ≥ grade  4 
• Cytopenias:  ≥ grade  4 
• HBV Reactivation  
• Other  malignancies  
 
Any Adverse Event  of Special  Interest  that is to be reported  to the COMPANY  should be recorded on a 
Serious Adverse Event  Report  Form  and be reported  to the COMPANY  within 24 hours of  knowledge  of the 
event.

Individual  Case Safety  Report  (ICSR)  Definition:  
 
A valid ICSR  must  contain  the four minimum  criteria  required  to meet  regulatory  reporting  
requirements.  
• an identifiable  subject  (but not disclosing  personal  information  such  as the subject’s  
name,  initials  or address)  
• an identifiable  reporter  (investigational  site) 
• a J&J medicinal product  
• an adverse event,  outcome,  or certain special  situations  
 
The minimum  information  required is: 
• suspected J&J medicinal  product  (doses,  indication)  
• date of therapy  (start  and end date,  if available)  
• batch  or lot number,  if available  
• subject  details  (subject  ID and country)  
• gender  
• age at AE onset  
• reporter  ID 
• adverse  event  detail  (AE verbatim  in English),  onset  date,  relatedness,  causality,  
action taken,  outcome,  (if available)  
• J&J protocol  ID 
 
Product  Quality  Complaint  (PQC)  
A product  quality  compliant  is defined as any suspicion  of a product  defect  related  to a 
potential  quality  issue during  manufacturing,  packaging,  release  testing,  stability  monitoring,  
dose  preparation,  storage  or distribution of the product,  or delivery  system.   Not all PQCs  
involve  a subject.   Lot and batch  numbers are of high significance  and need  to be collected  
whenever  available.  
 
Examples  of PQC include  but not limited  to: 
• Functional Problem:  e.g., altered delivery  rate in a controlled release  product  
• Physical  Defect:  e.g. abnormal  odor,  broken  or crushed  tablets/capsules  
• Potential  Dosing  Device  Malfunction:  e.g.,   autoinjector  button  not working,  needle  
detaching  from syringe  
• Suspected  Contamination  
• Suspected  Counterfeit  
 
Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  
 
A serious  adverse  event  based  on ICH and EU Guidelines  on Pharmacovigilance  for 
Medicinal  Products  for Human Use  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  that at any dose:  
 
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening  
(The subject  was at risk of death  at the time of the event.  It does not  refer to an  event  
that hypothetically  might  have caused  death  if it were  more  severe.)  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Is a suspect ed transmission  of any infectious  agent  via a medicinal  product

• Is medically  important*  
 
*Medical  and scientific  judgment  should be exercised in deciding  whether  expedited  reporting  
is also appropriate  in other  situations,  such  as important medical  events  that may not be 
immediately  life threatening  or result  in death  or hospitalization  but may jeopardize  the 
subject  or may require  intervention  to prevent  one of the other  outcomes  listed  in the 
definition above.  These  should usually  be considered  serious.  
 
NOTE:  DEATH  FOR  ANY REASON SHOULD  BE REPORTED  AS A SERIOUS  ADVERSE  
EVENT.  
 
Hospitalization  
For reports  of hospitalization,  it is the sign, symptom  or diagnosis  which  led to the 
hospitalization that is the serious  event  for which  details  must  be provided.  
 
Any event  requiring  hospitalization  or prolongation  of hospitalization  that occurs  during  
the study  must  be reported  as a serious  adverse  event,  except  hospitalizations  for the 
following:  
• Hospitalizations  not intended  to treat an acute  illness  or adverse  event  (e.g.,  
social  reasons  such  as pending  placement  in long-term care facility)  
• Surgery  or procedure  planned before  entry  into the study.  [Note:  Hospitalizations  
that were  planned before  the start of data collection  and where  the underlying  
condition  for which  the hospitalization  was planned  has not worsened will not be 
considered  serious  adverse events.  Any adverse  event  that results  in a 
prolongation of the originally  planned hospitalization  is to be reported  as a new 
serious  adverse  event.]  
• [For convenience  the investigator  may choose  to hospitalize the subject  for the 
duration  of the treatment  period.]  
 
Life-Threatening  Conditions  
Disease progression  should  not be recorded  as an adverse event  or serious  adverse  
event  term;  instead,  signs  and symptoms  of clinical  sequelae  resulting  from disease  
progression/lack  of efficacy  will be reported  if they fulfill the serious  adverse  event  
definition.  
Unlisted  (Unexpected)  Adverse Event/Reference  Safety  Information  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  unlisted  if the nature  or severity  is not consistent  with the 
applicable  product  reference  safety  information.  For a medicinal  product(s)  with a marketing  
authorization,  the expectedness  of an adverse  event  will be determined  by whether  or not it 
is listed in the applicable  product  information.  
 
http://www.darzalex.com/shared/product/darzalex/darzalex -prescribing -information.pdf  
 
For DARZALEX™  (daratumumab), the expectedness  of an adverse  event  will be 
determined  by whether  or not it is listed  in the Investigator's  Brochure

20.0 APPENDICES  
 
Appendix  A 
 
 
To characterize  bone  marrow  aspirate  specimens  for somatic  base  mutations and copy  number  
alterations  in key cancer -associated  genes,  we will perform  a custom,  targeted deep -sequencing  
assay  on matched  tumor  and normal  pairs.  The assay,  termed  MYTYPE involves  massively  parallel  
sequencing,  coupled with solution -phase  exon  capture.  Exon capture  will be performed  on 
barcoded pools of sequence libraries  by hybridization  (Nimblegen  SeqCap  Target  Enrichment)  using  
custom  oligonucleotides  to capture all exons  and select  introns  of 585 cancer  genes,  including  all 
genes  significantly  mutated  in hematologic  malignancies.  Barcoded pools  will subsequently  be 
sequenced  on an Illumina  HiSeq  2500  to 500-1000x  coverage per  sample  in order to maximize  
sensitivity  for detecting  low-abundance  alterations.  Through  many  iterations  of the design  of the 
capture  probe  set, we have  maximized the coverage  uniformity  across  all exons  in our panel,  thus 
reducing the number  of poorly -covered exons.  As a result,  for a sample  sequenced  by MYTYPE   to 
1000x  coverage,  >98% of target  exons  are covered  at >500x.  The platform  includes  all genes  that 
are druggable  by approved therapies or are targets  of experimental  therapies being  investigated  in 
clinical  trials at MSKCC.  Custom  probes  have  been  designed  to capture  translocations  involving  
recurrently  rearranged  genes.

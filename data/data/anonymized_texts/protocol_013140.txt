SCYNEXIS, Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product:  
Ibrexafungerp 
Name of Active Ingredient:  
Ibrexafungerp 
Protocol Number: 
SCY-078-121 Phase: 1 Country:  US 
Title of Study:  
An Open -Label Pharmacokinetic Study in Healthy Lactating Women after Two Oral Doses of 
Ibrexafungerp Administered on a Single Day 
Study center(s): One (1) to 2 sites  
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: July 2023 Estimated date last patient completed: July 2024 
Objectives:  
Primary Objective:  
• To determine whether ibrexafungerp is excreted in breast milk and if so, to characterize 
ibrexafungerp pharmacokinetics (PK) in the breast milk and plasma of lactating women. 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To calculate the potential infant exposure to ibrexafungerp if lactating women are treated with ibrexafungerp. 
• To characterize the safety and tolerability of ibrexafungerp in lactating women. 
Study Design:  
Ibrexafungerp is approved in the United States as a single day, two -dose therapy for women with 
vulvovaginal candidiasis  (VVC) . This is a Phase 1 study designed to determine whether this dose of 
ibrexafungerp is excreted in breast milk, and if so, to characterize ibrexafungerp PK in the breast milk 
and plasma of lactating women. 
Participants will receive a single day of twice daily (BID)  300- mg (2 x 150- mg) oral ibrexafungerp 
doses given 12 hours apart ( Q12H ). Participants will receive both doses on site. Participants will be 
admitted to the clinic on Day -1, and may be discharged on Day 5, after the 108-hour procedures are 
completed, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Product, Dose, and Timing  Study Day  
Ibrexafungerp 300-mg BID on Day 1  1 
Safety will be monitored with laboratory and clinical  evaluations: vital signs, physical examinations, 
and the collection of adverse events  (AE)  and concomitant medications . Breast milk and plasma PK

  samples will be obtained at selected intervals and time points pre -dose and post -dose for 
determination of ibrexafungerp concentrations.  
An interim analysis will be performed after 5 subjects have completed the study.  
Number of participant s (planned):  
Up to 10 healthy lactating females who are at least 10 days  postpartum with a full y established  milk 
supply and are between the ages of 18 and 50 years at the time of screening.  Participants who 
discontinue or are discontinued may be replaced to ensure that an adequate number of participants to 
achieve the study objectives, complete the study.  
Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
The study drug, ibrexafungerp citrate salt tablets, will be provided as oral 150 -mg tablets, by the 
Sponsor.  
All participant s will receive  ibrexafungerp in two 300- mg (2  x150- mg tablets) oral doses given Q12H  
with food.  
Ibrexafungerp citrate salt tablets will be stored at room temperature  in a secure  and locked  location in 
the clinical research unit . 
Duration of Treatment:  
The duration of study participation from pre -study through post -study safety monitoring will be 
approximately 4 to 5 weeks for participant s. 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Breast milk will be obtained up to 108 hours post dose and blood samples will be obtained starting 
pre-dose the Day 1 morning dose until 108  hours post  first dose of study drug for determination of 
ibrexafungerp concentrations. Sample time points are as follows:  
• Breast Milk :  complete expression  of milk from both breasts (using a standard electric breast 
pump) will be obtained at the following timepoints  and intervals: pre -dose, 0- 2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, 
12-18, 18- 24, 24- 36, 36- 48, 48 -72, and 72- 108 hours post fi rst dose of study drug.  
• Plasma samples  will be obtained at the following timepoints :  0 hours (prior to first dose), and at 
2, 6, 8, 12 (prior to second dose) , 24, 36, 48, 72, and 108  hours post first dose of study drug for 
determination of ibrexafungerp in plasma concentrations. The 12- hour samples will be taken 
prior to the second dose of ibrexafungerp.  
The following plasma pharmacokinetic parameters: area under the curve (AUC), peak plasma 
concentration (C max), time to peak plasma concentration (T max), plasma clearance or apparent oral 
clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V d), and terminal half -life (t 1/2) for ibrexafungerp 
following oral administration of the VVC dosage regimen for ibrexafungerp will be determined for 
both breast milk and plasma concentrations.  
The daily infant dosage (total drug present in milk and consumed by the infant per day) will be calculated:  
• Daily Infant Dosage (mg/day) = Σ (total drug concentration in each milk collection 
multiplied by the expressed milk volume in each milk collection)  
The Milk Plasma ratio (M/P) will be calculated. M/P = AUC
0-24 milk/AUC 0-24 plasma.  
The calculation of M/P should be based on AUC and on multiple time points over 24 hours and not 
just a single point in time.  
The relative infant dose (the percent of the weight -adjusted maternal dosage consumed in breast milk 
over 24 hours) will be calculated:  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.   US IND Number 107,521  
Clinical Protocol Number SCY -078-121 
 
13 March 2024  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 
  • Relative Infant Dose = Infant Dosage (mg/kg/day)/Maternal Dosage (mg/kg/day) multiplied by 
100 
The PK of ibrexafungerp plasma and breastmilk will be assayed using validated LC -MSMS method s. 
Safety:  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed during the study by the collection of adverse events, vital 
signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), physical examinations, and 
clinical laboratory assessments (including biochemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis). For 
each participant, adverse events will be monitored from the time of consent through post study visit.  
Statistical Methods:  
Pharmacokinetics : 
Individual participant  plasma and breast milk concentrations, actual milk and blood sampling times, 
actual volume of milk collected per interval, actual dosing information (actual time and date of 
dosing, and actual dose taken), and PK parameters for individuals and the group will be listed in tabular format. Plasma ibrexafungerp concentrations measured over time will be displayed 
graphically. Plasma ibrexafungerp  concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. The PK parameters of ibrexafungerp  will include  AUC, C
max, Tmax, CL/F, V d, 
and t 1/2. 
Breast milk concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For the PK parameters of ibrexafungerp  in breastmilk: AUC for the different collection periods, C
av based on 
AUC derived from collections at different time points; total milk concentration data will be used to 
calculated  Cmax, Cmin and T max. 
Interim Analysis:  
An interim analysis will be conducted after five subjects have completed their participation in the 
study. The analysis will involve the examination of pharmacokinetic and safety data and will 
comprise a full analysis as described in the SAP. The objective of the interim analysis is to determine 
whether the data from 5 participants is sufficient to addre ss the objectives of the study and fulfil l the 
post marketing requirement (PMR 4069- 2); if not the study shall continue to recruit up to 
10 participants.  
The reporting analysis will involve descriptive statistical methods, including summaries, tabulations, 
graphs, or by- subject listings. Before initiating this analysis, the data for the study endpoints will 
undergo a thorough cleaning process, and the database will be soft -locked.  
Safety : 
All adverse events and other safety evaluations (vital signs and clinical safety laboratory tests) will be 
listed by participant  and tabulated. Summary statistics and plots for safety parameters will be 
generated for the change from baseline values, as deemed clinically appropriate. Adverse events will be coded using the current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activiti es (MedDRA) and 
presented by system organ class and preferred terms.  
Statistical Power:  
There is no formal power calculation. The N is based on practical aspects of recruitment in this 
population. A sample size of up to 10 participants to complete the study is selected, with the intention 
of stopping the study at the interim analysis if the d ata from 5 participants are considered to be 
adequate to meet study objectives.

  7. INTRODUCTION 
7.1. Background  
Vulvovaginal Candidiasis  
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common fungal infection caused by Candida spp. and is a 
significant morbidity condition in women from all social classes.  
Information on the incidence of VVC is incomplete, since the disease is not a reportable entity and data collection is hampered by inaccuracies of diagnosis and the use of non- representative 
study populations ( Sobel, 2007) . VVC affects 70% –75% of women at least once during their 
lives, most frequently young women of childbearing age. Approximately 40% –50% of women 
will experience a recurrence ( Hurley and De Louvois, 1979)  and 5% to 8% of adult women have 
a recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis ( Foxman et al, 1998) . 
Current treatments for VVC include topical antifungals and the use of prescription oral antifungals such a single dose of fluconazole. In two vaginal candidiasis studies conducted with 
fluconazole, the therapeutic cure rate, defined as the resolution of si gns and symptoms of vaginal 
candidiasis along with negative potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) examination and negative culture 
for Candida, was achieved by 55% of participant s receiving single doses of fluconazole 150 mg. 
The therapeutic cure rate is reduced to 40 % in participant s with a history of recurrent vaginitis 
(Pfizer, 2014 and Sobel, 2006) . Although a single dose of fluconazole is able to provide an 
acceptable therapeutic outcome for more than half of the treated individuals, the emergence of fluconazole resistance among C. albicans  isolates and the frequency of cases caused by 
C. glabrata, a strain naturally less susceptible to fluconazole, signals the need for new 
therapeutic approaches.  
Additionally, recurrence of VVC after fluconazole therapy is not uncommon and these 
exacerbations often involve the same microorganism identified in the initial episode, suggesting that a small number of C. albicans  remain as a reservoir in the vagina after completion of azole 
therapy, becoming the source of subsequent exacerbations. This may be explained by the fact that azoles are fungistatic, which means that they slow the growth of, but do not kill, the fungus and azoles are not active against certain s pecies of Candida that cause VVC.  
New curative approaches are needed, particularly involving agents with fungicidal activity (ie, that are able to kill the fungus) and activity against fluconazole -resistant strains, so that the 
causative yeasts can be eradicated. A new therapeutic approach  with these characteristics would 
be expected to result in improved short -term and potentially long- term outcomes for this 
condition. 
Ibrexafungerp is the first of the triterpenoid class of ß- 1,3-D glucan synthase inhibitors. It is a 
semi -synthetic derivative of the natural product enfumafungin with in vitro and in vivo activity 
against Candida species . 
It has the same molecular target as the echinocandins but is structurally distinct and may interact 
differently at the target due to its activity against echinocandin -resistant strains.  
Ibrexafungerp has fungicidal in vitro activity against Candida species similar to that observed with the echinocandins. By way of comparison, the azoles are fungistatic, with colony forming unit ( CFU ) counts that parallel the growth control arm.

  In June 2021 the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved Ibrexafungerp 
(Brexafemme Label, 2021 ) for treatment of Vulvovaginal candidiasis.  
Adult Pharmacokinetics Summary:  After oral, single -dose administration, peak plasma 
ibrexafungerp concentrations occur within approximately 4 to 6 hours post -dose. Plasma 
concentrations declined from C max in an approximately monophasic decline, with a harmonic 
mean terminal half -life (t ½) of ⁓20 hours. The mean AUC 0-∞ and C max appeared, in general, to be 
dose proportional for doses from 10 mg to 1600 mg. Plasma exposures of ibrexafungerp were not 
altered in participant s who were older than 65 years compare d to younger participant s or in 
female compared to male participant s after single oral dose administration.  
Ibrexafungerp elimination is primarily hepatic metabolism; and approximately 1  to 2% of the 
total dose is excreted by the kidney following administration of a single IV dose. 
Approximately 1625 participants  received at least one dose of ibrexafungerp in completed and 
ongoing clinical studies: Phase 1 studies in healthy participants  (n=468), in patients with liver 
impairment (n=16) and in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) (n=16) and Phase 2 and 
3 studies (n= 1125) in patients with either invasive / severe mucocutaneous fungal infections or 
VVC. Ongoing clinical studies include one Phase 1 study evaluating IV liposomal formulation of 
ibrexafungerp in healthy participants , one Phase 1 study in healthy participants  and VVC 
patients, one Phase 2 study in patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), one Phase 3 
study in patients  with fungal diseases refractory or intolerant to standard- of-care (SOC) 
treatment, and one Phase 3 study in patients  with documented C. auris  infection. 
Ibrexafungerp was generally well tolerated following single oral doses of up to 1600 mg and multiple oral doses of up to 800 mg for 28 consecutive days administered as dry filled capsules (DFCs), phosphate compressed tablets (CTs) or citrate CTs in Phase 1  studies. 
Most of the adverse events (AEs) considered related to oral ibrexafungerp across studies were of gastrointestinal (GI) nature and included, but were not limited to, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
nausea, and vomiting. Headache was also a frequently reported treatment -related AE with oral 
dosing. Most treatment -related AEs reported with oral ibrexafungerp were mild to moderate in 
severity. Despite gastric mucosal degeneration findings in rat and dog studies, serum gastrin 
levels and gastric biopsies have not show n clinically significant gastrin level changes or 
histological evidence of mucosal degeneration in healthy volunteers.  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and the Brexafemme
® (ibrexafungerp) label 
(Brexafemme Label, 2021 ) for additional information. 
7.2. Rationale for Trial  
The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether ibrexafungerp is excreted in breast 
milk of lactating women, and if so, to characterize PK in breast milk and plasma; calculate the potential infant exposure if lactating women are treated with ibrexafungerp; and characterize the 
safety and tolerability in lactating women.  Based on 24- hour half -life, it is expected that 
approximately 15% of ibrexafungerp remains after 72 hours, so the collection period of 
0 through 108 hours is considered sufficient to characterize the PK parameters . 
Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common genital infection in women caused by Candida spp., primarily C. albicans  and C.  glabrata. Several studies have reported that 75% of 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.   US IND Number 107,521  
Clinical Protocol Number SCY -078-121 
 
13 March 2024  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 
  women experience at least one episode of VVC during their lifetime and 5  to 10% experience 
recurrent VVC (rVVC) ( Sobel, 2007) . 
Based on FDA Lactation  Study G uidance  (FDA Guidance, 2019) , this drug has expected use in 
women of reproductive age similar to the marketed drugs that are currently commonly used for 
the indication of VVC in reproductive aged women. 
Consequently, evaluation of products for treatment of lactating women  with  VVC is of 
importan ce. 
7.2.1. Benefits and Risks of Breastfeeding  
The benefits of breastfeeding compared to the risks of interruption of breastfeeding, including 
the potential for changes in milk supply and difficulty re -establishing breastfeeding after the 
study will be discussed with the participants. 
7.2.2. Rationale for Interim Analysis  
Given the nature of the study population and practical aspects of conducting a study in lactating 
women, a decision was taken to include an interim analysis to determine whether the data from 5 participants is sufficient to address the objectives of the study and fulfil l the post marketing 
requirement (PMR 4069- 2); if not the study shall continue to recruit up to 10 participants.  
An interim study analysis with full analysis of the PK as described in Section  15.5, and safety 
data collected from these first 5 subjects will be carried out.  
The reporting analysis will involve descriptive statistical methods, including summaries, tabulations, graphs, or by -subject listings. Before initiating this analysis, the data for the study 
endpoints will undergo a thorough cleaning process, and the database will be soft -locked.

  9. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1. Overall Study Design  
Ibrexafungerp is approved in the United States as a single day, two-dose therapy for women with 
vulvovaginal candidiasis. This is a Phase 1study designed to determine whether this dose of 
ibrexafungerp is excreted in breast milk, and if so, to characterize ibrexafungerp PK in the breast 
milk and plasma of lactating women. Up to 10 healthy lactating females who are at least 10 days postpartum with a full milk supply established and are between the ages of 18 and 50 years at the 
time of screening are planned to be enrolled. (Enough participants will be enrolled to complete 
up to 10 evaluable participants .) 
Participants will receive a single day of twice daily (BID) dosing given 12 hours apart (Q12H ) 
oral 300-mg ibrexafungerp. Participants will receive both doses on site. 
Participants will be admitted to the clinic prior to dosing on Day -1, and may be discharged on 
Day 5, after the 108-hour procedures are completed, at the discretion of the investigator. The 
duration of study participation from pre-study through post-study safety monitoring will be approximately 4 to 5 weeks for participants. 
Safety will be monitored with clinical and laboratory evaluations. Breast milk and plasma 
samples will be obtained at selected time points pre -dose and post-dose for determination of 
ibrexafungerp concentrations. 
Participants who discontinue or are discontinued may be replaced at the discretion of the 
investigator and Sponsor to ensure that up to 10 evaluable participants complete the study. An 
interim analysis will be performed after 5 subjects have completed the study . 
Participant s will take ibrexafungerp on Day 1 Q12H with food following the schedule below in  
Table 2.

  9.2. Number of Participant s 
Up to 10 healthy lactating females who are at least 10 days  postpartum with a full milk supply 
established and are between the ages of 18 and 50 years , inclusive, at the time of screening.  
Enough participants will be enrolled to complete up to 10 evaluable participants. 
9.3. Criteria for Study Termination  
The principal investigator, the sponsor, the appropriate regulatory authorities, and the ethics 
committee ( EC) each reserve the right to terminate the study in the interest of participants’ safety 
and welfare. The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time for administrative reasons.  
9.4. Potential Risks and Discomforts  
9.4.1. Potential Risks  
Ibrexafungerp at the one day of 2 X 150- mg dose may cause some side effects. Participants will 
be notified that they may experience none, some , or all of the side effects listed below because 
medicine can affect individual people in different ways. In addition, the study medication may involve risks that are currently unknown. Participants will be asked to tell the study staff immediately if they  experience any side effects while participating in this study, however minor.  
Potentials risks of ibrexafungerp:  
• gastrointestinal ( diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting);  
• elevation in liver enzymes (AST/ALT);  
• hypersensitivity reactions;  
The risks of interruption of breastfeeding:  
• potential for changes in milk supply  
• difficulty re -establishing breastfeeding after the study completion  
9.4.2. Potential Discomforts  
Participants may feel discomfort during some of these tests or may experience some inconveniences. Some may also have risks, which may include:  
• Blood samples: drawing blood from your arm may cause pain, bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely infection 
• Electrocardiogram (ECG): ECG patches may cause a skin reaction such as redness or itching  
• Breast Pump Usage ( Medela, 2022) : Pumping breastmilk shouldn’t hurt, but 
participants may feel discomfort while expressing breastmilk, or get blisters or chafing on their nipple s or breast s. 
− Note: a lactation specialist will be available to answer any participant questions or concerns.

10.1.1. Inclusion Criteria  
A female will be included in the study if she meet s the following inclusion criteria if the 
participant : 
1. is a healthy lactating woman aged 18 to 50 years , inclusive , at Screening.  
2. is at least 10- days postpartum after uncomplicated delivery with a full milk supply 
established. (There is no specific length of time postpartum) . 
3. is actively breastfeeding or expressing breast milk. 
4. is willing to temporarily discontinue breast feeding their infant before the Day 1 morning 
dose through to 108 hours after the first dose (approximately 4.5 days) AND has the 
ability to pump breast milk and to provide a reserve for infant feeding, with acceptance of bottle feeding, prior to the study. 
OR 
has decided to discontinue breastfeeding permanently but has not yet started weaning their infant with acceptance of bottle feeding for the infant. Participants must have an adequate milk supply (if pumping at least 3 to 4 times a day) as milk composition 
changes during the we aning process.  
Note: Care should be taken to ensure that participant s have not discontinued 
breastfeeding an infant in order to participate in the study. 
Note: Alternative infant nutrition (previously stored breastmilk or infant formula) should 
be available for feeding the infant from study Day 1 through 96 hours after the second dose (108 hours  after the first dose ). 
Note: A lactation specialist will be available for participant support during the study. 
5. is willing to fully express breast milk from both breasts during the duration of the milk collection portion of the study. Participant s must be able to express milk from each breast 
at each pumping session using an electric breast pump. 
6. has a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤34 kg/m
2 at the screening visit. BMI is calculated by 
taking the participant ’s weight in kg and dividing by the participant ’s height in meters, 
squared.  
7. is judged to be in good health based on medical history, physical examination, vital sign measurements , and laboratory safety tests (all within laboratory normal ranges or changes 
outside the normal range judged to be clinically non- significant by the investigator) 
performed at the screening visit and prior to administration of the initial dose of study drug. 
8. has no clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at the screening visit.

use (or have their partner use) 2 acceptable methods of contraception starting from 
the time of consent through the post -study visit. Acceptable methods of birth control 
for female participant s are intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, 
contraceptive sponge, and condom. For female participants, oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are not to be used as  contraception as the effect of ibrexafungerp on the 
efficacy of OCP has not yet been established.  
b. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test (β human chorionic gonadotropin [β -hCG]) prior to enrolment (performed by the 
site’s local laboratory).  
10.1.2. Exclusion Criteria  
A female will be excluded from participation in the study if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria if the participant : 
1. is pregnant or unwilling or unable to comply with the lifestyle guidelines presented in the 
protocol during the study period and through the Post -Study visit.  
2. has evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine, 
pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric (including post -natal 
depression), neurologic, allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding 
untreated asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing), or a history of neoplastic disease or any active cancer.  
3. is mentally or legally incapacitated.  
4. has a history of any illness or clinical findings that, in the opinion of the study 
investigator, might confound the results of the study or poses an additional risk to the

13. is unable to abstain from strenuous exercise from the screening visit until administration 
of the initial dose of study drug, throughout the study until the poststudy visit.  
10.2. Participant Withdrawal Criteria  
A participant  may be prematurely withdrawn from the study if they develop a toxicity or 
concurrent illness that, in the investigator’s judgment, precludes further participation in the study for the following reasons:  
• Occurrence of an AE that, in the judgment of the investigator, warrants withdrawal of the participant  from the study drug;  
A participant  may also be permanently withdrawn from the study for any of the following 
reasons:  
• Pregnancy  
• Non-compliance (not completing all required assessments at required times, or 
missing scheduled visits) or protocol violation;  
• Withdrawal of consent and refusal to participate further in the study;  
• Investigator or Sponsor decision that withdrawal is in the participant ’s best interest;  
• Termination of the study by the Sponsor  or health authority;  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.   US IND Number 107,521  
Clinical Protocol Number SCY -078-121 
 
13 March 2024  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 
  • Lost to follow -up; 
• Administrative decision of sponsor. 
If a participant  is to be labeled as lost to follow -up the site is required to make efforts to contact 
the participant  following a missed visit.  
All participants who withdraw from the study will be followed up and d ata collection will 
continue for all available information collected per protocol. 
Participants who discontinue or are discontinued may be replaced at the discretion of the 
investigator and Sponsor to ensure that up to 10 evaluable participants complete the study.

14.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
14.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempora lly associated with the 
use of a study drug/study intervention, whether or not related to the study drug/study 
intervention. 
Any laboratory abnormality that is deemed to be clinically significant in the opinion of the 
investigator will be considered an adverse event and should be recorded in the eCRF, whether or not it is related to study drug. 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.   US IND Number 107,521  
Clinical Protocol Number SCY -078-121 
13 March 2024  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 Stable chronic conditions that are present prior to clinical trial entry and do not worsen are not 
considered adverse events and will be accounted for in the participant ’s medical history.  
The following can be considered AEs:  
• An exacerbation of a pre -existing illness  
• An increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing episodic event or condition  
• A condition detected or diagnosed after the initiation of treatment with study 
medication, even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study 
• Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsen after 
informed consent or following the initiation of treatment with study medication  
The following are not  considered AEs:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Pre-existing disease or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that do 
not worsen  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (eg, hospitalizations for cosmetic surgery or elective surgery or social/convenience admissions)  
14.2.1.1. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, baseline, treatment, or 
follow -up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfils one 
or more of the following:  
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant  or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
All SAEs that occur after any participant  has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, 
through the post -study visit  following the cessation of treatment, whether or not they are related 
to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by SCYNEXIS, Inc.  
14.2.1.2. Other Adverse Event (OAE)  
OAEs will be identified by the Drug Safety Physician and if applicable also by the Clinical Study 
Team Physician during the evaluation of safety data for the Clinical Study Report. Significant adverse events of particular clinical importance, other than SA Es and those AEs leading to 
discontinuation of the participant  from the study, will be classified as OAEs. For each OAE, a 
narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study Report. 
Events of Clinical Interest  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.   US IND Number 107,521  
Clinical Protocol Number SCY -078-121 
13 March 2024  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 The following are considered events of clinical interest (ECIs), and must be reported within 
24 hours of the site becoming aware of the ECI:  
• Overdose  
• ALT or AST > 3 x ULN, confirmed by repeat  
• Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Overdose  
An overdose occurs if a participant  has taken, accidentally or intentionally, any drug 
administered as part of the protocol in a dose exceeding that prescribed by the protocol. An overdose (and any associated AE) is considered an ECI and must be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming  aware of the overdose.  
14.2.2. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the  Brexafemme
® Package Label,  
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) , or is of greater specificity or severity than has been observed with 
the particular study drug being tested. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would 
be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the IB referred only to elevated hepat ic enzymes 
or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected 
(by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator’s brochure listed only cerebral vascular 
accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the 
IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the 
drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
14.2.3. AE and SAE Follow -up 
All AEs and SAEs will be followed to resolution (the participant ’s health has returned to his or 
her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal) or until an outcome is reached, 
stabilization occurs (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of 
the event), or the event is otherw ise explained, regardless of whether the participant is still 
participating in the study. All appropriate therapeutic measures should be undertaken and recorded. Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of the event(s). 
One of the following terms should be used to report the outcome of an event:  
Recovered/Resolved: The event has fully recovered. If the event was a worsening of an 
underlying medical condition, the event is considered recovered when the condition has returned 
to the initial level.  
Not recovered/Not resolved: The event was ongoing at the time of the report. 
14.2.4. Medical Emergencies  
All equipment, supplies, and the properly skilled medical personnel must be accessible for an 
adverse event requiring immediate treatment.  
After a medical emergency has been safely managed, it needs to be reported as soon as possible, 
but within 24- hours to the safety physician, the SCYNEXIS, Inc. medical monitor and any 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.   US IND Number 107,521  
Clinical Protocol Number SCY -078-121 
13 March 2024  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 appropriate reporting done to the ethics committee  and the appropriate regulatory agencies in the 
necessary time frames.  
14.2.5. Protocol Deviations for an Adverse Event  
In the event of an adverse event or medical emergency, allowing departures from the protocol 
will be decided on a case -by-case basis. The Investigator or other physician in attendance in such 
an emergency must contact the SCYNEXIS, Inc. medical monitor, as  soon as possible after the 
medical emergency has been managed, to discuss the circumstances of the emergency. The Investigator, in consultation with the SCYNEXIS, Inc. medical monitor, will decide whether the 
participant  should continue to participate in the study. The Investigator and the SCYNEXIS, Inc. 
medical monitor will document this decision. The Investigator will inform the ethics committee  
of all protocol deviations in accordance with the ethics committee  established procedure. No 
deviations from the protocol of any type will be made without complying with all ethics committee  -established procedures.  
14.2.6. Additional Needed Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Clinical laboratory tests other than those specified in the protocol may be performed to ensure 
the safety of the participants. Those circumstances and data (dates, times, tests and all notes and 
results) will be documented on an eCRF.  
14.2.7. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE (Unrelated, Possibly Related or Probably Related). The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, t here is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product. If no valid reason 
exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.” If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermine d, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”.  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be “possible” or “probable” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
14.2.8. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the participant  and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site. Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse 
need not be reported a s AEs. However, abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to 
discontinuation of administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE. 
Information about AEs will be collected from the time informed consent is obtained up through 
the poststudy visit . Serious Adverse Event information will be collected from time informed 
consent is obtained through the poststudy visit. The AE term should be reported in standard 
medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.   US IND Number 107,521  
Clinical Protocol Number SCY -078-121 
13 March 2024  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious 
outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant  to discontinue the study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section 14.2.1.1. An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on SCYNEXIS, Inc. ’s pregnancy 
form. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an 
investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the participant  was 
discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  
14.2.9. Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be reported as per Appendix B . All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded 
from the time informed consent is obtained through 30- days after the last dose of study 
medication. following the end of treatment exposure. Any SAEs considered possibly or probably related to the investig ational product and discovered by the Investigator at any time after the 
study should be reported. All SAEs must be reported to SCYNEXIS., Inc. within 24- hours  of the 
first awareness of the event. The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents, and email or send a copy by fax to SCYNEXIS, Inc.  as per Appendix B . 
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be emailed or faxed to 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.  as per Appendix B  within one business day of receipt and this should be 
completed on a follow -up SAE form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with 
the appropriate section of the CRF and/or study file. 
The clinical research unit  is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
certain events. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB or IEC of all 
SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, 
drug- related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical trial. Each site is 
responsible for notifying its IRB or IEC of these additional SAEs.

13 March 2024  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 15. STATISTICS  
15.1. Analytical Plan  
All analyses will be conducted in accordance with this study protocol and a Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) and Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLF) shells which will be prepared and approved by the sponsor prior to database lock. The study objectives are in found in Section  8. 
15.2. Sample Size Determination  
There is no formal power calculation. The N is based on practical aspects of recruitment in this this population. A sample size of up to 10 participant s to complete the study is selected.  
15.3. Safety Analyses  
All adverse events and other safety evaluations (vital signs  and clinical safety laboratory tests) 
will be listed by participant  and tabulated for the total number of participant s: 
All Participant s: 
All adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) will be 
summarized by system order class ( SOC ) and preferred term.  
Summary statistics and plots will be generated for other safety parameters, including the absolute 
values and change from baseline values. Some parameter s may need to use log scale. It is 
expected that both the log scale and back -transformed are needed for reporting. No statistical 
testing will be performed for the safety analysis.  
15.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Breast milk will be obtained up to 108 hours post dose and blood samples will be obtained 
starting pre dose the Day 1 morning dose until 108 hours post first dose of study drug for determination of ibrexafungerp concentrations. Sample time points are as follows:  
• Breast Milk:  complete expression of milk from both breasts (using a standard electric breast pump) will be obtained at the following timepoint s and intervals: pre -dose, 0- 2, 
2-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12- 18, 18 -24, 24- 36, 36- 48, 48- 72, and 72- 108 hours post first dose of 
study drug. 
• Plasma samples will be obtained at the following timepoints:  0 hours (prior to first dose), and at 2, 6, 8, 12 (prior to second dose), 24, 36, 48, 72, and 108 hours post first 
dose of study drug for determination of ibrexafungerp in plasma concentrations. The 
12
-hour samples will be taken prior to the second dose of ibrexafungerp.  
The following plasma ibrexafungerp pharmacokinetic parameters: area under the curve (AUC), 
peak plasma concentration (C max), time to peak plasma concentration (T max), plasma clearance or 
apparent oral clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V d), and terminal half -life (t 1/2) 
for ibrexafungerp following oral administration of the VVC dosage regimen for ibrexafungerp 
will be determined for both breast milk and plasma concentrations.  
SCYNEXIS, Inc.   US IND Number 107,521  
Clinical Protocol Number SCY -078-121 
13 March 2024  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 The following PK parameters of ibrexafungerp in breastmilk:  AUC for the different collection 
periods, C av based on AUC derived from collections at different time points; total milk 
concentration data will be used to calculate C max, Cmin and T max. 
The daily infant dosage (total drug present in milk and consumed by the infant per day) will be 
calculated:  
• Daily Infant Dosage (mg/day) = Σ (total drug concentration in each milk collection 
multiplied by the expressed milk volume in each milk collection)  
The M/P will be calculated. M/P = AUC 0-24 milk/AUC 0-24 plasma.  
The calculation of M/P should be based on AUC and on multiple time points over 24 hours and 
not just a single point in time.  
The relative infant dose (the percent of the weight -adjusted maternal dosage consumed in breast 
milk over 24 hours) will be calculated:  
• Relative Infant Dose = Infant Dosage (mg/kg/day)/Maternal Dosage (mg/kg/day) 
multiplied by 100.  
Individual participant plasma and breast milk concentrations, actual breast milk and blood 
sampling dates and times, actual volume of breast milk collected at each time interval, actual 
dosing information (actual time and date of dosing, and actual dose ta ken), and PK parameters 
for individuals and the group will be listed in tabular format. Plasma and breast milk 
concentrations measured over time will be displayed graphically. Plasma and breast milk 
concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
The PK of ibrexafungerp plasma and breastmilk will be assayed using validated LC -MSMS 
methods . 
15.5. Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis will be conducted after five participants have completed their participation in 
the study. The analysis will involve the examination of pharmacokinetic and safety data and will comprise a full analysis as described in the SAP. The objec tive of the interim analysis is to 
determine whether the data from 5 participants is sufficient to address the objectives of the study and fulfi ll the post marketing requirement (PMR 4069- 2); if not the study shall continue to 
recruit up to 10 participants . 
The reporting analysis will involve descriptive statistical methods, including summaries, tabulations, graphs, or by -subject listings. Before initiating this analysis, the data for the study 
endpoints will undergo a thorough cleaning process, and the database will be soft -locked. The 
SAP will be finalized before database lock.  
16. STUDY COMPLETION AND TERMINATION  
Study completion is defined as the date the last participant  completes the final visit in the study.  
Given the unpredictable nature of early Phase 1 studies, it may exceptionally be necessary to keep the study open for gathering/reviewing additional supportive data (preclinical and/or 
clinical) to optimally complete the objective(s) of the study. In this case, the competent authority 
SCYNEXIS, Inc.   US IND Number 107,521

study beyond the last participant  out and the justification for keeping the study open. If 
necessary, appropriate amendments to the protocol will be generated.  
Study termination is defined as a permanent discontinuation of the study due to unanticipated concerns of safety to the study participant s or availability of other new data (pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic, efficacy, biologic, etc.) arising from clinical or preclinical studies with this 
study drug. A study may be paused during review of newly available preclinical/clinical safety, 
pharmaco kinetic, pharmacodynamic, efficacy, or biologic data, or other issues of interest or 
potential concern prior to a final  decision for continuation or termination of the study. 
16.1. Study Termination

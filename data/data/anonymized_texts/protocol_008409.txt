CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis  
Title:  A Randomized, Double Blind Placebo Controlled, First in Human Study to Evaluate the 
Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Single Ascending 
Subcutaneous Doses of AMG 570 in Healthy Subjects  
Study Phase:   1   
Indication:  Systemic Lupus Erythematos us 
Primary Objective:   To assess the safety and tolerability of single subcutaneous (SC) doses of 
AMG 570 in healthy subjects . 
Secondary Objective(s):   
• To characterize the PK of single subcutaneous (SC) doses of AMG  570 in healthy 
subjects . 
• To evaluate the PD effect s (B7RP-1 occupancy and inhibition of B cell survival) of single 
subcutaneous (SC) doses of AMG 570 in healthy subjects . 
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of AMG 570.  
 Exploratory Objective(s):   
• To evaluate  the relationship between PK, B7RP-1 occupancy,  and changes 
in percentage and absolute counts of naïve and memory B cells following single subcutaneous (SC) doses of AMG 570 in healthy subjects . 
• To evaluate the PD effect of single subcutaneous (SC) doses of AMG 570 in healthy 
subjects on serum IgG and IgM. 
Hypotheses:   A single SC dose administration of AMG 570 will achieve an acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile in healthy subjects within the proposed dose ranges   
(SC: 7 to 700 mg AMG 570) . 
Primary Endpoint: Subject incidences of treatment -emergent adverse events , including clinically 
significant changes in physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory safety tests, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) . 
Secondary Endpoint(s):  
• AMG 570 PK parameters (eg,  maximum observed concentration [C
max], time at 
Cmax [tmax,], and area under the concentration- time curve [AUC]) . 
• Anti-AMG 570 binding antibodies . 
• Peripheral blood B7RP-1 receptor occupancy . 
• Peripheral blood changes in percentage and absolute counts  of naïve and memory 
CD19+ B cells (naïve = IgD+CD27-, memory = IgD-CD27+). 
Exploratory Endpoint(s): Exploratory biomarker s may include but are not limited to the 
following:  
• .  
• Serum IgG and IgM.  
Study Design:   This is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double- blind, single ascending dose 
(SAD) study in healthy subjects .  The study consists of 7 SC cohorts.  Subjects will be 
randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive AMG 570 or placebo according ly.

The actual dose to be administered may be adjusted based on safety , tolerability , and preliminary 
PK and PD data of previous dose levels .  Dose adjustment s may involve either an increase or a 
decrease in the planned dose, but will not exceed pharmacokinetic criteria defined in the rationale 
for dose selection Section 2.4.5 . 
Sample Size:    Approximately 56  healthy subjects will be enrolled into 7 cohorts (6 active: 
2 placebo in each cohort).  
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria:  Subject s in this study will be males and females 
between ages of 18 and 65 years , and the females must be of non -reproductive potential.   
Subjects should have a body mass index of ≥ 18.0 and ≤ 30.0 kg/m2.  For a full list of eligibility 
criteria, please refer to Section 4.1 and Section 4.2. 
Investigatio nal Product   
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:   
This first in human study will utilize sentinel dosing for the first two subjects of each cohort.  The 
sentinel pair (the first 2 subjects in each cohort ) will be dosed with one subject receiving a single 
dose of AMG 570 and the other receiving placebo.  The remaining subjects of each cohort may 
be dosed 24 hours after the sentinel pair.  
For subcutaneous dosing in Cohorts 1 & 2, diluent will be used.  For subcutaneous dosing in 
Cohort s 3 to 5, doses will be administered in a 1.0 mL per injection format (up to 3 x 1 mL 
injections depending on treatment arm).  For subcutaneous dosing in Cohort 6, doses will be administered in a 1.5 mL per injection format (4 x 1.5 mL injections).   For su bcutaneous dosing in 
Cohort 7, doses will be administered in a 2 mL per injection format ( 5 x 2.0 mL injections).

CONFIDENTIAL    Subjects will be confined to the research facility from day -1 to day 3, where critical clinical safety 
and study evaluations will be performed including physical examination, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory tests, ECGs, PK, and biomarker sample collections.  
On study day 1, subjects will complete pre- dose assessments and receive a single SC dose of 
AMG  570 or placebo .  Subject s may check out of the research facility on Day 3 after all 
assessments  have been completed.   If needed to facilitate study evaluation at specified time 
points subjects may also stay at the research facility up to Day 11.    After discharge from the 
research facility, s ubjects must return to the research facility on an outpatient basis at s pecified 
time points for collection of blood samples for PK and PD measurements and completion of safety assessments (including blood samples for antibody analysis).  All adverse events, including serious adverse events, and use of concomitant medication will be collected for the duration of the study.   
Subjects ’ participation in the study will conclude with the completion of the end of study 
procedures .  However, if an end of study test result demonstrates a significant clinical or 
laboratory abnormality, the subject will be followed until resolution of the abnormality or until it is considered clinically stable by the Principal Investigator.  If a subject ’s CD3
-CD19+ B cell count s 
are < 107 cells/ µL (the lower limit of normal for  healthy volunteer s), the subject will return for 
further testing of B cell count s every 3 months until the subject has B cell count s ≥ 107 cells/ µL.  
Such f ollow -up visit (s) for B cell counts will continue every 3 months , up to 12 months  after the 
end of study . 
For a full list of s tudy procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to 
Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 8 ).   
Statistical Considerations:  Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected demographics, 
safety, immunogenicity, PK, PD, and biomarker end points.  Descriptive statistics on continuous measurements will include means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  Data will be presented and 
summarized by treatment and may also be presented by time as appropriate.  
The number and percent of subjects reporting any adverse events will be tabulated by system 
organ class and preferred term and may be further classified by severity and relationship to treatment .  Subject incidence of clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical examinations, 
clinical laboratory safety tests, ECGs, and the development of AMG 570 binding antibodies will be 
noted.  For a full description of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section  10.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Disease 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease of unknown 
cause with diverse clinical manifestations that disproportionately affects minorities (in 
particular, blacks and Hispanics) and women of childbearing potential ( Tsokos , 2011 ; 
Rahman and Isenberg, 2008; Kotzin, 1996).  The prevalence of SLE in the United States 
varies widely in different studies but is generally thought to be underestimated due to the 
difficulty in diagnosis of the disease and obtaining reliable data to estimate the true 
numbers of subjects with this disease.  The prevalence of SLE in the population varies 
from 20 to 150 cases per 100,000 ( Pons -Estel, 2010; Helmick, 2008 ; Lawrence, 2008 ; 
Chakravarty,  2007).  There are significant racial differences in prevalence rates with 
164 (white) to 406 (African American) per 100,000 ( Chakravarty, 2007).  In the US, 
one-third of patients diagnosed with lupus have moderate to severe SLE.   
SLE is a heterogeneous disease that is characterized by periods of remission and flares that range from mild to severe.   It is associated with highly variable inter -individual 
symptoms and can be fatal.  SLE can affect the skin (rash), musculoskeletal system 
(arthritis, bone tissue death), nervous system (seizures, psychosis), lungs (pleuritis, pneumonitis), and the blood (venous or arterial clots, anemia).  In addition, 
approximately 65% of patients will develop lupus nephritis, which is an inflammatory

CONFIDENTIAL    condition of the kidney that can range from mild focal to severe diffuse proliferative 
glomerulonephritis ( Adams et al, 2006 ).  Lupus nephritis can also lead to kidney failure 
and is a serious complication of SLE.   
The treatment options and duration of SLE are highly individualized and depend on 
symptom s, organ involvement, and disease severity.   Antimalarial and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are useful in the treatment of mild symptoms such as 
arthralgia and cutaneous manifestations .  Oral corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents are 
used in more severe disease.  Other medications (cyclophosphamide, 
immunosuppressive agents, and tacrolimus ) may be used depending on the severity and 
organ systems involved.  Belimumab  (anti-BAFF)  is a newer agent that is approved for 
patients with mild to moderate disease currently taking standard therapy.  
Although the clinical heterogeneity of SLE presents diagnostic challenges, antibodies to  
nuclear components represent a common manifestation of the disease.  The presence of  
class-switche d immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies implicate immune dysregulation 
as a driving force for disease pathogenesis, with T cells appearing to play a role in the 
development of autoantibody production by B cells .  T cells are believed to be drivers of  
many different autoimmune diseases including SLE and rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) due to 
their central role in the control of immune system function.  Simultaneous blockade of 
the B7- related  protein- 1 (B7RP -1)/ inducible co- stimulator (ICOS) pathway  and 
B cell-activating factor ( BAFF ) with AMG 570 is hypothesized to result in blockade of 
T-cell activation, B -cell maturation, and antibody production. 
2.2 Amgen Investigational Product Background  
2.2.1  Pharmacology  
AMG 570 is a bispecific molecule inhibiting both BAFF and B7RP -1.  AMG 570 contains 
two tandem copies of BAFF- binding peptides identical to the BAFF binding peptides of 
blisibimod (also known as AMG 623) fused to the C- terminus of AMG 557, a fully human 
IgG2 against B7 RP-1 currently in clinical development for SLE.  In terms of anti-BAFF 
effect, AMG 570 has similar binding affinity and cellular potency to blisibimod.  AMG  570 
has 29 pM K D BAFF binding affinity and 0.86 nM IC 50 in a BAFF cellular assay.  
Blisibimod was reported to have an IC 50 of 0.2 nM.  For anti -B7RP-1 effect, AMG 570 
has similar binding affinity and inhibitory activity to AMG 557.  AMG 570 has 28 pM K D  
B7RP-1 binding affinity and 1.36 nM IC 50 in a B7RP -1 cellular assay.  AMG 557 has 
17 pM K D  B7RP-1 binding affinity and AMG 557 parental antibody 16H has 1.35 nM  
IC50 in a B7RP -1 cellular assay.  AMG 570 binds and inhibits cynomolgus monkey

CONFIDENTIAL    BAFF and B7RP -1, but not rodent B7RP -1.  A mouse surrogate BAFF/B7 RP-1 bispecific 
molecule showed dual -target inhibition in vivo and was more efficacious than the single 
B7RP-1 or BAFF inhibitors in the mouse NZB/NZW lupus model.  We hypothesize that 
targeting both BAFF and B7RP -1 by AMG 570 will achieve a large effect size in the 
treatment of SLE.   
2.2.2  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG 570 after a single IV or SC administration was 
characterized in male cynomolgus monkeys.  
PK profiles  of AMG  570 and AMG 557 were similar in cynomolgus  monkeys  (Table  1).

2.4 Rationale  
The interaction of ICOS on T cells with its sole ligand, B7RP -1 on antigen presenting 
cells, including B cells, plays a role in T cell effector functions including cytokine 
production, T cell differentiation, T cell -dependent help for B cell differentiation and 
immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype switching ( Moore et al, 2011 ; Paulos  et al, 2010; Dong  and 
Nurieva, 2003; McAdam  et al, 2001; Coyle  et al, 2000).  ICOS is elevated on T cells in 
patients with SLE, RA and Sjögren’ s syndrome ( Ma et al, 2012 ; Simpson et al, 2010 ; 
Approved  
  

Product:  AMG 570  
Protocol Number:  20140322  
Date:  24 January 2018  Page 20 of 79 
CONFIDENTIAL    Hu et al, 2009 ; Hutloff  et al, 2004).   B7RP -1 is expressed on B cells , dendritic cells  
(DCs) , monocytes and macrophages, and  to a lesser degree on T cells and 
non-l ymphoid cells like endothelial cells,  where it is up- regulated by inflammatory stimuli  
(Kroczek  et al, 2004 ; Groom  et al, 2002 ; Khayyamian et al, 2002; Yoshinaga  et al,  
1999).  
BAFF is mainly expressed by monocytes , neutrophils  and DCs (Chu et al, 2007; 
Rickert  et al, 2011 ).  BAFF supports naïve and transitional B cell survival through binding 
to the BAFF  receptor  expressed on B cells ( Mackay  and Browing, 2002 ).  Increased 
levels of BAFF have been observed in patients with SLE, RA, and Sjögren’s syndrome 
(Mariette et al, 2003; Groom  et al, 2002 ; Cheema et al, 2001, Zhang et al, 2001).  
Elevated levels of BAFF may cause excessive survival signals to autoreactive B cells, 
possibly as they pass through critical tolerance checkpoints while maturing in the spleen and lymphoid tissues .  Indeed, increased dependence on BAFF for autoantigen binding 
B cells was demonstrated in a monoclonal Ig- transgenic model ( Lesley et al, 2004).  At 
target -saturating doses, belimumab has modest efficacy, validating the BAFF pathway  
yet also demonstrating a strong need for therapies with better efficacy.   
The combination of a T cell modulator, AMG 557 (Amgen’s anti -B7RP -1 mAb) , and 
BAFF binding peptides as in the B7RP -1-BAFF bispecific, AMG 570, has the potential 
for better efficacy  than belimumab.  
Dual BAFF and B7RP -1 inhibition is likely to be well -tolerated.  Separate inhibition of 
BAFF or B7RP-1 has moderate impact on the immune system.  BAFF inhibitors 
(belimumab and blisibimod) are well- tolerated in the clinic.  AMG 557 is in early clinical 
development and has an acceptable safety profile to date. 
For proof -of-concept, a mouse surrogate bispecific molecule was generated by fusion of 
two tandem copies of BAFF- binding peptides from AMG 523 to the C -terminus of 
anti-mouse B7RP -1 blocking antibody 1B7 (described by Hu et al, 2009 ).  AMG 523 has 
structure similar to blisibimod with two additional amino acids (Leu, Pro) at the 
N-terminus.  AMG 523 has binding specificity, affinity and cellular potency similar to 
blisibimod.  The surrogate bispecific inhibits mouse BAFF induced B cell proliferation with potency similar to the BAFF peptibody AMG 523.  The surrogate also inhibited mouse B7RP -1-Fc binding to ICOS on mouse T cells with potency similar to anti -mouse 
B7RP -1 antibody 1B7.  The surrogate bispecific PK property was evaluated in mouse.  
Male CD- 1 mice were given single dose intravenous (IV) administration via lateral tail 
vein of surrogate bispecific (5mg/kg), anti- B7RP -1 mAb 1B7 (4.68mg/kg), or anti -BAFF

CONFIDENTIAL    peptibody AMG 523 (1.88mg/kg).  Doses of the bispecific and single parental inhibitors 
were adjusted based on MW to be molar equivalents.  The surrogate bispecific has PK 
properties similar to 1B7 in mouse with no detectable clipping of the BAFF- binding 
peptides .   
To investigate the dual PD effects of the surrogate bispecific, we evaluated the surrogate 
bispecific effect on B cells, memory T cells and antibody responses in the sheep red 
blood cell (SRBC) challenge model.  BALB/c mice (n=5) were immunized with sheep red blood cell (SRBC) on day 0 and boosted on day 28.  Mice were treated with mIgG1  isotype control (5mpk), anti -mouse B7RP -1 antibody 1B7 (5mpk), anti- BAFF 
peptibody AMG 523 (5mpk), combination of 1B7 (5mpk) and AMG 523 (5mpk), or surrogate bispecific (1, 5 or 10 mpk) twice per week for 5 weeks starting on day 0.  Spleen cells were collected on day 35 for FACS analysis and B cell numbers were measured as a PD marker to monitor BAFF inhibition.  AMG 523 treatment led to more than 50% reduction of splenic B cells, whereas no significant B cell reduction was 
observed with anti- B7RP -1 mAb 1B7 treatment or isotype control.  To monitor the 
B7RP -1 inhibitory PD effect, memory T cells (CD4+CD44hiCD62Lo) in spleen were 
measured by FACS analysis.  Splenic memory T cells were significantly reduced in the 
1B7 treated group, but not in the AMG 523 treatment or isotype treatment groups.  Unlike single agent treatment, surrogate bispecific treatment resulted in reduction of both B cells and memory T cells, suggesting dual BAFF and B7RP -1 inhibition.  The dual PD 
effect of the surrogate bispecific was comparable to the combination of anti -BAFF and 
anti-B7RP -1 treatment group.  In addition, and importantly for a bispecific approach, the 
effective doses for B cell vs. memory T cell reduc tion were in a similar range.  
The surrogate bispecific was compared with single agent treatment in the NZB/NZW lupus model, a mouse model of spontaneous disease, in both prophylactic and therapeutic mode.  Surrogate bispecific treatment resulted in B cell redu ction similar to 
that observed with combination or AMG 523 treatment and B7RP -1 occupancy similar to 
combination or 1B7 treatment groups.  Altogether, prophylactic treatment with surrogate bispecific was comparable to combination therapy and more efficacious than single agents in the NZB/NZW lupus model.  
The surrogate bispecific was also compared with single agents in NZB/NZW mice with delayed initiation of treatment starting at 7.5 months of age when mice had developed 
anti-dsDNA IgG.  Similarly, surrogate  bispecific treatment had a modest yet significant 
effect in improving survival, with p=0.0029 compared with isotype control (Kaplan Meier

survival, with p=0.0239 vs isotype control.  No significant difference between other groups was observed.  
2.4.1  AMG 570, AMG 557 and Blisibimod Molecular Structure Information  
The bispecific AMG 570 antibody has a peptide- linker -peptide- linker construct fused to 
the C -terminus of each heavy chain of AMG 557 .  AMG 557 is a human IgG2.  
Blisibimod has a peptide- linker -peptide -linker construct fused to the N -terminus of each 
chain of a human Fc.  The peptides in AMG 570 are BAFF- binding peptides identical to 
those in blisibimod.  Molecular weights of AMG 570, AMG 557 and blisibimod are 
approximately 161, 148 , and 64 kDa, respectively.  
2.4.2  AMG 557 Clinical Background 
Single dose administration of AMG 557 to subjects  with mild, stable SLE with 
subcutaneous (SC) doses of 1.8, 6, 18, 60, 140, and IV dosing o f 210 mg and 18 mg 
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile with no observed neutralizing antibodies (study 20060132).  AMG 557 demonstrated nonlinear pharmacokinetic properties, as 
expected for a therapeutic targeting a cell surface receptor .  The degree  of target 
occupancy was dose/concentration- related, reversible, and achieving maximal levels in 
the 140 mg SC group.  Consistent pharmacodynamic effects on immunophenotype or 
KLH responses were not observed following single doses of AMG 557.   
The estimated mean AMG 557 target occupancy IC
50 was 0. 0888 μg/mL (0. 60 nM), IC 90 
of 0.8 μg/mL (5. 4 nM), and IC 99 of 8.8 μg/mL (59.5  nM). 
2.4.3  Blisibimod Clinical Background 
Subjects with mild to moderate SLE were treated with blisibimod single SC doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0,  or 3.0 mg/kg or IV doses of 1.0, 3.0, or 6.0 mg/k g in a first -in-human study 
(study 20040147) and multiple dose 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 (SC) or 6.0 (IV) mg/kg in phase1b 
(study 20040250) .  Blisibimod treatment led to a significant decrease in naïve B cells 
(IgD
+CD27-) and an increase in class -switched memory B cel ls (IgD-CD27+) (Stohl  et al,  
2015) .  This significant reduction in naïve B -cells was observed when blisibimod 
concentration was 3 μg/mL (47 nM) or higher .  No consistent effects on T cells, NK cells, 
plasmablasts, or plasma cells were evident .  The Phase 2 study of blisibimod in subjects 
with moderate -to-severe SLE ( Furie, 2014) demonstrated significantly higher SLE 
Responder Index  (SRI-5) responses in subjects randomized to the highest dose of 
blisibimod 200 mg once- weekly (QW at Week 20 (p=0.02)).

CONFIDENTIAL    2.4.4  AMG 570 Clinical Background 
AMG  570 is currently being evaluated in this ongoing FIH study in healt hy subjects. As 
of 1 January  2018 , 48 subjects have received a single SC dose of AMG  570 or placebo 
at the following doses: 7, 21, 70, 140, 210, or 420 mg.   All dose levels have 
demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability with no severe, life- threatening, or fatal 
events reported.  A multiple ascending dose study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(study 20150196) has also been initiated with 9 subjects receiving 6 doses of AMG 570 at 70 mg SC q 2 weeks.  Subjects at this dose level have demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability  with no severe, life- threatening, or fatal events reported.  
Preliminary safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics results from the cohorts 
receiving 7- 140 mg of study 20140322, are described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. of the 
Investigator’s Br ochure.    
2.4.5  Rationale for Dose Selection  
The proposed doses for AMG  570 first -in-human (FIH) clinical study were selected 
based on predicted human exposures utilizing clinical PK and pharmacodynamics ( PD) 
human data from AMG  557,as well as  PK, pharmacology, and toxicology data from 
AMG  570, and data from blisibimod clinical studies . 
The exposure margins were computed from serum AMG 570 exposures at the NOAEL 
of 200 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys determined in a 3 month Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology study, and from the projected human PK exposures for the 
proposed doses .  AMG 570 and AMG 557 PK in cynomologus monkeys were 
comparable based on PK studies for AMG 570 and AMG 557, as shown in Table 1 .  The 
projected AMG  570 human PK simulations were initially conducted using mean PK/PD 
parameters derived from modeling AMG 557 phase- 1 data in SLE patients. The PK 
predictions have since been updated based on emerging data from this study  (Table 2 ). 
Given the safety and tolerability of AMG 557 and blisibimod, the established PK/PD relationships, and the NOAEL of 200 mg/kg, the first dose level of this study will be 
7 mg SC, derived from  the US FDA guidance on the maximum recommended starting 
dose (MRSD )(CDER, 2005) .  This dose is expected to demonstrate intermediate 
B7RP -1 occupancy in peripheral blood based on simulated relationship between 
predicted AMG  570 exposure and effective concentration but no reduction in naïve B 
cells or any other biologic effect based on predicted AMG  570 serum level  and 
blisibimod PD data.   Subsequent dose levels are 21, 70, 140, 210 , 420, and 700 mg SC .  
Planned clinical dose levels are also supported by adequate margin based on NOAEL

Observed and/or predicted exposure margins are shown in Table 2  below.

Exposure Margins  
Using the US FDA MRSD guidance for starting doses in healthy volunteers, a safety 
factor of 10, and a NO A
EL of 200 mg/kg  (2400  mg/m2), the human equivalent dose 
would be 4500 mg (2400  mg/m2 = 65 mg/kg for a 70 kg  individual) and MRSD of 
AMG  570 would be 450 mg or 65-times the proposed starting dose of 7 mg.

CONFIDENTIAL    As outlined in Section 6.1 of the Investigator’s Brochure, preliminary assessment of data 
from this study indicates dose- related and reversible receptor occupancy of B7RP -1 
(now referred to as ICOSL in the Investigator’s Brochure).  Preliminary assessment on total circulating B cells indicates a significant reduction in B cell relative to baseline at day 57 in cohorts 2 (21 mg) and 3 (70 mg) compared to the accumulated placebo.  
Preliminary assessment of IgM and IgG levels indicate that relative to baseline, 
AMG  570 has demonstrated no dose- related changes compared to the accumulated 
placebo group.  
Based on the 3 -month GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys and interim 
pharmacokinetics data from this ongoing FIH study, it is anticipated that a 700 mg SC 
dose of AMG 570 in humans would not exceed the exposure associated with the AMG  570 NOAEL in cynomolgus monkeys .  At this highest planned SC dose, the 
exposure margins are 44- and 10- fold below the C
max and AUC at the NOAEL in 
monkeys.  Based on interim pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data from this 
ongoing study, it is also anticipated that a 700 mg SC dose of AMG  570 is expected to 
result in 90% or more B7RP -1 RO at day 8 and B cell depletion of up to  40% compared 
to baseline by day 57.  Significant changes to circulating IgG and IgM levels are not 
anticipated based on interim data. 
In summary, the dose range of 7 mg to 700  mg SC is projected to result in human 
exposures less than the exposures tested in the cynomolgus monkey 3- month GLP 
toxicology study .  This dose range is expected to be well tolerated and to result in 
pharmacological activity useful for dose selection in subsequent clinical trials.  
2.4.6  Rationale for Key Aspects of Study Design 
Healthy volunteers are to be enrolled in this single ascending dose (SAD) study .  The 
understanding of both targets of AMG 570, B7RP -1 and BAFF, and previous experience 
with AM G 557 and blisibimod with their acceptable safety and tolerability profiles justifies 
testing in healthy volunteers .  Further, a single dose of AMG 570 is not expected to 
provide great benefit in subjects with autoimmune disease.   The single ascending dose design requires thorough evaluation of the safety profile for 
dose escalation.  Subjects will be carefully monitored for adverse events and safety 
laboratory results, including peripheral blood B cell numbers and serum IgG .  Testing in 
this population will provide initial information on the PK of AMG 570, which is expected to be similar to AMG 557.

CONFIDENTIAL    Biomarkers include B7RP -1 target occupancy on peripheral blood B cells and 
.  The percentage and absolute counts of 
total lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocyte populations including 
CD3+  T cells, CD16/56+ NK cells and naïve and memory CD19+ B cells 
(naïve = IgD+CD27-; memory =  IgD-CD27+)  will be determined.  The levels of serum IgG 
and IgM immunoglobulins and  will also be measured.  
2.5 Clinical Hypotheses 
A single SC dose administration of AMG 570 will achieve acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile s in healthy subjects within the proposed dose ranges  (7 to 700 mg SC 
AMG 570).  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double- blind, SAD study in healthy subjects. 
The study consists of 7 SC cohorts.  Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive 
AMG 570 or placebo according to  Table 3 .  The overall study design is described by a 
study schema  at the end of the protocol  synopsis section.   The study endpoints are 
defined in Section 10.1.1 . 
3.2 Number of Sites  
Three sites in the US wil l be utilized in this study .  Additional sites may be added at the 
discretion of the medical monitor.   
3.3 Number of Subjects  
Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.   Approximately 
56 healthy subjects will be enrolled into 7 cohorts (6 active: 2 placebo in each cohort). 
See Section 10.2 for the sample size rationale.  
3.4 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who are withdrawn or removed from treatment or the study prior to receiving  
AMG 570 will be replaced at the discretion of the Amgen Medical Monitor and Principal  
Investigator by notifying the unblinded study pharmacist or designee.  The new subject  
will receive the identical treatment as the replaced subject, but will be assigned a 
replacement number associated with this new record.  The unblinded study pharmacist  
or designee will retain the randomization list .

CONFIDENTIAL    3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1  Study Duration for Subjects 
The planned length of  participation in the study will be approximately 5 months  (13 visits)  
which includes up to 6 weeks  for screening , 1 day for drug dosing, 15 weeks for 
evaluation of drug distribution, followed by end of study  (EOS) visit . 
Subject ’s participation in the study will conclude at the completion of the end of s tudy 
procedures.  Once complete, this will conclude the subject’s participation in the study. 
However, if an end of study test result demonstrates a significant clinical or laboratory 
abnormality, the subject will be followed until resolution of the abnorm ality or until it is 
considered clinically stable by the Principal Investigator.  If a subject’s CD3-CD19+ B cell 
count s are  < 107 cells/ µL (the lower  limit of normal for healthy volunteer s 
(Becton,  Dickinson , 2015) ), the subject will return for further testing of B cell count s 
every 3  months until the subject has B cell counts ≥ 107 cells/ µL.  Follow -up visits for 
B cell counts will continue every 3 months, for up to 12 months after the end of study.    
Subject participation may be adjusted based on treatment -emergent data.  All 
adjustments or modifications to the schedule outline above will be agreed upon by the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor.  The Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be informed via written correspondence.  
3.5.2  End of Study  
Primary Completion:  the time when the last subject has completed the EOS  visit as 
outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 8 ). 
End of Trial :  the time when the last subject has completed either the EOS  visit or the 
last safety follow -up visit .  See Section 3.5.1  for details .  
As noted previously, the EOS for each cohort may be prolonged pending 
treatment - emergent data.  
4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (eg, date of screening).

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written i nstitutional review board (IRB) approval of the 
protocol, informed consent form  (ICF) , and all other subject information and/or 
recruitment material, if applicable ( Section 11.2).  All subjects must personally sign and 
date the ICF before commencement of study -specific procedures .  A subjec t is 
considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met all eligibility 
criteria.  
The Investigator is to document the enrollment decision and date, in the subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment eCRF.  
Each subject who ent ers into the screening period for the study , which is the first time 
that a subject undergoes  detailed assessments to determine their potential for eligibility 
into the study, receives a unique subject identification number before any study procedures are performed.  The subject identification number will be assigned manually.  
This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject.  A screen failed subject may be 
rescreened up to two times at the discretion of the PI  with the agreement of the Amgen 
Medical Monitor.  
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if  a subject is 
rescreened.  The identification number will be 11 digits: the first 3 are the protocol 
identifier ( 322), the next 5 digits represent the site number which consists of the 2- digit 
country code (66) and 3- digit study -specific site number (001),  and the last 3 digits are 
assigned in sequential order as subjects are screened (eg, 001, 002, 003, etc.).  Thus, 
the first subject screened at site 66002 would be 32266002001, and the second subject

Date:  24 January 2018  Page 31 of 79 
CONFIDENTIAL    would be 32266002002, and so forth.  This number will not be the same as the 
randomization number assigned for the study.   
5.1 Randomization/Treatment Assignment  
Randomization to AMG 570 or placebo will be based on a randomization schedule 
prepared by Amgen before the start of the study and retained by the unblinded study pharmacist or designee .  On Day 1 , once eligibility for study participation has been 
confirmed (based on data collected during screening visits and on Day -1), eligible 
subjects will be randomized to receive either AMG 570 or  placebo .  The randomi zation 
date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and on the enrollment eCRF.  
Unique randomization numbers will be assigned in sequential order according to when each subject met the eligibility criteria.  At no time will the same randomization number 
be assigned to more than one subject.  
In the event a subject is randomized, but withdraws before receiving study medication, or during the study for reasons other than adverse events ( Section 9.1), a replacement  
subject may be enrolled at the discretion of the Amgen Medical Monitor and Principal Investigator .  The unblinded study pharmacist or designee will be notified.  The new 
subject will receive the identical treatment as the replaced subject but will be assigned a replacement number per the randomization list.  
5.2 Site Personnel Access to Individual Treatment Assignments  
A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the  
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study or may  
potentially impact the safety of subjects currently enrolled or subjects in subsequent cohort s.  Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol  
deviation.  The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Clinical Study 
Manager before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 
1 working day after the event.   
Treatment assignments will be unblinded after the initial database lock  at the end of the 
trial.  After initial database lock and receipt of written authorization from Amgen to 
unblind, the unblinded pharmacist will release the specified unblinded pharmacy records to site staff designated to enter the subject treatment into each subject’s Investigational Product Administration Electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF).

product.  The date, time,  lot number  and volume of investigational product administered 
will be recorded on the individual subject’s electronic case report form (eCRF).   Subject 
will be randomized only once to one of 7 Cohorts starting with Cohort 1 and continuing in 
a sequential manner to Cohort 7.  Within each cohort , subjects will be randomized to 
receive a single SC of AMG 570 or placebo in a ratio of 3:1 .  Once a dose is selected for 
a cohort, no dose adjustments will be made for an individual subject within the cohort.  Each subject will only receive one dose of the investigation product.

CONFIDENTIAL    A sentinel dosing strategy will be used.  The first 2 subjects in each cohort will be 
randomized such that 1 subject receives AMG 570 and 1 subject receives placebo.  This 
sentinel pair will be dosed first and will be observed for at least 24 hours before study 
drug is administered to the remainder of the cohort.  An informal safety review will be 
held after the sentinel subjects of each cohort are dosed and prior to dosing the 
subsequent  6 subjects.   The decision to continue with the cohort as planned will be 
based on available data for vital signs and adverse events occurring in the prior 
24 hours, and will be reviewed by the PI, medical monitor, and GSO or designee.

designee.   Additional members may be added as needed (eg, PK Scientist) .  The DLRM 
voting members will include the investigator(s), Amgen Medical Monitor and Amgen GSO or designee.  
6.2.1.3  Dose-C ohort Study Escalation and Stopping Rules 
Dose- Cohort Study Escalation  
The decision to dose escalate will be based on the review of safety data during the dose level review meeting.  Within each cohort, the safety data will be assessed after all 
8 subjects have been enrolled and at least 6 subjects have completed the day 57 visit.  
Emerging PK and PD data will be reviewed in a blinded fashion at the DLRM as these 
data become available.  Peripheral blood B cell number and serum IgG levels through 
day 57 post -dose for individual cohorts will be incorporated into each DLRM 
assessment.

CONFIDENTIAL    The DLRM voting members will be responsible for dosing decisions, which may include:  
1) escalation to the next planned dose  
2) escalation to an intermediate dose (a dose lower than the next planned dose)  
3) de-escalation to a lower dose 
4) continuation, delay, or termination of dosing  
5) repetition or expansion of a cohort.  
Dose adjustments (if any) will be made on a treatment cohort basis and not on an 
individual basis, and will be agreed upon by Amgen after reviewing emerging safety, PK, 
and/or PD data.  
Dose Stopping and Review  
Further dosing of AMG 570 will be either stopped or modified to a lower dose if suspected adverse drug reactions and/or changes in safety data (including but not limited to vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory result s, or laboratory parameters reflecting 
humoral immune status) are observed and these changes pose a health risk.  A DLRM 
is held when a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) has occurred.  A DLT is defined as any 
treatment -related fatal, life threatening or disabling serious adverse event (SAE) .  In 
addition, any adverse event or change in vital signs, clinical laboratory test value, or ECG which is considered drug related, and poses a significant health risk, as determined by the Investigators and Sponsor, would also constitute a DLT and form the basis for stopping dose escalation in the study .  If a decision is made not to proceed following 
dosing of sentinel subjects, a Dose Level Review Meeting (DLRM) will be held.  In addition, dosing will be stopped or modified  if any of the scenarios shown in Table 4  are 
met. 
Dose Cohort Stopping  Rules 
This section addresses how subject safety will be monitored through adherence to rules 
for stopping dosing within a dose cohort (which precludes any further dose escalation). 
Table 4  describes the dose stopping rules to be used for stopping dosing within a cohort.

Any occ urrence of a CTCAE Grade 2 adverse 
event of the same system class (eg, 
hepatobiliary, cardiovascular) observed in 2  or 
more subjects in the same cohort  Stop dosing additional subjects in the cohort and convene DLRM.  
Review AE and all relevant safety data for 
evidence of relationship to treatment and clinical significance.  Consider unblinding to determine relatedness to investigational product.*  
Upon unanimous decision of the review team, one of the following decisions may be made:  
• Enrollment of the cohort may resume,  
• The cohort may be expanded at the same dose,  
• A lower dose cohort may be added to the 
study,  
• Escalation to the next planned dose may 
occur,  
• Escalation to an intermediate dose (a 
dose lower than the next planned dose) 
may take place.  
Any oc currence of a CTCAE Grade 3 or 
greater  adverse event in a dose cohort  Stop dosing additional subjects in the cohort 
and convene DLRM.  
Review AE and all relevant safety data for 
evidence of relationship to treatment and clinical significance.  Consider unblinding to 
determine relatedness to investigational product.*  
If Grade 3 adverse event is determined to be related to study drug, and clinically significant by the DLRM, no further dose escalation to proceed.  
Otherwise, upon unanimous decision of the review team, one of the following decisions 
may be made:  
• Enrollment of the cohort may resume,  
• The cohort may be expanded at the same dose,   
• A lower dose cohort may be added to the 
study.  
* A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential 
for the further management of the subject, or may impact the safety of subjects currently enrolled, or 
subjects in subsequent cohorts  
Vital Signs Stopping Rules  
If 2 subjects within the same cohort develop persistent out  of range vital sign 
assessments (3 repeated measurements) as specified in Table 5  below in the first 
3 days following dose administration, additional subjects within the cohort (if applicable) 
will not be dosed and a DLRM will be convened.

Humoral Immune Status Stopping Rules  
Humoral immune status will be monitored by peripheral blood B cell counts and total 
serum IgG.  Values of these parameters will affect dosing of AMG 570 by the following 
two conditions:  
1) If any subject exhibits a peripheral blood B cell count < 107 cells/ µl accompanied 
by a serum IgG level < 639 mg/dl ( Agarwal, 2007) at any time during the study, 
further dose escalation will be postponed until B cell counts and IgG levels 
recover without development of infectious complications in these subjects .   
2) If any subject in a dose cohort has a peripheral blood B cell count <  107 cells/ µl 
and a serum IgG level < 639 mg/dl at day 57 post -dose ( Agarwal, 2007), patients 
rather than healthy subjects will be enrolled in subsequent cohorts.  
Infections will be monitored and classified per CTCAE guidelines with stopping rules 
delineated in Table 4 .

Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule 
of Assessments (Table 8) are essential and required for study conduct. 
This section lists the procedure and parameters of each planned study assessment.  
The exact timing of each assessment is listed in the Schedule of Assessments  
(Section 7).  
Whenever vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs , and blood draws are scheduled for the same 
nominal time , the assessment should occur in the following order : ECG s, vital signs, 
blood draws.  The timing of the assessment should allow the blood draw to occur at the exact nominal time.  
The timing and number of planned study assessment s, including: Safety, PK, PD and 
Immunogenicity assessment may be altered during the course of the study based on newly available data (eg,  to obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma concentration) 
to ensure appropriate monitoring. 
The IRB will be informed of any safety issues that require alteration of the safety 
monitoring scheme or amendment of the Informed Consent Form.  
No more than 500 mL of blood, including from any extra assessments that may be required,  will be collected over the duration of the study.  
Additional procedures deemed necessary as part of standard of care or as required by  
local laws and regulations may be performed at the Investigator’s discretion. 
7.2.1  Informed Consent  
Before any study -related screening or baseline procedure can be completed, a subject  
must sign and date the IRB  approved ICF.  
7.2.2  Screening  
After informed consent,  all screening procedures will be performed between Day  -42 and 
Day -1.  Study eligibility must be met per inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to enrollment.  
The following procedures will be completed during the screening period at  time points 
designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  8).

processing, and shipping samples are provided in a separate document from Amgen. 
 
7.2.23  IgG and IgM Blood Collection  
Blood samples will be collected for determination of serum Immunoglobulin IgG and IgM levels at time  points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 8 ).  Instructions for 
collecting, processing, and shipping samples will be provided in a separate document from Amgen.  
7.2.24  Anti-Drug Antibody Testing (ADA)  
Blood samples for antibody testing are to be collected at day 1, 29, 57, and the EOS  
time point  (Schedule of Assessments , Table 8 ) for the measurement of anti -AMG  570 
binding antibodies.  Samples testing positive for binding antibodies may be further 
characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune complexes.  
Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out anti AMG 570 antibodies during the study .  In the event of safety -related concerns, m ore frequent testing (eg,  every 
month) or testing for a longer period of time may be requested.  Follow -up testing is not 
required where it is established that the subject did not receive AMG 570.  
Subjects who test positive for binding antibodies, and have clinical sequelae that are 
considered potentially related to an anti -AMG 570 antibody response may also be asked 
to return for additional follow -up testing.  Refer to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  8), as applicable, for specific time points and the laboratory manual for detailed 
collection and handling instructions. 
7.3 Exploratory Biomarker Samples for Future Use 
Exploratory biomarker blood samples will be collected for serum, plasma and Paxgene 
RNA at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 8 ).  Biomarkers 
are objectively measured and evaluated indicators of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeut ic intervention.  
Biomarker development samples can be useful in developing markers to identify disease subtypes, guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity.

CONFIDENTIAL    Amgen may attempt to develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to 
respond positively or negatively to AMG 570.  
7.4 Pharmacogenetic Sample of Blood for Cell Pellets 
A blood sample will be analyzed for pha rmacogenetic analyses at the time point 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 8 ).  Pharmacogenetic analyses focus 
on inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease activity a nd/or responsiveness to AMG 570.  The goals include the use of genetic 
markers to help in the investigation to identify subjects who may have positive or 
negative response to AMG  570.  No additional samples will be collected for this part of 
the study; however for those subjects who consent to these studies, DNA will be extracted from samples already collected from the exploratory biomarker sample.   
7.5 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessment (Table  8) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.   
This analysis  includes testing to ensure analytical methods produce reliable and valid 
data throughout the course of the study.  The analysis can also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for 
method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is  assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality.   
If informed consent is provided by the subject, Amgen can do additional testing on remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand the 
dose response and/or prediction of response to AMG 570, characterize antibody 
response, and characterize aspec ts of the molecule (eg , mechanism of action/target, 
metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained but are not necessarily reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to 20 years.   
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly nor to alter the 
treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic, biomarker development, or other exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be

third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.  
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
contacting the investigator.  Following the request from the subject, the Investigator is to provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remai ning 
blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are completed.  
However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction will be retained by Amgen.  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the request of the subject through the investigator, at the end o f the stora ge period, or as 
appropriate (eg,  the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product , and has no commercial rights to the data, 
information, discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  
See Section 11.3 for subject confidentiality.  
8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution.  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further protocol -required therapies or procedures, and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal fr om the study.   
8.1.1  Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from investigational 
product and/or other protocol required therapies, protocol procedures, or the study as a whole at any time prior to study completion.

9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Definition of Safety Events  
9.1.1  A dverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events  observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.   
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, 
diabetes, migraine headaches, and gout ) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than expected by the investigator’s assessment .  A pre -existing condition 
that has not worsened more than anticipated ( ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) 
during the study, or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event.   
Approved  
  
Product:  AMG 570  
Protocol  Number:  20140322  
Date:  24 January 2018  Page 54 of 79 
CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject requests to 
withdraw from protocol -required therapies or the study due to an adverse event, refer to 
Section 8.1 for additional instructions on the procedures recommended for safe 
withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or the study.   
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria.  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically  important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility ( eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but  it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug induced liver injury 
(DILI) (see  Appendix  A for DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an 
emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures 
9.2.1  Adverse Events  
9.2.1.1  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do n ot Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after enrollment  through the end of 
study  are reported using the Event CRF.  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved),  
• Severity   
Approved  
  
Product:  AMG 570  
Protocol  Number:  20140322  
Date:  24 January 2018  Page 55 of 79 
CONFIDENTIAL    • Assessment of relatedness to investigational product 
• Action taken.  
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) .  The grading scale used in this study is described in 
Appendix  A.  The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related 
to the investigational produc t.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response 
to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused 
by the investigational product . 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable,  
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event.  
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event CRF.  The 
investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
9.2.1.2  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed consent through EOS are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to 
Amgen .  All serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via fax. 
See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event Worksheet .   
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity/procedur e”?  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversibility.   
Approved

Protocol  Number:  20140322  
Date:  24 January 2018  Page 56 of 79 
CONFIDENTIAL    New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to Amgen.  All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.  The investigator may be asked to provide additional follow up information, which may include a discharge summary or extracts from the medical record.  Information provided about the serious 
adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the Event CRF.   
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.   
To comp ly with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by Amgen before submission to regulatory authorities.  Investigators will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to regulatory 
authorities in accordance with local requirements.   
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good 
clinical practice.  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with 
local procedures and statutes.   
9.2.1.3  Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adver se events following 
the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  However, these serious 
adverse events can be reported to Amgen.  In some countries ( eg, European Union [EU] 
member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are reported, the 
investigator is to report them to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.

If a pregnancy occurs in a female partner of a male subject, while the subject is taking  
protocol -required therapies , report the pregnancy to Amgen as specified below.  
In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
monitor for pregnancies that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapies 
through 20 weeks for the female partner of a male subject.  
The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen’s Global Patient Safety  within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet (Appendix  C).

10.1.3  Covariates and Subgroups 
No subgroup analysis is planned.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
Approximately 56 healthy subjects will be enrolled into 7 cohorts (6 active: 2 placebo in 
each cohort) .  This sample size is based on practical considerations and is typical for 
this type of study .  For safety considerations, for a cohort, with 6 subjects receiving 
AMG  570, there is an 82% chance of at least one subject experiencing an adverse event 
with a true incidence rate of 25% and a 74% chance of at least one subject experiencing an adverse event with 20% true incidence rate.  With a total of 42 subjects expected to 
receive AMG 570 across all 7 cohorts, there is a 34% chance of at least 1 subject 
experiencing an adverse event with a true incidence rate of 1% and the chance of at least 1 subject experiencing an adverse event increases to 88% and 99% with a true 
incidence rate of 5% and 10%, respectively.  
10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Amgen or 
Designees 
Amgen staff and their  designees involved in the study will not be blinded, but will only be 
given treatment assignments when there is a need to use the information for analysis, 
discussion and internal decision making.  
Access to treatment assignments  and other restricted data will be managed as  
described in the Managing Access to Restricted Study Data  Document .  Unblinded 
individuals are to ensure unblinding and potentially unblinding information not be distributed to the investigators or subjects prior to the study being formally unblinded at

CONFIDENTIAL    whether to supply Amgen investigational product(s), and by what mechanism, after 
termination of the study and before it is available commercially.  
12.2 Study Documentation and Archive  
The investigator is to maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she 
has delegated study duties.  All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs will be included on the Amgen Delegation of Authority Form.  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s CRF data are obtained.  These include but are not limited to  hospital records, clinical 
and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence.   
Elements to include:  
• Subject files containing completed CRF, informed consent forms, and subject 
identification list  
• Study files containing the protocol with all amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, 
copies of prestudy documentation, and all correspondence to and from the IRB  and 
Amgen  
• Investigational product -related correspondence including Proof of Receipts (POR), 
Investig ational Product Accountability Record(s), Return of Investigational Product 
for Destruction Form(s), Final Investigational Product Reconciliation Statement, as 
applicable.  
• Non-investigational product(s) and or medical device(s) documentation, as 
applicable. 
In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the CRFs must be 
maintained and be readily available.  
Retention of study documents will be governed by the Clinical Trial Agreement.  
12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection  
The Amgen representative(s) and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, 
upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study ( eg, CRFs and other 
pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Clinical Monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals throughout 
the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The Clinical Monitor is to have access to subject medical records and other study related 
records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs.

CONFIDENTIAL    The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing CRFs, are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global Compliance Auditing function (or 
designees).  Inspection of site facilities ( eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy storage 
areas, laboratories) and review of study related records will occur to evaluate the study 
conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the electronic CRFs must be 
maintained and readily available.  
• Updates to electroni c CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s 
“audit trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution 
and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an Amgen reviewer.  
• The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this electronic data 
capture study.  This signature indicates that the investigator inspected or reviewed 
the data on the CRF, the data queries, and agrees with the content.  
Additional information on the current guidelines for publications can be found at the 
following location: http://www.icmje.org/.  
Amgen (or designee) will perform Self -Evident Corrections (SEC) to obvious data errors  
in the clinical trial database. SECs will be documented in the CRF Standard Instructions  
and the CRF Specific Instructions, both of these will be available through the EDC  
system. Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee)  
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (ie, the same results sent twice with the same  
date with different visit, [eg, week 4 and early termination]) and updating a specific  
response if  the confirming datum is provided in the “other, specify” field (eg, for race,  
reason for ending study).

CONFIDENTIAL    12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The investigator is responsible for complying with the requirements for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unable or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 8 ), the investigator can search publically available 
records (where permitted) to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.   
12.5 Language 
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.   
12.6 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from  this study, the investigator will solicit input and 
assistance from Amgen staff as appropriate.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Jou rnals 
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors), which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.  
• When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research group, alone, does not justify authorship. 
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. 
All publicatio ns (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for corporate review.  The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator, and Amgen will detail the procedures for, and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.

Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments 
Reporting  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL and/or INR elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.3 require 
the following:  
• The event is to be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event ( ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF ( eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver a bnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the Amgen.  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.1.2 . 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies is/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in 
Section 6.3.1  or who experience AST or ALT elevations >  3 x ULN are to undergo a 
period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels.  Assessments that are to be performed durin g this period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve  
• Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies has/have 
been discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic. 
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL:  
− Obtain complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia  
− Obtain serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody (ANA), Anti 
Smooth Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 (LKM1) to assess for autoimmune hepatitis

o Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
o Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivity -type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
o Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
o Concomitant use of medications (including non -prescription medicines and 
herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Obtain viral serologies  
− Obtain CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear 
− Perform appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated  
• Obtain appropriate blood sampling for  pharmacokinetic analysis if this has not 
already been collected  
• Obtain hepatology consult (liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory 
abnormal ities return to baseline or normal.  The “close observation period” is to 
continue for a minimum of 4 weeks after discontinuation of all investigational product(s) and protocol- required therapies.  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as  medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs.

Replace:  
As of 15 January 2017, 32 subjects have received a single SC dose of AMG 570 or 
placebo at the following doses: 7, 21, 70, or 140 mg. Preliminar y safety,

With:  
As of 1 January  2018, 48 subjects have received a single SC dose of AMG  570 or 
placebo at the following doses: 7, 21, 70, 140 mg, 210 mg, or 420 mg.   Preliminary 
safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic results from the cohorts receiving 
7-140 mg of AMG 570 are described in Sections  6.1 and 6.2  of the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  All d ose levels have demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability 
with no severe, life- threatening, or fatal events reported.  A multiple ascending 
dose study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (study 20150196) has also been 
initiated with 9  subjects receiving 6 doses of 70 mg AMG 570 or placebo  
SC q 2 weeks.  Subjects at this dose level have demonstrated acceptable safety 
and tolerability with no severe, life- threatening, or fatal events reported.

Add:  
• Observed AMG 570 Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Exposure Margins for 
210 mg and 420 mg doses  
• Predicted AMG 570 Pharmacokinetic  Parameters and Exposure Margins for 
700 mg dose 
Section:  2.4.5 Rationale for Dose Selection  
Replace:  
Based on the 3 -month GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys and interim 
pharmacokinetics data from this ongoing FIH study, it is anticipated that a 420 mg SC  
dose of AMG 570 in humans would not exceed the exposure associated with the  
AMG  570 NOAEL in cynomolgus monkeys. At this highest planned SC dose, the 
exposure margins are 160- and 48- fold below the Cmax and AUC at the NOAEL in

Based on the 3 -month GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys and interim 
pharmacokinetics data from this ongoing FIH study, it is anticipated that a 700 mg SC 
dose of AMG 570 in humans would not exceed the exposure associated with the 
AMG  570 NOAEL in cynomolgus monkeys.  At this  highest planned SC dose, the 
exposure margins are 44- and 10-fold below the C max and AUC at the NOAEL in 
monkeys.  Based on interim pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data from this 
ongoing study, it is also anticipated that a 700 mg SC dose of AMG 570  is expected to 
result in 90% or more B7RP -1 RO at day 8 and B cell depletion of up to 40% compared 
to baseline by day 57.  Significant changes to circulating IgG and IgM levels are not 
anticipated based on interim data.

Protocol Title:  A Randomized, Double Blind Placebo Controlled, First in Human 
Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and 
Pharmacodynamics of Single Ascending Subcutaneous Doses of AMG 570 in 
Healthy Subjects  
 
Amgen Protocol Number AMG 570 20140322  
Amendment Date:  04 May 2017 
Rationale:  
The protocol has been amended to include an additional cohort – Cohort 6.  Enrollees in 
cohort 6 will receive a single  subcutaneous (SC)  dose of 420 mg AMG 570.  The 
addition of this cohort  will extend enrollment to an additional 8 subj ects for a total of 
48 subjects .  The addition of this cohort will provide additional safety, pharmacokinetics, 
and pharmacodynamics data that will facilitate the understanding of the 
exposure- response relationship to inform future studies with AMG 570.   Available data 
for Cohorts 1 -4 have been used to support updates  to dose selection, study design, 
safety and biostati stical information throughout the protocol .   Where available, observed 
data have replaced predicted values for increased accuracy.  
Additional updates have been made to incorporate clarification and guidance previously released to sites regarding the following:  
• Length of in- house stay – up to 11 days allowed for in- house residence 
• CDC vaccine recommendation – flu season (October -May)  
• Renal disease exclusion criteria – removal of additional criteria does not pose 
safety risk, does not interfere with ability to assess safety of subject, and does 
not affect scientific integrity of study. 
• Screening IgG below 800 mg/dl  – review with Amgen Medical Monitor prior to 
enrollment  
• Delegation of responsibilities to designated physician or nurse practitioner  
• Timing  of consecutively run ECGs –  ECGs should be run in as short a time as 
possible 
• Self-evident correct ions – updated template language  has been  incorporated into 
protocol  
Administrative , typographical  and formatting changes  have been made throughout the 
protocol  where applicable.

Change Summary  Date:  08 January  2016 
Rationale:  
The AMG 570 20140322  protocol is being amended to allow for longer screening period 
so subjects are up to date on their vaccinations prior to screening for the study  
Specifically, the following major changes are being made: 
• Increase of screening window from 28 days to 42 days  to allow required 
vaccination  
• Increase timing for taking triplicate ECG from 30 sec to 60 sec  
• Clarification of contraception language  
Minor typographical errors were corrected and clarifications were made.

Healthy Subjects 
 
Amgen Protocol Number AMG 570 20140322 
 
Change Summary  Date: 27 October 2015 
 
Rationale: The AMG 570 20140322 protocol is being amended in response to FDA concerns for the 
potential of prolonged immune suppression in healthy subjects based on decreases in B 
cells and serum IgG levels observed in the 3-month repeat dose toxicology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys   and inadequate  nonclinical   toxicology studies to support the IV 
route of administration. 
Specifically, the following major changes are being made: 
• Removal of all language pertaining to 210 mg and 420 mg intravenous (IV) 
administration  
• Update to the Serum AMG 570 concentration-time profile  
• Changes to Section 6.2.1.3 to include increasing length of DLRM interval from 28 to 
57 days and addition of Humoral Immune Status Stopping Rules 
• Update to Schedule of Assessments (SOA) pertaining to language about IV dosing 
• Alignment of Endpoints listed in Section 10. 1.1 with other sections of the protocol 
 
Minor typographical errors were corrected and clarifications were made.

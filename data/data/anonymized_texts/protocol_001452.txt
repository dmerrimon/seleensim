Exploratory objectives:  
• To evaluate  the efficacy  of VP-102 by assessing  the proportion  of subjects  exhibiting  reduction of 
≥1 treatable  wart  from  baseline at each scheduled postbaseline visit  
• To evaluate the efficacy of VP -102 by assessing the proportion of subjects who are clear at the  
Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit and remain clear at the Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 and Study  
Day 147 (EOS).  
• To evaluate the efficacy of VP -102 by assessing the change from base line in total wart area (sum  
of individual  warts) at  the scheduled post  baseline visits Day  84, 112 and 147. 
• To evaluate  the efficacy  of VP-102 by assessing  the percent  change  from  baseline  in total wart area 
(sum  of individual warts) at the  scheduled post  baseline visits  Day 84, 112 and 147.  
Methodology:  This is a Phase 2,  double -blind,  placebo -controlled study  to determine  the dose regimen,  
safety,  tolerability, and efficacy  of VP-102 in subjects  with EGW.  
This study is divided into two parts (Part A and Part B). The Schedule of Assessments and Procedures  
is presented in  Table 1 . 
Part  A (dose  regimen  finding)  study  design:  The aim of Part  A is to determine  the two best  treatment  
regimens  for evaluation of safety  and efficacy  in Part  B. 
Treatment regimens will be evaluated based on the requirement to form blisters in most patients, while  
maintaining a favorable safety and tolerability profile (e.g., majority of LSR AEs are mild or moderate  
in severity). Accordingly, increasing durations of skin exposure to study drug (VP -102 or placebo) will  
be evaluated  in three  treatment groups  (n=6/group) that  will enroll  progressively.  
Subjects  will have a Screening  Period  of up to 14 days before  the first treatment,  followed  by a Treatment  
Period  starting  at Treatment  Visit  1 and lasting  through  Treatment  Visit  4. 
Eighteen (18) subjects at up to six sites (additional sites may be added if required to ensure successful  
recruitment  of the study population)  will be enrolled,  into either  the 2-hour (Group  1), 6-hour (Group 2), 
or 24- hour (Group 3) treatment duration of skin exposure groups (n=6 subjects/group). Each group will  
include a minimum of two subjects from each sex and will be randomized 5:1 (VP -102:placebo) within  
each group. All subjects will receive either  VP-102 (containing 0.7%  cantharidin  [w/v]  topical  film-
forming solution) or placebo. Warts are to be treated and then covered (unless prohibited by wart  
location)  with transparent  surgical  tape (e.g., 3M™  Blenderm™  brand)  that will remain  on the skin until 
the designated time for removal. Subjects  will be asked  to remove  the surgical  tape and study drug with 
soap and water  after the pre-determined duration of  skin exposure  for their group.  
Study drug (VP-102 or  placebo)  will be administered  once  every  21 ±4 days for up to four  applications.  
Enrollment will begin in Group 1, then proceed into Group 2, and lastly into Group 3. The enrollment  
of subjects into Groups 2 and 3 will only be allowed upon compl etion of a blinded review of the safety  
and tolerability data by a Safety Review Panel. The Safety Review Panel will be responsible for  
reviewing blinded safety and tolerability data and will provide determinations on trial stopping or  
modification  rules.  A blinded review  of treatment -emergent  adverse events (TEAEs),  focusing on those  
of moderate  or severe  intensity,  will be performed  by the Safety  Review  Panel  before  opening  enrollment

for each subsequent cohort. This review will be conducted after the six subjects in a designated Group  
have  completed the 48-hour (±8 hours)  Visit.  The Safety  Review  Panel  will determine  whether  
enrollment can be initiated into the next Group, OR if more data (e.g., waiting for additional treatments  
for enrolled  subjects or the addition of more  subjects to a group)  are needed  before  making  a 
determination to open enrollment into the next Group (i.e., the review conducted after six subjects have  
completed Group 1 could open enrollment into Group 2 and the review after Group 2 could open  
enrollment  into Group  3). An additional  blinded safety  review of TEAEs,  focusing  on those  of moderate 
or severe  intensity,  will be performed after all six subjects  in Group 3 have  completed  the 48-hour 
(±8 hours)  Visit,  in order  to support  dose selection  for Part B (Safety  and Efficacy).  Safety  Review  Panel  
members  are blinded  to the treatment  assignment.  
Part B (safety and efficacy) study design: Part B of the study will begin enrollment only  after the 
Sponsor has selected the two dose regimens in Part A, which will be called VP -102 Regimen 1 and  
Regimen  2. In addition,  written  notification  from  the Sponsor  must  be provided to the sites prior  to Part B  
enrollment is  to begin. The study will remain  blinded until completion  of both  parts of  the study.  
Approximately 90 subjects  at up to 9 sites (additional  sites may be added  if required  to ensure  successful  
recruitment of the study population) will be enrolled and randomized to one of four treatment arms.  
Randomization will be stratified  by sex so that neither  gender  exceeds ~60%  of any treatment  arm (e.g.,  
placebo group for the 6- hour and 24- hour wash- off cannot have any one gender ≥ 60%). Two of the  
treatment arms will be VP -102 Regimen 1 and VP -102 Regimen 2. The other two treatment arms will  
be placebo  (Placebo  Regimen  1 and Placebo  Regimen  2), with corresponding  durations  of skin exposure  
matching  those  selected  for VP-102 Regimen  1 and Regimen  2. As an example, if the regimens selected  
from  Part A are the 2-hour and 6-hour applications  of VP-102, then VP-102 Regimen  1 would be VP-102 
treatment  for 2-hours  and VP-102 Regimen  2 would be VP-102 treatment  for 6-hours.  Likewise,  Placebo  
Regimen 1 would be placebo treatment for 2 hours and Placebo Regimen 2 would be placebo treatment  
for 6-hours.  Randomization  of the four treatment arms  (VP-102 Regimen  1:VP -102 Regimen  2:Placebo  
Regimen  1:Placebo Regimen 2)  will be 3:3:2:2.  
In both Regimen 1 and Regimen 2, study drug will be administered to EGW once every 21 ±4 days for  
up to four applications.  Subjects  will be asked  to remove  the surgical  tape  and study  drug with soap and 
water  at the designated time selected  from  the dose  regimen findings in  Part A of the study.  
Part A and Part B subject participation: Pre -study screening for eligibility (informed consent, 
demographics, physical exam, vital signs, prior and concomitant medications, and medical history) can  
occur  up to 14 days before,  or on the same  day as Treatment  Visit 1. The dermatologic  exam,  wart count,  
wart measurement (diameter), location of all warts, and photographs (if applicable) must be repeated at  
Treatment Visit 1 if the Screening Visit is not conducted on the same day. Warts must measure ≤ 8 mm  
in diameter each with a total wart area (i.e., all warts combined) ≥ 10 mm2 at baseline. Wart count must  
be ≥ 2 and ≤ 30 total warts  within  the allowed  treatment areas  at the time of  Treatment  Visit 1. 
Subjects who do not continue to meet criteria at Treatment Visit 1 will be considered a screen failure  
and will be treated  at physician  discretion  per standard  of care.  Subjects  who meet  the enrollment criteria  
will be randomized to receive  VP-102 or placebo. Treatment  will continue  with a minimum  of every  
21 ±4 days,  until complete  clearance  or a maximum  of four treatment  sessions.  The exact  treatment

interval  will be  determined by evaluation of the treatment  site and take  any ongoing LSRs  into account.  
Subjects  who achieve complete  clearance of all treatable warts  before  Treatment  Visit  4 will be required  
to return for every scheduled, in- person, treatment  and follow -up visit, whether or not their warts have  
cleared.  The 24-hour,  7-day, and 14-day evaluation  of response  to treatment  (ERT)  telephone  follow -ups 
will be conducted per protocol  for those instances in  which  the subject  was treated.  
Part  A and Part B efficacy  procedures  
All required study activities, including an ERT (i.e., assessment of wart activity [count, location,  
diameter] and related LSRs), will be conducted per protocol. A Blinded Assessor will perform wart  
counts before the ERT assessment at Treatment Visit 2, Treatment Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, End of  
Treatment Visit,  and Follow -up Visit.  
Treatment visits are to take place in order (i.e., Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, and Treatment  
4). All subjects will receive application of study drug to EGW, including an approximate margin of  
healthy surrounding skin, at an interval of every 21 ±4 days until complete clearance of all treatable  
warts,  or a maximum  of four applications.  
No partial  treatment  of warts  (e.g.,  treating  one wart and not another)  is permitted.  In any instance where  
the clinician is uncertain if a residual wart is remaining, treatment should be applied. Instructions for  
application of the study drug are outlined in the Instructions for Use included in the drug shipment, as  
well as included  in the Site  Regulatory Packet.  
Subjects should be re -treated only after 17 to 25 days (i.e., 21 ±4 days) have elapsed since the previous  
treatment and only after any LSRs have resolved sufficiently to allow evaluation of the treatment site.  
Treatment  should only take place  at a visit when  all warts  are evaluable (i.e., not obscured  by an ongoing  
LSR). All warts that are not completely clear should undergo treatment with study drug. Subjects  
exhibiting skin reactions that need additional time, at the Investigator’s discretion, before they can be  
treated again will be evaluated and asked to return for their next treatment visit after the area is  
considered sufficiently resolved to allow for the next treatment (e.g., ongoing dryness or erythema is  
appropriate  to treat).  See instructions below  regarding unscheduled visits.  
Subjects who receive <4 treatments within the treatment period, or have visits that are outside of the  
visit window  due to the duration of  post-treatment  LSRs,  will not be considered  a protocol  deviation. In  
the event  that a subject  misses a  treatment  visit,  and is outside  the 4-day study  window,  they may return 
and be  treated  at the next  available opportunity with the subsequent  visit scheduled  21 ±4 days  after  the 
actual treatment visit. No treatment should be administered after the treatment period without the  
Sponsor’s  approval.  
An ERT assessment will be conducted at  each treatment visit (1 -4; in -person before treatment or via  
follow -up telephone  calls)  at 24 hours  (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), and 14 days (±24  hours)  after each 
treatment  visit (but  not after “unscheduled” visits). Note that  the ERT telephone  calls at 24 hours  
(±6 hours), 7 days (±24  hours)  and 14 days (±24  hours)  are not required  if there  was no treatment  during  
that period. In Part A Treatment Period 1 only, subjects will return to the clinic for an in- person ERT  
assessment  at 48 hours  (±8 hours)  after Treatment  Visit 1. The ERT  includes  questions  related  to removal  
of surgical  tape and study  drug (if applicable)  and collects  any new AEs,  LSRs,  or changes  in

concomitant  medications  since  the last contact.  The subject  will be given  an opportunity  to ask questions  
and review any concerns. In the event that any post -treatment LSR presents a safety concern (including  
but not limited to severe blistering, ulceration, edema, or pain), an “Unscheduled” clinic visit must be  
scheduled and the subject assessed accordingly. In addition, if any post -treatment AEs present a safety  
concern, t he subject may be brought in for an unscheduled visit. The ERT assessments will be recorded  
by a research team member on the ERT form. The ERT visits may not be conducted by a person  
designated  as a Blinded  Assessor.  Phone  calls conducted outside  of the required  study  visits  or required  
ERT assessments should be documented in the subject’s source note but are not required to be entered  
in the electronic data capture system.  
ERT assessments, wart count, and wart location will be conducted before treatment application at all  
Treatment Visits  1 to 4, as well as at the EOT  Visit on Study Day  84 (–0/+8 days)  and at the Follow -up 
Visits on Study Day 112 (±7 days) and Study Day 147 (±7 days). Wart measurement will be conducted  
before  treatment  applicati on at Treatment  Visit 1, as  well as at the  EOT  Visit  on Study Day 84 (-
0/+8 days) and at the Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 (±7 days) and Study Day 147 (±7 days).  
Subjects  who clear  all warts  before  the Study Day 84 (EOT)  Visit  will still be required  to return  for each 
of the scheduled  in-person treatment  visits,  as well  as the Study  Day 84 (EOT)  Visit,  the Study  Day 112 
follow -up visit, and the Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit. A Provider Treatment Questionnaire will be  
completed at the Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit by a clinician who applied treatment to the subject during  
the course of the study. All subjects will continue in the study for two additional Follow -up Visits on  
Study Day 112 and Study  Day 147 (EOS).  
All treatmen t visits  will include  a wart count, performed  before  treatment (if  applicable)  and before  ERT  
assessment. No treatment will be required if the wart is considered clear. Genital warts that develop in  
areas that are unable to be treated, (e.g., close to a mucous membrane) and other wart types (e.g.,  
common  warts)  will not be  evaluated, documented,  or considered  in the analysis.  
Wart counts will be conducted at Screening, Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, Treatment 4, End  
of Treatment  and Follow -up Visits by a trained  member  of the study  team.  Other  than the screening  visit 
and Day 1, wart counts  will also be conducted by a member  of the research  team  that has been  identified  
and trained  as a Blinded Assessor.  The Blinded  Assessor  may be utilized  for a subject’s initial screening,  
enrollment and treatment Visit 1 activities, however, may not perform any other study related activities  
other than wart counts at subsequent visits (e.g., follow -up phone calls or unscheduled visits) for the  
same subject.  The Blinded Assessor  is not  required to be the same person  for each assessment.  
It can sometimes  be challenging to determine  if a wart is completely  clear  after treatment  due to ongoing 
LSRs. At any visit in which the Investigator is unable to eva luate or treat some warts due to ongoing  
LSRs,  an “Unscheduled” visit should be documented.  The timing  of the next visit  will be determined  by 
the resolution  of the LSR.  The research  team  should be in contact  with the patient  until LSRs  are resolved  
sufficiently  and a treatment visit can be scheduled  within  21 ±4 days when possible.  Specific  instructions  
on how to conduct  the initial  wart count  and measure wart diameter  will be provided during Investigator  
training.  
At designated  sites,  photography will be offered  to volunteer  subjects  who  consent to participate.

Part A  and Part  B safety  procedures  
Subjects  will be provided with take home  instructions  describing  what  they might  expect  throughout  the 
course  of the study, as well  as recommendations  for wound care  (if needed), when  it is important  to call 
their doctor, and instructions for who to contact in an emergency. In the event that any post -treatment  
LSR presents  a safety  concern  (including but not limited  to severe blistering, ulceration, edema,  or pain), 
an “Unscheduled”  clinic  visit must  be scheduled  and the subject  assessed  accordingly.  In addition,  if any 
post-treatment AEs  present  a safety  concern,  the subject  may  be brought in  for an unscheduled visit.  
An LSR guide for subjects, with specific photographs representing the various skin reactions and  
examples  of intensity, will be provided and reviewed in detail at the clinic with the subject by the  
research team. The LSR guide will be utilized for reference by the subject during the ERT follow -up 
telephone assessments with the research team member. The final determination of LSR parameters,  
including intensity, will be  made by the research  team  member.  
Subject Participation: Pre -study screening for eligibility (informed consent, demographics, physical  
exam, vital signs, prior and concomitant medications, and medical history) can occur up to 14 days  
before,  or on the same  day as Treatment  Visit  1. The dermatologic  exam,  wart  count, wart measurement  
(diameter), location of all warts, and photographs (if applicable) must be repeated at Treatment Visit 1  
if the Screening Visit is not conducted on the same day. Warts must measure ≤ 8 mm in diameter each  
with a total wart area (i.e., all warts combined) ≥ 10 mm2 at baseline. Wart count must be ≥ 2 and ≤ 30  
total warts within  the allowed tre atment  areas  at the time of Treatment  Visit 1.  
Subjects who do not continue to meet criteria at Treatment Visit 1 will be considered a screen failure  
and will be treated  at physician  discretion  per standard  of care.  Subjects  who meet  the enrollment  criteria  
will be randomized  to receive VP-102 or placebo. Treatment  will continue  with a minimum  of every  
21 ±4 days, until complete clearance or a maximum of four treatment sessions. The exact treatment  
interval  will be  determined by evaluation of the treatment  site and take  any ongoing LSRs  into account.  
Subjects  who achieve complete  clearance of all treatable  warts  before  Treatment  Visit  4 will be required  
to return for every scheduled, in- person, treatment and follow -up visit, whether or not their warts have  
cleared. The 24 -hour, 7- day, and 14- day ERT telephone follow -ups will be conducted per protocol for  
those  instances in which the subject  was treated.

Name  of finished  product:  VP-102 
Name(s)  of active  ingredient(s):  Cantharidin  
Test Product,  Dose,  and Mode  of Administration:  Study drug (VP-102 or placebo)  is contained  within  
a single -use applicator. Study drug will be applied in sufficient quantity to cover the entirety of each  
wart including approximately a 1 mm margin of surrounding, healthy skin. The  VP-102 single -use 
applicator  contains 0.45 mL of 0.7% w/v  cantharidin,  (Lot # 108107172).  
The placebo single -use applicator contains the same formulation as the VP -102 applicator but does not  
contain the active  pharmaceutical  ingredient  cantharidin  (Lot # 108207171.)  
Duration of Treatment: Study duration from Treatment Visit 1 through the final follow -up visit is  
approximately  147 days  (21 weeks).  The length  of study  participation  is approximately 84 (–0/+8)  days 
for the EOT assessment ( primary endpoint) and Study Day 147 (±7 days) to complete the study, in  
addition to the screening visit of up to 14 days before study drug administration. The study will consist  
of up to four applications of study drug at intervals of 21 ±4 days. All treat ments will take place within  
a 75- day period. No treatment should be administered after Day 75 without the Sponsor’s approval.  
Post-treatment Follow -up Visits on Study Day 84 ( –0/+8 days) (EOT), Study Day 112 (±7 days),), and  
Study Day 147 (±7 days) are included for subjects to evaluate the durability of treatment response over  
time.  
Criteria for Evaluation  
Primary  efficacy  endpoint:  
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting complete clearance of all treatable warts at the Study Day 84  
(EOT)  Visit 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints:  
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting complete clearance of all treatable warts (baseline and new) at  
Treatment Visit 2, Treatment Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, and Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 
and Study Day 147 (EOS)  
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting 90% and 75% clearance of all treatable warts (baseline and new)  
at Treatment Visit 2, Treatment Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, Study Day 84 (EOT), and Follow -up 
Visits on  Study Day 112 and Study Day 147 (EOS)  
• Change from base line in the number of treatable warts (baseline and new) at Treatment Visit 2,  
Treatment  Visit  3, Treatment  Visit  4, Study Day 84 (EOT),  and Follow -up Visits  on Study Day 112 
and Study Day 147 (EOS)  
• Change from baseline in the percent of treatable warts (baseline and new) at Treatment Visit 2,  
Treatment Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, at Study Day 84 (EOT), and Follow -up Visits on Study Day  
112 and Study  Day 147 (EOS)

Exploratory  efficacy  endpoints:  
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting reduction of  ≥ 1 treatable wart  from  baseline  at Treatment  Visit  2, 
Treatment  Visit  3, Treatment  Visit 4, Study Day 84 (EOT),  and Follow -up Visits  on Study Day 112 
and Study Day 147 (EOS)  
• Proportion  of subjects who are clear  at the Study  Day 84 (EOT)  Visit  and remain  clear  at the Follow - 
up Visits  on Study Day 112 and Study Day 147 (EOS)  
• Change  from  baseline in total wart area (sum  of individual  warts)  at Study  Day 84 (EOT),  and 
Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 and Study Day 147 (EOS)  
• Change  from  baseline  in the percent  of total wart area (sum  of individual  warts)  at Study  Day 84 
(EOT),  and Follow -up Visits on Study  Day 112 and Study  Day 147 (EOS)  
 
Safety  endpoints:  
Safety analyses will include AEs, LSRs, medical history (including previous HPV immunization),  
physical  examinations, vital  signs,  and concomitant  medication use  
• The incidence of  AEs  will be assessed  throughout  the study;  AEs  will include  all LSRs,  whether  or 
not they  are expected or  related  to study  drug mechanism  of action.  
• LSRs of all previously treated areas will be assessed at each treatment visit using the protocol  
specific ERT  form  
• Limited physical examinations will be completed before the first treatment and at the Study Day  
147 (EOS) Visit; additional physical examinations will be performed when clinically warranted  
(e.g.,  subject  reports  symptoms classified  as an  AE requiring further  evaluation)  
• Vital signs (temperature and heart rate) will be obtained before the treatment is applied at each  
treatment  visit  and at  the start  of the Study  Day 84 (EOT)  Visit  
• Concomitant medication  use will be  collected  at each  study visit and ERT telephone contact  
Statistical  Methods:  
Although no formal  power  calculations  have  been  performed, it is expected  that a sample  size of 
18 subjects in Part A and 90 subjects in Part B, evaluable at the Study Day 84 ( –0/+8 days) EOT Visit,  
will be informative regarding wart clearance rates that can support assumptions in subsequent placebo - 
controlled  trials.  
Analysis  populations:  
• The Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Population will  include  all randomized subjects  
• The Safety Population will include all randomized subjects who receive ≥ 1 application of study  
drug (VP-102 or placebo)

• The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all subjects who receive all planned treatments of  
study drug (e.g., complete  up to four treatments  within  the Day 75 treatment  window  or clear  before  
Day 75), had no major protocol violations, and were assessed for clearance at the Study Day 84  (-
0/+8 days)  EOT Visit  
Summaries  of data from  subjects enrolled  in Part A will be pooled with corresponding subjects  in Part B. 
For instance, if one of the two regimens selected for Part B is the 6 -hour application of VP -102, then  
results from subjects who received the 6 -hour application of VP -102 from Part A will be pooled with  
results from  subjects who  received  the 6- hour application of  VP-102 from  Part B. 
An additional set of tables will be generated t hat summarize subjects from Part A of the study who are 
not used in Part B of the study. Summary statistics for continuous variables and counts and percentages  
for categorial variables will be shown by treatment. However, due to the limited number of subje cts for  
this set of tables  (expected  n=6), analyses  to be carried  out will  only be descriptive in  nature. 
Subject demographics, efficacy tables, and subject dropout rates will be tabulated at the Study Day 84  
(EOT) Visit and Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit. Data  will be summarized using descriptive statistics  
(sample size, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and  
frequencies, and percentages for discrete variables. Corresponding by- subject data listings will be  
tabulated.  
Efficacy will be evaluated in the ITT and PP Population by treatment group. At the end of the study,  
tables will be generated that pool subjects from Part A and Part B for VP -102 Regimen 1, VP -102 
Regimen  2, Placebo  Regimen  1, and Placebo  Regimen  2. For  the efficacy  endpoints,  summary  statistics  
for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables will be presented. In  
addition, statistical  comparisons will be carried  out to compare  VP-102 Regimen  1 to Placebo  Regimen  
1 and VP -102 Regimen 2 to Placebo Regimen 2. Comparisons made within Regimen 1 (VP -102 vs  
Placebo) will be independent of comparisons made within Regimen 2. Comparisons may be carried  
across Regimens; however, no formal statistical testing will be carried out with com parisons being  
considered  only observational.  
An additional set of tables will be generated that summarize subjects from Part A of the study who do  
not participate in Part B of the study. Summary statistics for continuous variables and counts and  
percentag es for categorial  variables will be  shown by  treatment.  However,  due to the limited  number  of 
subjects  for this set of tables  (expected  n=6),  analyses  to be carried  out will only be descriptive  in nature. 
Safety analyses will be conducted in the Safety Population by actual treatment received. AEs, including 
LSRs, will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Version 20.0. 
The number and percentage of subjects having TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class and  
MedDRA preferred term with a breakdown by treatment group. A subject -by-subject AEs data listing,  
including  verbatim  term,  preferred  term,  treatment,  severity,  location, and causal  relationship  to the study  
drug will be provided. The number of subjects experiencing TEAEs and number of TEAEs will be  
summarized  by treatment  using frequency counts.

Footnotes  to Table 1  
a. Screening can occur up to 14 days before study drug application on Treatment Visit 1 (Day 1) or on the same day as Treatment Visit 1. If treatment is not applied on the same  
day as screening,  repeat  the assessments and procedures  of subject  eligibility,  medical  history,  genital wart history,  vital signs,  wart assessments  (wart  count,  wart measurement  
[diameter and area], location of all warts), dermatologic exam, photography (if applicable), and prior medication use at Treatment Visit 1 before study drug application. An  
IRB- approved ICF  must  be signed before any  study  specific  procedures  are performed.  
b. The ERT telephone calls should be conducted based on the time of study drug application. The ERT telephone calls at 24 hours (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), and 14 days  
(±24  hours)  after each treatment visit are not required  if there  was no treatment  during that treatment  period.  The ERT  telephone  call at 24  hours  (±6 hours),  7 days (±24  hours),  
and 14 days (±24 hours) after  each treatment  will only collect information since the last contact.  
c. All treatments may be administered over the course of up to 75 days. Provider questionnaire to be completed at the Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit by a clinician who applied  
treatment  to the subject  during the course of  the study.  
d. In the event that any post -treatment LSR AE presents a safety concern (including but not limited to severe blistering, ulceration, edema, or pain), an “Unscheduled” clinic visit  
must  be scheduled  and the subject  assessed  accordingly.  In addition,  if any post-treatment AEs  present  a safety  concern,  the subject  may be brought  in for an unscheduled  visit.  
“Unscheduled”  visits  should also be used for visits  in which treatment  is unable to be applied to all warts  due to ongoing LSRs.  
e. Subjects  are to be scheduled  in 21 (±4)-day intervals  after each treatment.  The next treatment  visit is to be scheduled  21 (±4) days after the last treatment,  but only after any LSR 
has resolved sufficiently to allow evaluation of the treatment site. The research team should be in contact with the patient until LSRs are resolved and a treatment visit can be 
scheduled  within  21 days (±4) when  possible.  
f. Subjects will return for additional Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 (±7 days) and Study Day 147 (±7 days) (EOS) for an assessment of warts to determine the durability of 
previous responses and/or LSRs. Subjects are to attend all planned in- person visits,  whether they have achieved complete clearance before or at the Study Day 84 ( –0/+8 days)  
EOT  assessment.  
g. Demographics:  date of birth,  sex, race,  and ethnicity  will be collected.  
h. Vital signs  (e.g., temperature,  heart  rate) will be obtained at  each treatment visit before  application  of study  drug.  
i. Additional  limited  physical  examination,  symptom,  or AE-directed  physical  examination may  be performed  if warranted  (see Source/eCRF  for a more  detailed  description)  
j. Dermatologic exam (including Fitzpatrick Skin Type at Screening only) and location of each wart is specified by anatomical location. Wart count, location,  and measurements  
(diameter) should be recorded at Treatment Visit 1, before treatment, to confirm that the subject meets inclusion  criteria of ≥ 2 to ≤ 30 warts and that the warts are ≤ 8 mm in  
diameter  each with a total wart area (i.e., all warts  combined)  ≥ 10 mm2. Wart  area should  be calculated  at Screening/Treatment  1, End of Treatment,  and Follow -up Visits  using  
the formula  “area= πr2”, where r= radius  of wart.  Warts that develop  in areas  that are unable  to be treated,  (e.g.,  close  to a mucous  membrane)  will not be evaluated,  documented,  
or considered in the analysis. Wart counts will be conducted at Screening, Treatm ent 1, Treatment 2, Treatment 3, Treatment 4, End of Treatment, and Follow -up Visits by a  
trained member of the study team. Other than the screening visit and Day 1, wart counts will also be conducted by a designate d Blinded Assessor. Wart counts completed at  
Treatment  Visit 2, Treatment  Visit 3, and Treatment  Visit 4; and Follow -up Visits  on Study  Day 84 (–0/+8 days)  (EOT);  Study Day 112 (±7 days),  and Study  Day 147 (±7 days)  
(EOS) should be performed  before  the dermatologic  exam  and ERT  assessments  and will be obtained  by a Blinded  Assessor.  The Blinded  Assessor  does not have  to be the same  
person at each visit.  Blinded  assessors must  be trained  to the study,  complete  Good  Clinical Practices,  and be listed  on the FDA  FORM  1572 and the site Delegation  of Authority  
Log. A  separate wart count  including  wart measurement, wart  location,  and dermatologic  examination  are conducted  by a study team  member who  is not considered,  or has not 
acted as, the Blinded  Assessor  for the subject  throughout  the subject’s  participation

k. Pregnancy test is to be performed before study drug application at each treatment visit (1 -4) and at  Follow -up Visits  on Study Day 84  (–0/+8 days)  (EOT), Study Day 112  
(±7 days), and Study Day 147 (±7 days)  (EOS) in any females  of childbearing  potential  (i.e., females  who are capable  of menstruating).  
l. Subjects who agree to participate in the photographic portion of the study will have photographs of warts taken before each treatment by the study team. If there are no warts  
remaining, the same areas will be photographed and repeated at the Follow -up Visits on Study Day 84 ( –0/+8 days) (EOT) and Study Day 147 (±7 days) (EOS) regardless of  
whether  warts  are present.  These  images  may be used on handouts  in future  trials,  for training  purposes,  or future  marketing  materials.  Photographs  will be de-identified  to those  
outside  the research  team  and stored in  a HIPAA compliant  manner. Efforts will  be made to ensure  that no photographs  with identifiable  features  are obtained.  
m. Application of study  drug and surgical  tape must  be conducted by a study  team  member  who is not considered,  or has not acted  as, the Blinded  Assessor  for the subject  throughout  
the subject’s participation. Surgical tape should only be removed at the designated removal time, when the treatment site is washed and study drug removed. Surgical tape and  
study drug may be gently removed from individual warts before the designated removal time in the event of significant blistering, significant pain, or treatment -emergent AEs.  
The surgical tape and study drug should not be removed from the remaining unproblematic warts until  the designated removal time is reached. Removal of the surgical tape  
should be aided by soap and water, which will also help to prevent unroofing the blisters. Subjects who remove study drug bef ore the assigned time frame will be considered a  
protocol  deviation  unless  early  removal  is due to protocol  defined  criteria.  Early  removal  is defined  as removal  of study  drug outside  of the following  windows:  ±1-hour window  
for the 2-hour duration  of skin exposure  group;  ±2-hour window  for the 6-hour duration  of skin exposure  group,  and ±6-hour window  for the 24-hour duration  of skin exposure  
group.  
n. In both Part A and Part B, an in-person  follow -up ERT  assessment  will be conducted  at each treatment  visit (1-4) before  study drug application  and at Follow -up Visits  on Study 
Day 84 ( –0/+8 days) (EOT), Study Day 112 (±7 days), and Study Day 147 (±7 days) (EOS). In addition, for Part A Treatment Period 1 only, an in -person follow -up ERT  
assessment will be conducted  at 48  hours (±8 hours). Follow -up tele phone assessments for ERT will be conducted at 24 hours  (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), and 14 days  
(±24 hours) after each treatment visit (1 -4) in which study drug is applied. Assessments will be recorded by the research team member on the ERT form. All E RT safety  
assessments must be conducted by a qualified member of the research team. ERT assessments and telephone calls must be conduct ed by a study team member who is not  
considered,  or has  not acted  as, the Blinded  Assessor  for the  subject  throughout  the subject’s  participation.  
o. Subjects will be provided with take -home instructions describing how to remove the surgical tape, the possible LSR’s, and what to expect over the next 24 hours t o several  
months.  A 24-hour emergency  number  will also be provided.  The next visit date/calls  and time will be indicated  on the form.  An LSR Guide  for subjects  will be reviewed  at the 
clinic with the subject by the research team, with copies provided for home use in the required post -treatment ERT follow -up telephone calls. Both take home instructions and  
LSR Guide  will be provided and reviewed after  each treatment  to ensure  understanding and confirm  the education materials  are available.

 4.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
4.1 Introduction  
 
4.1.1 Genital Warts  
 
Genital  warts  (also  known as anogenital  warts  or condyloma  acuminatum)  is a sexually  
transmitted viral disease caused by multiple different types of the human papilloma  
virus (HPV).[1] Human papilloma virus is spread through direct skin- to-skin contact,  
usually during oral, genital, or anal sex with an infected partner.[2] Human papilloma  
virus affects the epidermis, vulva, vagina, cervix, and rectum. Diagnosis of genital  
warts  is usual ly made by visual  inspection and can be confirmed  by biopsy.[3] The four 
morphologic types of genital warts are cauliflower -shaped, smooth papular, keratotic,  
and flat. Genital  warts  cause  few symptoms  but can occasionally  be painful. Conditions  
known to predispose  women  to infection  with HPV  include  local  trauma,  diabetes,  and 
immuno -suppression.[1] 
 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in  
the United States.[4] Approximately 1% of people in the United States have ge nital 
warts.[5] Risk factors for genital warts include multiple sex partners, early onset of  
sexual activity, long- term oral contraceptive use in women and previous history of  
other sexually transmitted diseases  (e.g., chlamydia,  gonorrhea,  genital  herpes or 
trichomoniasis, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes).[6] 
 
Safe and effective  HPV vaccines  are available for adolescents  and young adults,  but do 
not protect against all HPV types that can cause genital warts[5] Abstinence is the only  
completely  effective way  of avoiding genital warts.  
 
4.1.2 Approved  Treatments  
 
The goal of treatment is to eliminate lesions. Most treatments for warts focus on  
destruction of the lesion through electrocautery, chem ical burning, cryotherapy, or  
immune  mediators.[1] Currently  available  treatments  for genital  warts  include  
podophyllin, imiquimod, sinecatechins, and procedural therapies such as cryotherapy, 
trichloroacetic acid (TCA), laser, surgical, and electrocautery). A recently published 
clinical study explored the efficacy of topical compounded cantharidin compared to TCA  (Section  4.4.3).
[1] No single  treatment  is ideal  for all patients  and all warts.

 Treatment of anogenital warts is guided by wart size, number, anatomic site, patient  
preference;  convenience;  and provider  experience.  In addition, each of these treatments  
have shortcomings related to multiple applications, erosions and erythema, adverse  
effects,  long times  for resolution, and expense.[1] Because  of these shortcomings, some  
clinicians  have  employed combination therapy  (e.g., provider -administered  
cryotherapy with patient -applied topical therapy between visits to the provider).[3] 
However, limited data has been published on the safety and efficacy of combination  
therapies.[3] 
 
4.1.3 Cantharidin  
 
For many dermatologists, 0.7% w/v cantharidin has been the treatment of choice for  
common warts  and molluscum  contagiosum  (MC) for decades.[7]. However,  
cantharidin remains an unapproved drug and there is no reliable or controlled source  
on the market.  
 
Cantharidin (1,2- dimethyl- 3,6-epoxyperhydrophthalic  anhydride)  is a lipophilic  
natural compound that can be isolated from the body fluids of the blister beetle, 
primar ily of the family Meloidae. The Mylabris species of beetle contains a much  
greater  concentration of cantharidin  than other  species  and is the primary  type of beetle 
used in modern cantharidin preparations. 
 
In contrast  to currently  available  therapies,  cantharidin functions  as a vesicant,  
weakening desmosomes in the epidermis when applied topically via a liquid film - 
forming formulation. Application to the skin causes the activation of neutral serine  
proteases  resulting in the destruction of int ercellular desmosomes responsible for  
holding the layers  of the skin together.[8] Intracellular  tonofilaments  are also weakened,  
the result being a fluid -filled, thin -walled, epidermal vesicle. The superficial nature of  
the blisters is attributed to cantha ridin’s lesser effect on hemidesmosomes in the basal  
layer  compared  to the more  superficial  desmosomes. This process  is not associated  with 
scarring, as the underlying dermal layer of skin is undamaged. Cantharidin has no 
known direct antiviral effects. Cantharidin application also can stimulate an immune  
response in the skin that can cause local inflammation, which may be a contributing  
factor  in treating  viral skin disease.[9]

VP-102, a 0.7% w/v topical film -forming cantharidin formulation has been developed  
to be consistent  with  the predominant  concentration  of cantharidin  used  by physicians. 
VP-102 is administered with a single -use applicator to minimize cross -contamination  
and concentration changes during use. Each VP -102 applicator contains 0.45 mL of  
drug product. Gentian  violet,  a dye common in surgical  markers,  has also been  included  
to facilitate  physician recognition of  treated  versus  untreated  lesions. Finally, to  afford  
additional safety and deter potent ial oral ingestion of the drug, the oral deterrent  
denatonium  benzoate has  been included.  
 
4.2 Nonclinical Studies  
 
Cantharidin is a potent  inhibitor  of protein phosphatases  that are found in all tissues.[10] 
The inhibition  of these  phosphatases  may be involved in cantharidin’s  systemic  
manifestations  when  delivered  orally  or via injection  (Section  6.1.1 of the 
Investigator’s Brochure [IB]). The available nonclinical studies to assess the potential  
for untoward pharmacodynamic effects of cantharidin with systemic exposure have  
largely focused on the cardiovascular system. With acute systemic exposure of rats to 
oral dosing with 6.9 mg/kg  (41.4 mg/m2) of cantharidin, cardiac waveform  and function 
were adversely  affected,  likely  related  to its inhibitory effect  on protein  
phosphatases.[11]. Cantharidin is a vasoconstrictor and may also be responsible for  
decreases in urine volume with single oral dose administration.[11, 12] However, it is  
possible that cantharidin may have a direct effect on the renal vascular and tubular  
epithelium via its inhibitory  action  on protein phosphatases. Cantharidin may also have  
an effect on central nervous system function,[11] although it is unclear whether noted 
decreases  in locomotion  and reduced  body  temperature  were  secondary  to the 
cardiovascular  manifestations noted with the  high doses. 
 
Information available on the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of cantharidin showed 
that oral absorption of cantharidin in rats and dogs is rapid but incomplete, with peak 
systemic  exposures  occurring by 2 hours  in rats (Section  6.2 of the IB).[13] The apparent  
plasma elimination half -life of cantharidin was about 20 minutes in dogs.[14] Tissue  
distribution of cantharidin was ubiquitous, consistent with the widespread distribution  
of protein phosphatases.

 Nonclinical  toxicity  information  available on cantharidin  is predominantly from  single  
dose (acute)  studies  by the dermal,  oral,  intraperitoneal,  and intravenous  (IV) routes  of 
administration  (Section  6.3 of the IB). The only adverse findings  associated  with acute 
dermal exposure to cantharidin in animals were local irritation and skin blistering. No  
systemic toxicity  was noted  by this route  in animals.  
 
With an extensi ve history of use of cantharidin in humans, a limited nonclinical  
program  has been  developed to support  the use of  topical  (dermal)  VP-102. No 
nonclinical primary pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic studies were conducted by  
Verrica using either  VP-102 or cantharidin. A single  Good Laboratory Practices  (GLP) - 
compliant  study evaluating  inhibition  of the human  ether -à-go-go-related  gene  (hERG) 
channel  as an in vitro cardiovascular  safety  pharmacology endpoint was conducted.  
 
The safety profile of topical cantharidin is already well established from its history of  
use in patients, as well as studies conducted in animals. With negligible systemic  
exposure after topical application, the strategy for the nonclinical toxicology program  
for VP-102 developed  by Verrica  focused  on addressing  the pending concerns  
associated  with  its use as a topical  treatment; thus, Verrica  completed  the GLP  in vitro  
genetic toxicity  testing  battery  with cantharidin, including a  bacterial reverse mutation  
assay,  a mammalian  cell chromosomal  aberration  assay,  and a mammalian  cell 
micronucleus  assay.  
 
An overview of the Verrica -sponsored toxicology studies conducted with cantharidin 
is provided in Table 2.

 Verrica completed one in vitro GLP safety pharmacology study that evaluated the  
concentration  response  relationship  of the effect  of cantharidin  on the hERG  potassium  
channel current in stably transfected mammalian cells that express the hERG gene 
(Study 170922.WFU).  Specifically,  the study examined  the inhibitory effects  of 
cantharidin on the hERG  channel current at near -physiologic temperature. The study  
reported  no change in hERG  current  across  the cantharidin  concentration  range  (30 and 
300 µM). The IC 50 for the inhibitory effect of cantharidin on hERG potassium current  
was estimated to be > 300 μM (> 60,000 ng/mL). At 300 μM, the concentration of  
cantharidin is > 17,000- fold higher than the highest level of cantharidin detected  
systemically  (3.4 ng/mL)  in a clinical  exposure  study conducted with topical  
administration  of VP-102 in molluscum patients (Study VP-102-103). 
 
Verrica  completed  a GLP -compliant  in vitro  genetic toxicity  test battery  with 
cantharidin. Three in vitro genotoxicity studies were conducted: a bacterial reverse  
mutation assay (Ames test), a mammalian ce ll micronucleus assay in TK6 human 
lymphoblastoid cells, and a mammalian cell chromosomal aberration assay in human  
peripheral  blood lymphocytes (HPBL).  
 
For the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Study AE58BG.502ICH.BTL), cantharidin 
was evaluated for its mutagenic potential by measuring its ability to induce reverse  
mutations at selected loci of Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537, and at the tryptophan locus  of Escherichia  coliWP2  uvrA in the presence and 
absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. Based on the results of the  
preliminary toxicity assay, the maximum dose to be tested in the mutagenicity assay  
was 5000 µg/plate. At all concentrations tested, cantharidin was negative at select loci  
of several  S. typhimurum  and E. coli tester  strains,  suggesting that cantharidin  does not 
possess mutagenic  properties. 
 
In the mammalian  cell chromosomal  aberration  assay,  cantharidin  was evaluated  for its 
potential  to induce structural  chromosomal  aberrations  using HPBL in  either the  
presence or the absence of an exogenous  metabolic  activation  system  (Study  
AE58BG.341ICH.BTL). Overly condensed and distorted metaphase chromosomes  
were noted during the assay at several concentrations with < 50% cytotoxicity, which  
did not allow  for an adequate evaluation  of the test samples  that would  meet  the criteria  
for a valid assay in accordance with ICH S2(R1) guidance, and thus the study was  
terminated  before  completion.

 The mammalian  cell genotoxicity study assessed  the clastogenic  potential of 
cantharidin  (Study AE58BG.361CRESTICH.BTL). Specifically,  cantharidin was 
evaluated  for its potential  to induce  micronuclei  in TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells in 
either the presence or absence of an exogenous metabolic activation system. A dose - 
dependent increase in micronuclei formation was observed in the non- activated 27-  
hour treatment  group with cantharidin  doses  of 1 µg/mL  (1.25%)  to 1.6 µg/mL  (2.25%)  
compared  with vehicle  (0.65%).  An increase  in micronuclei  formation  was not 
observed at similar concentrations with a 4- hour exposure. Compared with the vehicle  
group, an increase in micronucleus induction in either the absence or presence of an 
exogenous  metabolic  activation  system  was observed  at higher  cantharidin  
concentrations  of 3.5 µg/mL  (1.40%  vs 0.55%, respectively)  and 5.5 µg/mL  (1.20%  vs 
0.60%, respectively)  in the 4-hour treatment groups. Subsequent  analysis  with 
calcinosis,  Raynaud's  phenomenon, esophageal  dysmotility,  sclerodactyly,  and 
telangiectasia (CREST) staining revealed that a high frequency of micronuclei in the 
presence of kinetochore  staining  was observed in the cantharidin -treated  cells,  
suggesting that cantharidin induces micronuclei formation through an aneugenic, and 
not a clastogenic, mechanism of action.

 4.3.1 Study  VP-102-103: Phase  2 Study  Evaluating Safety,  Efficacy  and Systemic  
Exposure  after  VP-102 Treatment  in Subjects with  Childhood  Molluscum  
 
VP-102 in the proprietary applicator  was determined  to be safe in a 12-week,  open-
label, Phase 2 study (VP -102-103) implemented under Investigation New Drug (IND) 
application 131163/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. The primary objective of the study was to 
evaluate the potential  systemic  exposure  to cantharidin under  maximum use conditions  
(> 21 lesions treated). Subjects ≥ 2 years of age with molluscum contagiosum were  
enrolled and treated with VP -102 (a single -use proprietary applicator containing a  
novel 0.7% w/v cantharidin solution) every 21 days for up to 4 treatments or until  
complete  lesion  clearance.  Subjects  were instructed  to wash  VP-102 off at 24 hours, or 
earlier  if significant  pain or blistering.  Lesion  counts  and adverse events  (AEs),  
including local skin reactions (LSRs), were documented at each visit. Quality of life  
(QoL) was measured using the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI).  
A subset of 17 subjects with ≥ 21 MC lesions at baseline were evaluated for systemic  
exposure with 4 blood samples (pre -dose and at 2, 6, and 24 hours post -dose). Key 
efficacy endpoints were percentage of subjects exhibiting complete clearance of all  
treated MC lesions (baseline and new) on or before Week 12 and percentage of  
reduction of  treated MC lesions from  baseline at  Week 12.  
 
The mean age was 6.7 (range 2 -15) years for the 33 subjects enrolled. The majority of  
subjects were male (54.5%), white (90.9%), and not Hispanic/Latino (93.9%), with a  
mean time since diagnosis of 36 days and no previous  treatment  for molluscum  
(60.6%).  
 
Treatment with VP -102 was well -tolerated. A total of 29 subjects (88%) reported at  
least one treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE), including expected LSRs such as  
blistering or erythema. Most subjects had mild TEAEs; 3 subjects had moderate  
TEAEs.  Overall,  21 (63.6%)  subjects  had TEAEs  related to  study  drug, most  of which  
were  LSRs.  There were  no serious  adverse events  (SAEs)  or TEAEs  leading to  
premature study withdrawal.  
 
Treatment  with VP-102 was associated  with significantly  reduced  lesion  count,  
improved QoL, and complete clearance of MC lesions. Sixteen (16) subjects (48.5%)  
achieved complete clearance of all MC lesions on or before Week 12. The median  
lesion count was reduced 98% from baseline to Week 12. Decreases in mean CDLQI  
composite  scores  were observed, from 2.58 (standard deviation =  3.446) at baseline  to

 0.38 (standard  deviation  =0.871)  at Week  12. No subjects  reported  spread  of 
molluscum  lesions to any  siblings during the study. 
 
Plasma drug levels were below the limit of quantitation in 65 of 66 samples. In one  
subject,  the level  was slightly  above  the lower  limit  of quantitation  2 hours  after VP-102 
application  but was not detectable at 6 and 24 hours. Importantly,  no systemic  
cantharidin  was detected  in the patient  with  the highest  number  of lesions  (113 lesions  
treated)  nor in the  two subjects with genital involvement.  
 
In a separate double -blind, Phase 2 study (12- 01-004), topical cantharidin (0.7% w/v)  
was well tolerated and  associated with the clearance of MC in 94 subjects with  
childhood molluscum.[15] 
 
4.3.2 Study  16-10-195: VP-102 Bridging  Study  of Subjects  with  Childhood Molluscum  
 
A bridging study (16- 10-195), conducted under IND #114032, was implemented to  
confirm VP -102’s similarity in safety and efficacy to a 0.7% compounded cantharidin 
formulation  used previously under  the same IND.  For this study, VP-102 was packaged  
in single -use, screw -top vials  and applied  with the wooden part of a cotton- tipped swab  
to two cohorts of subjects. The first cohort investigated a 6- hour treatment duratio n. A 
second  cohort investigated a  24-hour treatment duration.  
 
In total,  30 subjects  were enrolled  with childhood molluscum,  14 subjects  in the 6-hour 
cohort  and 16 subjects  in the 24- hour cohort.  
 
VP-102 was safe and well tolerated in the treatment of pediatric molluscum with both  
a 6-hour and 24-hour duration of exposure  on the skin, consistent  with historically  used 
cantharidin formulations. There were no unexpected treatment -related AEs reported  
during application to molluscum lesions in 14 subjects in the 6- hour exposure cohort.  
Moreover, there  were no treatment -related  AEs reported  with application  to 712 lesions  
in 16 subjects in the 24- hour exposure  cohort.  
 
Overall, 11 out of 25 (44%) subjects showed complete clearance in t he Per -Protocol  
(PP) Population. The 6- hour and 24- hour application demonstrated similar tolerability  
and efficacy in this study. VP -102 was similarly effective compared to compounded  
cantharidin, as  evaluated  in Study 12-01-004.

 4.3.3 Cantharidin Study  in Subjects  with  Genital Warts  
 
One study of cantharidin for the treatment of genital warts has been published. A  
randomized, controlled trial of cantharidin was conducted in 12 patients  with non-
mucosal  genital  warts.[1] Patients  were  randomized to either  compounded cantharidin  
(n=6  patients  with 15 warts)  or TCA  (n=6  patients  with 14 warts)  treatment.  Cantharidin 
was applied to the skin and allowed to dry, covered with a transparent  adhesive 
waterproof film dressing, and after 4 to 6 hours, the treatment area was  washed with 
soap and water to control skin exposure. Cantharidin was more effective  and better  
tolerated  than TCA  for the treatment  of lesions. Complete  clearance of warts  occurred 
in 100% of patients treated with cantharidin and 66% of patients treated with TCA 
(P=0.45). Patients treated with cantharidin, compared to TCA, healed with less  
scarring  (P<0.034), had less pain during treatment  (P<0.01), and required  fewer  
treatments  to eradicate warts (P<0.01).  
 
4.4 Summary  of Known  Benefits and  Potential  Risks  
 
4.4.1 Potential  Benefits  
 
No studies with VP -102 have been conducted in subjects with genital warts and the  
potential benefit is uncertain. It is anticipated that subjects participating in this study  
who are randomized to the VP -102 group will experience at least similar therapeutic  
benefits as subjects treated with VP -102 or 0.7% w/v cantharidin in previous clinical  
studies. Efficacy data for VP -102 and cantharidin are provided in Section 4.3 and  
described  in the IB. 
 
Approximately 80% of the subjects  enrolled  in Part A of this study will be randomized  
to receive VP -102. Approximately 60% of the subjects enrolled in Part B of this study 
will be  randomized to receive VP -102.

No studies with VP -102 have been conducted in subjects with genital warts, and thus  
the potential risks are uncertain. Safety and PK data for VP -102 are provided in  
Section 4.3 and described in the IB. Nonclinical data for VP -102 are presented in  
Section  4.2 and described  in the IB. Although the study drug will be labeled  exclusively  
for topical  application  and will be applied  only by study personnel, the formulation  also 
contains an oral deterrent (denatonium benzoate) to further help mitigate the risk of  
accidental  ingestion. 
 
The mechanism of action of cantharidin, when applied externally, is that of a vesicant  
(blistering  agent)  and can cause severe chemical  burns  at high concentrations.  
Cantharidin taken internally can be poisonous to humans. Cantharidi n is classified as  
an extremely  hazardous  substance  in the United  States  and is subject  to strict reporting 
requirements by facilities that produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.[16] 
However, cantharidin can be safely and effectively used to treat some benign skin 
lesions when formulated properly and applied in the clinic topically by a medical  
provider  familiar  with its effects and uses.[17] 
 
The most frequently reported AEs in clinical trials with VP -102 conducted in subj ects 
with MC were application site vesicles, application site scab, application site pain,  
application  site erythema,  and application  site pruritus.  These  are well-known,  
reversible reactions  of the skin that are related  to the mechanism  of action  of 
cantharidin, a  vesicant.  
 
4.4.3 Potential  Risks  
 
Cantharidin is a member of the Terpenoid Class. The Terpenoid Class is a large and 
diverse  class of naturally  occurring organic  chemicals derived from terpenes.  
 
Because there may be unknown and potential risks with administration of VP -102, all  
subjects  will be closely  monitored for safety  and tolerability  by repeated  assessment  of 
clinical,  vital signs, and reporting of AEs.  
 
4.4.4 Risk -Benefit  Summary  
Overall,  based  on risk/benefit  analysis,  the current  study appears  to be fully  justified  in 
the planned population of subjects with genital warts.

 4.5 Justification  for Dosing  Regimen  
This study will evaluate VP-102, a controlled, highly- pure, standardized  form  of topical  
cantharidin manufactured under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to address the  
problems  associated  with currently  available compounded cantharidin  products  and the 
needs  of subjects  and medical professionals.  
 
A 0.7% w/v cantharidin solution is the recognized therapeutic dose of cantharidin for  
wart treatment in dermatological  clinical  practice.[7, 18-21] VP-102, a drug- device  
combination containing 0.7%  w/v cantharidin, was determined  to be safe and effective 
in two recently completed  double -blind,  randomized,  placebo -controlled, Phase 3 
studies  that enrolled  > 500 subjects  ≥ 2 years  of age with molluscum  contagiosum. The 
only published study of cantharidin for the treatment of genital warts demonstrated 
enhanced safety and efficacy with a 0.7% cantharidin solution applied for 4 to 6 hours  
with occlusion compared  to TCA.[1] Additionally, multiple  publications  have 
demonstrated safety and efficacy with a 0.7% cantharidin solution in common warts, 
both with and without the  use of surgical tape.[7, 18-24]. 
 
In this study, lesions will be covered with surgical tape, a technique often used in the  
treatment of warts with cantharidin. It is believed that this technique helps the drug  
penetrate into  the hyperkeratotic tissue and may result in improved efficacy. This will  
also eliminate unintentional transference of study drug to healthy tissue.  
 
Study drug will be applied in sufficient quantity to cover the entirety of each wart, including approximat ely a 1 mm  margin of surrounding, healthy skin. 
 
The duration of skin exposure to cantharidin, the active ingredient in VP -102, will be  
controlled in this study. In Part A, VP -102 will remain on the skin for up to 2 hours in  
group 1 and the exposure will be increased to 6 and 24 hours in subsequent groups  
based on the assessment of safety and tolerability. The duration of skin exposure will  
be modulated by washing of the treatment area at either the pre -determined time per  
protocol or based on clinical response (e.g., significant blistering or pain), consistent  
with current  clinical  practice with the use of cantharidin  (directions  for use are provided 
in Section 8.2).[17] The 2 -hour duration of skin exposure was selected as the starting 
point based on a published clinical study with 0.7% cantharidin, which demonstrated  
favorable safety and efficacy with a 4 - to 6- hour treatment duration. The 6- hour and 
24-hour time periods  were selected  to allow  a safe and controlled step-wise increase in

 skin exposure  that would  be expected  to result  in a meaningful  increase in the 
pharmacodynamic  response  in the  skin (e.g., blistering).  
 
The dosing regimen for Part B will be selected based on the response observed in 
subjects  during the dose  regimen  finding performed in Part A.  
 
4.6 Population  to be Studied 
In this study, adult  subjects  ages 18 and  older, with  external  genital  warts  (EGW),  will 
be included. External genital warts are defined as warts located in the medial thigh  
(except  inguinal  fold);  supra -pubic, perineal,  and perianal  areas,  vulva  (excluding labia  
minora and mucosal surfaces), over the glans penis (excluding urethral meatus), penis  
shaft,  scrotum, and foreskin. 
 
4.7 Statement  of Compliance  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice  
(GCP), the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable regulatory 
and Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  or Independent  Ethics  Committee  (IEC)  
requirements.

 6.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
6.1 Description  of the  Study  
 
This is a Phase  2, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to determine  the dose 
regimen,  safety,  tolerability,  and efficacy  of VP-102 in subjects  with  EGW.  This study 
is divided into two parts (Part A and Part B). The Schedule of Assessments and 
Procedures  is presented in  Table 1.  
 
6.1.1 Part  A (dose  regimen  finding) Study  Design  
 
The aim of Part A is to determine the two best treatment regimens for evaluation of  
safety  and efficacy  in Part B.  
 
Treatment  regimens  will be evaluated  based  on the requirement  to form  blisters  in most  
patients, while maintaining a favorable safety and tolerability profile (e.g., majority of  
LSR AEs are mild or moderate in severity). Accordingly, increasing durations of skin exposure  to study drug (VP-102 or placebo)  will be evaluated  in three treatment groups  
(n=6/group)  that will enroll progressively.  
 
Subjects will have a Screening Period of up to 14 days before the first treatment, 
followed by a Treatment Period starting at Treatment Visit 1 and lasting through  
Treatment  Visit 4.  
 
Eighteen (18) subjects at up to six sites (additional sites may be added if required to  
ensure successful recruitment of the study population) will be enrolled, into either the  
2-hour (Group 1), 6 -hour (Group 2), or 24- hour (Group 3) treatment duration of skin 
exposure groups (n=6 subjects/group). Each group will include a minimum of two  
subjects from each sex and will be randomized 5:1 (VP -102:placebo) within each  
group. All subjects will receive either VP -102 (containing 0.7% cantharidin [w/v]  
topical film- forming solution) or placebo. Warts are to be treated and then covered  
(unless  prohibited by wart location)  with transparent  surgical  tape (e.g., 3M™  
Blenderm™ brand) that will remain on the skin until the designated time for removal. 
Subjects will be asked to remove the surgical tape and study drug with soap and water  
after the pre -determined  duration of  skin exposure  for their group.

VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  43  
 Study drug (VP -102 or placebo) will be administered once every 21 ±4 days for up to 
four applications. Enrollment will begin in Group 1, then proceed into Group 2, and 
lastly  into Group 3. The enrollment  of subjects  into Groups  2 and 3 will only be allowed  
upon completion of a blinded review of the safety and tolerability data by a Safety  
Review Panel. The Safety Review Panel will be responsible for reviewing blinded 
safety  and tolerability  data and will provide  determinations  on trial stopping or 
modification rules. A blinded review of TEAEs, focusing on those of moderate or  
severe intensity, will be performed by the Safety Review Panel prior to opening enrollment for  each subsequent cohort. This review will be conducted after the six  
subjects  in a designated  Group have  completed  the 48-hour (±8 hours)  Visit.  The Safety  
Review Panel will determine whether enrollment can be initiated into the next Group,  
OR if more data (e.g., waiting for additional treatments for enrolled subjects or the  
addition of more subjects to a group) are needed prior to making a determination to  
open enrollment into  the next Group (i.e., the review  conducted after six subjects  have  
completed  Group 1 could open enrollment into Group 2 and the review after Group 2  
could open enrollment into Group 3). An additional blinded safety review of TEAEs, focusing on those of moderate or severe intensity, will be performed after all six 
subjects in Group 3 have completed the 48- hour (±8 hours) Visit, in order to support  
dose selection for Part B (Safety and Efficacy). Safety Review Panel members are  
blinded to the  treatment assignment.  
 
6.1.2 Part  B (safety  and efficacy) Study  Design  
 
Part B of the study will b egin enrollment only after the Sponsor has selected the two  
dose regimens in Part A, which will be called VP -102 Regimen 1 and Regimen 2. In 
addition, written notification from the Sponsor must be provided to the sites prior to Part B enrollment. The study will remain blinded until completion of both parts of the  
study. 
 
Approximately 90 subjects  at up to 9 sites (additional  sites  may  be added  if required  to 
ensure  successful  recruitment  of the study population)  will be enrolled  and randomized  
to one of four treatment arms. Randomization will be stratified by sex so that neither  
gender exceeds ~60% of any treatment arm (e.g., placebo group for the 6- hour and  
24-hour wash -off cannot have any one gender ≥ 60%). Two of the treatment arms will  
be VP -102 Regim en 1 and VP -102 Regimen 2. The other two treatment arms will be  
placebo  (Placebo  Regimen  1 and Placebo  Regimen  2), with corresponding durations  of 
skin exposure  matching  those  selected  for VP-102 Regimen  1 and Regimen  2. As an

 example, if the regimens selected from Part A are the 2 -hour and 6- hour applications  
of VP -102, then VP -102 Regimen 1 would be VP -102 treatment for 2- hours and VP-
102 Regimen  2 would be VP-102 treatment for 6-hours. Likewise,  Placebo  Regimen 
1 would be placebo treatment for 2 hours and Placebo Regimen 2 would be  placebo 
treatment for 6 -hours. Randomization of the four treatment arms (VP -102 Regimen  
1:VP -102 Regimen  2: Placebo  Regimen  1:Placebo  Regimen  2) will be  3:3:2:2. 
 
In both Regimen  1 and Regimen  2, study drug will be administered  to EGW  once  every  
21 ±4 days for up to four applications. Subjects will be asked to remove the surgical  
tape and study drug with soap and water at the designated time selected from the dose  
regimen  findings in Par t A of the  study. 
 
6.1.3 Part  A and Part  B Procedures  
 
6.1.3.1 Subject  Participation  
 
Pre-study screening for eligibility (informed consent, demographics, physical exam, 
vital signs, prior and concomitant medications, and medical history) can occur up to  
14 days before,  or on the same day  as Treatment  Visit 1. The dermatologic  exam,  wart  
count, wart measurement  (diameter),  location  of all warts,  and photographs  (if 
applicable)  must  be repeated  at Treatment  Visit 1 if the Screening  Visit is not conducted 
on the same day. Warts must measure ≤ 8 mm in diameter each with a total wart area  
(i.e., all warts combined) ≥ 10 mm2 at baseline. Wart count must be ≥ 2 and ≤ 30 total  
warts  within the  allowed  treatment  areas at  the time  of Treatment Visit 1. 
 
Subjects  who do not continue  to meet  criteria  at Treatment  Visit 1  will be considered a 
screen failure and will be treated at physician discretion per standard of care. Subjects  
who meet the enrollment criteria will be randomized to receive VP -102 or placebo.  
Treatment  will continue  with a minimum of every  21 ±4 days, until complete  clearance 
or a maximum  of four treatment  sessions.  The exact  treatment interval  will be 
determined  by evaluation  of the treatment site and take any ongoing LSRs  into account.  
Subjects  who achieve complete  clearance of all treatable warts  before  Treatment  Visit 4 
will be required  to return  for every  scheduled, in-person, treatment  and follow -up visit,  
whether or not their warts have cleared. The 24- hour, 7- day, and 14 -day evaluation of  
response to treatment (ERT) telephone follow -ups will be conducted per protocol for  
those  instances in which  the subject was treated.

 6.1.3.2 Efficacy  Procedures  
 
All required  study activities,  including an ERT (i.e., assessment  of wart activity  [count,  
location, diameter] and related LSRs), will be conducted per protocol. A Blinded 
Assessor will perform wart counts before the ERT assessment at Treatment Visit 2,  
Treatment  Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, End of  Treatment  Visit,  and Follow -up Visit.  
 
Treatment  visits  are to take place in order  (i.e., Treatment  1, Treatment  2, Treatment  3, 
and Treatment  4). All subjects  will receive application  of study  drug to EGW,  including  
an approximate margin of healthy surrounding skin, at an interval of every 21 ±4 days  
until complete  clearance of  all treatable warts,  or a maximum  of four  applications. 
 
No partial treatment of warts (e.g., treating one wart and not another) is permitted. In  
any instance where the clinician is uncertain if a residual wart is remaining, treatment  
should be applied. Instructions for application of the study drug are outlined in the  
Instructions for Use included in the drug shipment, as well as incl uded in the Site  
Regulatory Packet.  
 
Subjects should be re -treated only after 17 to 25 days (i.e., 21 ±4 days) have elapsed  
since  the previous  treatment  and only after any LSRs  have  resolved  sufficiently  to allow  
evaluation of the treatment site. Treatment should only take place at a visit when all  
warts are evaluable (i.e., not obscured by an ongoing LSR). All warts that are not  
completely clear should undergo treatment with study drug. Subjects exhibiting skin  
reactions that need additional time,  at the Investigator’s discretion, before they can be  
treated again will be evaluated and asked to return for their next treatment visit after  
the area is considered  sufficiently  resolved  to allow  for the next treatment  (e.g., ongoing  
dryness  or erythema  is appropriate  to treat).  See instructions  below  regarding  
unscheduled visits.  
 
Subjects who receive <4 treatments within the treatment period, or have visits that are  
outside of the visit window due to the duration of post -treatment LSRs, will not be  
considered  a protocol  deviation. In the event  that a subject  misses a treatment  visit,  and 
is outside  the 4-day study  window, they  may return  and be treated  at the next  available 
opportunity with the subsequent visit scheduled 21 ±4 days after the actual treatment  
visit. No treatment should be administered after the treatment period without the  
Sponsor’s  approval.

 An ERT assessment will be conducted at each treatment visit (1 -4; in -person before  
treatment or via follow -up telephone cal ls) at 24 hours (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), 
and 14 days (±24  hours)  after  each treatment  visit (not “unscheduled”  visits).  Note  that 
the ERT telephone  calls at 24 hours  (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours)  and 14 days  
(±24 hours) are not required if there wa s no treatment during that period. In Part A  
Treatment Period 1 only, subjects will return to the clinic for an in- person ERT  
assessment  at 48 hours  (±8 hours)  after Treatment  Visit 1. The ERT  includes  questions  
related to removal of surgical tape and study drug (if applicable) and collects any new  
AEs,  LSRs,  and changes  in concomitant  medications  since the last contact.  The subject  
will be given an opportunity to ask questions  and review  any concerns. In the event  that 
any post -treatment LSR presents a safety concern (including but not limited to severe  
blistering,  ulceration,  edema,  or pain)  an “Unscheduled” clinic  visit must  be scheduled, 
and the subject assessed accordingly. In addition, if any post -treatment AEs present a 
safety concern, t he subject may be brought in for an unscheduled visit. The ERT  
assessments will be recorded by a research team member on the ERT form. The ERT  
visits  may not be conducted by a person designated as a Blinded Assessor.  Phone  calls 
conducted outside of the required study visits or required ERT assessments should be  
documented in the subject’s source note but are not required to be entered in the  
electronic data capture (EDC)  system.  
 
ERT assessments, wart count, and wart location will be conducted before tre atment  
application at all Treatment Visits 1 to 4, as well as at the EOT Visit on Study Day 84  
(0/+8  days)  and at the Follow -up Visits  on Study Day 112 (±7 days)  and Study Day 147 
(±7 days). Wart  measurement  will be conducted  before  treatment application  at 
Treatment  Visit 1, as well as at the EOT  Visit on Study Day 84 (–0/+8  days)  and at the 
Follow -up Visits on Study Day 112 (±7 days) and Study Day 147 (±7 days). Subjects  
who clear  all warts  before  the Study Day 84 (EOT)  Visit will still be  required to return  
for each of the scheduled  in-person treatment  visits,  as well as the Study Day 84 (EOT)  
Visit, the Study Day 112 follow -up visit, and the Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit. A  
Provider Treatment Questionnaire will be completed at the Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit  
by a clinician who applied treatment to the subject during the course of the study. All  
subjects  will continue in the study for two additional  Follow -up Visits  on Study  
Day 112 and Study Day 147 (EOS).  
 
All treatment  visits  will include  a wart count, performed  before  treatment  (if applicable)  
and before ERT assessment. No treatment will be required if the wart is considered  
clear.  Genital  warts  that develop in areas  that are unable  to be treated,  (e.g., close to a

 mucous membrane) and other wart types (e.g., common warts) will not be evaluated,  
documented, or  considered in the  analysis.  
 
Wart counts will be conducted at the Screening Visit, Treatment Visit 1, Treatment 
Visit 2, Treatment Visit 3, Treatment Visit 4, End of Treatment Visit, and Follow -up 
Visit by a trained member of the study team. Other than the screening visit and Day 1,  
wart counts will also be conducted by a member of the research team that has been 
identified  and trained  as a Blinded Assessor.  The Blinded Assessor  may be utilized  for 
a subject’s initial screening, enrollment and treatment Visit 1 activities, however, may  
not perform  any other  study  related  activities  other  than wart counts  at subsequent  visits  
(e.g., follow -up phone calls or unscheduled visits) for the same subject. The Blinded 
Assessor  is not required to be  the same person for  each assessment.  
 
It can sometimes be challenging to determine if a wart is completely clear after  
treatment due to ongoing LSRs. At any visit in which the Investigator is unable to  
evaluate or treat some warts due to ongoing LSRs, an “Unscheduled” visit should be  
documented. The timing of the next visit will be determined by the resolution of the  
LSR. The research team should be in contact with the pati ent until LSRs are resolved  
sufficiently and a treatment visit can be scheduled within 21 ±4 days when possible.  
Specific instructions on  how to conduct the initial wart count and measure wart  
diameter  will be  provided during Investigator training. 
 
At des ignated sites, photography will be offered to volunteer subjects who consent to 
participate. Photography will take place at the clinical site at each treatment and  
follow -up study visit through Study Day 147 (±7 days; EOS). If there are no warts  
remaining, the same areas will be photographed and repeated at the Study Day 84  
(0/+8 days) EOT Visit and Study Day 147 (±7 days) EOS visit, regardless of whether  
warts are present. The images may be used on handouts in future trials, for training  
purposes, or futur e marketing materials. They will not be used for any portion of the  
efficacy or safety data. Photographs will be de -identified to those outside the research  
team and stored in a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  
compliant  manner.  Efforts  will be made to ensure  that no photographs  with identifiable  
features  are obtained.

 6.1.3.3 Safety  Procedures  
 
Subjects will be provided with take home instructions describing what they might  
expect  throughout  the course  of the study, as well as recommendations  for wound care  
(if needed),  when  it is important  to call their doctor, and instructions  for who to contact  
in an emergency. In the event that any post -treatment LSR presents a safety concern  
(including but not limited  to severe  blistering,  ulceration, edema,  or pain),  an 
“Unscheduled” clinic visit must be scheduled and the subject assessed accordingly. In  
addition, if any post-treatment  AEs present  a safety  concern,  the subject  may be brought  
in for an unscheduled visit. 
 
An LSR guide for subjects, with specific photographs representing the various skin  
reactions  and examples  of intensity,  will be provided and reviewed  in detail  at the clinic  
with the subject by the research team. The LSR guide will be utilized for reference by  
the subject during the ERT follow -up telephone assessments with the research team  
member.  The final determination  of LSR parameters,  including intensity,  will be  made  
by the research team member.  
 
6.2 Number  of Subjects  
 
In Part A, 18 subjects  will be enrolled  into one of three duration of skin exposure  groups  
(n=6 subjects/group). Each group will include a minimum of two subjects from each  
sex and will  be randomized 5:1 (VP -102:placebo)  within each  group.  
 
In Part B, 90 subjects will be enrolled, randomized to one of four treatment arms.  
Randomization will be stratified by sex so that neither gender exceeds ~60% of any 
treatment arm (e.g., placebo group for the 6- hour and 24- hour wash -off cannot have  
any one gender ≥  60%) . 
 
6.3 Measures  Taken  to Minimize  Bias 
 
Bias is minimized by  subject randomization and blinding (Section  6.5). 
 
6.4 Expected  Duration  of Subject  Participation  
 
Study duration from  Treatment  Visit 1 through the final follow -up visit is 
approximately 147 days (21 weeks).  The length of study participation  is approximately

 84 (–0/+8) days for the EOT assessment (primary endpoint) and Study Day 147 (±7)  
days to complete the study, in addition to the screening visit of up to 14 days before  
study drug admi nistration. The study will consist of up to four applications of study 
drug at intervals of 21 ±4 days. All treatments will take place within a 75 -day period. 
No treatment should be administered after Day 75 without the Sponsor’s approval. 
Post-treatment F ollow -up Visits  on Study Day 84 (–0/+8 days)  (EOT),  Study Day 112 
(±7 days),), and Study Day 147 (±7 days) are included for subjects to evaluate the  
durability  of treatment response over time.  
 
6.5 Method  of Treatment  Assignment  and Blinding  
 
After  informed  consent  has been  obtained, subjects  will be screened  for study eligibility  
before randomization. Subjects will be assigned a subject number and randomized. In  
Part A, each group will include a minimum of two subjects from each sex randomized  
5:1 (VP-102: or placebo).  In Part B, randomization  of the four treatment  arms  (VP-102 
Regimen  1:VP -102 Regimen  2: Placebo  Regimen  1:Placebo  Regimen  2) will be 
3:3:2:2. The study site’s  pharmacist  (or pharmacist  designee)  will obtain the study drug 
assignment from the Interactive Response Technology (IRT). A subject is considered  
randomized  when the  randomization transaction  is recorded in  the IRT. 
 
The Sponsor will remain blinded to study medication assignment until the study is  
completed and the database is locked, with the exception of cases in which unblinding  
is required due to a safety or tolerability issue. In the case of a medical emergency  
requiring the PI to know  the identity  of the study drug, the PI will follow  the procedures  
outlined in  Section  8.6.

7.3 Requalification  for Entry  
 
Subjects not fulfilling the entry criteria and not randomized may be rescreened for  
participation  if their eligibility  characteristics have  changed.  
 
7.4 Subject  Withdrawal  Criteria  
 
Subjects are encouraged to complete the study, but can withdraw consent at any time  
during the study and for any reason without any penalty or changes to care. The  
Investigator will provide a written explanation of the reason for discontinuation in a  
sourc e document  and this information  will also be recorded  on the appropriate  
electronic case report form (eCRF) page. If a subject withdraws before completion,  
every effort should be made to complete the  EOS (Study Day 147)  assessments  
scheduled  during the EOS  visit.  
 
A subject may be withdrawn from the study for the reasons described in Section 7.4.1 
through Section  7.4.5.  
 
Data  collected  to the point  that the subject  withdraws  or is withdrawn are still 
assessable by the Investigator. If subjects do not want their data that has already been  
submitted,  they will need  to submit  a request  in writing  to the Investigator  for removal  
of their information.

 7.4.1 Adverse Event  
 
If a subject experiences  an AE that, in the judgment of the Investigator, the Sponsor, 
or the Medical Monitor, presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject,  
the subject may  be discontinued from the  study. 
 
7.4.2 Intercurrent  Illness  
 
A subject may be discontinued from the study if, in the judgment of the Investigator,  
the subject develops an intercurrent illness or complication that is not consistent with  
the protocol  requirements or  that, in  any way,  justifies withdrawal from the study. 
 
7.4.3 Noncompliance  
 
After the Investig ator, the Medical Monitor and/or Study Monitor consult (and the  
Sponsor  if appropriate), a subject  may be discontinued from  the study  for the following  
administrative  reasons:  
 
• Failure  to receive study medication  or treatment  as mandated  by the specific 
instructions  provided in Section 8.0. 
 
• Failure  to comply with protocol requirements  
 
7.4.4 Refusal  of Investigational  Product  Administration  
 
Any subject  refusing  clinical  trial material  for any reason  will be discontinued from  the 
study, and the reason(s)  for their discontinuation will be documented on the appropriate  
eCRF page. Reasonable efforts should be made to monitor the subject for AEs and to 
complete follow -up assessments after treatment discontinuation. These efforts should 
be documented on the  appropriate  eCRF  page.  
 
7.4.5 Withdrawal  of Consent  
 
Any subject  who withdraws  consent  for any reason  at any time during the study will be 
discontinued from the study, and the reason(s) will be documented on the appropriate  
source and  eCRF page.  If subjects do not want their data that has already been  
submitted,  they will need  to submit  a request  in writing  to the Investigator  for removal  
of their information.

 7.5 Replacement  of Subjects  
 
Subjects  prematurely  withdrawn  from  the study as dropouts  (e.g., enrolled  in the study 
but never received study drug, did not complete the EOT and EOS assessments), for  
noncompliance, or who request  to be withdrawn  from  the study may be replaced  at the 
discretion  of the Sponsor. 
 
7.6 Premature Study  or Site Termination  
 
If the Sponsor,  Investigator, Medical  Monitor, Study Monitor, or appropriate  regulatory 
officials  discover  conditions  arising  during the study  that indicate  that the study should  
be halted  or that the site should be  terminated,  this action  may  be taken  by the Sponsor  
after appropriate consultation among the Sponsor, Investigator, Medical Monitor, and  
Study Monitor. Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are  
not limited to, the  following:  
 
• The discovery of an unexpected,  serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects  
enrolled in the  study 
• A decision  on the part of the Sponsor  to suspend or discontinue  testing,  evaluation, 
or development of the product  
• Termination  of study conduct  at an individual  site may also be warranted  under  the 
following conditions:  
− Failure  of the Investigator  to enroll  subjects  into the study at an acceptable rate 
− Failure of the Investigator to comply with pertinent regulations of appropriate  
regulatory authorities  
− Submission of knowingly  false information  from  the site to the Sponsor, Study 
Monitor, or  appropriate  regulatory authority  
− Insufficient  adherence  to protocol  requirements  
 
Study termination  and follow -up will comply  with the conditions  set forth  in 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6, Guideline for GCP. Data from all  
sites, including those that have been terminated for non- compliance or unsatisfactory  
enrollment will be evaluated and included in the inter pretation of study findings.  
Subjects  from  sites that terminate  early  will be considered  for analysis.  If a subject  does 
not complete  the study, they  will still be  counted as a  failure  for the primary  endpoint.

 8.0 STUDY DRUGS  
 
8.1 Investigational  Agent  and Placebo  
 
The VP -102 single -use applicator contains 0.45 mL of 0.7% w/v cantharidin. The  
placebo single -use applicator is comprised of the same formulation as the VP -102 
applicator  but does not  contain  the active pharmaceutical  ingredient cantharidin. 
 
Although the study drug will be labeled  exclusively  for topical  application, the 
formulation also contains an oral deterrent (denatonium benzoate) to further help 
mitigate  the risk of accidental  ingestion. The study  drug is light violet  to dark purple  in 
color  and has been manufactured under GMP.  
 
Each lot of applicators will be released for clinical use after a subset has undergone applicator suitability testing and demonstrated that they can deliver drug product in a  
controlled  manner,  without  leaking  or spilling. After  the commercial  product  completes  
all required testing, they will be  released for  use in the  clinical study.  
 
8.2 Directions  for Use 
 
8.2.1 Application  of Study  Drug  and Surgical  Tape  
 
Study drug (VP-102 or placebo)  is contained  within  a single -use applicator.  Per 
protocol, one applicator  may  be used to treat all EGW  lesions  at each subject  treatment  
visit.  
 
Following examination, the product  is applied  to the skin as a viscous  solution, at which  
point the solvents evaporate, leaving behind a thin, flexible, and resilient film. Study  
drug will be applied in sufficient quantity to cover the entirety of each wart, including 
approximately a 1 mm margin of surrounding, healthy skin. Observe subjects for 2 to 
5 minutes after study drug application or  until the  film is formed and totally  dry. 
 
Surgical tape should be applied to lesions that have been treated and gently rubbed in order  to maximize  adherence to the treated  area.  Tape  MUST  NOT  be applied until the 
product  is completely  dry (approximately 2-5 min).  The size of the piece (or  pieces)  of 
surgical  tape used  is based  upon Investigator  discretion, provided that  all treated  warts  
are covered, and the surgical  tape size is deemed  sufficient  to maintain  adherence for

 the assigned duration of skin exposure. An adhesive bandage may be applied over the  
surgical tape if needed for flexible areas. It may not be feasible to apply tape to some  
anatomical locations, in which case an adhesiv e bandage may be used, when possible, 
to protect other skin sites from coming  into contact with  the treated area.  
 
Given the length of time or complexity it may take to treat all warts, Investigators will 
assess, in advance, if subjects will be able to com plete treatment in one treatment  
session. Application of study drug may not be conducted over more than one visit. 
Subjects may be rescheduled for the first treatment, as long as it is within the 14- day 
screening  time period. Otherwise,  they will need  to be rescreened  and consent  reviewed  
to participate.  
 
All subjects will be provided a copy of their signed Informed Consent Form (ICF). At  
each treatment visit,  the subjects  will be provided with both verbal  and written  take-
home instructions covering potent ial side effects and complications, as well as  contact  
information  of the study Investigator/  Coordinator  for any questions  or concerns that 
may arise. Subjects will also be provided an LSR guide to assist the site  in collecting  
the required  ERT  information related  to the treated  areas.  Subjects  should refrain from 
touching, licking, or biting treated skin or putting treated skin in or near  any mucosal 
surface including the mouth, nostrils, eyes, and anogenital area for up to 48 hours 
after treatm ent or until the study drug is removed. Strongly urge subjects not  to touch 
or wash the  treated area for the  assigned  duration of  skin exposure.  
 
Subjects  will receive application  of study drug to all warts  with a minimum of 
21 ±4 days  between   treatment   until   complete   clearance   or   a   maximum   of 
4 applications. The exact treatment interval will be determined by evaluation of the  
treatment  site and take any  ongoing LSRs into account. 
 
Please see the Instructions  for Use provided in each subject -specific  kit, as well as your 
regulatory file, for step-by-step instructions. 
 
8.2.2 Removal  of Surgical  Tape  and Study  Drug  
 
All subjects will have reviewed and are provided with take home instructions on  
removal of the surgical tape and study drug, as well as descriptions of the potential  
LSRs  they might  expect  throughout  the course  of the study;  recommendations  for

 wound care, when it is important to call their doctor, and instructions for whom to 
contact  in an emergency.  
 
Surgical  tape should only be removed  at the designated  times  after study drug 
application, when the treatment site is  washed and  study drug removed. 
 
Subjects  are instructed  to wet  the surgical  tape in a bath  or shower  with water  and then 
slowly peel back an edge of the surgical tape, pulling the surgical tape over itself in a  
“low  and slow”  manner  to prevent  the unroofing of any blisters  that may have  
developed. Gently  remove  any remaining  study drug with soap and water.  Subjects  will 
be cautioned not to use washcloths, abrasive material, or vigorous rubbing to remove  
the study drug, as this may cause temporary pain and damage to the external layer of  
the skin and slow the healing process. Subjects are encouraged to wash their hands  
regularly with soap and water and discouraged from scratching lesions, which can  
spread  disease.  
 
Note: The surgical tape and study drug may be gently removed from individual warts  
before the designated time in the event of significant blistering, signific ant pain, or a  
TEAE. Study drug should not be removed from any remaining unproblematic warts  
until the designated removal time is reached. Subjects who remove study drug before  
the assigned time frame will be considered a protocol deviation, unless early r emoval  
is due to protocol defined  criteria.  
 
Early  removal is defined as removal of  study drug outside of the  following windows:  
 
• ±1-hour window  for 2 -hour duration of  skin exposure  group  
 
• ±2-hour window  for 6 -hour duration of  skin exposure  group  
 
• ±6-hour window for  24-hour duration of  skin exposure  group  
 
8.3 Study  Drug  Storage  
 
Clinical sites will be provided with an initial supply of subject specific kits containing  
4 single -use applicators. Each applicator contains 0.45 mL of study drug (VP -102 or  
placebo) and is individually packaged in a UV protected, zip- top bag. Each bag is  
labeled with all pertinent product information including the corresponding kit number  
it is assigned  to. Applicators  are not numbered  in sequential  order,  but each should be 
DocuSign Envelope ID: E77726CD -B745 -46DC -88B9 -FB9157EEB965  
CONFIDENTIAL  Verrica  Pharmaceuticals  Inc. 
VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  59  
 documented on the drug accountability form as they are used. The zip- top bag should 
not be opened until the site is ready to initiate treatment. Do not dispose of the zip top  
bag, as it  will be  used to store  the used applicator  (Section  8.9).  
 
Study drug must be stored at controlled room temperature (68°F -77°F). Short term  
storage  temperature  excursions  between  59°F -86°F  that are experienced  in the 
physician’s  storage  area and/or  during shipping are allowed,  provided the mean  kinetic 
temperature remains below 25oC. Excursions from 38°F to 59°F that do not result in 
precipitate  formation  are acceptable for use. Short  term storage  temperature excursions  
(spikes  less than 24 hours  in duration)  between  86°F  to 104°F  may be allowed  but must  
be evaluated for impact by the Sponsor before use. Storage temperature excursion  
above  104°F  are not allowed  and will require  replacement  of the study drug. The study 
drug must be stored in a secure, dry location with limited and controlled access, and  
out of direct light. Extended exposure to extreme temperature conditions or to direct  
light should be avoided (e.g., study drug left in an unoccupied vehicle in a hot or cold  
environment). Contact  the study Sponsor  or designee  (i.e., clinical research  
organization) in the event that you believe that any materials may have been exposed 
to such conditions  for guidance. Study drug may be administered  only by the 
Investigator or by a trained member of the clinical site staff specifically as authorized  
by the Investigator.  
 
Stability studies with VP -102 ampules have shown that they are stable for 18 months  
under controlled room temperature conditions. Therefore, this product is considered  
stable for at least 30 months under the recommended storage conditions. Stability  
studies are ongoing and may extend the expiration date. In the event there are any 
changes in extension of the expiration date, sites will be notified by the Sponsor  
accordingly.  
 
8.4 Study  Drug  Labeling  
 
Study drug is  packaged in tamper evident, subject -specific kits, within a cardboard  
carton,  that contains  4 individually packaged  applicators.  Each  applicator  is 
individually contained  in UV protected  and labeled zip -top pouch.  
 
The applicator  is labeled  with the IND application  number  and study protocol  number. 
An example of the applicator label is presented  in Figure  1. 
DocuSign Envelope ID: E77726CD -B745 -46DC -88B9 -FB9157EEB965  
CONFIDENTIAL  Verrica  Pharmaceuticals  Inc. 
VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  60  
 The label also indicates the date of manufacture and includes the required statements  
“Caution:  New  Drug --Limited  by Federal Law  to Investigational  Use.”  and “Warning:  
Flammable Liquid.” The applicator warnings indicate characteristics of the study drug 
including additional labeling “Warning: Flammable Liquid” and the  yellow toxic  
chemical  symbol with  the phrase  “Warning:  Highly Toxic” . 
 
The pouch label includes the IND number, study protocol number, warnings that  
include how to address inadvertent contact in the eye and the applicator assigned  
subject specific kit/randomization number. The pouch label can be seen below in  
Figure  2. 
 
The subject specific kit label includes the same information as indicated on the pouch 
including the subject  specific  kit and randomization number. Please confirm  the pouch  
matches the number on the outside of the kit box prior to using. The kit label can be

In an effort to make it easier for the research personnel to ensure they have pulled the  
correct box at each study visit, a 4th label has been added to the side of the kit box  
providing a space for the research team to write in the randomization number. This  
label  is shown in Figure  4.

 8.5 Compliance  
Treatment compliance for study drugs will be documented in the eCRF by recording 
the date,  subject  identification, and kit number. 
 
8.6 Breaking  the Blind  
This study is a double -blind design. Blinded subjects, Investigators, site staff, and  
Sponsor personnel will not make any effort to determine which study drug therapy is  
being applied. 
 
In the event that unblinding of the study drug assignment is necessary for emergency treatment,  it is required  that the Inves tigator  contact  the Medical  Monitor  immediately.  
Following the discussion on the urgency and requirement for knowing the exact  
treatment, the Medical Monitor will determine whether to unblind and provide the  
treatment  assignment  to the Investigator. All unblinding will be reported  to the 
Sponsor. 
 
8.7 Previous  and Concomitant  Medications  
 
All medications taken within 14 days prior to the first dose of the study drug will be  
classified as prior medication; while all medications used after the  first dose of study  
drug will be classified  as concomitant  medications.  Prior and concomitant  medications  
will be recorded in the eCRF, along with the reasons for administration and durations  
of use. 
 
Treatment  of warts  with any prescription or over-the-counter  wart medication  
(including any HPV immunization), curettage, or freezing of warts should not be  
implemented  during the study. Treatments  for genital  warts  include, but are not limited  
to, the use of cantharidin, antivirals, retinoids, sali cylic acid, lactic acid, hydrogen  
peroxide, candida  antigen,  diphencyprone, dinitrochlorobenzene, sandalwood oil, thuja  
oil, squaric  acid dibutyl  ester,  povidone  iodine, nitric  oxide, any other  over-the-counter  
wart treatment; curettage; or freezing  of warts.  
 
Potential subjects who are systemically immunosuppressed or have required, or will  
require, systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory medication (including oral or parenteral  corticosteroids)  within  30 days before  enrollment  or during the course

 of the study will be excluded. Note that routine use of local (e.g., topical, inhaled, or  
intranasal)  corticosteroids during the study is allowed.  
 
Immunizations and flu shots may be administered throughout the study but not  within  
5 days before  or after treatment.  
 
8.8 Accountability  Procedures  
The pharmacy or trained study personnel are responsible for ensuring that a current  
record  of study drug inventory and accountability is  maintained.  The unique  kit 
numbers on the pouch and kit labels are used for accountability purposes and are  
recorded on the accountability log as they  are used.  
 
The assigned research personnel and study monitor will be responsible for verifying  
drug accountability  at the site. Inventory records  must  be readily  available  for 
inspection by regulatory authorities at any time. Upon receipt of study drug, the  
pharmacy or study personnel will visually inspect the shipment and verify the number  
and condition of kits received. The site will record the receipt of  their inventory in the  
IRT system. All shipping records will be  maintained in  the IRT system.  
 
8.9 Study  Drug  Handling  and Disposal  
 
Used  applicators  are not to be discarded  after use, but should be returned  to their zip-top 
bag and stored in the subject -assigned kit box. All used applicators are to be discarded 
at the site in a sharps container, or per the site’s standard operating procedure (SOP)  
for disposal,  after the Study Monitor  has reviewed  and confirmed  accurate  
accountability. Those  sites that are not allowed  to dispose  of the study drug at their site 
will make arrangements with the Sponsor for return and destruction. All unused 
applicators  and/or  kits are to be returned  to the drug distribution  center  after 
accountability is completed and the Study Monitor has completed the corresponding  
paperwork  to direct the  return.

In the event that any post -treatment LSR presents a safety concern (including but not  
limited to severe blistering, ulceration, edema, or pain), an “Unscheduled” clinic visit  
must  be scheduled  and the subject  assessed  accordingly. In addition, if any post-
treatment AEs present a safety concern, the subject may be brought in for an  
unscheduled visit.  “Unscheduled”  visits  should also be used for visits  in which  
treatment  is unable to be applied to all warts  due to ongoing LSRs.  
 
Subjects  will return  to the clinical  site and the following evaluations  will be performed  
and recorded in the  eCRF.  
 
• Clinical assessments 
− Measure vital signs (temperature,  heart rate)  
 
− Record  reason  why study drug was not administered  at treatment  visit (if 
applicable)

 • Dermatologic  exam  by anatomical location  
 
− Conducted by a study team member  who is not  considered, or  has not acted as,  
the Blinded Assessor  for the  subject  throughout  the subject’s  participation  
 
• ERT assessment  
 
− Only  collect  new information since  the last contact  
 
− All ERT safety assessments must be conducted and recorded on ERT by a  
qualified member of the research team before study drug application; ERT  
assessments must  be conducted by a study team  member  who is not considered, 
or has not acted  as, the Blinded Assessor  for the subject  throughout  the subject’s  
participation  
 
− Warts  that develop in areas  that are unable  to be treated,  (e.g., close to a mucous  
membrane) will not  be evaluated, documented, or considered in the analysis  
 
• Photography 
 
− Subjects  who previously agreed  to participate in the photographic  portion of the 
study will have  photographs of warts taken by  the study team  
 
• Assess,  identify, and  record  any new AEs  
 
• Record  any new concomitant  medications  
 
9.7 Measurements  and Evaluations  
 
9.7.1 Skin Assessments  
 
• Dermatologic  examination,  including Fitzpatrick  skin type  
 
• Wart  count  
 
• Wart  measurement  (diameter)  
 
• Wart  location by anatomical location.

Page  78  
 9.7.2 Identification  of Skin Reactions  
 
An LSR guide for subjects with specific photographs identifying the various skin 
reactions and examples of intensity will be reviewed at the clinic with the subject by  
the research team.  
 
9.7.3 Removal  of Surgical  tape 
 
Subjects  are instructed  to wet the treated  area with water  and then carefully  and slowly  
remove the surgical tape from each wart, pulling the surgical tape back over itself in a  
low and slow manner, trying not to unroof any intact blisters. Treated warts should be  
gently washed  with soap and water  after the surgical  tape is removed. The surgical  tape 
and study drug may be gently removed from individual warts before the assigned duration of skin exposure in the event of significant blistering, significant pain, or  
TEAEs. The surgical tape and study drug should not be removed from any remaining 
unproblematic warts until the designated time point is reached. Washing of intact  
blisters should be gentle and without use of a washcloth. Washing and removal of  
surgical tape in a bath or shower is encouraged. For subjects participati ng in the photo  
portion of the study, photographs should be taken by the subject after the surgical tape  
and study drug are removed.  
 
9.7.4 Evaluation  of Response  to Treatment  Assessments 
 
An ERT assessment will be conducted at each treatment visit (1 -4; in-person before  
treatment or via follow -up telephone calls) at 24 hours (±6 hours), 7 days (±24 hours), 
and 14 days (±24 hours) after each treatment visit (but not after “unscheduled” visits).  
Note  that the ERT  telephone  calls at 24 hours  (±6 hours), 7 days (±24  hours)  and 
14 days (±24 hours) after treatment are not required if there was no treatment during  
that period. In Part A Treatment Period 1 only, subjects will return to the clinic for an  
in-person ERT assessment  at 48  hours  (±8 hours) after Treatme nt Visit 1. 
 
The ERT includes questions related to removal of surgical tape and study drug (if  
applicable) and collects any new AEs, LSRs, and changes in concomitant medications  
since the last contact. The subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions and review  any concerns.

VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  79  
 In the event that any AE presents a safety concern (including but not limited to severe  
blistering, ulceration, edema, or pain) an “Unscheduled” clinic visit may be scheduled  
and the subject assessed  accordi ngly.  
 
The ERT assessments will be recorded by a research team member on the ERT form.  
The ERT visits may not be conducted by a person designated as a Blinded Assessor.  
Phone  calls conducted outside  of the required  study visits  or required  ERT assessments  
should be documented in the subject’s  source  note but are not required  to be entered  in 
the EDC system.  
 
9.7.5 Photographs  of Lesions  
 
At designated sites, photography will be offered to volunteer subjects who consent to  
participate. Photography will take place at the clinical site at each treatment and  
follow -up study visit through Study Day 147 (±7 days) (EOS). If there are no warts  
remaining, the same areas will be photographed and repeated at the Study Day 84 (-
0/+8 days)  EOT  Visit and Study Day 147 (±7 days)  EOS  visit,  regardless  of whether  
warts are present. The images may be used on handouts in future trials, for training  
purposes, or future marketing materials. They will not be used for any portion of the  
efficacy or safety data. Photographs will be de -identified to those outside the research  
team  and stored in a HIPAA -compliant  manner. Efforts will  be made  to ensure  that no 
photographs  with identifiable features are  obtained.

 10.0 ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
 
10.1 Safety  Parameters  
 
Safety analyses will include AEs, LSRs, medical history, physical examinations, vital  
signs, and concomitant medication use  
 
• The incidence of AEs will be assessed throughout the study; AEs will include all  
LSRs, whether or not they are expected  or related to study drug mechanism of  
action.  
 
• LSRs of all previously treated areas will be assessed at each treatment visit using  
the protocol specific  ERT form  
 
• Limited physical examinations will be completed before the first treatment and at 
the Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit; additional  physical  examinations  will be performed  
when clinically warranted (e.g., subject reports symptoms classified as an AE  
requiring further evaluation)  
 
• Vital signs (temperature and heart rate) will be obtained before the treatment is  
applied  at each treatment  visit and at  the start of the  Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit  
 
• Concomitant  medication  use will be collected  at each study visit and ERT telephone  
contact  
 
10.2 Definitions  
 
10.2.1 Adverse Event  
 
The following definition  of AE will be  used for  this study:  
 
Adverse  event  means  any untoward medical  occurrence associated  with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether  or not  considered drug related . 
 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (new or  
exacerbated)  tempo rally associated  with the use of the investigational product,  
regardless  of whether it  is considered to be  related  to the investigational  product.

CONFIDENTIAL  Verrica  Pharmaceuticals  Inc. 
VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  81  
 The following are  examples of AEs:  
 
• Exacerbation  of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including an 
increase in frequency  or intensity of the condition 
 
• New  conditions  detected  or diagnosed after  investigational  product  administration,  
even if they  were present  before  the start of the  study 
 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction with another  
medical  product  
 
• Local skin  reactions (erythema, scaling/flaking/dryness, edema/swelling, small  
blisters,  hyper - and hypopigmentation, scabbing/crusting, erosion/ulcerations,  
scarring,  ring warts)  
 
• Development  of individual  blisters  that are >  25 mm in diameter  (the diameter  of a 
quarter); an aggregated blister composed of a number of smaller blisters is not  
considered  a severe blister  
 
• Blistering  distal to  the treatment  site 
 
• Scarring -independent  of any pigmentary changes;  include  depressed  (atrophic)  and 
elevated  (hypertrophic)  
 
• Secondary  infection  
 
The following are NOT  examples of AEs:  
 
• Medical procedures (The medical condition that led to the procedure as the AE  
should be  reported.)  
 
• Situations that are unwanted by the subject but in which an untoward medical  
occurrence did not occur, for example social inconvenience after admission to a  
hospital  
 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of a pre -existing disease or co ndition (present  
or detected before enrollment) that does  not worsen overall  
DocuSign Envelope ID: E77726CD -B745 -46DC -88B9 -FB9157EEB965

VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  82  
 • Expected  progression of  the disease being  studied, including signs  or symptoms  of 
the disease, unless progression is more severe than expected for the subject’s  
condition. 
 
AEs may include pre -treatment or post -treatment events that occur as a result of  
protocol -mandated  procedures  (e.g.,  invasive  procedures,  modification  of the subject’s  
previous therapeutic regimen). AEs should be captured even if they occur during  
periods without drug treatment or post -treatment periods. AE collection begins after  
the subject  has signed informed consent  and will continue  until  the EOS  visit has  been  
completed.  
 
The Investigator and study personnel will note all AEs mentioned by the subject  
starting from  the day the  informed  consent  is signed until the EOS visit  (Study  
Day 147). All clinical  complaints  volunteered by or elicited  from  the subject  during the 
study will be recorded on the appropriate page of the source and eCRF for the study 
period indicated.  
 
All unresolved AEs will be followed until the condition resolves and/or stabilizes, the  
subject is lost to follow -up or 30- days after the EOS visit, whichever comes first. All  
AEs will be summarized in the a nnual report or more frequently if requested by the  
regulatory agency. SAEs require special reporting in addition to documentation in the  
eCRF  as described in  Section 10.6. 
 
10.2.2 Serious  Adverse Event  
 
In this study, an SAE  is defined as  an AE  that meets  any of the following criteria:  
 
• Results  in death  
 
• Is life-threatening  
 
− The term life-threatening in the definition  of an SAE  refers  to an event  in which  
the subject was at risk of  death at the time  of the event  
 
− The term life-threatening does not refer to an event  that hypothetically might  
have  caused death if it were more  severe  
DocuSign Envelope ID: E77726CD -B745 -46DC -88B9 -FB9157EEB965  
CONFIDENTIAL  Verrica  Pharmaceuticals  Inc. 
VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  83  
 • Requires  hospitalization  or a prolongation of  an existing  hospitalization  
 
− In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained at the  
hospital or em ergency ward for observation or treatment that would not have  
been  appropriate in the physician’s office  or out -patient setting.  
 
− Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs, but not necessarily 
SAEs.  
 
− An occurrence or complication that prolongs hospitalization is an SAE. When 
there is doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE  
should be  considered  an SAE.  
 
− Hospitalization for elective treatments of a preexisting condition that did not  
worsen  from its  original  baseline level is  not considered an SAE.  
 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability  to 
conduct  normal life  functions  
 
− This definition is not intended to include AEs of relatively minor medical  
significance  such as uncomplicated  headache,  nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea,  
influenza and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere or  
prevent  everyday life functions but do not constitute  a substantial disruption. 
 
• Another  important  medical  event  
 
− Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised when deciding whether  
reporting is appropriate for other important medical events that may not result  
in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but still may jeopardize  
the subject  or may require  medical  intervention to prevent  one of  the outcomes  
listed in this definition.  
− These events  should also be considered  serious.  
 
− Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at  
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not  
result  in hospitalization.

VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  84  
 An SAE requires additional detailed reports and follow -up. The content of these  
detailed reports must address the Investigator’s estimate of causality. The Medical  
Monitor  will review  the SAE  to determine  if it is an expected  SAE  (i.e., whether  or not 
the SAE is identified  in nature, severity,  and frequency  in the  VP-102 IB). 
 
10.2.3 Expectedness  of Serious  Adverse Events  
 
An expected AE is one that is consistent with the known risk information described in  
the product label (if applicable) or the current IB. The expectedness of an SAE will be  
assessed  by the Medical  Monitor or  Sponsor  on receipt of the  initial SAE  report.  
 
10.3 Assessment  of Intensity  
 
The Investigator will assess the intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the  
study. The assessment  will be  based  on the  Investigator’s  clinical  judgment. 
 
The classifications  in Table 4  should be used in assigning intensity  of each AE recorded 
in the eCRF.  
 
Table  4. Classification of  Adverse Events  by Intensity  
Intensity  Definition  
Mild  AE An event  that is easily  tolerated  by the subject,  causing  minimal  discomfort  and not  interfering  
with everyday  activities  
Moderate  AE An event  that is sufficiently  discomforting  to the extent  of interfering  with normal  everyday  
activities  
Severe  AE An event  that prevents  the subject  from  performing  normal  everyday  activities  
AE: adverse event.  
 
 
Any AE that changes in intensity during its course will be recorded in the eCRF at the  
highest  level  experienced  by the subject.  
 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a  
category used for rating the intensity of an AE (such as mild, moderate, or severe  
myocardial infarction). However, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical  
significance,  such as a severe headache.  Both AEs and SAEs  can be assessed  as severe.  
An AE is considered serious (an SAE) when it meets one of the predefined outcomes  
described  in Section  10.2.2.

CONFIDENTIAL  Verrica  Pharmaceuticals  Inc. 
VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  85  
 Local Skin Reactions should be rated based on the severity ratings in the Local Skin  
Reaction  Guide  that is provided. 
 
10.4 Assessment  of Causality 
 
The Investigator  must  estimate  the relationship  between  the investigational  product  and 
the occurrence of each AE or SAE  by using  his or her best clinical  judgment. Elements  
to consider for this estimate include the history of the underlying disease, concomitant  
therapy, other  risk factors,  and the temporal  relationship  of the event  to the 
investigational product. The Investigator will also consult the IB or product label for  
marketed  products in estimating the relationship. 
 
Because of reporting timelines, the Investigator might have minimal information to  
include in the initial SAE report. However, the Investigator must always make an  
assessment of causality for every SAE before the transmission of the SAE report. The  
Investigator may change his or her opinion of the causality in light of follow -up 
information, with subsequent amendment of the SAE report. Causality assessment is  
one of the criteria used to determine regulatory reporting requirements and should not  
be left blank in the SAE report. The same applies to AEs that are to be processed as  
SAEs.  Some definitions to use  in the assessment are provided in  Table 5 . 
 
Table  5. Assessment  of Causality of  AEs  
Term  Definition  
Definitely  related  The AE is clearly  related to  the investigational  agent(s)  or research  intervention:  the 
AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s)  
or research  intervention  and follows  a known pattern  of response,  and no alternative  
cause  is present.  
Possibly  related  The AE may be related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention: the AE has a  
temporal  relationship  to the administration  of the investigational agent(s)  or research  
intervention  and follows  a suspected  pattern  of response,  but an alternative  cause  is 
present.  
Probably  related  The AE is likely related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention: the AE has a  
temporal  relationship  to the administration  of the investigational agent(s)  or research  
intervention  and follows a  known or suspected pattern of response, but  an 
alternative  cause  may be present.  
Unrelated  
(or not related)  The AE is clearly  not related  to the investigational  agent(s) or  intervention:  the AE  
has no temporal  relationship  to the administration  of the investigational agent(s)  or 
research  intervention,  and follows no known or suspected  pattern  of response,  and 
an alternative  cause is present.  
AE: adverse event.

VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  86  
 10.5 Recording  Adverse Events  and Serious  Adverse Events  
 
When  an AE or SAE  occurs,  the Investigator  is responsible  for reviewing  all 
documentation (e.g., hospital  progress  notes, laboratory,  and diagnostic  reports) 
relative to the event(s). The Investigator will record all relevant information about any 
AE (including SAEs) on the AE page of the  eCRF.  It is not acceptable for the  
Investi gator  to send photocopies  of the subject’s  medical  records  in lieu of the properly 
completed AE or SAE pages of the eCRF. These documents should not be sent unless  
they are specifically requested by the designated Medical Monitor. If this request  
occurs,  all subject  identifiers  and protected  health  information should be blinded on the 
copies of the medical records before submission to the Sponsor and to the appropriate  
authorities.  
 
The Investigator  will also attempt to report  a diagnosis, instead  of signs, symptoms,  or 
other clinical information, for the AE. The diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, should be documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF as the AE or  
SAE.  In addition, SAEs  need  to be reported  in the SAE  report.  AEs being processed  as 
SAEs  will also require  additional documentation. 
 
10.6 Reporting  of Serious  Adverse Events  
 
Any SAE occurring after the subject signs the ICF must be reported to the Sponsor or  
designee within 24 hours of the time the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE  
(Table 6). 
 
Table  6.          Timeline  for Reporting  of Serious  Adverse Events  
Initial  SAE  Report  Follow -up SAE  Report  
Time  Frame  Documents  Time  Frame  Documents  
24 hours  SAE  report  7 days  Updated SAE  report  
SAE:  serious  adverse event.  
 
 
Urgent  reporting of SAEs  is required for  the following reasons:  
 
• To enable the Sponsor  to fulfill the reporting requirements  to the appropriate  
regulatory authority  
 
• To facilitate  discussion between  the Sponsor  and the Investigator  about  appropriate  
follow -up measures (if necessary)  
DocuSign Envelope ID: E77726CD -B745 -46DC -88B9 -FB9157EEB965  
CONFIDENTIAL  Verrica  Pharmaceuticals  Inc. 
VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  87  
 • To facilitate  the Sponsor’s  rapid  dissemination  of information  about  AEs to other  
Investigators  or sites in a  multicenter  study  
 
• To facilitate  reporting  unanticipated  problems  involving risk to subjects  to the IRB.  
The SAE  report  must  be completed  as thoroughly as possible, including the following:  
• Subject  identification  information  
 
• Event  term  
 
• All available details  about the  SAE  
 
• Causality  of each SAE  
 
• Signature  of the Investigator  
 
Within  24 hours  of awareness  of a new SAE,  the investigative  site will call the Paidion 
Research  Medical  Monitor  (xxxxx)  by calling  the SAE  Hotline  at xxxxx.  The SAE  
Hotline  may be accessed  and is monitored  24 hours/day, 7 days/week.  The 
investigative  site must  also initiate  entry  of the SAE  report  form into  the EDC  system  
being used for this study. The SAE  report  should include  the essential  elements.  
 
The SAE  report  will be forwarded  to the Sponsor  within  the designated  time frames.  If 
additional  information  to complete  the SAE  report  form  is needed,  the Investigator  will 
not wait before  notifying the Paidion Medical  Monitor  of the SAE  via the SAE  Hotline.  
The SAE report form will be updated by the Investigator when additional information 
is received.  
 
10.7 Follow -up of Adverse Events  and Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
After the initial AE or SAE report, the Investigator is required to follow each subject  
until the occurrence of one  of the  following:  
 
• The condition resolves and/or  stabilizes  
 
• The subject is lost to  follow -up 
 
• 30-days after the EOS visit  
DocuSign Envelope ID: E77726CD -B745 -46DC -88B9 -FB9157EEB965  
CONFIDENTIAL  Verrica  Pharmaceuticals  Inc. 
VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  88  
 The appropriate SAE report form will be updated in the EDC after the SAE resolves, 
stabilizes, or is otherwise explained or until the subject is lost to follow -up. The  
Investigator will also ensure that updates include any supplemental data that may  
explain causality  of the  SAE(s).  
 
10.8 Risks  for Women  of Child -bearing  Potential or  During  Pregnancy  
 
The risks of VP -102 application during pregnancy have not been evaluated. Pregnant  
or lactating  females who  are nursing are excluded from  this study.  
 
Female and male subjects must be instructed to inform the Investigator immediately if 
they become pregnant  or genetically  contribute  to a pregnancy  during the study. Should  
study personnel  become aware  of a subject’s  (or subject’s  partner’s) pregnancy,  the site 
personnel  must  report  the pregnancy  to the Sponsor’s  Medical  Monitor  within  24 hours  
by using the pregnancy notification form. The female subject will discontinue study  
drug. The pregnancy will be followed until the outcome is known and will be reported to the  Sponsor.  
 
Pregnancy is not an AE, in and of itself. However, any pregnancy complication or  
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or  
SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered an SAE and will be reported as  
described in the AE and SAE sections. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse  
pregnancy  outcome post -study must be  reported  to the Medical Monitor. 
 
10.9 Special  Safety  Considerations  
 
• Investigators  should confirm  that study drug is completely  dry (2-5 minutes)  before  
applying the surgical tape or allowing the treated areas to come into contact with 
healthy  skin, clothing, furniture, or other surface  areas.  
 
− In addition, an adhesive bandage may be applied over the surgical tape to keep  
it in place on areas that have a high probability of transference to healthy skin, 
mucous  membranes,  or that may experience significant  flexing as in a skin fold. 
 
• VP-102 is considered highly flammable, even after drying. Subjects should avoid  
fire, flame, or smoking until study  drug has been  removed from the skin.

CONFIDENTIAL  Verrica  Pharmaceuticals  Inc. 
VP-102 (Cantharidin)  
VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  89  
 • Cantharidin  has been  shown  to be safe for topical  use, but is highly  toxic  if ingested.  
To deter potential oral ingestion, a bitter compound has been added to the study  
drug. 
 
• Subjects should refrain from sexual activity involving the treated area as well as  
touching, licking, or biting treated skin or putting treated skin in or near any 
mucosal  surface  including the mouth, nostrils,  eyes,  and anogenital  area for at least 
48 hours after treatment  or until the  study drug is removed.  
 
• Subjects are encouraged to wash their hands regularly with soap and water (being  
mindful  to keep  treated  areas  on the hands  dry) and discouraged from  scratching  or 
picking at warts, which  can spread disease

 11.0 ASSESSMENT  OF EFFICACY  
 
11.1 Efficacy  Parameters  
 
Efficacy parameters will be recorded for all enrolled subjects in the Intent -to-Treat  
(ITT) and PP Populations by randomization group. Clinical response to treatment will  
be evaluated at each scheduled visit until EOS by counting all treatable warts. Genital 
warts that develop in areas that are unable to be treated, (e.g., close to a mucous  
membrane)  and other  wart types  (e.g.,  common warts) will not be evaluated,  
documented, or  considered in the  analysi s. 
 
Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint:  
 
• Proportion of subjects exhibiting complete clearance of all treatable warts at the

 12.0 STATISTICAL  METHODS  
 
Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, and study drug exposure  
will be summarized. The data will be summarized in tables, as appropriate, sho wing  
the number of subjects with non- missing data (n), mean, standard deviation, median,  
minimum, and maximum for continuous data and showing counts and percentage for  
categorical  data. Data will also  be listed as deemed appropriate.  
 
Summaries of data fro m subjects enrolled in Part A will be pooled with corresponding 
subjects  in Part B. For  instance,  if one of the two regimens selected  for Part B is the 6- 
hour application  of VP-102, then results  from  subjects  who received  the 6-hour 
application of VP -102 from Part A will be pooled with results from subjects who 
received  the 6 -hour application of  VP-102 from Part B.  
 
An additional set of tables will be generated that summarize subjects from Part A of  
the study who are not used in Part B of the study. Summary statistics for continuous  
variables  and counts  and percentages  for categorial  variables  will be shown by 
treatment. However, due to the limited number of subjects for this set of tables  
(expected  n=6), analyses  to be  carried out will only  be descriptive  in nature. 
 
12.1 Analysis  Populations  
 
• The Intent -to-Treat  (ITT)  Population will  include  all randomized  subjects  
 
• The Safety  Population will include  all randomized  subjects  who receive 
≥ 1 application of  study drug (VP-102 or  placebo)  
 
• The Per -Protocol (PP) Population will include all subjects who receive all planned  
treatments of study drug (e.g., complete up to four treatments within the Day 75 
treatment window or clear before Day 75), had no major protocol violations, and  
were assessed fo r clearance at the  Study Day 84 (–0/+8 days)  EOT  Visit 
 
12.2 Analysis  of Study  Population  and Subject  Characteristics  
 
Subject demographics, efficacy tables, and subject dropout rates will be tabulated at  
the Study Day 84 (EOT) Visit and the Study Day 147 (EOS) Visit. Data will be  
summarized  using descriptive  statistics  (sample size, mean,  median, standard 
deviation, minimum,  maximum)  for continuous  variables  and frequencies,  and 
DocuSign Envelope ID: E77726CD -B745 -46DC -88B9 -FB9157EEB965

VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  93  
 percentages  for discrete  variables.  Corresponding by-subject  data listings  will be 
tabulated.  
 
12.3 Efficacy  Analyses  
 
Efficacy  will be  evaluated in the  ITT and PP Populations by treatment  group. 
 
At the end of the study, Part B tables will be generated that pool subjects from Part A  
and Part B. The regimens included in these tables will be VP -102 Regimen 1, VP -102 
Regimen 2, Placebo Regimen 1, and Placebo Regimen 2 ( Section 6.1.2). For the  
efficacy endpoints ( Section 11.1), summary statistics for continuous variables and 
counts  and percentages  for categorical  variables  will be presented.  In addition, 
statistical comparisons will be carried out to compare VP -102 Regimen 1 to Placebo 
Regimen 1 and VP -102 Regimen 2 to Placebo Regimen 2. Comparisons made within 
Regimen 1 (VP -102 vs Placebo) will be independent of comparisons made within 
Regimen  2. Comparisons  may be carried  across  Regimens;  however,  no formal  
statistical testing  will be carried  out with comparisons  being  considered  only 
observational.  
 
An additional set of tables will be generated that summarize subjects from Part A of  
the study who are not used in Part B of the study. Summary statistics for continuous  
variables  and counts  and percentages  for categorial  variables  will be shown by 
treatment. However, due to the limited number of subjects for this set of tables  
(expected  n=6), analyses  to be carried out will  only be descriptive  in nature. 
 
12.4 Safety  Analyses  
 
Safety  analyses  will be conducted in the Safety  Population by actual  treatment received.  
 
Adverse  events,  including LSRs,  will be coded with the Medical  Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA®) Version  20.0. The number  and percentage of 
subjects  having  TEAEs  will be tabulated  by system  organ class  and MedDRA  preferred  
term with a breakdown by treatment group. A subject -by-subject AEs data listing,  
including verbatim  term,  preferred  term,  treatment,  severity,  location, and causal  
relationship to the study drug will be provided. The number of subjects experiencing 
TEAEs and number of TEAEs will be summarized by tre atment using frequency  
counts.

VP-102-104 Clinical  Protocol  
Page  94  
 Any AE with an onset  date after the EOS  visit will be considered  off study and will not 
be included in tables summaries (although they will appear in AE listings). Each AE  
will be counted only once for a given subject. If the same AE occurs on multiple  
occasions for a subject, the occurrence with the highest severity and relationship to  
study drug will be reported. If two or more AEs are reported as a unit, the individual  
terms  will be  reported  as separate events.  
 
Changes in vital signs  (temperature and heart rate) , from baseline to EOS, will be  
examined. Treatment -emergent changes from normal values to abnormal values will  
be identified.  
 
12.5 Interim  Analysis  
 
No interim analysis  is planned for this study. 
 
12.6 Determination  of Study  Sample  Size 
 
Although no formal power calculations have been performed, it is expected that a  
sample size of 18 subjects in Part A and 90 subjects in Part B, evaluable at the Study  
Day 84 (–0/+8  days)  EOT Visit,  will be infor mative  regarding  wart clearance rates  that 
can support assumptions in subsequent placebo- controlled trials.  
 
12.7 Handling  of Missing,  Unused,  and Spurious  Data  
 
Subjects  who  do not  have  an assessment  of complete  clearance of  all treatable  warts  at 
the EOS visit (Study Day 84) will be considered to have missing data for the primary 
endpoint. The primary  method to handle  missing  data will be to assign  all subjects  with 
missing  complete clearance data as not  having achieved  complete clearance.  
 
In the event a subject requests to be removed from the study due to study- related  
adverse experiences or additional spreading of disease, data will be collected and  
analyzed as a treatment failure and the subject may be replaced. Further discussion of  
how treatment failure will be utilized in analysis will be provided in the Statistical  
Analysis  Plan.  
 
The procedures for handling missing data for other study endpoints will be described  
in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

14.1 Investigator  Information  
 
Investigator information is included in the Investigator’s Brochure, which is updated  
as needed.  
 
14.2 Investigator’s  Study  Files  
 
Documentation about the Investigator and study staff, the IRB, and the institution is  
required before si te initiation. Copies of these documents will be kept on -site in  site-
specific binders  or electronic  folders,  along with the following supplemental  
information:  a list of Investigator’s obligations, the  IB, the clinical protocol and 
amendments, safety information, information about investigational product, the study  
logs, eCRFs,  records  of monitoring activities,  and correspondence  between  Sponsor  or 
Study  Monitor  and the Investigator. Audit  trails  are generated  automatically  for eCRFs.  
The Invest igator  is responsible  for maintaining  audit  trails  of all electronic data systems 
used for  source  documentation. 
 
14.3 Electronic Case  Report  Forms  and Source Documentation  
 
The Investigator  must  make  study data accessible to the Site Monitor, other  authorized  
representatives  of the Sponsor, and the appropriate  regulatory authority inspectors. The 
eCRF  for each  subject  will be  checked  against  source  documents  at the site by the Site 
Monitor, and a final copy of the eCRF will be signed by the Investiga tor with an  
electronic signature and includes an attestation they have reviewed and attest to the  
accuracy of all data recorded in the EDC and any supporting documentation. A copy  
of the final eCRFs will be provided to the Investigator in PDF on computer disc after  
study closure, to be kept  in the Investigator’s study files.  
 
14.4 Retention  of Study  Documents  
 
According to ICH E6 guidance, all eCRFs, as well as supporting paper and electronic  
source  documentation and  administrative  records, must  be retained  by the Investigator  
until at least 2 years following notification that either the appropriate  regulatory 
authority has approved the product  for the indication  under  study, the Sponsor  has 
DocuSign Envelope ID: E77726CD -B745 -46DC -88B9 -FB9157EEB965

 discontinued clinical development of the product, or notification that the marketing 
application  was not approved. 
 
These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the  
applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor. The Sponsor  
is responsibl e for informing the Investigator  and institution  as to when  these documents  
no longer need to be retained. No study documents will be destroyed or moved to a  
new location without prior written approval from the Sponsor. If the Investigator  
relocates,  retires, or withdraws  from  the study for any reason, all records  required to be 
maintained for the study should be transferred to an agreed- upon designee, such as  
another Investigator at the  institution where  the study was conducted.  
 
Audit  trails  for electronic  document  must  be retained  for a period at least as long as the 
period required  for the subject’s  electronic  records  to which  they pertain.  The 
Investigator must retain either the original of the audit trails or a certified copy of the  
audit  trails.  
 
14.5 Confidentiality  
 
14.5.1 Data  
 
The Investigator  must  keep  all information  confidential  about  the nature of the 
proposed investigation provided by the Sponsor or Study Monitor to the Investigator  
(with  the exception of information  required  by law or regulations  to be disclosed  to the 
IRB,  the subject, or the  appropriate regulatory authority). 
 
14.5.2 Subject  Anonymity  
 
The anonymity  of participating  subjects  must  be maintained.  Subjects  will be identified  
by an assigned subject number on eCRFs and other documents retrieved from the site  
or sent to the Study Monitor, Sponsor, regulatory agencies, analysis laboratories, or  
blinded reviewers. Documents that identify the subject (e.g., the signed ICF) must be  
maintained in strict confidence by the Investigator, e xcept to the extent necessary to  
allow auditing by the appropriate regulatory authority, the Study Monitor, or Sponsor  
representatives.

 14.6 Protocol  Compliance  
 
Substantive changes in the protocol include changes that affect the safety of subjects  
or changes that alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study,  
the experimental  design, dosages, assessment  variable(s),  the number  of subjects  
treated, or the subject -selection criteria. Such changes must be prepared a s a protocol  
amendment by the Sponsor and implemented only upon joint approval of the Sponsor  
and the Investigator.  A protocol  amendment  must  receive IRB approval  before  
implementation. In parallel with the IRB approval process, the protocol amendment  
will be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authority as an amendment to the  
regulatory  submission under  which  the study is being conducted.  If a protocol  
amendment requires changes in the ICF, the revised informed consent form prepared  
by the Investigator  must  also be approved by the Sponsor, Study Monitor, and  the IRB 
before  implementation.  
 
In instances  where there is an immediate  risk to a subject  that is deemed  crucial  for the 
safety and well -being of that subject, the Investigator or the attending physician will  
contact the Medical Monitor as soon as possible to make them aware of such a  
departure. These departures do not require preapproval by the IRB; however, the IRB  
and Medical  Monitor  must  be notified  in writing  as soon  as possible  after the departure 
has been  made.  In addition, the Investigator  will document  the reasons  for the protocol  
deviation and the  ensuing events in the subject’s  eCRF.  
 
14.7 Study  Monitor  Functions  and Responsibility  
 
The Study Monitor, in accordance with the Sponsor’s requirements, will ensure that  
the study is conducted and documented properly by carrying  out the activities  outlined  
in ICH E6  guidance.  
 
14.8 General  Information  
 
The Investigator  should  refer to the IB, Instructions  For Use, and any other  information 
provided about  this investigational  product  and details  of the procedures  to be followed  
during this study.

 15.0 DATA HANDLING  AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source 
documents  designed to record all  observations  and other  data pertinent  to the study for 
each study subject. Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be used to capture study assessments and data. The study coordinator or other delegated study personnel will  
enter data from source documents into the eCRFs. All eCRFs will be reviewed and  
source -verified  by the Study Monitor  during periodic  site visits  as well as via 
centralized  monitoring, and  the Study Monitor  will ensure  that all data in the eCRF  are 
correct and complete. All information recorded on the eCRFs for this study must be  
consistent with the source documentation (i.e., medical records). Before or between  
visits, the Medical Monitor or Study Monitor may conduct a preliminary medical  
review  of the eCRFs.  After  the eCRFs  are completed  and source -verified,  the 
Investigator must electronically sign all required pages in the eCRF, verifying the  
accuracy  of all data contained in the eCRF.  
 
Training will be provided for t he EDC system. All study personnel using the EDC  
system  must  have  the necessary  education, training, and experience or any combination  
of these. The Investigator will be responsible for documenting employee education, 
training, and previous experience that  pertain to the EDC system for all site personnel 
using the EDC system.  
 
The Investigator  must  maintain  adequate security  of the EDC  system,  including 
documentation that all users have been trained on the appropriate SOP and a list of  
authorized  users.  To ensure all data entries  can be tracked,  all personnel  responsible  for 
data entry must obtain a unique user identification and password before any data can  
be entered in the eCRFs. Authorized study personnel will be assigned a unique user  
identification  only after receiving  SOP training. 
 
If electronic data systems  other  than those  provided and maintained  by the Sponsor  are 
used for documentation and data capture,  the Investigator  must  ensure  that the systems 
are validated  and that data  are backed  up as described  in Section 14.0.

 16.0 QUALITY CONTROL  AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Written SOPs will be followed to ensure that the study is conducted and data are  
generated,  documented (recorded),  and reported  in compliance with the protocol, GCP,  
and the applicable regulatory requirements. Quality control will be applied to each 
stage of data handling. Regular monitoring, as defined in ICH GCP, Section 1.8, “The  
act of overseeing the progress of a clinical trial, and of ensuring that it is conducted, recorded,  and reported  in accordance with the protocol, SOPs,  GCP,  and the applicable  
regulatory requirement(s)”,  will be  conducted throughout  the conduct  of the study.  
 
The purpose  of monitoring is to verify  that: 
 
• Rights  and well -being of the human subjects are protected  
 
• The reported  study data are accurate,  complete,  and verifiable  from  source  
documents  
 
• The conduct  of the study is in compliance with the currently  approved  
protocol/amendment(s),  with GCP,  and with the applicable  regulatory requirements  
 
• Monitoring  is an integral  role in the quality  control  of a clinical  trial and is designed 
to verify  the quality  of the  study 
 
To fulfill the Quality Assurance requirements of GCP, audits will be conducted to  
assess and assure the reliability and integrity of a study’s quality control systems and  
recognized  standards.  
 
The purpose  of an audit is to:  
 
• Ensure  participant safety  
 
• Assure  compliance  to study protocol  procedures, regulatory requirements,  and 
SOPs  
 
• Assure  data quality

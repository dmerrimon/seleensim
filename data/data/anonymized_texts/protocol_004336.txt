Acute Treatment ofMigraine
Protocol Number:
H8H-CD-LAHL/ COL MIG -305Phase: 3 Indication: Migraine -
Acute Treatment 
Primary Objective :Toevaluate thesafetyandtolerability oflong-term intermittent useoflasmiditan
100mgandoflasmiditan 200mg,asthefirstdose and as asecond dose, for theacute treatment of
migraine.
Secondary Objectives: Toexplore thelong-term efficacy oflasmiditan 100 mgandlasmiditan 200 mg
interms ofheadache response overtime.
Additional Objectives: To compare patient reported resource utilization during the study to patient 
reported information from C OL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302 in terms of cardiovascular ev ents and in terms 
of migraine episodes.
StudyEndpoints
Primary Endpoint: Theproportion ofpatients andtheproportion ofattacks associated withanyadverse
eventandwithspecific adverse events.
Secondary Endpoint :  The proportion ofmigraine attacks treated with lasmiditan 100mgandwith
lasmiditan 200mgwhich respond at2hours , calculated foreach 3month period.
Study Design: 
This is a prospective ,randomized, open -label study in subjects with migraine who hav e completed the 
Phase 3 studies , COL MIG-301 or COL MIG -302. Subjects will be stratified (yes or no) for use of 
concomitant medications that reduce the frequency of migraine episodes.
Subjects will be asked to treat all migraine attacks with study drug on an outpatient basis for up to 
12months. Each patient’s study participation will consist of a screening visit (Visit 1) anda treatment 
period of up to 12 months during which the subje ct will treat all migraine attacks with either lasmiditan 
200 mg or lasmiditan 100 mg (with a second dose of study drug permitted between 2 and 24 hours (h)
for recurrence of migraine only for subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg ). During the treatment
period subjects will return to the clinic at 1, 3,6,9 and 12 months. There will be an early termination (ET) 
visit within two weeks ( 14 days )of treatment discontinuation for all subjects that discontinue between 
scheduled v isits. The End -of-Study (EoS ) visit will be at 12 months or at any scheduled visit when the 
subject’s participation in the study is ended. Participation in the study for 12 months will be defined as 
completing Month12/Visit 6 .
AtScreening /Visit1subjects will provide written informed consent and authorize Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Study eligibility will be assessed on the basis of completing 
study COL MIG-301 or COL MIG -302.  TheEoS/Visit 2 of COL MIG -301 or COL MIG-302 can be the 
same day as Screening/Visit 1.  Assessments required for this visit can be the same assessments 
obtained at theEoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 as long as that visit occurred on the 
same day or no more than twoweeks prior to signing informed consent and HIPAA for participation in 
COL MIG-305 as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).Regardless of the timing of

LY573144 Page 4of 74signing of informed consent for COL MIG-305, m edical history, migraine history and concomi tant 
medication use will be reviewed and any changes or updates since enrolling in COL MIG-301 or COL 
MIG-302 will be noted. All subjects will complete the MIDAS questionnaire.   If Screening/Visit 1 is not 
the same day as EoS/V2 of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 but within 2 weeks, a complete physical 
examination, vital signs and urine pregnancy test will also be done. Subjects that are consented more 
than two weeks afterEoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 will undergo the following 
assessments: acomplete physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (including urine 
pregnancy test on women of child -bearing potential (WOCBP)) and 12 -lead ECG .A Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) will be completed.   All subjects will be randomized and dispensed 
study drug and instructed to use lasmiditan as the first treatment for each migraine attack. Subjects will 
be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, to receive lasmiditan 100 mg (L100 mg) or lasmiditan 200 mg 
(L200 mg). Subjects randomi zed to lasmiditan 100 mgwill be allowed to take a second dose of study 
drug if needed for recurrence of migraine .
Treatment Period: Subjects will be asked to use lasmiditan as the first treatment for each new 
migraine attack within 4 hours of onset providing that the headache sev erity is at least moderate at that 
time and not improving. Subjects should not exceed a total dose of 200 mg o f lasmiditan in a 24-hour 
period. Subjects will record their response to the first dose over the nex t 48 hours using an electronic 
diary. If the migraine respond swithin 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after 
2hours ,a second dose of study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose only for subjects 
randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg. Subjects will record their response to a second dose, taken for 
recurrence, for 48 hours in the electronic diary. The total time for recording response to study drug is 
up to 72 hours depending on whether or not a second dose of study drug is used (for subjects 
randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg ).Subjects using an alternate medication other than a second dose of 
study drug for the treatment of migraine rescue or recurrence will report the use of medication and 
continue to record their response s in the electronic diary up to the 48 hour timepoint.
Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) . At each 
visit a brief physical examination based on adv erse events (AEs), vital signs and a urine pre gnancy test 
on all WOCBP will be obtained . Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory parameters 
(hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis) will be obtained atMonth 1/Visit 2, Month 6/Visit 4and 
Month 12/Visit 6 (EoS/ET).A 12-lead ECG will be obtained atMonth 6/Visit 4and Month 12/Visit 6
(EoS/ET). C-SSRS will be completed at each visit. The MIDAS questionnaire will be completed at 
Month 3/Visit 3, Month6/Visit 4, Month 9/Visit 5and Month 12/Visit 6 (EoS/ET).  At each visit, 
resource utilization, AEs, use of concomitant medication, use of study drug and patient diary compliance 
will be assessed; subjects who are continuing will bedispensed study drug.  Subjects who decide to 
withdraw at a scheduled visit should confirm the date of thevisit is 7days (± 2 days) from their last 
migraine treated with study drug.  Subjects who decide to discontinue between scheduled visits are 
asked to contact the clinic to schedule an ET /Visit 6within two weeks (14 days) after discontinuation of 
dosing .  The total time onstudy is up to54 weeks (a maximum of 378 days) .
Subject Population: Adult patients with a history of migraine who hav e completed COL MIG -301or 
COL MIG -302.  
Number of Subjects:   Approximately 2 580subjects 
(combined from COL MIG -301 and COL MIG -302)
will be enroll ed, with the goal of having a t least 300 
patients dose an av erage of 2 migraines per month 
for 6 months and 100 patients dose an av erage of 2 
migraines per month for 12 months.   Number of Centers :Up to 240 centers in US

Statistical Analysis:
Safety:
Adverse ev ents will be summarized in terms of the proportion of patients and the proportion of attacks 
associated with any adverse ev ent and with specific adverse ev ents. Physical examinations, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis) and EC G parameters will be 
summarized in terms of change from baseline status at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months or early termination.
Efficacy:
This is an open -label study with no control group. Efficacy data will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics. The propo rtion of attacks treated with study medication which respond at 2 hours will be 
calculated for each 3 month period.
Resource Utilization:
Resource utilization such as visits to cardiologists, procedures, hospitalizations, new treatments or 
treatment adjus tments for CV disease as well as visits to the emergency room or a physician’s office for 
the treatment of migraine will be summarized by treatment arm in terms of patient reported information 
recorded in study COL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302 compared to inform ation reported at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and EoS/ET/6.Concomitant medication use for migraine and/or pain and missed days of work and/or 
school or daily activities based on responses to MIDAS questionnaire will be summarized by treatment 
arm.
Sample Size Rationale  
The sample size was chosen to provide an appropriate long -term safety database. It is not based on 
statistical hypothesis.

LY573144 Page 15of 744.INTRODUCTION
Migraine is a common neurological disorder and was ranked by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) in their 2010 Global Burden of Disease survey as one of 7 most debilitating conditions, 
and as the third most common disease in the world among both males and females.[1]
Although the introduction of triptans greatly improved the acute treatment of migraine, a large 
percentage of patients still lack adequate treatment. A recent study by the American Migraine 
Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) concluded that 40% of episodic migraineurs have 
significant unmet need s; the most frequent complaints were headache -related disability (19%) 
and dissatisfaction with current medications (15 %).[2]Inaddition, concerns about cardiovascular
safety are believed to limit the prescription of triptan s to less than 50% of migraineurs in the US .
[3]Hence, there is a significant unmet need for novel migraine therapies with a distinct 
mechanism of action from triptans. One such agent is lasmiditan (COL -144). Unlike any 
approved treatment for acute migraine, lasmiditan selectively targets 5-HT 1Freceptors on 
neurons in the central and peripheral trigeminal system to alleviate migraine, and lacks the 
vasoconstrictor activity inherent withtriptans.  
Lasmiditan is being developed as a novel acute therapy for migraine and to fulfill significant 
unmet needs in migraine patients with risk factors for undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, and 
those who respond poorly to their current prescription medication for acute migraine. The 
current mainstay migraine therapies are chemical analogs of sumatriptan (‘triptans’), developed 
for their potent cranial vasoconstrictor properties .[4]  Triptans are selective 5-HT 1B/1D receptor 
agonists andmediate their vasoconstrictor activity via 5-HT 1Breceptors expressed on vascular 
smooth muscle .[5]Aslarge numbers of patients were exposed to triptans, it was established 
through post-marketing surveillance that their vasoconstrictor mechanism of action also 
conferred a risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events, some fatal.[3] Consistent with their 
common pharmacology, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan and naratript an all 
induced comparable dose -dependent contraction of isolated human coronary arteries .[5,6,7]   
Because of the liability of triptans to cause coronary vasospasm, they are contraindicated in 
patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD), and it is strongly recommended that they 
are notprescribed to patients with risk factors for undiagnosed CAD (e.g., hypertension,
hypercholesterol emia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with
surgical or physiological menopause, male over 40 years of age) without first undergoing a
thorough cardiovascular evaluation. 
Treatment of migraineurs with known cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors is
particularly challenging because the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, claudication,
diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are all higher in individuals with migraine
compared with the general population .[8]Many migraineurs who were previously eligible for 
triptan therapy may become ineligible as they age and develop cardiovascular disease and/or 
associated risk factors. For these patients, there is a pressing need for an effective migraine 
therapy with a non -vascular mechanism of action.
This study is a Phase 3 multicenter study in subjects with acute migraine .The study is designed 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term intermittent useoflasm iditan 200 mg and 
lasmiditan 100 mg given as a first dose for the treatment of a migraine attack .  Asecond dose of 
study drug is allowed to investigate the safety of lasmiditan 200 mg and lasmiditan 100 mg 
when taken for rescue or when taken for recurrence of migraine . In addition to safety 
assessments, the efficacy of long term intermittent use of lasmiditan will be evaluated. Data 
from this study will be used to further investigate and confirm the safety and efficacy of

disease.
4.1Background
Lasmiditan is a highly selective and potent 5 -HT 1Freceptor agonist with > 470-fold higher affinity 
(Ki2.21 nM) for the 5-HT 1Freceptor than for 5-HT 1B/1D receptors in radioligand binding assays.  
Based on activation of G proteins, the agonist efficacy of lasmiditan at the 5-HT 1Freceptor was 
~80% that of 5-HT.  Lasmiditan is a pyridinoylpiperidine derivative, structurally unrelated to 
existing migraine therapies.  Lasmiditan (1 µM) was examined for its binding affinity at more 
than 50other GPCRs, ion channels, and transporter sites, and had no significant affinities 
except at the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA Achannel (Ki0.29 µM).  Unlike
diazep am, lasmiditan did not potentiate GABA currents in a human cloned GABA Achannel 
functional assay, and hence this binding affinity was not considered to be biologically relevant. 
In rodent models of migraine, selective 5-HT 1F receptor agonists inhibited trigeminal nociceptive 
processing without affecting blood vessel tone.[9,10,11]  Unlike triptans, lasmiditan did not constrict 
rabbit saphenous vein,[9]an assay predictive of human coronary artery constriction.[12]  
Lasmiditan is under development as a neurally acting treatment for migraine without the 
vasoconstrictor liability of triptans .
4.2Clinical Studies to Date
Five Phase 1 studies have been completed in Europe using intravenous (IV), sublingual, and 
oral formulations of lasmiditan .  Two European Phase 2 studies have been completed with 
lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine. 
Lasmiditan was well tolerated in healthy volunteers following 20 minute IV infusions at dose 
levels of 0.1 to 20 mg with few AEs reported (clinical study H8H-BD-LACA ).  There was a clear 
increase in the number of AEs reported following 20minute IV infusions of 30 and 60 mg of 
lasmiditan, although most were rated as mild.  The number of AEs reported following 60 mg of 
lasmiditan decreased significantly when the rate of infusion was reduced from 3 to 1 mL/min 
and the infusion time was increased to 60minutes, although the number of subjects reporting 
AEs was similar.  All subjects receiving 60 minute IV infusions of 120 and 180 mg of lasmiditan 
reported AEs with a similar overall frequency at each dose level.  The majori ty of AEs were mild 
in severity at all dose levels although there was a dose -related increase in the number of 
moderate AEs reported, with the highest incidence recorded at the two highest dose levels (120 
and 180 mg of lasmiditan). The most frequently reported AEs considered to be related to the 
study drug were somnolence, paresthesia, dizziness and hot flushes.  These occurred with 
rapid onset, generally within 10minutes of the start of the infusion at all dose levels.  Adverse 
events typical for the triptans such as chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure, neck pain or 
stiffness were not reported, even after the highest dose of 180 mg was administered.
A Phase 2, placebo -controlled clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous 
lasm iditan in the acute treatment of migraine has been completed (clinical study COL MIG -201).  
This study was blinded with regard to dose and treatment allocation and employed doses of 
lasmiditan from 2.5 to 45 mg IV infused over 20 minutes.  One hundred and thirty (130) patients 
were treated in the study and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.  The only AE 
that was clearly dose related was paresthesia; however, most of these events were reported as

LY573144 Page 17of 74mild.  Lasmiditan given by the IV route was effec tive in the acute treatment of migraine in this 
study, showing a statistically significant dose -response relationship.
A Phase 1 placebo -controlled study assessed the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profile of sublingual and oral lasmidit an (clinical study COL MIG-102).  The sublingual 
route of administration was investigated using ascending single doses from 1 to 32 mg 
lasmiditan versus placebo in healthy subjects in one study arm.  In a second study arm, single 
ascending oral doses of a solution formulation from 25 to 400 mg lasmiditan or placebo were 
administered to healthy subjects.  In a third arm of the study, the safety and tolerability of 100 
mg and 400 mg of the oral solution formulation were evaluated in an additional cohort of 
subjects.  The tolerability of both the oral and sublingual route of administration was good.  
However, the sublingual route did not show any advantage in comparison to the oral route of 
administration since there was no evidence of enhanced bioavailability in terms of exposure 
(Cmax, AUC 0–t) or time to peak concentration (tmax).  The oral route of administration was 
therefore selected for further study.  Oral doses of the solution formulation were generally well 
tolerated up to the maximum dose tested of 400 mg lasmiditan.  There were no clinically 
significant changes in safety parameters or clinical laboratory results. 
The assessment of bioequivalence of the oral solution and tablet formulations of 200 mg 
lasmiditan and of dose linearity of ascending doses of 50, 200 and 400 mg lasmiditan of a tablet 
formulation were investigated in a further clinical Phase 1 study (clinical study COL MIG-103), 
including also the assessment of safety and tolerability.  In general, lasmiditan was well 
tolerated across all doses.  The most common AEs across all doses with a dose -related 
increase in frequency were fatigue and dizziness followed by somnolence and paresthesia.
In the Thorough QT study (clinical study COL MIG-105) which was designed, performed and 
analyzed in accordance with the ICH E14 guidance ,[13]the primary objective was to assess the 
effect of 100 mg lasmiditan and 400 mg lasmiditan on cardiac de-and re-polarization. The 
statistical evaluation of the primary variable revealed that lasmiditan caused no significant QT 
prolongation either at 100 mg or at 400 mg.  The results met the criteria for a negative thorough 
QT/QTc study according to ICH E14 .[13]
The bioavailability of lasmiditan 200mg administered orally as a tablet formulation under fed 
and fasted conditions was investigated (clinical study COL MIG-104). A slight delay in the time 
to reach maximum plasma concentration was observed in the fed state. As in other Phase 1 
studies, lasmiditan was well tolerated. The most common AEs across both conditions were 
somnolence, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension (with and without dizziness) and paresthesia .
The efficacy of oral lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine was evaluated in a Phase 2 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group dose -ranging study conducted in five European 
countries (clinical study COL MIG -202).  A total of 391 subjects treated a single migraine attack 
at home using one of four doses of lasmiditan (50, 100, 200 or 400 mg) or placebo.  The 
proportion of patients with headache relief (moderate or severe headache becoming mild or 
none) or who were pain free showed statistically significant dose responses at 2 hours after 
treatment. Associated symptoms such as nausea, phonophobia and photophobia also 
responded to lasmiditan.  There were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory 
parameters, ECGs or vita l signs.
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 22% of the subjects receiving 
placebo and by 65, 73, 86 and 84% of subjects receiving 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg lasmiditan,

LY573144 Page 18of 74respectively.  The most common adverse events seen in the lasmidi tan groups were related to 
the nervous system.  These included dizziness, fatigue, vertigo, somnolence and paresthesia .  
Chest symptoms characteristic of triptan use were rare and occurred with a similar frequency in 
the placebo and active groups .
During the clinical development of lasmiditan there were no deaths and no subjects were 
withdrawn due to adverse events.  One serious adverse event (SAE)of moderate dizziness 
leading to overnight hospitalization was reported in the oral dose -ranging study.  Thisoccurred 
in a female patient given 200 mg lasmiditan , and resolved without sequelae.
More details on the preclinical and clinical experience with lasmiditan are given in the Clinical 
Investigator’s Brochure.[14]
4.3Minimization of Risk
The dose levels of lasmiditan ( 100 mg and 200 mg) have previously been tested and shown to 
be safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects and in patient swith acute migraine , including in 
Phase 3 stud iesCOL MIG -301and COL MIG -302.
All doses of lasmiditan were associated with driving impairment in a study of healthy volunteers 
on a computer -based driving simulator. Patients should restrict their driving, operation of heavy
machinery, or other similar activities after taking study drug,as described in the informed 
consent form (ICF).
Rescue medication (other than study drug) will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour 
assessments if the migraine does not respond (subj ect is not headache pain free).  
For subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg, if the migraine responds within 2 hours 
(headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after 2 hours , a second dose of study drug may 
be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose.
To insure standardization ,all adverse events will be assessed using WHO Toxicity Criteria 
(Appendix 1).
4.4Potential Benefit
Migraine is a common disorder with a prevalence of 11.7% (17.1% of women and 5.4% of men)
based on a large population survey of US households. Nearly a third of sufferers experience
three or more migraine attacks a month, and over half report that the attacks cause severe
disability or require bedrest.[15]Despite the functional impairment caused by the disease, it is 
estimated that less than half of all migraine ursuse prescription medication to manage their 
disease, indicating a substantial unmet medical need . [16]
In the completed Phase 2 studies, lasmiditan was effective in alleviating migraine attacks when 
given by the IVor oral routes of administration .This study will recruit patients meeting the 
internationally recognized diagnostic criteria for migraine set by the International Headache 
Society (IHS) who complete Phase 3 studies COL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302.

LY573144 Page 19of 744.5Dose Rationale
The dose levels of lasmid itanto be used in this study (100 mg and 200 mg) have been tested 
and shown to be safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and in patients with acute 
migraine ,including in Phase 3 studiesCOL MIG-301 and COL MIG- 302. This study will further 
evaluate the safety and efficacy ofthe long-term intermittent use oflasmiditan 100 mg and 
200mg.  
The allowance of a second dose of either lasmiditan 100 mg or 200 mg for t reatment of rescue 
or recurrence of migraine is to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of a second dose of 
lasmiditan and establish the dosing profile for the use of lasmiditan in the treatment of acute 
migraine.
4.6Conduct of the Study
This study will be conducted according to the protocol and in complianc e with current principles 
of Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). Further 
information on the ethical conduct of the study is in Section 13.
5.TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE
5.1Primary objective
Toevaluate thesafety andtolerability oflong-term intermittent useoflasmiditan 100mgandof
lasmiditan 200mg,asthefirst and asasecond dose, intheacute treatment ofmigraine.
5.2Secondary objectives
Toexplore thelong-term efficacy oflasmiditan 100 mgand lasmiditan 200 mginterms of
headache response over time.
5.3Additional Objectives
To compare patient reported resource utilization during the study to patient reported information 
from COL MIG -301 or COL MIG- 302 in terms of cardiovascular events and in terms of migraine 
episodes.
5.4Overall Study Design and Plan: Description
This isaprospective, randomized, open -label study insubjects with migraine who have
completed CoLucid Phase 3 study, COL MIG-301orCOL MIG-302. Subjects will be stratified (yes 
or no) for use of concomitant medications that reduce the frequency of migraine episodes.
Subjects willbeasked totreat allmigraine attacks with study drug on an outpatient basis for
upto12months. Each patient’s study participation willconsist of a screening visit (Visit 1) and 
a treatment period of up to 12 months during which the subject willtreat all migraine attacks
with either lasmiditan 200 mgorlasmiditan 100 mg (with asecond dose of study drug
permitted between 2and 24 hours (h)forrecurrence ofmigraine only for subjects 
randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg). During the treatment period subjects will return to the clinic 
at 1,3,6,9 and 12 months. There will be an early termination (ET) visit within two weeks

LY573144 Page 20of 74(14days) of treatme nt discontinuation for all subjects that discontinue between scheduled visits. 
The End-of-Study (EoS) visit will be at 12 months or at any scheduled visit when the subject’s 
participation in the study is ended. Participation in the study for 12 months willbe defined as 
completing Month 12/Visit 6 .
AtScreening /Visit 1subjects willprovide written informed consent and authorize Health
Insurance Portability andAccountability Act(HIPAA). Study eligibility willbeassessed onthe
basis ofcompleting study COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302.  The EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 
or COL MIG-302 can be the same day as Screening/Visit 1.  Assessments required forthis
visit canbethesame assessments obtained attheEoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-
302 aslong asthat visit occurred on the same day ornomore than two weeks prior to
signing informed consent and HIPAA forparticipation inCOL MIG-305 as outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Regardless of the timing of signing of informed consent for 
COL MIG-305, medical history, migraine history and concomitant medication use will be 
reviewed and any changes or updates since enrolling in COL MIG- 301 or COL MIG -302 will be 
noted. All subjects will complete the MIDAS questionnaire.  If Screening/Visit 1 is not the same 
day as EoS/V2 of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 but within 2 weeks, a complete physical 
examination, vital signs and urine pregnancy test will also be done.  Subjects that are 
consented more than two weeks after EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 will 
undergo the following assessments: acomplete physical examination, vital signs, clinical
laboratory tests (including urine pregnancy test on women of child -bearing potential (WOCBP))
and12-lead ECG. AColumbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) willbecompleted .  All 
subjects willberandomized anddispensed study drug and instructed touse lasmiditan as
thefirst treatment foreach new migraine attack. Subjects willberandomly assigned ina
1:1ratio, toreceive lasmiditan 100mg(L100 mg)orlasmiditan 200mg(L200 mg). Subjects
randomized to lasmiditan 100 mgwill be allowed to take a second dose of study drug if
needed forrecurrence ofmigraine.
Treatment Period: Subjects will be asked to use lasmiditan as the first treatment for each new 
migraine attack within 4 hours of onset providing that the headache severity is at least moderate
at that time and not improving. Subjects will record their response to the first dose over the next 
48 hours using an electronic diary. For subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg, if the 
migraine does respond within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after 2 
hours, a second dose of study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose. Subjects 
should not exceed a total dose of 200 mg of lasmiditan in a 24 -hour period. Subjects will record 
their response to a second dose, taken for recurrence, for 48 hours in the electronic diary. The 
total time for recording response to study drug is u p to 72 hours depending on whether or not a 
second dose of lasmiditan 100 mgis used. Subjects using an alternate medication other than a 
second dose of lasmiditan 100 mgfor the treatment of migraine rescue or recurrence will report 
the use of medication and continue to record their responses in the electronic diary up to the 48 
hour timepoint.
Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 (Visits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). 
At each visit a brief physical examination based on adverse events (AEs), vital signs and a urine 
pregnancy test on all WOCBP will be obtained.  Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory 
parameters (hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis) will be obtained at Month 1/Visit 2,

For subjects who are lost to follow -up (i.e., those subjects whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the Investigator should 
show “due diligence” by documenting in the source documents all steps taken to contact the 
subject, e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc.
All subjects discontinuing from the trial before a scheduled visit regardles s of cause, must be 
seen for ET/Visit 6for safety assessments and to return all unused study drug and the e -diary .  
Subjects that withdraw f rom the study prior to dosing a migraine attack should return to the clinic 
for ET/Visit 6to return all unused study drug and the e -diary .Subjects that desire to withdraw 
from the study at one of the scheduled visits ( Visit 2, 3, 4 or 5) should complete the EoS/Visit 6
study assessments and return all unused study drug and the e -diary.
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study for any reason will not be replaced .

8.5Administration
Subjects will be screened outside a migraine attack .  Thestudy drug willbe dispensed to the 
subject at each visit with instructions to treat all acute migraine attacks as follows:
Screening/Visit 1 , subjects will receive a single blister card containing 8 tablets.  
Month 1/Visit 2subjects continuing on study may receive a single blister card 
containing 8 tablets or a patient carton containing two dosing cards of 8 tablets each.  
At each subsequent visit (Visits 3, 4and 5/Months 3, 6 and 9 ) subjects may receive a 
single blister card containing 8 tablets or a patient carton containing two dosing cards of 
8 tablets each or a patient carton containing 3 dosing cards of 8 tablets each.  
Subjects are to return all dosing cards (used and unused to each visit).  Additional single 
dosing cards of 8 tablets are available in the event more study drug is needed to treat 
migraines during the time between visits or if a subject loses a dosing card or needs a dosing 
card replaced. Subject use will be monitored to control for medication overuse.
Subjects will be instructed to take one tablet with approximately 4 ounces of water as the 
FIRST treatment for a new migraine attack providing that :any aura symptoms have resolved
the headache is either moderate or severe and has been so for less than 4 hours
no prior analgesic or acute migraine treatment has been taken to treat the current 
migraine attack.
Subjects will be instructed to take a second dose (one tablet ) of study drug (only for those 
subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg ), if needed ,with approximately 4 ounces of water for 
recurrence of migraine at least 2 hours after the first dose .  Subjects should not exceed a total
dose of 200 mg of lasmiditan in a 24 -hour period .
Subjects will be instructed to treat all migraines with lasmiditan as the first treatment for each 
new migraine attack within 4 hours of onset.

Under supervision of the Investigator ,the study pharmacist or designee will be responsible for 
drug accountability. The pharmacist or designee will keep an accurate inventory of test article(s) 
and dispensing using a drug dispensing log. The pharmacist or designee must keep study drug 
inventory available for inspection by the Sponsor, an agent for the Sponsor, and regulatory 
authorities. 
Subjects will be required to return all unused study drug and all empty dosing cards . Ifany 
unused material is remaining at the site at study completion, the pharmacy will be instructed 
how todispose of orreturn the material to the Sponsor after the Sponsor’s representative has 
performed accountability. The Sponsor’s representative will complete authorization forms for 
disposal or return with the responsible pharmacist or designee. Copies of these forms should be 
included with the returned material. The original form should be maintained in the pharmacy 
within the site study files.
9.TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS
9.1Safetyand Efficacy Parameters
Safety will be monitored with physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory 
testing, and AE/SAE assessments. 
Efficacy will be evaluated using subject recorded response to relief from pain andfrom the MBS
(nausea , phonophobia or photophobia )based on the first dose, as well as use of rescue 
medication and/or recurrence of headache and use of medication for recurrence of migraine . 
Efficacy of a second dose will be evaluated using subject recorded response to relief from pain
and from the MBS (nausea , phonophobia or photophobia )bysubjects who took a second dose 
for rescue or for recurrence. Standardization of data capture is provided in detail in the 
remainder of this section .  Assessments should be performed in relation to dosing asindicated .
9.1.1Medical History
During Screening/Visit 1general medical history recorded for participation in COL MIG-301 or 
COL MIG-302 will be reviewed. Information previously recorded will be carried over into the 
database for COL MIG-305.  Any changes or updates to a patient ’s medical history from 
information recorded for participation in COL MIG-301 or COL MIG -302 will be recorded on the 
CRF and will include information relating to any prior or existing medical conditions involving the 
following disease types or systems: infectious diseases, allergic, metabolic/endocrine/nutritional, 
hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT ), 
breasts, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/hepatic, genitourinary/renal, neurological, 
and psychiatric/psychosocial. 
Concomitant medications or devices , for migraine or pain, and any other medication for other 
medical conditions will also be reviewe d. Information previously recorded will be carried over 
into the database for COL MIG-305. Any changes from information recorded for and during 
participation in COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 will be recorded on the CRF. At each visit, the 
use of any concomitant medications will be reviewed and updated for any changes in frequency 
or dosing.

LY573144 Page 31of 74In additio n, any additional information since participation in COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302
regarding the subject’s migraine history including prior treatment will be recorded.   
9.1.1.1 Demographics
During Screening /Visit 1, subject initials, age, and date of birth will be recorded on the CRF.  
Gender, race and ethnicity will be carried over into the database from the information recorded 
for COL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302.
9.1.1.2 MIDAS
MIDAS is a 5 item questionnaire (Appendix 2) evaluating the impact of migraine on a patient’s 
life over the past 3 months. The questionnaire is to be completed by each subject at 
Screening/ Visit 1, Month 3/Visit 3, Month 6/Visit 4, Month 9/Visit 5and Month 12/Visit 6/
EoS/ET.
Subjects should be given sufficient time to complete the questionnaire and it should be 
completed prior to any procedures (i.e. physical exam, blood draw).  The questionnaire is a 
self-reported measure and is to be reviewed with the subject for completeness only.  Subjects 
shou ld not be questioned about any of the responses or given suggestions on how to answer 
any of the questions, however clarification of what a question is asking is allowed.
9.1.1.3 Resource Utilization
During Screening/Visit 1subject information reported during participation in Phase 3 study 
COL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302about any CV events and/or related resource utilization such as 
visits to cardiologists, procedures, hospitalizations, new treatments or treatment adjustments for 
CV disease will be reviewed and updated as appropriate . In addition the previously reported 
information regarding any ER visits or visit to physician’s office for migraine treatment will be 
reviewed and updated. The information recorded for COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 will be 
carried over into the database for the COL MIG-305. At each visit, Month 1/Visit 2, Month 
3/Visit 3 , Month 6/Visit 4 , Month 9/Visit 5 and Month 12/Visit 6 /EoS/ETthe subject will again 
be asked about resource utilization during their time on study.
9.1.2Physical Examination
If EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 is the same day as Screening/Visit 1, only a 
brief physical examination if indicated by an AE will be per formed (as required by the earlier 
studies).  If the subject is not enrolling in COL MIG-305 the same day they are completing COL 
MIG-301 or COL MIG-302, acomplete physical examination will be performed during 
Screening /Visit1. A complete physical examination of all body systems will include the 
following: general appearance, skin, HEEN T, heart, lymph nodes, lungs, abdomen, 
extremities/joints, neurological systems, and mental status. At each visit, Month 1/Visit 2, 
Month 3/Visit 3, Month 6/Visit 4, Month 9/Visit 5and Month 12/Visit 6/EoS/ET, abrief 
symptom related physical examination will be performed if indicated by an AE.
Weight will be measured at Screening /Visit 1 .BMI will be calculated by the database using the 
subject’s height recorded for COL MIG-301 or COL M IG-302.  Weight will also be measured at 
Month 12/Visit 6 /EoS/ET.
9.1.3Vital Signs
Vital signs , measured after at least 5 minutes rest, will include seated systolic blood pressure 
(SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) andheart rate (HR) .All vital sign measurements will be

LY573144 Page 32of 74performed by appropriately qualified and autho rized study personnel, using appropriate 
equipment. 
Blood pressure (BP) will be measured after at least 5 minutes restandif possible in the same 
arm at each visit by using an automated sphygmomanometer. The results will be recorded in 
millimeters of me rcury (mmHg). HR will be measured in the radial artery in the dominant arm for 
30 seconds and will be recorded as beats per minute (bpm). 
Vital signs will be assessed at Screening/Visit 1and at Month 1/Visit 2, Month 3/Visit 3, 
Month 6/Visit 4, Month 9/Visit 5and Month 12/Visit 6/EoS/ET.  If Screening/Visit 1 is the 
same day as EoS/Visit 2 of COL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302 the vital signs obtained will be used 
for both studies.
9.1.4ECG
A standard, digital 12 -lead ECG will be obtained after at least 5 m inutes rest at Screening /Visit
1(ONLY if more than two weeks since EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302) and at 
visitMonth 6/Visit 4, and Month 12/Visit 6/EoS/ET.  If Screening /Visit 1 is the same day or 
within 2 weeks of EoS/Visit 2 of COL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302, the data obtained will be used 
for both studies.
A trained ECG technician will perform the ECGsand all ECG results must be reviewed at the 
site by the Investigator or a medically qualified designee for clinical management of the subject. 
Abnormal findings will be identified as either clinically significant (CS), or not clinically significant 
(NCS). CS findings are to be reported as AEs by the Investigator. ECGs will be sent to a central 
reader for further evaluation.   
ECG reports from the central reader will include: rhythm, rate, axis, PR ,QRS, and corrected (by 
both Fridericia and Bazett) and uncorrected QT interval s.
9.1.5Clinical Laboratory
Sample sof blood and urine will be collected for clinical laboratory tests during Screening /Visit
1(ONLY if more than two weeks since EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302) and at 
visitMonth 1/Visit 2,Month 6/Visit 4, and Month 12/Visit 6/EoS/ET. If Screening /Visit 1 is 
the same daythe data will be used for both studies.  If Screening/Visit is within 2 weeks of 
EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 or COL MIG-302 the data obtained will be used for both studies 
except aurine pregnancy test for WOC BP will be performed. Tests will be conducted as 
designated below: 
9.1.5.1 Clinical Laboratory tests conducted
Clinical laboratory evaluations will include:
Hematology:  white blood cell (WBC) count with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, 
eosinophils, monocytes, basophils ), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and red blood cell 
(RBC) count.  
Serum Chemistry Profile:  albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, chloride, 
bicarbonate, creatinine, glucose, phosphate, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, total protein , 
total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides .

LY573144 Page 33of 74Urinalysis:  protein, glucose, nitrite, ketones, blood (hemoglobin), pH, specific gravity, 
microscopic bacteria, RBCs, WBCs, casts, crystals, and cells. Microscopic examination of 
sediment will be performed only if the results of the urinalysis dipstick evaluation are positive.
For WOCBP, a urine pregnancy test for β-HCG will be performed at the Screening /Visit 1
(test will count for EoS/Visit 2for COL M IG-301 or COL MIG -302 i f visit is same day) .  A urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at each visit. If a urine pregnancy test is positive during the 
study the subject will be discontinued from the study after confirmation with a positive serum 
βHCG .A subject with a positive urine βHCG must not be dosed unless a negative serum βHCG 
is obtained. The confirmatory serum test may be performed at the local clinical laboratory.
9.1.5.2 Abnormal and Clinically Significa nt Results
The Investigator must categorize all abnormal hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis laboratory 
values as either CS orNCS. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in laboratory 
parameters, which has medical consequences that result in an alteration in the subject’s 
medical care. The Investigator will use the WHO Toxicity Criteria (see Appendix 1) as a guide 
when evaluating the clinical significance of all abnormal clinical laboratory results. In case of 
CS laboratory results, the Investigator will continue to monitor the subject with additional 
laboratory assessments until (1) values have reached normal range and/or baseline levels, or 
(2) the Investigator has judged that the abnormal values are not related to the administration of 
study drug or other protocol -specific procedures.
9.1.5.3 Hepatic Safety Monitoring
If a study subject experiences elevated ALT ≥3X ULN, AST ≥3X ULN, ALP ≥2X ULN, or 
elevated TBL ≥2X ULN, liver testing (Appendix 5) should be repeated within 3 to 5days 
including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and creatine 
kinase to confirm the abnormality and to determine if it is increasing or decreasin g.  If the 
abnormality persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring should be initiated by the 
investigator and in consultation with the study medical monitor.  Monitoring of ALT, AST, TBL, 
and ALP should continue until levels normalize or retur n to approximate baseline levels. 
Hepatic Safety Data Collection
Additional safety data should be collected if 1 or more of the following conditions occur: 
Elevation of serum ALT to ≥5X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests
Elevation of serum AST to ≥5X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests
Elevated serum TBL to ≥ 2X ULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndrome) 
Elevation of serum ALP to ≥2X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests
Subject discontinued from treatment due to a hepatic event or abnormality of liver tests
Hepatic event considered to be a SAE
9.1.6Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
C-SSRS is a suicidal ideation rating scale that rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation 
on a scale, ranging from "wish to be dead" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent”. The scale intends to prospectively identify and classify suicidal ideation and behavior 
based on a semi -structured interview by the Investigator or designee trained in administering 
the questionnaire.  
If Screening /Visit 1 is the same day or within 2 weeks of EoS/Visit 2of COL MIG-301 
or COL MIG -302 the data obtained will be used for both studies.

LY573144 Page 34of 74The “since last visit” version will be administered at Screening/Visit 1(ONLY if more 
than two weeks since EoS/Visit 2 of COL MIG -301 or COL MIG -302) and at visit Month
1/Visit 2, Month 3/Visit 3, Month 6/Visit 4, Month 9/Visit 5and Month 12/Visit 6/
EoS/ET.  (Appendix 3).  
If present, suicide ideation will be classified in  5 classes (1 -5), the intensity of suicidal ideation 
will be classified in 5 dimensions, and any suicidal behavior will be classified in 6 classes (actual 
attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts towards and attempt, suicidal 
behavior, suicide).
9.1.7Dosing Instructions
Study drug should be administered as the FIRST treatm ent for an acute migraine attack. If the 
subject has already taken any prior analgesic or acute migraine treatment, he/she is no longer 
eligible to treat the current migraine attack but may treat a later attack with the study drug.
Subjects should treat a ll migraines with study drug.
Subjects will be asked to treat each migraine attack within 4 hours of onset providing that the 
headache severity is at least moderate at that time and not improving. Subjects will record their 
response over the next 48 hours using an electronic diary. Subjects should not exceed a total 
dose of 200 mg of lasmiditan in a 24-hour period. Subjects will be instructed not to use rescue 
medication (other than study drug) until at least 2 hours after taking study drug. If the subject 
does not become headache pain free within 2 hours, rescue medication (other than study drug)
will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour assessments. TheInvestigator will advise each 
subject as to alternative suitable rescue medication. Triptans, ergots , opioids and barbi turates
MUST NOT be used for rescue medication within 24 hours of study drug administration. For 
subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg,if the migraine responds within 2 hours (headache 
becomes pain free) but then rec ursafter 2 hours ,a second dose of study drug may be taken for 
up to 24 hours from the first dose.
9.1.8Subject Diary
Subjects will be trained on the use of the electronic diary at Screening/Visit 1 . Efficacy data will 
be collected in an electronic diary for an attack.  Subjects will record the date and time at which 
each migraine headache starts and when it first becomes moderate or severe .  They will also 
record the date and time of taking the first dose of study drug.  All migraines treated with study 
drug will be recorded in the diary.
For each migraine, subjects will be asked to assess their headache severity at specified time
points: 0 (pre dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 4,and 24 and 48 hours post dose using the IHS four point
headache severity rating scale (0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe 
pain). The need for an alternative treatment as rescue medication will be assessed between 2 
and 24 hoursand at 48 hours .  Recurrence ofpain and second dosing ofstudy drug (only for 
those randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg)will be assessed between 2 and 24 hours and at 48 
hours.
Atthe same time points, specified above ,subjects will grade the degree ofinterference with 
normal activities and the presence or absence (yes or no) of accompanying symptoms: 
photophobia, phonophobia and nausea . At time 0 (pre dose) subjects will select from the
accompanying symptoms present (nausea, phon ophobia or pho tophobia) which one is the most 
bothersome to them .Subjects will be asked to record the presence or absence (yes or no) of 
vomiting. Subjects will also be asked to record the exact time at which headache relief became

will be asked to record their global impression of change using a 7-point scale (very much 
better, much better, alittle better, nochange, alittle worse, much worse, and very much 
worse).
The diary will also be used to record any symptoms or side effects the subject is experiencing 
and the use of any concomitant medications.   The diary is to be completed for the duration of a 
subject’s participation in the study. 
9.1.8.1 Recording Use of Rescue Medication and Migraine Symptoms
Any use of a rescue medication (other than study drug) taken because headache pain free dom
is not achieved at 2 hours will be recorded .Subjects will document the date and time of dosing 
for rescue and any migraine symptoms they are experiencing at time of dosing and at time 
points specified above .  Migraine pain will be graded as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or 
severe (3) and other symptoms ( nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia) will be recorded as yes 
or no.At time 0 (pre dose) subjects will select from the accom panying symptoms present 
(nausea, phonophobia or photophobia) which one is the most bothersome to them. Subjects 
will be asked to record the presence or absence (yes or no) of vomiting. Subjects willalso be
asked torecord the exact time atwhich headache reliefbecame meaningful to them and the 
time atwhich they become headache pain free. 
9.1.8.2 Recording Recurrence and Migraine Symptoms
Ifmigraine recurs within 48 hou rsofdosing,thesubject willnote theexact time when the
headache returns tomild, moderate, or severe intensity after being pain free. For subjects 
randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg, subjects willdocument thetime they take thesecond 
dose of study drug and anymigraine symptoms they are experienc ing at the time of dosing 
and at time points specified above .Migraine pain will be graded as none (0), mild (1), 
moderate (2), or severe (3)and other symptoms (nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia) will 
be recorded as yes or no.  At time 0 (pre dose) subjects will select from the accompanying 
symptoms present (nausea, phonophobia or photophobia) which one is the most bothersome 
to them. Subjects will be asked to record the presence or absence (yes or no) of vomiting. 
Subjects willalso beasked torecord the exact time atwhich headache reliefbecame
meaningful to them and the time atwhich they become headache pain free. 
9.2Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
9.2.1Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any undesirable physical, psychological, or behavioral effect experienced 
by a subject during his/her participation in an investigational study, in conjunction with the use of 
the drug, whether or not product -related. During the treatment of a migrain e with study drug 
subjects will be asked if they are feeling anything unusual that they have not felt with a migraine 
before. A ‘yes’ response will trigger an alert to the site to contact the subject and assess the AE
in terms of what the subject is exper iencing, how long the symptoms lasted and how much the 
symptom(s) impacted them. During the time between dosing, subjects will be asked how they 
are feeling. A response of ‘not well’ will trigger an alert to the site to contact the subject and 
assess the AE similarly to the assessment of AEs reported during treatment.  The occurrence of 
AEs should also be reviewed by non-directive questioning of the subject at each visit in the 
study.  AEs may include, but are not limited to :
•Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by the subject and/or observed by 
the Investigator or medical staff, and

LY573144 Page 36of 74•Changes in laboratory abnormalities that are clinically relevant as assessed by the 
Investigator and for which a medical intervention wa s initiated. 
Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing prior to the use of 
the product are not considered AEs after treatment unless they reoccur after the subject has 
recovered from the pre-existing condition or, in the opinion of the Investigator; they represent a 
clinically significant exacerbation in intensity or frequency. AEs are collected from the time the 
subject signs the informed consent form until the completion of EoS/ET/Visit 6.  AEs reported 
prior todosing willbe captured and considered non-treatment emergent AEs. AEsreported 48 
hours after dosing a migraine and between migraines will be captured and considered non-
treatment emergent AEs.   
All AEs must be recorded in the site’s study records and the AE CRF with the following 
information:
1.Relationship to Study Drug :  The Investigator must assess whether they consider anAE to 
bedrug-related. In assessing this relationship, the Investigator must use information about 
the drug as outlined in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), the subject’s pre-existent medical 
conditions/concurrent medication, and chronology of the event relative to drug 
administration. The following definitions will be used:
Reasonably or possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are considered by the Investigator (or 
other qualified physician ) to have at least a possible relationship to study drug.
Not reasonably or not possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful 
medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are considered by the 
Investigator (or other qualified physician ) to have no relationship, or no reasonable 
possibility of a r elationship, to study drug.
2.Event Severity:  The Investigator will be asked to assess the severity of the AE using the 
WHO Toxicity Criteria, as shown in Appendix 1. The WHO criteria assign a grade of 1 
through 4 to indicate the severity of AEs. For AEs that are not listed in the WHO criteria, the 
Investigator will use medical judgment to assess the severity of the AE.
The following are guidelines to be used by the Investigator to judge the event severity of an 
AE that is not in the WHO Toxicity Criteria:
Mild -awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated
   Moderate -discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity
   Severe -incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity
   Life Threatening
3.Duration: Start and end dates and times, or if continuing.

5.Whether it constitutes a SAE, per definition below.
6.Outcome: resolved, resolved/ with sequelae, continuing, death, or unknown (only for 
subjects that are lost to follow -up).
The investigator (or designee) should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the AE based on the 
sign, symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, and not the 
individual signs/symptoms or laboratory abnormalities should be documents in the subject’s 
source documentation and the CRF unless the etiology of the event is unknown.  An 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in 
severity, the suspected relationship to study drug, the interventions required to treat it and the 
outcome.
9.2.2Treatment Emergent A dverse Events (TEA E)
A TEAE will be an AE that occurred during the study after the first dose of study drug or that 
was present prior to dosing and exacerbates after the first dose of study drug. Based on the 
half-life of study drug (3.5-4 hours) and the varied time between dosing a migraine attack, the 
temporal relationship of anadverse event to time of dosing will be as assessed prior to 
considering the adverse event to be a TEAE. Any new AE recorded 48 hours after a dose of 
study drug will not be considered a TEAE.
9.2.3Serious A dverse Events
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:
•Death : This includes death unrelated to the study drug (e.g. car accident).  If a subject dies 
during the study and an autopsy is performed, autopsy results will become part of the 
subject’s study chart and a copy should be sent to the Sponsor.
•Life-threatening experience
•Required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization : Exceptions will be hospitalizations for a) 
elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication 
under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug or b) treatment on an 
emergency outpatient basis fo r an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not 
resulting in hospital admission 
•Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•Congenital anomaly
•Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threateni ng, or 
require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above.
9.2.4 Unexpected A dverse Event
An unexpected adverse even t is defined as an AE, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the information in the Investigator’s Brochure for lasmiditan .
9.3Reporting Serious Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causality , to the Sponsor 
or their designated representative by entering the information into the eCRF within 24 hours of 
learning of the occurrence.  The reporting timeframe starts when the subject signs the informed 
Eli Lilly and Company                                         IND 103,420
H8H-CD-LAHL( D)/COL MIG -305 Final V 4                                          
LY573144 Page 38of 74consent form and ends following the last dose of study treatment at EoS/ET/Visit 6.  At a 
minimum, a description of the event and the Investigator’s judgment of causality must be 
provided at the time of the initial report. These preliminary reports will be followed by detailed 
descriptions that will include copies of de-identified hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and 
other documents when requested and applicable.
Complications or progression of an initial SAE must be reported as a follow -up SAE Report to 
theoriginal SAE, regardless of when the follow -up information is received by the Investigator .  A 
follow -up SAE Report must be submitted within 24 hours of the Investigator receiving the 
follow -up information.  An SAE that is considered completely unrelated to a previously reported 
one should be reported separately as a new SAE.
Follow -up information should be communicated byupdating the data in the SAE eCRF . The 
follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it 
was treated, and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation. 
If the SAE was not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure and is thought to be 
related to study drug, the Sponsor or their designee may urgentl y require further information 
from the Investigator for regulatory authority reporting. The Sponsor may need to issue an 
Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that 
this SAE has been reported.
The Investigator and study personnel should institute any supplemental investigations of SAEs 
based on their clinical judgment of likely causative factors. This may include clinical laboratory 
tests not specified in the protocol, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with 
specialists. The Sponsor or their designee may also request the Investigator to conduct 
supplemental assessments.
The Investigator should notify Quintiles Pharmacovigilance of any death or SAE occurring after 
a subject has withdrawn from the study when such a death or SAE may reasonably be related 
to the study drug. However, the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek adverse events in 
former study p articipants.
9.4Follow-up of adverse events
All SAEs and any non -serious adverse events or laboratory abnormalities resulting in premature 
discontinuation will be followed until they have resolved, returned to baseline, or are determined 
to be chronic orstable by the Investigator .  Other non-serious adverse events should be 
followed through the EoS/ET/Visit6.  
9.5Reporting safety information to the IRB/EC
The Investigator is responsible for following all local regulations for the reporting of safety 
information, including the reporting of SAEs to the IRB/ EC .
The Investigator must promptly report to his or her IRB /ECall unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects.  This includes death from any cause and all serious adverse events 
reasonably or possibly associated with the use of study drug.  It is recommended that all SAEs 
occurring at a site, regardless of ca usality, be reported to the site’s IRB/EC in accordance with

LY573144 Page 39of 74Lasmiditan has been filed under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US 
FDA.  An SAE may require safety reports to be filed to regulatory agencies if the SAE is related 
to the study drug and is unexpected based upon the current Investigator’s Brochure.  In this 
case, the Investigator will receive a copy of the safety report as submitted to the regulatory 
agencies.  The Investigator is responsible for submitting the safety report (initial and follow -up) 
or other safety information (e.g., revised Investigator’s Brochure) to the IRB/EC in accordance 
with the IRB/EC’s requirements and keep a copy in their files.
9.6Pregnancies
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject on study drug must be reported to the 
medical monitor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  Subjects who become pregnant 
will be withdrawn from the study.  The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, 
includ ing spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn 
complications. 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a subject’s source documents and a Pregn ancy Notification 
and Outcome Form and reported by the Investigator to Quintiles Pharmacovigilance using the 
same procedure for reporting SAEs in Section 9.3. A pregnancy, by itself, is not a SAE.  
Pregnancy follow -up should also be recorded and should i nclude an assessment of the possible 
relationship to the study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any pregnancy -related SAE (e.g. 
spontaneous abortion) or any other SAE experienced during pregnancy must be recorded on a 
separate SAE Report Form and reported p er SAE reporting procedures in Section 9.3 .
10.STATISTICS
Prior to locking the database, a detailed statistical analysis plan will be developed before any
receipt of study data and decisions will be made regarding the integrity of subject data for 
inclusion in the statistical analysis.  All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population. 
The efficacy analyses and baseline characteristics will be based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) and 
mITT population . The Per Protocol Population will be used to support the ITTanalyses.
The primary objective of this study is toevaluate thesafety and tolerability oflong-term
intermittent useoflasmiditan 100mgand of lasmiditan 200mg,asthefirstand as asecond
dose, intheacute treatment ofmigraine.
The secondary objective of the study is to explore the long-term efficacy of lasmiditan 100 mg 
and lasmiditan 200 mg in terms of headache response over time .
Summary analysis of the safety and efficacy of the use of a second dose of lasmiditan for either 
rescue or recurrence will be performed only in the subjects that actually took a second dose of 
study drug within 24 hours of the first dose.   Analysis will beperformed on the subset of 
subjects that dosed for rescue and on the subset that dosed for recurrence of migraine.
Data from all investigative sites will be pooled for all planned analyses.  Analysis of individual 
site findings will be considered if necessary.  For those measures that are summarized using 
change from baseline scores, observed scores may also be presented descriptively.

LY573144 Page 40of 74Any changes in the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
only if it changes a princi pal feature of the protocol.  Any other changes to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol and the justification for making the change will be described 
in the statistical analysis plan as well as the clinical study report.  Additional explorat ory 
analyses will be conducted as deemed appropriate.  All data listings, summaries and analyses 
will be performed by Quintiles.
10.1Sample Size
This Phase 3 study is designed to demonstrate that lasmiditan is safe in the long-term 
intermittent treatment of acute migraine in adult patients with and without aura. The sample size 
was chosen to provide an appropriate long-term safety database. It is not based on any
statistical hypothesis. In accordance with ICH guidelines , the goal is at least 300 patients will 
treat an average of2 migraines per month for 6 months and at least 100 patients will treat an 
average of 2 migraines per month for 12 months.
10.2Randomization 
This is a multicenter, randomized, open -label, parallel group study.  
Subjects will be centrally randomized to one of two treatments to receive lasmiditan 200 mg 
(L200 mg) or lasmiditan 100 mg (L100 mg) in a 1:1 ratio.  Subjects will be stratified (yes o r no) 
for use of concomitant medications that reduce the frequency of migraine episodes.  Subject will 
be randomized and study drug will be dispensed at each study visit.
10.3Analysis Populations
10.3.1Disposition

LY573144 Page 42of 74The 2nddose ITT, mITT and PP analysis populations will be further qualified by reason for 
second dose. Subjects will be considered in the 2nddose rescue populations or 2nddose 
recurrence populations as defined:
Rescue population :All randomized subjects who did not achieve headache pain free at 
2 hours, completed the 2 hour assessments and took a second dose of study drug 
between 2 hours and 24 hours. 
Recurrence population :All randomized subjects who achieved headache pain free at 2 
hours, but then experience drecurrence of mild, moderate or severe migraine pain and 
tooka second dose of study drug up to 24 hours from the first dose .
10.4Accountability and Background Characteristics
10.4.1Enrollment and Disposition
The number of subjects enrolled, by study population and Investigative site, will be presented by 
treatment .  The primary reasons for discontinuation will be summarized by treatment and based 
on the safety population.  The number and percentage ofsubjects with protocol deviations 
leading to exclusion from the PP population will be presented by reason for exclusion, stratified 
by treatment.  All deviations will be listed.
10.4.2Subject Characteristics
Subject characteristics will be obtained at the Screening/Visit 1prior to randomization and will 
be summarized by treatment arm and overall. Summaries will include descriptive statistics for 
continuous measures (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) 
and for categorical measu res (sample size, frequency and percent ages ).  
The results of these tests will be used in a descriptive way to highlight potential imbalances 
between the treatment groups.  Subject characteristics may include, but are not limited to: age, 
gender, race/et hnicity, height, weight, BMI, and migraine history .
Subject characteristics will be summarized on all study populations.
10.4.3Treatment Exposure
Treatment exposure will be assessed in terms of the actual dose.  Summary statistics will be 
performed on the number of subjects who took a first dose for the treatment of their migraine 
and the number of subjects who took both a first and second dose.  The average dosage used 
per month in three month intervals and the cumulative doses taken over the course of the study 
will be summarized within each treatment arm using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum) .
10.5Safety Analyses
Values for all safety variables will be listed by subject and time point as appropriate .
Where appropriate, safety variables will be summarized by using descriptive statistics, 
separated by treatment arm and dose (the first dose and the second dose for recurrence or 
rescue or use of alternative rescue medication), and time of assessment. Desc riptive statistics 
for quantitative variables will include: n, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard 
deviation. Descriptive statistics for qualitative variables will include frequency counts and

LY573144 Page 43of 74percentages. Adverse events will be summarized in terms of the proportion of patients and the 
proportion of attacks associated with any adverse event and with specific adverse events .
10.5.1Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ) preferred terms, 
and all summary tables for AEs will be organized by these categories. Frequency counts and 
percentages will be presented for subjects with AEs within each system organ class and 
preferred term, separated by treatment arm and dose (the first dose and the second dose for 
recurrence or rescue or alternative rescue medication).  Both subjects ever experiencing an 
event as well as total events will be presented.  Descriptive statistics will also be calculated for 
each treatment arm and dose (initial and second dose for recurrence or rescue medication) for
AE relationship and AE severity. If multiple intensities are reported for a given AE for a subject, 
the most severe intensity will be counted. A separate, similar analysis will be conducted for 
TEAEs.
An AE with the date of onset on or within 48 hours after a dose of study drug, or an event that 
worsens in intensity within 48 hours of a dose of study drug will be considered a TEAE.  An AE 
that occurs in the interval after 48 hours of dosing until the next migraine is dosed will not be 
considered a TEAE.
SAEs and TEAEs that resulted in termination of the study drug and withdrawal from the study 
will be presented.
10.5.2Physical Examinations, Vital Signs, ECG Parameters and Clinical Labora tory Test 
Values
By-subject listings of physical examinations, vital signs, ECG parameters and clinical laboratory 
data will include indications of values that are outside the reference ranges, and values that are 
clinically significant.  Observed and chan ge from baseline (Screening/Visit 1) values for vital 
signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory test results will be summarized as appropriate by treatment 
arm and dose. Shift tables describing out-of-reference range shifts will be provided for vital 
signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory test results from the Screening/Visit 1to EoS/Visit 6, as 
appropriate by treatment arm and dose.
10.5.3C-SSRS
By-subject listings of any suicidal ideation or behavior will be listed.
10.6Efficacy Analyses
This is an open -label study with no control group.  Efficacy data will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics. The proportion of attacks treated with lasmiditan 100 mg and with 
lasmiditan 200 mg which respond at 2 hours will be calculated for each 3 m onth period.
10.6.1Headache Response
Headache pain freeat 2 hours will be defined as a reduction in headache severity from 
moderate (2) or severe (3)at baseline to none (0)two hours after dosing with study drug.  MBS  
free at 2 hours will be defined as a ‘no’ response to the presence of thesymptom (either 
nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia) that was identified as MBS at predose, 2 hours after 
dosing with study drug.
A qualifying migraine is defined as a migraine treated with study drug within 4 hou rs of onset

LY573144 Page 44of 74Subjects taking rescue medication within the first two hours or who fail to record headache 
severity at 2 hours will be assumed to be non -responders in the mITT and the ITT analyses.  
A subject is defined to have used rescue medication within the first two hours post dosing if at 
least one medication is documented in the rescue medication log in the subject electronic diary 
for which:
0 (min) < date/ time rescue medication (diary) –date/ time of dosing (diary) < 120 (min).
Subjects who d o not provide a headache pain severity rating at baseline or who use other 
medication prior to the study drug for the study migraine attack will be assumed to be non -
responders for the mITT and ITT analysis .
10.6.2Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints
The analyses of pain free at 2 hours and of MBS freeat 2 hours are defined as proportions .  
The prespecified approach for handling missing data is to assume that subjects with missing 
data are nonresponders .  While this approach is appropriately conservative, a sensitivity 
analysis will be incorporated to exclude subjects with missing data .
10.6.3Other Efficacy A nalyses
10.6.3.1Headache relief
The proportion of attacks treated with study medication with headache relief (moderate or
severe headache at baseline, which became mild or none , or mild headache which became
none )at 2 hours post dose will be evaluated. The time course to headache relief will be 
explored up to 48 hours . 
10.6.3.2Headache recurrence
The proportion of attacks treated with study medication with headache recurrence (moderate or
severe headache at baseline, which became pain free at 2 hours post -dose and worsened
again up to 48hours post -dose )will be evaluated based on first dose.   
10.6.3.3Headache rescue
The requirement for rescue medication at 2 hours and between 2 and 24 hours and 24- 48 
hours (yes or no) will be evaluated based on first dose. The information on rescue medication 
use will be presented descriptively by time of use and treatment arm.
10.6.3.4Associated Symptoms of Migraine
Descriptive analysis of the associated symptoms of migraine, nausea, phonophobia and 
photophobia, will be performed at 2 hours. Freedom from each symptom willbe defined as a 
‘no’ response to the presence of the symptom 2 hours after dosing with study drug. Summary 
statistics will be presented by treatment arm and timepoi nt as appropriate.
10.6.3.5Additional analys es
Summary statistics will be presented on presence of vomiting, disability (4 point scale: not at all 
(0), mil d interference (1), moderate interference (2), completely, needs bed rest (3)), and patient 
global impression of change (7 point scale) by treatment arm and timepoint as appropriate.

LY573144 Page 45of 7410.7Analysis of Second dose
10.7.1Analysis of second dose for rescue
A second dose of study drug will be considered rescue medication if taken by a subject that did 
not achieve headache pain free at 2 hours and completed the 2 hour assessments prior to 
taking the second dose.
Summary statistics will be presented by treatment armon relief of migraine symptoms (pain free
and MBS free ) along with the time course to headache relief explored up to 48 hours.  Subjects 
that use an alternative rescue medication will not be included in the summary statistics of 
response to treatment for rescue.
10.7.2Analysis of second dose for recurrence
A second dose of study drug will be considered treatment for recurrence iftaken by a subject 
that achieved headache pain free at 2 hours, completed the 2 hour assessments, and then 
experienced documented recurrence of mild, moderate, or severe migraine pain prior to taking 
the second d ose.  
Summary statistics will be presented by treatment arm on the relief of migraine symptoms (pain
freeand MBS free ) along with the time course to headache relief explored up to 48 hours. Only 
subjects that used a second dose of study drug for recurrence of migraine will be included in the 
summary statistics of response to treatment for recurrence.
10.8Resource Utilization
By-subject listings of any resour ce utilization will be listed and will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics, separ ated by treatment arm and visit.  Days missed from work and/or 
school or daily activities will be tabulated from information recorded on the MIDAS scale
separated by treatment arm and visit .

LY573144 Page 47of 7412.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
The Investigator or the appointed persons agree to complete the subject's eCRFs ,at each 
investigation. Only the Investigator or appointed persons in his/her team may fill out or correct 
the eCRFs. The eCRFs will display the subject number corresponding to the order of inclusion 
in the study (7 digits) and the initials of the subject (1 letter for forename , 1 letter for middle 
name and 1letter for surname).
The Sponsor or their designee will review the eCRFs entered by investigational site staff for 
completeness and accuracy and instruct the investigational site staff to make any required 
corrections or additions.  Queries will be sent to the investigational site using an electronic data 
query within the EDC system.  Designated investigational site staff will be required to respond to 
the query and make any necessary changes to the data.  
All corrections and alterations of data on the eCRFs must be made by the Investigator or by the 
appointed persons as instructed in the eCRF guidelines. If corrections or alterations are 
required of paper source documents, corrections may be made in the following manner: strike 
through the datum to be corrected using a single line so that the original remains legible; 
correction fluid must never be used. The correction should be written to the side or above the 
original entry and must be initialed and dated by the Investigator or one of his designated team.
It is the r esponsibility of the monitor to make certain that all data are completed on the eCRFs.
The Investigator and the monitor must sign and date the eCRF per the eCRF procedure in order 
to attest respectively to the:
authenticity of the data collected in the eCRF, and
coherence between the data in the eCRF and those in the source documents.
Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system.  
Adverse events and medical history will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory 
activities (MedDRA) terminology.
ECGs will be evaluated for safety through central readers and the results will be sent 
electronically to the study database.  Clinical laboratory samples will be processed through a 
central laborator yand the results will be sent electronically to the study database .
Randomization codes and data about all study drugs dispensed to the subject will be tracked 
using a centralized randomization process.  The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will 
also manage the database.  The database will be sent electronically to the study database (or a 
designated CRO).      
After the above actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be 
complete and accurate, it will be locked for data analysis.  Any changes to the database after 
that time can only be made with the approval of Lilly.
At the end of the study, the Investigator will receive a CD or DVD of all data submitted for 
subjects at that site.  This CD or DVD will serve as the archival copy and must be retained per 
the record retention policy.

LY573144 Page 48of 74The Investigator will keep a log of volunteers screened for study participation as appropriate and 
will indicate the reason why individual volunteers did not enter the study. The log will be 
submitted to the CRO or their designee as defined in the study manual.  The Investigator must 
submit to the Sponsor or its representatives a completed eCRF for each subject who receives 
any study drug .
If computerized medical files are used, and if the computer system allows, no change made in 
the medical files by the Investigator should obscure the original information. The record must 
clearly indicate that a change was made and clearly provide a means to locate and read the 
prior information. The Investigator will save data at regular intervals.
The Investigator must guarantee the safety of the study data in the medical files by 
implementing security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the data and to the 
computer system.

reported from CRO/Sponsor.
13.2Written Informed Consent
Subjects will be informed of the nature of the study, its aim, itspossible risks and restrictions, its 
duration and the fee , if any, they will receive. The protocol will be explained during a meeting 
prior to the study and each subject must be informed that participation in the study is voluntary 
and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time. At this meeting, an information sheet 
will be given to each subject. The subject should read the form and obtain answers to any 
questions prior to signing and dating the informed consent form. The process of obtaining 
informed consent should be documented in the subject source documents.  Each Investigator 
must retain the original signed and dated informed consent form.  A  copy of the signed and 
dated informed consent form will be given to the subject.  No subject can enter the study, or 
have study specific assessments performed before his/her informed consent has been obtained .  
Lilly or its designated representative(s) will provide to Investigators in a separate document a 
propo sed informed consent form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory 
requirements and is considered appropriate for this study.  Any changes to the proposed 
consent form suggested by the Investigator must be agreed to by Lilly or its designate d 
representative(s) before submission to the IRB/IEC/REB and a copy of the approved version 
must be provided to the Lilly monitor or designated representative(s) after IRB/IEC/REB 
approval.
13.3Amendments to the protocol
To alter the protocol, amendments must be written byLilly, and approvals must be received 
from all parties that approved the original protocol (IRB/IEC/REB, and if applicable, the local 
regulatory authorities) before implementation.  However, in cases where an amendment is 
required for s ubject safety, an amendment may be implemented prior to IRB/IEC/REB approval.  
Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is 
expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any subject included inthis 
study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol.  
Lilly may make administrative changes (i.e., changes that do not significantly affect subject 
safety, the study’s scope or scientific quality) without a formal protocol amendment .
13.4Discontinuation of the study
Lillyreserves the right to discontinue this study under the conditions specified in the clinical trial 
agreement.
13.5Study drug supply, storage and tracking
Study drugs must be received by a designated person at thestudy site, handled and stored 
safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designated 
assistants have access.  Upon receipt, all study drugs should be stored according to the 
instructions specified on the drug labels.  Drug labels will be in the local language and comply 
with the legal requirements of each country.  Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in 
accordance with the protocol.

LY573144 Page 50of 74Subjects will be asked to return all unused study drug and packaging at each clinic visit, at the 
end of the study or at the time of study drug discontinuation.  All empty, partially used containers 
and unused supplies may be destroyed at the site, retrieved by the study monitor or shipped to 
a designated facility identified by Lillyaccording to governmental regulations at the conclusion of 
this study (or as appropriate during the course of the study), per the instructions of the Sponsor. 
The Investigator will keep an accurate accounting of all study drug dispensed, destroyed or 
returned.  Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by the monitor during site visits 
and at the completion of the trial.
13.6Confidentiality
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential.  The Inves tigator and other 
study personnel must not disclose such information without prior written approval from Lilly.
Subject confidentiality will be strictly maintained to the extent possible under the law.  Subject 
names must not be disclosed.  Subjects will be identified on the CRFs and other documents 
submitted to Lilly, or its designated representative, by their initials and/or assigned subject 
number.  Documents that identify the subject (e.g., the signed informed consent form) should 
not be submitted to Lilly or its designated representative, and must be maintained in confidence 
by the Investigator.

The MIDAS (Migraine Disability Assessment) questionnaire was put together to help you measure the
impact your headaches hav e on your life. The information on this questionnaire is also helpful for your
primary care provider to determine the level of pain and disability caused by your headaches and to find
the best treatment for you.
INSTRUCTIONS: Please ans wer the following questions about ALL of the headaches you hav e had over 
the last 3 months. Record your answer in the box next to each question.  Select zero if you did not have the 
activity in the last 3 months
__________ 1. On how many days in the last 3 months did you miss work or school
because of your headaches?
__________ 2. How many days in the last 3 months was your productivity at work or
school reduced by half or more because of your headaches? (Do not
include days you counted in question 1 wher e you missed work or
school.)
__________ 3. On how many days in the last 3 months did you not do household work
(such as housework, home repairs and maintenance, shopping, caring
for children and relatives) because of your headaches?
__________ 4. How many days in the last 3 months was your productivity in household
work reduced by half of more because of your headaches? (Do not
include days you counted in question 3 where you did not do household
work.)
__________ 5. On how many days in the last 3 months did you miss family, social or
leisure activities because of your headaches?
__________ Total (Questions 1 -5)
__________ A. On how many days in the last 3 months did you hav e a headache? (If a
headache lasted more than 1 day, count each day.)
__________ B. On a scale of 0 -10, on average how painful were these headaches?
(where 0 = no pain at all, and 10 = pain as bad as it can be.)
Scoring: After you have filled out this questionnaire, add the total number of days from questions 1 to 5 
(ignor e A and B).

LY573144 Page 67of 7421.APPENDIX 6. Protocol Amendment History
Protocol H8H-CD-LAHL/COL MIG-305 [AnOpen -label, Long -term, Safety Study ofLasmiditan
(200 mgand 100 mg) intheAcute Treatment ofMigraine] has been amended.  The new 
protocol is indicated by amendment (D)/V4 and will be used to conduct the study in place of any 
preceding version of the protocol.
The rationale for the amendment include the following:
As part of the lasmiditan clinical development process, Lilly reviewed the totality of the 
lasmiditan data, including the recently concluded Study LAIF that assessed duration of 
driving impairment at a maximum lasmiditan dose of 200 mg.  In light of the lack of 
driving study data on potential impairment at doses above 200 mg, Lilly has determined 
that the maximum permitted dose in 24 hours will be 200 mg across the lasmiditan 
clinical development program.  Therefore, patients in this study will be instructed to no 
longer take a sec ond dose of lasmiditan 200 mg in a 24 -hour period.   
While a second dose of lasmiditan 100 mg will continue to be permitted, pooled results 
of prior studies do not provide clear evidence of clinical benefit when a second dose is 
taken for rescue.  However, there is some evidence that a second dose of 100 mg could 
be effective for headache recurrence (the pain goes away completely and later returns).  
Therefore the study is limiting second dose with lasmiditan 100 mg to use for recurrence 
only.
The re-dispen sing of unused study drug is no longer allowed, and therefore language 
pertaining to re -dispensing has been deleted.
As lasmiditan was associated with driving impairment in a study of healthy volunteers on 
a computer -based driving simulator, language was updated to indicate patients should 
restrict their driving, operation of heavy machinery, or other similar activities after taking 
study drug as described in the ICF.
As the standard Lilly hepatic monitoring language and tests were omitted from the study 
when the protocol was previously updated, these have been included in order to 
effectively assess abnormalities pertaining to hepatic laboratory analytes .
Clarification to the schedule of activities footnote was made to indicate that repeat and/or 
additional laboratory testing may be necessary if clinically significant laboratory results 
are obtained.
The overall changes and rationale for the changes made to this protocol are described in the 
following table:

1Synopsis:
Study Design: 
…
Subjects will be asked to treat all migraine attacks with study drug on an outpatient basis for up 
to 12 months.  Each patient’s study participation will consist of a screening visit (Visit 1) and a 
treatment period of up to 12 months during which the subject will treat all migraine attacks with 
either lasmiditan 200 mg or lasmiditan 100 mg (with a second dose of stud y drug permitted 
between 2 and 24 hours (h) for rescue or recurrence of migraine only for subjects randomized to 
lasmiditan 100 mg ). 
…
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, to receive lasmiditan 100 mg (L100 mg) or 
lasmiditan 200 mg (L200 mg) . Subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg will be allowed to take 
a second dose of their assigned treatment study drug if needed for rescue or recurrence of 
migraine.
Treatment Period : Subjects will be asked to use lasmiditan as the first treatment for each new 
migraine attack within 4 hours of onset providing that the headache severity is at least moderate 
at that time and not improving. Subjects should not exceed a total dose of 200 mg of lasmiditan 
in a 24 -hour period. Subjects will record their response to the first dose over the next 48 hours 
using an electronic diary. Subjects will be asked not to use rescue medication until at least 2 
hours after dosing with study drug and completing the 2 hour assessments. If the migrai ne 
(headache pain) does not respond at 2 hours, a second dose of study drug may be taken up to 
24 hours after the first dose as long as no other rescue medication has been used. If the 
migraine does respond swithin 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after 2 
hours, a second dose of study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose only for 
subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg . Subjects will record their response to a second 
dose, taken for either rescue or recurrence, for 48 h ours in the electronic diary. The total time 
for recording response to study drug is up to 72 hours depending on whether or not a second 
dose of study drug is used (for subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg ). Subjects using an 
alternate medication other than a second dose of study drug for the treatment of migraine 
rescue or recurrence will report the use of medication and continue to record their responses in 
the electronic diary up to the 48 hour timepoint.

…
All doses of lasmiditan were associated with driving impairment in a study of healthy volunteers 
on a c omputer -based driving simulator. Patients should restri ct their driving, operation of heavy
machinery, or other similar activities after taking study drug,as described in the informed 
consent form (ICF). Since somnolence, dizziness and fatigue have been reported with study 
drug administration, patients partici pating in this study will be advised not to drive or operate 
machinery after taking treatment until they know how they will react to lasmiditan.
Rescue medication (other than study drug) will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour 
assessments if themigraine does not respond (subject is not headache pain free).  A second 
dose of randomized study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose as long as no 
other rescue medication has been used.
For subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg, iIfthe migraine responds within 2 hours 
(headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after 2 hours, a second dose of randomized 
study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose.

drug. Total time to record response is up to 72 hours if a second dose of study drug
is taken for rescue or recurrence of migraine (for subjects randomized to lasmiditan 
100 mg) (See Section 9.1.8).
7.3.1Rescue Medication
Rescue medication (other than study drug) will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour 
assessments if the migrai ne does not respond (subject is not headache pain free). If the 
migraine does not respond within 2 hours a second dose of randomized study drug may be 
taken up to 24 hours after the first dose as long as no other rescue medication has been used. 
7.3.2Recurrence Medication
If the migraine responds within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after 2 
hours, a second dose of randomized study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose
(only for subjects randomized to lasmiditan 10 0 mg) . 
7.5Treatment Compliance
Study drug will be taken by the subject on an outpatient basis throughout the study.  Prior to 
discharge from Screening/Visit 1 subjects will be given study drug to treat all migraine attacks 
for the first month. Information on the time and date of each dose (initial treatment along with 
the use of rescue medication or treatment of recurrence with a second dose of study drug for 
subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg ) will be recorded by the subject in the electr onic 
diary.  
8.1Study Drug

Subjects are to return all dosing cards (used and unused to each visit).  Remaining tablets can 
be re -dispensed along with the next assigned patient 8 -tablet single card or carton as 
appropriate based on the individual subjects need.  
…
Subjects will be instructed to take a second dose (one tablet) of study drug (only for those 
subjects randomized to lasmiditan 100 mg), if needed ,with approximately 4 ounces of water for 
rescue or for recurrence of migra ine at least 2 hours after the first dose.   Subjects should not 
exceed a total dose of 200 mg of lasmiditan in a 24 -hour period.
9.1.5.3 Hepatic Safety Monitoring
If a study subject experiences elevated ALT ≥3X ULN, AST ≥3X ULN, ALP ≥2X ULN, or 
elevated TBL ≥2X ULN, liver testing (Appendix 5; Section 20) should be repeated within 3 to 5 
days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and creatine 
kinase to confirm the abnormality and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing.  If the 
abnormality persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring should be initiated by the 
investigator and in consultation with the study medical monitor.  Monitoring of ALT, AST, TBL, 
and ALP should continue until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels. 
Hepatic Safety Data Collection
Additional safety data should be collected if 1 or more of the following conditions occur: 
Elevation of serum ALT to ≥5X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests
Elevation of serum AST to ≥5X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests
Elevated serum TBL to ≥ 2X ULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndrome) 
Elevation of serum ALP to ≥2X ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests
Subject discontinued from treatment due to a hepatic e vent or abnormality of liver tests
Hepatic event considered to be a SAE
9.1.7Dosing Instructions
…
Subjects will be asked to treat each migraine attack within 4 hours of onset providing that the 
headache severity is at least moderate at that time and not improving. Subjects will record their 
response over the next 48 hours using an electronic diary.  Subjects should not exceed a total 
dose of 200 mg of lasmiditan in a 24 -hour period.  Subjects will be instructed not to use rescue 
medication (other than st udy drug) until at least 2 hours after taking study drug.  If the subject 
does not become headache pain free within 2 hours, rescue medication (other than study drug)
will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour assessments.  A second dose of randomize d 
study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose as long as no other rescue 
medication has been used.   The Investigator will advise each subject as to alternative suitable 
rescue medication. Triptans, ergots, opioids and barbiturates MUST NOT be used for rescue 
medication within 24 hours of study drug administration.   For subjects randomized to lasmiditan 
100 mg, Iif the migraine responds within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs 
after 2 hours ,a second dose of randomized study drug may be taken for up to 24 hours from 
the first dose.

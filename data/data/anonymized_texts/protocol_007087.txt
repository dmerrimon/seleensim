3/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 4: 
RATIONALE  
Protocol BO43328 has been amended primarily to add two new treatment arms to 
Cohort 1.  Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are 
summarized below : 
 The RO7247669 600 mg treatment arm has been added for Cohort 1 to evaluate 
the efficacy, safety, a nd pharmacokinetics of a lower dose of  RO7247669  based on 
emergin g data ( new Appendix  15).  The following sections of the protocol have been 
updated to  reflect the addition of this new treatment arm:   Secti ons 1. 3, 3.1.2,  3.1.3, 
3.1.5, 4.1.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.6, 4.5.7.2 , 4.5.8, 4.5.9.1, 
4.5.9.2 , 4.5.11 , 4.6.1,  Appendix 9 , Figure 2, and Tables 4 and 5.    
 The RO7247669 600 m g  tiragolumab treatment arm has been added for Cohort 1 
to evaluate the efficacy, safety, a nd pharmacokinetics of a lower dose of  
RO7247669  in combination with tiragolumab  based on emerging data ( new 
Appendix 16).  The following sections of the protocol have been updated to reflect 
the addition of this new treatment arm:  Sections 1. 3, 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.5, 4.1.2, 4.4, 
4.5, 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4, 4.5.5, 4.5.6, 4.5.7.2, 4.5.8, 4.5.9.1, 4.5.9.2, 4.5.11, 
4.6.1, Appendix 9, Figure 2, and Tables 4 and 5.  
 Figure 3 was updated to clarify that  collection of archival  tissue  may take place 
during screening (Section 3.1.2) . 
 The sample size s have been updated  to 195290 patients  in Cohort 1  and 
846 patients in Cohort 2 to reflect  the number of patients currently enrolled  (as of 
20 March 2023)  in the trial and the addition of the two new treatment arms  
(Section  3.1.2, Section 6.1, Figure 2, and Table 4).  
 Text has been added to clarify that f or most arms, approximately 20 patients will be 
enrolled during the prelimi nary phase.  Approximately 40  patients will be enrolled in 
the RO7247669 600 mg  and RO7247669 600 mg   tiragolumab  arms during the 
preliminary phase to ensure a more precise  benefitrisk assessment in arms with 
the lower dose of RO7247669  (Section 3.1.2  and Figure 2 ). 
 Text was added to indicate that pausing enrollment while conducting the  safety 
evaluation  phase after 6 patients  will not be needed for a lower dose of a study drug 
that has already completed a  safety  evaluation for a higher dose  (Section 3.1.3) , but 
a formal safety evaluation will be still conducted and the same stopping criteria will 
apply as for higher dose arms . 
 Text has been updated to indicate that t umor assessments performed as standard 
of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to 
randomization/enrollment do not have to be repeated at screening.   The previous 
timeframe was 14 days; the extension will reduce patient burden ( Section 4.5.7.1  
and Appendix 10 ). 
 It has been clarified that in Cohort 1 , tumor assessments performed outside the 
protocol mandated time window do not have to be repeated (Section  4.5.7.2 ). 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
4/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4  Text has been clarified to indicate that fresh tumor tissue will b e processed as 
described in the laboratory manual (Section 4.5.9.2)  
 Table 6 has been updated to clarify that archival tissue collection during screening 
for Cohorts 1 and 2 is mandatory , if tissue is available (Section 4.5.9.2).  
 Text has been added to indi cate that after the end of the reporting period  for 
non-serious adverse events  (defined as 30 days after the final dose of study 
treatment), all treatment -related non -serious adverse events that lead to surgery 
delay will continue to be reported until 135 days after the final dose of study 
treatment .  This will  allow reporting of these adverse events , which  are outside of 
the allowed 30 day reporting period , in the event of  delay in surgery (Section 5.6  
and footnotes in schedule of activities for all append ices).  
 Text has been modified to clarify that patients who do not proceed to complete  
lymph node dissection  will be classified as non -responders  (Section 6.4.1) . 
 Text has been added to specify that weight, limited physical examination, 12-lead 
ECG , and E astern Cooperative Oncology Group  assessments may be performed 
within 24 hours prior to  dosing  during the treatment period  in order to provide 
additional flexibility for patients and study sites  (schedule of activities for 
Appendices  1116). 
 Language has been added to indicate the approval of  relatlimab   by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration  for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma  
(Section 1.1.1.2  and Appendices 12, 14, 15, and 16).  
 Text has been updated describing Study NP41300  to align with the RO7247669 
Investigator’s Brochure Version 4 (Appendices 12, 14, 15 , and 16).  
 Throughout the protocol, the dose of RO7247669 has been updated to indicate the 
use of either 2100 or 600 mg . 
  
Additional minor changes have been made t o improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

STUDY RATIONALE  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of treatment 
combinations in cancer immunotherapy (CIT) -naive patients with resectable Stage III melanoma 
(Cohort 1) and in patients with Stage IV melanoma (Cohort 2).  Four  check point inhibitors , 
namely ipilimumab, pembrolizumab,  nivolumab, and relatlimab  are now appro ved by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration  for the treatment of unresectable or advanced disease.  For 
patients with macroscopic Stage III melanoma, surgery followed by adjuvant immunotherapy 
within 1 year of either nivolumab or pembrolizumab  treatment  is generally indicated.  Patients 
with clinically detectable Stage III melanoma are ideal candidates for neoadjuvant therapy 
because they represent a high -risk patient population with poor outcomes when treated with 
upfront surgery alone.  Neoadjuvant the rapy also has the advantage of providing information on 
pathologic response, which is valuable to estimate prognosis and to guide the choice of 
adjuvant therapy and follow -up.  This study protocol was developed in accordance with  
International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium guidelines to create the needed consistency 
amongst neoadjuvant trials in order to facilitate optimal data organization for future regulatory 
review.  Its exploratory analysis plan will strengthen translational research across the melan oma 
disease continuum.

OVERALL DESIGN AND STUDY POPULATION  
This is a Phase Ib/II, open -label, multicenter, randomized, umbrella study in patients with 
resectable Stage III (Cohort 1) or Stage IV (Cohort 2) melanoma.  The study is designed with 
the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, close existing 
treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, modify the 
patient population (e.g.,  with regard to prior anti -cancer treatment or biomarker status), or 
introduce additional co horts of patients with other types of melanoma.  
Two cohorts will be enrolled in parallel in this study.  Cohort 1 will consist of patients with 
resectable Stage III melanoma with measurable lymph node metastases according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in  Solid Tumors, Version 1.1  that can be biopsied, who have no history of 
in-transit metastases within the last 6 months, and who have not received systemic CIT for their 
disease, for example , PD-1/PD -L1 and/or CTLA -4 blocking agents or other agents.  Cohort  2 
will consist of patients with Stage IV melanoma who experienced disease progression  during or 
after at least one but not more than two lines of treatment for metastatic disease.  Up to two 
lines of checkpoint inhibition therapy (monotherapy or combinati on therapy) are allowed.  
Patients with BRAF -mutant disease may have received an additional line of targeted therapy 
(either before,  intermittent with,  or after the checkpoint inhibition therapy) or may have received 
targeted therapy and checkpoint inhibit ion therapy concurrently as one combination treatment.  
Patients with BRAF -mutant melanoma with rapidly progressive disease who have not been 
previously treated with approved targeted therapies are not eligible.  
In each cohort, eligible patients will initially be randomly assigned to one of several treatment 
arms (see below).  Currently, there are no arms open for enrollment in Cohort 2.

22/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON MELANOMA  
Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes .  This potentially deadly form of skin 
cancer is one of the fastest growing malignancies (Algazi et al . 2010;  Finn et al . 2012) .  
More than 300,000 people worldwide are currently diagnosed with melanoma each year , 
and 57,000 people die of the disease (Fer lay et al . 2018) .  The clinical outcome s of 
patients with melanoma are highly dependent on the stage at presentation.  
When  melanoma is diagnosed early  (Stage I and II) , it is generally curable with surgery 
as the treatment of choice , with a long -term survival rate of around 90% for Stage I 
melanoma (Balch et al . 2009) .  However,  most people with more advanced melanoma 
have a poor prognosis  (Finn et al . 2012) .  Patients with lymph -node involvement 
(Stage III) have a high risk of local and dista nt relapse after surgery, and the 5-year 
survival rate is 32%93% in this patient group (Gershenwald et al. 2017).  Few patients 
have metastatic disease ( Stage IV) at presentation, but some develop metastases after 
their initial definitive treatment.   Immunotherapy and targeted therapies  have  improved 
the outcome s of those patients , and the 5-year survival rate is around 50% ( Larkin et al. 
2015; Wolchok et al. 2017 ; Larkin et al. 2019; Robert et al. 2019;  Long et al. 2020 ).  
Despite recent therapeutic advances , melanoma  continues to be a serious health issue , 
with a high medical need and a steadil y increasing incidence over the past 30 years  
(Bataille  2009) . 
1.1.1 Treatment for Melanoma  
Remarkable progress has been made  in melanoma research  over the last decade .  
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) has approved  13 new melanoma 
therapies since 2011, including  both targeted and immune -based therapies (Luke et al. 
2017).  Current standard of care includes treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors  
(CPIs), either alone or in combination, as well as targeted therapies , including BRAF and 
MEK  inhibitors.  Interleukin (IL )-2, oncolytic viral, and interferon (IFN)  therapies are also 
viable treatment options  for a subset of patients.  
1.1.1.1 Targeted Therapies  
Targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy  in improving overall survival (OS)  and 
have been approved by th e FDA for the BRAF -mutant subtype of metastatic 
melanoma.  Combination therapies with BRAF and MEK inhibitors show improve d 
outcomes over treatment with a single -agent inhibitor alone.  However, most patients 
acquire resistance to therapy and relapse.  Therefore, treatment with dabrafenib  
(a selective BRAF inhibitor)  in combination with  trametinib (a selective MEK inhibitor) 
was tested in the adjuvant setting in the COMBI -AD trial in patients with BRAFV600E or 
BRAFV600K mutation -positive melanoma .  This combination  improve s relapse -free 
survival (RFS) and OS , and has been approved by the FDA for adjuvant use (Long et 
al. 2017).  In addition, there  is further improvement in progression -free survival (PFS) 
when a PD -L1 inhibitor (atezolizumab) is added to t he combination of BRAF plus MEK 
inhibitors (vemurafenib plus cobimetinib).  The Phase  III IMspire150 study of patients 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
23/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 with previously untreated BRAFV600 mutation -positive advanced melanoma 
demonstrated that the triple combination helped reduce the risk of  disease worsening or 
death compared to placebo plus vemurafenib and cobimetinib (Gutzmer et al. 2020) .  
The IMspire150  study was the first Phase III study to combin e targeted therapy and 
immunotherapy to show a benefit for  patients with  BRAFV600 mutation -positive advanced 
melanoma, and this triplet therapy has been approved by the FDA.  
1.1.1.2 Immunotherapies  
A variety of immunotherapies have been approved for the treatment of melanoma, and 
immunotherapy has shown benefit  regardless of PD -L1 expression or BRAF mutations.  
Four  CPIs , namely ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab , and relatlimab  are now 
approved by the FDA for the treatment of unresectable or advanced disease.  Each has 
shown improved  OS against different comparators.  Treatments shown to be effective in 
the unresectable or metastatic disease setting have also proven to be effective adjuvant 
therapies for patients with resectable Stage III melanomas .  The current standard of care 
is surgery followed by adjuvant anti PD-1 or targeted therapy.  
Ipilimumab,  a monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA -4, demonstrated  significant 
improvement in OS in two randomized trials (Hodi et al. 2010; Robert et al. 2011) , and 
was the first CPI approved for use in unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  It was also 
the first CPI to be approved by the FDA as adjuvant therapy, and it has demonstrated 
improved OS at a dose of 10 mg/kg when compared with placebo in the European 
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 18071 study (Eggermont et al. 
2016).  The subsequent Intergroup E1609  trial demonstrated better outcomes with 
low-dose (3 mg/kg) ipilimumab; this dose has been approved for metastatic disease 
(Tarhini et al. 2020).   Anti–PD-1 monotherapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) shows 
improved efficacy outcomes with better s afety profiles compared with treatment using 
single -agent anti CTLA -4 (ipilimumab) or  the investigator ’s choice of chemotherapy.  
Pembrolizumab was initially approved for the treatment of patients with advanced or 
unresectable melanoma who progressed after ipilimumab and/or BRAF therapy 
(Ribas  et al. 2015 a; Robert et al. 2015 b).  It is now approved for the treatment of patients 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma , as well as for the adjuvant treatment of 
patients with melanoma with lymph node involvemen t following complete resection.  
Nivolumab was originally approved in advanced melanoma patients without BRAF 
mutation (Robert et al. 2015 a).  It is now approved for patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma , and for patients with melanoma with lymph node involvement or 
metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection in the adjuvant setting.  
The combination of anti –PD-1 and anti –CTLA -4 immunotherapies (nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab) further prolonged PFS and OS compared with ipilimumab or nivolumab 
alone , and  this combination  has been approved for  previously untreated patients with 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
24/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 unresectable or metastatic melanoma (Larkin et al. 2015).  The CheckMate 238 study 
compared nivolumab with ipilimumab .  At a median f ollow -up of 51 months,  nivolumab 
improved RFS and distant metastasis -free survival while reducing toxicity.  The OS was 
similar in the two groups (Ascierto et al. 2020).  
Relatlimab is now approved with nivolumab for patients with unresectable or 
metastatic  melanoma.   The combination of relatlimab and nivolumab improved PFS 
compared to nivolumab alone  in patients  with  untreated advanced melanoma  
(Tawbi  et al. 2022).  
1.1.2 Treatment for Stage III Melanoma  
For patients with macroscopic Stage III melanoma, surgery f ollowed by adjuvant 
immunotherapy with one year of either nivolumab or pembrolizumab is generally 
indicated  (Weber et al. 2017 ; Eggermont et al. 2018) .  These agents are PD-1 inhibitors.  
For patients with a tumor that contains a BRAFV600 mutation, targeted therapy with BRAF 
and MEK inhibitors represent s an alternative therapy, especially for patients with 
Stage  III disease who are unable to receive adjuvant immunotherapy due to active 
autoimmune disease or due to the need for immunosuppre ssive therapy.  
Clinical trial data suggest that 40% of patients with macroscopic Stage III melanoma 
relapse within 3 years  after surgery (Bloemendal et al. 2019 ).  Moreover, a substantial 
subset of patients (15 %–25%) relapse soon  after surgery and bef ore s tarting adjuvant 
therapy ( Weber et al. 2017 ), resulting in a 3-year RFS of the intent -to-treat population  of 
less than 50%.   Patients with clinical  or palpable lymph node involvement have a 5 -year 
survival rate of 20% to 59%, with certain subgroups of patients (based on number of 
involved nodes, extracapsular extension, or iliac involvement in groin metastases) 
showing even worse survival rates of around 5% at 5  years (Hauschild et al. 2018; 
Ascierto et al. 2020; Eggermont et al. 2020).  
1.1.2.1 Neoadjuvant I mmunotherapy  Treatment  in Stage III Melanoma  
Nonclinical studies demonstrated improved survival and increased anti-tumor  immunity 
when immune CPI therapy was given before surgery as compared with adjuvant 
application ( Liu et al. 2016; Brockwell et al. 2017; B ourgeois -Daigneault et al. 2018; 
Brooks et al. 2018; O’Donnell et al. 2019 ).  Patients with clinically detectable Stage III 
melanoma are ideal candidates for neoadjuvant therapy because they represent a 
high-risk patient population with poor outcomes when treated with upfront surgery alone.  
Neoadjuvant therapy also has the advantage of providing information on pathologic 
response, which is valuable to estimate prognosis and to guide the choice of adjuvant 
therapy and follow -up (Tetzlaff et al. 2018 ).  Moreover, the availability of tumor tissue 
before and following therapy enables efficient exploration of possible mechanisms of 
resistance and response as well as  identification of baseline biomarkers.   Neoadjuva nt 
therapy for melanoma is now an active area of research , with numerous completed and 
ongoing trials  that have  disparate designs, endpoints, and analyses (Menzies et al. 
2021).  The International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium (INMC) was created by  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
25/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 exper ts in medical oncology, surgical oncology, pathology, radiation oncology, radiology, 
and translational research who develop ed recommendations for investigating 
neoadjuvant therapy in melanoma to align future trial designs and correlative analyses  
(Amaria e t al. 2019) . 
Six melanoma neoadjuvant trials were conducted recently with BRAF/MEK -targeted 
therapy or PD -1-based immunotherapy (reviewed by Amaria et al. 2019).  These trials 
demonstrated that neoadjuvant therapies can achieve high pathologic complete 
response  (pCR) rates and impressive RFS in Stage III melanoma (Menzies et al. 2021 ; 
Rozeman et al. 2021 ).  The i nitial data are particularly promising for the neoadjuvant 
combination of nivolumab plus ip ilimumab.  Treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
results in pathologic response rates (pRRs)  between 70 %80%, is well tolerated, and 
may reduce surgical morbidity (Rozeman et al. 2019; Blank et al. 2020).  
This study protocol was developed in accordance with INMC guidelines to create the 
needed consistenc y amongst neoadjuvant trials in order to facilitate optimal data 
organization for future regulatory review.  Its exploratory analysis plan will strengthen 
translational research across the melanoma disease continuum.  
1.1.2.2 Treatment for Metastatic Melanoma  
Curre nt standard of care includes treatment with immune CPIs , either alone or in 
combination, as well as  treatment with  targeted BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapies .  IL-2, 
oncolytic viral, and IFN therapy remain options for a subset of patients.  Radiation 
therapy may have a palliative role for symptomatic localized areas of disease.  Cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (single agent or combination) has not been shown to improve OS in 
patients with advanced melanoma.  Response rates are typically less than 20 %, and 
median response durations are 4 to 6 months.  Consequently, the role of chemotherapy 
(e.g., dacarbazine, temozolomide, carboplatin/paclitaxel, and fotemustine) is limited to 
patients who have progressed after optimal treatment with other systemic ther apy 
options.  
1.2 STUDY RATIONALE  
This randomized Phase Ib/II umbrella study is designed to accelerate the development 
of treatment s or treatment combinations by identifying early signals and establishing 
proof -of-concept clinical data in patients with resectab le melanoma .  Single -agent 
immune CPI s or targeted therapies , dual CPI combinations , and CPI s in combination 
with targeted therapies have shown promising objective response rates ( ORRs ) and OS 
and are approved for use in patients with melanoma . 
The currently prevailing cancer immun otherapy ( CIT) approach is to circumvent immune 
evasion mechanisms and reinvigorate anti -tumor responses by targeting T -cell inhibitory 
factors such as PD -1/PD -L1.  Other approaches build on the removal or inhibition of 
tumor -promoting cell types or employ  immune stimulation via cytokines, engagement of 
costimulatory receptors, or antibody -directed T -cell activation.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
26/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 CIT has demonstrated clear clinical efficacy, with significant survival benefit observed 
across multiple advanced malignancies, and there is evidence that PD -1/PD -L1 
checkpoint blockade can generate pCR and durable responses in patients with 
melanoma  (Rozeman et al . 2019 ; Blank et al . 2020 ).  Although  these targets have 
resulted in re markable clinical therapeutic success for various cancer indications, 
ongoing research indicates that a serie s of stepwise events is necessary for the 
generation of an effective anti-tumor immune response (Chen and Mellman 2013).  Each 
event is critical for an effective response, and each is also susceptible to several tumor 
immune -evasion mechanisms.  Thus, the need to identify and circumvent the various 
factors that account for the absence of, or escape from, an effective anti -cancer immune 
response wil l be critical for propagating cancer immunity and advancing the field of CIT.  
The combination of PD-1/PD -L1 blocking  with agents targeting different immune -evasion 
mechanisms may further  increase response rates and decrease rates of disease 
recurrence in this population.  
The potential risks for patients will be immune -related adverse events associated with 
the study treatments.   Adverse events could potentially impact the timely conduct of 
surgery.   Further, although post-surgery recovery could be altered when applying 
neoadjuvant CIT, these theoretical concerns have not been borne out by  data from 
recent studies in the neoadjuvant setting (Blank et al. 2018; Rozeman et al. 2019) .  
The current study is designed with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as novel 
treatment combinations become available and to close existing treatment arms that 
demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity.  Enrollment of multiple 
experimenta l arms within a single study, rather than one or two  experimental arms within 
multiple studies, will result in an overall reduction in the number of patients receiving 
control arm treatment.  More importantly, this study will assess the importance of 
simul taneously targeting multiple mechanisms of immune escape through immune cell 
priming and activation, tumor infiltration, and/or recognition of tumor cells for elimination.  
To improve the confidence of clinical signal detection in the experimental arms, th is 
study will include a control arm  (currently available in Cohort  1).

1.3 COVID-19 BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT  
In the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) pandemic, patients with 
comorbidities, including those with cancer, are considered a more vulnerable population, 
with the potential for more severe clinical outcomes from severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) infection .  Ho wever, it is unclear whether or how 
systemic cancer therapies such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy 
impact the incidence or severity of SARS -CoV-2. 
A possible consequence of immune checkpoint inhibition may be the modulation of the 
host immune response to acute infection, which may result in immunopatholog y or 
dysregulated immune defenses .  In nonclinical models, PD -1/PD -L1 blockade appears to 
be associated with serious exacerbation of inflammation in the setting of acute 
(as opposed to c hronic) viral infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Clone 13) 
(Frebel  et al. 2012).  However, there are insufficient and inconsistent clinical data to 
assess if outcome from SARS -CoV-2 is altered by CIT. 
Severe SARS -CoV-2 appears to be a ssociated with a cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) 
involving the inflammatory cytokines IL -6, IL-10, IL -2, and IFN- (Merad and 
Martin  2020).  While it is not known , there may be a potential for an increased risk of an 
enhanced inflammatory response if a patient develops acute SARS -CoV-2 infection 
while receiving immune CPI therapies (e.g.,  atezolizumab , tiragolumab , and 
RO7247669 ).  At this time, there is insufficient evidence for causal association between  
immune CPI therapies  and an increased risk of se vere outcomes from SARS -CoV-2. 
There may be potential synergy or overlap in clinical and radiologic features for 
immune -mediated pulmonary toxicity with immune CPI therapies and clinical and 
radiologic features for SARS -CoV-2related interstitial pneumonia .  Thus, investigators 
should use their clinical judgment when evaluating and managing patients with 
pulmonary symptoms.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
28/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 There is a paucity of data concerning the possible interactions between CIT treatment 
and COVID -19 vaccination, and it is recognized that human immune responses are 
highly regulated and that immune -modifying therapies could positively or negatively 
impact COVID -19 vaccination efficacy and safety ( Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 
[SITC] 2020 ). 
Per the recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) 
COVID -19 Vaccination Advisory Committee, COVID -19 vaccination is recommended for 
all patients with cancer receiving active therapy (including immune CPIs ) with the 
understanding that the re are limited safety and efficacy data in these patients 
(NCCN  COVID -19 vaccination and cancer patients).  Given the lack of clinical data, 
currently no recommendations can be made regarding the optimal sequence of 
COVID -19 vaccine and treatment with CIT (SITC 2020 ). 
For patients enrolling in this study with atezolizumab , tiragolumab, and RO7247669 , the 
decision to administer the vaccine should be individualized by the physicians i n 
consultation with the patient, based on the risk of SARS -CoV-2 infection/complications 
and potential benefit from the vaccine, the general condition of the patient, underlying 
disease, and the severity of COVID -19 outbreak in a given area/region.  For further 
details on permitted and pr ohibited therapies, see Sections  A11–4.2 
(nivolumab   ipilimumab [Nivo   Ipi]), A12–4.2 (RO7247669  2100 mg ), A13–4.2 
(atezolizumab   tiragolumab [Atezo   Tira]), A14–4.2 (RO7247669  2100  mg   Tira 
Cohorts  1 and 2 ), A15–4.2 (RO7247669 600  mg), and A16–4.2 
(RO7247669  600 mg  Tira) .  The SITC  and NCCN recommendations referenced above 
and institutional guidelines should be considered by the investigator in decision making.  
When administered, SARS -CoV-2 vaccines must be given in accordance with the 
approved or authorized vaccine label.   Receipt of the SARS -CoV-2 vaccine is 
considered a concomitant medication and should be documented as such (Section  4.4).

34/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY 
3.1.1 Overview of Study Design  
This is a Phase Ib/II, open -label, multicenter, randomized, umbrella study in patients with 
resectable Stage III (Cohort 1) or Stage IV (Cohort 2) melanoma .  The study is designed 
with the flexibility to open new treatment arms as new treatments become available, 
close existing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable 
toxicity, modify the patient population (e.g.,  with regard to prior anti -cancer treatment or  
biomarker status) , or introduce additional cohorts of patients with other types of 
melanoma.  
When additional treatment options become  available , patients may be eligible to receive 
treatment with a different treatment combination in an additional study st age (Stage  2).  
When a Stage 2 treatment is available, this will be introduced by amending the protocol . 
Two cohorts will be enrolled in parallel in this study .  Cohort 1  will enroll patients  with 
resectable Stage III melanoma with measurable lymph node me tastases according to 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST  v1.1)  that can be 
biopsied , who have  no history of in -transit metastases within the last 6 months , and  who 
have not received systemic CIT for their disease , e.g. , PD-1/PD -L1 and/or CTLA -4 
blocking  agents  or other agents .  Cohort 2 will enroll patients with Stage IV melanoma 
who experienced disease progression  during or after at least one but not more than two 
lines of treatment for metastatic disease .  Up to two lines of checkpoint inhibition therapy 
(monotherapy or combination therapy) are allowed.  Patients with BRAF -mutant disease 
may have received an additional line of targeted therapy (either before , intermittent with,  
or after the checkpoint inhibition therapy) or may have received targeted therapy and 
checkpoint inhibition therapy concurrently as one combination treatment.   Patients with 
BRAF -mutant melanoma with rapidly progressive disease who have not been previousl y 
treated with approved targeted therapies are not eligible.  
In each cohort,  eligible patients will be assigned to one of several treatment arms 
(see Section  3.1.2 ).  For the study design, see  Figure  1.

36/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  3.1.2 Treatment Assignmen t 
In Cohort 1, p atients  will be randomly assig ned to a control arm (nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab [N ivo   Ipi]) or an experimental arm consisting of RO7247669  2100 mg , 
atezolizumab in combination with tiragolumab (Atezo   Tira), RO7247669  2100 mg  in 
combination with tiragolumab (RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira), RO7247669 600 mg, or  
RO7247669 600 mg in combination with tiragolumab (RO7247669 600 mg   Tira) .  
Patients will be stratified by geographic region (Australia vs . Rest of the World) and 
baseline L DH ( the upper limit of normal [ULN] vs .  ULN).   Details on the treatment 
regimens are provided in  the respective appendices,  Appendix  11 through Appendix  16, 
as specified in Table  4 and Figure  2. 
In Cohort 2, patients  will be enrolled  into an experimental arm consisting of 
RO7247669  2100 mg  in combination with tiragolumab ( RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira).  
Enrollment will begin with a 6 -patient safety run -in phase.   Patients from French 
investigational sites are excl uded from the safety run -in phase and may only be enrolled 
into the preliminary phase, which succeeds the safety -run-in.  Details on the treatment 
regimens are provided i n Appendix  14 as specified in Table  4 and Figure  2. 
Approximately 203336 patients will be enrolled during the study , including 
approximately 6 patients who will be enrolled in the safety run -in phase of Cohort 2 .  
Enrollment within the experimental arms will take place in two phases:  a preliminary 
phase, followed by an expansion phase.  For most arms, approximately 20  patients will 
be enrolled during the preliminary phase.  Approximately 40  patients will be enrolled 
in the RO7247669 600 mg and RO7247669 600 m g  Tira arm s during the preliminary 
phase to ensure a more precise benefitrisk assessment in arms with the lower dose of 
RO7247669 .  If clinical activity (pathologic  response in Cohort 1)  is observed in an 
experimental arm during the preliminary phase, approximately 20  additional patients 
may be enrolled in that arm during the expansion phase.  
The Sponsor may decide to delay or suspend enrollment within a given treatment arm.  
Experimental arms with insufficient clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity will not be 
expanded.  Additional patients may be enrolled to ensure balance among treatment 
arms with respe ct to demographic and baseline characteristics, including potential 
predictive biomarkers, in order to enable further subgroup analyses.  New experimental 
arms may be added during the study by amending the protocol.  
The randomization ratio will depend on t he number of experimental arms that are 
available (e.g.,  if an arm is added or enrollment in an arm is suspended, pending 
analysis of results from the preliminary phase), with the stipulation that the likelihood of 
being allocated to the control arm is no more than 35%.  Randomization will take into 
account arm -specific exclusion criteria.  Patients will be ineligible for a specific arm if 
they meet any of the exclusion criteria outlined for that arm (see  Section  4.1.2 ).  Details 
on treatment assignment and randomization are provided in  Section  4.2.

a The Sponsor may decide to delay or suspend enrollment within a given treatment arm.  Thus, all experime ntal arms may not be open for 
enrollment at the same time.  
b During the safety run -in phase, patients will be assigned to available treatment arms.  The treatment assignment ratio will depend on the 
number of experimental arms that are open for enrollment (see Section  4.2 for more information).  
c The randomization ratio will depend on the number of experimental arms that are open for randomization (e.g., if an arm is add ed or 
randomization into an arm is suspen ded pending analysis of results from the preliminary phase), with the stipulation that the likelihood of being 
allocated to the control arm is no more than 35%.  See Section  4.2 for more information.  
d If clinical activity is observed in an experimental arm during the preliminary phase, approximately 20  additional patients will be enrolled in that 
arm during the expansion phase .  Experimen tal arms with minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity will not undergo expansion.  
e Enrollment  will be suspended in the Cohort 1 RO7247669  2100 mg , Atezo   Tira, and RO7247669  2100  mg   Tira arms to allow for a safety 
evaluation in a minimum of 6 patients (see  Section  3.1.3 ). 
f Enrollment in the RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira arm will open in Cohort 1 after safety assessment of the treatment combination in Cohort 2.

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
39/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  In Cohort 1, patients in the control arm and the experimental arms will receive 
neoadjuvant treatment during a 6 -week period.  After completion of neoadjuvant 
treatment, or in case of discontinuation due to toxicity and in absence of disease 
progression, patients will undergo surgery (completion lymph node dissection [CLND]) in 
Week 7.  After the treatment completion/discontinuation vis it and at the discretion of the 
investigator, patients will start either adjuvant therapy or observation  (see Figure  3).  
Because of the possib ility of an initial increase in the size of metastatic lymph nodes 
caused by immune -cell infiltration in the context of a T -cell response (termed 
pseudoprogression) with CITs, suspected clinical or radiographic progression per 
RECIST  v1.1 may not be indica tive of true disease progression.  In the absence of 
unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet the criteria for disease progression per 
RECIST  v1.1 while receiving treatment with a CIT drug will be permitted to continue 
study treatment until surgery.  Before discontinuation of study treatment and/or 
cancellation of surgery, progression should be confirmed by biopsy or repeated 
radiographic assessment by an additional expert reviewer.  All patients are expected to 
proceed with surgery, provided that there are  no distant metastases and the surgeon 
considers the disease to be completely resectable.  
In Cohort 2, patients will continue to receive treatment until unacceptable toxicity or loss 
of clinical benefit  as determined by the investigator after an integrated  assessment of 
radiographic and biochemical data, local biopsy results (if  available), and clinical status 
(e.g., symptomatic deterioration such as pain secondary to disease).  Because of the 
possibility of an initial increase in tumor burden caused by imm une-cell infiltration in the 
setting of a T -cell response (termed pseudoprogression) with atezolizumab and other 
CITs, radiographic progression per RECIST  v1.1 may not be indicative of true disease 
progression.  In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, pat ients who meet criteria for 
disease progression per RECIST  v1.1 while receiving treatment with a CIT combination 
will be permitted to continue treatment if they meet all of the following criteria:  
 Evidence of clinical benefit , as determined by the investig ator following a review of 
all available data  
 Absence of symptoms and signs (including laboratory values, such as new or 
worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease  
 Absence of decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance 
Status that can be attributed to disease progression  
 Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal 
disease) that cannot be managed by protocol -allowed medical interventions  
 
Patients  eligible for treatment beyond progression will be informed by the investigator 
that they may be foregoing other treatment options known to confer clinical benefit while 
continuing to receive the study treatment.  Patients have the right to voluntarily wit hdraw 
from the study at any time for any reason.  In addition, the investigator has the right to 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
40/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 withdraw a patient from the study for medical conditions that the investigator or Sponsor 
determines may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he/she continues in  the study.  
If at a subsequent tumor assessment, pseudoprogression is ruled out and progression of 
the disease is confirmed, the patient will be discontinued from study treatment.

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
42/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  3.1.3 Safety Evaluation Phase  (Cohort 1)  
To evaluate  the toxicities  of the experimental treatments in the neoadjuvant setting , 
enrollment  will be suspended after approximately  6 patients have been enrolled to allow 
for a safety evaluation .   
The safety evaluation will be based on safety data from a minimum of 6  patients who 
have received at least one dose of treatment (i.e., one dose  of each agent for a given 
combination) and who have completed safety follow -up assessments until surgery .  
Notably , timely conduct of surgery (CLND)  is an indicator of treatment tolerability.   
During the 6 -patient safety evaluation , or following safety evaluation s, if  30% of 
patients experience one or more of the following events  that is  considered to be at least 
possibl y related to study treatment, enrollment for that combination will be put on hold 
while the Sp onsor evaluates the benefit risk profile of that treatment:  
 A treatment -related Grade   3 adverse event that does not improve  (with or without 
treatment ) to Grade  2 or better within 2  weeks  
 A treatment -related adverse event causing   2-week delay in surgery  
 A treatment -related serious adverse event  
 A treatment -related adverse event that requires permanent discontinuation of study 
drug 
 Death , exce pt those that are incontrovertibly related to disease progression or 
extraneous causes such as accidents  
 
If no new safety signals are detected, enrollment will be resumed in that arm.  
For the same study drug  or study drug combination , if a higher dose arm  has passed  the 
safety evaluation for a minimum of 6 patients, enrollment will be not suspended after 
6 patients are enrolled in the lower dose arms pending the outcome of the safety 
evaluation .  However,  the Sponsor will still conduct a formal safety evaluation from a 
minimum of 6  patients who have received at least one dose of treatment (i.e., one dose of 
each agent for a given combination) and who have completed safety follow -up 
assessments until surgery .  The  stopping rules outlined above will also apply to the 
lower dose arms at this safety evaluation.    
3.1.4 Safety Run -In Phase (Cohort 2 ) 
To assess the safety and tolerability  of novel combinations  that are tested clinically for 
the first time , an initial safety run -in phase will be implemented in Cohort  2.  
Approximately 6 patients with metastatic disease will be treated with the novel 
combination and assessed for safety and tolerability for a minimum of 28 days.  
A minimum of 6 patients in Cohort 2  must complete the initial safety run -in phase .  If the 
combination is determined to be tolerable , enrollment for the preliminary phase may be 
opened,  and the same  arm in Cohort 1 can be opened for enrollment (refer to  
Section  3.1.2  for details).  Patients in the safety run -in phase  will be enrolled and treated 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
43/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 in a sequential manner , with at least one week between the first patient and the 
remaining patients.  
The assessm ent will be based on safety data from a minimum of 6  patients who have 
received at least one dose of treatment (i.e., one dose  of each agent) and who have 
completed safety follow -up assessments for at least 28 days.   During the 6 -patient safety 
run-in phase, or following safety evaluations, i f  30% of patients experience  one or more 
of the following events that is considered to be at least possibl y related to study 
treatment, enrollment for that combination will be put on hold while the Sponsor 
evaluat es the benefit risk profile of that treatment:  
 A treatment -related Grade   3 adverse event that does not improve  (with or without 
treatment ) to Grade  2 or better within 2  weeks  
 A treatment -related serious adverse event  
 A treatment -related adverse event that requires permanent discontinuation of study 
drug 
 Death , except those  that are  incontrovertibly  related to disease progression  or 
extraneous causes such as accidents  
 
If no new safety signals are detected, the combination will also be initiated in Cohort 1 . 
3.1.5 Assessments and Monitoring  
All patients will be closely monitored for adver se events throughout the study.  A dverse 
events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE v5.0).   CRS s everity will also be 
graded according to the American  Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy  
(ASTCT ) CRS Consensus Grading Scale.  
Patients in Cohort 1 will receive neoadjuvant treatment for 2 cycles ( 6 weeks ) and will 
undergo s urgery (CLND) in Week 7.  All patients are expected to proceed with surgery, 
provided that there are no distant metastases and the surgeon considers the disease to 
be completely resectable.   Pathologic response will be assessed locally and by 
independent pathologic review.  
Patients who discontinue treatment due to unacceptable toxicity and continue to have  no 
evidence of metastatic  disease  will still be eligible for surgery and proceed with CLND 
after the adverse event has resolved  and r e-staging  confirm s Stage III disease.   
If patients  have confirmed disease progress ion, patient management and treatment 
selection will be at the discretion of the treating physician.   These patients will remain in 
the study for follow -up. 
Patients will undergo radiological tumor assessments in Week 6 (from Day 1 of Cycle 1) 
prior to surgery  (CLND ) (see Section  4.5.7  for details).  Response will be assessed and 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
44/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 determined  by the investigator  in accordance with RECIST v1.1 , but confirmation  by 
later imaging studies  is not required  (see Appendix  1). 
Patients in Cohort 2 will undergo tumor assessments every 9 weeks (from Day 1 of 
Cycle 1) for the first 54 weeks  and then every 12 weeks thereafter (see Section  4.5.7 ).  
Response will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1  (see Appendix  1).  
Response per modified RECIST v1.1 for immune -based therapeutics (iRECIST)  (see 
Appendix  2) will be determined programmatica lly by the Sponsor on the basis of 
investigator -assessed individual lesion data.  
For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, i f clinical activity is demonstrated in an experimental arm, the 
Sponsor may request that tumor assessment scans for that arm and the corresponding 
control arm be submitted for evaluation by an independent review facility.  
For all patients, b lood samples will be collected at baseline and during the study for 
biomarker research, including blood -based next -generation sequencing (NGS) and 
circulating tum or DNA (ctDNA) testing . 
Tumor and blood samples will be collected at baseline and during the study for 
biomarker assessments.  Baseline tumor tissue samples will  be collected from all 
patients  (except patients in the Cohort 2 safety run -in phase ) by biopsy  of a metastatic 
lymp h node (Cohort 1) or other metastatic lesion (Cohort 2) at screening.  In addition,  
archival primary tumor tissue will be submitted  from all patients  if availabl e.  For patients 
in Cohort 1, o n-treatment tissue samples will  be collecte d by biopsy on Day  1 of Cycle 2  
(up to 72 hours prior to drug administration) , and at surgery (CLND) .  For patients 
enrolled in Cohort 2, on -treatment tissue samples will be collected by biopsy on Day 8 of 
Cycle 2 .  These samples will be utilized for biomarker research (see rationale for 
biomarker assessments in Section  3.4.7  and details on tissue sample collection in 
Section  4.5.9 ).  If possible, baseline screening samples should be collected  after all 
other screening assessments have been evaluated for eligibility.  
To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties an d/or immunogenicity of 
atezolizumab and the other therapeutic agents, blood samples will be taken at various 
timepoints before and during study treatment administration.  
On the basis of a review of real -time safety data and available PK data, treatment 
regimens may be modified by the Sponsor as deemed appropriate.  
The schedule of activities for each treatment arm is presented in Sections  A11–6 
(Nivo   Ipi), A12–6 (RO7247669  2100 mg ), A13–6 (Atezo   Tira), A14–6 
(RO7247669  2100  mg   Tira Cohort  1), A14–8 (RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort  2), 
A15–6 (RO7247669 600  mg), and A16–6 (RO7247669  600 mg   Tira) . 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
45/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 3.1.6 Internal Monitoring Committee  
An Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) will monitor  patient safety throughout the study.  
The IMC will include representatives from clinical science, safety science, and 
biostatistics.  In addition to the ongoing assessment of the incidence, nature, and 
severity of adverse events, serious adverse events, d eaths, and laboratory abnormalities 
performed by the investigator and the Medical Monitor, the IMC will review all necessary 
cumulative data at regular intervals during the study.  At the time of each review, the 
IMC will make appropriate recommendations ( e.g., the study should continue as 
planned, enrollment in a specific arm should be discontinued, a treatment regimen 
should be modified, the protocol should be amended, or enrollment should be held 
pending further safety evaluations).  Decisions will be ma de in consideration of the 
totality of the available data.  Ad -hoc meetings may be called in addition to scheduled 
meetings, as necessary, to provide recommendations on management of any new safety 
issues.  Specific operational details such as the committe e's composition, frequency and 
timing of meetings, and members' roles and responsibilities will be detailed in an IMC 
Charter.  
3.1.7 Scientific Oversight Committee  
A Scientific Oversight Committee (SOC) will act as a consultative body to the Sponsor, 
providing e xternal expert opinions on the safety data collected during the study.  This 
committee will consist of an external group of at least three oncology experts in CIT who 
will advise the Sponsor on the interpretation of study data.  For this purpose, the SOC 
will evaluate aggregate safety data on a periodic basis, approximately every 6 months 
from the time the first patient is enrolled in the study.  Members will follow a charter that 
outlines their roles and responsibilities.  Data being evaluated by the SOC w ill include 
demographic, adverse event, serious adverse event, and relevant laboratory data.  The 
SOC may review efficacy data if safety concerns necessitate benefit risk assessments.  
The Sponsor will retain all decision -making authority for this study.  
3.1.8 Independent Pathology Review 
An Independent Pathology Review Facilit y (or facilities)  (IPRF [s]) will perform an 
independent review of resection tissue, and other clinical data as needed, for the primary 
efficacy analyses.  Review will be performed accordin g to the guidelines of Pathologic 
Assessment of Resection Specimens After Neoadjuvant Therapy for Metastatic 
Melanoma  (Appendix  3) IPRF membership and procedures will be detailed in an I PRF 
charter.  
3.2 END OF STUDY  AND LENGTH OF STUDY  
The end of this study is defined as the date when the last patient completes the last visit, 
including long-term follow -up visits conducted by telephone or in the clinic . 
The total length of the study, from screening of the first patient to the end of the study, is 
expected to be approximately 5 years.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
46/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 3.3 DURATION OF PARTICIP ATION 
In Cohort 1, the total duration of study participation for each individual from screening

study).  
   
3.4 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
3.4.1 Rationale for Patient Population  
Cohort 1 will enroll patients with resectable Stage III melanoma with measurable lymph 
node metastases (according to RECIST v1.1 ) that can be biopsied , and who have no 
history of in -transit metastases within the last 6 months .  Enrolled patients must  not have 
received prior immunotherapy for their disease.  
This same patient population was enrolled in the OpACIN and OpACIN -neo studies , 
including the PRADO extension cohort .  These studies evaluat ed the neoadjuvant (and 
adjuvant ) combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with resectable 
melanoma.  Neoadjuvant  therapy was found to have  a statistically significant and 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
47/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 clinically meaningful benefit as compared with  adjuvant therapy  (Rozeman et al. 2019; 
Blank et al. 2020; R ozeman et al. 2021 ).  In addition,  the safety profile  of the treatment 
was found to be tolerable  in an optimized treatment schedule.  
Despite the recently demonstrated benefit of checkpoint inhibition therapy, there is a 
continuing need for treatment regime ns that are more efficacious (i.e. , broader and 
deeper pathologic  response in the surgical specimen) and better tolerated for patients 
with resectable melanoma.  The multiple treatment options  in this study are expected to 
stimulate the immune system throu gh a variety of mechanisms  (see Appendix  11 
through Appendix  16 for more details).   The aim is to extend the benefit of CIT beyond 
that of current checkpoint inhibition to a larger population with resectable melanoma.  
Cohort 2 will enroll pat ients with  Stage IV melanoma who experienced disease 
progression  during or after at least one but not more than two lines of treatment for 
metastatic disease .  Up to two  lines of checkpoint inhibition  therapy (monotherapy or 
combination therapy) are allowed.   Patient s with BRAF -mutant disease may have 
receive d an additional line of target ed therapy  (either before , intermittent with, or after  
the checkpoint inhibition therapy)  or may have received targeted therapy and checkpoint 
inhibition  therapy con currently as one combination treatment.   Patients with 
BRAF -mutant melanoma with rapidly progressive disease who have not been previously 
treated with approved targeted therapies are not eligible.  
Novel combinations of compound s with a clinical and/or biological rationale for 
anti-melanoma activity that have not yet been tested clinically will be investigated in 
Cohort 2.  Importantly, for individual compounds considered for novel combinations, 
safety and tolerability have been already established in other studies  and a safe dose 
and schedule are available.   The Cohort 2 safety run -in phase will assess the safety of 
the novel combination with regards to potential overlapping toxicities  (see Section  3.1.4  
for details) . 
3.4.2 Rationale for Immunotherapy -Based Treatment beyond Initial 
Radiographic Progression  
In studies of immunotherapeutic agents, complete response ( CR), partial response ( PR), 
and stable disease  (SD) have each been shown to occur after radiographic evidence of 
an apparent increase in tumor burden.  This initial increase in tumor burden caused by  
immune -cell infiltration in the setting of a T -cell response has been termed 
pseudoprogression (Hales et al. 2010).  In Study PCD4989g, evidence of tumor growth 
followed by a response was observed in several tumor types.   In addition, in some 
responding patients with radiographic evidence of progression, biopsies of new lesions 
or areas of new growt h in existing lesions revealed immune cells and no viable cancer 
cells.  
In Co hort 1, b ecause of the possibility of an initial increase in the size of metastatic 
lymph nodes caused by immune -cell infiltration in the context of a treatment elicited 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
48/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 T-cell re sponse in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet the criteria 
for disease progression in the target lymph node metastases per RECIST  v1.1 while 
receiving treatment with a CIT drug will be permitted to continue study treatment until 
surgery .  However, the appearance of n ovel, previously undetected non -lymph node 
lesions  may indicate that the patient has in fact been understaged and rather presents 
with more advanced or Stage IV disease.   Because of the potential for a response after 
pseudoprogression, this study will allow patients randomly allocated to immunotherapy -
based treatment arms to continue combination treatment after apparent radiographic 
progression per RECIST v1.1, provided th e benefitrisk ratio is judged to be favorable by 
the investigator (see criteria in  Section  3.1.2 ).  Patients should be discontinued for  
unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator after an 
integrated assessment of radiographic and biochemical data, local biopsy results (if 
available), and clinical status (see Section  3.1.2  for details).  
3.4.3 Rationale for the Use of Modified RECIST for Immune -Based 
Therapeutics  
Increasing clinical experience indicates that traditional response criteria 
(e.g.,  RECIST  v1.1 and World Health Organization criteria) may not adequately assess 
the activity of immunotherapeutic agents because initial radiographic evidence of 
disease progression does not necessarily reflect therapeutic failure.  Patients can 
exper ience a response in the presence of new lesions or after an increase in tumor 
burden.  Thus, this study will employ iRECIST (Seymour et al. 2017 ; see Appendix  2), 
tumor response criteria that have been modified for unconventional tumor change 
patterns associated with CIT.  
iRECIST was developed by the RECIST working group in an effort to create a common 
set of crite ria that the CIT field could apply to clinical trials (Seymour et al. 2017).  
iRECIST accounts for responses that may occur following transient radiographic 
progression caused by immune -cell infiltration in tumors (leading to a transient increase 
in the si ze of existing lesions, including those that were previously undetectable and 
consequently appear as new lesions).  iRECIST relies on collection of tumor assessment 
data after initial disease progression per RECIST  v1.1.  
Given the proposed immunomodulatory  mechanism -of-action of atezolizumab and other 
CPIs and the possibility of observing delayed responses, exploratory efficacy endpoints 
will include analyses based on iRECIST.  These analyses will allow for evaluation of 
iRECIST as an improved measure of th e efficacy of immunotherapies relative to 
standard RECIST v1.1.  
3.4.4 Rationale for Neoadjuvant Treatment in Melanoma  in Cohort 1  
Neoadjuvant therapy has several potential  advantages over adjuvant therapy, and could 
even be superior  to adjuvant therapy  in this patient population .  In particular, using 
neoadjuvant therapy could allow investigators  to determine therapy efficacy in individual 
patient s, which could guide the use  of additional adjuvant therapy, if needed .  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
49/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 Neoadjuvant therapy could also  reduce tumor burden before surgery , and the  pathologic 
response data could be used as surrogate outcome markers for RFS and OS.  In the 
case of T -cell checkpoint blockade, neoadjuvant therapies could have a potentially 
significant advantage.  T -cell checkpoint -blocking antibodies enhance T -cell activation 
when an antigen is encountered.  Drug exposure during the time the major tumor mass 
is still present may therefore potentially induce a stronger and broader tumor -specific 
T-cell response (Blank et al. 2018).  Indeed, preclinical data provided support for the 
superior activity of T -cell checkpoint blockade when given before surgery (Liu et al. 
2016).  
Data from the recent OpACIN and OpACIN -neo studies show that two cycles of 
neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab  without additional adjuvant therapy induces 
durable RFS in more than 80% of patients , and further endorse pathologic response as 
a strong surrogate outcome marker for RFS ( Rozeman et al. 2021 ). 
3.4.5 Rationale for Pathologic  Response  Rate as Primary Endpoint  
in Cohort 1  
The pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy is a surrogate endpoint of improved 
patient outcomes in the treatment of several cancer types.  The majority of neoadjuvant 
studies that are ongoing in melanoma are testing immunotherapy and use p athologic 
response as an endpoint (Mueller et al. 2021).  
Several studies, including OpACIN and OpACIN -neo, have shown that pathologic 
response appears to be a strong surrogate marker for long -term benefit.  A pooled 
analysis of the INMC confirmed that path ologic response strongly correlates with RFS 
and OS with neoadjuvant therapy in Stage III melanoma.  It is further reported that 
particularly with combination immunotherapy , any degree of pathologic response with 
immunotherapy is sufficient to confer excel lent survival.  
Six neoadjuvant melanoma studies were conducted recently  with BRAF/MEK -targeted 
therapy or PD -1-based immunotherapy , and demonstrated that neoadjuvant therapies 
achieve high pCR rates and RFS in Stage III melanoma.   In the pooled analysis, p CR 
occurred in 40% of patients:  47% with targeted therapy and 33% with immunotherapy 
(43% combination and 20% monotherapy).  pCR correlated with improved RFS (pCR 
2-year 89% vs . no pCR 50%, p  0.001) and OS (pCR 2 -year OS 95% vs . no pCR 83%, 
p  0.027).   In patients achieving a pathologic  response with immunotherapy, very few 
relapses were seen (2 -year RFS 96%), and no patient ha d died from melanoma at time 
of the report .  With pCR from targeted therapy, the 2 -year RFS was only 79%, and OS 
was only 91%  (Menzies et al. 2021) . 
3.4.6 Rationale for Using Nivo   Ipi as Comparator  in Cohort 1  
No standard of care exists for neoadjuvant treatment of resectable melanoma .  The 
highest pathologic response rates have been observed in Stage IV disease and  in 
Stage III disease in the neoadjuvant setting  with the combination of nivolumab and 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
50/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 ipilimumab (Menzies et al . 2021) .  As pathologic response (especially pCR, but also 
near pCR) emerge s as a potential surrogate endpoint for RFS benefit,  the combination 
of nivolumab a nd ipilimumab was chosen as the active comparator for this study.  
In addition, g iven the positive data in several studies and the approval of the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for patients with advanced melanoma, this 
combination was considered  to be  the best comparator for the anticipated patient 
population in this study (Wolchok et al. 2013; Sznol et al. 2014).   Further more , a Phase 
III study with the objective of establishing  nivolumab combined with ipilimumab as a 
standard of care option for  neoadjuvant therapy is planned (NADINA Trial).  
The recommended dose  for advanced melanoma is 1 mg/kg nivolumab and 3  mg/kg 
ipilimumab.  This study will use alternative dosing of 3  mg/kg nivolumab and 1  mg/kg 
ipilimumab  because this dosing schedule induced  a lower rate of immune -mediated 
toxicity  in the OpACIN -neo study , and thus was identified  as the optimal dosing regimen 
in the neoadjuvant setting  (Rozeman et al. 2019) . 
Randomized studies evaluating immunotherapy combinations will allow us to identify 
safe and effective neoadjuvant treatments for pa tients with resectable melanoma  while 
also significantly increasing our understanding of cancer biology.  
3.4.7 Rationale for Biomarker Assessments  
Blood samples for biomarker assessments will be collected at baseli ne and during the 
study.  Changes in biomarkers in blood may provide evidence of biologic activity of the 
specific treatments and treatment combinations.  Correlations between surrogate 
biomarkers in blood (such as tumor burden markers, cytokines, chemokin es, immune 
cell subpopulations, gene expression, and ctDNA ) and drug dose and efficacy and 
safety endpoints may allow for the development of a blood -based biomarker to help 
define future treatments and predict which patients are more likely to benefit from  
specific treatment combinations.  
Baseline tumor tissue samples will be collected from all patients (except patients in the 
Cohort 2 safety run -in phase) by biopsy at screening .  In addition,  on-treatment tissue 
samples will be collected  up to 72 hours pri or to drug administration . If available,  archival 
primary tumor tissue will be submitted from all patients.  
Tumor samples will be evaluated for biomarkers such as tumor -infiltrating immune cells, 
PD-L1, CD8, and expression of targets specific to each drug combination.  Evaluation of 
the tumor microenvironment in response to treatment within each arm, including 
changes in the number, locations, densities and functional status of tumor -infiltrating 
immune cells, could provide validation of the postulated mech anism -of-action , 
confirmation that an appropriate dose and exposure for the specific treatment 
combination have been achieved , and/or response prediction capacity .  Differences in 
biomarkers and lymphocyte infiltration in baseline primary tumor compared to  metastasis 
may be assessed.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
51/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 Tumor tissue and blood samples may be analyzed through use of NGS methods such as 
whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify somatic mutations that are predictive of 
response to study drug, are associated with progression to a mo re severe disease state, 
are associated with acquired resistance to study drug, are associated with susceptibility 
to developing adverse events, or can increase the knowledge and understanding of 
disease biology.  
4. MATERIALS AND METHOD S 
4.1 PATIENTS

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
59/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT  
This is a randomized, open -label study.  After initial written informed consent has been 
obtained, all screening procedures and assessments have been completed, a nd 
eligibility has been established for a patient, the study site will obtain the patient’s 
identification number and treatment assignment from the interactive web -based 
response system (IxRS).  
For Cohort 1, t his study will employ a permuted -block randomization method with 
dynamically changing randomization ratios to account for fluctuation in the number of 
treatment arms that are open for enrollment over the course of the study.  
The randomization ratio will depend on the number of experimental arm s that are open 
for enrollment (e.g., if an arm is added or enrollment in an arm is suspended pending 
analysis of results from the preliminary phase), with the stipulation that the likelihood of 
being allocated to the control arm will be no more than 35%.  The randomization ratios 
may be altered to increase enrollment in a particular arm.  
Randomization  will be stratified according to the following criteria:  
 Geographic region:  Australia vs. Rest of the World  
 Baseline LDH:   ULN vs.   ULN 
 
Randomization wil l take into account general exclusion criteria and arm -specific 
exclusion criteria as outlined in  Section  4.1.2 .  For example, the Atezo   Tira arm will be 
removed as an option for patients who are ineligible for that arm.  If a patient is  only 
eligible for the control  arm, that patient will not be enrolled in the study.  
For Cohort 2, patients will be assigned to receive treatment with  
RO72 47669  2100  mg   Tira.  If additional treatment arms are opened at a later time , a 
permuted -block randomization method will be employed  from this point forward.  
Patients who do not receive at least one dose of each drug for their assigned treatment 
regimen will not be included in the efficacy analyses.  Additional patients may be 
enrolled to reach the target number of treated patients planned for analysis.  
4.3 STUDY TREATMENT  
Details on the therapeutic agents for each treatment arm are provided in the respective  
appendix for that treatment arm, as outlined  in Table  4. 
4.3.1 Investigational Medicinal Product Handling and Accountability  
The IMPs for this study are atezolizumab, tiragolumab,  RO7247669 , nivolumab, and 
ipilimumab .  Appen dix 17 identifies all  IMPs, non -investigational medicinal products , and 
auxiliary medicinal products  for this study.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
60/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 All IMPs required for completion of this study will be provided by the Sponsor where 
required by local regulations.  The study site (i.e.,  investigator or other aut horized 
personnel [e.g., pharmacist]) is responsible for maintaining records of IMP delivery to the 
site, IMP inventory at the site, IMP use by each patient, and disposition or return of 
unused IMP, thus enabling reconciliation of all IMP received, and for  ensuring that 
patients are provided with doses specified by the protocol.  
The study site should follow all instructions included with each shipment of IMP.  
The study site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs supplied by the Sponsor using the IxRS 
to confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be 
replaced.  The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature 
conditions have been maintained during transit for all IMPs received and that any 
discrepancies have been r eported and resolved before use of the IMPs.  All IMPs must 
be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) 
area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions, with access limited to the 
investigator and authorize d staff.  
Only patients enrolled in the study may receive IMPs, and only authorized staff may 
supply or administer IMPs.  
IMPs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s institutional 
standard operating procedure or will be re turned to the Sponsor (if supplied by the 
Sponsor) with the appropriate documentation.  The site’s method of destroying 
Sponsor -supplied IMPs must be agreed to by the Sponsor.  The site must obtain written 
authorization from the Sponsor before any Sponsor -supplied IMP is destroyed, and IMP 
destruction must be documented on the appropriate form.  
Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of by 
the study site should be recorded on a drug accountability log.  
Refer to th e pharmacy manual and/or the applicable Investigator's Brochure for 
information on IMP handling, including preparation and storage, and accountability.  
4.3.2 Post-Trial Access to Study Treatment

prior to each infusion; dosing will occur only if the clinical assessment and local 
laboratory test values are acceptab le. 
4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log  
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any  study -related procedures (including screening evaluations)  and may be 
obtained more than 28 days before initiation o f study treatment .  Informed Consent 
Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be 
maintained at the study site.  
Screening evaluations are to be performed within 28 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment (Day 1 ).  All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to 
confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria before enrollment.  
Patients who fail their first screening for study  eligibility may qualify for two  re-screening 
opportunities (for a total  of three screenings per patient) at the investigator’s discretion.  
Patients must re -sign the Informed Consent Form prior to re -screening.  
Results of standard -of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed 
consent and within a specifi ed time prior to Day 1 may be used  as outlined in  the 
schedule of activities (see Appendix  10 [screening ], Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6

over-the-coun ter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional 
supplements) used by the patient within a specified time prior to initiation of study 
treatment will be recorded .  At the time of each follow -up physical examination, an 
interval medical hist ory should be obtained and any changes in medications and 
allergies should be recorded.   Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported 
race/ethnicity.  
Refer to the schedule of activities for information about the timing of medical history, 
mole cular profile, concomitant medication, and demographic data collection 
(Appendix  10 [screening], Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg ], 
A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort  1], A14–8 
[RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort  2], A15–6 [RO7247669 600 mg], and A16–6 
[RO7247669 600 mg   Tira] ). 
4.5.3 Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination, performed at screening and other specified visits, 
should include evaluation s as per clinical practice (e.g. , evaluations of the head, eyes, 
ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems ).  Any abnormality 
identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations should be performed at specified 
post-baseline visits and as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormaliti es 
should be recorded in patient notes.  
New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Height will be recorded at screening.  Weight will be recorded at specified timepoints 
during the s tudy. 
Refer to the schedule of activities for information about the timing of physical 
examinations (Appendix  10 [screening], Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 
[RO7247669  2100 mg ], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira

and A16–6 [RO7247669 600 mg   Tira] ). 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
63/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 4.5.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, and systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, pulse oximetry, and 
temperature.  
Vital signs should be measured within 60 minutes prior to administration of each study 
treatment and, if  clinically indicated, during or after treatment administration.  In addition, 
vital signs should be measured at other specified timepo ints as outlined in the schedule 
of activities (see Appendix  10 [screening], Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 
[RO7247669  2100 mg ], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira 
Cohort  1], A14–8 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort  2], A15–6 [RO7247669  600 mg], 
and A16–6 [RO7247669  600 mg   Tira] ). 
Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical  
History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.   New or worsened clinically significant 
abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
4.5.5 Electrocardiograms  
An ECG will be performed at screening, as clinically indicated, and as outlined in the 
schedules of activities (see Appendix  10 [screenin g], Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 
[RO7247669  2100 mg ], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira 
Cohort  1], A14–8 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort  2], A15–6 [RO7247669  600 mg], 
and A16–6 [RO7247669  600 mg   Tira] ).  ECGs for each patient should be obtained 
from the same machine wherever possible.  Lead placement should be as consistent as 
possible .  It is recommended that patients be  resting  in a supine position for at least 
10 minutes prior to ECG recordi ng. 
For safe ty monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG 
tracings.  Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the patient's permanent 
study file at the site.  Any morphologic waveform changes or other ECG abnormalities 
must b e documented on the eCRF.  
4.5.6 Evaluation of Left Ventricular Function  
Patients will undergo e valuation of LVEF, either by  TTE or MUGA scan  at screening  and 
as outlined in the schedules of activities (see Appendix  10 [screening], Sections  A11–6 
[Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg ], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 
[RO7247669  2100  mg   Tira Cohort  1], A14–8 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort 2], 
A15–6 [RO7247669 600 mg], and A16–6 [RO7247669 600 m g  Tira] ).  Evaluation of 
LVEF must be performed using the same method for each patient.   TTE measurements 
should be performed by the same operator whenever possible, following the most recent 
echocardiography society guidelines.  Paper copies of reports will be kept as part of the 
patient’s permanent study file at the site.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
64/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 4.5.7 Tumor and Response Evalu ations  
4.5.7.1 Radiographic Procedures for Screening  (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
All measurable and evaluable lesions should be assessed and documented at screening  
as outlined in the schedule of activities  (Appendix  10).  Tumor assessments performed 
as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to 
randomization/enrollment do not have to be repeated at screening.  
Screening assessments must include CT scans (with oral and/or IV contrast) or 
magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  A spiral 
CT scan of the chest may be obtained but is not a requirement.  If a CT scan with 
contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the 
abdomen and pelvis should be performed.  A  CT scan with contrast or MRI scan of the 
head with c ontrast must be done at screening to evaluate CNS metastasis in all patients 
(MRI scan must be performed if contrast is contraindicated).  Bone scans and CT or MRI 
scans of the neck should also be performed if clinically indicated.  At the investigator’s 
discretion, other methods of  assessment of measurable disease may be used as per 
RECIST v1.1.  
If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed in a positron emission tomography 
(PET)/CT scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a 
full-contrast diagnostic CT scan.  The same radiographic procedures used to assess 
disease sites at screening should be used for subsequent tumor assessments (e.g., the 
same contrast protocol for CT  scans).  
All measurable and/or evaluable lesions identified  at baseline should be re -assessed at 
subsequent tumor evaluations as outlined  in Section  4.5.7.2  (Cohort 1) or 
Section  4.5.7.3  (Cohort 2) .  The same radiographic procedu res used to assess disease 
sites at screening should be used for subsequent tumor assessments (e.g., the same 
contrast protocol for CT  scans).  
4.5.7.2 Cohort 1  Tumor , Response , and Disease Status  Evaluations  
Patients in Cohort 1 will be assessed for pathologic and  radiologic response to 
treatment.  Patients will undergo pathological tumor assessments after 6 weeks of 
treatment at surgery (CLND).  The complete resection of Stage III lymph nodes (CLND) 
in Week 7 must be performed in compliance with the criteria for a dequate surgical 
procedures for therapeutic lymph node dissection  (see Appendix  4).  CLND  should be 
performed as planned if the patient is receiving corticosteroids or other anti -inflammatory 
drugs  for the management of immune -mediated adverse events, provided  these  are 
being  given at a stable or tapering dose and the severity of adverse events  is Grade 2 or 
better .  CLND may be delayed for up to 2 weeks if study treatment -related adverse 
events  have not improved sufficiently at the time of planned surgery (see  Sectio n 3.1.3 ).  
Pathological response will be  determined by local and  independent  pathologic review 
according to INMC guidelines (Tetzlaff et al.  2018 ; Appendix  3). 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
65/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 Patients will undergo radiographic tumor assessments at baseline and after 6 weeks of 
treatment before surgery (CLND)  according to RECIST  v1.1, as outlined for each arm in 
the schedules of activities (see Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 
[RO7247669  2100  mg], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira 
Cohort  1], A15–6 [RO7247669  600 mg], and A16–6 [RO7247669 600 m g  Tira] ).  
At the treatment completion/discontinuation  visit (Week 13 ), the disease status will be 
assessed by radiographic tumor assessments for the absence of recurrent disease.   
Tumor assessments that have been performed outside the protocol -mandated time 
window do not have to be repeated.  However, at the investigator’s d iscretion, tumor 
assessments may be  repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected . 
Overall response at a single timepoint will be assessed by the investigator using 
RECIST v1.1  (see Appendix  1).  Assessments should be performed by the same 
evaluator, if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits.  Available results must 
be reviewed by the investigator prior to tre atment administration.  
Disease Follow -Up and Confirmation of Disease Progression or Recurrence  
During the neoadjuvant treatment, diagnosis of disease progression should be confirmed 
by clinical, laboratory, radiological, and/or histological findings.  After surgery, prior to 
commencing adjuvant treatment or observation, the first planned tumor assessment will 
be performed  in Week 13 to conclude the neoadjuvant therapy -surgery intervention 
window  and should include a CT scan .  After the treatment phase , during the follow -up 
phase , all patients must be followed to assess disease  recurrence and survival as 
outlined for each arm in the schedules of activities (see Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi],  
A12–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg ], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 [RO7247669  2100  mg   Tira 
Cohort  1], A15–6 [RO7247669 600 mg], and A16–6 [RO7247669 600 mg   Tira] ).  
Tumor assessments that have been performed outside the protocol -mandated time 
window do not have to be repeated.  However, at the investigator’s discretion, tumor 
assessments may be  repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected . 
The designation of disease recurrence, whether local, regional , or distant, can be made 
only when clinical, laboratory, radiological and/or histological findings  confirm the 
diagnosis.  
During the post -surgery period, d isease status should be clinically evaluated and 
documented every 3 months  for the first 2 years; every 6 months  in the third year  and 
annually thereafter until a diagnosis of a  recurrence (defined below ).  In addition  to 
physical examinat ions, liver function tests, bone scans, chest X -ray/diagnostic CT scan, 
liver imaging, and/or other radiographic modalities may be considered when clinically 
indicated to exclude metastatic disease  within timeline s as per current local standard of 
practice.  
The diagnosis of a progression or  recurrence should be confirmed histologically 
whenever clinically possible.  The  earliest date of diagnosis of disease progression or 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
66/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 recurrent disease  should be used and recorded .  This date should be based on objective 
clinical, radiological, histological, or cytological evidence .  Recurrent disease includes 
local, regional, or distant recurrence :  local recurrence is defined as tumor regrowth 
within 2  cm of the primary lesion’s tumor bed ; regional recurrence  as any nodal or 
non-nodal tumor lesions that are more than 2 cm from the primary lesion but are not 
beyond the regional nodal basin ; distant recurrence  as any non -local/non -regional 
recurrence.  
The definitions of and procedures for confirming disease recurrence, death, and other 
noteworthy events on follow -up are provided below .  Documentation of recurrence will 
require specification of all sites involved to establish the pattern of recurrence.  
The following criteria of treatment failure constitute the only acceptable evidence of 
disease recurrence:  
 Lung:   Positive cytology or biopsy in the presence of a single new lesion or the 
appearance of multiple lesions consistent with metastatic disease  
 Liver:  Positive cytology  or biopsy in the presence of a single new lesion or the 
appearance of multiple lesions consistent with metastatic disease  
 Central nervous system:  A positive brain CT or MRI scan or CSF cytology  
 Cutaneous, subcutaneous , and lymph node recurrence:   Positiv e cytology or biopsy 
in the presence of a single new lesion or the appearance of multiple lesions 
consistent with metastatic disease  
 Bone and other organs:   Positive cytology or biopsy in the presence of a single new 
lesion or the appearance of multiple le sions consistent with metastatic disease 
identified on two different radiologic studies  (i.e., positive nuclear bone scan or PET 
scan and contrast GI series or ultrasound, X -ray or CT of abdomen for abdominal 
disease ) 
 
4.5.7.3 Cohort 2  Tumor and Response Evaluations  
Patients in Cohort 2 will undergo tumor assessments every 9 ( 1) weeks (from Day 1 of 
Cycle 1) for the first 54 weeks  and then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter , regardless of 
dose delays , as outlined in the schedule of activ ities (see Section  A14–8 
[RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort  2]).  The  except ion is  patients who continue 
treatment after radiographic disease progression .  Such patients will undergo tumor 
assessments every 9  weeks unti l loss of clinical benefit as determined by the 
investigator ( see Section  3.1.2  for details ).  Thus, tumor assessments are to continue 
according to schedule in patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than loss 
of clinical benefit, even if they start new, non protocol -specified anti -cancer therapy.  
Tumor assessments that have been performed outside the protocol -mandated time 
window do not have to be repeated.  However,  at the investigator’s discretion, tumor 
assessments may be  repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected.  
Brain metastases treated with radiotherapy or surgery will not be considered measurable 
or eva luable but will be documented at screening as a site of metastatic disease .  Brain 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
67/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 metastases identified at baseline that have been treated with radiotherapy or surgery will 
not be considered measurable or evaluable unless there is suspected disease 
progre ssion in the brain (i.e., the patient becomes symptomatic).  Thus, subsequent 
head scans are not required unless clinically indicated.  
To facilitate evaluation of response per iRECIST  in Cohort 2 , tumor assessments must 
be continued after disease progressi on per RECIST v1.1 for patients who receive 
treatment beyond progression.  This includes continued measurement of target lesions, 
evaluation of non -target lesions (including monitoring for further worsening of any 
non-target lesions that have shown unequivocal progression), and evaluation of any 
newly identified lesions (including measurements, if lesions are measurable;  see 
Appendix  1) at all subsequent assessments.  
Overall response at a single timepoint will be assessed by the investigator using 
RECIST v1.1  (see Appendix  1).  Assessments should be performed by the same 
evaluator, if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits.  Available results must 
be reviewed by the investigator prior to treatment administration.  
Overall res ponse per iRECIST  (see Appendix  2) will not be captured in the eCRF, but 
will instead be calculated programmatically by the Sponsor on the basis of 
investigator -assessed individual lesion data recorded in the eCRF.  
4.5.8 Classification of Surgical Complications  
Surgical complications will be scored according to Clavien -Dindo classification  
(Appendix  5).  Complication rates for every grade will be reported and score d for 
patients that underwent CLND , as outlined for each arm in the schedules of activities 
(see Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg ], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira],  
A14–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort  1], A15–6 [RO7247669 600 mg], and A16–6 
[RO7247669  600 mg   Tira] ). 
4.5.9 Laboratory , Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples  
4.5.9.1 Local Laboratory Assessments  
For information about the timing of local laboratory assessments , please refer to the 
schedule of activities for screening  (Appendix  10) or the appropriate treatment arm 
(Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg ], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 
[RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort  1], A14–8 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort 2], 
A15–6 [RO7247669 600 mg], and A16–6 [RO7247669 600 m g  Tira] ). 
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local laboratory 
for analysis:  
 Hematology:  WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and 
differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and 
other cells)

68/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4  Chemistry panel (serum or plasma):  includes sodium, potassium, magnesium, 
chloride, bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide (if considered standard of care in the 
region), glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, total  protei n, ferritin, albumin, phosphate , 
calcium, total bilirubin, ALP, ALT, AST, amylase, lipase , and LDH .  In addition, 
adrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH) , cortisol, S100, and erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate (ESR)  will be assessed at screening and pre -surgery  visits for patients enrolled 
in Cohort 1 . 
 Lipid panel:  includes triglycerides, HDL, and LDL  
 Coagulation:  INR and  aPTT  
 Thyroid function testing:  TSH, free T3 (or  total T3 for sites where free T3 is not 
performed), and free T4

 HBV serology:  hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody 
(HBsAb), total hepatitis B core antibody ( HBcAb ), and (if HBsAg test is negative and 
total HBcAb  test is positive) HBV DNA  
If a patient has a negative HBsAg test and a positive total HBcAb test at 
screening, an HBV DNA test must also be performed to determine if the patient 
has an HBV infection.  
 HCV serology:  HCV antibody and (if HCV antibody test i s positive) HCV RNA  
If a patient  has a positive HCV antibody test at screening, an HCV RNA test 
must also be performed to determine if the patient has an HCV infection.  
 EBV serology:  
– EBV VCA IgM  
– EBV VCA IgG or Epstein -Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG  
– EBV PCR (only if clinically indicated)  
 Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) serology:  CMV IgM and IgG  
If a patient has a positive CMV IgM test or  4  ULN increase in CMV IgG, 
quantitative PCR should used to determine if the patient has a CMV infection . 
 Pregnancy test  
All w omen of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at 
screening.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests will be performed at specified 
subsequent visits.  If  a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by 
a serum pregnancy test.  Pregnan cy tests will also be performed at treatment 
completion/discontinuation at Week 13 and  during follow -up at 6 month s in 
Cohort 1, and at 3 and 6  months  in Cohort 2 . 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
69/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal , 
has not reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not 
permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, 
and/or uterus) or another cause as determined b y the investigator 
(e.g.,  Müllerian agenesis) . 
 Urinalysis (pH, specific gravity, glucose, protein, ketones, and  blood); dipstick 
permitted  
4.5.9.2 Central Laboratory Assessments  
For information about the timing of central laboratory assessments, please refer to the 
schedule of activities for screening  (Appendix  10) or the appropriate treatment arm 
(Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg ], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 
[RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort  1], A14–8 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Cohort 2], 
A15–6 [RO7247669  600 mg], and A16–6 [RO7247669 600 m g  Tira] ). 
The following samples will be sent to one or several central laboratories or to the 
Sponsor or a designee for analysis:  
 Serum sample for analysis of autoantibodies:  anti nuclear antibody, 
antidouble -stranded DNA, circulating anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and 
perinuclear anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody  
 Serum samples for PK analysis  through use of validated assays  
 Serum samples for immunogenicity analysis through use of validated assays  
 Plasma  and blood for exploratory research on biomarkers including blood -based 
NGS /WES  ctDNA assay  to determine tumor -specific alterations  
 Archival tumor tissue sample for exploratory research on biomarkers  
An archival primary tumor tissue sample, preferably as a FFPE tumor tissue 
block with representation and sufficient tumor content, including the invasive 
margin  (preferred) , or, if available, at least 16 slides containing unstained, 
freshly cut, serial sections, must be submitted along with an associated 
pathology report .  For the Cohort 2 safety  run-in phase , submission of an  
archival sample is preferred, but  patient s are eligible for the study  if no archival 
sample is available .  Remaining archival tumor tissue blocks will be returned to 
the site upon request or 18 months after final closure of the study database, 
whichever occurs first.  
 Fresh  baseline and on-treatment  tumor  tissue for exploratory research on 
biomarkers  
Baseline tumor tissue samples will be collected from all patients (except 
patients in the Cohort 2 safety run -in phas e) by biopsy of  a metastatic lymph 
node (Cohort 1) or other  metastatic lesion (Cohort 2) at screening.  For patients 
in Cohort 1, on -treatment tissue samples will be collected  by biopsy on Day  1 of 
Cycle 2  (up to 72 hours prior to drug administration) , and at surgery ( CLND).  
For patients enrolled in Cohort 2, on -treatment tissue samples will be collected  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
71/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 lavage samples are not acceptable.  Tumor tissue from bone metastases that have been 
decalcified is not acceptable.  
Exploratory biomar ker research may include, but will not be limited to, analysis of genes 
or gene signatures associated with tumor immunobiology, PD -L1, lymphocyte 
subpopulations  and their functional and/or activation status , T-cell receptor repertoire, 
or cytokines associa ted with T -cell activation.  Research may involve extraction of DNA, 
cell-free DNA, or RNA; analysis of mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and 
other genomic variants; and genomic profiling through use of NGS of a comprehensive 
panel of genes.  DNA  extracted from blood may be compared with DNA extracted from 
tissue to identify somatic variants by distinguishing germline variants from somatic 
variants.  NGS methods may include whole genome sequencing (WGS) or WES of 
tissue and blood samples, but WGS or WES of blood samples will be performed only at 
participating sites (see Section  4.5.10 ). 
For sampling procedures, storage conditions,  and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
Unless the patient gives specific consent for his or her leftover samples to be stored for 
optional exploratory research (see Section  4.5.12 ), biologic samples will be destroyed no 
later than the time of completion of the final Clinical Study Report (CSR), with the 
following exceptions:  
 Serum and plasma samples collected for PK anal ysis or immunogenicity analysis 
may be needed for additional immunogenicity characterization and PK and 
immunogenicity assay development and validation; therefore, these samples will be 
destroyed no later than 5 years after the final CSR has been completed . 
 Blood, p lasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cell  (PBMC ), and tumor tissue  
collected for biomarker research will be destroyed no later than 5 years after the final 
CSR has been completed, with the exception of the samples that undergo WES, 
which will be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are exhausted.  
However,  the storage period for the WES samples will be in accordance with the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Ethics Committee ( EC)-approved Informed Consent 
Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements).  
 For enrolled patients, remaining archiva l tissue blocks will be returned to the site 
upon request or no later than the time of final closure of the study database, 
whichever occurs first.  For patients who are not enrolled, remaining archival tissue 
blocks will be returned to the site no later t han 6 weeks after eligibility determination.  
 
When a patient withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to the date of 
withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the patient specifically requests that the 
samples be destroyed or local laws require des truction of the samples.  However, if 
samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will remain as 
part of the overall research data.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
72/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 Data arising from sample analysis will be subject to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section  8.4. 
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of biomarker analyses, data derived from 
these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or patients unless 
required by law.  The  aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in 
accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.  
4.5.10 Blood Samples for Whole Genome Sequencing or Whole 
Exome Sequencing (Patients at Participating Sites)  
At participating sites, blood samples  will be collected for DNA extraction to enable WGS 
or WES to identify variants that are predictive of response to study drug, are associated 
with progression to a more severe disease state, are associated with acquired 
resistance to study drug, are associated with susceptibility to develop adverse events, 
can lead to improved adverse event monitoring or investigation, or can increase the 
knowledge and understandin g of disease biology and drug safety.  DNA extracted from 
blood may be compared with DNA extracted from tissue to identify somatic variants by 
distinguishing germline variants from somatic variants.  The samples may be sent to one 
or more laboratories for analysis.  
Collection and submission of blood samples for WGS or WES is contingent upon the 
review and approval of the exploratory research by each site's IRB/EC and, if applicable, 
an appropriate regulatory body.  If a site has not been granted approval fo r WGS or 
WES, this section of the protocol ( Section  4.5.10 ) will not be applicable at that site.  
Genomics is increasingly informing res earcher's understanding of disease pathobiology.  
WGS and WES provide a comprehensive characterization of the genome and exome, 
respectively, and, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase the 
opportunity for developing new therapeutic  approaches or new methods for monitoring 
efficacy and safety or predicting which patients are more likely to respond to a drug or 
develop adverse events.  Data will be analyzed in the context of this study but may also 
be explored in aggregate with data f rom other studies.  The availability of a larger 
dataset will assist in identification and characterization of important biomarkers and 
pathways to support future drug development.  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see  the 
laboratory manual.  
Blood samples collected for WGS or WES are to be stored until they are no longer 
needed or until they are exhausted.  However, the storage period will be in accordance 
with the IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable la ws (e.g.,  health 
authority requirements).  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
74/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses optional 
biopsies.  A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's 
agree ment to provide optional biopsies.  
The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
participate and (if applicable) the date(s) of consent, by completing the Optional Biopsy 
Sample Informed Consent eCRF.  
Samples may be used for exploratory biomarker research as described in Section  4.5.9 .  
Refer to Secti on 4.5.9  for details on sample storage, use of samples after patient 
withdrawal, confidentiality standards for data, and availability of data derived from 
biomarker analyses . 
4.5.12 Optional Sampl es for Research Biosample Repository  
4.5.12.1 Overview of the Research Biosample Repository  
The Research Biosample Repository (RBR) is a centrally administered group of facilities 
used for the long -term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid 
tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The col lection, 
storage, and analysis of RBR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new 
pharmaceutical agents and the development of biomarker assays , which may allow for 
individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.  
Samples for the RBR will b e collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research.  RBR samples will be used to achieve the following 
objectives:  
 To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy or disease progression  
 To identify safety biom arkers that are associated with susceptibility to developing 
adverse events or can lead to improved adverse event monitoring or investigation  
 To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology and drug safety  
 To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition  
 To develop biomarker assays and establish the performance characteristics of these 
assays  
 
4.5.12.2 Approval by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics 
Committee  
Collection, storage, and analysis of RBR samples is contingent upon the review and 
approval of the exploratory research and the RBR portion of the Informed Consent Form 
by each site's IRB/EC and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body.  If a site has not 
been granted approval for RBR sampl ing, this section of the protocol ( Section  4.5.12 ) 
will not be applicable at that site.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
75/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 4.5.12.3 Sample Collection  
The following samples will be stored in the RBR and used for research purposes, 
including, but not limited to, research on biomarkers related to CIT, diseases, or drug 
safety : 
 Leftover blood, serum, plasma, PBMC, and tumor tissue samples (with the exception 
of leftover tissue from a rchival FFPE blocks, which will be returned to sites) and any 
derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides) collected during the study, 
including leftover tissue samples from additional tumor biopsies or medically 
indicated procedures (e.g., bro nchoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 
colonoscopy) performed at the investigator's discretion  
 
The above samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for analysis of germline or 
somatic variants via WGS, WES , or other genomic analysis methods.  Genomics is 
increasingly informing researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology.  WGS and 
WES provide a comprehensive characterization of the genome and exome, respectively, 
and, along with clinical data collected  in this study, may increase the opportunity for 
developing new therapeutic approaches or new methods for monitoring efficacy and 
safety or predicting which patients are more likely to respond to a drug or develop 
adverse events.  
Data generated from RBR sa mples will be analyzed in the context of this study but may 
also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies.  The availability of a larger 
dataset will assist in identification and characterization of important biomarkers and 
pathways to support  future drug development.  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
RBR specimens are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are 
exhausted.  However, the RBR storage period will be in accordance with the 
IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).  
4.5.12.4 Confidentiality  
RBR samples and associated data will be labeled with a unique patient identification 
number.  
Patient medical informat ion associated with RBR samples is confidential and may be 
disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or  separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the 
patient, unless permitted o r required by law.  
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses of RBR samples, data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
76/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 patients unless required by law.  The aggregate results of any conducte d research will 
be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.  
Data generated from RBR samples must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, and Sponsor m onitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.  
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RBR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property 
of the Sponsor, except wh ere agreed otherwise.  
4.5.12.5 Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository  
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RBR.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR.  Patients will be 
told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any 
time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signa ture will be 
required to document a patient's agreement to provide optional RBR specimens.  
Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.  
The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to 
particip ate and (if applicable) the date(s) of consent, by completing the RBR Research 
Sample Informed Consent eCRF.  
In the event of an RBR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RBR research.  
4.5.12.6 Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository  
Patients who give consent to provide RBR samples have the right to withdraw their 
consent from the RBR at any time for any reason.  After withdrawal of consent, any 
remaining samples will be destr oyed or will no longer be linked to the patient.   However, 
if RBR samples have been tested prior to withdrawal of consent, results from those tests 
will remain as part of the overall research data.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent 
to the testing of  his or her samples, the investigator must inform the Medical Monitor in 
writing of the patient's wishes through use of the appropriate RBR Subject Withdrawal 
Form and, if the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RBR Research 
Sample W ithdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent 
to the testing of his or her RBR samples after closure of the site, the investigator must 
inform the Sponsor by emailing the study number and patient number to the following 
email  address:  
global.rcr -withdrawal@roche.com   
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
77/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 A patient's withdrawal from this study does not, by itself, constitute withdrawal of consent 
for testing of RBR samples .  Likewise, a patient's withdrawal fro m the RBR does not 
constitute withdrawal from this study.  
4.5.12.7 Monitoring and Oversight  
RBR samples will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
managem ent system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as 
adherence to authorized use of samples as specified in this protocol and in the Informed 
Consent Form.  Sponsor monitors and auditors will have direct access to appropriate 
parts of reco rds relating to patient participation in the RBR for the purposes of verifying 
the data provided to the Sponsor.  The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, 
and health authority inspections by providing direct access to source data and 
documen ts related to the RBR samples.  
4.6 TREATMENT, PATIENT, STUDY, AND SITE DISC ONTINUATION  
4.6.1 Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Patients must permanently discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the 
following:  
 Intolerable toxicity related to study treatment, including development of an 
immune -mediated adverse event determined by the investigator to be unacceptable 
given the individual patient’s potential response to therapy and  severity of the event  
 Any medical condition that may jeopardize the pati ent’s safety if he or she continues 
study treatment  
 Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient  
 Use of another non protocol -specified anti -cancer therapy  
 Pregnancy  
 Cohort 1:  Confirmed d isease progression or dissemination prior to surgery .  Patients 
who discontinue study treatment early because of an unacceptable toxicity should 
continue to be followed for both resolution of toxicity and disease recurrence as 
outlined in the schedule of activities ( Sections  A11–6 [Nivo   Ipi], A12–6 
[RO7247669  2100 mg ], A13–6 [Atezo   Tira], A14–6 [RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira 
Cohort  1], A15–6 [RO7247669  600 mg], and A16–6 [RO7247669 600 mg   Tira] ). 
 Cohort 2:  Loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator after an 
integrated assessment of radiographic and biochemical data, local biopsy results 
(if available), and clinical status (e.g., symptomatic deterioration such as pain 
secondary to disease) (see  Section 3.1.2  for details)  
 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
78/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 For Cohort 1, r egardless of whether they complete the study drug treatment period or 
discontinue study drug prematurely, patients who proceed to  surgery  will return to the 
clinic for a treatment completion/discontinuation visit 6 weeks after surgery and patients 
who do not proceed to surgery will return to the clinic for a treatment 
completion/discontinuation visit not more than 30 days after the final do se of study 
treatment.   For patients who progress or have loss of clinical benefit, t he visit at which 
response assessment shows progressive disease or loss of clinical benefit may be used 
as the treatment discontinuation visit.   
For Cohort 2, patients who  discontinue study treatment for any reason other than 
progressive disease or loss of clinical benefit will continue to undergo tumor response 
assessments as outlined in the schedule of activities (see  A14–8). 
Information on long-term follow -up and new anti -cancer  therapy (including targeted 
therapy and immunotherapy)  will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical 
records, and/or clinic visits approximately every 3  months until death (unless the patient 
withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study).  If a patient requests to be 
withdrawn from follow -up, this request must be documented in the source documents 
and signed by the investigator.  If  the patient withdraws from study, the study staff may 
use a public information source (e.g.,  country records) to obtain information about 
survival status only.  For an experimental arm in which all patients discontinued treatment 
and passed the safety follow -up window, as well as approximately 80% of patients 
discontinued the study, the Sponsor may conclude the arm (the remaining ~20% of 
patients will be discontinue d from the study).  
4.6.2 Patient Discontinuation  from Study  
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  
Reasons for wit hdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Patient w ithdrawal of consent  
 Study termination or site closure  
 Patient non -compliance, defined as failure to comply with protocol requirements as 
determined by the investigator or Sponsor  
 
Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the 
study but have not withdrawn consent.  The primary reason for withdrawal from the 
study should be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  Patients who withdraw from the 
study will not be replaced.  
If a patient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source 
(e.g.,  country records) to obtain information about survival status.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
79/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 4.6.3 Study Discontinuation  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate thi s study at any time.  Reasons for terminating 
the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to patients . 
 Patient enrollment is unsatisf actory . 
 
The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study.  
4.6.4 Site Discontinuation  
The Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time.  Reasons for closing a site may 
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 Excessively slow recruitment  
 Poor protocol adherence  
 Inaccurate or incomplete data recording  
 Non-compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for 
Good Clinical Practice  
 No study activity (i.e., all patients have completed the  study and all obligations have 
been fulfilled)  
 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
5.1 SAFETY PLAN  
A safety plan for each treatment arm, including a summary of risks and management 
guidelines for patients who experience specific adverse events, is provided in the 
respectiv e appendix for that treatment arm  in Appendix  11 through  Appendix  16. 
Patients with active infection are excluded from study participation.  In the setting of a 
pandemic or epidemic, screening for active infections (including SARS -CoV-2) prior to 
and during study participation should be considered according to local or institutional 
guidelines or guidelines of applicable professional societies (e.g., American Society of 
Clinical Oncology or European Society for Medical Oncology).  
Severe SARS -CoV-2 infection appears to be associated with a CRS involving the 
inflammatory cytokines IL -6, IL-10, IL -2, and IFN - (Merad and Martin 2020).  If a patient 
develops suspected CRS during the study, a differential diagnosis should include 
SARS -CoV-2 infection , which should be confirmed or refuted through assessment of 
exposure history, appropriate laboratory testing, and clinical or radiologic evaluations per 
investigator judgment.  If a diagnosis of SARS -CoV-2 infection is confirmed, the disease 
should be managed as per local or institutional guidelines.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
80/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AN D DEFINITIONS  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, performing 
protocol -specified s afety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital 
signs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study.  
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as out lined in 
Section  5.4. 
5.2.1 Adverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical  product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:  
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal produ ct, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
 Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Sections 5.3.5.9  and 
5.3.5.10  for more information)  
 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline  
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study treatment  
 Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g.,  screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)  
 
5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is fatal (i.e., the adverse eve nt actually causes or leads to death)  
 Is life threatening (i.e.,  the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)  
This does not include any adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was a llowed to continue, might have caused death.  
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section  5.3.5.11 ) 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results 
in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
81/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study  treatment  
 Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)  
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous.  Seve rity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE; 
see Section  5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events are  required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2  for 
reporting instructions).  
5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hour s after learning of the event; see 
Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for each 
treatment arm are listed in the respective appendix for that treatment arm  
(see Appendix  11 through  Appendix  16). 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FOR CAPTU RING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY  PARAMETERS  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section  5.2.1  for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to  the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.3.5.125.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section  5.2.2  for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3 ), and causa lity (see Section  5.3.4 ). 
5.3.1 Adverse Events  Reporting Period  
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  
All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personn el, will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
82/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported 
(see Section  5.4.2  for instructions for reporting seri ous adverse events).  
After initiation of study treatment , all adverse events will be reported until 30 days after 
the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, 
whichever occurs first, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will continue to be reported until 135 days after the final dose of study treatment 
or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur  after the adverse event reporting 
period  are provided in Section 5.6. 
5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Exa mples of non -directive 
questions include the following:  
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"  
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?"  
 
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity gradi ng scale for the NCI CTCAE v 5.0 will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table  8  will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
83/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 Table 8 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically 
Listed in NCI CTCAE  
Grade  Severity  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
or intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; or limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a 
3 Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or 
limiting  self-care activities of daily living b, c 
4 Life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated d

NCI CTCAE   National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events . 
Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v5.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are 
not bedridden.  
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions), per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section  5.2.2 . 
d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as  serious adverse events (see Section  5.4.2  for 
reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section  5.2.2 . 
  
The ASTCT CRS Consensus Grading Scale (see  Table  9 ) should be used in addition to  
NCI CTCAE when reporting severity of CRS (see Section  5.3.5.1  for details on CRS  
reporting).  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
84/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 Table 9 ASTCT CRS Consensus Grading Scale  
Grade  Symptom(s)  
1  Fever a, with or without constitutional symptoms  
 No hypotension  
 No hypoxia  
2  Fever a combined with at least one of the following:  
 Hypotension not requiring vasopressors  
 Hypoxia requiring low -flow oxygen b by nasal cannula or blow -by 
3  Fever a combined with at least one of the following:  
 Hypotension requiring one vasopressor, with or without vasopressin  
 Hypoxia requiring high -flow oxygen b by nasal cannula, face mask, 
non-rebreather mask, or Venturi mask  
4  Fever a combined with at least one of the following:  
 Hypotension requiring multiple vasopressors (excluding vasopressin)  
 Hypoxia requiring oxygen by positive pressure (e.g., CPAP, BiPAP, 
intubation, and mechanical ventilation)  
5  Death due to CRS for which the cause is not the principal factor leading 
to this outcome  
ASTCT   American Society for Transplantation and Cellular  Therapy; BiPAP   bi-level positive 
airway pressure; CPAP   continuous positive airway pressure; CRS   cytokine -release 
syndrome.  
a Fever is defined as temperature  38C not attributable to any other cause.  In patients who 
develop CRS and then receive an tipyretic, anticytokine, or corticosteroid therapy, fever is no 
longer required when determining CRS severity (grade).  In this case, the CRS grade is 
driven by the presence of hypotension and/or hypoxia.  
b Low flow is defined as oxygen delivered at   6 mL /min, and high flow is defined as  6 L/min. 
  
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to study treatment, indicating "yes" or "no" 
accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also  
Table  10): 
 Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study treatment  
 Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study treatment , or reintroduction of study treatment (as 
applicable)  
 Known association of the event with study treatment or with similar treatments  
 Known association of the event with the disease under study  
 Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
85/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4  Presence of non treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event  
  
Table 10 Causal Attribution Guidance  
Is the adverse event suspect ed to be caused by study treatment on the basis of facts, 
evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?  
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of study treatment, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to study treatment; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon dis continuation of study treatment or dose 
reduction and, if  applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.  
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below . 
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than study treatment 
(e.g.,  preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
or concomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of study treatment (e.g., cancer diagno sed 2 days after 
first dose of study treatment).  
  
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.  
5.3.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse  Events 
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  
5.3.5.1 Infusion -Related Reactions  and Cytokine -Release Syndrome  
There may be significant overlap in signs and symptoms of infusion -related reactions 
(IRRs) and CRS.  While IRRs occur during or within 24 hours after treatment 
administration, time to onset of CRS may vary.  Differential diagnosis should be a pplied, 
particularly for late -onset CRS (occurring more than 24 hours after treatment 
administration), to rule out other etiologies such as delayed hypersensitivity reactions, 
sepsis or infections, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), tumor lysis synd rome, 
early disease progression, or other manifestations of systemic inflammation.  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study treatment 
administration  and are judged to be related to study treatment infusion should be 
captured on the A dverse Event eCRF as a diagnosis (e.g., "infusion -related reaction" 
or "cytokine -release syndrome").  Avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  
Cases of late -onset CRS should be reported as "cytokine -release syndrome" on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
86/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF or Cytokine -Release Syndrome eCRF, as 
appropriate.  
If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to a single administration of 
study treatment, e ach reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event 
eCRF, with associated signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated 
Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF or Cytokine -Release Syndrome eCRF.  
In recognition of the challenges in clinica lly distinguishing between IRRs and CRS, 
consolidated guidelines for medical management of IRRs and CRS are provided in  
Appendix  9, and guidelines for management of IRRs in the RO7247669  arms are 
provided in Appendix  12 and Appendix  15. 
5.3.5.2 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically character ized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be n ullified and replaced by one adverse event 
report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
5.3.5.3 Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events  
In general, advers e events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separate d in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:  
 If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.  
 If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.  
 If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
 If dizziness leads to a fall and consequ ent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
 If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.  
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if i t is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
87/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 5.3.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once o n the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse  Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor imm ediately 
(i.e., no more than 24  hours after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by changing the event from "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fie lds related to serious adverse events.  
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
5.3.5.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
 Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
 Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy  
 Is clinically significant in the invest igator’s judgment  
Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse 
events.  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an  isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g.,  ALP and bilirubin 5   ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis 
(i.e., choles tasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range 
(e.g.,  "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be record ed as the adverse event.  For example, an  elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0  mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
88/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adver se Event eCRF (see Section  5.3.5.4  for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
Not every vital sig n abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
 Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatme nt 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
 Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
 Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g.,  high blood pre ssure), only the diagnosis (i.e.,  hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4  for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.7 Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (  3  baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin (  2  ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury 
(as defined by Hy's Law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:  
 Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  baseline value  in combination with total 
bilirubin  2  ULN (of which  35% is direct bilirubin)  
 Treatment -emergent ALT  or AST  3  baseline value  in combination with clinical 
jaundice  
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see  Section  5.3.5.2 ) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24  hours after learning of 
the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest 
(see Section  5.4.2 ). 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
89/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 5.3.5.8 Deaths 
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the 
protocol -specified adverse event repor ting period (see Section  5.3.1 ) that are attributed 
by the investigator solely to progression of disease should be recorded on the Death 
Attributed to Progressive Disease eCRF.  All other deaths that occur during the adverse 
event reporting period, regardless of relationship to study treatment, must be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor 
(see Section 5.4.2 ). 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the  fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by the established cause of death.  The term "sudden death"  should not be 
used unless combined with the pres umed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section  5.6. 
5.3.5.9 Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the  Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors 
(e.g.,  "more frequent headaches").  
5.3.5.10 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Melanoma  
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease s hould not be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based on RECIST v1.1.  In rare cases, the determination of clinical 
progression will be base d on symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort should 
be made to document progression through use of objective criteria.  If there is any 
uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported 
as an adverse event.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
90/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 5.3.5.11 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization  
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious  adverse event in Section  5.2.2), except as outlined 
below.  
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:  
 Hospitalization for respite care  
 Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (e.g., for study treatment 
administration or performance of an efficacy measurement for the study)  
 Hosp italization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:  
The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected 
normal progres sion of the disease.  
The patient has not experienced an adverse event.  
 Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer  
 
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not 
considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:  
 Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours  
 
5.3.5.12 Cases of Overdose, Medication Error, Drug Abuse, or Drug 
Misuse 
Overdose (accidental or intentional), medication error, drug abuse, and drug misuse 
(hereafter collectively referred to as "special situations"), are defined as follows:  
 Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is  higher 
than the assigned dose  
 Intentional overdose:  intentional administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose  
 Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug  
 In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of the 
drug 
 Drug abuse:  intentional excessive use of a drug that may lead to addiction or 
dependence, physical harm, and/or psychological harm  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
91/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4  Drug misuse:  intentional deviation in the administration of a drug that doe s not 
qualify as drug abuse  
In cases where drug is to be self -administered by the patient, drug misuse 
could involve the drug being administered to someone other than the patient.  
 
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events.  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteria or qualifies as an adverse event of special interest, the event should 
be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e.,  no more than 24  hours after learning of the 
event; see Section  5.4.2 ).  For atez olizumab, tiragolumab,  and RO7247669 , adverse 
events associated with special situations should be recorded as described below for 
each situation:  
 Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" bo xes. 
 Intentional overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Intentional 
overdose" box.  If drug abuse is suspected, check the "Drug abuse" box.  If drug 
abuse is not suspected, check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Medication error" box.  
 Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check 
the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.

Check the "Drug abuse" box.  
 Drug abuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the 
"Intentional overdose" and "Drug abuse" boxes.  
 Drug misuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check 
the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" boxes.  
 
In addition, all special situations associated with  atezolizumab, tiragolumab, and 
RO7247669, regardless of whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF as described below:  
 Accidental overdose:  Enter the drug name and "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check  the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
 Intentional overdose:  Enter the drug name and "intentional overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" box.  If drug abuse is suspected, check the 
"Drug abuse" box.  If drug abuse  is not suspected, check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
92/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4  Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name of the drug 
administered and a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of adminis tration, wrong drug, expired drug 
administered) as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  
 Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "accidental 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Me dication 
error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.

abuse" as the event term.  Check the "Drug abuse" box.  
 Drug abuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "intentional 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug abuse" 
boxes.  
 Drug misuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "drug 
misuse" as the event term.  Check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "intentional 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" 
boxes.  
 Drug administered to someone other than the patient:  Enter the drug name and 
"patient supplied drug to third party" as the event term.  Check the "Drug misuse" 
box. 
 
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require two 
entries on the Adverse Event eCRF, one entry to report the accidental overdose and one 
entry to report the headache.  The "Ac cidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes 
would need to be checked for both entries . 
5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO SPON SOR 
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate 
measures to address  potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list 
of ev ents that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event, regardless of relationship to study treatment:  
 Serious adverse events (defined in Section  5.2.2 ; see Section  5.4.2  for details on 
reporting requirements)  
 Adverse events of special interest (defined in Section  5.2.3 ; see Section  5.4.2  for 
details on reporting requirements)  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
93/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4  Pregnancies (see arm -specific appendices for  details on pregnancy reporting 
requirements for each treatment arm)  
 
For serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, the investigator must 
report new significant follow -up information to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant information 
includes the following:  
 New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis  
 Significant new diagnostic test results  
 Change in causality based on new information  
 Change in the event ’s outcome, including recovery  
 Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event  
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.  
5.4.1 Medical Monitors and Emergency Medical Contacts  
To ensure the safety of study patients, access to the Medical Monitors is available 
24 hours per day, 7  days per week .  Details will be provided separately.  
5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
5.4.2.1 Events That Occur prior to Study Treatment Initiation  
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment, only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  
The pape r Clinical Trial Adverse Event/Special Situations  Form provided to investigators 
should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24  hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and 
emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  
5.4.2.2 Events That Occur after Study Treatment Initiation  
After initiation of study treatment, serious adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will continue to be report ed until 135  days after the final dose of study treatment 
or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  
Investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 
24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse  Event eCRF and submit the report 
via the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  A  report will be generated and sent to 
Roche Safety Risk Management by the EDC system.  
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the paper C linical Trial Adverse 
Event/Special Situations  Form provided to investigators should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24  hours after 
learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emaili ng the form using the 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
94/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 fax number or email address provided to investigators.  Once the EDC system is 
available, all information will need to  be entered and submitted via the EDC system.  
Instructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur after the  reporting period are 
provided in Section  5.6. 
5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PATIENT S AFTER ADVERSE  EVENTS  
5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up 
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline 
grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to 
follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all 
serious adverse events considered to be related to study treatment or trial -related 
procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data 
verification.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.  
5.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up 
For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, th e 
Sponsor or a designee may follow  up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g.,  from 
hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform  
an independent medical assessment of the reported case.  
5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ADVE RSE 
EVENT REPORTING PERI OD 
After the end of the reporting period for serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest (defined as 135 days after t he final dose of study treatment or until 
initiation of new, systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first), all deaths, 
regardless of cause, should be reported through use of the Long -Term Survival  
Follow -Up eCRF . 
After the end of the reporting per iod for non -serious adverse events  (defined as 30 days 
after the final dose of study treatment), all treatment -related non -serious adverse events 
that lead to surgery delay will continue to be reported until 135 days after the final 
dose of study treatment . 
In addition, if the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event that is believed 
to be related to prior exposure to study treatment, the event should be reported through 
use of the Adverse Event eCRF.  However, if the EDC system is not available,  the 
investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
95/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 faxing or by scanning and emailing the paper Clinical Trial Adverse Event/Special 
Situations Form using the fax number or email address provided to investigator s. 
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIE S, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTI TUTIONAL REVIEW BOAR DS, AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES  
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest against cumulative product experience to id entify and expeditiously 
communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislation.  
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess th e expectedness of these events through use of the reference safety 
information in the documents listed below:  
 Opdivo EMA Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC;  nivolumab)  
 Yervoy EMA  SmPC (ipilimumab ) 
 RO7247669 Investigator's Brochure  
 Atezolizumab Inve stigator's Brochure  
 Tiragolumab Investigator's Brochure  
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.  
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.  
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANALYSIS P LAN 
The final study analysis will be based on patient data collec ted through study 
discontinuation.  If not otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will be based on the 
efficacy -evaluable population, defined as all patients who receive at least one dose of 
each drug for their assigned treatment regimen, and safety  analys es will be based on 
the safety -evaluable population, defined as all patients who receive any amount of study 
treatment.  
The analysis results will be summarized by the treatment that patients actually receive.  
Data will be described and summarized as warra nted by sample size.  Continuous 
variables will be summarized through use of means, standard deviations, medians, and 
ranges.  Categorical variables will be summarized through use of counts and 
percentages.  Listings will be used in place of tables in the event of small sample sizes.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
96/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
This study is not designed to make explicit power and type I error considerations for a 
hypothesis test.  Instead, this study is designed to obtain preliminary efficacy, safety, 
and PK data on treatments or treatment combinations when administered to patie nts 
with melanoma.  Cohort 1 will consist of patients with resectable Stage III melanoma 
who have not received prior systemic therapy for their disease .  Cohort 2 will consist of 
patients with Stage IV melanoma who experienced disease progression during or  after 
at least one but not more than two lines of treatment for metastatic disease.  
In Cohort 1, a pproximately  195290 patients will be randomly allocated to the control 
and experimental arms during the study  (3550 patients  to the control  arm and 
2060 patients to each experimental arm ).  In Cohort 2, approximately  846 patients will 
be assigned to an experimental arm .  Please refer to Table  4 for further details . 
6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT  OF STUDY  
Enrollment will be summarized by region, country, and investigator by treatment arm.  
Patient disposition will be summarized by treatm ent arm.  Major protocol deviations, 
including major deviations with regard to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be 
summarized by treatment arm.  
For safety -evaluable patients, study drug administration data will be tabulated or listed 
by treatment  arm, and any dose modifications will be flagged.  Means and standard 
deviations will be used to summarize the total dose and dose intensity for each study 
drug.  Reasons for discontinuation of study drugs will also be tabulated.  
6.3 SUMMARIES OF DEMOGRAPHIC A ND 
BASELINE  CHARACTERISTICS  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, race/ethnicity, weight,  
malignancy duration, metastatic disease site [if applicable ], and baseline ECOG PS) will 
be summarized overall and by treatment arm . 
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  in Cohort 1  
The primary efficacy endpoint  in Cohort 1  is pRR at time of surgery .  pRR will be 
assessed after completion of neoadjuvant treatment  (Week 7) at time of CLND .  
The pRR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve pCR (a complete absence 
of viable tumor in the treated tumor bed ), pathologic near complete response 
(pnCR ;  10% of viable tumor in the treated tumor bed ); and pathologic partial  response 
(pPR;  50% of the treated tumor bed is occupied by viable tumor cells) as determined 
by independent  pathologic review.  Patients with missing or no pathologic response  
assessment , including patients who do not proceed to CLND , will be cla ssified as 
non-responders . 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
97/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 pRR will be calculated for each arm along with 95% CIs (Clopper -Pearson method) .  
The difference in pRR between the experimental arms and the control arm will also be 
calculated , along with 95% CIs using  the Wald method with continuity correction . 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s in Cohort 1  
The secondary efficacy endpoints in Cohort 1 are pRR at time of surgery as determined 
by local pathologic assessment, event -free survival ( EFS), RFS, OS , and ORR prior to 
surgery.  pRR is defined in Section  6.4.1 . 
EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events (whichever 
occurs first):  disease progression that precludes surgery, as assessed by the 
investigator according to RECIST v1.1  (see Section  4.5.7 ); local , regional,  or distant 
disease re currence; or death from any cause.  Patients who have not experienced such 
events will be censored at the time of their last post -tumor tumor assessment.  
RFS is defined as the time from surgery to the first documented recurrence of disease or 
death from an y cause.  For patients who do not have documented recurrence of disease 
or death, RFS will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment.  
OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.  Patients who 
are still alive at the time of OS analysis will be censored at the last date they were known 
to be alive.  
The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the median for RFS, EFS, and OS,  
95% CIs will be constructed using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method.  The RFS, 
EFS, and OS rate at specific timepoints will also be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier 
method, with 95% CIs calculated on the basis of Greenwood’s estimate for the variance.  
The OR R according to RECIST  v1.1 will be assessed after completion of neoadjuvant 
treatment (Week 7) and is defined as the proportion of patients with a CR or PR, as 
determined by the investigator according to RECIST  v1.1.  Patients with missing or no 
response a ssessments will be classified as non -responders.   Note that ORR will be 
determined using  unconfirmed pre -operative radiologic responses.   Although  RECIST 
v1.1 requires confirmatory imaging assessments to be completed at least 4  weeks after 
the initial resp onse, due to the timing of CLND, these responses cannot be confirmed  
with subsequent imaging . 
ORR will be calculated for each arm, along with 95% CIs  (ClopperPearson method) .  
The difference in ORR between the experimental arms and the control arm will al so be 
calculated, along with 95% CIs using the Wald method with continuity correction .   
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
98/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 6.4.3 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints in Cohort 1  
The exploratory efficacy endpoints in Cohort 1 are  landmark EFS, landmark RFS, and 
landmark OS at specific timepoints ( 1, 2, 3, and 5 years ).  RFS, EFS, and OS are 
defined in Section  6.4.2 . 
Landmark EFS rates, landmark RFS rates, and landmark OS rates will be  estimated for 
each study arm using  the Kaplan -Meier method, with 9 5% CIs calculated through use of 
Greenwood’s formula.  
6.4.4 Primary Efficacy Endpoint in Cohort 2  
The primary efficacy endpoint in Cohort 2 is ORR, as defined in Section  2 (see Table  3).  
ORR is determined by the investigator according to RECIST  v1.1.  Patients with missing 
or no response assessments will be classified as  non-responders.  
ORR , the proportion of patients with a complete or partial response,  will be calculated for 
each arm, al ong with 95% CIs (Clopper Pearson method).  
6.4.5 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  in Cohort 2  
The secondary efficacy endpoints in Cohort 2 are PFS, OS, OS at specific timepoints 
(e.g.,  6 months), duration of response (DOR), and disease control, as defined in 
Section  2 (see Table  3).  PFS, DOR, and disease control are determined by the 
investig ator according to RECIST  v1.1.  
DOR will be derived for efficacy -evaluable patients with a CR or PR. 
For patients who do not have documented disease progression or death, PFS and DOR 
will be censored at the day of the last  tumor assessment.  
Patients who are still alive at the time of OS analysis will be censored at the last date 
they were known to be alive.  
The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the median for PFS, OS, and DOR, 
with 95% CIs constructed through use of the Brookmeyer and Crowley method.  OS rate 
at specific timepoints will also be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, with 
95% CIs calculated on the basis of Greenwood’s estimate for the variance.  
Disease control ra te (the proportion of patients with SD for  12 weeks), a PR, or a CR, 
will be calculated for each treatment arm, with 95% CIs estimated through use of 
Clopper -Pearson’s exact method.  
6.4.6 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  in Cohort 2  
The exploratory efficacy endp oints are ORR , PFS, DOR, and disease control  as 
determined by the investigator according to iRECIST  (see Appendix  2). 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
99/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 ORR, PFS, DOR, and disease control will be analyzed through use of  the same methods 
described in Sections  6.4.4  and Section  6.4.5 .  DOR  will be derived for 
efficacy -evaluable patients with a CR or PR.   
6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES  
Verbatim adverse event terms will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities thesaurus te rms, and adverse event severity will be graded according to NCI 
CTCAE v5.0  and also according to the ASTCT CRS Consensus Grading Scale for CRS . 
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory 
test results, changes in vital signs and ECGs, and exposure to study drugs.  Exposure to 
combination treatment and length of safety follow -up will be summarized by treatment 
arm. 
All verbatim adverse event terms will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities thesau rus terms .  Adverse event severity will be graded according to 
NCI CTCAE v5.0, and severity of CRS will also be graded by the investigator according 
to the ASTCT Consensus Grading (Lee et al. 2019).  All adverse events, serious 
adverse events, adverse even ts leading to death, adverse events of special interest, and 
adverse events leading to study treatment discontinuation that occur on or after the first 
dose of study treatment (i.e., treatment -emergent adverse events) will be summarized by 
mapped term, app ropriate thesaurus level, and severity grade.  For events of varying 
severity, the highest grade will be used in the summaries.  Deaths and causes of death 
will be summarized.  
Relevant laboratory, vital sign (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, p ulse 
oximetry, and  temperature), and ECG data will be displayed by time, with grades  
identified where appropriate.  Additionally, a shift table of selected laboratory test results 
will be used to summarize the baseline and maximum postbaseline severity gra de.  
Changes in vital signs and ECGs will be summarized.  
Additionally, i n Cohort 1, the incidence, nature of immune -related adverse events 
Grade   3 during the first 12 weeks, and the rate and duration of delayed surgery due to 
treatment -related adverse ev ents will be summarized by treatment arm .  CLND may be 
delayed for up to 2 weeks if study treatment -related adverse events  have not improved 
sufficiently at the time of planned surgery (see  Section  3.1.3 ). 
Additionally, surgical complications will be scored according to Clavien -Dindo 
classification  (Appendix  5).  Complication rates for every grade will be reported and 
scored for patients that underwent CLND.  
6.6 PHARMACOKINETIC ANAL YSES 
Sparse samples will be collected for PK analyses of atezolizumab (patients who receive 
at least one dose of atezolizumab) and specified drugs given either alone or in 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
100/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 combination with atezolizumab (patients who receive at least one dose of the drug).  
Seru m or plasma concentrations of the various study drugs will be reported as individual 
values and summarized (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, 
range, geometric mean, and geometric mean coefficient of variation) by treatment arm 
and by cycle and day when appropriate and as data allow.  Individual and median serum 
or plasma concentrations of the various study drugs will be plotted by treatment arm and 
cycle and day.  PK data for combination drugs may be compared with available histori cal 
data from internal and published previous studies.  Atezolizumab or other study drug 
concentration data may be pooled with data from other studies using an established 
population PK model to derive PK parameters such as clearance, volume of distributio n, 
and area under the curve.  
The relationship between PK parameters and safety, efficacy, PK, and biomarker 
endpoints may be analyzed and reported via descriptive statistics.  
6.7 IMMUNOGENICITY ANALY SES 
Immunogenicity may be assessed for atezolizumab and other  study treatments as 
appropriate (refer to arm -specific appendices for details).  The immunogenicity analyses 
will include all patients with at least one anti -drug antibody (ADA) assessment.  Patients 
will be grouped according to treatment received or, if no treatment is received prior to 
study discontinuation, according to treatment assigned.  
For atezolizumab, the numbers and proportions of ADA -positive patients and 
ADA-negative patients at baseline (baseline prevalence) and after drug administration 
(postbaseline incidence) will be summarized by treatment group.  When determining 
postbaseline incidence, patients are considered to be ADA positive if they are ADA 
negative or have missing data at baseline but develop an ADA response following study 
drug exposure (treatment -induced ADA response), or if they are ADA positive at 
baseline and the titer of one or more postbaseline samples is at least 0.60 -titer unit 
greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment -enhanced ADA response).  
Patients are considered to be ADA negative if they are ADA negative or have missing 
data at baseline and all postbaseline samples are negative, or if they are ADA positive at 
baseline but do not have any postbaseline samples with a titer that is at least 0.60 -titer 
unit greater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment unaffected).  
For other study treatments where ADA is tested, positivity will be determined according 
to standard methods established in previous studies of that drug.  
The relationship between ADA s tatus and safety, efficacy, PK, and biomarker endpoints 
may be analyzed and reported via descriptive statistics.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
101/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 6.8 BIOMARKER ANALYSES  
Exploratory biomarker analyses will be performed in an effort to understand the 
association of these biomarkers with respons e to study drugs, taking into account 
efficacy and safety endpoints (see Section  4.5.9  for more details).  
6.9 INTERIM ANALYSES  
Given the exploratory nature of this study, it is anticipated that interim analyses will be 
conducted during the study, with the earliest interim analysis t aking place when at least 
one experimental arm has completed enrollment in the preliminary phase, and patients 
have completed their pathologic response assessment (Cohort 1 ), or when at least one 
experimental arm has completed enrollment in the preliminary  phase and patients have 
been followed for a minimum of 9 weeks for the primary en dpoint analysis (ORR) 
(Cohort 2) .  Further interim analyses may be conducted as deemed appropriate by 
Sponsor.  In Cohort 1, a  posterior probability may be used to guide furt her enrollment 
based on the interim analysis of clinical activity in the experimental arm compared with 
the control arm.  If the interim analysis suggests that the activity in an experimental arm 
is higher than that in the control arm, for example, the pos terior probability of having a 
pRR improvement (e.g. , 10%) is greater than a threshold (e.g. , 70% confidence level), 
there may be further enrollment of 20  additional patients in the experimental arm 
(expansion phase) . 
In Cohort 2, a posterior probability m ay be used to guide further enrollment in a 
treatment arm based on an interim analysis of clinical activity in the experimental arm 
compared with a predefined ORR threshold , defined as an improvement over standard 
of care.  For example, if available data suggest a  standard of care ORR of 10% , and an 
ORR improvement of 10% is considered to be a  clinical meaningful  change , this would 
lead to an ORR threshold of 20% in the calcu lation of the posterior probability.  
The ORR for standard of care treatment will be based on emerging internal and external 
data for in-class immune -modulating investigational and other compounds for the patient  
population in Cohort 2  who have received at least two lines of prior treatment  at the time 
of the analysis.  
The Sponsor may make a decision to expand enrollment in an arm based on the totality 
of available data including, but not limited to, duration of the observed responses, PFS, 
and potentially e arly OS data.  Safety and biomarker data (available at the time of 
making this decision) will also be taken into consideration from the perspective of an 
adequate benefit -risk assessment.  
The interim analyses will be performed and interpreted by Sponsor st udy team 
personnel.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
102/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 7. DATA COLLECTION AND M ANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURAN CE 
The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality 
checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of 
eCRFs.  Sit es will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of 
discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites 
will resolve electronically in the EDC system.  
The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Sp ecification document that describes the 
quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central laboratory data will be sent 
directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle and process 
the electronic transfer of these data.  
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data 
will be consistent with  the Sponsor’s standard procedures.  
7.2 ELECTRONIC CASE REPO RT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  Sites 
will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  
eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in 
accordance with instructions from the Sponsor.  
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.  
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive pat ient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.  
Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required.  
7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENT ATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verificati on and review to confirm that 
critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site 
personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source  documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient dat a are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data  from automated 
instruments, copies  of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate 
and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories , and medico -technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
103/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.  
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section  7.5. 
To facilitate source data verification and review, the inv estigators and institutions must 
provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for 
trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also 
allow inspection by applicable health authorities.  
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYST EMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been valid ated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems  used in clinical research.  
An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original 
entry of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit 
trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the 
person making the change, and date of the change.  
7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this stud y and the distribution of 
IMPs, including  eCRFs, Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication 
inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15  years 
after completion or discontinuation of the study or for  the length of time required by 
relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer.  After that period of 
time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.  
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or moving them to another location.  
Roche will retain study data for 25 years after the final study results have been reported 
or for the le ngth of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, 
whichever is longer.

national laws . 
8.2 INFORMED CONSENT  
The Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample Informed Consent 
Forms such as an Assent Form or Mobile Nursing Informed Consent Form, if  applicable) 
will be provided to each site.  If applicable, it will be provided in a cer tified translation of 
the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed 
deviations from the Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Forms or any alternate consent 
forms proposed by the site (collectively, the "Consent Forms") before IRB/EC 
submission.  The final IRB/EC approved Consent Forms must be provided to the 
Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements.  
If applicable, the Informed Consent Form will contain separate sections for any opt ional 
procedures.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential risks associated with each optional procedure.  
Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdra w their 
consent at any time for any reason.  A separate, specific signature will be required to 
document a patient's agreement to participate in optional procedures.  Patients who 
decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.  
The Consent Fo rms must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient’s legally 
authorized representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history or 
clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that 
written  informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  
The Consent Forms should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures 
or when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient 
to participate.  The final revised IRB/EC -approved Consent Forms must be provided to 
the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes.  
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
105/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 If the Consent Forms are revised (through an amendment or an addendum) to 
communicate information that might affect a patient's willi ngness to continue in the 
study, the patient or a legally authorized representative must re -consent by signing the 
most current version of the Consent Forms or the addendum, in accordance with 
applicable laws and IRB/EC policy.  For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the 
case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent 
process and that written informed consent was obtained using the updated/revised 
Consent Forms for continued participation in the study.  
A copy of each  signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the patient’s 
legally authorized representative.  All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in 
each patient’s study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study 
monito rs at any time.  
For sites in the United States, each Consent Form may also include patient authorization 
to allow use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1 996.  If the site utilizes a 
separate Authorization Form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal 
health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and  other 
processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be 
required per study site policies.  
8.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW  BOARD OR ETHICS  COMMITTEE  
This protocol, the Informed Consent Forms, any information to be given to the patient, 
and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the Principal

data against accidental or unlawful loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access.  
In the event of a data security breach, appropriat e mitigation measures will be 
implemented.  
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the 
study through assignment of a unique patient identification number.  This means that 
patient names are not included in data se ts that are transmitted to any Sponsor location.  
Patient medical information obtained by this study is confidential and may be disclosed 
to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or  separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of pe rsonal health information) signed by the 
patient, unless permitted or required by law.  
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare, for treatment purposes.  
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by law.  The aggregate results of any conducted research will 
be available in accordance with the effective Roche policy on study data publication 
(see Section  9.5). 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, and  the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate.  
Study data may be submitted to government o r other health research databases or 
shared with researchers, government agencies, companies, or other groups that are not

clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application 
has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to submit a journal 
manuscript reporting primary clinical trial results within 6 months after the availability of 
the respective Clinical Study Report.  In addition, for all clinical trials in patients involving 
an IMP for which a marketing authorization application has been f iled or approved in any 
country, the Sponsor  aims to publish results from analyses of additional endpoints and 
exploratory data that are clinically meaningful and statistically sound.  
The investigator must agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to th e Sponsor prior 
to submission for publication or presentation.  This allows the Sponsor to protect 
proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other 
studies that may not yet be available to the investigator.  
In accordance with  standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center 
data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.  
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  Any formal publication 
of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional 
monitor ing will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the 
appropriate Sponsor personnel.

Appendix 1:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
116/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 Selected sections from the Response Evalu ation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 
(RECIST v1.1) ( Eisenhauer et al. 2009 ) are presented below, with slight modifications 
from the original publication, and the addition of explanatory text as needed for clarity.  
For Cohort 1, responses will be ass essed and determined according to RECIST v1.1, 
but are not required to be confirmed by later imaging studies.  
A1–1 TUMOR MEASURABILITY  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or 
non-measurable as described below.  All measurable  and non -measurable lesions 
should be assessed at screening and at subsequent protocol -specified tumor 
assessment timepoints.  Additional assessments may be performed as clinically 
indicated for suspicion of progression.  
A1–1.1 DEFINITION OF MEASUR ABLE LESIONS  
A1–1.1.1 Tumor Lesions  
Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows:  
 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
(CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval  5 mm)  
 10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)  
 20 mm by chest X -ray 
 
A1–1.1.2 Malignant Lymph Nodes  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 
 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT  scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be  5 mm).  At  baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be 
measured and follow ed.  Additional information on lymph node measurement is provided 
below (see "Identification of Target and Non -Target Lesions" and "Calculation of Sum of 
Diameters").  
Appendix 1:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
117/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 A1–1.2 DEFINITION OF NON -MEASURABLE LESIONS  
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions  (longest diameter  10 mm or 
pathologic  lymph nodes with short axis  10 mm but  15 mm) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdomi nal 
mass/abdominal organomegaly  identified by physical examination that is not measurable 
by reproducible imaging techniques.  
A1–1.3 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIO NS REGARDI NG LESION 
MEASURABILITY  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment, as outlined below.  
Bone Lesions:  
 Technetium -99m bone scans, sodium fluoride positron emission tomography (PET) 
scans, and pl ain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques for 
measuring bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft t issue 
components that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as 
CT or MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component 
meets the definition of measurability described above.  
 Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
 
Cystic Lesions:  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) because 
they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesions thought to represent  cystic metastases can be considered 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  
However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
 
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to 
other loco -regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  
 
Appendix 1:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
118/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 A1–2 METHODS FOR ASSESSIN G LESION S 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study.  
Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option.  
A1–2.1 CLINICAL LESIONS  
Clinical lesions wil l only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 
 10 mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  For the case of 
skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size 
of the lesion, is s uggested.  
A1–2.2 CHEST X -RAY 
Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an important 
endpoint, because CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measu rable if they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
A1–2.3 CT AND MRI SCANS  
CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment.  In this guideline, the definition of measurability of lesion s on 
CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is  5 mm.  When CT scans 
have slice thickness of  5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable.  
If prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with IV 
contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a 
noncontrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at 
baseline and during the study should be guided by the tumor type under investigation 
and the anatomic location of the disease.  For patients who develop contraindications to 
contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non -contrast CT 
or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the 
tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease, and should be optimized to allow 
for comparison with prior studies, if possible.  Each case should be discussed with the  
radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, 
the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward .  Care must be 
taken in measurement of target lesions and interpretation of non -target disea se or new 
Appendix 1:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
119/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 lesions on a different modality, because the same lesion may appear to have a different 
size using a new modality.  
A1–2.4 ENDOSCOPY, LAPAROSCO PY, ULTRASOUND, TUMO R 
MARKERS, CYTOLOGY, H ISTOLOGY  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, tumor markers, cytology,  and histology cannot be 
utilized for objective tumor evaluation.  
A1–3 ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR BURDEN  
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent 
measurements.  
A1–3.1 IDENTIFICATION OF TA RGET AND NON -TARGET LESIONS  
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should  be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline.  This means that, for instances in which patients have only one or 
two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two 
sites), respectively, wil l be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs 
will be considered non -target lesions.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and be representative of all involved organs, but in a ddition should lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibl y should be 
selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention because they are normal anatomical structures that 
may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumo r.  As noted above, pathologic  
nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as ta rget lesions must meet 
the criterion of a short axis of  15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes 
will contribute to the baseline sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally 
used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by  solid tumor.  Lymph node size is 
normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT, 
this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition may be axial, 
sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these m easures is the short axis.  For example, an 
abdominal node that is reported as being 20  mm   30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20  mm should be recorded 
as the node meas urement.  All other pathologic  nodes (those with short axis  10 mm 
Appendix 1:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
120/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 but  15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis of 
 10 mm are considered non -pathologic  and should not be recorded or followed.  
All lesions (or sites of disease) not selec ted as target lesions (measurable or 
nonmeasurable), including pathologic lymph nodes, should be identified as non -target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required.  It is 
possible to record multiple non -target lesions  involving the same organ as a single item 
on the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., "multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes" or 
"multiple liver metastases").  
A1–3.2 CALCULATION OF SUM O F DIAMETERS  
A sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non -lymph node lesions, sho rt axis for 
lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions at baseline and at each 
subsequent tumor assessment as a measure of tumor burden.  
A1–3.2.1 Measuring Lymph Nodes  
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short a xis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline 
examination), even if the node regresses to  10 mm during the study.  Thus, when 
lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of diameters may not be zero even 
if compl ete response criteria are met, because a normal lymph node is defined as having 
a short axis of  10 mm. 
A1–3.2.2 Measuring Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure  
During the study, all target lesions (lymph node and non -lymph node) recorded at 
baseline should hav e their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph 
nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that 
the radiologist may not feel c omfortable assigning an exact measurement and may 
report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value 
be recorded on the CRF, as follows:  
 If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared,  the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  
 If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned and "too small  to measure" should be 
ticked .  (Note:  It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes because 
they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by 
fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a  default value of 5 mm should 
be assigned in this circumstance as well, and "too small to  measure" should also be 
ticked .) 
Appendix 1:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
121/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measurement, that 
should be recorded, even if it is  5 mm, an d in that case "too small to measure" should 
not be ticked.  
A1–3.2.3 Measuring Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment  
When non -lymph node lesions fragment, the longest diameters of the fragmented 
portions should be added together to calculate the sum of diamet ers.  Similarly, as 
lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the  longest diameter in 
this instance should be the maximum longest diameter for the coalesced lesion.  
A1–3.3 EVALUATION OF NON -TARGET LESIONS  
Measurements are not required for non -target lesions, except that malignant lymph node 
non-target lesions should be monitor ed for reduction to  10 mm in short axis.  
Non-target lesions should be noted at baseline and should be identified as "present" or 
"absent" and (in rare cases) may be noted as "indicative of progression" at subsequent 
evaluations.  In addition, if a lymph  node lesion shrinks to a non -malignant size (short 
axis  10 mm), this should be captured on the CRF as part of the assessment of 
non-target lesions.  
A1–4 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
A1–4.1 CRITERIA FOR TARGET LESIONS  
Definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for target lesions 
are provided below:  
 Complete response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
Any pathologic  lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to  10 mm.  
 Partial response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diamet ers of all target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR  
 Progressive disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (inc luding 
baseline)  
In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of  5 mm.  
 Stable disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
122/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 A1–4.2 CRITERIA FOR NON -TARGET LESIONS  
Definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the group of 
nontarget lesions are provided below.  While some non -target lesions may actually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and instead should b e assessed only 
qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the schedules of activities.  
 CR:  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of 
tumor marker level  
All lymp h nodes must be non -pathologic  in size ( 10 mm short axis).  
 Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesions and/or 
(if applicable) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 PD:  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  
 
A1–4.3 SPECIAL NOTES ON ASS ESSMENT OF PROGRESSI ON OF 
NON-TARGET LESIONS  
A1–4.3.1 Patients with Measurable and Non -Measurable Disease  
For patients with both measurable and non -measurable disease to achieve unequivocal 
progression on the basis of the non -target lesions, there must be an overall level of 
substantial wo rsening in non -target lesions in a magnitude that, even in the presence of 
SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non -target 
lesions  is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The 
designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non -target lesions in 
the face of SD or PR in target lesions will therefore be extremely rare.  
A1–4.4 NEW LESIONS  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for 
the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, 
change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor 
(for example, some "new" bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisti ng 
lesions).  This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show PR or 
CR.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a 
"new" cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  
Appendix 1:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
123/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it rep resents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan.  
A1–4.5 CRITERIA FOR OVERALL  RESPONSE AT A SINGL E 
TIMEPOINT  
Table  A1-1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each 
response assessment timepoint for patients who have measurable disease at baseline.  
Table A1-1 Criteria for Overall Response at a Single Timepoint:  Patients 
with Target Lesions (with or without Non -Target Lesions)

CR Not all evaluated  No PR 
PR Non-PD or not all evaluated  No PR 
SD Non-PD or not all evaluated  No SD

Any PD Yes or no  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
CR   complete  response; NE   not evaluable; PD   progressive disease; PR   partial response; 
SD   stable disease.  
 
A1–4.6 MISSING ASSESSMENTS AND NOT -EVALUABLE 
DESIGNATION  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If measurements are made on only a subset of target 
lesions at a timepoint, usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that 
timepoint, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the 
individual missing lesio ns would not change the assigned timepoint response.  This 
would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.  For example, if a patient had a 
baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured lesions and during the study only two 
lesions were assessed, but those g ave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved 
PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion.  
A1–4.7 SPECIAL NOTES ON RES PONSE ASSESSMENT  
Patients with a global deterioration in health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without ob jective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
Appendix 1:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
124/Protocol BO43328 , Version 4 having "symptomatic deterioration."  Every effort should be made to document objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descr iptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The 
objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target 
and non -target lesions as shown in  Table  A1-1. 
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.

126/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Conventional response criteria may not be adequate to characterize the anti -tumor 
activity of immunotherapeutic agents, which can produce delayed responses that may 
be preceded by initial apparent radiographic progression, including the appearance of 
new l esions.  Therefore, immunotherapy -specific response criteria adaptations to 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1; Eisenhauer 
et al. 2009) have been developed to allow for unconventional response and progression 
patterns.  This includes modified  RECIST  v1.1 for immune -based therapeutics 
(iRECIST), which are described below.  
A2–1 MODIFIED RECIST  V1.1 FOR IMMUNE -BASED THERAPEUTICS 
(IRECIST)  
iRECIST (Seymour et al. 2017) was developed by the RECIST working group in an effort 
to crea te a common set of criteria that the CIT field could apply to clinical 
trials.   Response evaluation through use of iRECIST requires collection of tumor 
assessment data after radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1.  Details regarding 
lesion evaluation are  described below.   When not otherwise specified, RECIST v1.1 
conventions will apply.  
Criteria for determining overall response at a single timepoint per iRECIST are also 
summarized below.   Of note, overall response per iRECIST will not be captured in the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF), but will instead be calculated programmatically by 
the Sponsor on the basis of investigator -assessed individual lesion data recorded in the 
eCRF.  
iRECIST response status is not a specific component of treatment discontinu ation 
criteria, including decisions about whether to continue treatment beyond progression per 
RECIST v1.1.   Investigators should instead take into account radiologic data and clinical 
status in making such de cisions, as described in Section  3.1.1 . 
A2–1.1 EVALUATION OF LESION S TO SUPPORT IRECIST  RESPONSE 
ASSESSMENT AFTER DIS EASE PROGRESSION PER  
RECIST V1.1 
iRECIST is an extension of RECIST v1.1 that allows for response assessment following 
disease progression per RECIST v1.1.   RECIST v1.1 rules for categorizing lesions as 
measurable or non -measurable and  measuring lesions  (see Appendix  1) also apply to 
iRECIST.   After disease progression per RECIST  v1.1, the same target and non -target 
lesions selected at baseline will continue to be followed, along with any new lesions that 
develop, to support iRE CIST response evaluations, as described below and summarized 
in Table  A2-1.  Once a lesion has been categorized as a target, non -target, or new 
lesion, it will remain classified as such.  
Appendix 2:  Modified RECIST v1.1 for Immune -Based Therapeutics (iRECIST)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
127/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A2–1.1.1 Target Lesions  
The target lesions selected at baseline should continue to be measured at all tumor 
assessment timepoints after disease progression per RECIST v1.1, according to 
RECIST v1.1 conventions.  
A2–1.1.2 Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions selected at baseline should continue to be followed at all tumor 
assessment timepoints after disease progression per RECIST v1.1.   At each timepoint, 
non-target lesions should continue to be categorized as "absent" (co mplete response 
[CR]), "unequivocal progression" relative to baseline (progressive disease [PD]), or 
"present without unequivocal progression" (non -CR/non -PD), as defined by 
RECIST  v1.1.   In addition, any non -target lesions that were categorized as PD at t he 
previous timepoint should be evaluated to determine whether there has been any further 
increase in size.  
A2–1.1.3 New Lesions  
New lesions identified after baseline will be evaluated for measurability with use of the 
same criteria applied to prospective target le sions at baseline per RECIST v1.1 
(e.g.,  non-lymph node lesions must be   10 mm on the longest diameter; new lymph 
nodes must be   15 mm on the short axis [see note below]).   All new lesions 
(measurable or non -measurable) must be assessed and recorded at t he time of 
identification and at all subsequent tumor assessment timepoints.  
Up to a maximum of five measurable new lesions total (with a maximum of two lesions 
per organ) should be selected and measured at each timepoint.   New lesions that are 
not measura ble at first appearance but meet measurability criteria at a subsequent 
timepoint should be measured from that point on, if the maximum number of measurable 
new lesions has not been reached.  However, for calculation of the sum of diameters for 
new lesions , iRECIST excludes measurements from new lesions that were not 
measurable at first appearance.  
All non -measurable new lesions (including those that subsequently become measurable) 
and additional measurable new lesions (in excess of five total or two per or gan) should 
be assessed to determine whether there is any increase in size relative to the previous 
assessment timepoint.  
Note regarding new lymph node lesions:   If at first appearance the short axis of a lymph 
node lesion is   15 mm, it will be cons idered a measurable new lesion.  If at first 
appearance the short axis of a lymph node lesion is   10 mm and   15 mm, the lymph 
node will not be considered measurable but will still be considered a new lesion and 
should be identified as a non -measurable ne w lesion.   If at first appearance the short

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
128/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  axis of a lymph node is   10 mm, the lymph node should  not be considered pathologic 
and should not be considered a new lesion.   A lymph node can subsequently become 
measurable, when the short axi s is  15 mm.   Measurable new lymph node lesions 
should continue to be measured at all subsequent timepoints, even if the short axis 
decreases to   15 mm (or even   10 mm).

conventions.  
Non-target lesions  Non-target lesions should continue to be categorized as absent (CR),

any non -target lesions that were categorized as PD at the previous 
timepoint should be evaluated to determine whether there has been any 
further increase in size.  
New lesions  New lesions should be evaluated for measurability per  RECIST  v1.1.  
All new lesions (measurable or non -measurable) must be assessed and 
recorded at the time of identification and at all subsequent tumor 
assessment timepoints.

of two lesions per organ) should be selected and measured at each 
timepoint.  
All non -measurable new lesions (including those that subsequently 
become measurable) and additional measurable new lesions (in excess 
of five total or two per organ) should be assessed to determ ine whether 
there is any increase in size relative to the previous assessment 
timepoint.

Criteria for Adequate Surgical Procedures for  
Therapeutic Lymph Node Dissection  
Complete lymph node dissection (CLND)  after neoadjuvant melanoma treatment should 
be performed as planned if the patient is receiving corticosteroids or other 
anti-inflammatory drugs for the management of immune -mediated adverse events, 
provided these are being given at a stable or tapering dose and the severity of adverse 
events is Grade 2 or better.  CLND may be de layed for up to 2 weeks if study 
treatment -related adverse events have not improved sufficiently at the time of planned 
surgery (see  Section  3.1.3 ). 
Criteria for adequate surgical procedures for therapeutic lymph node dissection:  
Head and Neck  
 Minimum of 15 pathologically investigated nodes  
 Face, ear, and anterior scalp:  parotidec tomy plus (modified) radical neck dissection  
 Posterior scalp:  (modified or posterior) radical neck dissection plus suboccipital 
nodes.  For this specific localization, a CLND will be considered as adequate if at 
least 5 lymph nodes (LN) have been investig ated 
 
Upper Extremity  
 Minimum of 10 pathologically investigated nodes  
 Axillary node dissection included at least 10 nodes taken from Levels I and II  
 It is advised to routinely include the Level III nodes too  
 Level III nodes should always be dissected if th ey were clinically involved  
 
Lower Extremity  
 Minimum of 5 pathologically investigative nodes  
 If Cloquet’s node is positive, a deep groin (external iliac and obturator) node 
dissection should be performed  
 
(Modified ) Radical Neck Dissection:  
Classic or modified radical neck dissection may be performed for patients with 
melanoma of the head and neck.  Minimum of 15 nodes must be pathologically  
investigated.  As noted above, patients with melanoma located on the ear and anterior 
scalp and face w ill require superficial parotidectomy along with a (modified) radical neck 
procedure.  The boundaries of the radical neck dissection are inferiorly the clavicle; the 
mandible, the mastoid and the tail of the parotid gland superiorly; the anterior border of  
the trapezius muscle posteriorly and the strap muscle of the larynx anteriorly.  The 
sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein,  and/or spinal accessory nerve may be 
sacrificed or preserved at the surgeon's discretion.  For posterior lesions the ra dical neck 
incision must be extended posteriorly or a second incision must be made so that the 
Appendix 4:  Criteria for Adequate Surgical P rocedures for Th erapeutic Lymph Node 
Dissection  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
133/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  sub-occipital/postauricular nodal group can be sampled.  For posterior neck dissection, 
surgical and pathologic exploration of 5 nodes are sufficient to consider  the procedure is 
adequate.  
Axillary Lymphadenectomy:  
For this study a complete axillary lymph node dissection will be performed including 
nodes at Levels I, II, and III (Level III does not have to be removed routinely, but is 
advised.  In any case Level III should be dissected in case of preoperative nodal 
involvement).  Axillary node dissection must include at least 10 nodes taken from Levels 
I and II and the Level III nodes dissected for palpable axillary nodes.  Minimum of 10 
nodes must be pathological ly investigated.  The boundaries of the dissection should 
include the axillary vein superiorly beginning at the thoracic outlet and coursing to the 
latissimus dorsi tendon.  The lateral border of the dissection is the anterior edge of the 
lattisimus dorsi muscle.  The posterior boundary is the subscapular muscle.  The anterior 
border of the resection is the pectoralis major group.  The inferior boundary of the 
dissection should be the juncture of the latissimus dorsi and the serratus anterior 
muscles.  
The c ontents within these boundaries should be completely removed with the exception 
of the long thoracic nerve and the thoracodorsal nerve which should be identified during 
the dissection and preserved throughout.  As stated, the pectoralis minor muscle may be  
divided or sacrificed with the specimen at the discretion of the surgeon.  The preferable 
approach to the axilla is through a horizontal incision in the line of the skin crease, 3 or 
4 cm below the apex of the skin fold of the axilla.  
Inguinal Lymphadenec tomy (Superficial Groin Dissection):  
A superficial groin (femoral/inguinal) node dissection should be performed by excising all 
of the nodes inferior to the inguinal ligament and bounded by the medial border of the 
sartorius muscle in the lateral border of  the adductor magnus muscle.  The fatty and 
lymphatic tissues should be dissected carefully off of the femoral vessels and nerves all 
the way up to the inguinal canal and for 2 3 cm superior to the inguinal ligament (the 
superficial subcutaneous tissue cra nial to the exit of the femoral canal).  The saphenous 
vein is resected to ensure complete excision of the lymph nodes.   Transposition of the 
sartorius muscle should be considered (but is not mandatory) to cover the femoral 
vessels after complete lymphatic  excision.  Ideally, this area should be entered through a 
curvilinear incision staring laterally over the inguinal ligament and curving medially and 
inferiorly ending over the mid -point of the adductor magnus muscle.  For a superficial 
groin node dissecti on, a minimum of 5 nodes must be pathologically investigated.

Dissection  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
134/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Deep Groin (External Iliac and Obturator) Node Dissection:  
Deep Inguinal and External Iliac Node Dissection can be most easily approached by 
incising the abdominal wall musculature 3 or 4 cm sup erior to the inguinal ligament.  
This incision is taken down through the external oblique, internal oblique and 
transversus muscles and the surgeon at that point stays extraperitoneal as in the 
approach to the iliac vessels for renal transplantation.  With  this approach, the external, 
internal,  and common iliac arteries are exposed and the lymphatics coursing among the 
iliac vessels are excised.  The obturator nodes along the obturator nerve and artery 
should also be resected through this approach.  A full combined superficial and deep 
groin (ilio -inguinal) node dissection is advised in case of when Cloquet’s node is positive 
or if there is other evidence of extended involvement to the deep nodes preoperatively.

Preexisting Autoimmune Diseases and Immune Deficiencies  
Patients should be carefully questioned regarding their history of acquired or congenital 
immune deficiencies or autoimmune disease.  Patients with any history of immune 
deficiencies or autoimmune disease listed in the table below are excluded from 
partici pating in the study.  Possible exceptions to this exclusion could be patients with a 
medical history of such entities as atopic disease or childhood arthralgia s where the 
clinical suspicion of autoimmune disease is low.  Patients with a history of autoimmu ne-
related hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement hormone may be eligible 
for this study.  In addition, transient autoimmune manifestations of an acute infectious 
disease that resolved upon treatment of the infectious agent are not excluded  
(e.g.,  acute Lyme arthritis).   Caution should be used when considering atezolizumab , 
tiragolumab , or RO7247 669 for patients who have previously experienced a severe or 
lifethreatening skin adverse reaction or pericardial disorder while receiving another 
immunostimulatory anti -cancer agent.   The Medical Monitor  is available to advise on  any 
uncertainty over autoimmune exclusions.

Appendix 9 :   Guidelines for Management of Atezolizumab -, Tiragolumab -, and/or 
RO7247669 -Specific Adverse Events  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
140/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  These guidelines are intended to inform rather than supersede an investigator's clinical 
judgment and assessment of the benefit risk balance when managing individual cases.  
Tiragolumab and RO7247669 are in an early phase of clinical development , and not a ll 
risks are known  as clinical evaluation is ongoing .  Please refer to Section 6 of the 
Tiragolumab or RO7247669 Investigator's Brochure for a detailed description of 
anticipated safety risks  associated with these molecules.  Risks associated with 
atezoliz umab are described in this appendix.  Please refer to Section 6 of the 
Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for further information.  
The expected pharmacologic activit ies of atezolizumab, tiragolumab, and RO7247669 
are similar for checkpoint inhibitors as a class.  Accordingly, the adverse event 
management guidelines described in this appendix, including those for continuing, 
withholding, resuming, and discontinuing study treatment, are applicable to 
atezolizumab, tiragolumab, and RO7247669, with these exce ptions:  
 For infusion -related reactions (IRRs) associated with RO7247669 as a 
monotherapy, please refer to  Table  A12-3 in Appendix  12 and Table  A15-3 in 
Appendix  15. 
 For IRRs associated with tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab, please 
refer to Table  A13-5 in Appendix  13. 
 For IRRs associated with RO7247669 in combination with tiragolumab, please refer 
to Table  A14-4 in Appendix  14 and Table  A16-4 in Appendix  16. 
 
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab , tiragolumab, and/or 
RO7247669  treatment should be managed according to standard medical practice.  
Additional tests, such as autoimmune serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate 
for a possible immunogenic etiology  when clinically indicated . 
Although most immune -mediate d adverse events observed with immunomodulatory 
agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should be recognized early and 
treated promptly to avoid potential major complications.  Discontinuation of 
atezolizumab , tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669  may not have an immediate therapeutic 
effect, and in severe cases, immune -mediated toxicities may require acute management 
with topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive 
agents.   The investigator should consider the benefit risk balance a given patient may 
be experiencing prior to  further administration  or resumption  of atezolizumab , 
tiragolumab, or RO724669 . 
 
Appendix 9 :   Guidelines for Management of Atezolizumab -, Tiragolumab -, and/or 
RO7247669 -Specific Adverse Events  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
141/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  The following are general recommendations for management of any other adverse 
events that may occur and are not specifically listed in the following subsections  in this 
appendix or the treatment arm -specific appendices .  
 Patients and family caregivers should receive timely and up -to-date information 
about immunotherapies, their mechanism of action, and the clinical profile of 
possible immune -related adverse events prior to initiating therapy and throughout 
treatment and  long-term follow -up.  There should be a high level of suspicion that 
new symptoms are treatment related.  
 In general, atezolizumab , tiragolumab, and /or RO7247669  therapy should be 
continued with close monitoring for Grade 1 toxicities, with the exception of some 
neurologic toxicities.  
 Consider holding atezolizumab , tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669  for most Grade 2 
toxicities and resume when symptoms and/or  laboratory values resolve to Grade 1 
or better.  Corticosteroids (initial dose of 0.5 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent) may be administered.  
 For Grade 2 recurrent or persistent (lasting for more than 5 days) events, treat as a 
Grade 3 event.   
 Hold atezolizumab , tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669  for Grade 3 toxicities and 
initiate treatment with high -dose corticosteroids (1 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or 
equivalent).  Corticosteroids should be tapered over 1 month to 10 mg/day oral 
prednisone or equivalent, before atezolizumab , tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669  can 
be resumed.  If symptoms do not improve within 48 to 72 hours of high -dose 
corticosteroid use, other immunosuppressants may be offered for some toxicities.  
 In general, Grade 4 toxicities warrant perman ent discontinuation of atezolizumab , 
tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669  treatment, with the exception of endocrinopathies 
that are controlled by hormone -replacement therapy.  
 The investigator should consider the benefit risk balance for a given patient prior 
to further administration of atezolizumab , tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669 .  
Resumption of atezolizumab , tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669  may be considered in 
patients who are deriving benefit and have fully recovered from the 
immune -mediated event.  The decision to re-challenge patients with atezolizumab , 
tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669  should be based on the investigator’s assessment 
of the benefits and risks and documented by the investigator.  The Medical Monitor 
is available to advise as needed . 
 
A9–1 DOSE MODIFICATI ONS 
There will be no dose modifications for atezolizumab, tiragolumab, or RO7247669  in this 
study.

RO7247669 -Specific Adverse Events  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
142/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A9–2 TREATMENT INTERRUPTI ON 
Treatment with atezolizumab, tiragolumab, or RO7247669 may be temporarily 
suspended in patients experiencing toxicity considered to be related to study treatment.  
If corticosteroids are initiated for treatment of the toxicity, they must be tapered over 
 1 month to the equivalent of  10 mg/day oral prednisone before atezolizumab, 
tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669 can be resumed . 
For Cohort 1, treatment with atezolizumab, tiragolumab, and/or RO7247669 should not 
be interrupted unless a patient experiences toxi city.  If toxicity meets criteria for 
interrupting/withholding study drug(s), study drug(s) should be interrupted/withheld.  
After resolution of the toxicity, subsequent treatment cycles should only be considered if 
the benefit risk profile is acceptable a nd if the surgery can be conducted within 2 weeks 
of the planned date.  Otherwise, subsequent treatment cycles should be omitted to allow 
the patient to proceed directly to surgery without further delay.  
For Cohort 2,  if RO7247669 and tiragolumab are withh eld for 12  weeks or longer due to 
toxicity, the patient should be discontinued from RO7247669 and tiragolumab.  However, 
RO7247669 and tiragolumab may be withheld for more than  12 weeks to allow for 
patients to taper off corticosteroids prior to resuming t reatment.  RO7247669 and 
tiragolumab may be resumed after being withheld for more than  12 weeks if the patient is 
likely to derive clinical benefit.  RO7247669 and tiragolumab treatment may be 
suspended for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical proce dures) at the discretion of 
the investigator.  The acceptable length of the extended period of time must be based on 
the investigator’s  benefitrisk assessment  and in alignment with the protocol 
requirements for the duration of treatment and documented by the investigator .  
The Medical Monitor is available to advise as needed.  
A9–3 PULMONARY EVENTS  
Pulmonary events may present as new or worsening  cough,  chest pain, f ever, dyspnea , 
fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary infiltrates .  Patients will be assessed for 
pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study and will also have computed 
tomography (CT) scans of the chest performed at every tumor assessment.  
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported 
etiologies such as pneumonia or other infection, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary 
embolism, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pulmonary 
hypertensio n.  COVID -19 evaluation should be performed per institutional guidelines 
where relevant.   Management guidelines for pulmonary events are provided in  Table  A9-

148/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A9–6 ENDOCRINE EVENTS  
Management guidelines for endocrine events are provided in  Table  A9-4. 
Patients with unexplained symptoms such as headache, fatigue, myalgias, impotence, 
constipation, or mental status changes should  be investigated for the presence of 
thyroid, pituitary, or adrenal endocrinopathies.  Patients should be referred to an 
endocrinologist if an endocrinopathy is suspected.  Thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) 
and free triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels sh ould be measured to determine whether 
thyroid abnormalities are present.  Pituitary hormone levels and function tests 
(e.g.,  TSH, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle -stimulating hormone, 
testosterone, prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]  levels, and ACTH 
stimulation test) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (with detailed 
pituitary sections) may help to differentiate primary pituitary insufficiency from primary 
adrenal insufficiency.

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
154/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A9–9 IMMUNE -MEDIATED MYOC ARDITIS  
Immune -mediated  myocarditis should be suspected in any patient presenting with signs 
or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, including, but not limited to, laboratory 
(e.g.,  B-type natriuretic peptide) or cardiac imaging abnormalities, dyspnea, chest pain, 
palpitations, f atigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or syncope.  Myocarditis may also be 
a clinical manifestation of myositis or associated with pericarditis (see section on 
pericardial disorders below)  and should be managed accordingly.   Immune -mediated 
myocarditis nee ds to be distinguished from myocarditis resulting from infection 
(commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history of gastrointestinal illness), 
ischemic events, underlying arrhythmias, exacerbation of preexisting cardiac conditions, 
or prog ression of malignancy.  
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by performing cardiac 
enzyme assessment, an ECG, a chest X -ray, an echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist sho uld be consulted.  
An endomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of myocarditis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should b e treated according to the guidelines in  Table  A9-6. 
A9–10 IMMUNE -MEDIATED PERICARDIAL DISORDER S 
Immune -mediated pericarditis should be suspected in any patient presenting with chest 
pain and may be associated with immune -mediated myocarditis (see section on 
myocarditis above).  
Immune -mediated pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade should be suspected in 
any patient presenting with chest pain as sociated with dyspnea or hemodynamic 
instability.  
Patients should be evaluated for other causes of pericardial disorders such as infection 
(commonly viral), cancer related (metastatic disease or chest radiotherapy), cardiac 
injury related (post myocardial  infarction or iatrogenic), and autoimmune disorders, and 
should be managed accordingly.  
All patients with suspected pericardial disorders should be urgently evaluated by 
performing an ECG, chest X -ray, transthoracic echocardiogram, and cardiac MRI as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.  
Pericardiocentesis should be considered for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, if 
clinically indicated.

RO7247669 -Specific Adverse Events  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
155/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Patients with signs and symptoms of pericarditis, pericardial effusion, or cardiac 
tamponade, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated 
according to the guidelines in Table  A9-6.  Withhold treatment with atezolizumab , 
tiragolumab and/or RO7247669  for Grade 1 pericarditis and conduct a detailed cardiac 
evaluation to determine the etiology and manage accordingly.

 If event resolves to Grade 1 or better , taper corticosteroids 
over  1 month.  
ECMO   extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; VAD   ventricular assist device . 
a If a study drug warrants permanent discontinuation, there should be no re -challenge of the drug.  
For combination regimens, both study drugs should be discontinued.   
b For Cohort 2, RO7247669 and tiragolumab may be withheld for a longer period of time 
(i.e.,  12 weeks after event onset) to allow for corticosteroids (if initiated) to be reduced to the 
equivalent of  10 mg/day oral prednisone.  The acceptable length of the extended period of 
time must be  based on the investigator’s  benefitrisk assessment  and in alignment with the 
protocol requirements for the duration of treatment and documented by the investigator.  
The Medical Monitor is available to advise as needed.  
c If corticosteroids have been initiated, they must be tapered over  1 month to the e quivalent of 
 10 mg/day oral prednisone before atezolizumab/tiragolumab/RO7247669 can be resumed.  
 
A9–11 INFUSION -RELATED R EACTIONS  
No premedication is indicated for the administration of the Day 1, Cycle 1 infusion of 
tiragolumab , atezolizumab , or RO7247669 .  However, patients who experience an 
infusion -related reaction (IRR) with the Day 1, Cycle 1 infusion of tiragolumab , 
atezolizumab , or RO7247669  may receive premedication with antihistamines, antipyretic 
medication, or analgesics (e.g.,  acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.  Metamizole 
(dipyrone) is prohibited in treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of its potential 
for causing agranulocytosis.  
Appendix 9 :   Guidelines for Management of Atezolizumab -, Tiragolumab -, and/or 
RO7247669 -Specific Adverse Events  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
156/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  IRRs are known to occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have 
been reported with t iragolumab , atezolizumab , and RO7247669 .  These reactions, which 
are thought to be due to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators, occur 
within 24 hours of tiragolumab , atezolizumab , or RO7247669  administration and are 
generally mild to modera te in severity.  Refer to the beginning of this appendix 
(Appendix  9) for IRR management guidelines for each treatment arm. 
A9–12 CYTOKINE -RELEASE SYN DROME 
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab , 
tiragolumab , or RO7247669.   However, patients who experience cytokine -release 
syndrome (CRS) may receive premedication with antihistamines , anti-pyretic 
medication s, and/ or analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.   
CRS is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune 
therapy that results in activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells  and/or 
other immune effector cells.  Symptoms can be progressive, always include fever at the 
onset, and may include hypotension, capillary leak (hypoxia), and end -organ dysfunction 
(Lee et al. 2019).  CRS has been well documented with chimeric antigen re ceptor T -cell 
therapies and bispecific T -cell engager antibody therapies but has also been reported 
with immunotherapies that target PD -1 or PD -L1 (Rotz et al. 2017; Adashek and 
Feldman 2019), including atezolizumab.  
Guidelines for medical management of CRS are provided in  Table  A9-7.  
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS -CoV-2) infection appears to be 
associated with a CRS involving the inflammatory  cytokines  interleukin  (IL)-6, IL-10, IL -2, 
and IFN - (Merad and Martin 2020).  If a patient develops suspected CRS during the 
study, a differential diagnosis should include SARS -CoV-2 infection , which should be 
confirmed or refut ed through assessment of exposure history, appropriate laboratory 
testing, and clinical or radiologic evaluations per investigator ’s judgment.  If a diagnosis 
of SARS -CoV-2 infection  is confirmed, the disease should be managed as per local or 
institutional  guidelines.

Notes:  The management guidelines have been adapted from the NCCN guidelines  for 
the management of CAR T -cellrelated toxicities (Version 2.2019).  
a Grading system for management guidelines is based on ASTCT consensus grading 
scale.  NCI CTCAE v5.0 and the ASTCT CRS consensus grading scale should be used 
when reporting severity of CRS on the Adverse Event eCRF.  NCI CTCAE v5.0 should 
be used when reporting severity of organ toxicities associated with CRS on the 
dedicated Cytokine -Release Syndrome eCRF .  Organ toxicities associated with CRS 
should not influence overall CRS grading.  
b Fever is defined as temperature  38C not attributable to any other cause.  In patients 
who develop CRS and then receive anti -pyretic, anti -cytokine, or corticosteroid therapy, 
fever is no longer required when su bsequently determining event severity (grade).  
In this case, the grade is driven by the presence of hypotension and/or hypoxia.  
c Symptomatic treatment may include oral or IV antihistamines, anti-pyretic medications , 
analgesics, bronchodilators, and/or ox ygen.  For bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, 
additional treatment may be administered as per institutional practice.

Immune -mediated  meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient presenting 
with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis, including, but not 
limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor or sensory dysfunction, and 
altered or depress ed level of consciousness.  Encephalopathy from metabolic or 
electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from potential meningoencephalitis 
resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or progression of malignancy, or 
secondary to a paraneop lastic process.  
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with 
a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or 
edema.  If deemed safe by the treating physician, a lumbar puncture should be 
performed and a neurologist should be consulted.

Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders  sharing the common 
feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and polymyositis are among the 
most common disorders.  Initial diagnosis is based on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle 
pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), biochemical (serum creati ne kinase increase), and 
imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy.   
Patients with possible myositis should be referred to a rheumatologist or neurologist.  
Patients with possible myositis should be monitored for signs of myocarditis.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in  Table  A9-14.

A9–19 HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPH OHISTIOCYTOSIS AND 
MACROPHAGE ACTIVATIO N SYNDROME  
Immune -mediated reactions may involve any organ system and lead to hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)  and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which  are 
considered to be potential risks for atezolizumab.  
Clinical and laboratory features of severe CRS overlap with HLH, and HLH should be 
considered when CRS presentation is atypical or prolonged.

180/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A11–1 BACKGROUND ON NIVO   IPI ARM  
A11–1.1 BACKGROUND ON NIVOLU MAB 
Nivolumab  (Nivo)  is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the human PD-1 
receptor.  Nivolumab is approved for the treatment of several cancer types, including 
melanoma.  It is approved as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab for the 
treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, and as monotherapy for 
the adjuvant t reatment of patients with melanoma.  
For detailed information, refer to the local prescribing information for nivolumab . 
A11–1.2 BACKGROUND ON IPILIMUMAB  
Ipilimumab  (Ipi) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA -4 and inhibits 
its interaction with ligands on antigen -presenting cells.  
Ipilimumab is approved for the treatment of several cancer types, including melanoma.  
It is approved as monotherapy or in com bination with nivolumab for the treatment of 
advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma, and as monotherapy for the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with melanoma.  
For detailed information, refer to the local prescribing information for i pilimumab . 
A11–2 RATIONALE FOR NIVO   IPI ARM 
A11–2.1 COMBINATION TREATMEN T WITH NIVOLUMAB AND  
IPILIMUMAB 
Nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab is an  approved treatment option for advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma.  
A11–2.2 CLINICAL STUDIES OF NIVOLUMAB IN COMBINA TION WITH 
IPILIMUMAB IN MELANOMA  
In the Phase III CheckMate 067 study, nivolumab monotherapy or combination therapy 
with nivolumab and ipilimumab  was compared with  ipilimumab monotherapy  in patients 
with metastatic melanoma .  The co-primary endpoints  for this study were 
progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) .  Nivolumab monotherapy and 
combination therapy with nivolumab   ipilimumab  demonstrated superior  survival benefit 
when compared with ipilimumab monotherapy .  Combination therap y provided  the 
greatest clinical benefit,  with patients receiving this treatment having  the highest overall 
response (OR) and complete response (CR) rates ( 58% and 22% , respectively , for 
nivolumab   ipilimumab combination therapy;  45% and 19% for nivolumab  monotherapy ; 
and 19% and 6% for ipilimumab monotherapy ) (Larkin et al. 2015 ; Wolchok et al. 2017; 
Larkin et al. 2019) . 
As a result of clinical evidence demonstrated in the metastatic setting, combination 
therapy with nivolumab   ipilimumab was investigated  in patients with macroscopic 
Appendix 11:  Study Details Specific to Nivo   Ipi Arm (Control)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
181/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Stage III melanoma.  The OpACIN study  (Blank et al. 2018 ) investigated the benefit of 
neoadjuvant versus adjuvant treatment with nivolumab   ipilimumab on relapse -free 
survival (RFS) and OS,  and proposed superior b enefit for the neoadjuvant use . 
Combination treatment with nivolumab   ipilimumab presents more safety concerns than 
treatment with either nivolumab or ipilimumab alone, as serious toxicities and the need 
for treatment discontinuation occur more frequently  in patients treated with 
nivolumab   ipilimumab  (Schadendorf et al. 2017 ; Shous htari et al. 2018 ).  These 
toxicities have  also been  seen in patients with Stage III melanoma who received 
nivolumab   ipilimumab as neoadjuvant therapy, and they were severe e nough to impact 
the timing of surgical intervention.  Therefore, different schedules of treatment with 
nivolumab   ipilimumab combination  therapy  were explored in the OpACIN -neo study .  
An alternative off -label dosing regimen  (nivolumab 3 mg/kg   ipilimumab 1 mg/kg) was 
found to retain comparable pathological response rates while decreasing toxicities  
(Rozeman et al. 2019) . 
A11–2.3 BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT  
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are approved treatment option s for patients with  melanoma  
and have demonstrated a favorable benefit risk assessment .  Moreover, combination 
therapy with nivolumab   ipilimumab is approved in the advanced  setting  for 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma . 
More detailed information about known and expected benefits in the context of potential 
risks and expected adverse events related to  nivolumab and ipilimumab  administration  is 
provided in the local prescribing information for each agent . 
For the evaluation of the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) pandemic 
on the benefit risk assessment, refer to Section 1.3. 
A11–3 RATIONALE FOR DOSE A ND SCHEDULE FOR NIVO   IPI ARM  
The approved combination regimen for metastatic melanoma is nivolumab (1 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks [Q3W] for four doses)   ipilimumab (3 mg/kg Q3W  for four doses), 
followed by  nivolumab  3 mg/kg every two weeks .  An alternative dosing regimen of 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab  1 mg/kg was identified in  the OpACIN -neo study as 
the optimal  neoadjuvant dosing regimen in melanoma, with comparable clinic al efficacy 
and improved tolerability (Rozeman et al. 2019) . 
Appendix 11:  Study Details Specific to Nivo   Ipi Arm (Control)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
182/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Given the evidence of clinical efficacy in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings , and 
the fact that nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab is approved for patients with 
advanced melanoma, combination t reatment with nivolumab 3 mg/kg   ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg was considered to be the best comparator for the anticipated patient population 
in this study (Wolchok et al. 2013; Sznol et al. 2014; Rozeman et al. 2019 ). 
Nivolumab will be administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg IV and ipilimumab will be 
administered at a dose of 1  mg/kg IV Q3W on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle .

the event; see Section  5.4.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e.,  no 
more than 24  hours after learning of th e event; see Section  5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or

197/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A12–1 BACKGROUND ON RO7247 669 2100 mg ARM 
RO7247669 is a novel, Fc -silent IgG1 -based bispecific antibody (bsAb) in 1   1 format 
that incorporates monovalent binding to two immune checkpoint proteins:  PD -1 and 
LAG-3.  RO7247669 is designed to target dysfunctional tumor antigen -specific 
T-lymphocyt es expressing PD -1 and LAG -3 to establish or re -establish an effective 
anti-tumor immune response in cancer patients .  This may result in improved therapeutic 
responses over currently available therapies.  In  addition, RO7247669 is engineered to 
prevent bi nding to Fc gamma receptors, thus potentially avoiding tumor -associated 
macrophage resistance mechanisms .  Such mechanisms  have been observed with 
IgG4 -based anti PD-1 antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab (Arlauckas 
et al. 2017).  Clinical evaluation of RO7247669 is ongoing in a first -in-human, 
dose -finding study  (NP41300 ) as a single  agent in cancer patients with and without prior 
checkpoint inhibitor ( CPI) exposure .   
Refer to the RO7247669 Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinica l and other 
planned and ongoing clinical studies.  
A12–2 RATIONALE FOR RO7247 669 2100 mg ARM 
A12–2.1 TARGETING THE PD -1 AND LAG -3 ANTIGENS  
Cancer immunotherapy agents, particularly immune CPIs, have  had a significant impact 
on the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies in recent years.  However, 
despite the remarkable clinical efficacy of these therapies, additional treatment options 
targeting immune checkpoints are needed because the majori ty of patients eventually 
progress after an initial response or else fail to respond to the PD -1/PD-L1 checkpoint 
blockade.  This is believed to be due mainly to primary or secondary resistance 
mechanisms , to immunosuppressive activity of myeloid -derived s uppressor cells , and/or 
to T-regulatory cells (Sharma et al. 2017).  
To overcome resistance  mechanisms , additional treatment options and multiple 
combinations with anti PD-L1 therapy are being assessed.   One potential reason for 
resistance to anti PD-L1 therapy is the upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints 
with non -redundant regulatory functions (Sharma et al . 2017).  LAG-3 is one such 
alternative immune checkpoint.  LAG-3 is a member of the Ig superfamily  that is 
structurally similar to CD4 .  LAG-3 is expressed on activated effector T cells and is 
constitutively expressed  on T-regulatory cells and natural killer ( NK) cells.  The 
expression of both PD -1 and LAG -3 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL s) correlates 
with the degree of impairment of effector functions, which is associated with poor 
prognosis ( Matsuzaki  et al. 2010 ; Baitsch et al . 2011 ; Thommen et al . 2015).  Hence, 
LAG-3 is a marker of T -cell dysfunctionality .  LAG -3 also regulates T -cell functions, 
presumably including  the function of T-regulatory cells .  In chronic infections and cancer, 
LAG-3, together with PD -1, contributes to T -cellacquired dysfunctionality and to the  
Appendix 12: Study Details Specific to RO7247669 2100 mg  Arm 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
198/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  inability of T cells to mount an effective/protective immune  response upon interaction 
with the LAG -3 ligand , MHC -II. 
The interaction of LAG -3 with MHC -II inhibits T -cell proliferation, activation, cytolytic 
function, and proinflammatory cytokine production (Goldberg and Drake 201 1).  The 
effect of LAG -3 expression on T-regulatory cells is controversial.  An early report 
concluded that LAG -3 promotes T-regulatory cell -mediated immune suppression  
(Camisaschi et al. 2010).  However, a more recent report from the same authors found 
that LAG-3 limit s T-regulatory cell -mediated immune suppression (Zhang et al. 2017).  
Expression of LAG -3 has been reported across various tumor types, including breast 
cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), melanoma, renal cell 
cancer ( RCC ), prostate cancer, and hepatocell ular carcinoma ( HCC ).  In patients with 
these tumor types, LAG -3 is associated with poor prognosis (Matsuzaki et al. 2010; 
Baitsch et al. 2011; Thommen et al. 2015; He et al. 2016; Norstrom et al. 2016).  Clinical 
evaluation of anti LAG-3 agents, as single  agent s and in combination with other CPIs, is 
ongoing in several early phase studies in patients with advance d solid tumors 
(Long  et al. 2018).  Preliminary data demonstrate that anti LAG-3 therapy is well 
tolerated, both as single agent s and in combinati on with anti PD-1 therapies, and the 
safety profiles are consistent with those of other CPIs (Ascierto et al. 2017; 
Hong  et al. 2018; Stratton  et al. 2018).   RO7247669 may therefore be a therapeutic 
option for patients with melanoma.  
Resistance to PD -L1/PD -1 blockade may result in the expression of multiple co -inhibitory 
immune checkpoints on the surface of effector T cells.  LAG -3 is frequently 
co-expressed with PD -1 on TILs, and dual blockade of PD -1 and LAG -3 enhance s 
CD8 T-cell effector function and potentiate s anti-tumor immunity in nonclinical models.  
Blockade of these two receptors in mice with colon, fibrosarcoma, or ovarian tumors 
resulted in tumor remission in approximately 80% of animals , compared with remission 
in 10% to 40% with blockade of either receptor using a single  agent (Woo et al. 2012; 
Huang et al. 2015).  TILs from patients with ovarian cancer showed that antigen -specific 
CD8 T cells co -expressing PD -1 and LAG -3 exhibited greater impairment in their ability 
to respond to cognate an tigen stimulation compared with CD8 T cells that expressed 
one checkpoint molecule (Matsuzaki et al. 2010).  In patients with NSCLC, 
overexpression of LAG -3 on TILs correlated with PD -1/PD -L1 expression and was linked 
to higher risk of recurrence and poor  survival outcomes (He et al. 2017).  
A12–2.2 CLINICAL STUDIES OF AGENTS TARGETING THE  PD-1 AND 
LAG-3 PATHWAYS  
Clinical data are available for early - and late -phase studies that evaluat ed the safety, 
tolerability, and preliminary anti -tumor activity of agents that target both the PD -1 and 
LAG-3 pathways.  Evidence of clinical activity has been reported in some of these 
Appendix 12: Study Details Specific to RO7247669 2100 mg  Arm 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
199/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  studies.  Overall, adverse events have been manageable to date, and the safety profiles 
appear similar to those of single -agent CPIs.  
An ongoing Phas e I/IIa study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of 
combination treatment with the anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab and the 
antiLAG-3 monoclonal antibody relatlimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.  
Preliminary dat a suggest that the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab may have an  
increased benefit compared with single -agent anti PD-1.  In a cohort of patients who 
had advanced melanoma who were previously treated with anti PD-1/PD -L1 agents , the 
ORR was 11.5% (n   61) with a disease control rate (DCR)  of 49%.  The 
antiPD-1/PD -L1 treatment  combination had an acceptable safety profile  that was  
similar to the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy (Ascierto et al. 2017).  
Relativity -047 is a phase III study evaluati ng the combination of nivolumab 
(antiPD-1) and relatlimab (anti LAG -3) versus nivolumab alone in patients with 
untreated advanced melanoma.  This study demonstrated that nivolumab and relatlimab  
improved progression -free survival  (PFS   10.1 months) over nivolumab  
(PFS   4.6 months).  The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related adverse events was 
18.9% in patients that received the nivolumab and relatlimab combination and 9.7% in 
patients that received nivolumab alonoe (Tawbi et al. 2022 ).  
An ongoing Phase I/II study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of 
combination treatment with the anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody spartalizumab and the 
antiLAG-3 monoclonal antibody LAG525 in patients with advanced solid tumors.  
Preliminary anti-tumor activity was observed during the Phase I dose -escalation portion 
of the study, including durable responses in 2 of 5  patients  with triple -negative breast 
cancer (TNBC)  and in 2 of 8 patients with mesothelioma.  Analyses of tumor biopsies 
from th e TNBC cohort also showed a trend of conversion from an immune -cold to an 
immune -activated phenotype.  Common adverse events , i.e., adverse events reported in 
 10% of patients , included fatigue (18%), diarrhea (15%), and nausea (12%).  
The incidence of Grade 34 adverse events was 8% for both the combination (n   121) 
and monotherapy (n   119) arms (Hong et al. 2018).  
An ongoing, first -in-human, dose -escalation, and dose -expansion Phase I study is 
evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activit y of the anti PD-1/LAG -3 dual affinity 
re-targeting protein (DART®) bsAb MGD013 in patients with advanced solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies.  During the dose -escalation phase of the study, the maximum  
tolerated dose ( MTD ) was not reached, and the s afety profile was consistent with 
antiPD-1 monotherapy.  During the dose -expansion phase, anti -tumor activity was 
observed in patients with TNBC (n   23; ORR, 4.3%; DCR , 39.1%), CPI -naive NSCLC 
(n  14; ORR, 14.3%; DCR, 64.3%), and epithelial ovarian canc er (n   23; ORR, 8.7%; 
DCR, 52.2%).  Expression of LAG -3 and an IFN - gene signature at baseline was

MGD013 as monotherapy and in combination with anti HER -2 agents are ongoing.  
A12–2.2.1 Study NP41300  
Study NP41300 is an ongoing, first -in-human, dose -escalation, dose -expansion Phase I 
study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic activity of the 
antiPD-1/LAG -3 bsAb RO7247669 as a single  agent in patients with lo cally advanced 
and/or metastatic solid tumors.  Part A , the dose -escalation  phase  of the study , is 
designed to determine the MTD and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of 
RO7247669.  Part B of the study is designed to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of 
RO7247669 at the MTD or RDE in tumor -specific expansion cohorts.  
As of the data cut -off date  of 1 March  2022, RO7247669 was well tolerated in the 
patients enrolled in Part A of the study.  No unexpected safety concern associated with 
RO7247669 was identified.  No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed up to the 
maximum dose tested (2100 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W]),  and no MTD was identified.  
The maximum dose of 2100 mg was determined to be the recommended dose for the 
dose -expansion phase (Part B) of Study NP41300.   As of the data cutoff of 
1 March  2022, 83 patients received treatment in Part B.   
As of the data cutoff date  of 1 March  2022, the DCR in Part A of the study was 51. 4% 
(18 of 35 evaluable patients) , and the ORR was 17.1% ( 6 of 35 patients).  Among the 
patients treated with  the proposed dose of 2100 mg Q2W, 7 of 13 patients had a best 
response of  stable disease or better (DCR   53.8%), including 4 patients with a 
confirmed partial response ( PR; ORR   30.8%) .  Besides the confirmed p artial responses 
(cPR) observed at the RDE , there were 2 cPRs at the 600 mg dose level (ORR   50.0%).  
As of the data cutoff date, 1 March 2022, in Part B of the study the DCR was 48.3% 
(28 of 58 patients) and the ORR was 5.2% (3 of 58 patients)  among patients of the 
study treated at the RDE of 2100 mq Q2W ( Cohort s B1, B2 , and B3).  Within patients 
treated with 600 mg Q2W ( Cohort B5),  the DCR was 40% (4 of  10 patients), and the 
ORR was 10% (1 of 10 patients).  Among patients treated with 600 mg Q3W, the DCR 
was 28.6% (2 of 7 patients) and  the ORR was 14.3% (1 of 7 patients).  
Refer to the RO7247669 Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on all ongoing and 
planned clinical studies.  
A12–2.3 BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT  
Despite limited clinical experience with  RO7247669, the clinical efficacy and safety 
profiles of anti PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies are well characterized and 
established.  In recent years, four checkpoint inhibitors, namely pembrolizumab, 
Appendix 12: Study Details Specific to RO7247669 2100 mg  Arm 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
201/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  nivolumab, ipilimumab , and relatlimab  have been approved by the FDA for the treatment 
of unresectable or advanced melanoma.   
The co -stimulatory action of RO7247669 on PD -1 and LAG -3 receptors may result in 
enhanced and/or more durable responses than either therapy modality alone.  However, 
there may be a risk of exaggerated immune cell activation, particularly given the LAG -3 
modulation  of the immune response .  Preliminary data from Study NP41300, and recent 
early phase studies of anti LAG-3 antibodies showed that antiLAG-3 therapy was 
generally well tolerated as monotherapy or in combination with anti PD-1 therapies , and 
that it had a safety profile consistent with the safety profiles of other CPIs ( Ascierto et al . 
2017 ; Hong et al . 2018 ; Stratton et al. 2018 ).  The safety and efficacy of CPIs is 
established in the adjuvant setting, and CPIs are now  being  actively evaluated as 
neoadjuvant treatment and show promising early results (Herrscher and Robert 2020).  
To evaluate  the toxicities of the experimental treatments in the neoadjuvant setting, a 
minimum of 6 patients in the RO7247669 2100 mg arm must complete a safety 
evaluation before additional patients can be enrolled in that arm (refer to Section  3.1.3  
for details).  
For the evaluation of the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) pandemic 
on the benefit risk assessment, please refer to Section 1.3. 
A12–3 RATIONALE FOR DOSE A ND SCHEDULE FOR RO72 47669 
2100  mg ARM 
A12–3.1 RATIONALE FOR RO7247 669 DOSE AND SCHEDUL E 
RO7247669 will be administered at a fixed dose of 2100 mg Q3W (2100  mg on Day 1 of 
each 21-day cycle).  A fixed dosing regimen of 2100 mg Q3W was selected based on 
available clinical pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data from Study NP41300.  
During the dose -escalation Part A of the study, RO7247669 was well tolerated, and no 
specific saf ety concern associated with RO7247669 was identified.  No DLT up to the 
highest dose of 2100 mg Q2W was observed, and no MTD was identified.  Anti -tumor 
activity, as measured by radiographic PRs, was observed starting at a dose of 600 mg 
Q2W.  PK results f or RO7247669 were dose linear within the dose range tested in 
Study  NP41300 and were therefore predicted to be in the range of target saturation.  
Peripheral receptor occupancy was   90% ~80 days after administration; therefore, Q3W 
administration should result in similar receptor occupancy as Q2W administration . 
In addition, RO7247669 was well tolerated in both the dose range finding studies and 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) monkey t oxicology studies up to the highest dose 
evaluated (100 mg/kg).  Toxicology findings were consistent with the findings in 
cynomolgus monkey studies of marketed CPIs.

205/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A12–4.2.2 Cautionary Therapy for RO7247669  2100 mg  Arm 
A12–4.2.2.1 Corticosteroids, Immunos uppressive Medications, and Tumor 
Necrosis Factor - Inhibitors  
Systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, and tumor necrosis factor  
(TNF )- inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment 
with RO7247669.  Therefore, in situations in which systemic corticosteroids, 
immunosuppressive medications, or TNF - inhibitors would be routinely administered, 
alternatives, i ncluding antihistamines, should be considered.  If the alternatives are not 
feasible, systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, and TNF - 
inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Systemic corticosteroids or immun osuppressive medications are recommended, at the 
discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events when 
associated with RO7247669 therapy (see Appendix  9 for de tails).  
A12–4.2.2.2 Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  However, herbal t herapies not intended for the treatment of cancer 
(see Section A12–4.2.3 ) may be used during the study at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
A12–4.2.3 Prohibited Therapy for RO7247669  2100 mg  Arm 
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited for 
various time peri ods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent 
(see Section  4.1.2 ), and during study treatment until surgery or , if earlier,  disease 
progression is documented and the patient has discontinued study treatment . 
 Investigational therapy is prohibited within 28 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment and during study treatment.  
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g.,  FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment, during treatment with RO7247669, and for 4  months 
after the final dose of RO7247669.  
 Systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferons and 
interleukin -2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 drug -elimination half -lives 
(whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment 
because these agents could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions 
when given in combination with RO7247669.

206/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A12–4.3 CONTRACEPTION REQUIR EMENTS FOR RO7247669  2100 mg 
ARM 
Contraception requirements for women and men in the RO7247669 2100 mg arm are 
outlined below:  
 For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:  
Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate 
of  1% per year during the treatment period and for 4 months after the final 
dose of RO7247669.  
A woman is consi dered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal , 
has not reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not 
permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of o varies, fallopian tubes, 
and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator 
(e.g.,  Müllerian agenesis).  The definition of childbearing potential may be 
adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.  
Examples of contraceptive me thods with a failure rate of  1% per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence s hould be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable  methods o f contraception.  
If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized acceptable  
methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will 
be described in the local Informed Consent Form.  
 For men:  agreement to remai n abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or 
use contraception, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:  
With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant or a 
pregnant female partner, men who are not surg ically sterile must remain 
abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that 
together result in a failure rate of  1% per year during the treatment period, for 
4 months after the last dose of RO7247669 to avoid exposing the embryo.  
Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.

A12–5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  FOR RO7247669  2100 mg ARM 
A12–5.1 SAFETY PLAN FOR RO7247669  2100 mg ARM 
The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with RO7247669 
in ongoing studies.  The potential safety risks are outlined below  (see Section  A12–
5.1.1 ).  Guidelines for management of patients who experience specific adverse events 
are provided in  Section  A12–5.1.2  and Appendix  9. 
Measures  will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, 
including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of 
patients during the study.  Special caution will be taken by performing a planned safety 
evaluation phase for patients randomized to this arm (see  Section  3.1.3 ). 
Administration of study treatment will be performed in a monitored setting in which there 
is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment and medicine to 
manage potentially serious reactions.  Adverse events will be reported as described in  
Sections 5.25.6. 
A12–5.1.1 Risks Associated with RO 7247669  
Clinical evaluation of RO7247669 is ongoing, and not all risks are known.  As an 
antagonist of PD -1 and LAG -3, RO7247669 is anticipated to enhance T -cell and NK -cell 
proliferation, survival, and function.  Based on the mechanism -of-action of RO7247 669, 
the safety profile is anticipated to be similar to other CPIs.  Potential risks associated 
with RO7247669 include the following:  IRRs (including anaphylaxis), immunogenicity, 
and immune -mediated adverse events.  Refer to Section  6 of the RO7247669 
Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for 
RO7247669.  
A12–5.1.1.1 Infusion -Related Reactions and Anaphylaxis  
Administration of therapeutic antibodies may cause IRRs, which may include symptoms 
such as fever, chills, hypotension, shortness of breath, skin rash, headache, nausea, 
and vomiting.  Such reactions typically occur during or shortly after the infusion and are 
predominantly reported following the first infusion.  The incidence and severity of IRRs 
typically decrease with su bsequent infusions.  Based on in vitro data, the risk of 
proinflammatory cytokine -mediated IRRs on first administration of RO7247669 as a 
single agent is considered low.

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
208/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Refer to Section  A12–4.1.2  for detailed guidance on administration of RO7247669 in this 
study.  Refer to Appendix  8 for guidance on anaphylaxis precautions and to 
Section  A12–5.1.2.3  for guidance on the management of IRRs.  
A12–5.1.1.2 Immunogenicity  
Administration of therapeutic antibodies may cause the formation of anti -drug antibodies, 
which may negatively affect the safety of the therapeutic (e.g., allergic reactions, 
immune complex -mediated diseases).  
A12–5.1.1.3 Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
The co -stimulatory action of RO7247669, in pa rticular its effects on  LAG-3, may lead to 
an exaggerated risk of  immune cell activation that may result in the occurrence of 
enhanced, untoward, immune -mediated adverse events and increased 
cytokine  release -mediated toxicities.  
Toxicities from PD -1 blocki ng agents can involve any organ or tissue, although some 
immune -mediated adverse events occur much more frequently than others.  The most 
frequently occurring immune -mediated adverse events affect skin, colon, endocrine 
organs, liver, and lungs.  Others ar e very infrequent but may be very serious, even 
lethal, such as neurological disorders and myocarditis.  
The limited data from recent early phase studies showed antiLAG-3 therapy was 
generally well tolerated as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies, 
and data were consistent with the safety profiles of other CPIs (Ascierto et  al. 2017; 
Hong et al. 2018).  
In this study, specified immune -mediated adverse events will be considered adverse 
events of special interest and will be captured accord ingly (see Section  A12–5.2 for the 
list of adverse events of special interest and Section  5.4.2  for reporting ins tructions).  
Patients with a history of autoimmune disease will be excluded from this study.   Please 
see Section  4.1.2  for details.  
A12–5.1.2 Management of Patients Who Experience Specific Adverse 
Events in RO7247669  2100 mg  Arm 
A12–5.1.2.1 Dose Modifications  
There will be no dose modifications for RO7247669 in this study.  
A12–5.1.2.2 Treatment Interruption for Toxicities  
RO7247669 treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxicity 
considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are initiated for treatment 
of the toxicity, they must be tapered over 1 month to 10 mg/day oral prednisone or 
equivalent before RO7247669  can be resumed  if warranted.   In the neoadjuvant setting , 
Appendix 12: Study Details Specific to RO7247669 2100 mg  Arm 
 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
209/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  the study treatment is limited to a pre-surgery window  of 6 weeks.  Treatment during this 
period should not be interrupted , unless a patient experiences toxicity.  If toxicity meets  
criteria for interrupting/withholding RO7247669 , RO7247669  should be 
interrupted/withheld.  After resolution of the toxicity, subsequent treatment cycles should 
only be considered if the benefit -risk profile is acceptable and if the surgery can be 
conducted within 2 weeks of the planned date.  Otherwise, subsequent treatment cycles 
should be omitted to allow the patient to proceed directly to surgery without further delay .

Event  Action to Be Taken  
IRRs, anaphylaxis, and hypersensitivity reaction s 
General guidance   For anaphylaxis precautions,  see Appendix  8. 
 For severe hypersensitivity reactions, permanently discontinue RO7247669.  
 For suspected CRS, see Appendix  9 for guidance on supportive care . 
 Determine tryptase concentration and IgE titer if clinical presentation of IRR suggests an anaphylactic or 
hypersensitivity reaction (hives, obstructive shortness of breath, urtica ria, other histamine associated 
symptoms) and/or if the first IRR or CRS (  Grade 2) is observed at the second infusion.  If tryptase 
and/or IgE are elevated, collect a second sample for IgE/tryptase analysis at least 48  hours after the 
onset  of the reaction to rule out the possibility of an anaphylactic reaction.   
IRR to RO7247669, Grade 1 or 2   Slow infusion to 50% or interrupt infusion.  
 Give supportive treatment.  Patients should be treated with acetaminophen/paracetamol and an 
antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine, if they have not been administered in the last 4 hours.  IV fluids 
(e.g., normal saline) may be administered as clinically indicated.  For bronchospasm, urticaria, or 
dyspnea, antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent), and/or 
bronchodilators may be administered per institutional practice.  
 Upon symptom resolution, infusion may resume (if interrupted) at 50% starting rate.  The infusion must 
remain at the lower rate resulting i n symptom resolution for the remainder of the infusion.  
 For Grade 2 IRRs, subsequent doses of RO7247669 should be administered with pre -medication, 
including acetaminophen/paracetamol and an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine.  
 For Grade 2 wheezing or ur ticaria, patient must also be pre -medicated prior to subsequent doses 
(as described above).  
 If symptoms recur with the same or greater severity following the slower or interrupted infusion, the 
infusion must be stopped immediately.  No further RO7247669 wi ll be administered for the cycle.

RO7247669  2100 mg ARM (IMMEDIATELY REPORTABLE TO 
THE SPONSOR)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section  5.2.3  for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for the 
RO7247669 2100 mg arm are as follows:  
 Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST  in 
combination with either elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's Law 
(see Section  5.3.5.7 ) 
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study treatment, as defined 
below : 
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmiss ion of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only 
when a contamination of study treatment is suspected.  
 
A12–5.3 REPORTING REQUI REMENTS FOR PREGNANC IES IN 
RO7247669  2100 mg ARM 
A12–5.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Informed Consent 
Form to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study o r 
within 4 months after the final dose of RO7247669.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by 
faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address 
provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study treatment and counsel the patient, 
discussing t he risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring 
of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse 
events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother 
during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be 
reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical 
Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and ou tcome 
of the pregnancy becomes available.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When permitted 
by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health Information 
would need to be signed by one or both parents (as per local regulations) to allow for 
Appendix 1 2:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg  Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
213/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's health status at 
birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form.  In addition, the 
Sponsor may collect fol low-up information on the infant's health status at 6 and 
12 months after birth.  
A12–5.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients  
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner beco mes pregnant during the study or within 
4 months after the final dose of RO7247669.  The investigator should report the 
pregnancy on the  paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit the form to 
the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no  more than 24 hours after learning of the 
pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number 
or email address provided to investigators.  Attempts should be made to collect and 
report details of the course and outcome of  any pregnancy in the partner of a male 
patient exposed to study treatment.  When permitted by the site, the pregnant partner 
would need to sign an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health 
Information to allow for follow -up on her pregn ancy.  If the authorization has been 
signed, the investigator should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form with 
additional information on the pregnant partner and the course and outcome of the 
pregnancy as it becomes available.  
Attempts should b e made to collect and report infant health information.  When permitted 
by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health Information 
would need to be signed by one or both parents (as per local regulations) to allow for 
follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's health status at 
birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form.  In addition, the 
Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant's health status at 6 and 
12 months after birth.  
An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide 
information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, to 
support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating  physician and/or 
obstetrician.  
A12–5.3.3 Abortions  
A spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as  the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately ( i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section 5.2.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
Appendix 1 2:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg  Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
214/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.2.2 ).  A therapeu tic or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.  
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
A12–5.3.4 Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study 
treatment or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study treatment should be 
classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.2.2 ).

219/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  f After initiation of study treatment, all  adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new 
systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs fi rst, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will continue to be 
reported until 135 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  After 
this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  In addition, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes  aware of 
any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior exposure to study treatment (see Section 5.6).  For details on reporting all 
treatment -related non -serious adverse events that lead to surgical delay, see Section  5.6.  The investigator should follow each adverse event 
until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is  lost to follow -up, or the 
patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study t reatment or trial -
related procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
g Regardless of whether they complete the study drug tr eatment period or discontinue study drug prematurely, patients who proceed to surgery 
will have their first long-term follow -up visit 3 months after surgery and patients who do not proceed to surgery will have their first long-term 
follow -up visit 3 months  after the final dose of study treatment.  Information on long -term follow -up and new anti -cancer therapy (including 
targeted therapy and immunotherapy) will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits appr oximately ever y 
3 months until death (unless the patient withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study).  If a patient requests to be w ithdrawn from 
follow -up, this request must be documented in the source documents and signed by the investigator.  If a patient withdraws from the study, the 
study staff may use a public information source (e.g., county records) to obtain information about survival status only.  For  an experimental arm 
in which all patients discontinued treatment and passed the safety follow -up win dow, as well as approximately 80% of patients discontinued the 
study, the Sponsor may conclude the arm (the remaining ~20% of patients will be discontinued from the study).  
h Laboratory tests must be performed within 72 hours prior to dosing during the tre atment period.   If screening laboratory assessments were 
performed within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1, they do not have to be repeated.  
i At the pre -surgery visit, adrenocorticotropic hormone , cortisol, S100, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate will be included in the chemistry panel.  
j This is only applicable if elevated levels of cardiac enzymes were detected in previous assessments.  
k If periods are missed or delayed before the 6 -month follow -up visit, pregnancy testing should be repeated.  This te st can be performed by a local 
gynecologist.  
l The Cycle 2 Day 1 on -treatment tissue sample must be collected up to 72 hours prior to drug administration.

225/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A13–1 BACKGROUND ON ATEZO   TIRA ARM  
A13–1.1 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOL IZUMAB  
Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets PD -L1 and inhibits 
the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80), 
both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T  cells.  Therapeutic 
blockade of PD -L1 binding by atezolizumab enhance s the magnitude and quality of 
tumor -specific T -cell responses, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity (Fehrenbacher 
et al. 2016; Rosenberg et al. 2016).  Atezolizumab has minimal  binding to Fc receptors, 
thus eliminating  detectable Fc -effector function and associated antibody -mediated 
clearance of activated effector T  cells.  
Atezolizumab shows anti -tumor activity in both nonclinical models and cancer patients 
and is being investigated as a potential therapy in a wide vari ety of malignancies.  
Atezolizumab is being studied as a single agent in the advanced cancer and adjuvant 
therapy settings as well as in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and 
cancer immunotherapy.  
Atezolizumab is approved for the treatment o f urothelial carcinoma, non small cell lung 
cancer, small -cell lung cancer, triple -negative breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
and melanoma.  
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for details on nonclinical and 
clinical  studies.  
A13–1.2 BACKGROUND  ON TIRAGOLUMAB  
Tiragolumab is a fully human IgG1/kappa monoclonal antibody that binds TIGIT  and 
prevents its interaction with CD155 (also known as poliovirus receptor [PVR]).  
Therapeutic blockade of TIGIT by tiragolumab represents an attractive strategy for 
cancer therapy and is expected to enhance the magnitude and quality of tumor -specific 
T-cell responses.  This may result in improved meaningful anti -tumor activity when 
tiragolumab is used in combination with other cancer immunotherapies and administered 
with chemotherapy.  The available nonclinical and clinical data provide a strong rational e 
for evaluating the potential clinical benefit of tiragolumab in cancer patients.  
Refer to the Tiragolumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical 
studies.

A13–2.1 THE PD-L1 PATHWAY  
Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have 
demonstrated that therapies focused on enhancing T -cell responses against cancer can 
result in a significant survival benefit in patients with advanced malignancies 
(Hodi  et al. 2010; Kantoff et al. 2010; C hen et al. 2012).  
The PD -L1 pathway serves as an immune checkpoint to temporarily dampen immune 
responses in states of chronic antigen stimulation, such as chronic infection or cancer.  
PD-L1 is an extracellular protein that downregulates immune responses by binding to its 
two receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1.  PD -1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells 
following T -cell activation, and its expression is sustained in states of chronic stimulation 
(Blank  et al. 2005; Keir et al. 2008).  B7 -1 is a molecule ex pressed on 
antigen -presenting cells and activated T cells.  Binding of PD -L1 to PD -1 and B7 -1 
inhibits T -cell proliferation and activation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity, 
leading to the functional inactivation or exhaustion of T  cells (Butte et al. 2007; 
Yang  et al. 2011).  Overexpression of PD -L1 on tumor cells has been reported to impede 
anti-tumor immunity, resulting in immune evasion (Blank and Mackensen 2007).  
Therefore, interruption of the PD -L1 pathway represents an attractive strategy  for 
restoring tumor -specific T -cell immunity.  
Targeting the PD -L1 pathway with atezolizumab has demonstrated activity in patients 
with advanced malignancies who have failed standard -of-care therapies.  Objective 
responses have been observed across a broad  range of malignancies, including 
nonsmall cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) , urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, 
melanoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and 
sarcoma  (see the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for detailed efficacy results ). 
Cancer immunotherapy agents, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, have had a 
significant impact on the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies in recent 
years.  However, d espite the remarkable clinical efficacy of these therapies, it has 
become clear that they are not sufficiently active as monotherapy for many patients.  
A13–2.2 THE TIGIT P ATHWAY  
TIGIT is an immune inhibitory receptor that is a member of the immunoglobulin 
superfam ily (Yu et al. 2009 ).  TIGIT is expressed on the surface of activated T cell and 
natural killer ( NK) cell subsets and interacts with high affinity with CD155 (also known as 
PVR) (Yu  et al. 2009 ).  Genetic ablation of TIGIT in T cells in mice results in exa cerbated 
T-cell responses in nonclinical models of autoimmune and viral infections, demonstrating 
the role of TIGIT in inhibiting T -cell responses (Joller et al. 2011 ; Johnston et al. 2014 ).  
TIGIT expression is elevated in the tumor microenvironment in ma ny human tumors, is 
Appendix 1 3:  Study Details Specific to Atezo   Tira Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
227/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  concordantly expressed with other checkpoint immune -receptors such as PD -1 on the 
surface of T  cells, and is associated with impaired T -cell function and anti -tumor 
immunity (Johnston et al. 2014 ; Manieri  et al. 2017 ).  Activation of TI GIT on T cells and 
NK cells limits cellular proliferation, effector cytokine production, and killing of target 
tumor cells (Stanietsky  et al. 2009; Yu  et al. 2009; Johnston et al. 2014; Wang et al. 
2015 ; Manieri  et al. 2017 ). 
TIGIT is expressed in a wide variety of human tumors .  It is expressed in  most solid 
tumors, such as NSCLC, breast cancer, and melanoma , as well as in  hematological 
tumors, such as multiple myeloma ( MM) and non-Hodgkin  lymphoma ( NHL).  
Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis of T  cells isolated from fresh tumor samples 
revealed that TIGIT and PD -1 are also co -expressed on tumor -infiltrating T cells 
(Johnston et al. 2014;  Yadav  et al. 2016 ; Yang 2016 ; Guillerey at al. 2018 ).  TIGIT was 
expressed in  30%80% of tumor -infiltrating  CD4 T cells and in 50%80% of  tumor -
infiltrating  CD8 T cells ( Johnston  et al. 2014 ). 
Therefore, TIGIT is a potential target for therapeutic interventions that aim to restore the 
immune response against the tumor.  Agents that inhibit TIGIT’s interaction wit h PVR 
may inhibit an important source of tumor -associated immune suppression, thereby 
enhancing the activity of other immune -based therapies.  Nonclinical studies using 
genetically deficient mice and blocking antibodies have revealed a key role for TIGIT i n 
regulating T -cell responses in cancer.  Taken together, these data support the 
hypothesis that anti -TIGIT therapy may reactivate anti -tumor immunity and provide 
clinical benefits to patients with cancer.  
A13–2.3 COMBINATION TREATMEN T WITH ANTI PD-L1 AND ANTI-TIGIT 
AGENTS  
Durable clinical benefit is limited to a minority of patients treated with single -agent 
PD-L1/PD -1 inhibitors.  Therapies targeting the mechanisms of resistance to 
anti-PD-L1/PD -1 therapies are needed to improve outcomes in patients with solid 
cancers.  Resistance to PD -L1/PD -1 blockade may result in the expression of multiple 
co-inhibitory receptors on the surface of effector T cells.  Nonclinical tumor models have 
shown that TIGIT selectively suppressed the effector function of chronically sti mulated 
CD8 T cells, and that inhibiting both TIGIT and PD -L1/PD -1 resulted in superior efficacy 
compared with single -agent treatments (Johnston  et al. 2014).  Hence, targeting both 
TIGIT and PD -L1 with tiragolumab and atezolizumab , respectively, in patie nts, may 
enhance the efficacy of PD -L1/PD-1 blockade across different cancer types, including 
melanoma.

228/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A13–2.4 CLINICAL STUDIES OF TIRAGOLUMAB  AS A SINGLE AGENT 
OR IN COMBINATION WI TH ATEZOLIZUMAB  
Tiragolumab is currently under investigation in two ongoing clinical studies in patients 
with solid tumors (Studies GO30103 and GO40290) and in one clinical study in patients 
with in hematological malignancies (Study GO41036).  
A13–2.4.1 Study GO30103  
Study GO30103 is a first -in-human, open -label, multicenter, global, dose -
escalation/dose -expansion Phase I study .  It was  designed to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of tiragolumab as a single agent (Phase Ia) and in 
combination with atezolizumab (Phase Ib) in patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or 
metastatic incurable tumors, including urothelial cancer, renal cell cancer, NSCLC, head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), 
gastric cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and triple -negative breast cancer.  
As of the clinical  cutoff date of 2 December 2020 , a total of 236 patients had been 
enrolled in Study GO30103.  Forty -two patients were enrolled in the Phase Ia portion  of 
the study to receive single -agent tiragolumab, and 217 patients were enrolled in the 
Phase Ib portion of the study to receive tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab .  
The latter group included  23 patients who crossed over from the Phase Ia portion  of the 
study . 
The best observed response with tiragoluma b monotherapy in the Phase Ia portion was 
prolonged stable disease in 8 of 42 patients, with some patients, including 1 patient with 
CRC, experiencing a decrease in tumor size.  
In the Phase Ib portion, complete response was observed in 4 of 217 patients at  
tiragolumab dose levels of 400 mg (n   3/48) and 600 mg (n   1/104) in combination with 
1200 mg atezolizumab.  Partial response was observed in 27   of 217 patients at 
tiragolumab dose levels of 30 mg (n   2/13), 400  mg (n   6/48), and 600 mg (n   18/104) 
in combination with 1200 mg atezolizumab, including two patients who crossed over 
from the Phase Ia portion at the 600 mg dose level.  Stable disease was observed in 
53 of 217 patients at tiragolumab dose levels of 2  mg (n   1/8), 8  mg (n   3/12), 30 mg 
(n  2/13), 100 mg (n   3/8), 400 mg (n   12/48), 600 mg (n   25/104), and 1200 mg 
(n  7/24) in combination with 1200  mg atezolizumab, including 8 patients who crossed 
over from the Phase Ia portion of the study (2  patients at 8 mg, 1 patient at 30 mg, 
2 patients at 100 mg, and 3 patients at 400  mg). 
As of 2 December 2020 , safety data were available for 235 safety -evaluable patients in 
Study GO30103.  A total of 42 patients were treated in the Phase Ia portion with 
tiragolumab as a single agent (2 mg to 1200 mg), while 216 patients were treated in the 
Phase Ib portion with tiragolumab at dose levels of 2  mg to 1200 mg in combination with 
Appendix 1 3:  Study Details Specific to Atezo   Tira Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
229/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  atezolizumab at 1200 mg, including 23 patients who crossed over from the Phase Ia 
portion to the Phase  Ib portion.  
Tiragolumab was tolerated across all administered dose levels both as a single  agent 
and in combination with a tezolizumab.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not 
reached, and the maximum adminis tered dose was 1200 mg.  No dose -limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) or clear dose -related trends in the incidence of adverse events were  observed.  
Grade  3 adverse event s, reg ardless of attribution to the study drug(s), were reported in 
16 patients (38.1%) and 113 patients ( 52.3%) in the Phase Ia and Phase  Ib portions, 
respectively.  There were 14 reported deaths in the Phase Ia portion of the study, 
including 12 deaths due to malignant neoplasm progression, 1 death due to 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the context of progressive disease, and 1 death due to 
hepatic failure.  The death due to hepatic failure was considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug.  One hun dred eighteen deaths were reported in the Phase Ib 
portion of the study .  This included 111  deaths due to progressive disease ( 31 cases 
were reported as adverse event s during the adverse event  reporting period and coded 
as malignant neoplasm progression or  neoplasm malignant), 2 deaths due to pulmonary 
embolism, 1  death due to esophageal hemorrhage, 1 death due to sepsis, 1 death due 
to septic shock, 1 death due to COVID -19, and 1 death due to upper airway obstruction.  
Treatment -related serious adverse eve nts were reported in 1 patient in the Phase Ia 
portion (hepatic failure) and in 10 patients (4. 6%) in the Phase Ib portion.  No patient 
discontinued study treatment due to adverse event s in the Phase Ia portion of Study 
GO30103.  Adverse event s leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 
12 patients in the Phase Ib portion of the study, with a Grade 4 cardiac tamponade, a 
Grade 4 pneumonitis, and one event of Grade 2 arthralgia considered by the investigator 
to be related to the study  drug(s).  Adverse events of special interest were reported in 
5 patients (11.9%) in the Phase Ia portion and 82 patients (38. 0%) in the Phase Ib 
portion of the study.  
Overall, tiragolumab as a single agent or in combination with atezolizumab has been 
well tolerated, adverse events have been manageable, and the safety profile has been 
observed to be consistent across different solid tumor indications.  
A13–2.4.2 Study GO40290  
Study GO40290 is a Phase II, randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled study of 
tiragolumab plu s atezolizumab compared with placebo plus atezolizumab in patients with 
previously untreated locally advanced unresectable or metastatic PD -L1positive 
NSCLC (defined as tumor proportion score [TPS]  1%). 
As of the primary clinical cutoff date of 30 June 2019, 135  patients with a PD -L1 TPS 
 1% were  included in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population and  were randomly assigned to 
receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (n   67) or placebo plus atezolizumab (n   68).  
Appendix 1 3:  Study Details Specific to Atezo   Tira Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
230/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  As of the primary analysis, 47.8% of patient s in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group 
versus  27.9% of patients in the placebo plus atezolizumab group were still receiving 
study treatment in the ITT population.  In the TPS   50% population, 65.5% of patients in 
the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group versus  24.1% of patients in the placebo plus 
atezolizumab group were still receiving study treatment.  
In all randomized patients,  the combination of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab improved 
the co -primary endpoints of investigator -assessed ORR and progression -free survival 
(PFS) compared with placebo plus atezolizumab, with median follow -up of 5.9 months.  
ORR for tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was 31.3% (95%  CI: 19.5, 43.2) compared with 
placebo plus atezolizumab which was 16.2% (95%  CI: 6.7, 25.7).  Investigator -assessed 
median PFS for tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.2 months, 
not reached) compared to placebo plus atezolizumab which was 3.6 months (95% CI: 
2.7 months, 4.4 months), with a stratified hazard ratio ( HR) of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.90).  
Investigator -assessed PFS was improved in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group 
over the placebo plus atezolizumab group (unstratified HR   0.33; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.72;  
median PFS not reached vs. 3.9 months, respectively).  
As of 2 December 2020, 67 safety -evaluable patients in the tiragolumab plus 
atezolizumab arm in Study GO40290 were treated with a median of 8 doses of 
tiragolumab and atezolizumab (range: 1 38) for a median of 5.0 months 
(range:  0.0326.0).  In the placebo plus atezolizumab arm, 68 safety -evaluable patients 
were treated with a median of 5 doses of placebo and atezolizumab (range: 1 37) for a 
median of 2.8  months (range: 0.03 26.3).  
As of 30 June 2020 , in the Phase II randomized, placebo -controlled  Study GO40290, 
a total of 135  safety -evaluable patients were administered either tiragolumab (600 mg 
recommended Phase II/III dose) in combination with atezolizumab or placebo in 
combination with atezolizumab.   The safety profile of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was 
similar to that of placebo plus atezolizumab - for all -grade adverse event s 
(98.5%  vs. 97.1%), Grade   3 adverse event s (53.7% vs. 50.0%), serious adverse 
event s (47.8% vs. 39.7%), and adverse event s leading to treatment discontinuation 
(13.4%  vs. 11.8%).  Adverse  events of special interest  were reported in 58.2% of 
patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab arm and in 32.4% of patients in the 
placebo plus atezolizumab arm.  One death due to Epstei n-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation 
and possible secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was reported in this 
study, which was considered by the investigator to be related to the study drugs.  
Overall, tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab has  been well tolerated, adverse 
events have been manageable, and t he safety profile seems to be consistent as 
reported across different solid tumor indications.

A13–2.5 BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT  
The preliminary safety and efficacy data from the ongoing studies of tiragolumab as a 
single agent or in combination with atezolizumab across different solid tumor indications 
including melanoma, and hematologic m alignancies support a favorable benefit risk 
profile for tiragolumab.  This favorable benefit risk profile, the potential for TIGIT as a 
target for therapeutic intervention in melanoma , and the significant unmet medical need 
in this indication are key reas ons for the current study.  
To evaluate overlapping toxicities of the experimental treatments in the neoadjuvant 
setting (refer to Section A13–5.1.3  for details) , a minimum of 6  patients in the 
Atezo   Tira arm must complete a safety evaluation before additional patients can be 
enrolled in that arm (refer to Section  3.1.3  for details).

A13–3 RATIONALE FOR DOSE A ND SCHEDULE  FOR 
ATEZO   TIRA ARM 
A13–3.1 RATIONALE FOR ATEZOL IZUMAB DOSE AND SCHE DULE 
Atezolizumab will be administered at a fixed dose  of 1200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) 
(1200 mg on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle), which is an approved dosage for 
atezolizumab.  
A13–3.2 RATIONALE FOR T IRAGOLUMAB  DOSE AND SCHEDULE  
Tiragolumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 600 mg IV Q3W (600 mg on Day  1 of 
each 21 -day cycle).  
The fixed dose of 600 mg IV Q3W was selected on the basis of  available clinical 
pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data from the combined Phase Ia/Phase Ib Study 
GO30103, with single -agent tiragolumab or tiragolumab in combination with 
atezolizumab.  In the Phase Ia portion of the study with tiragolumab as a sing le agent, 
the MTD was not reached, and no DLTs were observed in dose -escalation.  As of the 
clinical cutoff date, anti -drug antibodies to tiragolumab were rare in the Phase Ia or 
Phase Ib portions across all dose levels.  Complete occupancy of peripheral T IGIT 
receptors on CD4+, CD8+, and NK cells was observed beginning at 30 mg of tiragolumab 
in both Phase Ia and Phase Ib portions of the study and remained sustained at all higher 
doses (unpublished Roche data on file).

In general, investigators should manage a patient's care (including preexisting 
conditions) with supportive therapies other than those defined as cautionary or 
prohibited therapies as clinically  indicated, per local standa rd practice.  Patients who 
experience infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-receptor antagonists (e.g., 
famotidine, cimetidine), or equivalent medications per local standard practi ce.  Serious 
infusion -associated  events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should 
be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g.,  supplementa l oxygen 
and 2-adrenergic agonists;  refer to Appendix  8 for details ). 
A13–4.2.2 Cautionary Therapy for Atezo   Tira Arm 
A13–4.2.2.1 Corticosteroids, Immunosuppressive M edications, and 
Tumor Necrosis Factor - Inhibitors  
Systemic corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications,  and tumor necrosis factor - 
(TNF -) inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment 
with atezolizum ab and /or tiragolumab.  Therefore, in situations in which systemic 
Appendix 1 3:  Study Details Specific to Atezo   Tira Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
237/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications,  or TNF - inhibitors would be routinely 
administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered.  If the 
alternatives are n ot feasible, systemic corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications,  
and TNF - inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Systemic corticosteroids  or immunosuppressive medications, are recommended, at the 
discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events when 
associated with atezolizumab and /or tiragolumab therapy (refer to Appendix  9 for 
details) . 
A13–4.2.2.2 Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug -drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer 
(see Section A13–4.2.3 ) may be used during the study at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
A13–4.2.3 Prohibited Therapy for Atezo   Tira Arm 
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited for 
various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent 
(see Section  4.4), and during study treatment until surgery, or if earlier, until disease 
progression is documented and the patient has discontinued study treatment.  
 Investigational thera py is prohibited withi n 28 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment and during study treatment.  
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g.,  FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment, during treatment with atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab, 
and for 5  months after the final dose of atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab.  
 Systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferons and 
interleukin -2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 half -lives of the drug (whichever is 
longer) prior to initiat ion of study treatment and during study treatment because 
these agents could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions when 
given in combination with atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab.

238/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A13–4.3 CONTRACEPTION REQUIR EMENTS FOR  ATEZO   TIRA ARM  
Contraception requirements for men and women in the Atezo   Tira arm are outlined 
below:  
 For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:  
Women must remain a bstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate 
of  1% per year during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final 
dose of atezolizumab and for 90 days  after the final dose of tiragolumab.  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing po tential if she is postmenarcheal, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not 
permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, 
and/o r uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator 
(e.g.,  Müllerian agenesis).  The definition of childbearing potential may be 
adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.  
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of  1% per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation  to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized acceptable 
methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will 
be described in the local Informed Consent Form.  
 For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from hete rosexual intercourse) or 
use a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:  
With a female partner of childbearing potential or pregnant female partner, men 
must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for  
90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab.  Men must refrain from donating 
sperm during this same period.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of  the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing drug 
exposure.  If  required per local guidelines or regulations, information about the 
reliabili ty of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.

239/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A13–5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  FOR ATEZO   TIRA ARM  
A13–5.1 SAFETY PLAN FOR ATEZ O  TIRA ARM  
The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with 
atezolizumab and tiragolumab in completed and ongoing studies.  The anticipated 
important safety risks are outlined below (see Sections A13–5.1.1 , A13–5.1.2 , and A13–
5.1.3 ).  Guidelines for management of patients who experience specific adverse events 
are provided in Section A13–5.1.4  and Appendix  9. 
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, 
including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of 
patients du ring the study.   Because of the potential for overlapping toxicities for 
atezolizumab and tiragolumab, special caution will be taken by performing a planned 
safety evaluation phase for patients randomized to this arm (see  Section  3.1.3 ). 
Administration of atezolizumab and tiragolumab will be performed in a monitored setting 
in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate e quipment and 
medicine to manage potentially serious reactions.  Adverse events will be reported as 
described in Sections 5.25.6. 
A13–5.1.1 Risks Associated with Atezolizumab  
Atezolizumab has been associa ted with risks such as the following:  IRRs and 
immune -mediated  hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, 
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, Guillain -Barré  
syndrome, myasthenic syndrome or myasthen ia gravis, facial paresis, myelitis, 
meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, pericardial disorders, nephritis, myositis, and severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs).  In addition, i mmune -mediated reactions may 
involve any organ system and lead to HLH.  Refer to Appendix  9 of the protocol and 
Section  6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a detailed description of 
anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab.  
A13–5.1.2 Risks Associated with Tiragolumab  
Infusion -related reactions and immune -mediated hepatitis are  identified risk s of 
tiragolumab.  Lymphopenia is a potential risk with tiragolumab.  Although  clinical 
evaluation of tiragolumab is limit ed and not all risks are known, as an antagonist of 
TIGIT, tiragolumab is anticipated to enhance T -cell and NK -cell proliferation, survival, 
and function.  Therefore, tiragolumab may increase the risk of autoimmune inflammation 
(also described as immune -mediated adverse events).   
Refer to Appendix  9 of the protocol and Section 6 of  the Tiragolumab Investigator’s 
Brochure for  a detailed description of anticipated safety risks of tiragolumab . 
Appendix 1 3:  Study Details Specific to Atezo   Tira Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
240/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A13–5.1.2.1 Infusion -Related Reactions  
Because tiragolumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody and targets immune cells, 
IRRs associated with hypersensitivity reactions  and/or  target -mediated cytokine -release 
may occur.  Clinical signs and symptoms of such reactions may include rigors, chills, 
wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever.  
IRRs have been reported in patients treated with tiragolumab, with or without 
atezolizumab.  The majo rity of events were mild to moderate and manageable.  
To minimize the risk and sequelae of IRRs, the initial dose of tiragolumab will be 
administered over 60 minutes followed by a 60 -minute observation period.  Subsequent 
infusions and observation times may  be shortened if the preceding infusion was  well 
tolerated.  All infusions will be administered in an appropriate medical setting.  
Refer to Section  A13–4.1.2  for detailed guidance on administration of tiragolumab in this 
study.  Please see Appendix  8 for guidance on anaphylaxis precautions and  Table  A13-
5 for guidance on the management of IRRs.  
A13–5.1.2.2 Immune -Mediated Hepatitis  
The use of tiragolumab to block the immune inhibitory receptor TIGIT serves to increase 
a baseline T -cell and NK -cell immune response, especially in combination with other 
checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., atezolizumab).  A disruption in the functioning of imm une 
checkpoint molecules may lead to imbalances in immunologic tolerance that results in 
an unchecked immune response, including immune -mediated hepatitis.  
Refer to Appendix  9 for guidance on the management of immune -mediated hepatitis.  
A13–5.1.2.3 Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
Nonclinical models have suggested a role of TIGIT signaling interruption in 
autoimmunity.  In a knockout mode l (TIGIT/), loss of TIGIT signaling resulted in 
hyperproliferative T -cell responses and exacerbation of experimental autoimmune 
encephalitis (EAE).  TIGIT / and wild -type B6 mice were immunized with myelin 
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide in an EAE using suboptimal doses.  In contrast to 
the wild -type B6 mice, the majority of the TIGIT / mice developed severe EAE (Joller et 
al. 2011).  
Clinical experience with therapeutics intended to enhance anti -tumor T -cell responses 
has demonstrated that development of autoimmune inflammatory conditions is a general 
risk and may therefore be considered a potential risk of tiragolumab.  Such 
immune -mediated adverse events have been described for virtually all organ systems 
and include, but are not limited t o, colitis, pneumonitis, endocrinopath ies, ocular toxicity, 
Appendix 1 3:  Study Details Specific to Atezo   Tira Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
241/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  pancreatic toxicity, neurologic toxicity, cardiac toxicity , nephritis, myositis,  and severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions . 
Patients with a history of autoimmune disease will be excluded from this st udy 
(see Section  4.1.2 ). 
In this study, immune -mediated adverse events will be considered adverse events of 
special interest and will be c aptured accordingly (see Section A13–5.2 for the list of 
adverse events of special interest and Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  
Suggested management guidelines for individual  suspected immune -mediated adverse 
events are provided in Appendix  9. 
A13–5.1.2.4 Lymphopenia  
The IgG1 backbone of tiragolumab with intact Fc -effector function  may lead to  
ADCC -mediated reduction in lymphocyte count.  Lymphopenia is a potential risk with 
tiragolumab .  Transient decreases in  lymphocyte count without clinical sequelae have 
been observed in patients treated with tiragolumab, with or without atezolizumab . 
Patients with a lymphocyte count  0.5   109/L (500/L) will be excluded from the study  
(see Section  4.1.1 ), and c omplete blood counts will be monitored regularly during  the 
study  (see Appendix A13–6). 
A13–5.1.2.5 Embryofetal Toxicity  
Embryofetal toxicity is a potential risk with tiragolumab.  Administration of tiragolumab is 
expected to have ad verse effects on pregnancy based on the expression of TIGIT on 
decidual NK and CD8  T cells (Powell et al. 2017; van der Zwan et al. 2018; 
Vento -Tormo et al. 2018), and the expected role of these cells in the recognition and 
response to foreign fetal, placental, and viral antigens at the maternal -fetal interface as 
well as maintenance of maternal -fetal tolerance.  No reproductive or teratogenicity 
studies in animals have been conducted with tiragolumab.  There are no clinical studies 
of tiragolumab in p regnant women.  Tiragolumab should not be administered to pregnant 
women.  
Refer to Section 6 of the Tiragolumab Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description 
of embryofetal toxicity.  
A13–5.1.3 Risks Associated with Combination Use of Atezolizumab and 
Tiragoluma b 
Based on results from clinical data with tiragolumab and atezolizumab, there are known 
and potential overlapping toxicities in patients treated with tiragolumab plus 
atezolizumab.  Because the expected pharmacologic activity of these two molecules is 
Appendix 1 3:  Study Details Specific to Atezo   Tira Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
242/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  to increase adaptive T -cell immune responses, there is the possibility of heightened 
immune responses.  
Refer to Section 6 of the Tiragolumab Investigator's Brochure for a list of identified risks 
associated with tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab.  Based on the 
mechanism of action of tiragolumab and atezolizumab, additional immune -mediated 
adverse events are potential overlapping toxicities associated with combination use of 
tiragolumab plus atezolizumab.  
Based on clinical experience to date, it is a nticipated that immune -mediated adverse 
events following treatment with tiragolumab and atezolizumab will be amenable to 
monitoring and manageable in the setting of this combination study.  The extensive 
experience with immune CPIs to date has been incorpo rated into the design and safety 
management plan (see Section  5.1) in order to reduce the potential risks to participatin g 
patients.  Patients with a history of autoimmune disease will be excluded from this study 
(see Section  4.1.2 ).  Patients  previously treated with approved or experimental CIT will 
also be excluded from participation in Cohort 1.   Owing to the risks of active viral 
infection and viral reactivation, patients with active infection (including, but not limited to, 
HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, known and/or suspected chronic active EBV infection, or 
tuberculosis) and/or patients with recent severe infections will be excluded from this 
study (see Section s 4.1.1  and 4.1.2 ). 
A13–5.1.4 Management of Patient s Who Experience S pecific Adverse 
Events in the Atezo   Tira Arm 
A13–5.1.4.1 Dose Modifications  
There will be no dose modifications for atezolizumab or tiragolumab in this study.  
A13–5.1.4.2 Treatment Interruption for Toxicities  
Atezolizumab and tiragolumab treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients 
experiencing toxicity considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are 
initiated for treatment of the toxicity, they must be tapered over  1 month to the 
equivalent of  10 mg/day oral prednison e before study treatment can be resumed , if 
warranted.  In the neoadjuvant setting , the study treatment is limited to a pre -surgery 
window of 6 weeks.  Treatment during this period should not be interrupted , unless a 
patient experiences toxicity.  If toxic ity meets criteria for interrupting/withholding 
atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab , atezolizumab and tiragolumab  should be 
interrupted/withheld.   After resolution of the toxicity, subsequent treatment cycles should 
only be considered if the benefit/risk profi le is acceptable and if the surgery can be 
conducted within 2 weeks of the planned date.  Otherwise, subsequent treatment cycles 
should be omitted to allow the patient to proceed directly to surgery without further delay . 
Appendix 1 3:  Study Details Specific to Atezo   Tira Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
243/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  On the basis of the available char acterization of mechanism of action, tiragolumab may 
cause adverse events similar to, but independent of, atezolizumab.  Tiragolumab may 
also exacerbate the frequency or severity of atezolizumab -related adverse events or 
may have non -overlapping toxicities  with atezolizumab.  Because these scenarios may 
not be distinguishable from each other in the clinical setting, adverse events should 
generally be attributed to both agents, and dose interruptions or treatment 
discontinuation in response to adverse events  should be applied to both tiragolumab and 
atezolizumab.  If atezolizumab is withheld  or discontinued, tiragolumab should also be 
withheld or discontinued.  If tiragolumab is withheld  or discontinued, atezolizumab 
should also be withheld  or discontinued.  
A13–5.1.5 Management Guidelines for Adverse Events  
Guidelines for the management of patients who experience specific adverse events are 
provided in  Table  A13-4, Table  A13-5, and Appendix  9. 
For cases in which management guidelines are not covered in Appendix  9, patients 
should be managed and treatments should be withheld or discontinued as deemed 
appropriate by the investigator according to best medical judgment.

244/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A13–5.1.5.1 Infusion -Related Reactions  
No premedication is indicated for the administration of the Day 1, Cycle 1 infusion of 
tiragolumab or atezolizumab.  However, patients who exper ience an IRR with the Day 1, 
Cycle 1 infusion of tiragolumab or atezolizumab may receive premedication with 
antihistamines, antipyretic medication, or analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for 
subsequent infusions.  Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in treati ng atezolizumab -
associated IRRs because of its potential for causing agranulocytosis.  
IRRs are known to occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have 
been reported with tiragolumab and atezolizumab.  These reactions, which are thought 
to be due to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators, occur within 24 hours 
of tiragolumab or atezolizumab administration and are generally mild to moderate in 
severity.  Guidelines for medical management of IRRs during Cycle 1 are provided in 
Table  A13-5.  For  subsequent cycles, IRRs should be managed according to institutional 
guidelines.  
Table A13-5 Management Guidelines for Infusion -Related Reactions  
Event  Management  
IRR, Grade 1   Reduce infusion rate to half the rate being given at the time of 
event onset.  
 After the event has resolved, the investigator should wait for 
30 minutes while delivering the infusion at the reduced rate. 
 If the infusion is tolerated at the reduced rate for 30 minutes after 
symptoms have resolved, the infusion rate may be increased to 
the original rate.  
IRR, Grade 2   Interrupt infusion.  
 Administer aggressive symptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV 
antihistamine, antipyretic medication, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, oxygen, IV fluids).  
 After symptoms have resolved to baseline, resume infusion at half 
the rate being given at the time of event onset.  
 For subsequent infusions, consider administration of oral 
premedication with antihistamines, antipyretic medications, and/or 
analgesics and monitor closely for IRRs.  
IRR, Grade 3 or 4   Stop infusion.  
 Administer aggressive symptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV 
antihistamine, antipyretic medication, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, oxygen, IV fluids).  
 Permanently discontinue tiragolumab and atezolizumab and 
contact the Medical Monitor. a 
IRR   infusion -related reaction.

A13–5.2 ADVERSE EVENTS OF SP ECIAL INTEREST FOR T HE 
ATEZO   TIRA ARM (IMMEDIATELY REPORT ABLE 
TO THE SPONSOR)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than  24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section  5.2.3  for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for the 
Atezo   Tira arm are as follows:  
 Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's Law 
(see Section  5.3.5.7 ) 
 Suspected transmission o f an infectious agent by the study treatment, as defined 
below:  
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A tran smission of an infectious agent may be

A13–5.3 REPORTING REQUIREMEN TS FOR PREGNANCIES I N THE 
ATEZO   TIRA ARM 
A13–5.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed  through the Informed Consent 
Form  to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or 
within 5 months after the final dose of atezolizumab or within 90 days  after the final dose 
of tiragolumab.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be compl eted 
and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and e -mailing the form 
using the fax number or e -mail address provided to investigators.  Pregnancy  should not 
be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study 
treatment and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the 
possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until c onclusion 
of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an 
event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse E vent eCRF.  In 
addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when 
updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When permitted 
by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health Information 
would need to be signed by one or both parents (as per local regulations) to allow for 
follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the  infant's health status at 
birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form.  In addition, the 
Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant's health status at 6 and 
12 months after birth.  
A13–5.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients  
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab.  The investigator should repor t the 
pregnancy on the  paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit the form to 
the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and e -mailing the form using the fax number 
or e-mail address provided to investigators.  Attempts should be made to collect and 
report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male 
patient exposed to study treatment.  When permitted by the site, the preg nant partner 
would need to sign an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health 
Appendix 1 3:  Study Details Specific to Atezo   Tira Arm 
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
247/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy.  If the authorization has been 
signed, the investigator should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form with 
additional  information on the pregnant partner and the course and outcome of the 
pregnancy as it becomes available.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When permitted 
by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health Information 
would need to be signed by one or both parents (as per local regulations) to allo w for 
follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's health status at 
birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form.  In addition, the 
Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant's health status at 6 and 
12 months after birth.  
An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide 
information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, to 
support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or 
obstetrician.  
A13–5.3.3 Abortions  
A spontaneous  abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as  the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and reported to the Spon sor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section  5.4.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion w as performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of  the event; see  Section  5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.  
All abortions should be reported as p regnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
A13–5.3.4 Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study 
treatment or the female partner of a male patient exposed to  study treatment should be 
classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section  5.2.2 ).

252/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  a If a visit is precluded because of a holiday, vacation, or other circumstance, it can occur outside of the specified window.  
b Regardless of whether they complete the study drug treatment period or discontinue study drug prematurely, patients who pro ceed to surgery  
will return to the clinic for a treatment completion/ discontinuation  visit 6 weeks after surgery and patients who do not proceed to surgery  will 
return to the clinic for a treatment completion/ discontinuation visit not more than 30 days aft er the final dose of study treatment.  
c Patients who proceed to surgery will have the surgery follow -up 6 months after surgery .  
d Assessment may be performed within 24 hours prior to dosing during the treatment period.  
e The disease status assessments at Week 13 should include a mandatory CT scan.  
f After initiation of study treatment, all  adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new 
systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first, an d serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will continue to be 
reported until 135 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  After 
this period, all dea ths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  In addition, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of 
any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior exposure to study treatment (see Section 5.6).  For details on reporting all 
treatment -related non -serious adverse events that lead to surgical delay, see Section  5.6.  The investigator should follow each adverse event 
until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the 
patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to stud y treatment or trial -
related procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
g Regardless of  whether they complete the study drug treatment period or discontinue study drug prematurely, patients who proceed to surgery  
will have their first long-term follow -up visit 3 months after surgery and patients who do not proceed to surgery  will have their first long-term 
follow -up visit 3 months after the final dose of study treatment.  Information on follow -up and new anti -cancer therapy (including targeted therapy 
and immunotherapy) will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or cl inic visits approximately every 3 months until death 
(unless the patient withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study).   If a patient requests to be withdrawn from follow -up, this request 
must be documented in the source documents and signed by th e investigator.  If a patient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a 
public information source (e.g., county records) to obtain information about survival status only.  For an experimental arm i n which all patients 
discontinued treatment and p assed the safety follow -up window, as well as approximately 80% of patients discontinued the study, the Sponsor 
may conclude the arm (the remaining ~20% of patients will be discontinued from the study).  
h Laboratory tests must be performed within 72 hours prior to dosing during  the treatment period.   If screening laboratory assessments were 
performed within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1, they do not have to be repeated.  
i At the pre -surgery visit, adrenocorticotropic hormone , cortisol, S100, and erythr ocyte sedimentation rate will be included in the chemistry panel.  
j This is only applicable if elevated levels of cardiac enzymes were detected in previous assessments.

A14–1.1 BACKGROUND ON RO7247 669 
RO7247669 is a novel, Fc -silent IgG1 -based bispecific antibody (bsAb) in 1   1 format 
that incorporates monovalent binding to two immune checkpoint proteins:  PD-1 and 
LAG-3.  RO7247669 is designed to target dysfunctional tumor antigen -specific 
T lymphocytes expressing PD -1 and LAG -3 to establish or re -establish an effective 
anti-tumor immune response in cancer patients.  This may result in improved therapeutic 
responses over currently available therapies.  In addition, RO7247669  is engineered to 
prevent binding to Fc gamma receptors, thus potentially avoiding tumor -associated 
macrophage resistance mechanisms.  Such mechanisms have been observed with 
IgG4 -based anti PD-1 antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab (Arlauckas e t 
al. 2017).  Clinical evaluation of RO7247669 is ongoing in a first -in-human, dose -finding 
study (Study NP41300), as a single agent in cancer patients with and without prior CPI 
exposure.   
Refer to the RO7247669 Investigator’s Brochure for details on non clinical and  other 
planned and ongoing  clinical studies.  
A14–1.2 BACKGROUND ON TIRAGO LUMAB 
Tiragolumab is a fully human IgG1/kappa monoclonal antibody that binds TIGIT and 
prevents its interaction with CD155 (also known as poliovirus receptor [PVR]).  
Therapeutic blockade of TIGIT by tiragolumab represents an attractive strategy for 
cancer therapy and is expected to enhance the magnitude and quality of tumor -specific 
T-cell responses.  This may result in improved meaningful anti -tumor activity when 
tiragolumab is u sed in combination with other cancer immunotherapies and administered 
with chemotherapy.  The available nonclinical and clinical data provide a strong rationale 
for evaluating the potential clinical benefit of tiragolumab in cancer patients.  
Refer to the T iragolumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinical and clinical 
studies.  
A14–2 RATIONALE FOR RO7247 669 2100 mg  TIRA ARM 
A14–2.1 TARGETING THE PD -1 AND LAG -3 ANTIGENS  
Cancer immunotherapy agents, particularly immune CPIs, have had a significant impact 
on the  treatment of patients with advanced malignancies in recent years.  However, 
despite the remarkable clinical efficacy of these therapies, additional treatment options 
targeting immune checkpoints are needed, because the majority of patients eventually 
progress after an initial response or fail to respond to the PD -1/PD-L1 checkpoint 
blockade.  This is believed to be mainly due to primary or secondary resistance 
Appendix 1 4:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm  (Cohorts 1 and 2)

261/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  mechanisms, immunosuppressive activity of myeloid -derived suppressor cells and/or 
T-regulatory ce lls (Sharma et al. 2017).  
To overcome resistance mechanisms, additional treatment options and multiple 
combinations with anti PD-L1 are being assessed.  One potential reason for resistance 
to antiPD-L1 therapy is the upregulation of alternative immune che ckpoints with 
non-redundant regulatory functions (Sharma et al. 2017).  LAG -3 is one such alternative 
immune checkpoint.  Structurally similar to CD4, LAG -3 is a member of the Ig 
superfamily.  LAG-3 is expressed on activated effector T cells and is constit utively 
expressed on T-regulatory cells and natural killer ( NK) cells.  The expression of both 
PD-1 and LAG -3 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlates with the degree of 
impairment of effector functions, which is associated with poor prognosis 
(Matsuzaki  et al. 2010; Baitsch et al. 2011; Thommen et al. 2015).  Hence, LAG-3 is a 
marker of T -cell dysfunctionality.  LAG -3 also regulates T -cell functions, presumably 
including the function of T-regulatory cells .  In chronic infections and cancer, LAG -3, 
together with PD -1, contributes to T -cellacquired dysfunctionality and to the inability of 
T cells to mount an effective/protective immune response upon interaction with the 
LAG-3 ligand, MHC -II. 
The interaction of LAG -3 with MHC -II inhibits T -cell proliferation, activation, cytolytic 
function, and proinflammatory cytokine production (Goldberg and Drake 2011).  The 
effect of LAG -3 expression on T -regulatory cells is controversial.  An early report 
concluded that LAG -3 promotes T-regulatory cell -media ted immune suppression  
(Camisaschi et al. 2010).  However, a more recent report from the same authors found 
that LAG -3 limits T-regulatory cell -mediated immune suppression (Zhang et al. 2017).  
Expression of LAG -3 has been reported across various tumor type s, including breast 
cancer, ovarian cancer, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, renal cell 
cancer (RCC), prostate cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  In patients with 
these tumor types, LAG -3 is associated with poor prognosis (Matsuzaki et al. 2010; 
Baitsch et al. 2011; Thommen et al. 2015; He et al. 2016; Norstrom et al. 2016).  Clinical 
evaluation of anti LAG-3 agents, as a single -agent and in combination with other CPIs, 
is ongoing in several early phase studies in patients with advanced solid tumors 
(Long  et al. 2018).  Preliminary data demonstrate that anti LAG-3 therapy is well 
tolerated, both as a single agent and in combination with anti PD-1 therapies, and the 
safety profiles were consistent with those of other CPIs (Asciert o et al. 2017; 
Hong  et al. 2018; Stratton  et al. 2018).  RO7247669 therefore has the potential to be a 
therapeutic option for patients with melanoma.  
Resistance to PD -L1/PD -1 blockade may result in the expression of multiple co -inhibitory 
immune checkpoint s on the surface of effector T cells.  LAG -3 is frequently 
co-expressed with PD -1 on TILs, and dual blockade of PD -1 and LAG -3 enhances CD8 
Appendix 1 4:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm  (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
262/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  T-cell effector function and potentiates anti -tumor immunity in nonclinical models.  
Blockade of these two receptor s in mice with colon, fibrosarcoma, or ovarian tumors 
resulted in tumor remission in approximately 80% of animals compared with 10% to 40% 
with blockade of either receptor using a single agent (Woo et al. 2012; Huang et al. 
2015).  TILs from patients with ovarian cancer showed that antigen -specific CD8 T cells 
co-expressing PD -1 and LAG -3 exhibited greater impairment in their ability to respond to 
cognate antigen stimulation compared with CD8 T cells that expressed one checkpoint 
molecule (Matsuzaki et al . 2010).  In patients with NSCLC, overexpression of LAG -3 on 
TILs correlated with PD -1/PD -L1 expression and was linked to higher risk of recurrence 
and poor survival outcomes (He et al. 2017).  
A14–2.2 THE TIGIT PATHWAY  
TIGIT is an immune inhibitory receptor that i s a member of the immunoglobulin 
superfamily (Yu et al. 2009 ).  TIGIT is expressed on the surface of activated T cell and 
NK cell subsets and interacts with high affinity with CD155 (also known as PVR) 
(Yu et al. 2009 ).  Genetic ablation of TIGIT in T cell s in mice results in exacerbated 
T-cell responses in nonclinical models of autoimmune and viral infections, demonstrating 
the role of TIGIT in inhibiting T -cell responses (Joller et al. 2011 ; Johnston et al. 2014 ).  
TIGIT expression is elevated in the tumo r microenvironment in many human tumors, is 
concordantly expressed with other checkpoint immune -receptors such as PD -1 on the 
surface of T  cells, and is associated with impaired T -cell function and anti -tumor 
immunity (Johnston et al. 2014 ; Manieri  et al. 2017 ).  Activation of TIGIT on T cells and 
NK cells limits cellular proliferation, effector cytokine production, and killing of target 
tumor cells (Stanietsky  et al. 2009; Yu  et al. 2009; Johnston et al. 2014; Wang et al. 
2015 ; Manieri  et al. 2017 ). 
TIGIT is expressed in a wide variety of human tumors.  It is expressed in most solid 
tumors, such as NSCLC, breast cancer, and melanoma, as well as in hematological 
tumors, such as multiple myeloma (MM) and non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).  
Fluorescence activated c ell sorting analysis of T cells isolated from fresh tumor samples 
revealed that TIGIT and PD -1 are also co -expressed on tumor -infiltrating T cells 
(Johnston et al. 2014; Yadav  et al. 2016 ; Yang 2016 ; Guillerey et al. 2018 ).  TIGIT was 
expressed in 30% 80% of tumor -infiltrating  CD4 T cells and in 50% 80% of 
tumor -infiltrating  CD8 T cells (Johnston  et al. 2014).  
Therefore, TIGIT is a potential target for therapeutic interventions that aim to restore the 
immune response against the tumor.  Agents that inhibi t TIGIT’s interaction with PVR 
may inhibit an important source of tumor -associated immune suppression, thereby 
enhancing the activity of other immune -based therapies.  Nonclinical studies using 
genetically deficient mice and blocking antibodies have reveal ed a key role for TIGIT in 
regulating T -cell responses in cancer.  Taken together, these data support the 
Appendix 1 4:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm  (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
263/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  hypothesis that anti -TIGIT therapy may reactivate anti -tumor immunity and provide 
clinical benefits to patients with cancer.  
A14–2.3 COMBINATION TREATMEN T WITH ANTIPD-1/ANTILAG-3 
AND ANTI-TIGIT AGENTS  
Durable clinical benefit is limited to a minority of patients treated with single -agent 
PD-L1/PD -1 inhibitors.  Therapies targeting the mechanisms of resistance to 
anti-PD-L1/PD -1 therapies are needed to improve  outcomes in patients with solid 
cancers.  Resistance to PD -L1/PD -1 blockade may result in the expression of multiple 
co-inhibitory receptors on the surface of effector T cells including TIGIT and LAG -3.  
Nonclinical tumor models have shown that TIGIT sele ctively suppressed the effector 
function of chronically stimulated CD8 T cells, and that inhibiting both TIGIT and 
PD-L1/PD -1 resulted in superior efficacy compared with single -agent treatments 
(Johnston  et al. 2014).  Similarly, in -vivo proof -of-concept studies using different tumor 
mouse models have shown PD1 -LAG-3 bsAbs to be superior in controlling tumor growth 
and pr omoting tumor eradication when compared with anti-PD-1 antibodies as 
monotherapy.  Hence, targeting PD -1/LAG -3 and TIGIT with RO7247669 and 
tiragolumab, respectively, may enhance the efficacy of PD -L1/PD -1 blockade across 
different cancer types, including melanoma.  
A14–2.4 CLINICAL STUDIES  OF AGENTS TARGETING  THE PD-1 AND 
LAG-3 PATHWAYS  
Clinical data are available for early - and late -phase studies that evaluated the safety, 
tolerability, and preliminary anti -tumor activity of agents that target both the PD -1 and 
LAG-3 pathways.  Evidence of clinical activity has been reported in some of these 
studies.  Overall, adverse events have been manageable to date, and the safety profiles 
appear similar to those of single -agent CPIs.  
An ongoing Phase I/IIa study is evaluating  the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of 
combination treatment with the anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab and the 
antiLAG-3 monoclonal antibody relatlimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.  
Preliminary data suggest that the combinat ion of nivolumab and relatlimab may have an 
increased benefit compared with single -agent anti PD-1.  In a cohort of patients who 
had advanced melanoma who were previously treated with anti PD-1/PD -L1 agents, the 
objective response rate (ORR) was 11.5% (n   61) with a disease control rate of 49%.  
The antiPD-1/PD -L1 treatment combination had an acceptable safety profile that was  
similar to the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy (Ascierto et al. 2017).  
Relativity -047 is a phase III study evaluating t he combination of nivolumab 
(antiPD-1) and relatlimab (anti LAG -3) versus nivolumab alone in patients with 
untreated advanced melanoma.  This study demonstrated that nivolumab and relatlimab

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
264/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  improved progression -free survival  (PFS   10.1 months) over nivolum ab 
(PFS   4.6 months).  The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related adverse events was 
18.9% in patients that received the nivolumab and relatlimab combination and 9.7% in 
patients that received nivolumab alonoe (Tawbi et al. 2022 ). 
An ongoing Phase I/ II study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of 
combination treatment with the anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody spartalizumab and the 
antiLAG-3 monoclonal antibody LAG525 in patients with advanced solid tumors.  
Preliminary anti -tumor activity was observed during the Phase I dose -escalation portion 
of the study, including durable responses in 2 of 5  patients with triple -negative breast 
cancer (TNBC) and in 2  of 8 patients with mesothelioma.  Analyses of tumor biopsies 
from the TNBC c ohort also showed a trend of conversion from an immune -cold to an 
immune -activated phenotype.  Common adverse events, i.e., adverse events reported in 
10% of patients, included fatigue (18%), diarrhea (15%), and nausea (12%).  
The incidence of Grade 3 4 adverse events was 8% for both the combination (n   121) 
and monotherapy (n   119) arms (Hong et al. 2018).  
An ongoing, first -in-human, dose -escalation, and dose -expansion Phase I study is 
evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the antiPD-1/LAG -3 dual affinity 
re-targeting protein (DART®) bsAb MGD013 in patients with advanced solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies.  During the dose -escalation phase of the study, the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached, and the safety pro file was consistent with 
antiPD-1 monotherapy.  During the dose -expansion phase, anti -tumor activity was 
observed in patients with TNBC (n   23; ORR, 4.3%; disease control rate [DCR], 39.1%), 
CPI-naive NSCLC (n   14; ORR, 14.3%; DCR, 64.3%), and epithelia l ovarian cancer 
(n  23; ORR, 8.7%; DCR, 52.2%).  Expression of LAG -3 and an IFN - gene signature at 
baseline was associated with objective responses (Luke et al. 2020).  Clinical studies 
evaluating MGD013 as monotherapy and in combination with anti HER -2 agents are 
ongoing.  
A14–2.4.1 Study NP41300  
Study NP41300 is an ongoing, first -in-human, dose -escalation, dose -expansion Phase I 
study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic activity of the 
antiPD-1/LAG -3 bsAb RO7247669 as a single -agent in pati ents with locally advanced 
and/or metastatic solid tumors.  Part A, the dose -escalation phase of the study, is 
designed to determine the MTD and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of 
RO7247669.  Part B of the study is designed to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of 
RO7247669 at the MTD or RDE in tumor -specific expansion cohorts.  
As of the data cutoff date, 1 March  2022, RO7247669 was well tolerated in the patients 
enrolled in Part A of the study.  No unexpected safety concern associated with

265/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  RO7247669 was identified.  No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed up to the 
maximum dose tested (2100 mg every 2 weeks [Q 2W]),  and no MTD was identified.  
The maximum dose of 2100 mg was determined to be the recommended dose for the 
dose -expansion phase (Part B) of Study NP41300.   As of the data cutoff of 
1 March  2022, 83 patients received treatment in Part B.   
As of the dat a cutoff date, 1 March  2022, the DCR in Part A of the study was 51.4% 
(18 of 35 evaluable patients), and the ORR was 17.1% (6 of 35 patients).  Among the 
patients treated with the proposed dose of 2100 mg Q2W, 7 of 13 patients had a best 
response of stable  disease or better (DCR   53.8%), including 4 patients with a 
confirmed partial response (PR, ORR   30.8%) .  Besides the confirmed partial responses 
(cPR) observed at the RDE , there were 2 cPRs at the 600 mg dose level (ORR   50.0%).  
As of the data cutoff date, 1 March 2022, in Part B of the study the DCR was 48.3% 
(28 of 58 patients) and the ORR was 5.2% (3 of 58 patients) among patients of the 
study treated at the RDE of 2100 mq Q2W ( Cohort s B1, B2 , and B3).  Within patients 
treated with 600 mg Q2W ( Cohort B5), the DCR was 40% (4 of  10 patients), and the 
ORR was 10% (1 of 10 patients).  Among patients treated with 600 mg Q3W, the DCR 
was 28.6% (2 of 7 patients) and the ORR was 14.3% (1 of 7 patients).

planned clinical studies.  
A14–2.5 CLINICAL STUDIES OF TIRAGOLUMAB  
Tiragolumab is currently under investigation in two ongoing clinical studies in patients 
with solid tumors (Studies GO30103 and GO40290) and i n one clinical study in patients 
with hematological malignancies (Study GO41036).  
A14–2.5.1 Study GO30103  
Study GO30103 is a first -in-human, open -label, multicenter, global, 
dose -escalation/dose -expansion Phase I study.  It was designed to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of tiragolumab as a single agent (Phase Ia) and in 
combination with atezolizumab (Phase Ib) in patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or 
metastatic incurable tumors, including urothelial cancer, renal cell cancer, NSC LC, head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), 
gastric cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and triple -negative breast cancer.  
As of the clinical cutoff date of 2 December 20 20, a total of 236 patients had been 
enrolled in Study GO30103.  Forty -two patients were enrolled in the Phase Ia portion of 
the study to receive single -agent tiragolumab, and 217 patients were enrolled in the 
Phase Ib portion of the study to receive tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab.

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
266/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  The lat ter group included 23 patients who crossed over from the Phase Ia portion of the 
study.  
The best observed response with tiragolumab monotherapy in the Phase Ia portion was 
prolonged stable disease in 8 of 42 patients, with some patients, including 1 patien t with 
CRC, experiencing a decrease in tumor size.  
In the Phase Ib portion, complete response was observed in 4 of 217 patients at 
tiragolumab dose levels of 400 mg (n   3/48) and 600 mg (n   1/104) in combination with 
1200 mg atezolizumab.  Partial respon se was observed in 27  of 217 patients at 
tiragolumab dose levels of 30 mg (n   2/13), 400  mg (n   6/48), and 600 mg (n   18/104) 
in combination with 1200 mg atezolizumab, including two patients who crossed over 
from the Phase Ia portion at the 600 mg dose  level.  Stable disease was observed in 
53 of 217 patients at tiragolumab dose levels of 2  mg (n   1/8), 8  mg (n   3/12), 30 mg 
(n  2/13), 100 mg (n   3/8), 400 mg (n   12/48), 600 mg (n   25/104), and 1200 mg 
(n  7/24) in combination with 1200  mg atezolizumab, including 8 patients who crossed 
over from the Phase Ia portion of the study ( 2 patients at 8 mg, 1 patient at 30 mg, 
2 patients at 100 mg, and 3 patients at 400  mg). 
As of 2 December 2020 , safety data were avail able for 235 safety -evaluable patients in 
Study GO30103.  A total of 42 patients were treated in the Phase Ia portion with 
tiragolumab as a single agent (2 mg to 1200 mg), while 216 patients were treated in the 
Phase Ib portion with tiragolumab at dose lev els of 2  mg to 1200 mg in combination with 
atezolizumab at 1200 mg, including 23 patients who crossed over from the Phase Ia 
portion to the Phase  Ib portion.  
Tiragolumab was tolerated across all administered dose levels both as a single agent 
and in combin ation with atezolizumab.  The MTD was not reached, and the maximum 
administered dose was 1200 mg.  No DLTs or clear dose -related trends in the incidence 
of adverse events were observed.  Grade  3 adverse event s, regardless of attribution to 
the study drug (s), were reported in 16 patients (38.1%) and 113 patients ( 52.3%) in the 
Phase Ia and Phase  Ib portions, respectively.  There were 14 reported deaths in the 
Phase Ia portion of the study, including 12 deaths due to malignant neoplasm 
progression, 1 death due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the context of progressive 
disease, and 1 death due to hepatic failure.  The death due to hepatic failure was 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.  One hundred eighteen  deaths 
were reported in th e Phase Ib portion of the study.  This included 111 deaths due to 
progressive disease ( 31 cases were reported as adverse event s during the adverse 
event  reporting period and coded as malignant neoplasm progression or neoplasm 
malignant), 2 deaths due to pulmonary embolism, 1  death due to esophageal 
hemorrhage, 1 death due to sepsis, 1 death due to septic shock, 1 death due to 
COVID -19, and 1 death due to upper airway obstruction.  Treatment -related serious

267/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  adverse events were reported in 1 patient in the Phase Ia portion (hepatic failure) and in 
10 patients (4. 6%) in the Phase Ib portion.  No patient discontinued study treatment due 
to adverse event s in th e Phase Ia portion of Study GO30103.  Adverse event s leading to 
treatment discontinuation were reported in 12 patients in the Phase Ib portion of the 
study, with a Grade 4 cardiac tamponade, a Grade 4 pneumonitis, and one event of 
Grade 2 arthralgia consid ered by the investigator to be related to the study drug(s).  
Adverse events of special interest were reported in 5 patients (11.9%) in the Phase Ia 
portion and 82 patients (38. 0%) in the Phase Ib portion of the study.  
Overall, tiragolumab as a single agen t or in combination with atezolizumab has been 
well tolerated, adverse events have been manageable, and the safety profile has been 
observed to be consistent across different solid tumor indications.  
A14–2.5.2 Study GO40290  
Study GO40290 is a Phase II, randomized, b linded, placebo -controlled study of 
tiragolumab plus atezolizumab compared with placebo plus atezolizumab in patients with 
previously untreated locally advanced unresectable or metastatic PD -L1positive 
NSCLC (defined as tumor proportion score [TPS]  1%). 
As of the primary clinical cutoff date of 30 June 2019, 135  patients with a PD -L1 TPS 
 1% were  included in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population and  were randomly assigned to 
receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (n   67) or placebo plus atezolizumab (n   68).  
As of the primary analysis, 47.8% of patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group 
versus 27.9% of patients in the placebo plus atezolizumab group were still receiving 
study treatment in the ITT population.  In the TPS   50% population, 65.5% of patients in 
the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group versus 24.1% of patients in the placebo plus 
atezolizumab group were still receiving study treatment.  
In all randomized patients,  the combination of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab improved 
the co -primar y endpoints of investigator -assessed ORR and progression -free survival 
(PFS) compared to placebo plus atezolizumab, with median follow -up of 5.9 months.  
ORR for tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was 31.3% (95%  CI: 19.5, 43.2) compared with 
placebo plus atezol izumab which was 16.2% (95%  CI: 6.7, 25.7).  Investigator -assessed 
median PFS for tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.2 months, 
not reached) compared with placebo plus atezolizumab which was 3.6 months 
(95%  CI: 2.7 months, 4.4 months), with a stratified hazard ratio (HR) of 0.57 
(95%  CI: 0.37, 0.90).  Investigator -assessed PFS was improved in the tiragolumab plus 
atezolizumab group over the placebo plus atezolizumab group (unstratified HR   0.33; 
95% CI: 0.15, 0.72; median PFS not reache d vs. 3.9 months, respectively).  
As of 2 December 2020, 67 safety -evaluable patients in the tiragolumab plus 
atezolizumab arm in Study GO40290 were treated with a median of 8 doses of

268/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  tiragolumab and atezolizumab (range: 1 38) for a median of 5.0 months 
(range:  0.0326.0).  In the placebo plus atezolizumab arm, 68 safety -evaluable patients 
were treated with a median of 5 doses of placebo and atezolizumab (range: 1 37) for a 
median of 2.8  months (range: 0.03 26.3).  
As of 30 June 2020 , in the Phase II randomi zed, placebo -controlled Study GO40290, 
a total of 135  safety -evaluable patients were administered either tiragolumab (600 mg 
recommended Phase II/III dose) in combination with atezolizumab or placebo in 
combination with atezolizumab.  The safety profile of  tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was 
similar to that of placebo plus atezolizumab - for all -grade adverse event s 
(98.5%  vs. 97.1%), Grade   3 adverse event s (53.7% vs. 50.0%), serious adverse 
event s (47.8% vs. 39.7%), and adverse event s leading to treatment discontinuation 
(13.4% vs. 11.8%).  Adverse events of special interest  were reported in 58.2% of 
patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab arm and in 32.4% of patients in the 
placebo plus atezolizumab arm.  One death due to Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) rea ctivation 
and possible secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was reported in this 
study, which was considered by the investigator to be related to the study drugs.  
Overall, tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab has been well tolerated, adverse 
events have been manageable, and t he safety profile seems to be consistent as 
reported across different solid tumor indications.  
Refer to the Tiragolumab  Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on all ongoing and 
planned clinical studies.  
A14–2.6 BENEFITRISK ASSESSMENT  
The combination of RO7247669 and tiragolumab has not yet been clinically tested.  
The combination of atezolizumab and tiragolumab has a favorable emergent benefit risk 
profile, and early clinical experience with RO7247669 suggest a sa fety profile 
comparable to that of atezolizumab and other PD -1/PD -L1 blocking antibodies  
(Appendix  12).  The combination of nivolumab (anti PD-1) and relatlimab (anti LAG-3) 
improve d PFS over nivolumab alone as first -line therapy in melanoma patients  in the 
Phase III  Relativity -047 study  (Tawbi et al. 2022 ), which  supports the expected benefit 
from RO7247669  (antiPD-1/antiLAG-3 bispecific  therapy ) in combination with 
tiragolumab.  Taking into account the potentially synergistic mechanisms of action of 
RO7247669 and tiragolumab, as well as their manageable and tolerable safety profiles 
(see Section  A14–5), combination treatment with these two agents has promise as a  
potential therap y in solid tumors such as melanoma.  
A minimum of 6 patients in Cohort 2 must complete the initial safety run -in phase.  If the 
combination is determined to be tolerable, enrollment into the preliminary phase may be 
opened , and the same arm in Cohort 1 can be opened for enrollment (refer to 
Appendix 1 4:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm  (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
269/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Section s 3.1.23.1.4  for details).  Patients in the safety run -in phase will be enrolled and 
treated in a sequential manner, with at least one week between the first patient and the 
remaining patients.  
The assessment will be based on safety data from a minimum of 6  patients who have 
received at least one dose of treatmen t (i.e., one dose of each agent) and who have 
completed safety follow -up assessments for at least 28 days.  If   30% of patients 
experience a treatment -related  Grade  3 adverse event,  enrollment in the safety run -in 
phase will be stopped.  There will be an evaluation of the benefit risk profile of that 
treatment by the Sponsor.  
After Cohort 2 safety  run-in patients have completed  2 cycles  of 2100 mg  RO7247669 
Q3W in combination with 600 mg tiragolumab Q3W in addition to  the required safety 
follow -up of 28  days, and the safety of the combination  has been assessed and deemed 
appropriate,  the combination may be investigated in additional Cohort 2 arms .  These 
arms will investigate administration of RO7247669 at doses lower than 2100 mg, 
e.g., 1200 mg and 600 mg.  This will further inform safety, pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anti-tumor  activity of  RO7247669 in combination 
with t iragolumab.  
If the stopping criteria are not met during the safety run -in phase, enrollment in Cohort  1 
will proceed.  
In addition, a minimum of 6  patients in Cohort 1 in the RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira arm 
must complete a safety evaluation before additional patients can be enrolled in that arm 
(refer to Section  3.1.3  for details).  
For the evaluation of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the benefit risk 
assessment, please refer to Section  1.3. 
A14–3 RATIONALE FOR DOSE A ND SCHEDULE  FOR RO7247669  
2100  mg  TIRA ARM 
A14–3.1 RATIONALE FOR RO7247 669 DOSE AND SCHEDUL E 
RO7247669 will be administered at a fixed dose of 2100 mg every 3 weeks ( Q3W ) 
(2100  mg on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle).  A fixed dosing regimen of 2100 mg Q3W was 
selected based on available clinical pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data from 
Study NP41300.  During the dose -escalation Part A of the study, RO7247669 was well 
tolerated, and no specific safety concern associated with RO7247669 was identified.  
No DLT up to the highest dose of 2100 mg Q2W was observed, and no MTD was 
identified.  Anti -tumor activity, as measured by radiographic PRs, was observed starting 
at a dose o f 600 mg Q2W.  PK results for RO7247669 were dose linear within the dose

270/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  range tested in Study  NP41300 and therefore predicted to be in the range of target 
saturation.  Peripheral receptor occupancy was   90% ~80 days after administration.  
Therefore, Q3W administration should result in similar receptor occupancy to Q2W on 
treatment.  A  Q3W regimen for RO7247669 is also more convenient when it is 
administered with tiragolumab, which is administered Q3W.  
In addition, RO7247669 was well tolerated in both the dose -range finding studies and 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) monkey toxicology studies up to the highest dose 
evaluated (100 mg/kg).  Toxicology findings were consistent with the findings in 
cynomolgus monkey studies of marketed CPIs.  
The supporting data for the selected dose can be found in the current  RO7247669 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
A14–3.2 RATIONALE FOR TIRAGOLUMAB  DOSE AND SCHEDULE  
Tiragolumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 600 mg IV Q3W (600 mg on Day  1 of 
each 21 -day cycle).  
The fixed dose of 600  mg IV Q3W was selected on the basis of  available clinical 
pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data from the combined Phase Ia/Phase Ib Study 
GO30103 with single -agent tiragolumab or tiragolumab in combination with 
atezolizumab.  In the Phase Ia portion of the study with tiragolumab as a single agent, 
the MTD was not reached, and no DLTs were observed during  dose -escalation.  As of 
the clinical cutoff date, anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) to tiragolumab were rare in the 
Phase Ia or Phase Ib portions across al l dose levels.  Complete occupancy of peripheral 
TIGIT receptors on CD4+, CD8+, and NK cells was observed beginning at 30 mg of 
tiragolumab in both the Phase Ia and Phase Ib portions of the study and remained 
sustained at all higher doses (unpublished Roch e data on file).  
Prolonged stable disease was observed in patients in the Phase Ia portion of the study 
at tiragolumab doses beginning at 400 mg.  In the Phase Ib portion of the study with 
tiragolumab plus atezolizumab, the MTD was not reached.  Anti-tumor  activity, as 
measured by radiographic partial responses, was observed across doses for 
tiragolumab beginning at 30 mg and ranging up to 600 mg in combination with 1200  mg 
atezolizumab.   Refer to the Tiragolumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional detai ls.

A14–4.2.2 Additional Permitted Therapy for RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira 
Arm in Cohort 2  
Patients are permitted to use the following therapies during the study:  
 Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases or symptomatic 
relief of pain) as outlined below:  
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted, provided it does not interfere with the 
assessment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion to be irradiated must not be 
the only site of measurable disease).  Treatment with tiragolumab may be 
continued during palliative radiotherapy.

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
277/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Treatment with RO7247669 may be continued during palliative radiotherapy 
with one exception:  palliative radiotherapy is not permitted on days when 
RO7247669 is administered.  
 Local therapy (e.g.,  surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, radiotherapy, radiofrequency 
ablation) as outlined below:  
Patients experiencing a mixed response requiring local therapy for control of 
three or fewer lesions may still be eligible to continue study treatment.  Patients 
who receive local therapy directed at a target lesion will no longer be evaluable 
for radiographic response but will remain evaluable for progression.  
 
Premedication with antihis tamines, antipyretics, and/or analgesics may be administered 
for the second and subsequent RO7247669 and tiragolumab infusions only, at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
In general, investigators should manage a patient's care (including preexisting 
cond itions) with supportive therapies other than those defined as cautionary or 
prohibited therapies as clinically  indicated, per local standard practice.  Patients who 
experience infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with 
acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-receptor antagonists 
(e.g.,  famotidine, cimetidine), or equivalent medications per local standard practice.  
Serious infusion -associated events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should 
be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g.,  supplemental oxygen 
and 2-adrenergic a gonists; refer to  Appendix  8 for details).  
A14–4.2.3 Cautionary Therapy for RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm 
A14–4.2.3.1 Corticosteroids, Immunosuppressive Medications, and Tumor 
Necrosis Factor - Inhibitors  
Systemic corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications,  and tumor necrosis factor - 
(TNF -) inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment 
with RO7247669 and/or tiragolumab .  Therefore, in situations in which systemic 
corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications,  or TNF - inhibitors would be routinely 
administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered.  If the 
alternatives are not feasible, systemic  corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications,  
and TNF - inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications, are recommended, at the 
discretion of the investigator, for the trea tment of specific adverse events when 
associated with RO7247669 and/or tiragolumab therapy (refer to  Appendix  9 for details) .

278/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A14–4.2.3.2 Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug -drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer 
(see Section  A14–4.2.3 ) may be used during the study at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
A14–4.2.4 Prohibited Therapy for RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm 
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited for 
various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent 
(see Section 4.4), and during study treatment until surgery, or unacceptable toxicity 
(Cohort 1), or until disease progression is documented and the patient has 
discontinued study treatment (Cohort 2), with the exception of palliative radiotherapy 
(see Section  A14–4.2.1  for details).  
 Investigational therapy is prohibited within 28 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment and during study treatment.  
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g.,  FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment, during treatment with RO7247669 and/or tiragolumab, 
and for 4  months after the last dose of RO7247669 and/or tiragolumab.  
 Systemic immunostimulatory agents (inc luding, but not limited to, interferons and 
interleukin -2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 half -lives of the drug (whichever is 
longer) prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment because 
these agents could potentially increase the  risk for autoimmune conditions when 
given in combination with RO7247669 and/or tiragolumab.  
 
A14–4.3 CONTRACEPTION REQUIR EMENTS FOR  RO7247669  
2100  mg  TIRA ARM 
Contraception requirements for women and men  in the RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira arm 
are outlined below:  
 For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:  
Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate 
of  1% per year during the tre atment period, for 4 months after the last dose of 
RO7247669, and for 90 days after the last dose of tiragolumab.  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months  of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not

(e.g.,  Müllerian agenesis).  The de finition of childbearing potential may be 
adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.  
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of  1% per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized acceptable 
methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will 
be described in the local Informed Consent Form.  
 For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or 
use contraception , and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as def ined below:  
With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant or a 
pregnant female partner, men who are not surgically sterile must remain 
abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that 
together result in a failure  rate of  1% per year during the treatment period, for 
4 months after the last dose of RO7247669, and for 90 days after the last dose 
of tiragolumab to avoid exposing the embryo.  Men must refrain from donating 
sperm during this same period.  
The reliabili ty of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are  not acceptable methods of preventing drug 
exposure.  If  required per local guidelines or regulations, information about the 
reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.  
 
A14–5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  FOR RO7247669  2100 mg  TIRA 
ARM 
A14–5.1 SAFETY PLAN FOR RO72 47669 2100 mg  TIRA ARM 
The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with RO7247669 
and tiragolumab in completed and ongoing studies.  The anticipated important safety 
risks are outlined below (see Sections  A14–5.1.1 , A14–5.1.2 , A14–5.1.3 , and  A14–
5.1.4 ).  Guidelines for the management of patients who experience specific adverse 
events are provided in Section A14–5.1.4  and Appendix  9. 
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, 
including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of 
Appendix 1 4:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm  (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
280/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  patients during the study.  Because of the potential for overlapping toxicities for  
RO7247669 and tiragolumab, special caution will be taken by performing a planned 
safety run -in for patients randomized to this arm in Cohort 2, and a planned safety 
evaluation phase in Cohort 1 (see Section  3.1.4 ). 
Administration of RO7247669 and tiragolumab will be performed in a monitored setting 
in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment and 
medicine to manage potentially serious reactions.  Adverse events will be reported as 
described in Sections 5.25.6. 
A14–5.1.1 Risks Asso ciated with RO7247669  
Clinical evaluation of RO7247669 is ongoing, and not all risks are known.  As an 
antagonist of PD -1 and LAG -3, RO7247669 is anticipated to enhance T -cell and NK -cell 
proliferation, survival, and function.  Based on the mechanism -of-action of RO7247669, 
the safety profile is anticipated to be similar to other CPIs.  Potential risks associated 
with RO7247669 include the following:  IRRs (including anaphylaxis), immunogenicity, 
and immune -mediated adverse events.  Refer to Section  6 of the RO7247669 
Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for 
RO7247669.  
A14–5.1.1.1 Infusion -Related Reactions and Anaphylaxis  
Administration of therapeutic antibodies may cause IRRs, which may include symptoms 
such as fever, chills , hypotension, shortness of breath, skin rash, headache, nausea, 
and vomiting.  Such reactions typically occur during or shortly after the infusion and are 
predominantly reported following the first infusion.  The incidence and severity of IRRs 
typically d ecrease with subsequent infusions.  Based on in vitro data, the risk of 
proinflammatory cytokine -mediated IRRs on first administration of RO7247669 as single 
agent is considered low.  
Refer to Section  A14–4.1.2  for detailed guidance on administration of RO7247669 in this 
study.  Refer to  Appendix  8 for guidance on anaphylaxis precautions and Section   
A14–5.1.4.3  for guidance on the management of IRRs.  
A14–5.1.1.2 Immunogenicity  
Administration of therapeutic antibodies may cause the formation of anti -drug antibodies, 
which may negatively affect the safety of the therapeutic (e.g., allergic reactions, 
immune complex -mediated diseases).  
A14–5.1.1.3 Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
The co -stimulatory action of RO72 47669, particularly given the LAG -3 modulation, might 
bear the risk of exaggerated immune cell activation that may result in the occurrence of 
Appendix 1 4:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm  (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
281/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  enhanced, untoward, immune -mediated adverse events and increased 
cytokine -releasemediated toxicities.  
Toxicities  from PD -1 blocking agents can involve any organ or tissue, although some 
immune -mediated adverse events occur much more frequently than others.  The most 
frequently occurring immune -mediated adverse events affect skin, colon, endocrine 
organs, liver, and lungs.  Others are very infrequent but may be very serious, even 
lethal, such as neurological disorders and myocarditis.  
The limited data from recent early phase studies showed that antiLAG-3therapy was 
generally  well tolerated as a monotherapy or in comb ination with anti-PD-1 therapies, 
and consistent with the safety profiles of other CPIs (Ascierto et  al. 2017; Hong et al. 
2018).  
In this study, specified immune -mediated adverse events will be considered adverse 
events of special interest and will be capt ured accordingly (see Section  A14–5.2 for the 
list of adverse events of special interest and Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  
Patients with a history of autoimmune disease will be excluded from this study.  Please 
see Section  4.1.2  for details.  
A14–5.1.2 Risks Associated with Tiragolumab  
Infusion -related reactions and immune -mediated hepatitis are  identified risk s of 
tiragolumab.  Lymphopenia is a potential risk with tiragolumab.  Although  clinical 
evaluation of tiragolumab is limited and not all risks are known, as an antagonist of 
TIGIT, tiragolumab is anticipated to enhance T -cell and NK -cell proliferation, survival, 
and function.  Therefore, tiragolumab may increase the risk of autoimmu ne inflammation 
(also described as immune -mediated adverse events).   
Refer to  Appendix  9 of the protocol and  the Tiragol umab Investigator’s Brochure for  a 
detailed description of anticipated safety risks of tiragolumab . 
A14–5.1.2.1 Infusion -Related Reactions  
Because tiragolumab is a therapeutic monoclonal antibody and targets immune cells, 
IRRs associated with hypersensitivity reactions, and/or target -mediated cytokine 
releasemay occur.  Clinical signs and symptoms of such reactions may include rigors, 
chills,  wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever.  
IRRs have been reported in patients treated with tiragolumab.  The majority of events 
were mild to moderate and manageable.  
Appendix 1 4:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm  (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
282/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  To minimize the risk and sequelae of IRRs, the initial dose of tiragolumab will be 
administered over 60 minutes followed by a 60 -minute observation period.  Subsequent 
infusions and observation times may be shortened  if the preceding infusion was  well 
tolerated.  All infusions will be administered in an appropriate  medical setting.  
Refer to Section A14–4.1.2  for detailed guidance on administration of tiragolumab in this 
study.  Please see Appendix  8 for guidance on anaphylaxis precautions and  Table  A14-
4 for guidance on the management of IRRs.  
A14–5.1.2.2 Immune -Mediated Hepatitis  
The use of tiragolumab to block the immune inhibitory receptor TIGIT serves to increase 
a baseline T -cell and NK -cell immune response, especially in combination with other 
checkpoint inhibitors.  A disruption in the functioning of immune checkpoint molecules 
may lead to imbalances in immunologic tolerance that results in an unchecked immune 
response, including immune -media ted hepatitis.  
Refer t o Appendix  9 for guidance on the management of immune -mediated hepatitis.  
A14–5.1.2.3 Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
Nonclinical models have suggested a role of TIGIT signaling interruption in 
autoimmunity.  In  a knockout model (TIGIT /), loss of TIGIT signaling resulted in 
hyperproliferative T -cell responses and exacerbation of experimental autoimmune 
encephalitis (EAE).  TIGIT / and wild -type B6 mice were immunized with myelin 
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein pe ptide in an EAE using suboptimal doses.  In contrast to 
the wild -type B6 mice, the majority of the TIGIT / mice developed severe EAE 
(Joller  et al. 2011).  
Clinical experience with therapeutics intended to enhance anti -tumor T -cell responses 
has demonstrat ed that development of autoimmune inflammatory conditions is a general 
risk and may therefore be considered a potential risk of tiragolumab.  Such 
immune -mediated adverse events have been described for virtually all organ systems 
and include, but are not l imited to, colitis, pneumonitis, endocrinopath ies, ocular toxicity, 
pancreatic toxicity, neurologic toxicity, cardiac toxicity , nephritis, myositis , and severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions . 
Patients with a history of autoimmune disease will be excluded from  this study  
(see Section  4.1.2 ). 
In this study, immune -mediated adverse events will be considered adverse events of 
special interest and will be captured accordingly (see Section A14–5.2 for the list of 
adverse events of special interest and Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  
Appendix 1 4:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm  (Cohorts 1 and 2)  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
283/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Suggested management guidelines for individual  suspected immune -mediated adverse 
events are provided in Appendix  9. 
A14–5.1.2.4 Lymphopenia  
The IgG1 backbone of tiragolumab with intact Fc -effector function may lead to  
ADCC -mediated reduction in lymphocyte count.  Lymphopenia is a potential risk with 
tiragolumab .  Transient decreases in  lymphocyte count without clinical sequelae have 
been observed in patients treated with tiragolumab . 
Patients with a lymphocyte count  0.5   109/L (500/L) will be excluded from the study  
(see Section  4.1.1 ), and  complete blood counts will be monitored regularly during  the 
study  (see Appendix A14–6). 
A14–5.1.2.5 Embryofetal Toxicity  
Embryofetal toxicity is a potential risk with tiragolumab.  Administration of tiragolumab is  
expected to have adverse effects on pregnancy based on the expression of TIGIT on 
decidual NK and CD8  T cells (Powell et al. 2017; van der Zwan et al. 2018; 
Vento -Tormo et al. 2018), and the expected role of these cells in the recognition and 
response to  foreign fetal, placental, and viral antigens at the maternal -fetal interface as 
well as maintenance of maternal -fetal tolerance.  No reproductive or teratogenicity 
studies in animals have been conducted with tiragolumab.  There are no clinical studies 
of tiragolumab in pregnant women.  Tiragolumab should not be administered to pregnant 
women.  
Refer to Section 6 of the Tiragolumab Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description 
of embryofetal toxicity.  
A14–5.1.3 Risks Associated with Combination Use of RO7247669 a nd 
Tiragolumab  
The blockade of inhibitory checkpoints leads to increase adaptive T -cell immune 
responses via complementary targets, and the combination targeting multiple 
checkpoints may be associated with heightened immune -mediated toxicity relative to 
either agent alone.  Such toxicity could manifest as a higher incidence or greater severity 
of autoimmune inflammation events, or potentially the development of HLH and MAS.  
The following adverse events are potential overlapping toxicities associated with 
combination use of RO7247669 plus tiragolumab:  IRR and immune -mediated toxicities, 
(see Appendix  9 for complete list).

Events in the RO7247669  2100 mg   Tira Arm 
A14–5.1.4.1 Dose Modifications  
There will be no dose modifications for RO7247669 or tiragolumab in this study.   
However, based on emerging safety and efficacy data,  the Sponsor may exp lore lower 
dose s of RO7247669  (e.g., 1200 mg and 600 mg). 
A14–5.1.4.2 Treatment Interruption for Toxicities  
Treatment with RO7247669 and tiragolumab may be temporarily suspended in patients 
experiencing toxicity considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are 
initiated for treatment of the toxicity, they must be tapered over  1 month to the 
equivalent of  10 mg/day o ral prednisone before study treatment can be resumed,  if 
warranted.   
For Cohort 1, i n the neoadjuvant setting the study treatment is limited to a pre -surgery 
window of 6 weeks.  Treatment during this period should not be interrupted  unless a 
patient exper iences toxicity.   If toxicity meets criteria for interrupting/withholding 
RO7247669 and tiragolumab , RO7247669 and tiragolumab  should be 
interrupted/withheld.   After resolution of the toxicity, subsequent treatment cycles should 
only be considered if the b enefit/risk profile is acceptable and if the surgery can be 
conducted within 2 weeks of the planned date.  Otherwise, subsequent treatment cycles 
should be omitted to allow the patient to proceed directly to surgery without further delay . 
For Cohort 2,  if RO7247669  and tiragolumab  are withheld for 12  weeks or longer due to 
toxicity, the patient should be discontinued from RO7247669 and tiragolumab.  However, 
RO7247669 and tiragolumab  may be withheld for more than  12 weeks to allow for 
patients to taper off corticosteroids prior to resuming treatment.  RO7247669 and 
tiragolumab may be resumed after being withheld for more than  12 weeks if the patient is 
likely to derive clinical benefit.  RO7247669 and tiragolumab treatment may be 
suspended for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) at the discretion of 
the investigator.  The acceptable length of the extended period of time must be must be 
based on the investigator’s benefitrisk assessment  and in al ignment with the protocol 
requirements for the duration of treatment and documented by the investigator.  The 
Medical Monitor is available to advise as needed .

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
285/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  On the basis of the available characterization of mechanism -of-action, tiragolumab may 
cause ad verse events similar to, but independent of, RO7247669 .  Tiragolumab may 
also exacerbate the frequency or severity of RO7247669 -related adverse events or may 
have non -overlapping toxicities with RO7247669 .  Because these scenarios may not be 
distinguishabl e from each other in the clinical setting, adverse events should generally 
be attributed to both agents, and dose interruptions or treatment discontinuation in 
response to adverse events should be applied to both tiragolumab and RO7247669 .  
If RO7247669 is withheld  or discontinued, tiragolumab should also be withheld or 
discontinued.  If tiragolumab is withheld  or discontinued, RO7247669 should also be 
withheld  or discontinued.  
A14–5.1.4.3 Management Guidelines for Adverse Events  
Guidelines for the management of patients who experience specific adverse events are 
provided in  Table  A14-4 and Appendix  9. 
For cases in which management guidelines are not covered in  Appendix  9, patients 
should be managed and treatments should be withheld or discontinued as deemed 
appropriate by the investigator according to best medical judgment.

A14–5.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Informed Consent 
Form to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or 
within 4 months after the last dose of RO7247669 or within 90 days after the l ast dose of 
tiragolumab.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and e -mailing the form using 
the fax number or e -mail address provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study 
treatment and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the 
possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion 
of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an 
event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnanc y, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In 
addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when 
updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy bec omes available.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When permitted 
by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health Information 
would need to be signed by one or both parents (as per local regu lations) to allow for 
follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's health status at 
birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form.  In addition, the 
Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant's health status at 6 and 
12 months after birth.  
A14–5.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients  
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the st udy or within 
4 months after the last dose of RO7247669 or within 90 days after the last dose of 
tiragolumab.  The investigator should report the pregnancy on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit the form to the Sponsor or its desig nee 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by 
faxing or by scanning and e -mailing the form using the fax number or e -mail address 
provided to investigators.  Attempts should be made to collect and report details o f the 
course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study 
treatment.  When permitted by the site, the pregnant partner would need to sign an 
Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow  for 
follow -up on her pregnancy.  If the authorization has been signed, the investigator 
should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form with additional information on

available.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When permitted 
by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health Information 
would need to be signed by one or both parents (as per local regulation s) to allow for 
follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's health status at 
birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form.  In addition, the 
Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant 's health status at 6 and 
12 months after birth.  
An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide 
information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, to 
support an informed decision in co operation with the treating physician and/or 
obstetrician.  
A14–5.3.3 Abortions  
A spontaneous  abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as  the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and reported t o the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section  5.4.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after l earning of the event; see Section  5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal  or 
embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.  
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
A14–5.3.4 Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born  to a female patient exposed to study 
treatment or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study treatment should be 
classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more t han 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section  5.2.2 ).

294/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  f After initiation of study treatment, all  adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new 
systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first, and serious adverse events and adverse events of  special interest will continue to be 
reported until 135 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  After 
this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  In addition, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of 
any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior exposure to study treatment (see Section 5.6).  For details on reporting all 
treatment -related non -serious adverse events that lead to surgical delay, see Section  5.6.  The investigator should follow each adverse event 
until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is  lost to follow -up, or the 
patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study treatm ent or trial -
related procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
g Patients  who complete the treatment period , regardless of whether they complete the study drug treatment period or discontinue study drug 
prematurely, patients who proceed to surgery will have their first long-term follow -up visit 3 months after surgery and patients who do not 
proceed to surgery  will have their f irst long-term follow -up visit 3  months after the final dose of study treatment.  Information on survival follow -up 
and new anti -cancer therapy (including targeted therapy and immunotherapy) will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records,  
and/or clinic visits approximately every 3 months until death (unless the patient withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study).  If a 
patient requests to be withdrawn from follow -up, this request must be documented in the source documents and sign ed by the investigator.  If a 
patient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., county records) to obtain inform ation about survival 
status only.  For an experimental arm in which all patients discontinued treatme nt and passed the safety follow -up window, as well as 
approximately 80% of patients discontinued the study, the Sponsor may conclude the arm (the remaining ~20% of patients will b e discontinued 
from the study).  
h Laboratory tests must be performed within 7 2 hours prior to dosing during the  treatment period.   If screening laboratory assessments were 
performed within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1, they do not have to be repeated.  
i At the pre -surgery visit, adrenocorticotropic hormone , cortisol, S100, an d erythrocyte sedimentation rate will be included in the chemistry panel.  
j This is only applicable if elevated levels of cardiac enzymes were detected in previous assessments.  
k If periods are missed or delayed before the 6 -month follow -up visit, pregnancy testing should be repeated.  This test can be performed by a local 
gynecologist.  
l The Cycle 2 Day 1  on-treatment tissue sample must  be collected up to 72 hours  prior to drug administration.

RO7247669 is a novel, Fc -silent IgG1 -based bispecific antibody (bsAb) in 1   1 format 
that incorporates monovalent binding to two immune checkpoint proteins:  PD -1 and 
LAG -3.  RO7247669 is designed to target dysfunctional tumor antigen -specific 
T-lymphocytes expressing PD -1 and LAG -3 to establish or re -establish an effective 
anti-tumor immune response in cancer patients.  This may result in improved 
therapeutic responses over cu rrently available therapies.  In  addition, RO7247669 is 
engineered to prevent binding to Fc gamma receptors, thus potentially avoiding 
tumor -associated macrophage resistance mechanisms.  Such mechanisms have been 
observed with IgG4 -based anti PD-1 antibodi es, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
(Arlauckas  et al. 2017).  Clinical evaluation of RO7247669 is ongoing in a 
first -in-human, dose -finding study (NP41300) as a single agent in cancer patients with 
and without prior checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) exposure.    
Refer to the RO7247669 Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinical and other 
planned and ongoing clinical studies.  
A15–2 RATIONALE FOR RO7247 669 600 mg ARM  
A15–2.1 TARGETING THE PD -1 AND LAG -3 ANTIGENS  
Cancer immunotherapy agents, particularly immune CPIs, have had a significant 
impact on the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies in recent years.  
However, despite the remarkable clinical efficacy of these therapies, additional 
treatment options targeting immune checkpoints are needed because the m ajority of 
patients eventually progress after an initial response or else fail to respond to the 
PD-1/PD -L1 checkpoint blockade.  This is believed to be due mainly to primary or 
secondary resistance mechanisms, to immunosuppressive activity of myeloid -derived 
suppressor cells, and/or to T -regulatory cells (Sharma et al. 2017).  
To overcome resistance mechanisms, additional treatment options and multiple 
combinations with anti PD-L1 therapy are being assessed.  One potential reason for 
resistance to anti PD-L1 therapy is the upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints 
with non -redundant regulatory functions (Sharma et al. 2017).  LAG -3 is one such 
alternative immune checkpoint.  LAG -3 is a member of the Ig superfamily that is 
structurally similar to CD4.  L AG-3 is expressed on activated effector T cells and is 
constitutively expressed on T -regulatory cells and natural killer ( NK)  cells.  
The expression of both PD -1 and LAG -3 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) 
correlates with the degree of impairment of  effector functions, which is associated with 
poor prognosis (Matsuzaki  et al. 2010; Baitsch et al. 2011; Thommen et al. 2015).  
Hence, LAG -3 is a marker of T -cell dysfunctionality.  LAG -3 also regulates T -cell 
functions, presumably including the function of T-regulatory cells.  In chronic 
infections and cancer, LAG -3, together with PD -1, contributes to T -cellacquired 
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
308/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  dysfunctionality and to the inability of T  cells to mount an effective/protective immune 
response upon interaction with the LAG -3 ligand, MH C-II. 
The interaction of LAG -3 with MHC -II inhibits T -cell proliferation, activation, 
cytolytic function, and proinflammatory cytokine production (Goldberg and Drake 
2011).  The effect of LAG -3 expression on T -regulatory cells is controversial.  An early 
report concluded that LAG -3 promotes T-regulatory cell -mediated immune suppression  
(Camisaschi et al. 2010).  However, a more recent report from the same authors found 
that LAG -3 limits T-regulatory cell -mediated immune suppression (Zhang et al. 2017).  
Expression of LAG -3 has been reported across various tumor types, including breast 
cancer, ovarian cancer, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, renal cell 
cancer (RCC), prostate cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  In patients with 
these t umor types, LAG -3 is associated with poor prognosis (Matsuzaki et al. 2010; 
Baitsch et al. 2011; Thommen et al. 2015; He et al. 2016; Norstrom et al. 2016).  
Clinical evaluation of anti LAG -3 agents, as single agents and in combination with 
other CPIs, is ongoing in several early phase studies in patients with advanced solid 
tumors (Long  et al. 2018).  Preliminary data demonstrate that anti LAG -3 therapy is 
well tolerated, both as single agents and in combination with anti PD-1 therapies, and 
the safety pro files are consistent with those of other CPIs (Ascierto et al. 2017; 
Hong  et al. 2018; Stratton  et al. 2018).  RO7247669 may therefore be a therapeutic 
option for patients with melanoma.  
Resistance to PD -L1/PD -1 blockade may result in the expression of mul tiple 
co-inhibitory immune checkpoints on the surface of effector T cells.  LAG -3 is 
frequently co -expressed with PD -1 on TILs, and dual blockade of PD -1 and LAG -3 
enhances CD 8+ T-cell effector function and potentiates anti -tumor immunity in 
nonclinical mo dels.  Blockade of these two receptors in mice with colon, fibrosarcoma, 
or ovarian tumors resulted in tumor remission in approximately 80% of animals, 
compared with remission in 10% to 40% with blockade of either receptor using a single 
agent (Woo et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2015).  TILs from patients with ovarian cancer 
showed that antigen -specific CD8+ T cells co -expressing PD -1 and LAG -3 exhibited 
greater impairment in their ability to respond to cognate antigen stimulation compared 
with CD8+ T cells that  expressed one checkpoint molecule (Matsuzaki et al. 2010).  
In patients with NSCLC, overexpression of LAG -3 on TILs correlated with 
PD-1/PD -L1 expression and was linked to higher risk of recurrence and poor survival 
outcomes (He et al. 2017).  
A15–2.2 CLINICAL STUDIES OF AGENTS TA RGETING THE PD -1 
AND LAG -3 PATHWAYS  
Clinical data are available for early - and late -phase  studies that evaluated the safety, 
tolerability, and preliminary anti -tumor activity of agents that target both the PD -1 
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
309/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  and LAG -3 pathways.  Evid ence of clinical activity has been reported in some of these 
studies.  Overall, adverse events have been manageable to date, and the safety profiles 
appear similar to those of single -agent CPIs.  
An ongoing Phase I/IIa study is evaluating the safety, tolera bility, and clinical activity 
of combination treatment with the anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab and the 
antiLAG -3 monoclonal antibody relatlimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.  
Preliminary data suggest that the combination of nivolumab an d relatlimab may have 
an increased benefit compared with single -agent anti PD-1.  In a cohort of patients 
who had advanced melanoma who were previously treated with anti PD-1/PD -L1 
agents, the ORR was 11.5% ( n  61) with a disease control rate (DCR) of 49%.  
The antiPD-1/PD -L1 treatment combination had an acceptable safety profile that was  
similar to the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy (Ascierto et al. 2017).  
Relativity -047 is a Phase III study evaluating t he combination of nivolumab 
(antiPD-1) and relatlimab (anti LAG -3) versus nivolumab alone in patients with 
untreated advanced melanoma.   This study demonstrated  that nivolumab and relatlimab  
improved progression -free survival  (PFS   10.1 months) over nivolumab  
(PFS   4.6 months).   The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related adverse events was  
18.9% in patients  that received  the nivolumab and relatlimab combination and 9.7% in 
patients that received nivolumab  alone  (Tawbi et al. 2022 ). 
An ongoing Phase I/II study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity 
of combination treatment with the anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody spartalizumab and 
the antiLAG -3 monoclonal antibody LAG525 in patients with advanced solid tumors.  
Preliminary anti -tumor activity was observe d during the Phase I dose -escalation 
portion of the study, including durable responses in 2 of 5  patients with triple -negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) and in 2  of 8 patients with mesothelioma.  Analyses of tumor 
biopsies from the TNBC cohort also showed a tre nd of conversion from an immune -cold 
to an immune -activated phenotype.  Common adverse events, i.e., adverse events 
reported in   10% of patients, included fatigue (18%), diarrhea (15%), and nausea 
(12%).  The incidence of Grade 3 4 adverse events was 8% for both the combination 
(n   121) and monotherapy ( n  119) arms (Hong et al. 2018).  
An ongoing, first -in-human, dose -escalation, and dose -expansion Phase I study is 
evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the anti PD-1/LAG -3 dual 
affinity re -targeting protein (DART) bsAb MGD013 in patients with advanced solid 
tumors and hematologic malignancies.  During the dose -escalation phase of the study, 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached, and the safety profile was 
consistent wit h antiPD-1 monotherapy.  During the dose -expansion phase, anti -tumor 
activity was observed in patients with TNBC (n   23; ORR, 4.3%; DCR, 39.1%), 
CPI-naive NSCLC (n   14; ORR, 14.3%; DCR, 64.3%), and epithelial ovarian cancer 
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
310/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  (n   23; ORR, 8.7%; DCR, 52.2%).  Expression of LAG -3 and an IFN - gene signature 
at baseline was associated with objective responses (Luke et al. 2020).  Clinical studies 
evaluating MGD013 as monotherapy and in combination with anti HER -2 agents are 
ongoing.  
A15–2.2.1  Study NP41300  
Study N P41300 is an ongoing, first -in-human, dose -escalation, dose -expansion Phase I 
study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic activity of the 
antiPD-1/LAG -3 bsAb RO7247669 as a single agent in patients with locally advanced 
and/or metastat ic solid tumors.  Part A, the dose -escalation phase of the study, is 
designed to determine the MTD and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of 
RO7247669.  Part B of the study is designed to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of 
RO7247669 at the MTD or RDE  in tumor -specific expansion cohorts.  
As of the data cutoff date , 1 March 20 22, RO7247669 was well tolerated in the patients 
enrolled in Part A of the study.  No unexpected safety concern associated with 
RO7247669 was identified.  No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed up to the 
maximum dose tested (2100 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W]),  and no MTD was identified.  
The maximum dose of 2100 mg was determined to be the recommended dose for the 
dose -expansion phase (Part B) of Study NP41300.  As of the  data cutoff  of 1 March 
2022, 83 patients received treatment in Part B.  
As of the data cut -off date of 1 March 202 2, the DCR in Part A of the study was 51.4% 
(18 of 35 evaluable patients), and the ORR was 17.1% (6 of 35 patients).  Among the 
patients trea ted with the proposed dose of 2100 mg Q2W, 7 of 13 patients had a best 
response of stable disease or better (DCR   53.8%), including 4 patients with a 
confirmed partial response (PR; ORR   30.8%) .  Besides the confirmed partial responses 
(cPR) observed at the RDE , there were 2 cPRs at the 600 mg dose level (ORR   50.0%).  
As of  the data cut -off date,  1 March 2022, in Part B of the study the DCR was 48.3% 
(28 of 58 patients) and the ORR was 5.2% (3 of 58 patients)  among patients of the 
study treated at the RDE of 2100 mq Q2W  (Cohort s B1, B2 , and B3).  Within patients 
treated with 600 mg Q2W (cohort B5), the DCR was 40% (4  of 10 patients ), and the 
ORR was 10% (1  of 10 patients ).  Among patients treated with 600 mg Q3W, the DCR 
was 28.6% (2  of 7 patients ) and the ORR was 14.3% (1  of 7 patients ). 
Refer to the RO7247669 Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on all ongoing 
and planned clinical studies.  
A15–2.3 BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT  
Despite limited clinical experience with RO7247669, the clinical efficacy and safety 
profiles of anti PD-1/PD -L1 monoclonal antibodies are well characterized and 
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
311/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  established.  In recent years, four checkpoint inhibitors, namely pembrolizumab,  
nivolumab, ipilimumab,  and relatlimab  have been approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of un resectable or advanced melanoma.  
The co -stimulatory action of RO7247669 on PD -1 and LAG -3 receptors may result in 
enhanced and/or more durable responses than either therapy modality alone.  However, 
there may be a risk of exaggerated immune cell activation , particularly given the LAG -3 
modulation of the immune response.  Preliminary data from Study NP41300, and 
recent early phase studies of anti LAG -3 antibodies showed that anti LAG -3 therapy 
was generally well tolerated as monotherapy or in combination with antiPD-1 
therapies, and that it had a safety profile consistent with the safety profiles of other 
CPIs ( Ascierto et al. 2017 ; Hong et al. 2018; Stratton et al. 2018 ).  The safety and 
efficacy of CPIs is established in the adjuvant setting, and CPIs a re now being actively 
evaluated as neoadjuvant treatment and show promising early results (Herrscher and 
Robert 2020).

A15–3 RATIONALE FOR DOSE A ND SCHEDULE FOR RO72 47669 
600 mg ARM  
A15–3.1 RATIONALE FOR RO7247 669 DOSE AND SCHEDUL E 
RO7247669 will be administered at a fixed dose of 600 mg every 3 weeks ( Q3W ) 
(600 mg on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle).  A fixed dosing regimen of 600 mg Q3W was 
selected based on available clinical pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data from 
Study NP41300.  During the dose -escalation Part A of the study, RO7247669 was well 
tolerated,  and no specific safety concern associated with RO7247669 was identified.  No 
DLT up to the highest dose of 2100 mg Q2W was observed, and no MTD was identified.  
Anti -tumor activity, as measured by radiographic partial responses , was observed 
starting at a  dose of 600 mg Q2W.  The pharmacokinetics of RO7247669 were dose 
linear within the dose range tested in Study NP41300.  Greater than 90% occupancy of 
peripheral PD -1 and LAG3 receptors on CD8+ cells was observed at 50 mg of 
RO7247669 and was sustained at all higher doses (unpublished Roche data on file).   
Further modelling of intratumoral PD -1 and LAG3 target engagement using estimated 
target properties was performed.  A dose regimen of 600  mg Q3W was selected for this 
study (BO43328) to ensure that the ma jority of participants have at least 90% PD -1 
and LAG3 tumor receptor saturation by RO7247669, irrespective of intratumoral 
spatial heterogeneity and intersubject variability .  A dose greater than 600 mg would 
not be expected to result in further clinical activity . 
In Study NP41300, persistent anti-drug antibodies ( ADAs ) formed in approximately 
18% of the total population and the incidence rate was not dose dependent.  An impact 
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
312/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  on exposure was observed at 50, 150 and 300 mg ; therefore , 600 mg will be used  in 
Study BO43328 to minimize the risk of a loss in exposure due to ADAs.   
In addition, RO7247669 was well tolerated in both the dose range finding studies and 
Good Laboratory Pra ctice (GLP) monkey toxicology studies up to the highest dose 
evaluated (100 mg/kg).  Toxicology findings were consistent with the findings in 
cynomolgus monkey studies of marketed CPIs .  In the current study  (BO43328) , the 
safety evaluation of the first 6 patients enrolled in the RO7247669  2100  mg arm  was 
completed  with  no safety signals identified.  
The supporting data for the selected dose can be found in the RO7247669 Investigator’s

and 2-adrenergic agonists; see Appendix  8). 
A15–4.2.2  Cautionary Therapy for RO7247669  600 mg  Arm  
A15–4.2.2.1  Corticosteroids, Immunosuppressive Medications, and Tumor 
Necrosis Factor - Inhibitors  
Systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, and tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) - inhibitors may attenuate potential  beneficial immunologic effects of treatment 
with RO7247669.  Therefore, in situations in which systemic corticosteroids, 
immunosuppressive medications, or TNF - inhibitors would be routinely administered, 
alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered.  If the alternatives are not 
feasible, systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, and TNF - 
inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications are recomm ended, at the 
discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events when 
associated with RO7247669 therapy (see Appendix  9 for details).  
A15–4.2.2.2  Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer 
(see Section  A15–4.2.3 ) may be used during the study at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
A15–4.2.3  Prohibited Therapy for RO7247669  600 mg  Arm  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not 
limited to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and 
herbal therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited 
for various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent 
(see Section  4.1.2 ), and during study treatment until surgery or, if earlier, disease 
progression is documented and the patient has discontinued study treatment.  
 Investigational therapy is prohibited within 28 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment and during study treatment.  
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g.,  FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment, during treatment with RO7247669, and for 4  months 
after the final dose of RO7247669.  
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
316/Protocol BO43328, Version 4   Systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferons and 
interleukin -2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 drug -elimination half -lives 
(whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment and during study

conditions when given in combination with RO7247669.  
 
A15–4.3 CONTRACEPTION REQUIR EMENTS FOR RO7247669  
600 mg ARM  
Contraception requirements for women and men in the RO7247669  600 mg  arm are 
outlined below:  
 For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:  
Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate 
of  1% per year during the treatment period and for 4 months after the final 
dose of RO7247669.  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no  identified cause other than menopause), and is not 
permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, 
and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator 
(e.g.,  Müllerian agenesis).  The definition of childbeari ng potential may be 
adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.  
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of   1% per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hor mone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g ., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  If  required per local guidelines or regulations, locally 
recognized acceptable methods of contraception and information about the 
reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.  
 For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or 
use contraception, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:  
With a fem ale partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant or a 
pregnant female partner, men who are not surgically sterile must remain 
abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that 
together result in a failure rate of   1% per year  during the treatment period, 
for 4  months after the last dose of RO7247669 to avoid exposing the embryo.  
Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.

317/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of  the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
preventing drug exposure.  If  required per loca l guidelines or regulations, 
information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local 
Informed Consent Form.  
 
A15–5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  FOR RO7247669  600 mg ARM  
A15–5.1 SAFETY PLAN FOR RO72 47669  600 mg ARM  
The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with 
RO7247669 in ongoing studies.  The potential safety risks are outlined below (see 
Section  A15–5.1.1 ).  Guidelines for management of patients who experience specific 
adverse events are provided in Section  A15–5.1.2  and Appendix  9. 
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, 
including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of 
patients during the study.   
Administration of study treatment will be performed in a monitored setting in which 
there is immed iate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment and medicine to 
manage potentially serious reactions.  Adverse events will be reported as described in 
Sections 5.25.6. 
A15–5.1.1  Risks Associated with RO7247669  
Clinical evaluation of RO7247669 is ongoing, and not all risks are known.  As an 
antagonist of PD -1 and LAG -3, RO7247669 is anticipated to enhance T -cell and 
NK-cell proliferation, survival, and function.  Based on the mechanism -of-action of 
RO7247669, the safety profile is anticipated to be similar to other CPIs.  Potential risks 
associated with RO7247669 include the following:  IRRs (including anaphylaxis), 
immunogenicity, and immune -mediated adverse events.  Refer to Section  6 of the 
RO7247669 Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks 
for RO7247669.  
A15–5.1.1.1  Infusion -Related Reactions and Anaphylaxis  
Administration of therapeutic a ntibodies may cause IRRs, which may include 
symptoms such as fever, chills, hypotension, shortness of breath, skin rash, headache, 
nausea, and vomiting.  Such reactions typically occur during or shortly after the 
infusion and are predominantly reported fol lowing the first infusion.  The incidence 
and severity of IRRs typically decrease with subsequent infusions.  Based on in vitro 
data, the risk of proinflammatory cytokine -mediated IRRs on first administration of 
RO7247669 as a single agent is considered lo w. 
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
318/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Refer to Section  A15–4.1.2  for detailed guidance on administration of RO7247669 in 
this study.  Refer to Appendix  8 for guidance on anaphylaxis precautions and to 
Section  A15–5.1.2.3  for guidance on the manageme nt of IRRs.  
A15–5.1.1.2  Immunogenicity  
Administration of therapeutic antibodies may cause the formation of anti -drug 
antibodies, which may negatively affect the safety of the therapeutic (e.g., allergic 
reactions, immune complex -mediated diseases).  
A15–5.1.1.3  Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
The co -stimulatory action of RO7247669, in particular its effects on LAG -3, may lead 
to an exaggerated risk of immune cell activation that may result in the occurrence of 
enhanced, untoward, immune -mediated adverse events and increased 
cytok ine release -mediated toxicities.  
Toxicities from PD -1 blocking agents can involve any organ or tissue, although some 
immune -mediated adverse events occur much more frequently than others.  The most 
frequently occurring immune -mediated adverse events affect  skin, colon, endocrine 
organs, liver, and lungs.  Others are very infrequent but may be very serious, even 
lethal, such as neurological disorders and myocarditis.  
The limited data from recent early phase studies showed anti LAG -3 therapy was 
generally wel l tolerated as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies, 
and data were consistent with the safety profiles of other CPIs (Ascierto et  al. 2017; 
Hong et al. 2018).  
In this study, specified immune -mediated adverse events will be considered ad verse 
events of special interest and will be captured accordingly (see Section  A15–5.2 for the 
list of adverse events of special interest and Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  
Patients with a history of autoimmune disease will  be excluded from this study.   Please 
see Section  4.1.2  for details.  
A15–5.1.2  Management of Patients Who Experience Specific Adverse 
Events in RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
A15–5.1.2.1  Dose Modifications  
There will be no dose modifications for RO7247669 in this study.  
A15–5.1.2.2  Treatment Interruption for Toxicities  
RO7247669 treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxicity 
considered to be related to study treatment.  I f corticosteroids are initiated for 
treatment of the toxicity, they must be tapered over   1 month to   10 mg/day oral 
prednisone or equivalent before RO7247669 can be resumed if warranted.  In the  
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
319/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  neoadjuvant setting, the study treatment is limited to a pre-surgery window of 6 weeks.  
Treatment during this period should not be interrupted, unless a patient experiences 
toxicity.  If toxicity meets criteria for interrupting/withholding RO7247669, 
RO7247669 should be interrupted/withheld.  After resolution o f the toxicity, 
subsequent treatment cycles should only be considered if the benefit -risk profile is 
acceptable and if the surgery can be conducted within 2 weeks of the planned date.  
Otherwise, subsequent treatment cycles should be omitted to allow the p atient to 
proceed directly to surgery without further delay.  
A15–5.1.2.3  Management Guidelines for Adverse Events  
Guidelines for management of patients who experience specific adverse events are 
provided in  Table  A15-3.

Event  Action to Be Taken  
IRRs, anaphylaxis, and hypersensitivity reactions  
General guidance   For anaphylaxis precautions, see Appendix  8. 
 For severe hypersensitivity reactions, permanently discontinue RO7247669.  
 For suspected CRS,  see Appendix  9 for guidance on supportive care . 
 Determine tryptase concentration and IgE titer if clinical presentation of IRR suggests an anaphylactic 
or hypersensitivity reaction (hives, obstructive shortness of breath, urticaria, other histamine 
associated symptoms) and/or if the first IRR or CRS (   Grade 2) is observed at the second infusion.  
If tryptase and/or IgE are elevated, coll ect a second sample for IgE/tryptase analysis at least 48  hours 
after the onset  of the reaction to rule out the possibility of an anaphylactic reaction.   
IRR to RO7247669, Grade 1 or 2   Slow infusion to   50% or interrupt infusion.  
 Give supportive treatme nt.  Patients should be treated with acetaminophen/paracetamol and an 
antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine, if they have not been administered in the last 4 hours.  
IV fluids (e.g., normal saline) may be administered as clinically indicated.  For broncho spasm, 
urticaria, or dyspnea, antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg IV prednisolone or 
equivalent), and/or bronchodilators may be administered per institutional practice.  
 Upon symptom resolution, infusion may resume (if interrupted) at 50% starting rate.  The infusion 
must remain at the lower rate resulting in symptom resolution for the remainder of the infusion.  
 For Grade 2 IRRs, subsequent doses of RO7247669 should be administered with pre -medication, 
including acetaminophen/paracetamol an d an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine.  
 For Grade 2 wheezing or urticaria, patient must also be pre -medicated prior to subsequent doses 
(as described above).  
 If symptoms recur with the same or greater severity following the slower or interrupted infusion, the 
infusion must be stopped immediately.  No further RO7247669 will be administered for the cycle.

600 mg ARM (IMMEDIATELY RE PORTABLE TO THE 
SPONSOR)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; 
see Section 5.2.3  for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for the 
RO7247669  600 mg  arm are as follows:  
 Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST 
in combination with either elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
Hy's Law (see Section  5.3.5.7 ) 
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study treatment, as defined 
below:  
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only  
when a contamination of study  treatment is suspected.  
 
A15–5.3 REPORTING REQUIREMEN TS FOR PREGNANCIES I N 
RO7247669  600 mg  ARM  
A15–5.3.1  Pregnancies in Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Informed 
Consent Form to immediately inform the investigator if  they become pregnant during 
the study or within 4 months after the final dose of RO7247669.  A paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its 
designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after le arning of the pregnancy), 
either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email 
address provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study treatme nt and counsel the 
patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  
Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any 
serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event  in the fetus, an 
event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition, the 
investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated 
information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When 
permitted by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health 
Information  would need to be signed by one or both parents (as per local regulations) to 
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
323/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  allow for follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's 
health status at birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form.  In addition, the Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant's 
health status at 6 and 12  months after birth.  
A15–5.3.2  Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients  
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
infor m the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 
4 months after the final dose of RO7247669.  The investigator should report the 
pregnancy on the  paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit the form 
to the Spons or or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax 
number or email address provided to investigators.  Attempts should be made to collect 
and rep ort details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male 
patient exposed to study treatment.  When permitted by the site, the pregnant partner 
would need to sign an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health 
Informa tion to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy.  If the authorization has been 
signed, the investigator should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form with 
additional information on the pregnant partner and the course and outcome of the 
pregnancy as  it becomes available.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When 
permitted by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health 
Information would need to be signed by one or both parents (as per loc al regulations) to 
allow for follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's 
health status at birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form.  In addition, the Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant's 
health status at 6 and 12  months after birth.  
An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may 
provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, 
to support an informed d ecision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or 
obstetrician.  
A15–5.3.3  Abortions  
A spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as  the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section 5.2.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal 
or embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event,  
Appendix 15:  Study Details Specific to RO7247669 600 mg Arm  
  
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
324/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.2.2 ).  A therapeu tic or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.  
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
A15–5.3.4  Congen ital Anomalies/Birth Defects  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to 
study treatment or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study treatment 
should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of

329/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  f After initiation of study treatment, all  adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation 
of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first,  and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will continue to 
be reported until 135 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first.  After this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  In addition, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator 
becomes aware of any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior exposure to study treatment (see Section 5.6).  For details on 
reporting all treatment -related non -serious adverse events that lead to surgical delay, see Section  5.6.  The investigator should follow each 
adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to 
follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be rela ted to study 
treatment or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
g Regardles s of whether they complete the study drug treatment period or discontinue study drug prematurely, patients who proceed to sur gery 
will have their first long -term follow -up visit 3 months after surgery and patients who do not proceed to surgery will have th eir first long -
term follow -up visit 3 months after the final dose of study treatment.  Information on long -term follow -up and new anti -cancer therapy 
(including targeted therapy and immunotherapy) will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical reco rds, and/or clinic visits 
approximately every 3 months until death (unless the patient withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study).  If a pa tient requests 
to be withdrawn from follow -up, this request must be documented in the source documents an d signed by the investigator.  If a patient 
withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., county records) to obtain information ab out survival 
status only.  For an experimental arm in which all patients discontinued t reatment and passed the safety follow -up window, as well as 
approximately 80% of patients discontinued the study, the Sponsor may conclude the arm (the remaining ~20% of patients will b e 
discontinued from the study).  
h Laboratory tests must be performed wi thin 72 hours prior to dosing during the treatment period.   If screening laboratory assessments were 
performed within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1, they do not have to be repeated.  
i At the pre -surgery visit, adrenocorticotropic hormone , cortisol, S1 00, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate will be included in the chemistry 
panel.  
j This is only applicable if elevated levels of cardiac enzymes were detected in previous assessments.  
k If periods are missed or delayed before the 6 -month follow -up visit, pregnancy testing should be repeated.  This test can be performed by a 
local gynecologist.  
l The Cycle 2 Day 1 on -treatment tissue sample must be collected up to 72 hours prior to drug administration.

335/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A16–1 BACKGROUND ON RO7247 669 600 mg  TIRA ARM  
A16–1.1 BACKGROUND ON RO7247 669 
RO7247669 is a novel, Fc -silent IgG1 -based bispecific antibody (bsAb) in 1   1 format 
that incorporates monovalent binding to two immune checkpoint proteins:  PD -1 and 
LAG -3.  RO7247669 is designed to target dysfunctional tumor antigen -specific 
T lymphocytes expressing PD -1 and LAG -3 to establish or re -establish an effective 
anti-tumor immune response in cancer patients.  This may result in improved 
therapeutic responses over currently available therapies.  In addition, RO7247669 is 
engineered to prevent binding to Fc gamma receptors, thu s potentially avoiding 
tumor -associated macrophage resistance mechanisms.  Such mechanisms have been 
observed with IgG4 -based anti PD-1 antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
(Arlauckas et al. 2017).  Clinical evaluation of RO7247669 is ongoing in  a 
first -in-human, dose -finding study (Study NP41300), as a single agent in cancer 
patients with and without prior CPI exposure.   
Refer to the RO7247669 Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinical and  other 
planned and ongoing clinical  studies.  
A16–1.2 BAC KGROUND ON TIRAGOLUM AB 
Tiragolumab is a fully human IgG1/kappa monoclonal antibody that binds TIGIT and 
prevents its interaction with CD155 (also known as poliovirus receptor [PVR]).  
Therapeutic blockade of TIGIT by tiragolumab represents an attractive st rategy for 
cancer therapy and is expected to enhance the magnitude and quality of tumor -specific 
T-cell responses.  This may result in improved meaningful anti -tumor activity when 
tiragolumab is used in combination with other cancer immunotherapies and 
administered with chemotherapy.  The available nonclinical and clinical data provide a 
strong rationale for evaluating the potential clinical benefit of tiragolumab in cancer 
patients.  
Refer to the Tiragolumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on nonclinica l and 
clinical  studies.  
A16–2 RATIONALE FOR RO7247 669 600 mg  TIRA ARM  
A16–2.1 TARGETING THE PD -1 AND LAG -3 ANTIGENS  
Cancer immunotherapy agents, particularly immune CPIs, have had a significant 
impact on the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies in recent years.  
However, despite the remarkable clinical efficacy of these therapies, additional 
treatment options targeting immune checkpoints are needed, because the majority of 
patients eventually progress after an initial response or fail to respond to the 
PD-1/PD -L1 checkpoint blockade.  This is believed to be mainly due to primary or 
Appendix 1 6:  Study Details Specifi c to RO7247669 600 mg   Tira A rm 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
336/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  secondary resistance mechanisms, immunosuppressive activity of myeloid -derived 
suppressor cells and/or T -regulatory cells (Sharma et al. 2017).  
To overcome resistance mechanisms,  additional treatment options and multiple 
combinations with anti PD-L1 are being assessed.  One potential reason for resistance 
to antiPD-L1 therapy is the upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints with 
non-redundant regulatory functions (Sharma et al. 2017).  LAG -3 is one such 
alternative immune checkpoint.  Structurally similar to CD4, LAG -3 is a member of the 
Ig superfamily.  LAG -3 is expressed on activated effector T cells and is constitutively 
expressed on T -regulatory cells and natural killer ( NK)  cells.  The expression of both 
PD-1 and LAG -3 on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) correlates with the degree of 
impairment of effector functions, which is associated with poor prognosis 
(Matsuzaki  et al. 2010; Baitsch et al. 2011; Thommen et al. 2015).  Hence, LAG -3 is a 
marker of T -cell dysfunctionality.  LAG -3 also regulates T -cell functions, presumably 
including the function of T -regulatory cells.  In chronic infections and cancer, LAG -3, 
together with PD -1, contributes to T -cellacquired dysfunctionality and to the inability 
of T cells to mount an effective/protective immune response upon interaction with the 
LAG -3 ligand, MHC -II. 
The interaction of LAG -3 with MHC -II inhibits T -cell proliferation, activation, 
cytolytic function, and proinflammatory cytokine production (Goldberg and Drake 
2011).  The  effect of LAG -3 expression on T -regulatory cells is controversial.  An early 
report concluded that LAG -3 promotes T-regulatory cell -mediated immune suppression  
(Camisaschi et al. 2010).  However, a more recent report from the same authors  found 
that LAG -3 limits T-regulatory cell -mediated immune suppression (Zhang et al. 2017).  
Expression of LAG -3 has been reported across various tumor types, including breast 
cancer, ovarian cancer, non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, renal cell 
cancer (RCC), prostate cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  In patients with 
these tumor types, LAG -3 is associated with poor prognosis (Matsuzaki et al. 2010; 
Baitsch et al. 2011; Thommen et al. 2015; He et al. 2016; Norstrom et al. 2016).  
Clinic al evaluation of anti LAG -3 agents, as a single -agent and in combination with 
other CPIs, is ongoing in several early phase studies in patients with advanced solid 
tumors (Long  et al. 2018).  Preliminary data demonstrate that anti LAG -3 therapy is 
well tol erated, both as a single agent and in combination with anti PD-1 therapies, and 
the safety profiles were consistent with those of other CPIs (Ascierto et al. 2017; 
Hong  et al. 2018; Stratton  et al. 2018).  RO7247669 therefore has the potential to be a 
therapeutic option for patients with melanoma.  
Resistance to PD -L1/PD -1 blockade may result in the expression of multiple 
co-inhibitory immune checkpoints on the surface of effector T cells.  LAG -3 is 
frequently co -expressed with PD -1 on TILs, and dual blockad e of PD -1 and LAG -3 
Appendix 1 6:  Study Details Specifi c to RO7247669 600 mg   Tira A rm 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
337/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  enhances CD8    T-cell effector function and potentiates anti -tumor immunity in 
nonclinical models.  Blockade of these two receptors in mice with colon, fibrosarcoma, 
or ovarian tumors resulted in tumor remission in approximately 80% of  animals 
compared with 10% to 40% with blockade of either receptor using a single agent 
(Woo  et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2015).  TILs from patients with ovarian cancer showed 
that antigen -specific CD8    T cells co -expressing PD -1 and LAG -3 exhibited greater  
impairment in their ability to respond to cognate antigen stimulation compared with 
CD8   T cells that expressed one checkpoint molecule (Matsuzaki et al. 2010).  
In patients with NSCLC, overexpression of LAG -3 on TILs correlated with 
PD-1/PD -L1 expressio n and was linked to higher risk of recurrence and poor survival 
outcomes (He  et al. 2017).  
A16–2.2 THE TIGIT PATHWAY  
TIGIT is an immune inhibitory receptor that is a member of the immunoglobulin 
superfamily (Yu et al. 2009 ).  TIGIT is expressed on the surface of activated T cell and 
NK cell subsets and interacts with high affinity with CD155 (also known as PVR) 
(Yu et al. 2009 ).  Genetic ablation of TIGIT in T cells in mice results in exacerbated 
T-cell responses in nonclinical models of autoimmune and viral infections, 
demonstrating the role of TIGIT in inhibiting T -cell responses (Joller et al. 2011 ; 
Johnston et al. 2014 ).  TIGIT expression is elevated in the tumor microenvironment in 
many human tumors, is concordantly expressed with other checkpoint 
immune -receptors such as PD -1 on the surface of T  cells, and is associated with 
impaired T -cell function and anti -tumor immunity (Johnston et al. 2014 ; 
Manieri  et al. 2017 ).  Activation of TIGIT on T cells and NK cells limits cellular 
proliferation, effector cyto kine production, and killing of target tumor cells 
(Stanietsky  et al. 2009; Yu  et al. 2009; Johnston et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2015 ; 
Manieri  et al. 2017 ). 
TIGIT is expressed in a wide variety of human tumors.  It is expressed in most solid 
tumors, such as N SCLC, breast cancer, and melanoma, as well as in hematological 
tumors, such as multiple myeloma (MM) and non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).  
Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis of T cells isolated from fresh tumor samples 
revealed that TIGIT and PD -1 are also co -expressed on tumor -infiltrating T cells 
(Johnston et al. 2014; Yadav  et al. 2016 ; Yang 2016 ; Guillerey et al. 2018 ).  TIGIT was 
expressed in 30% 80% of tumor -infiltrating  CD4+ T cells and in 50% 80% of 
tumor -infiltrating  CD8    T cells (Johnston  et al. 2014).  
Therefore, TIGIT is a potential target for therapeutic interventions that aim to restore 
the immune response against the tumor.  Agents that inhibit TIGIT’s interaction with 
PVR may inhibit an important source of tumor -associated immune suppression, thereby 
enhancing the activity of other immune -based therapies.  Nonclinical studies using 
genetically deficient mice and blocking antibodies have revealed a key role for TIGIT in 
Appendix 1 6:  Study Details Specifi c to RO7247669 600 mg   Tira A rm 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
338/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  regulating T -cell responses in cancer.  Taken together, these d ata support the 
hypothesis that anti -TIGIT therapy may reactivate anti -tumor immunity and provide 
clinical benefits to patients with cancer.  
A16–2.3 COMBINATION TREATMEN T WITH ANTI PD-1/ 
ANTILAG -3 AND ANTI -TIGIT  AGENTS  
Durable clinical benefit is limited to a min ority of patients treated with single -agent 
PD-L1/PD -1 inhibitors.  Therapies targeting the mechanisms of resistance to 
anti-PD-L1/PD -1 therapies are needed to improve outcomes in patients with solid 
cancers.  Resistance to PD -L1/PD -1 blockade may result i n the expression of multiple 
co-inhibitory receptors on the surface of effector T cells including TIGIT and LAG -3.  
Nonclinical tumor models have shown that TIGIT selectively suppressed the effector 
function of chronically stimulated CD8   T cells, and th at inhibiting both TIGIT and 
PD-L1/PD -1 resulted in superior efficacy compared with single -agent treatments 
(Johnston  et al. 2014).  Similarly, in -vivo proof -of-concept studies using different 
tumor mouse models have shown PD1 -LAG -3 bsAbs to be superior in  controlling tumor 
growth and promoting tumor eradication when compared with anti -PD-1 antibodies as 
monotherapy.  Hence, targeting PD -1/LAG -3 and TIGIT with RO7247669 and 
tiragolumab, respectively, may enhance the efficacy of PD -L1/PD -1 blockade across 
different cancer types, including melanoma.  
A16–2.4 CLINICAL STUDIES  OF AGENTS TARGETING  THE PD -1 
AND LAG -3 PATHWAYS  
Clinical data are available for early - and late - phase studies that evaluated the safety, 
tolerability, and preliminary anti -tumor activity of agents  that target both the PD -1 
and LAG -3 pathways.  Evidence of clinical activity has been reported in some of these 
studies.  Overall, adverse events have been manageable to date, and the safety profiles 
appear similar to those of single -agent CPIs.  
An ongoin g Phase I/IIa study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity 
of combination treatment with the anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab and the 
antiLAG -3 monoclonal antibody relatlimab in patients with advanced solid tumors.  
Prelimina ry data suggest that the combination of nivolumab and relatlimab may have 
an increased benefit compared with single -agent anti PD-1.  In a cohort of patients 
who had advanced melanoma who were previously treated with anti PD-1/PD -L1 
agents, the objective r esponse rate (ORR) was 11.5% (n   61) with a disease control rate 
of 49%.  The anti PD-1/PD -L1 treatment combination had an acceptable safety profile 
that was  similar to the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy (Ascierto et al. 2017).  
Relativity -047 is a Phase III study evaluating the combination of nivolumab 
(antiPD-1) and relatlimab (anti LAG -3) versus nivolumab alone in patients with 
untreated advanced melanoma.  This study demonstrated that  nivolumab and relatlimab 
Appendix 1 6:  Study Details Specifi c to RO7247669 600 mg   Tira A rm 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
339/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  improved progres sion-free survival (PFS   10.1 months) over nivolumab 
(PFS    4.6 months).   The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related adverse events 
was 18.9% in patients that received the  nivolumab and relatlimab combination and 
9.7% in patients that received nivolumab  alonoe (Tawbi et al. 2022).    
An ongoing Phase I/II study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity 
of combination treatment with the anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody spartalizumab and 
the antiLAG -3 monoclonal antibody LAG525 in  patients with advanced solid tumors.  
Preliminary anti -tumor activity was observed during the Phase I dose -escalation 
portion of the study, including durable responses in 2 of 5  patients with triple -negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) and in 2  of 8 patients wit h mesothelioma.  Analyses of tumor 
biopsies from the TNBC cohort also showed a trend of conversion from an immune -cold 
to an immune -activated phenotype.  Common adverse events, i.e., adverse events 
reported in   10% of patients, included fatigue (18%), dia rrhea (15%), and nausea 
(12%).  The  incidence of Grade 3 4 adverse events was 8% for both the combination 
(n   121) and monotherapy (n   119) arms (Hong et al. 2018).  
An ongoing, first -in-human, dose -escalation, and dose -expansion Phase I study is 
evaluati ng the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the anti PD-1/LAG -3 dual 
affinity re -targeting protein (DART®) bsAb MGD013 in patients with advanced solid 
tumors and hematologic malignancies.  During the dose -escalation phase of the study, 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached, and the safety profile was 
consistent with anti PD-1 monotherapy.  During the dose -expansion phase, anti -tumor 
activity was observed in patients with TNBC (n   23; ORR, 4.3%; disease control rate 
[DCR], 39.1%),  CPI-naive NSCLC (n   14; ORR, 14.3%; DCR, 64.3%), and epithelial 
ovarian cancer (n   23; ORR, 8.7%; DCR, 52.2%).  Expression of LAG -3 and an IFN - 
gene signature at baseline was associated with objective responses (Luke et al. 2020).  
Clinical studies eva luating MGD013 as monotherapy and in combination with 
antiHER -2 agents are  ongoing.  
A16–2.4.1  Study NP41300  
Study NP41300 is an ongoing, first -in-human, dose -escalation, dose -expansion Phase I 
study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic activity  of the 
antiPD-1/LAG -3 bsAb RO7247669 as a single -agent in patients with locally advanced

designed to determine the MTD and/or recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of 
RO72 47669.  Part B of the study is designed to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of 
RO7247669 at the MTD or RDE in tumor -specific expansion cohorts.  
As of the data cut -off date, 1 March 202 2, RO7247669 was well tolerated in the 
patients enrolled in Part A of the study.  No unexpected safety concern associated with 
RO7247669 was identified.  No dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed up to the

The maximum dose of 2100 mg was determined to be the recommended dose for the 
dose -expansion phase (Part B) of Study NP41300.   As of the data cutoff date, 
1 March  2022, 83 patients received treatment in  Part B.  
As of the data cut -off date, 1 March 202 2, the DCR in Part A of the study was 51.4% 
(18 of 35 evaluable patients), and the ORR was 17.1% (6 of 35 patients).  Among the 
patients treated with the proposed dose of 2100 mg Q2W, 7 of 13 patients had a best 
response of st able disease or better (DCR   53.8%), including 4 patients with a 
confirmed partial response (PR, ORR   30.8%) .  Besides the confirmed partial responses 
(cPR) observed at the RDE , there were 2 cPRs at the 600 mg dose level (ORR   50.0%).  
As of the data  cut-off date,  1 March 2022, in Part B of the study the DCR was 48.3% 
(28 of 58  patients) and the ORR was 5.2% (3 of 58 patients)  among patients of the 
study treated at the RDE of 2100 mq Q2W ( Cohort s B1, B2 , and B3).  Within patients 
treated with 600 mg Q 2W ( Cohort B5), the DCR was 40% (4 of  10 patients), and the 
ORR was 10% (1 of 10 patients). Among patients treated with 600 mg Q3W, the DCR 
was 28.6% (2 of 7 patients) and the ORR was 14.3% (1 of 7 patients).

A16–2.5 CLINICAL STUDIES OF TIRAGOLUMAB  
Tiragolumab is currently under investigation in two ongoing clinical studies in 
patients with solid tumors (Studies GO30103 and GO40290) and in one clinical  study 
in patients with hematological malignancies (Study GO41036).  
A16–2.5.1  Study GO30103  
Study GO30103 is a first -in-human, open -label, multicenter, global, 
dose -escalation/dose -expansion Phase I study.  It was designed to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and p harmacokinetics of tiragolumab as a single agent (Phase Ia) and in 
combination with atezolizumab (Phase Ib) in patients with locally advanced, recurrent, 
or metastatic incurable tumors, including urothelial cancer, renal cell cancer, NSCLC, 
head and neck s quamous cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), 
gastric cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and triple -negative breast cancer.  
As of the clinical cutoff date of 2 December 2020, a total of 236 patients had been 
enrolled in Study GO30103.  Forty -two patients were enrolled in the Phase Ia portion 
of the study to receive single -agent tiragolumab, and 217 patients were enrolled in the 
Phase Ib portion of the study to receive tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab.  
The latter group included 23  patients who crossed over from the Phase Ia portion of 
the study.

341/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  The best observed response with tiragolumab monotherapy in the Phase Ia portion was 
prolonged stable disease in 8 of 42 patients, with some patients, including 1 patient 
with CRC, experiencing a decrease in tumor size.  
In the Phase Ib portion, complete response was observed in 4 of 217 patients at 
tiragolumab dose levels of 400 mg (n   3/48) and 600 mg (n    1/104) in combination 
with 1200 mg atezolizumab.  Partial response was observed in 27   of 217 patients at 
tiragolumab dose levels of 30 mg (n   2/13), 400  mg (n   6/48), and 600 mg (n   18/104) 
in combination with 1200 mg atezolizumab, including two patients who crossed over 
from the Phase Ia portion at the 600 mg dose level.   Stable disease was observed in 53  of 
217 patients at tiragolumab dose levels of 2  mg (n   1/8), 8  mg (n   3/12), 30 mg 
(n    2/13), 100 mg (n    3/8), 400 mg (n   12/48), 600 mg (n   25/104), and 1200 mg 
(n   7/24) in combination with 1200  mg atezolizuma b, including 8 patients who crossed 
over from the Phase Ia portion of the study (2  patients at 8 mg, 1 patient at 30 mg, 
2 patients at 100 mg, and 3 patients at 400  mg).  
As of 2 December 2020, safety data were available for 235 safety -evaluable patients in  
Study GO30103.  A total of 42 patients were treated in the Phase Ia portion with 
tiragolumab as a single agent (2 mg to 1200 mg), while 216 patients were treated in the 
Phase Ib portion with tiragolumab at dose levels of 2  mg to 1200 mg in combination 
with atezolizumab at 1200 mg, including 23 patients who crossed over from the Phase 
Ia portion to the Phase  Ib portion.  
Tiragolumab was tolerated across all administered dose levels both as a single agent and 
in combination with atezolizumab.  The MTD was not  reached, and the maximum 
administered dose was 1200 mg.  No DLTs or clear dose -related trends in the incidence 
of adverse events were observed.  Grade   3 adverse event s, regardless of attribution to 
the study drug(s), were reported in 16 patients (38.1%)  and 113 patients (52.3%) in 
the Phase Ia and Phase  Ib portions, respectively.  There were 14 reported deaths in the 
Phase Ia portion of the study, including 12 deaths due to malignant neoplasm 
progression, 1 death due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the  context of progressive 
disease, and 1 death due to hepatic failure.  The death due to hepatic failure was 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug.  One hundred eighteen 
deaths were reported in the Phase Ib portion of the study.  This in cluded 111 deaths due 
to progressive disease (31 cases were reported as adverse event s during the adverse 
event  reporting period and coded as malignant neoplasm progression or neoplasm 
malignant), 2 deaths due to pulmonary embolism, 1  death due to esophage al 
hemorrhage, 1 death due to sepsis, 1 death due to septic shock, 1 death due to 
COVID -19, and 1 death due to upper airway obstruction.  Treatment -related serious 
adverse events were reported in 1 patient in the Phase Ia portion (hepatic failure) and 
in 10 patients (4.6%) in the Phase Ib portion.  No patient discontinued study treatment 
due to adverse event s in the Phase Ia portion of Study GO30103.  Adverse event s

portion of  the study, with a Grade 4 cardiac tamponade, a Grade 4 pneumonitis, and 
one event of Grade 2 arthralgia considered by the investigator to be related to the study 
drug(s).  Adverse events of special interest were reported in 5 patients (11.9%) in the 
Phase  Ia portion and 82 patients (38.0%) in the Phase Ib portion of the study.  
Overall, tiragolumab as a single agent or in combination with atezolizumab has been 
well tolerated, adverse events have been manageable, and the safety profile has been 
observed to b e consistent across different solid tumor indications.  
A16–2.5.2  Study GO40290  
Study GO40290 is a Phase II, randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled study of 
tiragolumab plus atezolizumab compared with placebo plus atezolizumab in patients 
with previously untreated l ocally advanced unresectable or metastatic PD -L1positive 
NSCLC (defined as tumor proportion score [TPS]    1%).  
As of the primary clinical cutoff date of 30 June 2019, 135  patients with a PD -L1 
TPS   1% were  included in the intent -to-treat (ITT) populati on and  were randomly 
assigned to receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (n   67) or placebo plus atezolizumab 
(n   68).  As  of the primary analysis, 47.8% of patients in the tiragolumab plus 
atezolizumab group versus 27.9% of patients in the placebo plus atezolizumab group 
were still receiving study treatment in the ITT population.  In the TPS   50% 
population, 65.5% of patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group versus 
24.1% of patients in the placebo plus atezolizumab group were still receiving 
study  treatment.  
In all randomized patients,  the combination of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab improved 
the co -primary endpoints of investigator -assessed ORR and progression -free survival 
(PFS) compared to placebo plus atezolizumab, with median follow -up of 5.9 months.  
ORR for tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was 31.3% (95%  CI: 19.5, 43.2) compared 
with placebo plus atezolizumab which was 16.2% (95%  CI: 6.7, 25.7).  
Investigator -assessed median PFS for tiragolumab plus atezolizumab was 5.4 months 
(95% CI: 4.2 m onths, not reached) compared with placebo plus atezolizumab which was 
3.6 months (95% CI:  2.7 months, 4.4 months), with a stratified hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.57 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.90).  Investigator -assessed PFS was improved in the tiragolumab 
plus atezolizuma b group over the placebo plus atezolizumab group (unstratified 
HR   0.33; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.72; median PFS not reached vs. 3.9 months, respectively).  
As of 2 December 2020, 67 safety -evaluable patients in the tiragolumab plus 
atezolizumab arm in Study GO4029 0 were treated with a median of 8 doses of 
tiragolumab and atezolizumab (range: 1 38) for a median of 5.0 months 
(range:  0.0326.0).  In the placebo plus atezolizumab arm, 68 safety -evaluable patients

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
343/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  were treated with a median of 5 doses of placebo and at ezolizumab (range: 1 37) for a 
median of 2.8  months (range: 0.03 26.3).  
As of 30 June 2020, in the Phase II randomized, placebo -controlled Study GO40290, 
a total of 135  safety -evaluable patients were administered either tiragolumab (600 mg 
recommended Phas e II/III dose) in combination with atezolizumab or placebo in 
combination with atezolizumab.  The safety profile of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab 
was similar to that of placebo plus atezolizumab - for all -grade adverse event s 
(98.5%  vs. 97.1%), Grade    3 adverse event s (53.7% vs. 50.0%), serious adverse event s 
(47.8% vs. 39.7%), and adverse event s leading to treatment discontinuation 
(13.4%  vs. 11.8%).  Adverse events of special interest  were reported in 58.2% of 
patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizum ab arm and in 32.4% of patients in the 
placebo plus atezolizumab arm.  One death due to Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) 
reactivation and possible secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was 
reported in this study, which was considered by the investigat or to be related to the 
study drugs.  
Overall, tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab has been well tolerated, adverse 
events have been manageable, and t he safety profile seems to be consistent as reported 
across different solid tumor indications.  
Refer to the Tiragolumab  Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on all ongoing 
and planned clinical studies.  
A16–2.6 BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT  
The combination of RO7247669 and tiragolumab is currently being tested in this study.  
The combination of atezolizumab and tiragolumab has a favorable emergent benefit risk 
profile, and early clinical experience with RO7247669 suggest a safety profile 
comparable to that of atezolizumab and other PD -1/PD -L1 blocking antibodies 
(Appendix  12).  The combination of nivolumab (anti PD-1) and relatlimab 
(antiLAG -3) improved PFS over nivolumab alone as first -line therapy in melanoma 
patients in the  Phase III Relativity -047 study ( Tawbi et al. 2022 ), which supports the 
expected benefit from RO7247669 (anti PD-1/antiLAG -3 bispecific therapy) in 
combination with tiragolumab.  Taking into account the potentially synergistic 
mechanisms of action of RO7247669 and tiragolumab, as well as their manageable and 
tolerable safety profiles (see Section  A16–5), combination treatment with these two 
agents has promise as a potential therapy in solid tumors such as melanoma.  
For the evalu ation of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the benefit risk 
assessment, please refer to Section  1.3.

A16–3.1 RATIONALE FOR RO7247 669 600 mg DOSE AND 
SCHEDULE  
RO7247669 will be administered at a fixed dose of 600 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) 
(600 mg on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle).  A fixed dosing regimen of 600 mg Q3W was 
selecte d based on available clinical pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data from 
Study NP41300.  During the dose -escalation Part A of the study, RO7247669 was well 
tolerated, and no specific safety concern associated with RO7247669 was identified.  
No DLT up to the highest dose of 2100 mg Q2W was observed, and no MTD was 
identified.  Anti -tumor activity, as measured by radiographic  partial responses , was 
observed starting at a dose of 600 mg Q2W.   The pharmacokinetics of RO7247669 were 
dose linear within the d ose range tested in Study NP41300.  Greater than 90% 
occupancy of peripheral PD -1 and LAG3 receptors on CD 8+ cells was observed at 50  mg 
of RO7247669 and was sustained at all higher doses (unpublished Roche data on file).   
Further modelling of intratumoral  PD-1 and LAG3 target engagement using estimated 
target properties was performed.  A dose regimen of 600  mg Q3W was selected for this 
study  (BO43328) to ensure that the majority of participants have at least 90% PD -1 
and LAG3 tumor receptor saturation by R O7247669, irrespective of intratumoral 
spatial heterogeneity and intersubject variability .  A dose greater than 600  mg would 
not be expected to result in further clinical activity.  
In study NP41300, persistent anti-drug antibodies ( ADAs ) formed in approximately 
18% of the total population and the incidence rate was not dose dependent.  An  impact 
on exposure was observed at 50, 150 and 300 mg ; therefore , 600 mg will be  used in 
Study  BO43328 to minimize the risk of a loss in exposure due to  ADAs.    
In addition, RO7247669 was well tolerated in both the dose -range finding studies and 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) monkey toxicology studies up to the highest dose 
evaluated (100 mg/kg).  Toxicology findings were consistent with the findings in 
cynomolgus monkey studies of marketed CPIs.   In the current study  (BO43328) , the 
safety evaluation of the first 6 patients enrolled in the RO7247669  2100  mg arm was 
completed with no safety signals identified.   
The supporting data for the selected dose can  be found in the current  RO7247669 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
A16–3.2 RATIONALE FOR TIRAGO LUMAB DOSE AND SCHED ULE  
Tiragolumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 600 mg IV Q3W (600 mg on Day  1

345/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  The fixed dose of 600 mg IV Q3W was selected on the basis of available clinical 
pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data from the combined Phase Ia/Phase Ib Study 
GO30103 with single -agent tiragolumab or tiragolumab in combination with 
atezolizumab.  In the Phase Ia portion of the study with tirago lumab as a single agent, 
the MTD was not reached, and no DLTs were observed during dose -escalation.  As of 
the clinical cutoff date, anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) to tiragolumab were rare in the 
Phase Ia or Phase Ib portions across all dose levels.  Complete  occupancy of peripheral 
TIGIT receptors on CD4   , CD8   , and NK cells was observed beginning at 30 mg of 
tiragolumab in both the Phase Ia and Phase Ib portions of the study and remained 
sustained at all higher doses (unpublished Roche data on file).  
Prolonged stable disease was observed in patients in the Phase Ia portion of the study at 
tiragolumab doses beginning at 400 mg.  In the Phase Ib portion of the study with 
tiragolumab plus atezolizumab, the MTD was not reached.  Anti -tumor activity, as 
measur ed by radiographic partial responses, was observed across doses for tiragolumab 
beginning at 30 mg and ranging up to 600 mg in combination with 1200  mg 
atezolizumab.  Refer to the Tiragolumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional details.

Appendix 1 6:  Study Details Specifi c to RO7247669 600 mg   Tira A rm 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
350/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  with RO7247669 and/or tiragolumab.  Therefore, in situations in which systemic 
corti costeroids , immunosuppressive medications,  or TNF - inhibitors would be 
routinely administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered.  
If the alternatives are not feasible, systemic corticosteroids , immunosuppressive 
medications,  and TNF - inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
Systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications, are recommended, at the 
discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events when 
associated  with RO7247669 and/or tiragolumab therapy (refer to  Appendix  9 for 
details) . 
A16–4.2.2.2  Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug -drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer 
(see Section  A16–4.2.2 ) may be used during the study at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
A16–4.2.3  Prohibited Therapy for RO7247669  600 mg   Tira  Arm  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not 
limited to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and 
herbal therapy), whether health auth orityapproved or experimental, is prohibited 
for various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent 
(see Section 4.4), and during study treatment until surgery, or unacceptable 
toxicity .   
 Investigational therapy is prohibited within 28 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment and during study treatment.  
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g.,  FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment, during treatment with RO7247669 and/or 
tiragolumab, and for 4  months after the last dose of RO7247669 and/or 
tiragolumab.  
 Systemic immunostimul atory agents (including, but not limited to, interferons and 
interleukin -2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 half -lives of the drug (whichever 
is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment 
because these agents could potenti ally increase the risk for autoimmune conditions 
when given in combination with RO7247669 and/or tiragolumab.

351/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  A16–4.3 CONTRACEPTION REQUIR EMENTS FOR  RO7247669  
600 mg  TIRA ARM  
Contraception requirements for women and men in the RO7247669  600 mg   Tira arm 
are outlined below:  
 For women of childbearing potential:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, as defined below:  
Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate 
of  1% per year during the treatment period, for 4 months after the last dose of 
RO7247669, and for 90 days after the last dose of tiragolumab.  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, 
has not reached a postmenopausal state (   12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is not 
permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, 
and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by the investigator 
(e.g.,  Mülleria n agenesis).  The definition of childbearing potential may be 
adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.  
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of   1% per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle  of the 
patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  If  required per local guidelines or regulations, locally 
recognized acceptable methods o f contraception and information about the 
reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.  
 For men:  agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or 
use contraception, and agreement to refrain from do nating sperm, as defined below:  
With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant or a 
pregnant female partner, men who are not surgically sterile must remain 
abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that 
together  result in a failure rate of   1% per year during the treatment period, 
for 4  months after the last dose of RO7247669, and for 90 days after the last 
dose of tiragolumab to avoid exposing the embryo.  Men must refrain from 
donating sperm during this same p eriod.

A16–5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  FOR RO7247669  600 mg  TIRA 
ARM  
A16–5.1 SAFETY PLAN FOR RO72 47669  600 mg  TIRA ARM  
The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with 
RO7247669 and tiragolumab in completed and ongoing studies.  The anticipated 
important safety risks are outlined below (see Sections   A16–5.1.1 , A16–5.1.2 , A16–
5.1.3 , and A16–5.1.4 ).  Guidelines for the management of patients who experience 
specific adverse events are provided in Section   A16–5.1.4  and Appendix  9. 
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, 
including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and close monitoring of 
patients du ring the study.    
Administration of RO7247669 and tiragolumab will be performed in a monitored 
setting in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment 
and medicine to manage potentially serious reactions.  Adverse events will  be reported 
as described in Sections 5.25.6. 
A16–5.1.1  Risks Associated with RO7247669  
Clinical evaluation of RO7247669 is ongoing, and not all risks are known.  As an 
antagonist of PD -1 and LAG -3, RO7247669 is anticipated to enhance T -cell and 
NK-cell proliferation, survival, and function.  Based on the mechanism -of-action of 
RO7247669, the safety profile is anticipated to be similar to other CPIs.  Potential risks 
associated with RO7247669 include the following:  IRRs (including anaphylaxis), 
immunogenicity, and immune -mediated adverse events.  Refer to Section  6 of the 
RO7247669 Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks 
for RO7247669.  
A16–5.1.1.1  Infusion -Related Reactions and Anaphylaxis  
Administration of therapeutic antibodies may cause IRRs, which may include 
symptoms such as fever, chills, hypotension, shortness of breath, skin rash, headache, 
nausea, and vomiting.  Such reactions typically occur during or shortly after the 
infusion and are predominantly reported fo llowing the first infusion.  The incidence 
and severity of IRRs typically decrease with subsequent infusions.  Based on in vitro 
Appendix 1 6:  Study Details Specifi c to RO7247669 600 mg   Tira A rm 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
353/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  data, the risk of proinflammatory cytokine -mediated IRRs on first administration of 
RO7247669 as single agent is considered low . 
Refer to Section   A16–4.1.2  for detailed guidance on administration of RO7247669 in 
this study.  Refer to Appendix  8 for guidance on anaphylaxis precautions and 
Section  A16–5.1.4.3  for guidance on the management of IRRs.  
A16–5.1.1.2  Immunogenicity  
Administration of therapeutic antibodies may cause the formation of anti -drug 
antibodies, which may negatively affect the safety of the therapeutic (e.g., allergic 
reactions, immune complex -mediated diseases).  
A16–5.1.1.3  Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
The co -stimulatory action of RO7247669, particularly given the LAG -3 modulation, 
might bear the risk of e xaggerated immune cell activation that may result in the 
occurrence of enhanced, untoward, immune -mediated adverse events and increased 
cytokine -releasemediated toxicities.  
Toxicities from PD -1 blocking agents can involve any organ or tissue, although som e 
immune -mediated adverse events occur much more frequently than others.  The most 
frequently occurring immune -mediated adverse events affect skin, colon, endocrine 
organs, liver, and lungs.  Others are very infrequent but may be very serious, even 
lethal,  such as neurological disorders and myocarditis.  
The limited data from recent early phase studies showed that anti LAG -3therapy was 
generally well tolerated as a monotherapy or in combination with antiPD-1 therapies, 
and consistent with the safety profile s of other CPIs (Ascierto et  al. 2017; 
Hong  et al. 2018).  
In this study, specified immune -mediated adverse events will be considered adverse 
events of special interest and will be captured accordingly (see Section  A16–5.2 for the 
list of adverse events of special interest and Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  
Patients with a history of autoimmune disease will be excluded from this study.  
Please  see Section  4.1.2  for details.  
A16–5.1.2  Risks Associated with Tiragolumab  
Infusion -related reactions and immune -mediated hepatitis are identified risks of 
tiragolumab.  Lymphopenia is a potential risk with tiragolumab.  Although clinical 
evaluation of tiragolumab is limited and not all risks are known, as an antagonist of 
TIGIT, tiragolumab is anticipated to enhance T -cell and NK -cell proliferation, survival, 
and function.  Therefore, tiragolumab may increase the risk of  autoimmune 
inflammation (also described as immune -mediated adverse events).   
Appendix 1 6:  Study Details Specifi c to RO7247669 600 mg   Tira A rm 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
354/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  Refer to Appendix  9 of the protocol and  the Tiragolumab Investigator’s Brochure for a 
detailed description of anticipated safety risks of tiragolumab . 
A16–5.1.2.1  Infusion -Related Reactions  
Because tiragolumab is a th erapeutic monoclonal antibody and targets immune cells, 
IRRs associated with hypersensitivity reactions, and/or target -mediated cytokine release  
may occur.  Clinical signs and symptoms of such reactions may include rigors, chills, 
wheezing, pruritus, flush ing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever.  
IRRs have been reported in patients treated with tiragolumab.  The majority of events 
were mild to moderate and manageable.  
To minimize the risk and sequelae of IRRs, the initial dose of tiragolumab will be 
administered over 60 minutes followed by a 60 -minute observation period.  Subsequent 
infusions and observation times may be shortened  if the preceding infusion was  well 
tolerated.  All infusions will be administered in an appropriate medical setting.  
Refer to Section  A16–4.1.2  for detailed guidance on administration of tiragolumab in 
this study.  Please see Appendix  8 for guidance on anaphylaxis precautions and  
Table  A16-4 for guidance on the management of IRRs.  
A16–5.1.2.2  Immune -Mediated Hepatitis  
The use of tiragolumab to block the immune inhibitory receptor TIGIT serves to 
increase a baseline T -cell and NK-cell immune response, especially in combination with 
other checkpoint inhibitors.  A disruption in the functioning of immune checkpoint 
molecules may lead to imbalances in immunologic tolerance that results in an 
unchecked immune response, including imm une-mediated hepatitis.  
Refer to Appendix  9 for guidance on the management of immune -mediated hepatitis.  
A16–5.1.2.3  Immune -Mediated Adverse Events  
Nonclinical models have suggested a role of TIGIT signaling interruption in 
autoimmunity.  In a knockout model (TIGIT /), loss of TIGIT signaling resulted in 
hyperproliferative T -cell responses and exacerbation of experimental autoimmune 
encephalitis (EAE).  TIGIT / and wild -type B6 mice were immunized with myelin 
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide in an EAE using suboptimal doses.  In contrast to 
the wild -type B6 mice, the majority of the TIGIT / mice developed severe EAE 
(Joller  et al. 2011).  
Clinical experience with therapeutics intended to enhance anti -tumor T -cell responses 
has demonstrated that development of autoimmune inflammatory conditions is a 
general risk and may therefore be considered a potential risk of tiragolumab.  
Such  immune -mediated adverse events have been described for virtually all organ 
Appendix 1 6:  Study Details Specifi c to RO7247669 600 mg   Tira A rm 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
355/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  systems and include, but are not limited to, colitis, pneumonitis, endocrinopath ies, 
ocular toxicity, pancreatic toxicity, neurologic toxicity, cardiac toxicity , nephritis, 
myositi s, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions . 
Patients with a history of autoimmune disease will be excluded from this study 
(see Section  4.1.2 ). 
In this study, immune -mediated adverse events will be considered adverse events of 
special interest and will be captured accordingly (see Section  A16–5.2 for the list of 
adverse events of special interest and Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  
Suggested management guidelines for individual  suspected immune -mediated adverse 
events are provided in Appendix  9. 
A16–5.1.2.4  Lymphopenia  
The IgG1 backbone of tiragolumab with intact Fc -effector function may lead to  
ADCC -mediated reduction in lymphocyte count.  Lymphopenia is a potential risk with 
tiragolumab .  Transient decreases in  lymphocyte count without clinical sequelae have 
been observed in patients treated with tiragolumab.  
Patients with a lymphocyte count   0.5   109/L (500/L) will be excluded from the study 
(see Section  4.1.1 ), and complete blood counts will be monitored regularly during the 
study (see Section A16–6). 
A16–5.1.2.5  Embryofetal Toxicity  
Embryofetal toxicity is a potential risk with tiragolumab.  Administration of 
tiragolumab is expected to have adverse effects on pregnancy based on the expression of 
TIGIT on decidual NK and CD8  
  T cells (Powell et al. 2017; van der Zwan et al. 2018; 
Vento -Tormo et al. 2018), and the expected role of these cells in the recognition and 
response to foreign fe tal, placental, and viral antigens at the maternal -fetal interface as 
well as maintenance of maternal -fetal tolerance.  No reproductive or teratogenicity 
studies in animals have been conducted with tiragolumab.  There are no clinical studies 
of tiragolumab  in pregnant women.  Tiragolumab should not be administered to 
pregnant women.  
Refer to Section 6 of the Tiragolumab Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description 
of embryofetal toxicity.  
A16–5.1.3  Risks Associated with Combination Use of RO7247669 and 
Tiragolu mab  
The blockade of inhibitory checkpoints leads to increase adaptive T -cell immune 
responses via complementary targets, and the combination targeting multiple 
checkpoints may be associated with heightened immune -mediated toxicity relative to 
Appendix 1 6:  Study Details Specifi c to RO7247669 600 mg   Tira A rm 
Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
356/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  either agent alone.  Such toxicity could manifest as a higher incidence or greater 
severity of autoimmune inflammation events, or potentially the development of HLH 
and MAS.  The following adverse events are potential overlapping toxicities associated 
with combination use of RO7247669 plus tiragolumab:  IRR and immune -mediated 
toxicities, (see Appendix  9 for complete list).  
A16–5.1.4  Management of  Patients Who Experience Specific Adverse 
Events in the RO7247669  600 mg   Tira  Arm  
A16–5.1.4.1  Dose Modifications  
There will be no dose modifications for RO7247669 or tiragolumab in this study.   
A16–5.1.4.2  Treatment Interruption for Toxicities  
Treatment with RO7247669 and tiragolumab may be temporarily suspended in patients 
experiencing toxicity considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are 
initiated for treatment of the toxicity, they must be tapered over   1 month 
to   10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent before study treatment can be resumed if 
warranted.  In  the neoadjuvant setting, the study treatment is limited to a pre -surgery 
window of 6  weeks.  Treatment during this period should not be interrupted, unless a 
patient experiences toxicity.  If toxicity meets criteria for interrupting/withholding 
RO7247669 and tiragolumab, RO7247669 and tiragolumab should be 
interrupted/withheld.  After  resolution of the toxicity, subsequent treatment cycles 
should only be considered if the benefit -risk profil e is acceptable and if the surgery can 
be conducted within 2 weeks of the planned date.  Otherwise, subsequent treatment 
cycles should be omitted to allow the patient to proceed directly to surgery without 
further delay.  
On the basis of the available chara cterization of mechanism -of-action, tiragolumab may 
cause adverse events similar to, but independent of, RO7247669 .  Tiragolumab may 
also exacerbate the frequency or severity of RO7247669 -related adverse events or may 
have non -overlapping toxicities with RO7247669 .  Because these scenarios may not be 
distinguishable from each other in the clinical setting, adverse events should generally 
be attributed to both agents, and dose interruptions or treatment discontinuation in 
response to adverse events should be  applied to both tiragolumab and RO7247669 .  
If RO7247669 is withheld  or discontinued, tiragolumab should also be withheld or 
discontinued.  If tiragolumab is withheld  or discontinued, RO7247669 should also be 
withheld  or discontinued.

A16–5.3.1  Pregnancies in Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Informed 
Consent Form to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during 
the study or within 4 months after the last dose of RO7247669 or within 90 days after 
the l ast dose of tiragolumab.  A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should 
be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and 
e-mail ing the form using the fax number or e -mail address provided to investigators.  
Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should 
discontinue study treatment and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the 
pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should 
continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with 
the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the 
pregnanc y, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  In  addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the 
pregnancy bec omes available.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When 
permitted by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health 
Information would need to be signed by one or both parents (as per local regu lations) to 
allow for follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's 
health status at birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form.  In addition, the Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant's 
health status at 6 and 12  months after birth.  
A16–5.3.2  Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients  
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the st udy or within 
4 months after the last dose of RO7247669 or within 90 days after the last dose of 
tiragolumab.  The investigator should report the pregnancy on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit the form to the Sponsor or its designee 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by 
faxing or by scanning and e -mailing the form using the fax number or e -mail address 
provided to investigators.  Attempts should be made to c ollect and report details of the 
course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study 
treatment.  When permitted by the site, the pregnant partner would need to sign an 
Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for 
follow -up on her pregnancy.  If the authorization has been signed, the investigator 
should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form with additional information

361/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  on the pregnant partner and the course and outcome of th e pregnancy as it becomes 
available.  
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When 
permitted by the site, an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health 
Information would need to be signed by one or both paren ts (as per local regulations) to 
allow for follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's 
health status at birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form.  In addition, the Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant's 
health status at 6 and 12  months after birth.  
An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may 
provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, 
to support  an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or 
obstetrician.  
A16–5.3.3  Abortions  
A spontaneous  abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as  the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse  Event eCRF, 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section  5.4.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal 
or embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other t han an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.  
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
A16–5.3.4  Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to 
study treatment or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study treatment 
should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section  5.2.2 ).

Melanoma Treatment Combinations —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
366/Protocol BO43328, Version 4  f After initiation of study treatment, all  adverse events will be reported until 30 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation 
of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first, and serious adverse events and adverse events of  special interest will continue to 
be reported until 135 days after the final dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first.  After this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  In addition, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator 
becomes aware of any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior exposure to study treatment (see Section 5.6).  For details on 
reporting all treatment -related non -serious adverse events that lead to surgical delay, see Section  5.6.  The investigator should follow each 
adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to 
follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study 
treatment or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
g Patients  who complete the treatment period,  regardless of whether they complete the study drug treatment period or discontinue study drug 
prematurely, patients who proceed to surgery will have their first long -term follow -up visit 3 months after surgery and patients who do not 
proceed to surgery  will have their first long -term  follow -up visit 3  months after the final dose of study treatment.  Information on survival 
follow -up and new anti -cancer therapy (including targeted therapy and immunotherapy) will be collected via telephone calls, patient med ical 
records, and/or clinic visits approximately every 3 months until death (unless the patient withdraws consent or the Sponsor t erminates the 
study).  If a patient requests to be withdrawn from follow -up, this request must be documented in the source doc uments and signed by the 
investigator.  If a patient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., county recor ds) to obtain 
information about survival status only.  For an experimental arm in which all patients disco ntinued treatment and passed the safety 
follow -up window, as well as approximately 80% of patients discontinued the study, the Sponsor may conclude the arm (the remaining 
~20%  of patients will be discontinued from the study).  
h Laboratory tests must be per formed within 72 hours prior to dosing during the  treatment period.   If screening laboratory assessments were 
performed within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1, they do not have to be repeated.  
i At the pre -surgery visit, adrenocorticotropic hormone , cortisol, S100, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate will be included in the chemistry 
panel.  
j This is only applicable if elevated levels of cardiac enzymes were detected in previous assessments.  
k If periods are missed or delayed before the 6 -month follo w-up visit, pregnancy testing should be repeated.  This test can be performed by a 
local gynecologist.  
l The Cycle 2 Day 1  on-treatment tissue sample must  be collected up to 72 hours  prior to drug administration.

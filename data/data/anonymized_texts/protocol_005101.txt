2 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Study Diseases 
Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) 
From the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Physician Guidelines (v2.2007): 
Mantle cell lymphoma has the worst characteristics of both indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's 
lymphomas.  Like many of the more common indolent lymphoid neoplasms, mantle cell lymphoma 
appears to be incurable with conventional chemotherapy. However, mantle cell lymphoma does 
not have an indolent natural history; rather, it has the shorter disease-free and overall survivals 
more characteristic of aggressive lymphomas. Therefore, there is no established standard of care. 
In the absence of standard management for mantle cell lymphoma, patients with this disease 
should be referred for participation in prospective clinical trials. Few patients present with localized 
MCL and the available published literature on management is retrospective and anecdotal. 
Outside of a clinical trial the panel recommended either combined modality therapy or involved 
field radiation therapy though this was based on treatment principles as there was not data to 
guide these recommendations. 
The overwhelming majority of patients with MCL will have advanced stage disease and require 
systemic therapy. For patients who do not have access to clinical trials for first line therapy, several 
regimens have shown significant activity including R-HyperCVAD (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone) alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine, R-CHOP, 
and REPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin) 
though relapse is common with a median time of 15-18 months without adjuvant stem cell 
transplant (autologous or allogeneic). 
Initial remission should be followed by stem cell transplantation (category 2B) in eligible patients as 
this has been associated with some evidence of durable remission. Allogeneic stem cell transplant 
alone or in the context of a clinical trial is considered as the first line consolidation therapy. The 
optimal approach to recurrent disease remains to be defined. For this reason, the entry of patients 
into clinical trials is strongly encouraged. Data has demonstrated a role for single agents such as 
cladribine and bortezomib. Combination such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, PCR 
(pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, rituximab), and FCMR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, 
mitoxantrone, rituximab) also have activity. Marked anti-tumor activity has been shown for 
rituximab plus thalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL. Patients who obtain only a 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  9 
04-10-2014 partial response to induction therapy are also appropriate candidates for clinical trials of high-dose 
therapy and additional therapeutic modalities. Radioimmunotherapy has shown to be active for 
both untreated and relapsed MCL. 
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)  
From the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Physician Guidelines (v2.2007): 
The realistic goal of induction therapy for DLBCL is to cure the disease. In fact, almost half of the 
patients with DLBCL may be cured with conventional therapy. Approaches to the treatment of 
DLBCL differ between patients with localized (Ann Arbor stage I-II) and advanced (Ann Arbor 
stage III-IV) disease. In patients with localized disease, treatment approaches also differ between 
patients with non-bulky (<10 cm) disease and those with bulky (≥ 10 cm) and/or extranodal 
disease. Patients with non-bulky localized disease who do not have adverse risk factors such as 
an elevated LDH, stage II disease, age >60 or an ECOG performance status 2 have an extremely 
good prognosis and may be treated with an abbreviated course (three cycles) of RCHOP 
(rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) combined with involved-
field RT. For patients with any of the adverse features listed above, the recommendation is 6- 8 
cycles of CHOP+R. Patients could receive additional adjuvant RT (category 2B). Patients who 
present with bulky disease and/or local extranodal disease may be more effectively treated with a 
full course (six to eight cycles) of CHOP chemotherapy with rituximab and involved-field RT 
(category 1). 
Treatment options for patients with advanced-stage disease vary depending on additional 
prognostic information provided by the Age-Adjusted International Index. Patients who fall into the 
low or low-intermediate risk category, as indicated by a normal LDH serum level and normal 
performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 0 or 1) are appropriate 
candidates for full course anthracycline-based chemotherapy. This therapy would include six to 
eight cycles of R-CHOP for patients of all ages (category 1). An alternative is CHOP-14 (bi-weekly 
CHOP) for patient >60. However, participation in clinical trials of new regimens is recommended if 
available. In patients with bulky disease or impaired renal function, initial therapy should include 
monitoring and prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome (i.e., vigorous hydration and administration of 
allopurinol). Patients who fall into the IPI high-intermediate- or high-risk category have less than a 
50% chance of being cured with standard therapy. For this reason, the consensus of the panel is 
that, if possible, these patients should be treated in the context of appropriate clinical trial s. Most 
current trials are evaluating augmented chemotherapy in the form of up-front or consolidative high-
dose therapy, with or without stem cell rescue, in this patient group. In patients who are not 
candidates for placement on a clinical trial protocol or who do not have access to a protocol, an 
alternative would be 6-8 cycles of CHOP (category 1) with rituximab. 
Patients who are receiving induction therapy should undergo repeat radiographic evaluation, 
including all positive studies, after three to four cycles of treatment. This early restaging is 
performed to identify, at the earliest point possible, patients whose disease has not responded or 
has progressed despite induction therapy. Upon completion of induction therapy, all positive 
radiographic studies should be repeated. Functional imaging (gallium or PET scans) may be 
particularly useful in determining whether residual masses represent fibrosis or viable tumor. A 
repeat biopsy of residual masses is recommended if the masses remained positive on a functional 
imaging scan upon completion of induction therapy. For patients having complete response (CR) 
or complete response/unconfirmed (CRu), the planned course of treatment is completed. 
Consideration of autologous stem cell transplant or completing the course of therapy with a higher 
RT dose (40-45 Gy) is recommended for stage I-II patients with partial response (PR). Stage III-IV 
PR patients need to continue with R-CHOP to a total of 6-8 cycles. In addition, appropriate clinical 
trial is recommended for all the PR patients. If there is no response to treatment or progressive 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  10

isease is observed, patients are treated as relapsed. Patients who experience relapse following 
an initial complete response or have refractory disease and who are candidates for hi gh-dose 
chemotherapy should be treated with a non-cross-resistant combination chemotherapeutic 
regimen, such as ICE±R (ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide), DHAP (dexamethasone, 
cytarabine [cytosine arabinoside], and cisplatin), MINE (mitoxantrone, ifosfamide, mesna, 
etoposide), miniBEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan), and ESHAP 
(methylprednisolone, etoposide, cytarabine, cisplatin) in an attempt to achieve a second response. 
Patients who respond (CR or PR) to a non-cross-resistant chemotherapy regimen should be 
considered for further consolidation with high-dose therapy and stem cell support (category 1 for 
second response in relapse, category 2A for all others). There are multiple approaches to high-
dose therapy with stem cell support; however, none of these has emerged as the preferred 
alternative. Additional RT can be given before or after stem cell transplant to sites of bulky disease. 
Pertinent clinical trials are considered another option in this case. Patients who achieve complete 
remission and are not eligible for high-dose therapy should be treated individually. Similarly, 
patients with disease recurrence following high-dose therapy should be treated in the context of a 
clinical trial or individually. However, patients with disease progression despite three successive 
chemotherapeutic regimens are not likely to benefit from currently available standard therapy, 
except for patients with a long disease-free interval. 
2.2 Study agents 
2.2.1 Bortezomib 
Bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341), the prototypical clinically relevant proteasome inhibitor, is a 
dipeptidyl boronic acid derivative that has recently been approved for use in myeloma and 
mantle cell lymphoma and has also shown activity in other hematologic malignancies ( 1-3). 
Bortezomib inhibits the chymotryptic activity of the 20S proteasome, and in so doing, 
disrupts the proteasome-mediated degradation of diverse cellular proteins ( 4). Bortezomib 
activity has been postulated to reflect interference with NF- B signaling secondary to 
inhibition of degradation of the NF- κB-inhibitory protein IκBα ( 5). However, multiple other 
mechanisms of lethality have been proposed, including increased generation of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), which has been demonstrated in lung cancer and leukemia cells ( 6). 
Moreover, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to kill cells in association with induction 
of ER stress, presumably by interfering with the disposition of unfolded proteins. For 
reasons that are incompletely understood, proteasome inhibitors selectively induce 
apoptosis in tumor as compared with normal cells ( 7, 8). 
2.2.2 Vorinostat 
Vorinostat, a Class I/II histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI), was the first approved agent of 
this class on the basis of activity in refractory cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( 9, 10). In phase I 
and phase II trials vorinostat also has elicited responses in acute leukemia, lymphoma, and 
a variety of solid tumors ( 11, 12 ). 
HDIs are a chemically diverse group of compounds that share the ability to inhibit histone 
deactylases (HDs) and thereby promote acetylation of histones that in turn results in 
chromatin uncoiling and transcription of otherwise silenced genes ( 12). HDIs also promote 
acetylation of diverse non-histone proteins, and this may cause protein dysfunction ( 13). 
Downstream effects are diverse, and, in many or most cases, it is unclear whether these 
effects are due to promotion of gene expression or non-histone protein acetylation or the 
combination. 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  11 
04-10-2014 H
DIs can induce apoptosis in leukemic cells through processes regulated by induction of 
the cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1 (14), generation of reactive oxygen species 
and Bid activation ( 15). Further, HDIs can inactivate cytoprotective signaling pathways (e.g., 
Raf/MEK/ERK and Akt) ( 16). Certain HDIs, including vorinostat, promote acetylation of 
HSP90, tubulin and dynein ( 17, 18 ). Acetylation and inactivation of Hsp90 induces 
increases in misfolded proteins that form protein aggregates. These protein aggregates are 
transported by dynein along a microtubule network to the aggresome where they are further 
processed for ultimate proteasomal degradation. HD6 is responsible for maintenance of 
deacetylation and proper functioning of dynein and other components of the aggresome. 
Disruption of HD6 results in dynein acetylation, aggresome dysfunction, and cell death 
manifest ed by the formation of dysmorphic perinuclear aggresomes. HDIs also can induce 
differentiation of tumor cells ( 9). 
2.2.3 Bortezomib and Vorinostat in Combination 
In preclinical studies involving both Bcr/Abl+ and Bcr/Abl- leukemia cells, including Bcr/Abl+ 
cells resistant to imatinib, we have shown synergistic cytotoxic interactions between 
bortezomib and vorinostat and other HDIs ( 19, 20). More recently, we have observed 
comparable synergistic interactions between bortezomib and vorinostat in continuously 
cultured human multiple myeloma cells as well as fresh CD138+ bone marrow cells 
(presumptive myeloma cells) from patients with multiple myeloma ( 21). 
Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain synergism between these agents: 
(1) HDI-mediated inhibition of class I, nuclear HDs may result in sustained activation of NF-
B, and lethal effects of HDIs may be intrinsically limited by this activation ( 22). Concurrent 
proteasome inhibition may disrupt NF- B activation and thereby potentiate HDI antitumor 
activity ( 23, 24 ). 
(2) Cell death resulting from HDI-mediated HSP90 and aggresome dysfunction may be 
potentiated by concurrent inhibition of the proteasome ( 25, 26 ). 
(3) HDI-mediated accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum may 
provoke an evolutionarily conserved adaptive response referred to as the unfolded protein 
response (UPR) ( 27, 28). It consists of multiple components that can be broadly 
characterized as alarm, adaptive, and apoptotic responses, including cell cycle arrest, 
chaperone protein synthesis, up-regulation of cytoprotective signaling pathways (including 
NF-κB), inhibition of protein translation, and enhanced protein degradation. When the UPR 
is overwhelmed, it triggers events that lead to apoptosis. Because proteasome inhibitors 
both promote accumulation of unfolded proteins and down-regulate NF-κB, it is plausible to 
propose that concurrent proteasome inhibition may potentiate the lethality of the UPR. 
Recent studies in pancreatic cancer cells implicate this mechanism in the enhanced lethality 
of proteasome/HDI regimens ( 29). 
Recent preclinical studies from our laboratories in human U937 cells (derived from a patient 
with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), T-lymphoblastic Jurkat cells, and primary AML blasts 
demonstrate a high degree of synergism between non-toxic concentrations of bortezomib 
and vorinostat. Similar results have been obtained in other lymphoma lines (e.g., SU-DHL 
16, Karpas, and Raji). In each case, low, relatively non-toxic concentrations of bortezomib 
(e.g., 3-5 nM) and vorinostat (e.g., 1 μM), administered concurrently for 24 hrs resulted in a 
significant increase in apoptosis. The enhancement of lethality for the combination is at 
least as great as that previously reported in Bcr/Abl+ leukemia and in multiple myeloma 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  12 
04-10-2014 c
ells, raising the possibility that this strategy may be effective in lymphoproliferative 
malignancies such as lymphoma. 
In an ongoing phase I trial of the combination of bortezomib iv days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and 
vorinostat po on days 4 through 11 on a 21 day cycle in patients with previously treated 
myeloma, maximum tolerated doses of bortezomib and vorinostat appear to be 1.3 
mg/m2/dose and 400 mg/dose, respectively ( 30). These doses are being confirmed in an 
expansion of the maximum tolerated dose patient cohort. Dose limiting toxicities were 
fatigue and QT interval prolongation. Other toxicities have included infections and 
thrombocytopenia. Toxicities appear to be cumulative, and schedule adherence in later 
cycles will be a focus in the ongoing study. Preliminary analysis suggests that the 
combination is active including activity in patients with bortezomib-refractory disease. 
2.3 Study Design Considerations 
Vorinostat typically displays cumulative toxicities and often is administered by an interrupted 
schedule. As the basis of this study is evidence of synergistic interactions between bortezomib and 
vorinostat, it seems appropriate to administer the two agents concurrently as much as feasible. 
Based upon the ongoing phase I trial it appears that 10 days of vorinostat is the most that is 
tolerated within a conventional bortezomib schedule (days 1, 4, 8, and 11 repeated every 21 days). 
In this study patients will receive two 5 day courses of vorinostat concurrent with twice weekly 
dosing of bortezomib. 
After discussions with CTEP, it has been decided to target two entities within the spectrum of 
lymphoma: mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma is an 
attractive target as bortezomib has single agent activity against this entity and as there is a 
pressing need for better therapies for this usually lethal condition. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is 
another attractive target as with current therapy most patients are not cured of this most common 
of the aggressive lymphomas. 
As the primary endpoint is disease response, patients must have measurable disease. 
Presumably response rates that would be considered promising would differ depending upon 
whether patients had received prior bortezomib. Although it might be preferable to test the 
combination exclusively in patients who have not received prior bortezomib, the recent approval of 
bortezomib for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma makes it unclear whether it would be 
feasible to enroll sufficient numbers of such patients with mantle cell lymphoma in a reasonable 
time frame. Therefore, we propose enrollment of 3 patient cohorts: mantle cell lymphoma, without 
prior bortezomib; mantle cell lymphoma, with prior bortezomib; and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(without prior bortezomib). Should it become apparent during the course of the study that one or 
the other mantle cell lymphoma cohort is not likely to be completed, then that cohort will be closed 
to further enrollment. 
Prior high dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant raises similar issues with regard to 
promising response rates as well as tolerance for the combination regimen. Rather than establish 
separate cohorts for this parameter (potentially requiring 6 patient cohorts, each with different 
response rate targets), however, we propose to stratify patients according to this parameter in 
order to establish the appropriateness of an analysis of study outcomes on the basis of this factor. 
Patients with persistent/recurrent lymphoma following prior allogeneic transplantation usually have 
resistant tumors and impaired host tolerance of further treatments. Inclusion of such patients might 
bias the study against an otherwise active regimen. 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  13 
04-10-2014 As the effects of bortezomib and vorinostat on the developing human fetus at the recommended 
therapeutic dose are potentially devastating, women of chi ld-bearing potential and men must agree 
to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to 
study entry and for the duration of study participation and to report pregnancy or suspected 
pregnancy while participating in the study. For similar reasons, women who are pregnant or 
nursing may not participate. 
As there is no phase I experience with the combination in children, they are excluded. 
2.4 Correlative Studies Background 
Two of the three proposed mechanisms for synergistic interaction among the two agents involve 
interactions with NF-kappaB. Nuclear RelA by immunohistochemical staining is a semi-quantitative 
measure of NF-kappaB activation with which the investigators have prior experience ( 31). It is 
reasonable to propose that the combination of bortezomib and vorinostat might be more active in 
lymphomas in which there is baseline activation of NF-kappaB, and this is a testable hypothesis. 
Lymphoma cell nuclear relA will be assayed in tumor samples obtained previously to confirm 
eligibility.

.1.12 The effects of bortezomib and vorinostat on the developing human fetus at the recommended 
therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must 
agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) 
prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and to report pregnancy or 
suspected pregnancy while participating in the study. 
3.1.13 A bility to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria 
3.2.1 Chemotherapy or large field radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study. 
3.2.2 Prior histone deactylase inhibitor as cancer treatment. 
3.2.3 Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents. 
3.2.4 Plans for other concurrent cancer treatment. If steroids for cancer control have been used,

3.2.10 Medical or other condition (for example : uncontrolled infection; potentially life threatening 
changes on EKG ) or concurrent treatment (for example, marrow suppressive agents such as 
zidovidine) that represents an inappropriate risk to the patient or likely would compromise 
achievement of the primary study objective. Note that bortezomib is a 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 
3A4 substrate. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in 
combination with the CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers listed in Section 5.2.2 . 
3.2.11 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bortezomib and vorinostat are potential 
teratogens. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants 
secondary to treatment of the mother with bortezomib and vorinostat, breastfeeding should be 
discontinued. 
3.2.12 Active concurrent malignancy, except adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer. 
3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities

 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
4.1 General Guidelines 
Patients are registered on study centrally at the Moffitt Cancer Center. 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within one week. Notify the SEP2C 
Administrator of longer delays or a decision not to initiate study treatment and document. 
Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-supplied 
agents directly from CTEP. Agents may be ordered by a participating site only after the initial IRB 
approval for the site has been forwarded by the Coordinating Center to the CTEP PIO 
(PIO@ctep.nci.nih.gov ). 
4.2 Registration Process 
To register a patient, the following should be faxed (813- 745-5944) or e-mailed 
(SEP2C@moffitt.org ) to the SEP2 C Administrator: 
 Copy of signed and dated eligibility form (attached in Oncore) 
The SEP2C administrator will then complete the registration process by: 
 Registering the patient to Cohort A: mantle cell lymphoma, no prior bortezomib (Cohorts B and 
C are clos ed) 
 Assigning a registration number 
 Assigning stratification 
 Stratum SG01: prior autologous transplant 
 Stratum SG02: no prior autologous transplant 
 Transmitting the patient number to the participating site. 
The research nurse or data manager must then ente r subject registration information into Moffitt’s 
Oncore prior to starting study treatment. 
5 TREATMENT PLAN 
5.1 Schedule and Dosing 
Patients whose serum total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN within 4 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 should not 
receive study treatment and must be taken off-study. 
Vorinostat 400 mg (total daily dose as a single dose) days 1-5 and 8- 12. 
Borte
zomib 1.3 mg/m2/d iv days 1, 4, 8, and 11. 
Vorinostat precedes bortezomib on days of concurrent administration. 
Repeat every 3 weeks. 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  21 
04-10-2014 M
inor modifications in schedule may be made to accommodate scheduling difficulties. Modification 
and cause should be documented. In any event, bortezomib doses should not be administered 
closer than 72 hours apart. 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
5.2.1 Agent Related Supportive Care 
Advise patients that vorinostat may cause anorexia, dehydration, diarrhea, nausea and 
emesis. 
Encourage and monitor for adequate fluid and food intake. 
Prescribe anti-emetics as clinically indicated. 
Instruct patients to begin loperamide (or similar anti-diarrheal agent) at the first signs of: 1) 
poorly formed or loose stool, 2) more bowel movements than usual in one day, or 3) 
unusually high volume of stool. Loperamide dose and schedule is 4 mg (generally, 2 tablets) 
at first onset of diarrhea, then 2 mg (1 tablet) after each unformed stool, but not to exceed 
16 mg/day (8 tablets/day). Loperamide should not be taken prophylactically. Avoid 
loperamide if there is the presence of blood or mucus in the stool or if diarrhea is 
accompanied by fever. If grade 3 or 4 diarrhea develops, discontinue vorinostat. 
Consider intravenous hydration with each infusion of bortezomib. Intravenous infusion of 
1000 mLs of normal saline or D5W over 30-60 minutes is recommended, or, in patients with 
cardiac concerns or fluid overload issues, intravenous infusion of 500 mLs normal saline or 
D5W via over 60 minutes. 
Prophylactic antiviral treatment is recommended for all patients receiving bortezomib . 
Acyclovir 400 mg po bid or a similar regimen is recommended. Prophylactic antiviral 
treatment is allowed for all patients at the discretion of the treating physician. 
In general, because of the risk of confounding response assessments, corticosteroids are to 
be avoided concurrent with study participation with the following exceptions: 
 Corticosteroids for nausea control are allowed. 
 Topical, intra-articular, and eye drop steroids are allowed. 
Steroids for other indications should be discussed with the study chair prior to use. 
Provide other supportive care measures as clinically indicated.

04-10-2014 5
.2.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers 
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase the exposure of the patient to 
bortezomib, while co-administration of a CYP3A4 inducer may reduce the efficacy of 
bortezomib. Therefore, patients should be closely monitored when given bortezomib in 
combination with the CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers listed in the table below. 
Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors  CYP3A4 Inducers  
indinavir  carbamazepine  
neflinavir  phenobarbital  
ritonavir  phenytoin  
clarithromycin  pioglitazone  
itraconazole  rifabutin  
ketoconazole  rifampin  
nefazodone  St. John’s wort  
 troglitazone

“Clinically Relevant Table”, Updated November 14, 2011  
5.2.3 Concurrent Cancer Treatment 
Concurrent non-study cancer treatment is not permitted. Non-prescription nutritional and 
dietary supplements are discouraged but not prohibited and, if used, should be 
documented. 
5.3 Duration of Therapy 
Continue treatment until: 
 Disease progression or requirement of palliative irradiation 
 Unacceptable toxicity 
 Patient decision to discontinue treatment 
 Investigator decision that treatment no longer is in the patient’s best medical interest 
 Study closure 
Patients who experience a complete or partial response following at least one year of treatment 
may go off study treatment but remain on study and resume study treatment upon disease 
progression if the study remains open. 
5.4 Duration of Follow Up 
Continue disease status follow up until disease progression or initiation of another treatment. 
Continue toxicity follow-up until resolution or stabilization of treatment related toxicity or initiation of 
another treatment that confounds ongoing toxicity evaluation. 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  23 
04-10-2014 5
.5 Criteria for Removal from Study 
Patients are off study when off treatment and disease status and toxicity follow up is complete. 
Certain subsequent events, however (for example, secondary malignancies) may remain subject to 
reporting if identified. See Section 7 . 
6 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
Scheduled agent doses are administered or omitted, not delayed, with the exception that initial 
doses of a new cycle are delayed pending resolution of dose-modifying toxicity. If dose-modifying 
toxicity requires treatment delay for longer than 3 weeks, consider whether patient should be taken 
off study treatment as per Section 5.3 . If dose omission for toxicity, omit one or both agents 
according to clinical judgment with regard to attribution and severity. 
Vorinostat and bortezomib have both overlapping and non-overlapping toxicities; for example, 
fatigue or sensory neuropathy might be due to either/both agents, but motor neuropathy most likely 
would be due to bortezomib. Investigators adjust the administration of either/both agents according 
to the nature, severity, and attribution of toxicity in the suggested sequences. 
Dose Level Modifications for Toxiciti es  
See following tables for independent dose adjustments of drugs.  
 
Hematologic   
Non-hematologic  
(excluding bortezomib -induced neuropathy  and 
excluding hyperbili rubinemia ) 
*See instructions below  
 
Grade  Action  Grade  Action  
Grade ≥ 3 Omit; resume dosin g at 
next lower  dose level 
upon resolution to 
Grade ≤ 2. Grade 2, 
optional.  
 
Grade  ≥ 3, 
required.  Omit; resume dosing at next lower  
dose level upon resolution to  
Grade ≤ 2 (Grade 1 preferred).  
 
Vorinostat Dose/Schedule Reduction Schema 
1 Reduce vorinosta t to 300 mg/dose  
2 Reduce vorinostat to 200 mg/dose  
3 Reduce vorinostat to 100 mg/dose  
4 Discontinue vorinostat  
 
Bortezomib Dose/Schedule Reducti on Schema, excluding neuropathy1 
1 Reduce bortezomib dose to 1.0 mg/m2 
2 Reduce bortezomib dose to 0.7 mg /m2 
3 Reduce bortezomib dosing to once weekly  (in weeks 1 & 2 of cycle)  
4 Reduce bortezomib dosing to once per cycle  
5 Discontinue bortezomib2 
 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  24 
04-10-2014 Bortezomib-Induced Hyperbilirubinemia Dose Reduction Schema 
Patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 1.5  ULN) do not require a starting dose 
adjustment. Please note that patients with bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN are excluded from 
enrollment in this protocol. If a patient develops moderate or severe hepatic impairment with 
bilirubin ≥ Grade 2 (> 1.5 X ULN) while on study, the investigator should hold bortezomib until 
the toxicity returns to < Grade 2. Restarting bortezomib at the next lower dose level could be 
considered at the Investigator’s discretion following exclusion of bortezomib-induced liver 
impairment and careful consideration of liver disease due to other causes, such as, but not 
limited to, active infection. Bortezomib doses may be re-escalated subsequently at the 
discretion of the investigator, but not to levels higher than the patient’s initial dose. 
Bortezomib -Induced N europathy  Dose/Schedule Reduction Schema1 
Grade 1 (paresthesias and/or loss of 
reflexes) without pain or loss of function  No action  
Grade 1 with pain or  
Grade 2 (interfering with function but not 
with activities of daily li ving)  Reduce bortezomib dose by one dose level, 
according to table above  
Grade 2 with pain or  
Grade 3 (interfering w ith activities of daily 
living)  Withhold bortezomib therapy until toxicity 
resolves  to Grade 1 or less, then resume at 0.7 
mg/m2 and change  treatment schedule to once 
per week  (in weeks 1 & 2 of cycle);  except if 
already at 0.7 mg/ m2 once per week, then 
discontinue bortezomib.2 
Grade 4 (disabling)  Discontinue bortezomib2 
1 If both bortezomib dose/schedule reduction schemas apply, administer lower/less frequent bortezomib 
dose/schedule. 
2 If bortezomib must be discontinued due to dose reductions and vorinostat is tolerable, patient may 
continue on vorinostat alone at treating physician’s discretion until next scheduled response assessment. 
At that time, if patient continues without evidence of progression or intolerable vorinostat toxicity , patient 
may continue on vorinostat alone. 
7 ADVERSE EVENT LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
7.1 Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks List (CAEPR) 
Adverse events will be categorized in terms of nature, severity, and attribution and documented 
according to the NCI CTCAE v4 .0 beginning April 1, 2011 ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
7.2 CAEPR - Bortezomib 
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) f or Bortezomib (PS-341, 
NSC 681239) 
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by body system. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific 
Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is 
identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI via CTEP-AERS (except as noted 
below). Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements'

Note: Vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza) in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of 
any adverse event currently known to be caused by the other agent, or the combination may result 
in events never previously associated with either agent.  
7.4 Adverse Event Characterization  
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be 
utilized for AE reporting beginning April 1, 2011. All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 ‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ (see Sections 7.2 and 7.3 above) for 
expedited reporting purposes only. ‘Expected’ AEs (the ASAEL) are bold and italicized  in the 
CAEPR ( Sections 7.2 and 7.3). 
 Attribution  of the AE: 
 Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
 Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment. 
 Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment. 
 Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment. 
 Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment. 
7.5 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
7.5.1 Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP-AERS (CTEP Adverse Event Reporting 
System), accessed via the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). The reporting procedures 
to be followed are presented in the “CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting 
Requirements” which can be downloaded from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
These requirements are briefly outlined in the table below ( Section 7.5 .3). 
In the rare event when Internet connectivity is disrupted, a 24-hour notification is to be made 
to NCI by telephone at: 301- 897-7497. An electronic report MUST be submitted immediately 
upon re-establishment of internet connection.  
7.5.2 CTEP-AERS is programmed for automatic electronic distribution of reports to the following 
individuals: SEP2C Administrator ( SEP2C@moffitt.org ), Study Chair, and the local treating 
physician. CTEP-AERS provides a copy feature for other e-mail recipients.

1 Adverse events with attribution of possible, probable, or definite that occur greater  than 30 day s 
after the last dose of treatment with an agent under a CTEP IND require reporting as follows:  
CTEP -AERS 24 -hour notification followed by complete report within 5 calendar days for:  
 Grade 4 and Grade 5 unexpected events  
CTEP -AERS 10 calendar day report:  
 Grade 3 unexpected events with hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
 Grade 5 expected events  
2 Although a CTEP -AERS 24 -hour notification is not required for death clearly related to progressive 
disease, a full report is required as outlined in  the table.  
December 15, 2004  
Note: All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting regardless of 
causality. Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided. 
 Expedited AE reporting timelines defined: 
 “24 hours; 5 calendar days” – The investigator must initially report the AE via CTEP- AERS 
within 24 hours of learning of the event followed by a complete CTEP-AERS report within 5 
calendar days of the initial 24-hour report. 
 “10 calendar days” - A complete CTEP-AERS report on the AE must be submitted within 10 
calendar days of the investigator learning of the event. 
 Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipitates hospitalization 
(or prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be reported regardless of attribution and 
designation as expected or unexpected with the exception of any events identified as 
protocol-specific expedited adverse event reporting exclusions.  
 Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, 
or birth defects must be reported via CTEP-AERS if the event occurs following treatment with an 
agent under a CTEP IND. 
 Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol-specific patient ID assigned during trial 
registration on all reports. 
7.6 Routine Adverse Event Reporting 
All Adverse Events must be reported in routine study data submissions. AEs reported through 
CTEP-AERS must also be reported in routine study data submissions.

.7 Secondary Malignancy 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to describe the event:  
 Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML])  
 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
 Treatment-related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported 
via routine reporting.  
7.8 Second Malignancy 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting via 
CDUS unless otherwise specified.

8.2 Vorinostat (NSC 701852) 
Chemical Name: N-hydroxy- N’-phenyl-octane-1,8-diotic acid diamide; N-hydroxyl- N’-phenyl (9CI) 
octanediamide; suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid 
Other Names: SAHA, L- 001079038, WIN 64652, MSK390, AP390, Zolinza® 
Classification: Antineoplastic 
CAS Registry Number: 149647- 78-9 
Molecular Formula: C 14H20N203 
M.W.: 264.32 
Approximate Solubility: Water ≤ 5 mg/mL 
Description: Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor 
Mode of Action: Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of enzymes that regulate chromatin 
remodeling and gene transcription via the dynamic process of acetylation and deacetylation of core 
histones. Vorinostat, a potent inhibitor of HDAC activity, binds directly to the catalytic pocket of HDAC 
enzymes. It causes G1 or G2 phase cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or differentiation in cultured 
transformed cells. 
How Supplied: Supplied by Merck and Co., Inc. and distributed by the CTEP, DCTD, NCI as a 
white, opaque gelatin, size 3 capsule, containing 100 mg of vorinostat. The inactive ingredients 
contained in each capsule are microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, and magnesium 
stearate. Vorinostat 100 mg capsules are supplied in bottles containing 120 capsules. 
Storage: Store at room temperature, 15 to 30 ºC (59 to 86 ºF). Do not store above 30ºC. Avoid 
exposure to excessive moisture. 
Stability: Shelf life stability studies of the intact bottles are on-going. 
Route of Administration: Orally 
Method of Administration: Unless otherwise stated in the protocol, vorinostat capsules must be 
administered whole. Administer doses of vorinostat with food, if possible. 
Potential Drug Interactions: The major pathways of vorinostat metabolism involve glucuronidation 
and β-oxidation. As vorinostat is not eliminated via CYP450 pathways, no drug-drug interactions 
are expected with known CYP450 inhibitors or inducers. Prothrombin time and INR prolongations 
have been reported in patients taking vorinostat concomitantly with coumarin derivative 
anticoagulants. Monitor these patients more frequently for alterations in their coagulation 
parameters. 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  35 
04-10-2014 Special Handling: Vorinostat is an anticancer drug. Clean powder spills from broken or damaged 
vorinostat capsules carefully minimizing inhalation. Wash spill area at least 3 times with ethyl 
alcohol, followed by water. 
Vorinostat is provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement between Merck Pharmaceutics, 
Inc. and the DCTD, NCI (see Section 12.5 ). 
8.3 Agent Ordering 
NCI-supplied agents may be requested by the Principal Investigator (or their authorized designees) 
at each participating institution. Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy requires that 
the agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treate d. PMB does not 
permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is obtained). 
The CTEP-assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP-supplied investigational 
agents. The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be registered with CTEP, 
DCTD through an annual submission of FDA form 1572 (Statement of Investigator), Curriculum 
Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF). If there 
are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP-supplied investigational agents for 
the study should be ordered under the name of one lead investigator at that institution. 
Active CTEP-registered investigators and investigator-designated shipping designees and ordering 
designees can submit agent requests through the PMB Online Agent Order Processing (OAOP) 
application ( https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx ). Access to OAOP requires the 
establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account ( https://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/ ) and the maintenance of an “active” account status and a “current” password. 
For questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or accountability, call (240) 276-6575 Monday 
through Friday between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm (ET) or email PMBAfterHours@mail.nih.gov . 
8.4 Agent Accountability 
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must maintain a careful 
record of the inventory and disposition of all agents received from DCTD using the NCI Drug 
Accountability Record Form (DARF). (See the CTEP home page at http://ctep.cancer.gov  for the 
Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage and to obtain a copy of the DARF and Clinical 
Drug Request form.)  
9 CORRELATIVE STUDIES 
Baseline nuclear relA expression as a predictive marker of response to the combination of 
bortezomib and vorinostat in the treatment of mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
The rationale is described in Section 2.4 . 
Directions for obtaining and submitting tissue samples for correlative studies are found in Section 
12.1. 
Before subjecting the samples to immunohistochemical evaluation,the available histological material 
will undergo central pathological review  at the 
Moffitt Cancer Center. 
The expression of Rel A protein will be evaluated by immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody 
for testing on paraffin slides. We will use a mouse monoclonal anti- NF-κB antibody, p65 subunit  
(Chemicon International, Temecula CA , clone 12H11).  This antibody is selective to the activated 

 
NCI-8064 Version 18  36 
04-10-2014 form of NF- κB. This monoclonal antibody recognizes an epitope overlapping the nuclear localization 
signal (NLS) of the RelA/p65 transac tivation subunit . 
Briefly, pretreatment for antigen retrieval is performed using the DAKO Antigen Retrieval kit 
(Cat#S1700). Samples are preheated to 98 C for 15 min. After cooling for 20 min @ room 
temperature in solution, the samples are washed in milliQ-water for 4-5 min. The samples are 
incubated in quenching buffer for 10 min, washed in milliQ-water for 4-5 min, and incubated for 10 
min with Avidin blocking buffer (Vector Labs Cat#SP-2001). After washing with PBS for 5 min, the 
slides are blocked with Biotin blocking buffer, and placed in blocking buffer (1% BSA, 0.2% Milk) for 
an hour. This is followed by incubation with the anti- NF-kB primary antibody (2 ug /mL) in blocking 
buffer overnight at 4 C. After rinsing with PBS for 5 min, the slides are incubated with a biotinylated 
goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, diluted in blocking buffer (0.334 ug/mL) for 1 hr at room 
temperature. After washing with PBS for 5 min, the slides are incubated with streptavidin– HPR 
diluted in blocking buffer 1:100 for 30 min (Invitrogen TSA Kit #21 cat# T20931), and washed again. 
The slides are next incubated in biotin –XX tyramide (in kit amplification buffer/0.0015% H 2O2) for 10 
min. After an additional washing, the sample is incubated with ABC for 30 min (Vector labs Cat# PK-
6100) and developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) for 1-7 min (Vector labs Cat# SK-4100). All 
of the slides are lightly counterstained with hematoxylin for 10s before dehydration and mounting. 
Immunostaining is observed with a Leitz Orthoplan 2 microscope and images are captured by a 
CCD camera with the Smart Capture Program (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL ). Positive controls will be 
run with each set of slides according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Negative controls will be 
included by omitting the primary antibody during the primary antibody incubation. 
The stained slides will be read by , MD in a blinded fashion, and scored for the 
presence of Rel A protein. The positive antibody reaction will consist in a nuclear dark-brown stain. 
The stain will be scored into four grades, according to the intensity of the staining: 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+. 
The percentages of positive cells will also be scored into four categories: 0 (0%), 1 (1-33%), 2 (34-
66%), and 3 (67-100%). The product of the intensity and the percentage scores will be used as the 
final score. 
To define the B cell immunophenotype (germinal center B cell-like or activated B cell-like) we will 
subject the samples to immunostains with CD10 and CD23. To identify germinal center B cells we 
will use a mouse monoclonal anti CD10 Ab (abCam Inc., Cambridge, MA; clone 56C6, dilution1: 25), 
and for the detection of activated B cell-like we will use a mouse monoclonal Ab to CD23 (abCam 
Inc., Cambridge, MA; clone 1B12; dilution1:10). In addition the samples will be stained for CD20 
using a mouse monoclonal Ab (abCam Inc., Cambridge, MA; clone L26; dilution 1:300). All of the 
immunostains will be performed as described above.

11 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT 
Response will be assessed according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma 
(35). These criteria with reference to mantle cell and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are summarized 
and modified for this study according to the following two tables; otherwise, see the publication. 
These criteria stipulate that each measureable lesion be evaluated by the bi-dimensional 
measurements and that the sum of the product of the diameters be reported in case report forms.

Centralized Radiology Review 
Radiologic images to determine response status (baseline and subsequent exams) will be 
transmitted to the Study Chair’s site for centralized review and confirmation of response assessment 
when a subject  goes off treatment.  
Images should be copied onto CDs in Dicom format. 
All CDs should be anonymized, i.e., patient-specific information will be removed - site information 
and date/type of image can remain , at the treating site prior to submission. 
Site personnel should use a soft-tipped permanent marker to note the following information on each 
CD submitted: 
 Study: NCI 8064/MCC 15428 
 Subject Initials  
 Subject’s Sequence Number  
Each CD may contain multiple exams for a single study subject, but must not contain exams for 
multiple subjects. 
Each CD submitted must be accompanied by a completed Radiology Exam Transmission 
Notification form (Appendix A). 
Submit CDs and completed Radiology Exam Transmission Notification forms to: 
 
VCU Massey Cancer Center 
 
  
 
 
Send CDs and forms via traceable mechanism (Federal Express, DHL, other).

04-10-2014 12 SUBMISSION OF MATERIALS FOR CORRELATIVE STUDIES, CENTRAL 
PATHOLOGICAL REVIEW, DATA REPORTING, AND REGULATORY 
REQUIREMENTS 
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 7  (Adverse 
Events: List and Reporting Requirements). 
12.1 Submission of Materials for Correlative Studies and Pathological Review 
Submission of slides or blocks is acceptable. If slides are submitted, send at least 10 unstained 
tissue sections on positively-charged glass slides. Slides will NOT be returned to the send; tissue 
blocks will be returned if requested. 
Choice of material for submission: 
 If the patient’s disease process has been known to undergo histological transformation in the 
past, the submitted tissue should be obtained relatively recently and must be obtained 
subsequent to the most recent systemic treatment. In some cases this may necessitate a 
repeat biopsy. 
 If the patient’s disease has NOT been known to undergo histological transformation in the past, 
any archival tissue suffices. If there are multiple archival samples, the most recent (not the 
initial diagnostic) sample should be submitted. The rationale for this is that the purpose of the 
biopsy is to correlate NF-κB expression with response.  If NF-κB is variable within the lifespan 
of a tumor, the most recent tissue sample is more likely to reflect the on -study status of NF-κB 
expression.  
At least 24 hours PRIOR to tissue sample submission, email the following individuals to alert them 
to sample submission: 
    
  
Samples should be shipped Monday through Thursday and not the day before a holiday. 
Samples must be shipped by a traceable mechanism, e.g., Federal Express, UPS, DHL. Phone 
contact for shipping:  
The Tissue Notification Form (Appendix B) must accompany all sample submissions. 
Material must be submitted to  of the Moffitt Cancer Center Department of 
Pathology for correlative studies and central pathological review at the address below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Be sure to mark on the package: “ATTENTION: , STUDY SPECIMEN.”

2.2 Data Reporting 
12.2.1 Method 
This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) version 3.0. 
Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports 
are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31. Instructions for submitting data using 
CDS application can be found on the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Note : All 
adverse events that have occurred on the study, including those reported through CTEP 
AERS, must be reported via CDS. 
12.2.2 Responsibility for Data Submission 
Study sites are responsible for entering data at least monthly in the Coordinating Center’s 
Oncore™ database to allow time for Coordinating Center compilation and Study Chair 
review prior to monthly safety teleconferences.  
The Southeast Phase Two Consortium (SEP2C) leadership committee has identified that 
the Study Chair is the appropriate individual to be responsible for compiling and submitting 
CDUS data to CTEP for all participants on his study, as he is actively monitoring the 
protocol and evaluating the data. The Study Chair and related staff will work closely with the 
coordinating center (Moffitt Cancer Center) to ensure that logistical barriers related to CTEP 
reporting are removed.  
12.3 Data and Safety Monitoring 
12.3.1 Safety Updates  
The SEP2C Coordinating Center is responsible for distributing all IND Action Letters or 
Safety Reports received from CTEP to all participating institutions for submission to their 
individual IRBs for action as required.  
12.3.2 Monitoring 
The Study Chair and the Massey research team will monitor the data and submit reports to 
the SEP2C Steering Committee at least monthly. 
12.3.3 Auditing 
The trial will be audited in a manner consistent with the SEP2C guidelines. 
12.4 CTEP Multicenter Guidelines 
This protocol will adhere to the policies and requirements of the CTEP Multicenter Guidelines. The 
specific responsibilities of the Protocol Chair and the Coordinating Center (Study Coordinator) and 
the procedures for auditing are found in CTEP’s Investigator Handbook 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/handbook/index.html ). 
 The Coordinating Center is responsible for distributing all IND Action Letters or Safety Reports 
received from CTEP to all participating institutions for submission to their individual IRBs for

NCI-8064 Version 18  42 
04-10-2014  
Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-supplied 
agents directly from CTEP. Agents may be ordered by a participating site only after the initial 
IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by the Coordinating Center to the CTEP PIO 
(PIO@ctep.nci.nih.gov ) (except for Group studies).  
12.5 Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA)/Clinical Trials Agreement (CTA) 
The agents supplied by CTEP, DCTD, NCI in this protocol are provided to the NCI under a 
Collaborative Agreement (CRADA, CTA, CSA) between the NCI Division of Cancer Treatment and 
Diagnosis and Merck and Company and Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc (herein referred to as 
Collaborator(s)). The agents that will be supplied in this protocol are vorinostat and bortezomib, 
respectively. Therefore, the following obligations/guidelines, in addition to the provisions in the 
Intellectual Property Option to Collaborator ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/industry ) contained within the 
terms of award, apply to the use of the Agent(s) in this study: 
1. Agent(s) may not be used for any purpose outside the scope of this protocol, nor can Agent(s) 
be transferred or licensed to any party not participating in the clinical study. Collaborator(s) data for 
Agent(s) are confidential and proprietary to Collaborator(s) and shall be maintained as such by the 
investigators. The protocol documents for studies utilizing investigational Agents contain 
confidential information and should not be shared or distributed without the permission of the NCI. 
If a copy of this protocol is requested by a patient or patient’s family member participating on the 
study, the individual should sign a confidentiality agreement. A suitable model agreement can be 
downloaded from: http://ctep.cancer.gov . 
2. For a clinical protocol where there is an investigational Agent used in combination with (an)other 
investigational Agent(s), each the subject of different collaborative agreements , the access to and 
use of data by each Collaborator shall be as follows (data pertaining to such combination use shall 
hereinafter be referred to as “Multi-Party Data.” ): 
a. NCI will provide all Collaborators with prior written notice regarding the existence and 
nature of any agreements governing their collaboration with NIH, the design of the proposed 
combination protocol, and the existence of any obligations that would tend to restrict NCI's 
participation in the proposed combination protocol. 
b. Each Collaborator shall agree to permit use of the Multi-Party Data from the clinical trial 
by any other Collaborator solely to the extent necessary to allow said other Collaborator to 
develop, obtain regulatory approval or commercialize its own investigational Agent. 
c. Any Collaborator having the right to use the Multi-Party Data from these trials must agree 
in writing prior to the commencement of the trials that it will use the Multi-Party Data solely 
for development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of its own investigational 
Agent. 
Clinical Trial Data and Results and Raw Data developed under a Collaborative Agreement will be 
made available exclusively to Collaborator(s), the NCI, and the FDA, as appropriate and unless 
additional disclosure is required by law or court order. Additionally, all Clinical Data and Results 
and Raw Data will be collected, used, and disclosed consistent with all applicable federal statutes 
and regulations for the protection of human subjects including, if applicable, the  Standards for 
Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information  set forth in 45 C.F.R. Part 164. 
4. When a Collaborator wishes to initiate a data request, the request should first be sent to the 
NCI, who will then notify the appropriate investigators (Group Chair for Cooperative Group studies, 
or PI for other studies) of Collaborator's wish to contact them. 
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  43 
04-10-2014 5. Any data provided to Collaborator(s) for phase 3 studies must be in accordance with the 
guidelines and policies of the responsible Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), if there is a DMC for 
this clinical trial. 
6. Any manuscripts reporting the results of this clinical trial must be provided to CTEP by the Group 
office for Cooperative Group studies or by the principal investigator for non-Cooperative Group 
studies for immediate delivery to Collaborator(s) for advisory review and comment prior to 
submission for publication. Collaborator(s) will have 30 days from the date of receipt for review. 
Collaborator shall have the right to request that publication be delayed for up to an additional 30 
days in order to ensure that Collaborator’s confidential and proprietary data, in addition to 
Collaborator(s)’s intellectual property rights, are protected. Copies of abstracts must be provided to 
CTEP for forwarding to Collaborator(s) for courtesy review as soon as possible and preferably at 
least three (3) days prior to submission, but in any case, prior to presentation at the meeting or

manuscript or other form of public disclosure shall contain any of Collaborator’s confidential/ 
proprietary information. 
13  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 Mantle Cell Lymphoma  
No prior bortezomib (Cohort A): 
Patients will be accrued to the protocol according to a two-stage minimax design ( 36). Based on 
patient response (CR + PR), we will either conclude that the therapy is effective or ineffective. The 
two-stage design has the smallest sample size with the following two properties: 
(1) if the true response rate is less than or equal to 30%, we will conclude that the therapy is 
ineffective with probabilit y of at least 90% (alpha = .10), and 
(2) if the true response rate is at least 50%, we will conclude that the therapy is effective with 
probability at least 90% (beta = .10). 
At least 8 of 28 patients must respond in the first stage to proceed to the second stage. At any 
point when it is realized that this cannot happen, the study will be stopped and the therapy will be 
considered ineffective. Under the null hypothesis, this would occur with 36% probability. If the 
protocol proceeds to the second stage, at least 16 of 39 patients overall must respond for the 
therapy to be considered effective. 

 
NCI-8064 Version 18  44 
04-10-2014 P
rior bortezomib (Cohort B – closed with Protocol Version 8.0, 3/17/10): 
Patients will be accrued to the protocol according to a two-stage minimax design (2). Based on 
patient response (CR + PR), we will either conclude that the therapy is effective or ineffective. The 
two-stage design has the smallest sample size with the following two properties: 
(1) if the true response rate is less than or equal to 10%, we will conclude that the therapy is 
ineffective with probability of at least 90% (alpha = .10), and 
(2) if the true response rate is at least 25%, we will conclude that the therapy is effective with 
probability at least 90% (beta = .10). 
At least 3 of 27 patients must respond in the first stage to proceed to the second stage. At any 
point when it is realized that this cannot happen, the study will be stopped and the therapy will be 
considered ineffective. Under the null hypothesis, this would occur with 48% probabilit y. If the 
protocol proceeds to the second stage, at least 7 of 40 patients overall must respond for the 
therapy to be considered effective. 
13.2 Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma  
(Cohort C – closed 6/25/2013) 
Patients will be accrued to the protocol according to a two-stage minimax design. Based on patient 
response (CR + PR), we will either conclude that the therapy is effective or ineffective. The two-
stage design has the smallest sample size with the following two properties: 
(1) if the true response rate is less than or equal to 10%, we will conclude that the therapy is 
ineffective with probability of at least 90% (alpha = .10), and 
(2) if the true response rate is at least 25%, we will conclude that the therapy is effective with 
probability at least 90% (beta = .10). 
At least 3 of 27 patients must respond in the first stage to proceed to the second stage. At any 
point when it is realized that this cannot happen, the study will be stopped and the therapy will be 
considered ineffective. Under the null hypothesis, this would occur with 48% probability. If the 
protocol proceeds to the second stage, at least 7 of 40 patients overall must respond for the 
therapy to be considered effective. 
13.3 Stratification Factors 
For each tumor type, patients will be stratified according to prior or no prior autologous stem cell 
transplant. This stratification will not affect the assessment of the primary aim, treatment response. 
However, it will be used as a variable in the correlative studies logistic regression analysis 
described below, as well as to gauge whether it significantly affect the progression-free survival in 
any of the three treatment arms in Cox regression analysis. 
13.4 Correlative Studies 
The two correlative studies will be conducted by pooling the data across the three treatment arms 
(with the use of dummy variables for two of the treatment arms as offsets); to adjust for multiple 
testing, the Bonferroni-Holm procedure will be used to have an overall alpha of .05. The sample 
size for this protocol was determined for the primary endpoint. It is unclear whether this will be 
sufficient for these secondary aims, especially the second one which requires pre- and post-
 
NCI-8064 Version 18  45 
04-10-2014 t
reatment biopsies, which may not be performed in all patients. Also, one or more of the treatment 
arms may be terminated early. However, this testing plan provides the possibility of a statistically 
significant result if the hypothesized association is quite strong and could have data from as many 
as 116 patients, if all three treatment arms completely accrue. Prior to analysis with the dependent 
variable, response (and while blinded to its possible association), a power transformation of the 
independent variable (nuclear relA expression) will be considered, with the powers 1 (raw data), ½ 
(square root), and 0 (log transformation) examined. The Anderson-Darling test for normality will be 
the principal measure of ideal transformation, with the lowest value being the best. Slight 
preference will be given to both the raw and log transformations over the square root based upo n 
their more facile interpretation (when examining change, a difference in raw values represents an 
additive change, while a difference in log values represents a multiplicative change). After the 
transformation has been determined and agreed upon by the PI and statistician, the main tests will 
be conducted. These will be logistic regression analyses, with three independent variables: nuclear 
relA expression, and dummy variables for the two mantle cell lymphoma groups (with the diffuse 
large cell lymphoma arm arbitrarily selected as the referent group).

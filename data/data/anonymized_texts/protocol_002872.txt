 1.  SYNOPSIS  
Name of Investigational Product  
Crenolanib besylate ( AR-868,596 -26) 
Title of Study  
Phase II  Study of Crenolanib Besylate Maintenance following Allogeneic Stem Cell 
Transplantation in Patients with FLT3 -positive Acute Myelogenous Leukemia  
Number of Planned Patients   
48 patients  
Length of Study   
 2 years  
Primary Objective  
• To assess progression -free survival (PFS) time, defined as the time to disease 
progression or death, whichever occurs first, starting when crenolanib administration is 
begun.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
• To assess disease -free surviv al (DFS) time, overall survival (OS) tim e, graft -versus -host 
disease, and 100 -day transplant -related mortality.  
Study Rationale  
 
The treatment of FLT3 -mutant AML is complicated by the poor outcome with standard 
induction and consolidation therapy.  To date the use of allogeneic transplant in first 
remission is of limited effectiveness to improving outcomes due to persistent relapse risks.  
Crenolanib i s a FLT3 targeted TKI that has preliminary clinical activity as a salvage therapy 
in a heavily pretreated AML population with FLT3 ITD, FLT3 D83 5, and compound FLT3 
ITD/D835 mutations including those with resistance after prior TKI therapy.  Given the 
favorable safety profile of crenolanib and promising clinical benefit in AML patients, a trial 
examining the role of crenolanib as maintenance in th e post -transplant setting is warranted.  
 
Crenolanib besylate is an orally bioavailable benzimidazole  that was designed to be a 
selective and potent inhibitor of  the class III receptor kinase FLT3. Molecular binding data 
support that crenolanib is a type I  kinase inhibitor that binds preferentially to the active 
kinase conformation of FLT3. As a result of this property, crenolanib potently inhibits both 
wild type and constitutively active mutant FLT3 kinase. Specifically, in 51 patients with 
relapsed/refrac tory FLT3 ITD and/or TKD mutant AML including relapse following 
multiple lines of therapy including  prior  TKIs, crenolanib was well tolerated and 
demonstrated an overall clinical benefit of 55% including complete remission ( CR), 
incomplete hematological re covery ( CRi), and partial remission ( PR).  Six of 51 patients of 
this heavily pretreated group were bridged to transplant.   
 
Study Design   
This is a study of crenolanib as maintenance in the post -HSCT setting in AML patients with 
FLT3 mutations.

 Forty -eight patients who have undergone first allogeneic transplant eligible to receive oral 
crenolanib besylate will be enrolled.  There will be two cohorts in the study. Cohort A will 
include patients who underwent allogeneic SCT while in first or second comp lete 
remission with count recovery. Cohort B will include patients who underwent HSCT with 
incomplete count recovery although they had ≤%10 bone marrow blasts at the time of 
HSCT.  
 
Start of maintenance crenolanib therapy is intended at the earliest time no  sooner than 42 
days but no later than 90 days after allogeneic HSCT.  
 
Maintenance therapy with crenolanib will be given at a dose of 100 mg BID.  Patients 
considered at high risk of relapse, i.e. patients in second remission after prior relapsed or 
refrac tory disease, patients with measurable residual disease, or patients who received a 
haploidentical HSCT may receive 100 mg TID.    
 
Crenolanib should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to or following a meal. Patients will 
complete a daily diary for 728 da ys to record the date, time, and amount (number of tablets) 
of crenolanib taken and relation to eating schedule (Appendix III).  
 
Patients may take crenolanib continuously for up to 728 days or until one of the criteria for 
study discontinuation is fulfilled.  Cycles of therapy will be repeated every 28 days, and 
therapy will be continued until clinically significant disease progression or documentation 
of unacceptable toxicity as determined by the investigator or 728 days of therapy are 
reached.  If the drug is discontinued for toxicity, patient should be reassessed until toxicity 
has resolved.   
 
Patients who have discontinued study drug for reasons other than toxicity will be followed  
for 30 days post last dose or until the commencement of new thera py, whichever occurs 
earlier.

Preliminaries  
This is a single -arm, Phase II study of crenolanib in allogeneic stem cell transplant in 
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CR after allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation . Administration of crenolanib is oral, and will be started at some time 
between 42 and 90 days post -transplant, and then given every day for up to two years .  There 
are two patient subgroups: 1) those that were in complete remission (CR) at the time of 
transplant, and 2) those that were not in complete remission (NCR) at the time of tran splant.  
The primary outcome is progression -free survival (PFS) time, defined as the time to disease 
progression or death, whichever occurs first, starting when crenolanib administration is 
begun.  A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled in each subgroup . 
 
Futility Monitoring  
PFS time will be monitored separately within each of the two subgroups, using the Bayesian 
method of Thall et al. [1].  Denote standard therapy by S and the experimental crenolanib 
therapy by E.  Assume that TS = PFS time with S foll ows an exponential distribution with 
median mS and that TE = PFS time with E in the each subgroup follows an exponential 
distribution with median mE.  Denote the median PFS times for the standard and 
experimental therapies by mS and mE, respectively.  Unde r a Bayesian model, both mS and 
mE are assumed to follow Inverse Gamma(a, b) priors.  
 
Secondary outcomes and data analyses.  
Secondary outcomes will include disease -free survival (DFS) time, overall survival (OS) 
time, graft -versus -host disease, and 100 -day transplant -related mortality.  Within each 
subgroup, CR and no CR, these events will be tabulated and the distributions of DFS and 
OS time estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier [2].

 2.  BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
2.1  Introduction  
 
Allogeneic  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is offered to eli gible patients with 
suitable donor to increase long term survival in patients with FLT3 positive acute myelogenous 
leukemia (AML). However, disease relapse due to presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) 
remains a key reason of treatment failure in post-transplant  patients [1]. Furthermore, a recent 
study showed that the presence of internal tandem duplication of FLT3 gene (FLT3 -ITD) 
correlated with a higher risk of relapse and lower leukemia free survival  (LFS) after allogenei c 
HSCT performed in first CR (Figure 1.1).

Presence and absence of FLT3 -ITD is denoted by dashed line and solid line, respectively.  
(A) Estimated probability of 2 years of cumulative incidence of relapse; (B) leukemia -free 
survival after transplantation at 2 years.  
 
The m ajority of relapses occur within 8 months after transplant [3] and m ost patients who relapse 
after allogeneic HSCT do not achieve long -term survival with available salvage treatment  
modalities including second HSCT. Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has b een 
used to prevent relapse of AML in  the post-transplant setting; however, it is often associated with 
life-threatening G VHD [4]. Therefore, it is critical to develop a novel agent which  can be given 
when minimal MRD is present, is tolerable , has activity  against the disease , and can be given 
early after transplant.  
2.2  Crenolanib inhibits wild -type FLT3 and constitutively active mutations  
 
Crenolanib, a FMS like tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is well tolerated in relapsed/refractory 
FLT3 mutant positive AML patients after allogeneic HSCT and may present a novel pathway to 
prevent relapse .

 Crenolanib besylate (also known as CP -868,596 -26) is an orally bioavailable class III RTK 
inhibitor that potently targets FLT3. Crenolanib inhibits wild -type FLT3 and its constitutively 
active mutations at clinically achievable concentrations. [5, 6]   
 
Crenolanib has heightened binding affinity against the FLT3 -ITD mutation (the most frequent 
FLT3 aberration in AML) and TKD point mutations FLT3 (D835H), FLT3 (D835Y) and FLT3 
(D835V). Cre nolanib binds to FLT3 -ITD and F T3-TKD D835H with Kd values of 0.43 and 0.4 
nM, respectively. Similarly, crenolanib also binds to FLT 3-TKD D835Y with a Kd of 0.18 nM. A 
saturation mutagenesis screen of FLT3 ITD showed that crenolanib is a “pan -FLT3 inhibitor” that 
has the ability to successfully suppress all resistance -conferring TKD mutants [5]. Crenolanib 
inhibitory activity has been verified  in human AML cell lines. [5]

Crenolanib is a type 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is active against FLT3 regardless of 
conformation status.

Crenolanib has reduced activity against KIT  
Crenolanib has been found to be approximately 100 -fold more selective for FLT3 than for KIT 
and is therefore highly selective toward FLT3 relative to KIT [8] and elicits cytotoxicity in FLT3 –
mutant AML while largely sparing KIT inhibition (100 -fold offset in both viability and

 biochemical assays) with limited activity against o ther kinases. As a result, crenolanib may be 
associated with less myelosuppression than the other  FLT3 TKIs.   
2.3 Clinical Studies of Crenolanib in AML  
 
2.3.1 Clinical Summary of Crenolanib in Relapsed/Refractory FLT3 mutated AML  
Crenolanib has been studied in relapsed/refractory FLT3 mutant AML ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). As of July 30, 2014, a total of 51 AML patients have been treated with single -
agent crenolanib. Patients had received a median number of 3 prior therapies for AM L (range 1 -
7) including prior transplant and TKI therapy.  
 
Of the 51 AML patients (FLT3 ITD, or FLT3 D835, or FLT3 ITD/D835) treated with crenolanib, 
49 patients were eligible for efficacy evaluation. Crenolanib has demonstrated clinical activity in 
this heavily treated population. Several patients showed peripheral blast clearance after crenolanib 
therapy (Figure 5.5). Twenty -seven ( 27) patients have demonstrated response, including 1 
complete remission (CR) with full count recovery, 8 CR with incomplete hematological recovery 
(CRi), 7 partial remissions (PR) and 11 blast responses. Clinical benefit rate was 55 %. Five  (11 
%) of these heavily pre -treated patients were bridged to transplant. Of the 25 patients with FLT3 -
D835 AMl, 14 patients have gained cli nical benefit (56 %): 6 CR/ CRi (24%), 4 PR (16 %), and 4 
blast response (16 %)  [9, 10] .

Toxicity data from 38 patients is available. Overall, crenolanib was well -tolerated. Commonly 
observed side effects included nausea (76 %), vomiting (52 %), diarrhea (47%), and transaminase

 elevations (8 -11 %). Two patients went off study due to toxicities, one due to nausea / vomiting 
and one due to fatigue. Dose reduction occurred in 2 patients , one due to nausea and a nother due 
to transaminitis, respectively.  
 
As of yet, QT prolongation has not been reported in  the 51 patients with AML treated with 
crenolanib. Most patients had received concomitant medication including antifungal medicine 
throughout crenolanib therapy ; nonetheless no QT prolongation has been observed.  
 
In conclusion, crenolanib is a FLT3 TKI that has showing preliminary clinical activity in a heavily 
pretreated  AML  population with FLT3 -ITD, FLT3 -D835, and compound FLT3 -ITD/D835 mutant 
disease . Importantly, crenolanib is the first agent to demonstrate clinical activity in patients with 
FLT3 -D835 activating mutations.  
 
2.3.2 Tolerability of Crenolanib in AML Patients Who Have Undergone Prior Allogeneic 
Bone Marrow Transplant  
 
Within the 51 AML pat ients treated with single agent crenolanib , a total of thirteen patients (6M, 
7F) had undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplants .   Seven patients received crenolanib  at 
a dose of 100  mg TID (total daily dose of 300  mg). Six patients received a highe r total daily dose 
of 200mg/m2/day given in three divided doses.  
 
The median age of the se patients was of 55 years (37 -76). The median duration between 
allogeneic HSCT and initiation of crenolanib therapy was 249 days (34 -1313).  Nine patients had 
progress ed after prior FLT3 TKI exposure (7  patients had had prior treatment with sorafenib , 4 
with midostaurin , 3 with quizartinib, and one  with PLX3397).    
 
Overall,  a similar rate  and spectrum  of toxicities were observed when crenolanib was 
administered at either dose level to the se 13 previously transplanted patients as compared to the  
non-transplanted patients  with relapsed AML.  The most common adverse events were 
gastrointestinal (nausea (31%), vomiting (31%), diarrhea (23%), and constipation (23%)), a nd 
infections (pneumonia (23%), mucositis oral (21%), and fever (15%)).  
 
Three  of the six patients  who received the  higher total dose of 200mg/m2/day of crenolanib  
require d dose reduction due to toxicities :  one patient for periorbital edema, o ne patient for 
neutropenia, and another patient for elevated bilirubin. Th is latter patient was found to have 
reactivation of GVHD  on liver biopsy  as major causative factor causing elevated bilirubin . The 
patient with neutropenia recovered his neutrophil counts after stopping valganciclovir. The 
patient with periorbital edema was able to resume crenolanib without recurrence of the edema.  
All seven patients treated with the 100  mg TID dose of crenolanib  tolerated  drug well without 
needing a dose reduction.  None of these  7 patient s was discontinued for toxicities.  Therefore, it 
appears crenolanib at 1 00 mg TID should be reasonably tolerated in this patient population.

 Crenolanib has been given to patients with relapsed FLT3( +) AML for up  to five months without 
any cumulative toxicities.   In a Phase I pediatric glioma study conducted at the St. Jude 
Children's Research Hospital, 6 children received crenolanib for at least 12 months  and t wo 
children stayed on study  drug for 24 months.  Long -term exposure to crenolanib seems to be 
tolerable and safe.     
2.4  Rationale for Baseline Dose Selection  
 
Day 1 pharmacokinetics data is shown in Figure 5.7  for 7 post -HSCT patients receiving a 100 
mg TID dose of crenolanib.   The c renolanib  pharmacokinetics did not appear to be altered  in 
patients who had had prior HSCT (as compared to the other AML patients).  However, due to the 
vulnerability of this patient population, out of abundant caution, crenolanib will be administered 
at a dose of 100 mg BID . Patients considered at high risk of relapse, i.e. patients in second 
remission after prior relapsed or refractory disease, patients with measurable residual disease, or 
patients who received a haploidentical HSCT may receive 100 mg TID.    
 
Figure 2.4  Crenolanib pharmacokinetics in AML patients with a prior history of  HSCT  
(dose 100mg TID)  
 
  
 
Patients with post -allo BMT receiv e immunosuppressive agents including tacrolimus . These 
agents are typically tapered off by Day 100 post -transplant. A number of other anti -microbial 
agents are also gradually taper ed off post 100 days of allogeneic transplant. As this protocol 
allows patients to start as early as Day 42, patients earlier in the transplant course will be started 
at 60mg BID . Dose will be escalated no sooner than at 1 month intervals to 80 mg BID , then to 
80 mg TID. That dose will then be maintained for a maximum of 2 years maintenance.  
 
Rationale for this trial  
The treatment of FLT3 -mutant AML is complicated by the poor outcomes with standard induction 
and consolidation therapy.  T o date t he use of allogeneic stem cell transplant ation  in first remission 
is of limited effectiveness to improving outcomes due to persist ent relapse risks.  Crenolanib is a 
FLT3 targeted TKI that has  preliminary clinical activity as a salvage therapy in a heavily 110100100010000

 pretreated AML population with FLT3 ITD, FLT3 D835, and compound FLT3 ITD/D835 
muta tions including those with resistance after p rior TKI therapy.  Given the favorable safety 
profile of crenolanib and promising clinical benefit in AML patients, a trial examining the role of 
crenolanib as maintenance in the post -transplant setting is warranted.  
 
 
3.  STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objecti ve 
• To assess  progression -free survival (PFS) time, defined as the time to disease progression or 
death, whichever occurs first, starting when crenolanib administration is begun.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
• To assess disease -free surviv al (DFS) time, overall survival (OS) time, graft -versus -host 
disease, and 100 -day transplant -related mortality.  
 
4.  STUDY DESIGN  
This is a phase II study of crenolanib as maintenance in the post -HSCT setting in AML patients 
with FLT3 mutations.  
 
Forty -eight p atients who have undergone first allogeneic transplant eligible  to receive oral 
crenolanib besylate will be enrolled .  There will be two cohorts in the study. Cohort A will include 
patients who underwent a llogeneic SCT while in first or second compl ete remission with count 
recovery. Cohort B will include patients who underwent HSCT with incomplete count recovery 
although they had ≤% 10 bone marrow blasts at the time of HSCT.  
Start of maintenance crenolanib therapy is intended at the earliest time no s ooner than 42 days but 
no later than 90 days after allogeneic HSCT.  
 
Maintenance therapy with crenolanib will be given at a dose of 100 mg BID. Patients considered 
at high risk of relapse, i.e. patients in second remission after prior relapsed or refracto ry disease, 
patients with measurable residual disease, or patients who received a haploidentical HSCT may 
receive 100 mg TID.   
 
Crenolanib should be taken at least 30 minutes prior to or following a meal. Patients will complete 
a daily diary to record the  date, time, and amount (number of tablets) of crenolanib taken and 
relation to eating schedule (Appendix III).  
 
Patients may  take crenolanib  continuously for up to 728 days or until one of the criteria for study 
discontinuation is fulfilled.  Cycles of the rapy will be repeated every 28 days, and therapy will be 
continued until clinically significant disease progression or documentation of unacceptable 
toxicity as determined by the investigator or 728 days of therapy is reached.  If the drug is 
discontinued for toxicity, patient should be reassessed until toxicity has resolved.   
 
Patients who have discontinued study drug  for reasons other than toxicity  will be followed  for 30 
days post last dose or until the commencement of new therapy, whichever occurs earl ier.

STUDY THERAPY  
6.3 Crenolanib Maintenance Therapy  
  
Generally, p atients will be treated according to the following:   
• Maintenance therapy with crenolanib is intended in all patients in CR/CRi after allogeneic 
HSCT.  
• Start of maintenance crenolanib therapy is intended at the earliest time no sooner than 42 days 
but no later than 90 days after allogeneic HSCT.  
• Prerequisites  for start of maintenance are hematological recovery with  neutrophils >1.0 x 
109/L, all non -hematological toxicities have to be below CTC AE grade 2, GVHD ≤ Grade 1, 
either no signs of chronic GVHD or mild chronic GVHD graded as limited disease.  
• Maintenance therapy will be given for up to 728 days. (up to 26 cycles where 1 cycle of therapy 
is defined as 28 consecutive days regardless of whether study drug is taken or not) after 
recovery from allogeneic HSCT as long as the  patient does  not develop disease progression 
while on crenolanib therapy . 
• Patients should take their doses at approximately the same time each day, and approximately 
8 hours should elapse between doses. Each dose should be given at least 30 minutes prior to 
Protocol ARO -009 version 2.0

 or 30 minutes after foo d with a glass of water (no juice) (~240 ml).  Patients should be 
instructed to swallow the tablets whole and not to chew them.  
• Maintenance therapy with crenolanib will be given at a dose of 100 mg BID. Patients 
considered at high risk of relapse, i.e. pa tients in second remission after prior relapsed or 
refractory disease, patients with measurable residual disease, or patients who received a 
haploidentical HSCT may receive 100 mg TID.   
• Dose reduction guidelines for adverse events are listed in Table 7.1 and 7.2 in Section 7.1.  
Dose reductions beyond those mentioned in these tables or different than those specified, 
should be discussed with the Sponsor and documentation of the justification recorded.  
• Antiemetics per ASCO guidelines for moderately emetogen ic therapy should be instituted. 
Reduction in antiemetic support can be individualized as appropriate.  
• If a dose is missed or vomited, it should not be taken again.  The next dose should not be 
increased to account for missing a dose.  The patient should n ote the missed dose  in the patient 
diary  and take the next regular dose at the regularly scheduled time.  
• Subsequent cycles may be delayed for recovery of toxicity .  Delays in start of subsequent 
cycles greater than 8 weeks will be acceptable only after de termination of the principal 
investigator of potential risk/benefit ratio.  
• For patients who discontinue therapy, the reason for treatment discontinuation will be captured.  
6.4 Duration of Therapy  
Treatment may continue for 728 days until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
1. progressive disease defined as:  
1.1 Death due to any cause  
1.2 Start of any non -protocol therapy directed toward AML  
1.3 Relapse defined as detection of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood OR > 5% blasts in 
marrow not attributed to another cause.   
2. Intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the investigator prevents further administration of 
treatment, or  
3. Patient request, or  
4. General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patien t unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator, or  
5. Unacceptable toxicity that in the opinion of the investigator makes it unsafe to continue 
therapy, or  
 
It is planned that up to a total of 728 days of therapy will be administered  for patients deriving 
benefit from this regimen.  
 
A minimum of 1 full course (defined as the administration of crenolanib for 28 days) will be 
required for a patient to be considered as having received an adequate trial to evaluate efficacy. 
Only those p atients who failed to  complete  at least  one cycle  (28 consecutive days)  of crenolanib 
therapy , unless they progressed or dropped out due to toxicity  will be replaced. All patients 
receiving at least one dose of study drug will be considered evaluable for t oxicity.

• Patients with counts of neutrophils >1x109/L and platelets >100 x109/L should not have any 
dose modification.  
• Patients with pre -cycle counts of neutrophils >1x109/L and platelets >100 x109/L and no 
evidence of  residual leukemia who have sustained neutropenia <0.5 x109/L or platelet counts 
<25 x x109/L for more than 4 consecutive weeks in the current cycle, may receive a subsequent 
cycle at 1 dose level reduction.  A reduction of 2 dose levels may be considered if the 
myelosuppression was deemed severe and life threatening by the treating physician, and if it 
is in the patient's best interest.

Dose Modifications of Crenolanib due to Toxicities  
One dose reduction to 80 mg BID is allowed in a single subject for toxicity management 
regardless of the attribution. Reductions below 80 mg BID are not planned. Dose reductions 
beyond 80 mg BID or different form the dose specified below should be discussed with an d 
approved by the sponsor or its designees. Any dose modification, including dose hold and dose 
delay, must be documented and justified in the eCRF. Dose re -escalation is in general not 
allowed on this study. Any exception must be approved by the sponsor i n writing.  
 
Table 7.3 Crenolanib dose reduction schedule  
Dose level   Crenolanib dosing  
0 100 mg BID  
-1 80 mg BID  
 
Patients considered at high risk of relapse, i.e. patients in second remission after prior relapsed or 
refractory disease , patients with measurable residual disease,  or patients who received a 
haploidentical HSCT  may receive 100 mg TID.  
 
If more than 20% (more than 1 patient of the first 5 patients enrolled; more than 2 patients of the 
first 10 patients enrolled; or more than 3 patients of the first 15 patients enrolled)  of the subjects 
require crenolanib dose reduction during the first 2 cycles of therapy, then the study will be paused 
for protocol re -evaluation. These data will be presented to the Sponsor’s safety monitoring team  
to deter mine  whether the crenolanib dose should be modified for all future patients.  
7.4 Cycle  Delays  
• A cycle of therapy may be delayed to allow recovery from toxicities.  
• Delays in start of subsequent cycles greater than 8 weeks will be acceptable only after 
determination of the principal investigator of the potential risk/benefit ratio.

11.  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
11.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a 
pharmaceutical product but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with  study  
treatment.  
 
Adverse drug reaction is a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs 
at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for the 
modification of physiologic function.  
 
Assessing c ausal connections between agents and disease is fundamental to the understanding of 
adverse drug reactions. In general, a drug may be considered a contributory cause of an adverse 
event if, had the drug not been administered, 1) the event would not have ha ppened at all, 2) the 
event would have occurred later than it actually did, or 3) the event would have been less severe.  
 
Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03 and 
documented in the case report form (CRF). After the Informed Consent Form  is signed, study 
site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s pre -existing conditions, 
including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease. During the study, site 
personnel will record any change in the pre -existin g condition(s) and the occurrence and nature 
of any new adverse events. All adverse events  of grade 3, grade 4, or grade 5 , regardless of the 
relationship to the study drug, either expected or unexpected,  must be recorded, graded, and 
reported to the Spons or.  
 
Expected events post-transplant  are:    
 
1) Febrile or infection episodes not requiring management in the intensive care unit  
2) Preexisting side effects related to prior disease specific therapy  including GVHD related 
symptoms  (Sinusoidal Obstruction Syn drome (SOS), rash etc.)  or ongoing medications 
for management of non -leukemia conditions  (Diarrhea, mucositis etc.)  
3) Myelosuppresion and myelosuppression -related events  
4) Bone, joint, or muscle pain  
5) Fatigue/malaise  
6) Weakness  
7) Alopecia  
General Therapy Related Events : 
 
1). Catheter related events (thrombosis, bleeding, infection)  
2). Rash related to antibiotic use or GVHD  
3). Hospitalization for the management of any of the above expected events

Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc.                      Confidential  22 
 Reporting Hematology and Blood Chemistry Results:  
 
• Data captured in addition to the protocol specified scheduled visit is to be reported on 
CRFs ; this includes grade 3 and grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, independent of impact 
on do sing or associated signs and sym ptoms  
• Transfusion information is to be captured throughout the study . 
 
Adverse Event Reporting in 30 -day Follow -up Period:  
• Adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs consent until 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug  or until start of new study drug .  
• If the patient  with active AE  goes on to another clinical study or standard therapy  within 
the 30 day post -discontinuation follow up , active adverse events  should continue to be 
captured  until resolution  for minimum  of 30 days, if possible .  Data should  includ e name 
of new therapy.  
• Patients who do not have progressive disease but stop crenolanib for toxicity should be 
followed until resolution of toxicity.  
• Patients who have progressive disease and do not receive further therapy do not need to 
be followed, unless there is toxicity rela ted to study drug which is unresolved at the time 
patient is taken off study  
11.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the patient, in 
the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it 
occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it oc curred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity – a substantial disruption of a person’s ability 
to conduct normal life functions . 
• A pregnancy or  congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that do not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency roo m or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 
312.32).  
 
Any important medical event may be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by the Principa l 
Investigator and the IND Sponsor.

_____________________________________________________________________________   
Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc.                      Confidential  23 
 All serious adverse events occurring during the conduct of a protocol will be reported (either via 
expedited report or log) to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures.    
 
All serious adverse events will be recorded in the case report form.  
 
Hospitalizations for the management of any expected adverse events (previously described) 
will not have an expedited report but it will be included in the annual report via the SAE log.  
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected, and regardless of attribution to the 
study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of 
knowledge of the event to AROG.   
• The institution’s Internal SAE Rep ort Form for Prompt Reporting will be used for reporting to 
AROG.  
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs consent until 30 days 
after the last dose of drug. Serious adverse events must be followed until clinical recovery is  
complete and laboratory tests have returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, 
or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
• Additionally, any serious adverse event s that occur after the 30 day  post-discontinuation  time 
period t hat is related to the study treatment must be reported to IRB and to AROG. This may 
include the development of a secondary malignancy.  
11.3 Reporting of a Serious Adverse Event to FDA  
Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND Sponsor (AROG ) according to 21 
CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research teams to ensure serious adverse events are reported 
according to the Code of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, 
the sponsor’s guidelines,  and Institutional Review Board policy.  
 
12.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Preliminaries  
This is a single -arm, Phase II study of crenolanib in allogeneic stem cell transplant in patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CR after  allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Administration 
of crenolanib is oral, and will be started at some time between 42 and 90 days post -transplant, and 
then given every day for up to two years .  There are two patient subgroups: 1) those that were in 
comp lete remission (CR) at the time of transplant, and 2) those that were not in complete remission 
(NCR) at the time of transplant.  The primary outcome is progression -free survival (PFS) time, 
defined as the time to disease progression or death, whichever oc curs first, starting when 
crenolanib administration is begun.  A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled in each subgroup.  
12.2 Futility Monitoring  
PFS time will be monitored separately within each of the two subgroups, using the Bayesian 
method of Thall  et al. [1].  Denote standard therapy by S and the experimental crenolanib therapy 
by E.  Assume that TS = PFS time with S follows an exponential distribution with median mS and

_____________________________________________________________________________   
Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc.                      Confidential  24 
 that TE = PFS time with E in the each subgroup follows an exponential distribu tion with median 
mE.  Denote the median PFS times for the standard and experimental therapies by mS and mE, 
respectively.  Under a Bayesian model, both mS and mE are assumed to follow Inverse Gamma(a, 
b) priors.   
 
12.2.1 Futility Monitoring f or the CR Subgroup  
From historical experience, it will be assumed that Prob(TS > 12 months) = 0.67, which implies 
that the median PFS is 20.77 months. Assume that mS follows an Inverse Gamma (28.96,  
580.77 ) prior, which has a mean of 20.77 and a variance of 16, and that mE follows an Inverse 
Gamma (3, 41.54) prior, which has the same mean of 20.77 months but a much higher variance 
of 431.5.  The possibly right -censored times TE will be monitored continuousl y throughout the 
trial.   Accrual into the CR subgroup will be terminated due to futility at any time if  Prob  (mS < 
mE | data) < 0.0785.  The operating characteristics of this monitoring rule were developed using 
the program TTEDesigner version 1.2.2, ava ilable from the MDACC Department of 
Biostatistics, assuming an accrual rate of 1 patient per month.  The operating characteristics 
(OCs) OCs for the CR subgroup rule are summarized in the Table 1.

36 0.02 23.8 
 
12.2.2 Futility Monitoring f or the no CR Subgroup  
For the NCR subgroup, under the Bayesian model, mS and mE follow Inverse Gamma(a, b) 
priors.  From historical experience, it is assumed that Prob(TS > 12 months) = 0.21, which 
implies that the median is 5.33 months.  Assum e that mS follows an Inverse Gamma (14.63, 
72.63) prior, which has a mean of 5.33 and a variance of 2.25, and that mE follows an Inverse 
Gamma (3, 10.66) prior, which has the same mean of 5.33 months but a much higher variance of 
28.4 months. Possibly righ t-censored TE will be monitored continuously throughout the trial. 
Accrual into the NCR subgroup will be terminated is at any time if Prob(mS < mE | data) < 
0.0795.  The OCs of this monitoring rule were developed using the program TTEDesigner v. 
1.2.2, ava ilable from the MDACC Department of Biostatistics, assuming an accrual rate of 1 
patient per month.  These OCs for the NCR subgroup rule are summarized in Table 2.

12.3 Secondary outcomes and data analyses   
Secondary outcomes will include disease -free survival (DFS) time, overall survival (OS) time, 
graft -versus -host disease, and 100 -day transplant -related mortality.  Within each subgroup, CR 
and no CR, these events will be tabulated and the distributions of DFS and OS time estimated 
using the method of Kaplan and Meier [2].  
12.4 Subject Disposition  
A summary of patient disposition will be provided for each cohort and will include the following:  
• Number of patients enrolled  
• Number of patients who participate in each study phase (induction, consolidation, 
maintenance)  
• Reasons for discontinuation from stu dy treatment and follow -up 
• Summary of major protocol violations  
12.5 Subject Characteristics  
Patient characteristics will be reported for each cohort, and will include a summary of the 
following:  
• Demographics  
• Baseline disease characteristics  
• Pre-existing c onditions  
Other characteristics will be summarized as deemed appropriate.  
12.6 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medication will be reported overall as well as summarized in a frequency table using 
the terms recorded on the CRF. If warranted, an attempt may be made to determine how 
concomitant medications are related to observed study outcomes.  
12.7 Response Outcome and Methodology  
Response criteria will be adapted from the International Working Group for AML, as stated in 
section 10.1.

 12.8 Safety Analyses  
All subjects will be evaluable for safety. Adverse events that occur after a subject is entered (signs 
informed consent), but before the patient receives study drug, will not be recorded on the CRF 
unless the investigator believes that the events may have b een caused by a protocol procedure. 
Safety analyses will include summaries of the incidence of adverse events by maximum CTCAE 
grade (version 4.03; NCI 2010) that occur during the study treatment period or within 30 days of 
the last dose of study treatment  or until alternate therapy is started, regardless of causality or 
relatedness to study drug. The safety -related outcomes that will be summarized include:  
• Adverse events,  
• TEAEs,  
• SAEs,  
• Deaths,  
• Discontinuations due to adverse events,  
• Extent of exposure to study drug treatment,  
• Hospitalizations,  
• Use of key concomitant medications.  
 
Analyses for data with discrete dates (for example, death date and start/stop dates of concomitant 
medications) will be performed through 30 days after the patient  has been discontinued from study 
treatment or until alternate therapy is started. Adverse events will also be analyzed in this time 
frame. After 30 -day post -discontinuation follow -up, only those SAEs that are thought to be related 
to study treatment or pr otocol procedure should be reported immediately to AROG or its designee. 
For these events, the patient must be followed until the event has resolved or stabilized.  
12.9 Criteria for End of Study  
This study will be considered complete following the data cut-off date for the final analysis.  
Documentation of the data cut -off will be included in the master study file.  
 
After the final analysis, if subjects are continuing to benefit from study treatment, they may be 
allowed to continue receiving study treatm ent for up to additional one year as part of planned 
maintenance.  
 
Patient is considered “off therapy” when study drug stops for any reason and crenolanib therapy 
is not continued.  
 
Patient is considered “off study” after completion of the 30 day safety follow up or upon death or 
upon start of a new therapy, whichever comes first.  
 
13. DATA QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
13.1. Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
Adverse events will be monitored during the treatment and post -treatment follow -up periods. 
Adverse events will be monitored on a continuous basis by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will conduct 
a biweekly teleconference with the study site to review safety data from this trial. A more frequent 
evaluation will be performed if accrual is rapid. The Sponsor and its medical consultants will

 convene to analyze the safety data at least every 3 months or when more than 20% (more than 1 
patient of the first 5 patients en rolled, more than 2 patients of the first 10 patients enrolled, or more 
than 3 patients of the first 15 patients enrolled) of the subjects require crenolanib dose reduction 
during t he first 2 cycles of therapy . The study will be halted, and t hese data will  be presented to 
the Sponsor’s safety monitoring team  to decide whether the crenolanib dose should be modified 
for all future patients. Enrollment will be halted if an apparent increase is observed in the 
occurrence of one or more of the following outcomes : 
 
• Early mortality due to any cause  
• Expected, non -hematologic, crenolanib -related toxicity (CTCAE Grade 4)  
• Unexpected, non -hematologic, crenolanib -related toxicity (CTCAE Grade 4)  
 
14.  PROTOCOL ADMINISTRATION  
Protocol amendments  
 
Changes to the pro tocol will be made only when protocol amendments have been signed by the 
principal investigator and approved by the sponsor and the IRB of the study center.  
 
Archival of data  
 
All patient data (including source data) generated in connection with this study  will be kept in the 
archives of each respective institution per policy or for at least 2 years after the approval of 
crenolanib. All data will be available for inspection by company representatives of the Medical 
Department and by regulatory authorities.

 Appendix I. Administrative Procedures  
 
Protocol Amendments, Other Changes to the Protocol  
 
Any change or addition to this protocol requires a written protocol amendment that must be 
approved by the investigator before implementation. Amendments significantly affecting the 
safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study, require 
additional approval by the IRB/IEC/REB of all centers , and, in some countries, by the regulatory 
authority. A copy of the written approval of the IRB/IEC/REB, which becomes part of the protocol, 
must be given to all the monitors and supporters of the protocol. Examples of amendments 
requiring such approval a re: 
 
1. an increase in drug dosage or duration of exposure of subjects  
2. a significant change in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group)  
3. an increase in the number of invasive procedures to which subjects are exposed  
4. addition or deletion of a test procedure for safety monitoring.  
 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken 
by the investigator in the interests of preserving the safety of all subjects included in the trial. If an 
immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by the investigator and is implemented by 
him/her for safety reasons, the sponsor should be notified and the IRB/IEC/REB at the center 
should be informed within 10 working days or per institutional policy.  
Ame ndments affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol 
amendments or IRB/IEC/REB approval but the IRB/IEC/REB of each center must be kept 
informed of such administrative changes. Examples of administrative changes not req uiring formal 
protocol amendments and IRB/IEC/REB approval that can be treated as administrative 
amendments include:  
 
1. changes in the staff used to monitor trials (e.g. AROG Pharmaceuticals staff versus a CRO)  
2. minor changes in the packaging or labeling of study drug.  
 
Publication of Results  
 
Any formal presentation or publication of data from this trial will be considered as a joint 
publication by the investigator(s) and appropriate AROG Pharmaceuticals personnel. Authorship 
will be determined by mutual agr eement. For multicenter studies it is mandatory that the first 
publication is based on data from all centers, analyzed as stipulated in the protocol, and not by the 
investigators. Investigators participating in multicenter studies agree not to present data  gathered 
from one center or a small group of centers before the full publication, unless formally agreed to 
by all other investigators and AROG Pharmaceuticals.  
 
AROG Pharmaceuticals must receive copies of any intended communication in advance of 
publicat ion (at least 15 working days for an abstract or oral presentation and 45 working days for 
a journal submission). AROG Pharmaceuticals will review the communications for accuracy (thus 
avoiding potential discrepancies with submissions to health authorities ), verify that confidential

2. US 21 Code of Federal Regulations dealing with clinical studies (including parts 50 and 56 
concerning informed consent and IRB regulations).  
3. Declaration of Helsinki and amendments, concerning medical research in humans 
(Recommendations Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects).  
4. The investigator agrees when signing the protocol to adhere to the instructions and procedures 
described in it and there by to adhere to the principles of Good Clinical Practice that it conforms 
to. 
 
Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
 
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed informed consent form and other 
information to subjects, must  be reviewed by a properly constituted Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee/Research Ethics Board (IRB/IEC/REB). A signed and dated 
statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by the IRB/IEC/REB must 
be given to A ROG Pharmaceuticals before study initiation.  Any amendments to the protocol, 
other than administrative ones, must be approved by this committee.

 Informed consent  
 
The investigator must explain to each subject (or legally authorized representative) the  nature of 
the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and 
benefits involved and any discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that 
participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may wi thdraw from the study at any time 
and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relationship 
with the treating physician.  
 
This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, written in n on-
technical language. The subject should read and consider the statement before signing and dating 
it, and should be given a copy of the signed document. If the subject cannot read or sign the 
documents, oral presentation may be made or signature given by  the subject’s legally appointed 
representative, if witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that the patient could 
not read or sign the documents. No patient can enter the study before his/her informed consent has 
been obtained.  
 
The in formed consent form is considered to be part of the protocol, and must be submitted by the 
investigator with it for IRB/IEC/REB approval. AROG Pharmaceuticals supplies a proposed 
informed consent form, which complies with regulatory requirements and is con sidered 
appropriate for the study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the Investigator 
must be agreed to by AROG Pharmaceuticals before submission to the IRB/IEC/REB, and a copy 
of the approved version must be provided to the AROG Pharma ceuticals monitor after 
IRB/IEC/REB approval.  
 
Declaration of Helsinki  
 
The investigator must conduct the trial in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki. Copies of the Declaration of Helsinki and amendments will be provided upon req uest

Appendi x V. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
Life threatening: “Life threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the adverse event as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would 
result in t he patient’s death. “Life threatening” does not mean that had an adverse event occurred 
in a more severe form it might have caused death (i.e., hepatitis that resolved without hepatic 
failure).  
 
Hospitalization: Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious adverse 
event, although the reasons for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital 
admissions and/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered  adverse 
events if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled on the study, provided that 
it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study.  
 
Important medical event or medical intervention: Medical and scientific judgment sh ould be 
exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in a situation where important medical events may 
not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalization, disability or incapacity but 
may jeopardize the patient or may require medica l intervention to prevent one or more outcomes 
listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious.  
 
Examples of such events are:  
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone tre atment  
 Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine  
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
 Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia requiring blood trans fusion, etc.) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization  
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
 
Disease progression: Any events or hospitalizations that are unequivocally due to progression of 
disease must not be reported as serious advers e events.  
 
The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable possibility” 
that an adverse event may have been caused by the investigational product.  
 Time course of events and exposure to suspect drug: Has the patient actually received the 
suspect drug? Did the adverse event occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of suspect drug?  
 Consistency with known drug profile: Was the adverse event consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect dr ug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
Protocol ARO -009 version 2.0 
Crenolanib as maintenance for post -transplant AML patients                                    November 6, 2018  
 
_____________________________________________________________________________   
Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc.                      Confidential  42 
 pharmacological class? OR could the adverse event be anticipated from its 
pharmacological properties?  
 De-challenge experience: Did the adverse event resolve or improve on stopping or reducing 
the dose o f the suspect drug?  
 No alternative cause: The adverse event cannot be reasonably explained by another 
etiology, such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host, or environmental factors.  
 Re-challenge experience: Did the adverse event reoccur if the  suspected drug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? Laboratory tests: Has a specific laboratory 
investigation confirmed the relationship?  
 
A “reasonable possibility” could be considered to exist for an adverse event when 1 or more of 
these factors exist.  
 
In contrast, there would not be a “reasonable possibility” of causality if none of the above criteria 
apply, or if there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course, but any de -challenge (if 
performed) is negative or ambiguous, or there is  another more likely cause of the adverse event.  
 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as the following:  
 Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?  
 Is there a known mechanism?  
 
Ambiguous cases should be considered as having  a “reasonable possibility” of causal relationship, 
unless additional evidence becomes available to refute this.  
 
If true progression is determined by subsequent imaging, then the date of progression returns to 
the earlier date with increasing mass.

Sampling Collection and Processing Instructions   
 
• At the sampling time point, collect 10 mL of whole blood for each time point in an 
appropriately labeled red/orange -top tube containing thrombin and completely cover with 
aluminum foil to protect from light.  
• The whole blood will remain at room temperature until clotted (approximately 5 
minutes).  
• The serum will be separated from whole blood by centrifugation at 1500xG for 10 
minutes. Minimize light exposure during this process.  
• Prepare screw -capped  polypropylene collection tubes labeled wit h UPIN, date and time 
of collection.  
• The serum will be transferred to the appropriate tubes and covered with aluminum foil if 
not immediately frozen. Store at -80oC within 1 hour of collection.  
• Samples from each individual patient will be stored and batc hed for that patient. The date 
and time of sample collection, crenolanib dose, and date and time of the last crenolanib 
dose  should be recorded on the appropriate Pharmacokinetics Data Collection Form 
(Forms 1, 2, 3 and 4).

Bone Marrow Aspiration and Whole Blood Collection  
 
Sampling Schedule for Bone Marrow Aspirates  
Bone marrow aspirates for research purposes will be collected at the time of routine marrow 
sampling with 1 additional aspiration of about 5 ml drawn for study purposes and placed in 
heparinized cell preparation tubes. The following are suggested time points, and after the first 
induction, bone marrow should be performed at the discretion of the treating physician.  
• Screening  
• Maintenance : as per the institutional standard of care  
• When patient is determined to have  progressive disease by the treating physician (loss of 
CR/CRi).  
 
Sampling Schedule for whole blood  
One sample of 10 mL of whole blood for each time point is drawn and placed in heparinized cell 
preparation tubes for other correlative science research stud ies. See FORMS 5 or 6. Sample should 
be drawn at the following two time points:  
• Pre administration of first dose of crenolanib . 
• When patient is determined to have progressive disease by the treating physician.

 • BMA/Blood  will be done as per institutional  bone marrow aspiration protocol. Sampling will 
consist of up to 5 mL of aspirated BMA sample or 10 ml of whole blood placed in 
heparinized cell preparation tubes . 
• After collection of bone marrow or whole blood, store tube  upright at room temperature until 
centrifugation. BMA/Blood samples should be centrifuged within one hours of blood 
collection for best results.  
• NOTE: Remix the BMA/blood sample immediately prior to centrifugation by gently 
inverting the tube 8 to 10 time s. Also, check to see that the tube is in the proper centrifuge 
carrier/adapter.  
• Centrifuge marrow/blood sample at room temperature (18 -25ºC) in a horizontal rotor (swing -
out head) for a minimum of 20 minutes at 1500 to 1800 RCF (Relative Centrifugal Forc e). 
• After centrifugation, mononuclear cells and platelets will be in a whitish layer just under the 
plasma layer (see Figure 2 below). Aspirate approximately half of the plasma without 
disturbing the cell layer.  
• Collect cell layer with a Pasteur pipette ( provided by AROG) and transfer to 3 
cryopreservation tubes (provided by AROG) and centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Remove 
all liquid and either snap freeze cell pellet in liquid nitrogen or dry ice and  then store -80ºC 
immediately.  
• Samples from each indi vidual patient will be stored and batched for that patient. Please 
complete appropriate Data Collection Form (FORMS 5 or 6).

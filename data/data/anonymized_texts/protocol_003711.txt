BACKGROUND 
Approximately 10,000 enior center operate in the US and erve 1.25 million peron na:onwide.1 
Mot of their client have low income,2-4 and in NYC, 68% are non-Cacaian.5 Abot 10% have clinically igniﬁcant depreion5 bt mot receive no care6. We developed SMART-MH,7 a commnity care model that can be embedded in enior center to improve recogni:on of depreion, referral, and adherence to depreion treatment. We alo developed Engage, a tepped-care therapy, treamlined baed on the amp:on that a dyfnc:on of the reward network i central to the pathogenei of depreion and ing "reward expore" a it principal interven:on. Engage alo target nega:vity bia, 
apathy, and inadeqate emo:on regla:on if they act a barrier to reward expore.8 With or enior center partner and or mobile technology team, we redeigned Engage-M o that it can be ed in a grop format by licened clinical ocial worker (LCSW) of Senior Center. Mobile technology provide probe for client adherence and oﬀer to therapit eay to review mmary record of mood, ac:vity, and ocial interac:on that can be ed to target their eion. We have integrated the SMART-MH model and Engage-M into a comprehenive commnity care model "Reaching and Engaging Depreed Senior Center Client" (REDS). We will compare the performance of REDS with a comparion condi:on in for enior center, two randomly aigned to REDS and two to a comparion condi:on. The comparion center will e SMART-MH for recogni:on of depreion and referral to mental health ervice pl weekly grop mee:ng on "Wellne of Mind and Body" (W-MH). Or rela:onhip with the NYC Dept. for Aging (DFTA) oﬀer the opportnity to embed and rapidly deploy REDS in NYC Senior Center, and 
may make the REDS model part of a tainable ervice reimbrable by Medicare.  
STUDY DESIGN 
In repone to the large nmber of enior center client who ﬀer from ntreated depreion, we have 
partnered with the NYC Department for the Aging (DFTA) to develop SMART-MH, a commnity care model that can be embedded in enior center to improve recogni:on, referral, and adherence to depreion treatment. We alo developed and teted Engage, a tepped-care therapy treamlined to e "reward expore" a it principal interven:on baed on the amp:on that dyfnc:on of the reward 
network i central to the pathogenei of depreion. With or enior center partner and or mobile technology team, we redeigned Engage-M o that it can be ed in a grop format by licened clinical ocial worker (LCSW) of Senior Center. Mobile technology provide probe for client adherence and oﬀer to therapit eay to review mmary record of mood, ac:vity, and ocial interac:on that can be ed to target their eion. We have integrated SMART-MH and Engage-M into a comprehenive commnity care model "Reaching and Engaging Depreed Senior Center Client" (REDS). The peciﬁc aim of thi developmental project are to 1. Finalize the REDS protocol and ae feaibility of training; 2. Prepare an Opera:on' Manal; 3. Examine reach, feaibility, and acceptability of REDS; 4. Examine engagement of behavioral target and preliminary eﬀec:vene; and 5) Collect informa:on on REDS 
cot, barrier to implementa:on, and poten:al aving in health care :liza:on. We will randomly aign for enior center to oﬀer either Engage-M (N=40), the treatment oﬀered by REDS (1 individal and 8 weekly grop eion) or 8 grop eion "Wellne in Mind and Body" pl mental health referral (W-MH; N=20). The par:cipant will have clinically igniﬁcant depreive ymptom (PHQ-9&gt;10) and will be older and middle-aged adlt (55+); 12.6% of the NYC enior center client are aged 55-65 year. Client will be iden:ﬁed by enior center taﬀ trained in SMART-MH trategie. We will oﬀer addi:onal training to taﬀ of all center on SMART-MH otreach, depreion creening, and treatment engagement. We will train and provide weekly perviion to 2 or more LCSW per center of the two center aigned to Engage-M. We will not oﬀer training or perviion to enior center taﬀ leading the grop of W-MH bt we will provide overight o that client receive mental health referral and are 
 2
encoraged to aend weekly Wellne grop mee:ng. Or ﬁnding will et be ed in a R01 tdy to 
formally tet the feaibility, acceptability, eﬀec:vene, non-billable cot, and barrier of REDS beyond NYC. If proven eﬀec:ve, with adminitra:ve pport, REDS can be extended na:onally and pported by 
billable ervice. 
We will con:ne to work with enior center' taﬀ and or mobile technology team to ﬁnalize REDS for 
both Englih and Spanih-peaking par:cipant. We will record the training hor to achieve cer:ﬁca:on 
in Engage-M (part of REDS), and the cce rate of LCSW engaged by the enior center to oﬀer behavioral ervice. 
Acro condi:on we will evalate1) Reach Nmber of client creened with PHQ-9 core greater than 
or eqal to 10 v. all eligible for creening, and thoe who receive REDS or W-MH; 2) Feaibility Nmber of client who ini:ate therapy and reearch procedre (eion aended, martphone e); 3) Acceptability to client [Client Sa:fac:on Qe:onnaire 10,11 (CSQ), eion comple:on rate] at baeline, 6, 9, and 12 week. Sa:fac:on of LCSW, center taﬀ will be aeed every 6 month throghot the tdy. Benchmark Feaibility >80% will par:cipate in each eion of Engage-M. Acceptability Engage-M par:cipant will have a mean CSQ core &#8805; 3 (ot of 4) at the end of treatment. 70% of Engage-M client will enter their martphone ra:ng in more than 70% of tdy day (59 ot of the 85 day). 
We will be recri:ng 60 bject in total from all ite (WCMC only ite) and ix licened clinical ocial 
worker bject. 1. Recritment and referral orce We are working with Grace Brandi and Jaqelin Berman of the NYC Department for the Aging (DFTA) to plan implementa:on of the REDS project at 4 NYC enior center. Older and middle-aged (55+) enior center client with elevated depreive ymptom (LCSW training phae n=10 client; Eﬀec:vene Pilot n=60) will be recrited from the 4 
par:cipa:ng enior center. Client in the tartp phae, dring which LCSW are trained, will be recrited from each of 2 center randomly aigned to REDS (n=10) over a 4-month period. For the RCT, 20 client will be recrited from each of 2 center randomly aigned to REDS (n=40), and 10 from each of 2 center aigned to the Wellne grop pl mental health referral (W-MH; n=20) over approximately a 14-month period. We have choen to partner with enior center that repreent client from divere backgrond. Each partnering enior center docment at leat 800 ac:ve member each, with a daily par:cipa:on rate of at leat 200 member. Given an expected 10% rate of eligible client (PHQ-9 > 10), we expect at leat 80 client at each center to meet inclion criteria to be referred to the tdy. Exclding thoe with evere mental illne or demen:a a aeed via reearch meare, we an:cipate that over 60 client at each center will meet inclion criteria for the RCT. Thi tdy will recrit from for enior center overeen and fnded by the Department for the Aging in New York City. We e:mate that or ample will be imilar to the ample of the demographic proﬁle of NYC enior center member indicate a mean age of 76 year; 67% women; 32% White, 26% Hipanic, 23% Aian, 17% African-American, and 2% other. Spport ervice to inve:gator and project will be organized by the Reearch Method Core (RMC) Data Grop, directed by Dr. Banerjee aited by two data manager C. Pollari, MPH, and A. Ar:, MS, MPH. The Team will meet weekly to 1) review the pace and qality of data entering; 2) determine priori:e; and 3) provide conlta:on and condct analye. Inve:gator will join the Work Grop a needed to inform the Grop of their progre and need and to be directed to oﬀer their pecialized exper:e to other Center pported tdie. We have ed thi model cceflly over 20 year in or NIMH pported Center. Intrment Sharing The Interven:on Management Work Grop (IMG) of the Adminitra:ve Core conlt with inve:gator ing Center reorce to enre that they elect from mearement intrment ed in the Center' ongoing tdie o that relt can be compared acro tdie. Data Collec:on Form In addi:on to 
 3
harmonizing the elec:on of intrment acro tdie, inve:gator will alo be encoraged to e 
data element (e.g. demographic deﬁni:on and variable name) that have been ed on previo tdie. Thi again will harmonize the tdy data to allow eaier merging of data acro tdie for hypothei genera:on and exploratory analye for ftre tdie. Prototype Databae We have developed a rela:onal databae ytem and a tracking ytem in Microos Acce that erve a the prototype for implemen:ng each Center tdy databae. Or databae ytem enre that the procedre are tandardized and adminitered a intended by the deign and that the collec:on of other data element i tandardized. The tracking ytem monitor pa:ent appointment and aement and prodce report of miing and delinqent data. Data from Commnity Agencie We have worked with commnity agencie to facilitate the tranfer of de-iden:ﬁed data to Weill Cornell. Each agency compile pa:ent data from it databae (e.g., CMS OASIS, Medica:on, Service U:liza:on) according to or peciﬁca:on and remove iden:fying informa:on.

a poible ol:on, bt withot peciﬁc plan or inten:on). 2. Preence of pychiatric diagnoe other than nipolar, non-pycho:c major depreion or generalized anxiety diorder by SCID-V. 3.Severe or life-threatening medical illne (e.g., end tage organ failre). 
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
We will monitor depreive ymptom and fnc:oning for each par:cipant via clinical reearch 
aement throghot the tdy period. Feedback will be collected from par:cipant on their e of the data collec:on app. In addi:on, a DSMB board aembled for the en:re ALACRITY Center NIMH grant (1 P50 MH113838-01, PI Alexopolo) will review the tdy deign, IRB protocol, advere event, and interim report of the ongoing tdy. 
If inve:gator note increaing rate of advere event or icidal idea:on, we wold top the tdy. We 
do not an:cipate thi will be the cae. 
Some par:cipant may ﬁnd the daily qe:on of the HR applica:on boring or tedio, or they may be 
bothered by the phone baery age reqired to keep the app rnning, and may chooe to dicon:ne 
ing the applica:on or withdraw from the tdy. Par:cipant may become erioly medically ill and decide not to par:cipate. In addi:on, if new pychiatric ymptom develop or change in everity, we may recommend removal from the tdy and provide referral for the appropriate treatment needed. Referral will inclde pychotherapy or medica:on management referral in the commnity. 
Cornell reearch taﬀ will alo ae change in depreive ymptom at reglar interval. Pa:ent' 
health and clinical care will alway take priority over tdy par:cipa:on. Par:cipant may not want to 
con:ne comple:ng daily qe:on via the HR app and will be free to dicon:ne age at any :me. Par:cipant will alo have the op:on to diable celllar data e for the app throgh their device eung. 
 4
Stdy interviewer will be Weill Cornell reearch taﬀ who are trained in aement with older adlt. 
They will peciﬁcally inqire abot depreive ymptom, fall, and hopitaliza:on. Stdy therapit are alo trained to monitor the par:cipant' mental tate and will report ymptom everity to Weill Cornell taﬀ and the principal inve:gator. If any moderate to evere ymptom change (or new ymptom) are noted, we will conider alterna:ve op:on to maximize the par:cipant' well-being. In addi:on, we will ak all par:cipant abot the brden of ac:ve and paive ening and daily martphone age, to iden:fy any poten:al nega:ve coneqence of ing the HR app. We do not expect any addi:onal rik 
of advere event by adding ac:ve and paive ening data collec:on.  
Referral to external mental health agencie will be oﬀered to par:cipant who drop ot of the tdy in 
order to addre any ongoing depreive ymptom. For thoe bject who are removed from the tdy de to ac:ve icidal idea:on or clinically worening ymptom of depreion referral will be provided for the appropriate treatment needed. Referral will inclde pychotherapy or medica:on management referral in the commnity. 
The tdy will adhere to the advere event grading gideline provided by Weill Cornell' Oﬃce of 
Reearch Integrity and Arance. All advere event will be reported to the Weill Cornell IRB in the :meline indicated by the Weill Cornell Hman Reearch Protec:on Program Immediate Repor:ng Policy. 
We will periodically report advere event to the DSMB, in addi:on to repor:ng to the IRB a per Weill 
Cornell' policy.

Data were g raphically examined to check for ou tliers as well as distri bution fo r continuous outcomes. 
Identified ou tliers were ma nually ch ecked and co rrected if needed. For the outcom es that wer e 
generated from ques tionnaire items such as SCI, DFC and PedsQL, when subjects had on ly a few missin g 
items, the missing item valu es were imputed using the v alues with highest fr equency, and the im puted 
items were used to calculate the final sco re for the sub ject. As a sensi tivity analysi s, we performed 
multiple im putations to examine sensitivity to missing data. 
 
Baseline d ifferences in de mographic and clinical v ariables betwe en the Education and PA groups wer e 
compared using Chi- square test for categorical v ariables and W ilcoxon rank sum te st for continuou s 
variables. The prim ary analyses were p erformed us ing multip le linear regressions with adjustment o f 
covariates and PA group as the main eff ect. The following a priori selected covariates we re adju sted in 
each analysi s: age, sex, baseline depres sive symptoms, and baseline me asurement for each outcome. All 
analyses were p erformed u sing the programming language R version 3.3 .0

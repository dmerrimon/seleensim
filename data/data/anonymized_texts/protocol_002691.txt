overdoses in the US, approximately  70% of  which involved  opioids.1 Medication  for opioid use  disorder (MOUD) is  currently the most  
effective intervention  for OUD;  MOUD such as buprenorphine  are currently being  delivered  in tandem  with adjunctive  behavioral  
therapies in opioid treatment  programs  (OTPs)  throughout  the country.  
 
In spite of the  proven  efficacy of  MOUD,  42% of  people who begin  an MOUD discontinue  them within 24  weeks2 and 50% of people  
retained  in MOUD have an opioid  relapse  within six months.3 As such, novel  and efficacious behavioral  adjuncts  to MOUD are  needed to  
improve adherence to medication, improve  treatment outcomes, and  reduce relapse in individuals  seeking treatment  for OUD. The NIH  
HEAL  initiative  has focused  attention  on behavioral  research  to improve  medication -based  treatment of OUD. Among behavioral  
interventions being considered, mindfulness -based  interventions  (MBIs) have been highlighted by NIH  to have particular  promise as  
adjunctive treatments for OUD. However,  MBIs and other  extant behavioral  treatments  for OUD require  significant face -to-face contact  
and human resources —barriers to  treatment accessibility  that also  increase  the risk  of treatment dropout.  Therefore, novel  treatment  
strategies are needed to  help overcome  this crisis.  One strategy  would  include treating  OUD with digital health technology  in order to  
improve treatment retention  and outcomes.  Thus, our overall  goal is to develop  and pilot test  a new digital therapeutic strategy  based on  
an Mindfulness Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), an empirically -supported MBI for OUD. Specific aims for  this project are:  
 
Aim 1: To determine  the detailed functional, technical,  and customization requirements  to translate  the MORE program  into a  virtual  
experience,  and to adapt  therapeutic  material from  the published MORE  treatment manual66 so that it  can be delivered via a virtual  
reality (VR) platform. This program  will be referred to as MORE -VR. 
 
Aim 2: The MORE -VR prototype  will be developed  from the program designed in  Aim 1. Initial testing of the prototype  will be  conducted  
by patients to evaluate safety, usability,  and satisfaction – as well as changes  in proximal  outcomes ( opioid  craving,  positive affect ).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7. Is this a multi -site study,  where  more  than  one site needs  IRB approval?  
 Yes 
 No 
 
8. Background  and Introduction:  
MOUD  treatment outcomes may be subverted  by the  allostatic effects of  opioids on brain stress and reward  circuitry.  Allostatic models  
posit that prolonged use  of opioids to alleviate  affective  distress may shift hedonic set  points in corticostriatal brain circuitry mediating  
reward and disrupt emotion regulatory capacity,  compelling opioid  use as a  means  of preserving  a dwindling sense of  well-being. Thus,  
OUD involves  a process  of hedonic homeostatic dysregulation,  in which the  motivation  to obtain  natural  rewards  is re-organized around 
seeking  drug-associated  reward  and the desire to  alleviate aversive  states  (e.g.,  affective  distress).4 Consequently, opioid -related cues  
come  to usurp the  salience of cues predicting  natural,  non-drug rewards, evident by heighted  opioid cue-reactivit y in corticostriatal  
circuitry  including orbitofrontal  (OFC) and  anterior cingulate cortex  (ACC); and  the ventral  striatum  (VS)5–7 - propelling  opioid  craving  
and relapse.8,9 Unfortunately,  among  people treated with MOUD,  blunted reactivity  to non -drug rewards  has been observed  in brain 
regions  including the  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex (PFC)10 and ventral  striatum11 – suggesting that  reward  deficits  remain untreated by  
the most effective  first-line medications for OUD.  Further,  a recent review  found that there  are no efficacious pharmacotherapies for 
treating  opioid -related reward deficits.12 As such, to  improve  outcomes among  people with  OUD,  novel  interventions are needed  to 
remediate  hedonic dysregulation in brain reward  circuitry.  
 
To that e nd, Mindfulness -Oriented  Recovery  Enhancement (MORE), a  cognitive  training  intervention  generated by a NIDA -funded  
treatment  development  process (R03 →R34→R01),  has shown significant promise.  Rooted  in affective neuroscience, MORE unites  training  
in mindfulness, reappraisal,  and savoring  skills to remediate  dysregulation in brain reward systems underpinning opioid misuse  and OUD.  
In one Stage  1 (N=30)13 and two Stage  2 RCTs (N=11514 and N=9515), as well  as in a newly  completed R01 -funded  Stage 2/3 RCT  
(N=260),  MORE significantly decreased  opioid misuse and opioid  craving  by modulating  opioid cue-reactivity  and amplifying  natural  
reward processing in  the brain16 , demonstrating the efficacy of  the face -to-face intervention for OUD. Yet, the MORE  intervention,  which  
must be delivered  by trained clinicians, requires significant human  interaction  and is therefore  resource intensive.  Further,  in light of the  
COVID -19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent  to engage in  face-to-face interventions  due to the risk of  viral spread.  
 
Virtual  reality  (VR) can  overcome  these implementation  barriers.  VR environments  help serve  to reduce  the logistical, social, and  
psychological barriers to MBIs  and traditional  learning environments (e.g.,  traveling  to a specific place, feeling  self-conscious while  
practicing mindfulness, or stigma associated with the intervention). Also,  VR avatars  will provide  a supportive learning community  for 
self-guided  learners who need  structure when establishing  a new routine such  as regular mindfulness  practice.  An additional benefit  of 
VR is that it is  more scalable and disseminable  compared with human teachers  and usual “brick and  mortar” learning environments.  
Given recent technological advances and associated decrease in  cost of VR  hardware,  VR may be readily accessed in  a variety  of 
environments. The ability  for a user  to access VR-driven  digital therapeutics in a clinic and then to  have continuity  of that intervention  in 
the home environment  may facilitate repetition of skill  practice,  consolidating learning  and potentially boosting  therapeutic  
neuroplasticity.17,18 
In that regard, the premise of  this application is that delivering  MORE  via virtual reality   (MORE -VR) will provide  an efficacious and highly  
disseminable  form of this evidence -based intervention  to improve MOUD outcomes. In addition  to overcoming  implementation barriers,  
VR tcan aid in  mindfulness -based cognitive  and affective training  by removing sensory distractions  that may otherwise hinder the learning  
process,  personalizing patient experience  with machine learning and  biometric feedback, and  encouraging  interaction  and imagination     
in an immersive virtual environment.19,20  Through  these features, VR  will increase  the perceived usability  of the  intervention,21     
helping  to bridge the  gap between  in-person and  digital learning  environments  and increasing  treatment engagement.22,23

records,  who can refer  participants  to the study,  where  will flyers  be posted,  how often  will recruitment  
letters  be sent,  when  will follow -up phone  calls  be made,  etc.):  
Recruitment efforts will be  focused on reaching  potential participants at the University of Utah health care system , and  Highland  
Ridge  Hospital, a substance use outpatient treatment  program  serving ~360 unique OUD  patients a year. We will also  recruit  
participants  from other OUD  treatment programs  in the  Salt Lake Valley.  Participants  may be referred to the study  from a  
healthcare  provider,  or may self-refer after reviewing  study marketing  materials.  We will work closely with  provider  partners  
within  the University  of Utah, from Highland Ridge  Hospital, and other  OUD treatment providers to educate staff regarding the  
study,  establish referral  processes,  and provide  marketing  materials.  
 
In addition  to marketing within the healthcare environment, advertisements,  marketing  materials,  and website links  may be 
displayed at community  locations  or posted on media  platforms of interest  to the general community.  Marketing  materials include  
those  attached in the  documents and attachments section  of this application.  
 
Provider  Refe rrals  
  
10 of 26  7/14/2023,  3:02 PM  
  
 
A provider  may choose  to refer a potentially  eligible  participant directly  or provide  marketing materials for self-referral.   If a 
provider gives  a referral  to the  study team directly,  he or  she will be trained  to ask permission from the patient  for the study  
coordinator/assistant  to contact them  prior to sending contact  information to the study  team.  
 
We will also use the Enterprise  Data Warehouse  (EDW)  at the University of Utah to identify potentially eligible  participants through  
an initial search and will receive  updated information on an ongoing  basis. We will also use the Human Subjects Recruitment  Tool 
to identify  potentially eligible participants. Participants  identified  by the EDW or Human  Subjects Recruitment  Tool will first be  sent 
an introductory letter via  MyChart prior to being contacted by a  member of the  study team inviting  them  into the study.  
 
Self-Referral  
 
Potential participants will have multiple avenues  for self-referral  after learning  about the study.  
 
▪ Call a research  coordinator/assistant  
 
▪ Email  a general  inbox  to reach  a research  coordinator/assistant  
 
▪ Click  a link to our website:  www.socialwork.edu/painstudy  
 
▪ Scan  a QR code  with their smartphone  camera  
▪ This option  connects  the participant  with a pre-screening  survey  that allows  them  to gain more  
information  about  the study  and answer  a few short  questions  to determine  eligibility,  and then leave  
their contact  information  for study  personnel.  
 
 
Medical  Record  Review:  For patients within the University of Utah covered entity,  the research  team has access to  medical records  
and may conduct a  chart review once notified  of a potentially  eligible  participant through  any of the above meth ods. Patient  name,  
MRN,  date of birth, phone number,  address,  and email will be recorded for the purpose of recruitment.  
 
Use of the Human  Subjects Recruitment  Tool (HSRT): The Principal Investigator or his study  staff may utilize  the HSRT  to review  
the electronic health records  at the University  of Utah clinics to  determine if potentially  eligible patients are attending  scheduled  
appointments.  If so, the PI, coordinator,  or research  assistant  may attempt  to meet the  patient at the clinic  at the time  of their 
appointment to inform them about  the study,  pre-screen for eligibility,  and schedule a full study informed consent  appointment.  
 
No information collected during  the study will  be added to patient  records.  
 
 
 
 
5. How will consent  be obtained?    
Informed  Consent  Process  (with  or without  a document)  
 
6. Describe  all the procedures  chronologically,  from  screening/enrollment  through  study  closeout,  which  will be 
completed  in the research  project.  
This project is funded  by the National Institute  on Drug Abuse  (NIDA) as a  SBIR grant.  BehaVR, LLC is the prime  awardee  and the  
University of Utah is BehaVR's academic  partner for this project, as a  subawardee.  BehaVR will develop  the MORE -VR virtual reality  
system  with funding from NIDA. The  University  of Utah will c onduct  an initial pilot test of  this system via the proposed study  below:  
 
1. A sample of 30 patients receiving  MOUD will  be recruited from University of Utah Healthcare System,  Highland  Ridge Hospital, or self- 
referral.  
 
2. At the time of initial contact  with the research team, the Principal  Investigator,  Study Coordinator,  or Research  assistant  will explain  
the study  and invite  potential participants to ask questions. Potential  participants will then be screened for eligibility.   Psychiatric  and 
substance  use disorders will be assessed with the  Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI),  a structured interview 
with good inter-rater and test-retest reliability.67 Opioid withdrawal  will be assessed  with the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale  
(COWS) .69 
3. Informed  consent will  be obtained from all eligible participants.  
 
4. Following screening and informed consent, eligible participants  will be assessed for baseline clinical characteristics with the Addiction  
Severity  Index, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale  (DASS), the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription Medications,  and other  
Substances  (TAPS), the Snaith Hamilton  Pleasure and Anhedonia Scale  (SHAPS) , Metacognitive Processes of  Decentering 
Scale  (MPODS), the Nondual Awareness  Dimensional Assessment, the Ways  of Savoring Checklist, and  the Emotion 
Regulation  Questionnaire.  
 
5. Next,  the sample (N=30) will participate  in 8 weekly treatment sessions with the MORE -VR system. The VR system  consists of  
commercially  available  VR goggles  (e.g.,  Oculus Rift) linked with a  VR platform consisting of  a cloud -based control software that 
orchestrates the content  of VR sessions in real -time.  The VR content  is based on  Dr. Garland’s  validated  Mindfulness -Oriented  Recovery  
Enhancement  (MORE) protocol, published  in 2013 (Garland, 2 013, Mindfulness -Oriented Recovery  Enhancement  for Addiction, Stress,  
and Pain. NASW  Press: Washington,  DC.). Each session of MORE -VR will last approximately  1.5 hours, and a research staff will be  
present  at each VR session, who  will teach the participant to use  the system and answer any questions  that arise.  
 
6. The VR system will capture trace data through logs that capture behavioral  engagement with each intervention  component. These will  
include  the number of  digital object manipulati ons, clicks,  and eye tracking of fixation duration on digital objects  
 
7. At the 8 weekly MORE -VR sessions, the  following measures will be administered, for  a total of 8 assessments:  
 
a) Craving  will be evaluated  with a Numeric Rating Scale and the Desires for  Drug Questionnaire,72 and affect will be evaluated with the  

  
11 of 26  7/14/2023,  3:02 PM  
 
 
 
Positive and Negative  Affect  Scale (PANAS).73 
b) Coping  self-efficacy  will be  measured with the  Drug Taking  Confidence  Questionnaire,74 which predicts heroin  relapse.75 
c) Mindfulness  will be evaluated  with the Toronto  Mindfulness Scale76 as a therapeutic  process measure and  manipulation check.  
 
d) Participants will complete a daily symptom diary of  opioid craving, drug use  and mood symptoms as well as mindfulness skills via  
ecological mom entary assessments (EMA) delivered  via the participant's  own smartphone or home  computer up to  3 times per day  
(morning, noon and  evening).  
 
 
e) Also at this post-treatment  assessment, we will again administer the following questionnaires:  the DASS, the TAPS , SHAPS , 
MPODS,  NADA, the Ways of  Savoring Checklist, and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire.  
 
f) Participants will participate in a semi -structured qualitative interview (sample questions attached as an additional  document) about  the 
acceptability  of the  MORE -VR system (e.g.,  "What  did you like best? What didn't  you like?"  "What would  you change?"). The  interview 
will be audio -recorded and transcribed  for analysis of intervention  acceptability.  
 
g) Safety will be assessed throughout to monitor adverse events.

◆ Yes 
 No 
If no, list the procedures  that are performed  for research  purposes  only (non -standard  or non-standard

 Yes 
 No 
 
9. Provide  a summary  of the statistical  methods,  data analysis,  or data interpretation  planned  for this study.  
Factors  for determining  the proposed  sample  size (e.g.,  power)  should  be stated.  
For this Phase I  pilot focused  on usability,  satisfaction and safety,  we are not powered  to detect a change  in proximal  outcomes or  
mechanistic  measures. Yet, the repeated -measures nature of our  design affords comparatively high statistical power.  With 8  
measurement  points and a moderate  repeated  measures correlation (r=.30), we will have power of .90 to detect  a medium effect size 
for the simple fixed effect of tim e (Cohen’s f=.25) with N=30.  We assume at  least a medium effect  size based on  the large effects of  2 15 2 
time observed among participants  treated with  MORE  in prior RCTs for craving,60 ηpartial  =.24, and  positive affect,  ηpartial  =.39.  
 
Safety will be  evaluated  with the sequential probability ratio  test (SPRT)83 following updated  guidelines for  small, single arm  trials.84,85  
Changes  in craving,  affect, and physiology  (HR, HRV, GSR) across the 8  sessions will be assessed with linear  mixed  models (LMM) with  
  
12 of 26  7/14/2023,  3:02 PM  
  
 
 
Kenwood -Roger degrees of freedom.  Simple LMM  with small  sample sizes can provide  unbiased estimates  of fixed effects with  minimal  
inflations  in type I error.86 Because  this is a non -experimental  Phase I pilot study,  the fixed effect of time  will be the parameter of 
interest,  controlling for OUD severity  as a covariate.  LMM will specify a  random  intercept, and random  slopes and/or  autoregressive  
repeated  covariances  if needed and supported  by the Bayesian  Information Criterion. However,  given  the small N, we  will not over fit 
models  to the point of saturation  – models will be  simple as possible. Little’s  MCAR test will  determine if data  are Missing Completely at  
Random (an ideal that  is rarely  met with  longitudinal data). There  is no definitive test for Missing at  Random,  which describes  data that  
are random  conditional on observed  data. We will use restricted maximum likelihood  estimation (REML) procedures to deal with  missing  
data according to an  intent -to-treat philosophy  that is  robust against common  patterns of missing  data. REML is based  on all data  
observations; no values  are deleted. Sex  differences in treatment response will be examined by including sex as  a biological variable  of 
interest  in analytic models.

The consent  process  will be performed  by the study  investigators,  study  coordinator,  or research  assistants.  Dr. Garland  
will not obtain  consent  from participants.  A potentially -eligible  individual  will schedule  a time to meet  with a member  of 
the research  staff,  either  in-person  or using  a HIPAA -compliant  virtual  meeting  platform  such  as zoom,  at which  time the 
person  obtaining  consent  will explain  the protocol  in detail  and will review  and discuss  the consent  form with the 
potential  participant.  The personnel  who obtain  consent  will inform  participants  of Dr. Garland's  financial  conflict  of 
interest  in this study.  If the potential  participant  appears  confused  or indicates  she does  not understand  the consent  
forms,  the interviewer  will attempt  to identify  what  the individual  does  not understand  and explain  the consent  again.  If 
the potential  participant  appears  confused  or indicates  that they do not understand  the consent  forms,  the interviewer  
will attempt  to identity  what  the individual  does  not understand  and explain  the consent  again.  The potential  participant  
will be offered  up to 72 hours  to make  a decision  to participate.  If the potential  participant  elects  to enroll,  the Principal

1. Privacy  Protections:  Privacy  refers  to persons  and to their interest  in controlling  access  of others  to themselves.  Privacy  
can be defined  in terms  of having  control  over the extent,  timing  and circumstances  of sharing  oneself  (physically,  
behaviorally,  or intellectually)  with others.  What  precautions  will be used  to ensure  subject  privacy  is protected?  
Select  all that apply:    
The research  intervention  is conducted  in a private  place  
 
Discussing  the study  with participants  individually  instead  of in front of a group  
 
The collection  of information  about  participants  is limited  to the amount  necessary  to achieve  the aims  of the research,  so 
that no unneeded  information  is being  collected  
 
De-identification  of photos,  audio  tapes,  or video  tapes  of the participant  that will be made  during  the study  
 
Other  or additional  details  (specify):  
All materials  derived  from the study  will be handled  only by study  personnel  during  collection,  storage,  and in 
subsequent  data analysis.  The PI is experienced  in conducting  clinical  studies  and is fully aware  of the need  for 
anonymity,  privacy  and security,  and maintains  strict  surveillance  of the office  environment.  No incidents  of violation  of 
patient  confidentiality  have  occurred  in the previous  studies  in which  the PI has participated  over the past 10 year 
period.  
 
Protection  of Participant  Identity  and Confidentiality.  The following  confidentiality  
protection  steps  will be taken:  1) all members  of the research  team  will participate  in initial  
training  and follow -up training  in medical  and research  ethics;  2) consent  forms  will be 
maintained  in password  protected  REDCap  databases;  3) any personal  identifiers  linked  to data will be removed  and 
replaced  by code  numbers  in all records;  4) any information  suggesting  that privacy  has been  breached  will be 
thoroughly  investigated  by the PI and reported  promptly  to the IRB. 
 
Audio -recordings  of interviews  will be destroyed  one year after completion  of the project.  
2. Confidentiality  Precautions:  Confidentiality  is an extension  of the concept  of privacy;  it refers  to the subject's  
understanding  of, and agreement  to, the ways  identifiable  information  will be stored  and shared.  Identifiable  information  
can be printed  information,  electronic  information  or visual  information  such  as photographs.  What  precautions  will be 
used  to maintain  the confidentiality  of identifiable  information?  
Select  all that apply:    
Storing  research  data on password  protected  computers  or in locked  cabinets  or offices

Use Disorder

1. Describe  the reasonable  foreseeable  risks  or discomforts  to the participants:  
 
All reported symptoms that subjects attribute  to the study interventions  will be documented  and investigated  by the  PI (who has over a 
decade  of clinical expertise  with persons with  substance  use disorders and  chronic pain, as  well as clinical research  experience through 
several NIH-funded clinical trials), and  reported  immediately to the University of Utah IRB. Risks associated  with mindfulness meditation  are 
minimal.  There is no  evidence that mindfulness worsen  the symptoms ca uses complications with  opioid  therapy.  The relaxation experienced  
as part of mindfulness  training  is sometimes associated  with transient  sleepiness, lasting  no more than a  few hours.  
 
Participation in mindfulness meditation may also increase  awareness  of anxiety.  Participants  will be  advised to inform the therapists  of any 
significant  shift in their symptoms for  the worse while taking part  in the interventions.  Reports  of such changes will be given to the PI, who  
will coordinate to interview the subject  and make  a determination of  need concerning specific medical care or  removal  from the study.  Events  
of this type are very uncommon, usually transient and pose minor  barriers to the  completion of this study.  
 
Participants may  interpret the  interventions  as su bstitutes for  usual, conventional  medical  
care. All participants will  continue to receive  the same medical care from their physician  that 
they would otherwise receive.  They will be informed that they  should continue  such care just  
as if they were not enrolled in a  study.  Participants  will be  asked  to inform  study personnel if  
there  is a change  in medications or other  medical care during  the trial (both  during treatment 
and follow -up), but patients and their physicians  will not be dissu aded from changing medical  
management  practices.  
 
While  strict precautions will be  implemented to protect patient confidentiality  (detailed in the  
data monitoring plan in  section 5 of the  IRB application), there  is the potential  risk of a loss  of 
confident iality. Because potential participants will  be asked  about  drug use, this could pose a risk  to the participants given  the illegal nature  
of their actions.  
 
The consent form will clearly specify that it is the option of  the PI and the research team  to withdraw  a subject from the  study should they  
prove to be a  danger to self or  others, or a  significant disruption to  the group.  If participants  appear intoxicated  (as determined by meeting  
DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for  alcohol, cocaine, opioid, amphetamine , or hallucinogen  
intoxication) or actively  suicidal during study assessments or VR sessions, they will not  be allowed to continue that session. Instead, they will  
be referred to the  appropriate University  of Utah  Primary Care Clinic  or Highland Ridge  Hospital to receive  medical  evaluation  by a physician,  
brief intervention  by a psychologist  or social worker,  and more extensive mental health services,  as needed. Alternatively,  if the participant is  
determined  to be a danger to self or others due  to suicidal ideation or intoxication,  university  police will be alerted.  Afterward,  the PI will  
contact  the participant in  question and interview them  to determine whether  their substance use  warrants  exclusion  from the  study.  
 
Another  risk relates to  the potential for cybersickness,  which is a  side effect associated  with the use of  VR technology.  Cybersickness  is 
associated  with a range of symptoms including nausea,  dizziness, disorientation, headaches,  sweating, and/or eye strain.  
 
The final risk relates  to the measurement protocol.  Because the virtual  drug cue exposure  and negative  emotion regulation protocols involve  
the presentation of opioid - related  cues and stressful  experiences, there is  a risk that  they could trigger opioid  cravings  and psychologic al 
distress.  Yet, it is very unlikely  that such craving  or distress will  exceed that which would occur on an  everyday  basis, given  that opioid cues  
(e.g.,  the sight  of a heroin  needle) are present in  participants’  natural  environments.  To monitor for poten tial risk, participants will be asked  
to rate their stress  and craving  on two  10-point visual analogue  scales (1 =  none, 10 = extreme)  before and after  the virtual cue exposure  
and negative  emotional regulation  protocols, and then again  at the end  of the assessment  session. In the unlikely event  that participants  
report  stress or craving resulting from cue exposure  as determined by  an elevation  in craving  or stress by  3 points from  baseline levels  that 
maintains  at the end of the  assessment, the PI will notify  the University  of Utah IRB, and make  a referral  for clinical services, as appropriate.  
To mitigate this risk, the Study  Coordinator/Research  Assistant (a master’s  level social worker)  will be trained  by the PI (a licensed clinical  
social  worker  and clinician  with over 16 years of experience) to  debrief participants, assess  risk, and provide  15 minutes of progressive  
muscle  relaxation to ensure  subjects have experienced a  reduction in stress  or craving  to a level of within  3 points of  their baseline level on 
the visual analogue scales  upon beginning the psychophysiological protocol. In two  four RCTs of MORE with persons with  substance use  
disorders,  the PI used  a similar risk management  strategy  for a psychophysiological  cue-reactivity  protocol,  and no participants  
remained  distressed after this  procedure.

2. Describe  the potential  benefits  to society  AND  to participants  (do not include  compensation):  
 
While  it is possible that  there may be no  direct benefits to participants, the  potential benefits  
of the research to  the participants are significant.  Their craving  or stress may improve significantly as a result  of being part  of the study.  
The process of participating  in the MORE -VR could  enhance  self-efficacy.  Participants may  learn improved methods of managing OUD  from 
each other’s  experience. Therefore, it  is expected that participants may experience significant benefit  from participating in  the research  
study.  The potential benefits  to other individuals with  OUD are also  significant. The results  of this research may provide  credible evidence  
about  the effects of MORE -VR for patients with OUD and whether it may be usefully integrated  with conventional  care in order  to effectively  
manag e opioid misuse and  addiction.  
 
 
4. Is there  any compensation  to the participants?  
 
◆ Yes 
 No 
a. If yes, answer  the following:

b. Specify  when  participants  will be paid (e.g. at each  visit,  at end of study,  etc.):  
Participants  will be paid at each  visit. 
c. If applicable,  please  specify  payment  by visit or other  time interval  (e.g. $10 per visit,  etc.):  
Participants  will be paid $25 for the baseline  and post-treatment  assessment,  $20 per MORE -VR session,  plus an 
additional  $40 bonus  for completing  5 or more  MORE -VR sessions.  
d. If applicable,  explain  plan for prorating  payments  if participant  does  not complete  the study:  
Payment  will be prorated  according  to how many  study  sessions  are completed.  3.  Are there  any costs  to the participants  from  participation  in research?  
 
 Yes 
 No

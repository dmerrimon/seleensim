Study  Title  
Mindful  Movement  for Physical  Activity  and Wellbeing  in Older  Adults:  A Community  Based Randomized  
Hybrid  Effectiveness -Implementation  Study  
 
Objectives  
The broad  long-term objective  of this research  is to optimize  physical  activity  levels  in middle  to older  age 
adults  (>50 years)  using  an integrated  mindfulness  and behavioral  approach,  which  can be  scaled  for 
dissemination  nationwide.  We will work  with the YMCA  Greater  Twin  Cities,  a community  based  
organization.  To overcome  the problematic  lag between  research  discovery and  translation,  we will use an 
innovative  hybrid  effectiveness -implementation  design.   
 
Design  and Outcomes  
We will conduct  a Randomized  Controlled  Trial  (RCT,  n=182)  to determine  the relative  effectiveness  of two 
educational  programs,  Mindful  Movement  versus  Keys to Health & Wellbeing  (Aim  1) by assessing  the 
following:  
• Primary  physical  activity  outcome:  time spent  per week  in ≥ 10 minute  bouts  of moderate -
vigorous  physical  activity  (MVPA)  at 9 weeks;  
• Secondary  physical  activity  outcomes:  time spent  per week  in ≥ 10 minute  bouts  of MVPA  at 26 and 52 
weeks;  time spent  per week  in MVPA  and sedentary  activity;  and steps  per day at 9, 26, and 52 weeks.  
• Secondary  self-report  measures:  quality  of life, exercise  self-efficacy  and expectations, mindfulness,  
wellbeing,  bodily  pain,  physical  activity,  social  connectedness  and assurance,  intervention  satisfaction,  
and adverse  events  at 9, 26, and 52 weeks.  
 
To facilitate  interpretation  of the RCT  results  and provide  resources  for translation  and sustainability,  we will 
collect  and describe  complete  contextual  data within  the RCT  at the participant,  facility  and organizational  
levels  and create  a web-based  implementation  toolkit  that can be used by other  sites (Aim  2). 
 
Interventions  and Duration  
The duration  of the interventions  is 8 weeks.  One additional week, a pre -intervention session, (i.e., Week 0) is 
included to introduce & orient participants to the remote Zoom, group environment. The interventions  are group 
educational  programs,  Mindful  Movement  (experimental  intervention)  versus  Keys to Health &  Wellbeing  
(control  intervention),  both facilitated  by YMCA staff facilitators.  
 
Sample  Size and Population  
We will enroll  182 participants  50 years  of age and older.  
 
1. STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Overview  
Physical  inactivity  is a significant  public  health  problem  associated  with increased  risk of disabling  medical  
conditions,  chronic  disease  and mortality,  as well as diminished  wellbeing.1-3 Despite  recommendations  to 
engage  in at least 150 minutes  per week  of moderate  to vigorous physical  activity  (MVPA),  most  older  adults  
do not.4,5 There  is also growing  attention  on the detrimental  health  effects  of sedentary,  very low energy  
activities.6-8 There  are many  theoretical  mechanisms  underlying  older  adults’  physical  and sedentary  behaviors,  
Page 20 V10 February 2021  
  which  when  considered in  aggregate  relate  to individuals’  capacity,  motivation,  and opportunity.9 Specific  
theory  based behavioral  strategies,  especially  those  that are self-regulatory  and provide  social  support,  have  
demonstrated  effectiveness  in positively  affecting  health  and activity  behaviors.7,10,11  Emerging evidence  also 
suggests  mindfulness  based  interventions  (MBI),  incorporating  mindfulness meditation,  can be helpful  for 
addressing  challenges  related  to initiating  and engaging  in healt h behaviors12-14 including  physical  activity.15,16  
With  a focus  on non-judgmental,  present -oriented awareness,  MBIs  can facilitate  self-regulation  of attention  on 
immediate  experiences,  thoughts and  emotions  with an orientation  of openness,  curiosity,  and acceptance.17 
MBIs  may also help older  adults’  navigate  common  negative  exercise -related  experiences,  expectations,  and 
beliefs. However,  there  is a void in research  examining  MBIs  for health  behaviors  including  physical  and 
sedentary  activities.  
 
The broad  long-term  objective  of this research  is to optimize  physical  activity  levels  in middle  to older  age 
adults  (>50 years)  through  Mindful  Movement , an integrated  mindfulness  and behavioral  approach,  which  can 
be scaled  for dissemination  nationwide.  We will work  with the YMCA  Greater  Twin  Cities,  a community  
based  organization,  which  provides  opportunities  to “build  healthy  spirit,  mind,  and body  for all” and has made  
healthy  aging  a strategic  priority . Together,  with a multi -disciplinary  team,  we will refine  and test a multi -level  
“Mindful  Movement”  program  comprised  of mindfulness  practices  and evidence  based  behavioral  strategies  to 
facilitate  activity  related  behaviors.  To overcome  the problematic  lag between research  discovery  and 
translation,  we will use an innovative  hybrid  effectiveness - implementation  design18 comparing  Mindful  
Movement  to a Keys to Health & Wellbeing  education  program  adapted  from  previous  research.19 
 
1.2 Primary  Objective  
Aim 1: To determine  the relative  effectiveness  of 8 weeks  of Mindful  Movement  versus  Keys to Health & 
Wellbeing  in a Randomized  Controlled  Trial  (RCT,  n=182)  as measured  by changes in primary  physical  
activity  outcome:  time spent  per week  in ≥10 minute  bouts  of moderate -vigorous  physical  activity  (MVPA)  at 
9 weeks.  
 
1.3  Secondary Objectives  
Aim 2: To determine  the relative  effectiveness  of the two interventions  as measured  by changes in:  
a. Secondary  physical  activity  outcomes:  time spent  per week  in ≥ 10 minute  bouts  of MVPA  at 26 and 52 
weeks;  time spent  per week  in MVPA  and sedentary  activity;  and steps  per day at 9, 26, and 52 weeks.  
b. Secondary  self-report  measures:  quality  of life, exercise  self-efficacy  and expectations, mindfulness,  
wellbeing,  bodily  pain,  physical  activity,  social  connectedness  and assurance,  intervention  satisfaction,  and 
adverse  events  at 9, 26, and 52 weeks.  
   
Aim 3: To facilitate  interpretation  of RCT  results  and provide  resources  for translation  and sustainability  by: 
 
a. Collecting  contextual  information  to inform  eventual  broad  scale  intervention  implementation.  This includes 
assessment  of participants (including  follow  up rates  for self-reported  outcomes,  and barriers  and facilitators  to 
interventi on and study  participation); facility (including  staff adherence  to recruitment  and intervention  
protocols;  confidence  in protocol  and intervention  delivery;  perceived  barriers  and facilitators  to intervention 
and study  implementation); and organizational (including  leadership  views  regarding  intervention  and study  
relevance, practicality,  affordability,  and acceptability;  intervention  related  costs).  
b. Creating  a web-based  implementation  toolkit  that can be used by other  sites.

1.1 Hypotheses  
Our primary  hypothesis  is that there  will be a significant  advantage  (>56 minutes)  in terms  of the primary  
outcome  measure,  weekly  minutes  spent  in >10 minute  bouts  of MVPA  for Mindful  Movement  over the Keys 
to Health & Wellbeing.  
 
Our secondary  hypotheses  are: 
• There  will be a significant  advantages  of Mindful  Movement  over Keys to Health & Wellbeing  in terms  of 
the secondary  objective  outcome  measures  of time spent  per week  in ≥ 10 minute  bouts  of MVPA;  time spent  
per week  in MVPA  and sedentary activity;  and steps  per day 
• There  will be significant  advantages  of Mindful  Movement  over Keys to Health & Wellbeing  in terms  of the 
secondary  self-reported  outcomes:  quality  of life, exercise self-efficacy  and expectations,  mindfulness,  
wellbeing,  bodily  pain and physical  activity  
• There  will be no significant  advantages  of Mindful  Movement  over Keys to Health & Wellbeing  in 
terms  of the secondary  self-reported  outcomes  of social  connectedness  and assurance,  and 
intervention  satisfaction  
 
2. BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
2.1 Background  on Condition,  Disease,  or Other  Primary  Study  Focus  
This  project  addresses  the significant  challenge  of engaging  middle  to older  age adults  in physical  
activity . By using  a rigorous  hybrid  randomized  effectiveness -implementation  design, we  will test a ‘Mindful  
Movement’  program  with our collaborators at the  YMCA  Greater  Twin  Cities  (YMCA  GTC),  the third  largest  
YMCA  in the United  States. The  YMCA’s  strategic  priorities  include  improving  wellbeing  through  all stages  
of life and developing  socially  responsible  communities  by embracing  diversity  and inclusion.  With  a 
membership  of more than 300,000  locally  and 22 million  nationally  and the ability  to attract  non- members, the  
YMCA  has great  reach.  Furthermore,  the YMCA’s  commitment  to providing  geographically and  financially  
accessible  resources  and facilities  greatly  enhances  the potential  for this project  to positively  impact  the 
physical  activity,  health,  and wellbeing  of a large  and diverse  population.  
 
Physical  inactivity  is a global  health  concern  with profound  consequences.  Physical  inactivity  has reached  
pandemic  proportions,20,21  and is defined  as a level  insufficient  to meet current  recommendations  for at least 
some  health  benefits  ( 3.3 METs:  150 minutes  of  moderate  aerobic  physical  activity  per week  OR  6.0 METs:  
75 minutes  of vigorous  aerobic  physical  activity  per week  OR an equivalent  combination  of both,  with bouts  of 
activity  at least  10 minutes  in duration).  With  nearly  a third  of the world’s  population  failing  to meet  minimal  
recommended  physical  activity  levels,22 the health  and economic  consequences  are sobering.  The negative  
impacts  of physical  inactivity  approximate  those  of smoking  and obesity,21 and it has been  estimated  that up to 
10% of all deaths  from  non- communicable  diseases  are due to insufficient  physical  activity.21  In the US, costs  
attributable  to physical  inactivity  were  $500 billion  in 2003  and estimated  to exceed  $700  billion  in 2008.23 
Conversely,  there  are many positive  benefits  of physical  activity,  including  reduced  risk of chronic  diseases  and 
falls,  and improved  function,  quality  of life, and wellbeing.20,21  It has been  estimated  that inactive  American  
adults  could  gain up to 4 added  years  from  age 50 by becoming  active21,24,25  and that even  modest  activity  (e.g. 
15-30 minutes  per day of brisk  walking)  would  confer  health benefits.1,20,26 
Page 22 V10 February 2021  
   
Sedentary  activities  carry  important  health  risks  independent  of physical  activity . While  substantial  
attention  has been  paid to physical  inactivity,  it is only relatively  recently  that focus has  been placed  on 
sedentary  behaviors,  defined  as engagement  in very low energy  activities (<1.5  METS)  including  sitting  or 
reclining  at work,  home  or during  commuting  and leisure  times.  Time  spent  sedentary  has been associated  with 
higher  risk of physical  frailty,6 metabolic  syndromes,  and mortality.7,8 Noteworthy  is that participation  in high 
levels  of MVPA  fails to fully  mitigate  risks  of prolonged  sedentariness.6,7 These  studies  suggest  that 
interventions  should not  only target  increased  physical  activity  but also concomitant  reductions  in sedentary 
behaviors.  
 
Physical  inactivity  and sedentary  behavior  is a major  concern  for middle  to older  age adults.  With  the 
U.S. older  adult  population  rapidly  growing,  increased  attention  is being  paid to middle  to older  age adults’  
physical  and sedentary  behaviors.27 Physical  activity recommendations  for older  individuals  are the same  as for 
their younger  counterparts.1,20,26  A total  of 150 minutes  per week  in MVPA  is recommended  for some  health  
benefits,  and 300 minutes  per week  is recommended  for greater  health  benefits.28 Regular  walking  is among  the 
most  common  physical  activities  engaged  by older  adults,  and generally  meets  the criteria  for moderate  
intensity  physical  activity.29 Recent  evidence  shows  the majority  of middle  age to older adults  fall alarmingly  
short  of recommendations  for physical  and sedentary  activities.  In the recently  published  work  by Hooker  et al,4 
75-90% of time was spent  engaged  in sedentary behavior,  10-23% in light physical  activity,  and only 0-2% in 
MVPA.  Only  3 to 12% of participants  reached  > 150 min/week  using  the recommended  10 minute  bout 
criterion.4 
 
Qualitative  studies  have  found  that many  older  adults  associate  exercise  with potentially  negative  effects.30 
Further,  some  carry  the belief  that health  declines  are inevitable,  leading  to less investment  in preventive  
behaviors,  and subsequent  health  declines.31 Importantly,  older  adults with  multiple  chronic  conditions  (a 
common  occurrence  with advancing  age32) are at higher  risk for  negative  perceptions  about  aging,  and sedentary  
behavior.  These  perceptions  contrast  with recommendations  for exercise  (including  aerobic  forms)  irrespective  
of age, comorbidity,  pain severity,  and disability.33 
 
2.2 Study  Rationale  
There  is evidence  to support  several  behavioral  strategies  for optimizing  physical  activity. Initiating  and 
sustaining  engagement  in physical  activity  is complex,  and is influenced  by many factors.9 One model  of 
behavior  useful  for understanding  physical  and sedentary  activities  is the COM -B model,  which  addresses  
capabilities , opportunities,  and motivations  related  to behavior. Capability  refers  to the abilities  required  to 
enact  a behavior  and opportunity  refers  to the physical  and social  environment  that facilitates  the behavior.  
Motivations  include  reflective  mechanisms  (e.g. beliefs  about  what  is good  and bad, conscious  intentions,  
decisions,  and plans) and  automatic  mechanisms  (e.g. emotional  responses,  desires,  impulses,  and habits  
resulting from  associative  learning  and physiological  states)  that facilitate  or inhibit  behaviors.9 
 
Systematic  reviews  of behavioral  interventions  for promoting  changes  in physical  activity  have  found  evidence  
for social  support  and the use of well-described  behavior  techniques,  particularly those  focused  on self- 
regulation  (e.g. goal setting,  prompting,  self-monitoring,  providing feedback  on performance,  and goal 
review).10,34  Of note is the recommendation  that individual behavior  techniques  be combined  as part of a 
coherent  intervention  in which  theory,  strategies, and  goals  are aligned.9,10,35 
 
Page 23 V10 February 2021  
  Research  is beginning  to emerge  using  this approach  in older  adult  populations.  In the RCT  by Burke  et al 
(n=478),36 a 6 month,  home  based  intervention  which  included  an informational  booklet,  goal setting,  e-mail 
and phone  reminders,  resulted  in significant  improvement  in self- reported  physical  activity  in 60-70 year old 
participants.  A recent  cluster  RCT  of nearly  300 individuals  60-75 years  of age37 tested  a program  focused  on 
key behavioral  strategies  (goal - setting,  self-monitoring,  building  self-efficacy  social  support,  barrier  and 
relapse  prevention,  and habit  building)  to encourage  walking.  A significant  increase  compared  to the control  
was observed  in daily  steps  and 10 minute  bouts  of MVPA  at 3 and 12 months,  with no adverse  events.  These  
studies  suggest  that behavioral  strategies  to enhance  physical  activity  are appropriate  for use in older  adults,  
and warrant  further  investigation.  
 
Mindfulness  based  interventions  (MBIs)  are among  the top five commonly  used complementary  and 
integrative  health  (CIH)  practices  in the U.S.38 Mindfulness  Based  Stress Reduction  (MBSR)  is the most  
popular  and formalized  of the mindfulness  programs,  stemming from  Jon Kabat -Zinn’s  early  work  that 
introduced  systematic,  secular  training  in mindfulness.17,39  MBSR  and many  MBIs,  are offered  as group  format  
interventions  focused  on education,  training,  practice  and social  support  in mindfulness  meditation.  
Mindfulness  is considered  a ‘meta -cognitive’  skill (cognition  about  one’s  cognition)40 which  has been  
described as  “the awareness  that arises  by paying  attention,  on purpose,  and non-judgmentally,  to present  
moment  experience”.41  Mindfulness  can be developed  through  meditation  training  and practice  aimed  at 
enhancing  attention  regulation,  body  awareness,  emotional  regulation , and shifts  in self-perception ,42 all 
potentially  important  and useful  skills  for engaging  in healthy  behaviors.  
 
The number  of studies  investigating  MBIs  is rapidly  increasing  and there  is growing evidence  for MBIs’  
synergistic  neurobiological  and behavioral  mechanisms.  This includes mechanistic  studies  demonstrating  the 
ability  of MBIs  to positively  affect  brain  regions  and functions  necessary  for regulating  attention,  emotion  
and pain,  as well as body  awareness  and self-perception.42,43  While  a recent  evidence  map of 81 systematic  
reviews  of MBIs44 has found  generally  positive  clinical  outcomes  for a range  of health  issues,  there  is a 
scarcity  of research focused  on investigating  the effectiveness  of MBIs  for enhancing  optimal  health  
behaviors.  
 
However,  the little research  that has been  performed  is promising.  Emerging  evidence  suggests MBIs  
incorporating  mindfulness  meditation,  can be helpful  for addressing  challenges  related  to initiating  and 
engaging  in health  behaviors.12,13,45  This includes  promising  work  incorporating MBIs  to enhance  physical  
activity.15,16  A small  randomized  controlled  trial (RCT)  of 19-64 year olds  (n=62)  found  that 4, 2 hour MBI  
workshops  resulted  in significant  increases  in self-reported physical  activity  at 6 months  compared  to controls.  
Another  recent  RCT  of 30-50 year olds15 (n=138),  found  that 9, 90 minute  sessions  of mindfulness  combined  
with Acceptance  and Commitment  Therapy  improved  physical  activity  self-efficacy  and discomfort  acceptance 
compared  to feedback  alone.  And while  no studies  have  yet examined  MBIs  for encouraging physical  activity  
behaviors  for mid to older  age adults  exclusively,  preliminary  qualitative  research  found  that older  adults  
(mean  age 74 years)  with low back  pain who participated  in an 8 week  MBSR  program,  perceived  beneficial  
changes  in body  awareness  resulting  in behavior change.46 Overall,  the encouraging  results  of these  studies,  
coupled  with the growing  evidence  base regarding  MBIs  neurobiological  and behavioral  mechanisms,  suggest  
it is the right  time for rigorous  studies  coupling  mindfulness  approaches  with evidence -based  behavioral  
strategies  for ameliorating  physical  inactivity  and sedentary  behaviors  in mid to older  age adults.  
 
There  are several  theoretical  mechanisms  by which  mindfulness  skills  may improve  physical  activity . 
Barriers  to physical  activity  often  include  entrenched  ideas,  including  beliefs that  exercise  is painful  and even  
physically  harmful.47 In practicing  movement  with mindfulness,  participants  learn  to intentionally  pay 
Page 24 V10 February 2021  
  attention  (attention  regulation ) to their physical  
sensations  (increasing  body  awareness ), with an 
attitude  of friendliness  and curiosity.  This can lead  to 
shifts  in perception  in which  MBI  participants  are 
surprised  and even  pleased  as enjoyable  sensations  of 
movement  come  to the foreground  of their attention,  
and discomfort  or pain  shifts  to the background.  Such  shifts  
could result  in shaping  behaviors  or actions  towards 
physical  activity  engagement  rather  than avoidance.  
The cognitive  flexibility  afforded  by mindfulness  may also 
pave the way for the application  of other  behavioral  skills,  
including value  based  goal-setting  and action  planning.  
Non- judgmental  awareness  may aid in relapse  
management,  where  relapses  are viewed  with 
neutrality  and compassion.47 Further,  coupling 
muscular  activity  with an internally  directed focus  can 
facilitate  interoceptive  attention  to bodily  
sensations.48,49  50-52 This suggests  that mindfulness  techniques  are indeed  well suited to  integrate  with all types  
of physical  activity, with  potential  reciprocal  effects  (e.g. mindfulness  can facilitate  activity,  and activity  can 
facilitate  mindfulness).12 
 
MBIs  could  also lead to increased  physical  activity  through  attenuation  of other  common  barriers including  
avoidant  impulses  and habitual  thinking  which  prevent  initiation,  engagement,  and maintenance.47,53,54  By 
encouraging  individuals  to become  aware,  they can open  to the possibility that  allowing  such habits  to dictate  
behavior  is contrary  to wellbeing.  Further,  in facilitating  a time interval  where  one is able to observe  thoughts,  
feelings  and sensations  non-judgmentally,  as opposed  to negatively,  mindfulness  can lead to the formation  of 
different  appraisals  and behavioral  choices  (e.g. engaging  in activity  versus  avoiding  it, etc).13 Thus,  through  
practice  in mindfulness,  mid to older  age adults  can moderate  activities  appropriate  for themselves.  They can  
also actively  respond  to rather  than automatically  react  to the emotions  (emotional  regulation)  or thoughts  
that may arise  when  confronted  with barriers  to physical  activity engagement.  Overall,  our underlying  
theoretical  framework  for the Mindful Movement  Program  can be summarized  using  the COM -B model.9 By 
providing  education, training  and practice  in mindfulness  meditation,  and evidence -based  behavioral  strategies,  
we will enhance  mid to older  age adults’  capabilities  and skills  required  to engage  in healthy physical  activity  
behaviors.  These  will serve  to activate  positive  motivations  including  those  that are reflective  (e.g. beliefs,  
conscious  intentions,  decisions,  and plans)  and automatic  (e.g. emotional  responses,  desires,  impulses,  and 
habits)  and inhibit  negative  ones.  Importantly,  by integrating  the program  within  the YMCA,  a community  
based  organization  that offers geographically  and financially  accessible  resources  and facilities  in socially  
supportive  environments,  we will provide  mid-older  age adults  from  all backgrounds  opportunities  to facilitate  
physical  activity  related  behaviors,  and enhance  their overall  health  and wellbeing.  
 
3. STUDY  DESIGN  
To speed  the translation  of research  to practice  there  has been  increasing  interest  in study  designs  and strategies  
that work  to balance  methodological  rigor  with generalizability.  This includes  the emergence  of hybrid  
effectiveness -implementation  designs,18 and other  frameworks,55 which  blend  rigorous  clinical  research  
approaches  alongside  implementation  research  methods  to facilitate  adoption  by providers  and systems.  
 

Page 25 V10 February 2021  
  We will use a hybrid  randomized  design  which  simultaneously  tests the intervention  and the implementation  
using  rigorous  methods  to provide  valid  estimates.18 To facilitate  the future  implementation  of the Mindful  
Movement  intervention  to YMCA  and other  community  based settings,  we used the “Reach,  Effectiveness, 
Adoption,  Implementation  and Maintenance”  RE- AIM  framework  to inform  the design.55  
 
3.1 Overview  
This is a  randomized  controlled  trial. It uses a hybrid  effectiveness -implementation approach  and is informed  
by the RE-AIM  framework,  to facilitate  intervention  uptake  and sustainability.18,55 This study has the  following  
aims:  
 
Aim 1. To determine  the relative  effectiveness  of 8 weeks  of Mindful  Movement  versus  Keys to  Health  & 
Wellbeing  (n=182)  as measured  by changes in primary  physical  activity  outcome:  time spent  per week  in ≥10 
minute  bouts  of moderate -vigorous  physical  activity  (MVPA)  at 9 weeks.  
 
Aim 2. To determine  the relative  effectiveness  of the two interventions  as measured  by changes in:  
a. Secondary  physical  activity  outcomes:  time spent  per week  in ≥ 10 minute  bouts  of MVPA  at 26 and 52 
weeks;  time spent  per week  in MVPA  and sedentary  activity;  and steps  per day at 9, 26, and 52 weeks.  
b. Secondary  self-report  measures:  quality  of life, exercise  self-efficacy  and expectations, mindfulness,  
wellbeing,  bodily  pain,  physical  activity,  social  connectedness  and assurance,  intervention  satisfaction,  
and adverse  events  at 9, 26, and 52 weeks.  
 
Aim 3. To facilitate  interpretation  of RCT  results  and provide  resources  for translation  and sustainability  by: 
 
a. Collecting  contextual  information  to inform  eventual  broad  scale  intervention  implementation.  This 
includes assessment  of participants (including  follow  up rates for self-reported  outcomes,  and barriers  
and facilitators  to intervention  and study  participation); facility (including  staff adherence  to recruitment  
and intervention  protocols;  confidence  in protocol  and intervention  delivery;  perceived  barriers  and 
facilitators  to intervention and  study  implementation); and organizational (including  leadership  views  
regarding  intervention  and study  relevance, practicality,  affordability,  and acceptability;  intervention  
related  costs).  
b. Creating  a web-based  implementation  toolkit  that can be used by other  sites.  
 
 
4. SELECTION  AND  ENROLLMENT  OF PARTICIPANTS  
4.1 Definition  of “Participants”  
The nature  of a hybrid  effectiveness/implementation  design  warrants  participation  of subjects  at different  levels.  
Participant  level.  Participants  will be randomly  allocated  to participate  in experimental  (Mindful  
Movement)  or control  (Keys to Health & Wellbeing)  interventions,  and will take part in baseline  
and post- intervention  quantitative  and qualitative  data collection  activities.  
Facility  level.  These  individuals  include  those  who work  at the YMCA  (e.g. staff),  but are not in 
leadership  positions.  These  individuals  will be asked  to volunteer  to participate  in qualitative  data 
collection  to provide  important  contextual  information  that could  affect  implementation  of the 
Page 26 V10 February 2021  
  interventions  in the long term.  
Organizational  level.  These  individuals  have the potential  to influence  YMCA’s strategic  planning  (e.g. 
hold leadership  positions).  Similar  to the facility  level  subjects,  these  individuals  will be asked  to 
volunteer  to participate  in qualitative  data collection  to provide  important  contextual  information  that 
could  affect  implementation  of the interventions  in the long term.  
 
 
4.2 Eligibility  Criteria  
All participant  level  subjects  taking  part in the RCT  must  meet  all of the inclusion  criteria  and none  of the 
exclusion  criteria  by the time of enrollment  (randomization  at or following  BL2)  to participate  in this study.   
 
4.2.1 Inclusion  Criteria

Deaconess  Questionnaire).  
• Folstein Mini  Mental  Status  Exam  (MMSE) ≥ 24 for those with suspected cognitive decline.  
 
 
Additionally , the following  describes  inclusion  criteria  for the other  subject  levels  who provide  important  
contextual  information  required  as part of the hybrid  effectiveness/implementation  design  and RE-AIM  
framework.  
• Potential  participant  level  subjects  must  be 50 years  of age and older  and willing  to participate  in 
qualitative  data collection.  
• Facility  level  subjects  must  work  at the YMCA  (e.g. staff),  but are not in leadership  positions,  and 
willing  to participate  in qualitative  data collection.  
• Organizational  level  subjects  are defined  as individuals  at the YMCA  who influence  the strategic  
planning  of the organization  (e.g. hold leadership  positions)  and willing  to participate  in qualitative  
data collection.  
 
4.2.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
Exclusion  criteria  are summarized  below;  see manual  of operations  for further  operationalization:  
• Pregnancy  (self-report  of current  pregnancy  or trying  to get pregnant)  
Page 27 V10 February 2021  
  • Unwilling  or unable  to participate  in study  activities  (not able and willing  to attend  baseline  study  
visits;  not able and willing  to wear  the accelerometer  daily  for at least 10 hours  per day on 7 days;  not 
able and willing  to complete  self-report  questionnaires  unassisted,  using  electronic  or paper  formats, 
[includes  English  literacy];  cannot  commit  to attending  >70%  of intervention  sessions via 
videoconference*)  
• Current or upcoming participation in educational programs similar to those  under study  
• Medical  restrictions  to increasing  MVPA  (Participant  self-report  AND  health  care provider  does 
not provide  clearance  to participate) ** 
• Terminal illness  
• Contraindications  to mindfulness  practices:  
o Serious  mental  health or brain  conditions  (bipolar  disorder,  schizophrenia,  psychotic  disorder  or 
problems,  Alzheimer’s,  dementia,  major  depressive  disorder, major anxiety disorders). Self -report  
of diagnosis  by a health  provider  AND  health care provider does not provide clearance to 
participate ** 
o Suicidality  (score  of > 2 on the suicidal  ideation  screen  from  the Quick  Inventory  of Depressive  
Symptomatology -Self Report  (QIDS -SR)56 
o Substance  abuse  (self-report  of substance  abuse  at time of screening  as measured  by affirmative  
responses  to screening  questions  of drinking  more  alcohol  or using  more  drugs  than intended  in 
the past 6 months  AND  feeling  the need to cut down  on alcohol  use or drugs)  
o PTSD  (self-report  of diagnosis  of PTSD  AND  health  care provider  does not provide  clearance  to 
participate) ** 
o Seizure disorder. Self -report of diagnosis by a health provider AND  health care provider does not 
provide clearance to participate ** 
 
*Participants can participate even if they do not have the appropriate electronic hardware and/or internet 
access. These individuals will be identified during screening and provided the necessary technology resources 
(e.g. computer tablet, mobile hot spot device, etc.). Electronic devices will be formatted by UMN staff to all ow 
participants to participate in screening activities, the study interventions, and data collection. Enrolled 
participants can keep this equipment. Participants who disqualify during the screening process will be asked to 
send the equipment back to the un iversity in a postage -paid package.  
 
To reduce potentially negative impacts on recruitment we will only send devices/tablets to individuals who have 
completed a thorough initial screening; this will minimize the amount of mailing back and forth of devices  since 
the majority of individuals will likely qualify at this point. Additionally, the time window between initial 
screening and baseline 1 is sufficiently long enough (90 days) to accommodate shipping and returns.   
 
We feel there is an advantage of havin g potential participants try using Zoom prior to randomization; by 
experiencing the Zoom environment they can make better informed decisions regarding participation. In doing 
so, we anticipate increased intervention engagement and fewer withdrawals.     
 
 
Page 28 V10 February 2021  
  ** Healthcare provider clearance: participants who may have contraindications to mindfulness practices or 
medical restrictions to increasing MVPA  (as determined by assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria during 
screening) need written clearance from thei r medical provider to participate in the study. The medical waiver 
includes information about the study purpose, the funding agency, a list of potential risks and contact 
information for the study team. Participants are instructed to review the waiver with  their medical team and 
return the signed waiver (by mail, fax or scanned) to the study team prior to randomization. Medical waivers are 
secured in the participant’s research file. Those who are not able to obtain this necessary clearance cannot 
participat e. 
 
4.3 Study  Enrollment  Procedures  
4.3.1 Identification  of Candidate  Participants  
Participants  will self-identify  in response  to various  solicitation  methods  (see below).  Private  medical  or 
protected  records  will not be accessed for screening.  Participants  will be recruited  from  the Twin  Cities  and 
surrounding  metropolitan  communities.   
 
4.3.2 Recruitment  of Candidate  Participants  
Participant  level  subjects : Consistent  with normal  YMCA  practices  and to enhance  our reach  to a diverse  study  
population,  we will recruit  from  all YMCA  sites in the Twin Cities,  as well as in the general  community.  We will 
reach  Twin  Cities  wide  YMCA  members  through  routine  communication  channels  including  monthly  general  
news  emails;  ‘healthy  aging  focus’  e-mails  to target  age groups;  the YMCA  website  and social media;  
announcements  in ongoing  YMCA  classes;  and posters  distributed  within  the YMCA  facilities. We  will also 
recruit  non-members  from  the general  community  via the YMCA’s  usual  marketing methods  (e.g. postal  
mailings),  and will work  in collaboration  with local  clinics and other community partners,  located  in proximity  to 
the participating  YMCA  sites to facilitate  referrals.  Additionally, we will use existing data from the UMN 
Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI, NIH UL1TR000114) Clinical Data Repository (CDR) hosted 
by the Academic Health Center Information Exchange (AHC IE). This data originates from the Elect ronic Health 
Records of patients of Fairview Health Services and University of Minnesota Physicians and currently includes 
over 2.3 million patients who have consented to have their data used for research. Eligibility criteria in this study 
will be applied  to the data repository.  
 
In addition,  recruitment  of Facility  Level  Subjects  (YMCA  staff)  to participate  in qualitative  data collection  will 
occur  through  system -wide  and targeted  e-mails,  newsletters,  routine  organizational  meetings  and special  
presentations (in -person or remotely via tele -and videoconferencing).  Recruitment  of Organizational  Level  
Subjects  (YMCA  Twin  Cities  leadership,  including  decision  makers  and board  members)  will occur  via routine  
meetings  and communications (in -person or r emotely e.g., via tele -and videoconferencing),  special  presentations  
and targeted  e-mails.  
 
Minority  Recruitment  Efforts :  
Based on data gathered in the R21 phase, we learned that greater attention needs to be paid to addressing the 
barriers that currently exist to minority participation in research, as well as mindfulness based interventions. 
Common barriers include distrust of research, (e.g., fears about study procedures, lack of knowledge regarding 
mindfulness and wellbeing interventions, etc.), little perceived benefit to community, and conflicting time 
demands. To address these barriers we have updated our recruitment pla ns. This includes working closely with 
YMCA leadership (Dr. Hedy Lemar Walls , Chief  Social Responsibility Officer -YMCA of the Greater Twin 
Cities , Bruce Yang  Director of Social Responsibility -YMCA of the Greater Twin Cities) to coordinate 
Page 29 V10 February 2021  
  community listeni ng sessions and additional study information meetin gs. 
 
Community listening sessions : we have dedicated investigator and staff to meet in -person or remotely (e.g., via 
tele-and videoconferencing) with community stakeholders to better understand community n eeds, align values, 
and share information about the study and potential benefits of community participation. Identification of the 
stakeholders and facilitation of the community listening sessions will be conducted in partnership with the 
YMCA leadership ( e.g. Dr. Lemar Walls and Mr.Yang). Listening sessions began in the R21 phase, and will 
continue through the R33, as screening and interventions continue to be implemented at the participating YMCA 
sites (see approved SARP).  Information gained in the liste ning sessions have been and will be used to inform 
revisions to recruitment related study materials (e.g. flyers, newsletters, informational meeting materials, etc.). 
The timing of community listening sessions will continue to be coordinated in a manner th at allows for necessary 
approvals prior to use (e.g. participant -facing R33 materials require IRB approvals, and any affected changes to 
the R33 protocol require NCCIH and IRB approvals).        
 
Study information meetings : we have dedicated investigator and staff to perform study information meetings  
(in person or remotely via tele - and videoconferencing)  to enhance outreach and recruitment at YMCA sites that 
typically draw from minority communities. Study information meetings will be held 1 -12 weeks prior to the 
beginning of screening from specific YMCA sites as well as with interested community partners  (see approved 
SARP).  Study personnel will provide information about the study, research procedures and terminology, and 
offer an opportunit y for potential participants and family members to ask questions. To better navigate the time 
constraints of potential participants, the informational meetings will be held at convenient times (e.g. in the 
evenings following work hours). IRB approved study  materials and information provided in these meetings will 
be guided by recommendations from the community listening sessions (as described above).   
 
In addition, we  will seek guidance  from  the University  of Minnesota’s (UMN)  Recruitment  Center  to ensure  a 
diverse  study  population.  The Recruitment  Center  assist researchers  with attaining  recruitment  goals  using  UMN  
partnerships,  technologies  and resources.  StudyFinder,  for example,  extracts  data from  UMN  affiliated  enrolling  
studies  listed on  ClinicalTrials.gov  and provides  potential  participants  a simple  way to identify  studies  that need  
volunteers.  ResearchMatch  is an electronic  volunteer  recruitment  registry  that also provides information  about  
UMN  studies  and allows  persons  interested  in research  participation  to self- register.  Strategies  include  
advertising  in minority -oriented  community  newspapers  (e.g.,  Latino American  Today,  Hmong  Times)  and 
hanging  posters  and flyers  in University  of Minnesota  and other  community  clinic s serving  large  minority  
populations.  
 
The YMCA  also has numerous  partnerships  with organizations  in the Twin  Cities  who represent  women  and 
minorities  and are in close  proximity  to participating  YMCA  sites.  This includes  the Native  American  
Community  Clinic;  Smileys  Family  Medicine  Clinics  (serving  a large  Somali  population),  and Westside  
Community  Clinic  (also  known  as La Clinica  serving  a predominantly Hispanic  population).  Further,  the 
YMCA’s  Diversity,  Inclusion,  and Global  (DIG)  Council  which  is charged  with the responsibility  for creating  a 
welcoming  and accessible  environment  to participants  of all ages,  genders,  cultures,  abilities  and backgrounds,  
will serve  as a resource  for reaching  out to minorities  for the project.  
 
Compensation : All program  fees are paid for by the study.  Participants  will be compensated for  time associated  
with participating  in this study  sessions  after they are enrolled.  The maximum  compensation  for completing  all 
study  sessions  is 210.00.  Details  of compensation  procedures  are included  in the manual  of operations  and are  
addressed  in the informed  consent  form.  
Page 30 V10 February 2021  
  4.3.3 Documentation  Procedures  
A comprehensive  list of all subjects  screened,  how they heard  about  the study,  whether  or not they were  
enrolled,  and the reasons  for ineligibility  or non-participation  (if applicable)  will be maintained  electronically.  
 
4.3.4 Consent  Procedures  
Consent  will be sought  from  all participants  by the PI, or designees  (e.g. trained  study  staff).  All individuals  
seeking  consent  from  potential  study  candidates  are required  to complete  the University  of Minnesota’s  Human  
Subjects  and HIPAA  related  training.  Documentation  of consent  at the following  levels  will be recorded  by 
study  staff in REDCap.  In addition  a paper or electronic copy  of the signed  and dated  consent  form  will be 
secured for participant level participants.  
 
Participants will be re -consented (including documentation of written consent) if they elect to participate in a different 
wave ot her than when the original consent was obtained.  
Initial  screen  (online  or by phone).  Participants  will provide  verbal  or electronic  consent  during  the initial  screen  
which  will be documented  in REDCap.  Information  provided  by the participants  will be used to assess  whether  or 
not they are eligible  for a screening appointment  (BL1).  Prior  to baseline  screening,  consent materials  and other  
study  related  information  will be sent to the study  participant  by post or e-mail.  
 
Baseline  screening.  Two screening  evaluations  will take place  remotely via UMN supported, HIPAA secure 
videoconference (i.e., Zoom) and/or phone  and will include  the following  consent  procedures.  
• First baseline  visit (BL1).  Participants will review consent materials on their own prior to  this visit.  
They will receive information about the  study purpose,  expectations  for participation,  risks  and 
benefits,  the voluntary  nature  of participation,  confidentiality  of information  provided,  research  related  
injury  etc. This information  will be reviewed  with potential  subjects  in a group  setting  or one-on-one. 
 
• Participants  will be asked  a series  of questions  (based  on the Modified Deaconess  Questionnaire)  to 
assess  their understanding  of the research (i.e. prior to and/or during the BL1 evaluation). Staff will 
review participant responses and invite  participants to ask questions  prior  to signing  the consent  form  at 
BL1. Participants will e -sign the consent form in REDCap directly. Participants who do not have the 
ability to e -sign the consent form in REDCap (e.g., they do not have an electronic device) will be 
mailed a paper consent form. They will be instructed to sign the paper consent form and mail it back in 
a postage paid envelope. Once consent is obtained, additional screening activities will occur.  
 
• Second  baseline  screening  (BL2) . Participants  will meet  with study  staff who will answer questions,  
provide  clarification  and reaffirm  consent  verbally.  Confirmation  of verbal consent  will be documented  
at BL2 in REDCap.  
 
Documentation: Signed  paper consent  forms  are secured  in a locked filing cabinet  at the Integrative  Health  
Wellbeing Research  Program  offices  at the University  of Minnesota. Electronic consent forms are captured & 
stored in REDCap. Those who consent electronically will not have a paper consent form.  
 
Revisions:  Changes  to the consent  form  may be initiated  by staff,  investigators, the DSMB  or the IRB because  
of the need  for clarification  or changes  to the protocols.  Changes  will be approved  by the  study  PI and  then 
submitted  to the IRB for approval.  
 
Page 31 V10 February 2021  
  Training  in Consent  Procedures.  In addition  to the required  institutional  training  in human subjects  protection,  
prior  to initiation  of participant  enrollment  (and annually  thereafter),  all study  staff will be required  to undergo  
project  specific  human  subjects  training  relevant  to their role and be certified  by the PI (or Co-I designee).  
Training  will include:  review  of the key elements  of the consent  form  including  potential  benefits,  risks  and 
alternatives  to study participation,  voluntary  nature  of participation,  confidentiality,  and disclosure  of new 
information  using  standardized  scripts.  Thes e will be reviewed  and applied  in practice  scenarios. As  part of the 
certification  process,  research  staff will be required  to participate  in mock scenarios  created  by the PI or 
designees  which  address  key elements  of consent, including e-consent.  Additional  details  are described  in the 
manual  of operations.  
 
4.3.5 Randomization  Procedures  
Eligible  participants  will be randomized  using  the web-based  Randomizing  Module  in REDCap.12 We 
will use two strata  for age (50-69 and 70+) and separate strata for sites . This will  includ e “online 
sites/groups ” for participants enrolled during specific time -intervals corresponding to treatment 
cohorts/classes after the transition to remote intervention delivery) . Block  randomization  will be used 
with random  sized  blocks,  varying  between  4 and 6, and a 1:1 allocation  ratio,  to ensure  group balance.  
Randomization  will occur  at the second,  screening  appointment  (BL2)  following  inclusion/exclusion  
criteria  confirmation (see 6.2.1 and 6.2.2).  
 
5. STUDY  INTERVENTIONS  
 
5.1 Interventions,  Administration,  and Duration  
We have  used intervention  mapping9,57,58  to align  evidence -based  behavioral  theories  and strategies  with project  
objectives  and stakeholder  needs  (at the participant,  facility  and organizational  levels).  
 
5.1.1 Administration  and Duration  
All intervention  sessions  will take place  remotely via HIPAA secure videoconference (i.e., Zoom) .  
 
The experimental  and control  interventions  will be 8, 90-minute,  remote  group  sessions  over 8 weeks  to meet  
the needs  of middle  to older  age participants.  This format  is consistent  with other YMCA  programs,  and will 
facilitate  long term sustainability.  
 
Both  experimental  and control  interventions  will include  the following  standard  elements : 
 
• An up to 90 minute orientation session prior to the start of the inter vention sessions (i.e. Week 0) to get 
oriented to the video -conference environment. This will include practicing using the video conferencing 
application and tips for setting up one’s space for an optimal experience. Trained study staff will also be 
available to assist participants in solving technical problems.   
• Narrated  videos  presenting  course  concepts  presented  by a content  expert.  Videos  will be 
interspersed  with group  discussions  led by a YMCA  staff facilitator  and intervention  specific  
activities  (see Section  5.1.2  and 5.1.3).  
• Standard  informational  materials  (web -based  and print workbook)  aimed  at increasing  knowledge  of 
national  physical  activity  guidelines  for older  adults1 as well as recommendations  for activities  to be 
done  at home,  in the community  and through  the YMCA.  This will include  short bouts  of exercise  
Page 32 V10 February 2021  
  frequently  throughout  the day, as well as suggestions  for a range  of indoor and  outdoor  options  
including  walking,  jogging,  dancing,  aerobic  exercise  classes,  and use of stationary  aerobic  machines  
appropriate  for different  fitness  levels. Additional information will include participation tips to ensure 
optimal learning, comfort and safety (see section 7.3).  
• Weekly reminder emails prior to each session  along with instructions on how to participate in the study 
remotely (e.g., Zoom instructions)  
 
5.1.2 Experimental  Intervention:  Mindful  Movement  
The Mindful  Movement  program  is adapted  from  the widely  used Mindfulness  Based  Stress Reduction  Program  
(MBSR)41, with which  the project  collaborators  have  considerable  experience.59-63 The program  will focus  on 
enhancing  individuals’  mindfulness  capabilities  and skills,  specifically  attention  regulation,  body  awareness,  
emotional  regulation,  and shifts  in self-perception,42 by providing  opportunities  for education,  practice,  and 
social  support  in mindfulness  practices  to facilitate  physical  activity  (see Figure  1 for Theoretical  Framework).  
The class  format  will include  the following  elements  in addition  to the standard  elements described  above:  
narrated  videos  of a trained  mindfulness  instructor  presenting  mindful  movement  related  course  concepts  and 
guided  meditations.  Videos  will be intersper sed with facilitator  led group  discussions  and mindful  movement  
exercises.  
 
Participants  will be introduced  to specific  content  including  mindfulness  practices  and meditation  techniques  
such as directed  breathing  and mindful  awareness  of thoughts  and sensations  during  sitting,  walking,  lying  
down  and other  postures,41,64  as well as other contemplative  (e.g. mindful)  physical  movements.  Evidence -
based  behavioral  strategies  will be incorporated  into the session  content  including  goal setting,  self-monitoring,  
social  support, relapse  management,  follow  up prompts,  and feedback.10,34  Support  resources  include  a 
workbook  to help set and monitor  achievable  goals  for daily  mindfulness  practices  and physical  activity  that 
builds  up to 300 minutes  (in 10 minute  bouts)  per week.  The narrated  videos (presented  in the class  sessions),  
as well as customized  mindful  movement  videos  and mindfulness  meditation  recordings  (ranging  from  5-20 
minutes  to accommodate  individual  participant  abilities  and preferences)  will be provided  on a webpage  to 
facilitate  practice.  Further details  regarding  delivery  of the Mindful  Movement  intervention  are provided  in the 
manual  of operations.  
 
5.1.3 Control  Intervention:  Keys to Health & Wellbeing  
We have adapted  an existing  education  program  “Keys to Health & Wellbeing  to Healthy  Aging” to  use as the 
comparison  intervention,  which  will be delivered  in a similar  manner  as the experimental  group  to control  for 
time and attention.  The Keys to Health & Wellbei ng program  is adapted  from  a community -based  educational  
program19 used previously  by members of  our team  as a comparison  group  for a mindfulness  intervention.63 The 
program  provides participants  useful  content  focused  on ways  to improve  overall  health.  We have changed  the 
name  of the program  to reflect  our community  partner’s  current  messaging  which  de-emphasizes focus  on age, 
and re-emphasizes  wellbeing  for all. Further,  we have  updated  the program  content  to include  recent  scientific  
evidence  and resources  that include  health  related  topics  requested  by older  adults  at the YMCA.  
 
The class  format  will include  the following  elements  in addition  to the standard  elements described  above:  
narrated  videos  by a content  expert  presenting  health  related -related information.  Videos  will be interspersed  
with YMCA  staff facilitator  led group  discussions  and workbook  exercises  focused  on things  participants  can 
do themselves  to improve  their overall  health  and wellbeing.  Participants  will be introduced  to general  health  
Page 33 V10 February 2021  
  content  including information  regarding  self-care tips for common  health  conditions  and maintaining  their 
social  and mental  health.  
 
Support  resources  include  a workbook  to help set and monitor  achievable  goals  for applying  the general  health  
practices  suggested  by the program.  The narrated  videos  (presented  in the class sessions),  as well as 
informational  links,  will be provided  on a webpage  to facilitate  application of  the information  presented.  
Further  details  regarding  delivery  of the Keys to Health & Wellbeing  intervention  are provided  in the manual  
of operations.  
 
5.1.4 Intervention  Training  
YMCA  staff will serve  as intervention  facilitators  for the group  interventions  sessions. Facilitators  will not be 
required  to be certified  in mindfulness  (e.g. MBSR)  or to have  significant  content  expertise  in the concepts  
related  to the interventions  (e.g. mindfulness  and overall  health and  wellbeing)  as this is not a reasonable  
expectation  for YMCA  staff.  YMCA  staff facilitators are  expected  to be trained  sufficiently  to understand  the 
content  to facilitate  intervention sessions  and to provide  participant  support in remote environments (e.g.  
videoconferencing).  This approach  has multiple  advantages.  First,  it will facilitate  consistency  and fidelity  
across  study  cohorts  and prevent  cross -contamination  (see section  5.2.2  below).  Secondly,  by refraining from  a 
program  that requires  extensive  training  and certification  of facilitators  (which  is what  is required  for MBSR  
instructor  certification),  there  is a greater  likelihood  that the intervention  can be adopted  and sustained  in 
YMCA  settings.  
 
The PI, her designees  and experienced  content  experts,  will train YMCA  staff to facilitate  the intervention  
sessions  to ensure  participant  safety  and methodological  rigor,  and enhance  long- term feasibility  and 
sustainability  at the YMCA.  Further  details  regarding  intervention  training are  provided  in the manual  of 
operations.  
 
Training  of YMCA  staff facilitators  will include:  
• Human  subjects  protection  and HIPAA  training  as required  by the University  of Minnesota  
• Study  specific  human  subjects  protection  training   
• Review  of rationale  for experimental  and control  interventions  and the importance  of maintaining  equipoise  
(note:  blinding  of facilitators  is not possible)  
• Facilitation  of interventions  including  review  of key concepts  and practices,  and practical  application  
through  mock  scenarios   
 
5.2 Handling  of Study  Interventions  
5.2.1 Accountability  Records  
For each session,  facilitators  will complete  the intervention  administration  form  in REDCap.  The form  
documents  participant  attendance,  adverse events, and includes  a checklist  of the elements  covered  in sessions  
(see Section  6.2.4)  and any reasons  for facilitators  deviating  from  protocol.  This will be reviewed  by study staff  
and presented  in a summary  format  to the investigators for review on a routine basis.  
 
5.2.2 Intervention  Fidelity  
Intervention  fidelity  will be assessed  by the PI’s designees using  fidelity  instruments  that address  whether  or not 
Page 34 V10 February 2021  
  content  elements  of intervention  sessions were  addressed,  facilitator  enthusiasm  and other  factors  that could  
affect  outcomes.  At least 15% of  the sessions  will be assessed  for fidelity.  We will use adapted  fidelity 
instruments  used in previous  studies.  Fidelity  of intervention  delivery  will also be assessed  by review  of session  
checklists  completed  by the facilitators.  Fidelity  procedures  and instruments are  further  described  in the manual  
of operations.  
 
5.2.3 Intervention  Logistics  (Group  Size,  Cohort  Management)  
We anticipate  the minimum  class  size will be 8 persons  and the maximum  will be 16 (which  approximates  
existing  YMCA  and other  mindfulness  programs). However, classes may proceed with less than 8, or more 
than 16 persons. The PI will make the final determination as to whether or not a smaller or larger class is 
appropriate.  
 
5.3 Concomitant  Interventions  
5.3.1 Allowed  Interventions  
Participants  are allowed  and encouraged  to take part in physical  activity  and other  interventions as  they 
normally  would,  that are necessary  for managing  their health.  
 
5.3.2 Prohibited  Interventions  
Participants  will be excluded  from  participating  in the study  if at the time of enrollment,  they are participating  
or plan to participate  over the 8-week  intervention  period  in the following:  formal  educational  programs  similar  
in terms  of content  (e.g. mindfulness  based,  general  health),  format  (e.g. group  sessions,  facilitator  led), and 
length  of delivery  (1.5 hours  per week  x 4-8 weeks)  to the  experimental  and control  interventions  offered  in the 
study.  
 
5.4 Adherence  Assessment  
Adherence  to the intervention  regimen  is defined as follows:  
• >70% of enrolled  participants  adhere  to the interventions  (defined  as attending  6/8 sessions,  as measured  
by the YMCA  staff facilitator  and entered  on the intervention  administration  form).  
• >70% of enrolled  participants  report  participation  in assigned  intervention -specific  ‘home  practices’  >3 
days per week  (as measured  on the post-intervention  W9 self-report  questionnaire)  
• >80% of enrolled  participants  satisfied  with experimental  and control  interventions  (as measured  on 
the post-intervention  W9 self-report  questionnaire)

  6.2 Description  of Evaluations  
Table  1 summarizes  the screening  and follow  up evaluations  (participant -level  subjects).   
 
6.2.1 Screening  Evaluation  
 
During the screening process and prior to additional study visits post enrollment (if applicable), 
participants will be given instructions on how to participate in the study remotely. These instructions 
will include instruction sheets and tutorial videos for how to use videoconferencing applications. These 
will be sent via email, mail and/or reviewed during screening evaluations.  
 
Initial  Screen . Potential  participants  will be initially  screened  for eligibility  using  direct  electronic  data 
entry  in REDCap  administered  to the participant  through  a web-based  survey interface  or a phone  
screen  with trained  study  staff.  Both  processes  will include  an introduction to  the study  and participants  
will be required  to provide  verbal  or electronic  informed  consent  (see 4.3.4).  Participants  will be asked  
questions  pertaining  to inclusion/exclusion  criteria : age, self-reported  physical  activity  levels,  
pregnancy,  medical  restrictions  to increasing  physical  activity,  contraindications  to mindfulness  
practices  (serious  mental  health  condition,  suicidality, substance  abuse,  PTSD  and seizure  disorders),  
and terminal  illness.  To assess which participants will need devices/equipment to participate, we will ask 
about electronic technology, internet access and technology related capabilities and needs. Eligible  
individuals  will be scheduled  for a first baseline  evaluation.  They  will be asked  to let study  staff know 
prior  to their BL1 visit if there  are changes  to their health  status  that may affect  their eligibility. The  
manual  of operations  describes  circumstances  and procedures  for additional screening.  
 
BL1 (first  baseline  evaluation) . The first baseline  evaluation  will take place  up to 90 days after  the 
initial  screen  described  above.  This evaluation will be conducted via Zoom and/or telephone.  
• Trained  study  staff will perform  informed  consent  (see Consent  Procedures)  
• The Folstein  Mini -Mental  Status  Examination (MMSE) will be administered to participants if 
cognitive impairment is suspected (e.g., repeating questions, unable to respond to/follow basic 
instructions)   
• Inclusion/exclusion  criteria  will be confi rmed  using  eligibility  checklists directly  entered  in 
REDCap  by study  staff.   
• Self-report  questionnaires  will provide  baseline  assessment  of demographic  and health  
characteristics  along  with self-reported  outcome  questionnaires  (SRQs, see Section  9.5).  
• Study  staff will collect  anthropometric  measurements by participant self -report; waist size will 
also be captured to fit  individuals  with an accelerometer, which is  required  for the baseline  
objective  outcome  measurement  of physical  activity.  
• Participants eligible for BL2 will be mailed accelerometer with wear and return mailing 
instructions (a pre -paid postage return envelope will be provided).  
 
 
BL2 (second  baseline  evaluation) . A second  baseline  evaluation  will take place  7-28 business days 
after BL1.  This evaluation will be conducted via video/teleconference. Study staff will  
• Confirm consent and eligibility criteria  
• Administer BL2 participant survey if not completed prior to BL2  
• Inclusion/exclusion  criteria  will be confirmed  using  eligibility  checklists  completed  by study 
Page 37 V10 February 2021  
  staff via direct  electronic  entry  into REDCap.   
• Final eligibility determination  will occur  following  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  confirmation 
(see sections 4.3.5 and 6.2.2).  
 
6.2.2 Enrollment,  Baseline,  and Randomization  
Enrollment . Enrollment  is defined  as occurring  at the date of randomization  at which  point  all of the  
screening  criteria  are met and the individual  has agreed  to participate.  
 
Baseline  Assessments . The following  baseline  assessments  will be performed  prior  to randomization  
and are summarized  in Table  1. 
 
Self-report  questionnaires  (SRQs ) will be used to collect  the following  baseline  variables.  These  are 
distributed  between  BL1 and BL2 (see Table  1) to reduce  burden  on participants.  
o Baseline  demographics.  Participants  will report  ethnicity,  race,  employment  status, marital  
status,  education,  YMCA  membership  status,  household  income,  use of ambulatory  devices  
(e.g. cane),  experience  with study  interventions,  YMCA  membership status  on the self-report  
questionnaire.  
o Anthropometrics. Height and weight collected via participant self -report  
o Baseline  health  characteristics  including  current  health  conditions  and smoking  history  on the  
self-report  questionnaire.  
o Baseline  SRQ  outcome  measures  of quality  of life, exercise  self-efficacy  and expectations , 
mindfulness , wellbeing , bodily  pain, physical  activity , social  connectedness  and assurance , 
COVID -19 impact, interoceptive awareness , and intervention  satisfaction  (see Section  9.5 for 
description  of these  outcome  measures). Accelerometers  will be used to collect  objective  physical  
activity  outcomes  (see 9.5);  accelerometers  will be mailed to qualified participants following the first 
baseline appointment. Participants will mail the devices back in postage -provided envelopes.  
 
Randomization.  Prior  to study  enrollment,  the study’s  statistician  will assign  a member  of his staff  to 
create  the random  allocation  tables  according  to the allocation  plan (see Section 9.2),  which  will be 
administered  using  the randomization  module  in REDCap.  Randomization will  occur  at BL2 after 
completion  of all screening  and baseline  evaluations, and inclusion and exclusion criteria are verified 
(see Sections 4.3.5, 6.2.1 and 6.2.2).  As each participant  becomes  eligible,  project  staff responsible  for 
enrolling  participants  will access  REDCap  to obtain  the electronically  generated  rando m assignment  for 
that participant.  All study  personnel  will be blinded  to upcoming  assignments.  Enrolled  individuals  will 
commence  their allocated intervention  up to 14 business  days post randomization.  
 
6.2.3 Blinding  
Blinded  Personnel:  The PI, select co-investigators,  and the study  statistician  will be blinded  until the 
database  is locked.  The study’s  statistician  will assign  a member  of his staff to create  the random  
allocation  tables  according  to the allocation  plan,  which  will be administered  using  the randomization  
module  in REDCap.   
 
Unblinded  Personnel : The Project  Director  and Coordinator,  YMCA  staff facilitators, and data 
manager  will not be blinded  to study  interventions.  The Project  Director  and Coordinator  facilitate  
Page 38 V10 February 2021  
  scheduling and  tracking  of participants  to ensure  timely  participation  in intervention  and other  study 
activities.  The YMCA  staff facilitators  conduct  the remote  intervention  sessions.  Unblinded personnel  
will not participate  in data preparation  or analyses.  
 
Individuals  authorized  to break  the blind:  The PIs and their investigator  designees  are authorized  to 
break  the blind.    
 
Circumstances  for breaking  the blind : This will occur  when  it is in the participants’  safety - related  
interest.  The primary  example  is a reportable  adverse  event.

6.2.6 Additional  Evaluation  Related  to Hybrid  Effectiveness/Implementation  Design  and 
RE-AIM  and PRECIS  Frameworks  
The incorporation  of the hybrid  effectiveness -implementation  designs  and RE-AIM  framework,18,55  
necessitate  additional  data collection,  which  is described  below.  
 
• As part  of Aim 3, we will gather  contextual  information  using  qualitative  methods  (via open -
ended  surveys,  interviews  and field notes)  related  to barriers and  facilitators,  intervention  
satisfaction  (at participant  and facility  levels),  protocol  confidence  (facility  level),  and 
intervention  relevance,  practicality,  and affordability (organizational  levels). These  data will be 
used to inform  interpretation  of results regarding  the Mindful  Movement  program’s  
effectiveness  and creation  of a web-based toolkit  (including  Manuals  of Operations,  staff 
training  materials,  participants’ informational  materials,  etc.) to facilitate  dissemination  of 
program  to other  sites.  
 
7. SAFETY  ASSESSMENTS  
 
7.1 Expected  adverse  events  by intervention  
The inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  and adverse  monitoring  procedures,  have  been  developed  to 
minimize  the risk of adverse  events.  
 
Mindful  Movement  Program.  The probability  of risks  occurring  as a result  of mindfulness based  
interventions  is considered  very low. There  is a very small  chance  of the following  adverse  events  
occurring:  
• Aggravation  of PTSD  symptoms  associated  with mindfulness  and meditation  practices  
• Aggravation  of mental  health  symptoms  associated  with mindfulness  and meditation 
practices  
• Cardiac  events  associated  with increasing  physical  activity  
• Minor  physical  discomfort  associated  with mindfulness  and meditation  practice  
positions  and postures  
• Seizures  associated  with mindfulness  and meditation  practices  
• Short -lasting  muscle  and joint soreness  associated  with recommended  physical  activity  
• Social  anxiety  associated  with participating  in group  sessions  
 
Keys to Health & Wellbeing  Program.  The probability  of risks  occurring  as a result  of general  
education  programs  is considered  very low. There  is a possibility  of the following adverse  events  
occurring:  
• Cardiac  events  associated  with increasing  physical  activity  
• Short -lasting  muscle  and joint soreness  associated  with engagement  in recommended 
physical  activity  
Page 40 V10 February 2021  
  • Social  anxiety  associated  with participating  in group  sessions  
 
7.2  Specification  of Safety  Parameters  
Safety  of participants  will be addressed  in the eligibility  screening  that identifies  persons  that have  
contraindications  to the interventions  and increasing  physical  activity.  Once  enrolled, participants  will 
be queried  regarding  the occurrence  of adverse  events  (active  surveillance)  and reminded  to report  
them  to study  staff should  they occur  (passive  surveillance).  
 
 
7.3 Methods  and Timing  for Assessing,  Recording,  and Analyzing  Safety Parameters  
Our methods  and timing  for assessing  recording  and analyzing  safety  parameters  are described below.  
Mindfulness  based  interventions  are generally  presumed  to be associated  with minimal  adverse  events.  
However,  similar  to other  fields,  systematic  adverse  event  reporting  has been inadequate  and the 
presumption  of safety  is not well informed  by rigorous  scientific  evidence.65 This is confirmed  by recent  
systematic  reviews  of mindfulness  based  interventions  noting  a lack of  studies  in which  systematic  
assessment  of adverse  events  occurred.66,67  Most  mindfulness based  intervention  related  adverse  events  
are associated  with meditation.  There  have  been  case reports  and observational  studies  of mental  health  
related  symptoms  including  anxiety,  panic, traumatic  memory  re-experiencing,  and others.65 
Given  the lack of rigorous  evidence  regarding  mindfulness  based  intervention  related  adverse  events,  
and to ensure  participant  safety,  we have  designed  our inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  to protect  
individuals  in which  mindfulness  based  interventions  are considered  contraindicated  (e.g. 
active  PTSD,  suicidality,  severe  mental  health  disorders;  see Section  4.2). This is based  on 
recommendations  from  The University  of Massachusetts  Center  for Mindfulness64 and our project’s  
expert  consultants.  We will also train staff to be aware  of signs  of potential  distress,  and how  to address  
(this is detailed  in the manual  of operations).  Further,  we will use active  adverse event  surveillance  
methods  in addition  to passive  surveillance  (see Section  7.4). 
 
In addition we will provide:  
 
• Explicit instructions at multiple points to participants regarding what they should do if they don’t 
feel comfortable sharing in the group. This includes reviewing with participants:  
o It is important to take care of themselves and monitor how much information, if an y, they 
are comfortable sharing;   
o It is fine to leave the session environment as needed;   
o It is okay to opt out or pass on any session activities, including discussions. This can be 
done by sending a private message to the facilitators within session or sa ying “pass” if 
called upon.   
 
These instructions are provided throughout the program:  
o In writing, in the workbook, which participants review with facilitators at the first session, 
and then are encouraged to read and use each week.  
o Verbally, by session facilitators, at the beginning of each session (as detailed in the 
manual of operations).  
o Verbally, by session facilitators, prior to any group discussions within the sessions (as 
detailed in the manual of operations).   
 
Page 41 V10 February 2021  
  In addition, participants a re routinely encouraged to let the study team know if they have any 
concerns or hesitations about participating in the sessions. This includes:  
 
o Each week enrolled participants are sent a reminder email about their upcoming 
intervention session. The study team will include a note encouraging participants to 
contact the PI/study team (i.e., respond to the email or call the study number (included in 
the email)) if they have any concerns about the upcoming session. All participant emails 
are acknowledged by a member of the study team and responded to accordingly. If a 
participant indicates they feel uncomfortable participating in group discussions, the 
session facilitator will be informed and the participant will not be called upon.   
 
 
7.4 Adverse  Events  and Seriou s Adverse  Events  
Prior  to initiation  of research  activities,  all project  personnel  engaged  in human  subject  research will  be 
required  to complete  CITI  Program  training  in HSR  and every  3 years  thereafter.  In addition,  all project  
personnel  will receive  training  in the application  of HSR  principles  as they directly  apply  to the project.  
These  will be delivered  via live sessions  conducted  by the PI, designated  Co-Is, and Project  Director.  
They  will be conducted  prior  to commencing  related  activities,  and at routine  intervals  through  the life 
of the project  (no less than annually).  Content  will focus  on human  subjects  related  study  protocols  and 
procedures.  
 
YMCA  staff,  will not be involved  in assessing,  evaluating  and reporting,  adverse  events  (AEs). Instead,  
participating  subjects  will be instructed  to contact  the PI and/or the  Project  Director (or designee) with 
information about their event.  The PI and/or the  Project  Director (or designee), will contact the DSMB 
Safety Officer, who will adjudicate the event using a standardized form in REDCap. The PI and/or the  
Project  Director (or designee) may assist with adjudication. Additionally,  YMCA  staff made  aware  of 
AEs will be trained  to notify  the PI and Project  Director  in a timely  manner  using  standardized study  
forms.  
 
7.4.1 Definitions  
Adverse  Event.  An adverse  event  (AE)  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a subject  during 
participation  in the clinical  study  or with use of the experimental  agent  being  studied.  An adverse  
finding  can include  a sign,  symptom,  abnormal  assessment  (laboratory  test value,  vital signs, 
electrocardiogram  finding,  etc.),  or any combination  of these  regardless  of relationship  to participation  
in the study.  
 
Unanticipated  Problems.  The Office  for Human  Research  Protections  (OHRP)  considers 
unanticipated  problems  involving  risks  to subjects  or others  to include,  in general,  any incident, 
experience,  or outcome  that meets  all of the following  criteria:  
• Unexpected  in terms  of nature,  severity,  or frequency  given  (a) the research  procedures that  
are described  in the protocol -related  documents,  such as the IRB-approved  research protocol  
and informed  consent  document;  and (b) the characteristics  of the subject  population  being  
studied;  
• Related  or possibly  related  to participation  in the research  (“possibly  related”  means there  is a 
reasonable  possibility  that the incident,  experience,  or outcome  may have  been caused  by the 
procedures  involved  in the research);  and 
Page 42 V10 February 2021  
  • Suggests  that the research  places  subjects  or others  at a greater  risk of harm  (including 
physical,  psychological,  economic,  or social  harm)  than was previously  known  or recognized.  
 
Serious  Adverse  Events.  A serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  is one that meets  one or more  of the 
following  criteria:  
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening  (places  the subject  at immediate  risk of death  from  the event  as it 
occurred)  
• Results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
• Results  in a persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  
• Results  in a congenital  anomaly  or birth  defect  
 
7.4.2 Time  Period  and Frequency  
Collection  and Time  Period.  Unanticipated  problems  will be recorded  in the data collection system  
throughout  the study.  The PI, or designee,  will record  all reportable  events  with start dates  occurring  any 
time after randomization  until 7 (for non-serious  AEs)  or 30 days  (for SAEs)  after the last day of study  
participation.  At each study  visit or data collection time point,  the investigator,  or designee,  will inquire  
about  the occurrence  of AE/SAEs  since  the last visit/questionnaire.  Study related AE/SAEs will be 
followed to stabilization/resolution post end of study participation.  
 
7.4.3 Characteristics  of an Adverse  Event  
 
Relationship  to Study  Intervention.  To assess  relationship  of an event  to study  intervention, the  
following  guidelines  are used:  
• Related  (Possible,  Probable,  Definite)  
• The event  is known  to occur  with the study  intervention.  
• There  is a temporal  relationship  between  the intervention  and event  onset.  
• The event  abates  when  the intervention  is discontinued.  
• The event  reappears  upon  a re-challenge  with the intervention.  
• Not Related  (Unlikely,  Unrelated)  
• There  is no temporal  relationship  between  the intervention  and event  onset.  
• An alternate  etiology  has been  established.  
 
Expectedness.  The Safety Officer,  will be responsible  for determining whether  an SAE  is expected  or 
unexpected.  The PI and/or designee may assist with determination, as needed.  An adverse  event  will be 
considered  unexpected  if the  nature,  severity,  or frequency  of the event  is not consistent  with the risk 
information previously  described  for the intervention  in the consent  form.  
 
Severity  of Event.  The following  scale  will be used to grade  adverse  events:  
• Mild:  transient  or minimal  symptoms;  no change  in activity  level;  no therapy  or only 
symptomatic  therapy  required.  
Page 43 V10 February 2021  
  • Moderate:  symptomatic;  moderate  change  in activity  level;  minimal  decrease  in social  
activities;  specific  therapy  required.  
• Severe:  incapacitating  = ≥ 24 hours  of any of the following:  loss of work,  bed rest, 
decreased  social  activities.  
• Serious:  results  in death;  life threatening;  requires  inpatient  hospitalization;  results  in 
persistent  or significant  disability;  congenital  anomaly  or birth defect.  
 
7.5 Reporting  Procedures  
7.5.1 Unanticipated  Problem  Reporting  
Incidents  or events  that meet  the OHRP  criteria  for unanticipated  problems  require  the creation and  
completion  of an unanticipated  problem  report  form.  OHRP  recommends  that investigators include  the 
following  information  when  reporting  an adverse  event,  or any other  incident, experience,  or outcome  
as an unanticipated  problem  to the IRB:  
• Appropriate  identifying  information  for the research  protocol,  such as the title, 
investigator’s  name,  and the IRB project  number;  
• A detailed  description  of the adverse  event,  incident,  experience,  or outcome;  
• An explanation  of the basis  for determining  that the adverse  event,  incident,  experience, or  
outcome  represents  an unanticipated  problem;  
• A description  of any changes  to the protocol  or other  corrective  actions  that have  been taken  
or are proposed  in response  to the unanticipated  problem.  
 
To satisfy  the requirement  for prompt  reporting,  unanticipated  problems  will be reported  using the  
following  timeline:  
• Unanticipated  problems  that are serious  adverse  events  will be reported  to the IRB,  
Independent  Safety  Monitor(s),  and NCCIH  within  7 days of the investigator  becoming aware  
of the event.  
• Any other  unanticipated  problem  will be reported  to the IRB,  Independent  Safety 
Monitor(s),  and NCCIH  within  14 days of the investigator  becoming  aware  of the problem.  
• All unanticipated  problems  should  be reported  to appropriate  institutional  officials  (as 
required  by an institution’s  written  reporting  procedures),  the supporting  agency  head (or  
designee),  and OHRP  within  one month  of the IRB’s  receipt  of the report  of the problem  
from  the investigator.  
Page 44 V10 February 2021  
  7.5.2 Adverse  Event  Reporting  of Non-IND Studies  
SAEs  that are unanticipated,  serious,  and possibly  related  to the study  intervention  will be reported  to 
the DSMB,  IRB,  and NCCIH  in accordance  with requirements.  
• Unexpected  fatal or life-threatening  AEs related  to the intervention  will be reported  to the  
NCCIH  Program  Officer,  and Independent  Safety  Monitor(s)  within  3 days of the 
investigator  becoming  aware  of the event.  Other  serious  and unexpected  AEs related  to the  
intervention  will be reported  within  7 days.  
• Anticipated  or unrelated  SAEs  will be handled  in a less urgent  manner  but will be reported  
to the Independent  Safety  Monitor(s),  IRB,  and other  oversight  organizations  in accordance  
with their requirements  and will be reported  to NCCIH  on an annual  basis.  
• All other  AEs documented  during  the course  of the trial will be reported  to NCCIH  on an  
annual  basis  by way of inclusion  in the annual  report  and in the annual  AE summary which  
will be provided  to NCCIH  and to the Independent  Monitors.  The Independent  Safety  
Monitor(s)  Report  will state that all AEs have  been  reviewed.  
 
7.5.3 Reporting  of Pregnancy  
It is unlikely,  but possible,  given  the age range  of study  participants  that pregnancy  may occur. 
Participants  will be queried  prior  to enrolling  regarding  pregnancy  status,  and assessed  for the 
study’s  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.  Medical  restrictions  (of any type)  for increasing  physical  
activity  are exclusionary  for all participants.  
 
 
7.6 Safety  Monitoring  
A Data  Safety  and Monitoring  Board  has been  assigned  to perform  independent  study 
monitoring.  
Page 45 V10 February 2021  
  8. INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  
 
8.1 Investigator  Initiated  Discontinuation  
If a participant  experiences  a change  in their health  status  so they no longer  meet  the inclusion and  
exclusion  criteria,  or if new information  arises  suggesting  the research  is unsafe  for them  to participate  
in the intervention,  the PI will withdraw  them  from  the research  without  their consent. It  is noted  that 
that this occurrence  is unlikely,  given  the interventions  in this study  are considered to  be low risk. 
Participants  will continue  to be followed  up for outcomes  with their permission. In  the event  that the 
participant’s  change  in health  status  is temporary  and they are able and willing  to resume  participation  
in the intervention,  the participant  will be administered relevant  questions  from  the screening  
evaluations;  if the participant  meets  the inclusion  criteria, they  will be allowed  to continue  with the 
intervention.  
 
8.2 Participant  Initiated  Discontinuation  
Participants  will be asked  to submit  in writing  to the PI (e.g. signed  and dated letter or email)  if they 
want  to withdraw  from  the study.  For reporting  purposes,  research  staff will inquire  about  reasons  for 
their withdrawal.  Participants  will also be asked  if they’re  willing  to complete  self-report  
questionnaires,  and participate  in objective  data collection  (e.g.,  accelerometer)  as a means  of 
collecting  primary  and secondary  outcomes.  If they refuse,  participants  will not be contacted  by the  
study  team.  A formal  letter  will be sent by the PI, or designee,  indicating  receipt  of their request  for 
withdrawal  and additional  provisions  around  data collection,  if applicable.  The letter will  reiterate  our 
appreciation  for their participation  to date and remind  participants  that their withdrawal  will not affect  
their relationship  with the university  or the YMCA.  Regulatory bodies  will be provided  summary  
information  related  to attrition  (e.g.,  losses  to follow -up, withdrawal s etc.).  Participants  will not be 
named.  
 
9. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 General  Design  Issues  
The reliability  and validity  of primary  and secondary  outcome  measures  are described  in Section  
9.5.2  below.  
 
9.1.1 Hypotheses  
 
Our primary  hypothesis  is that there  will be a significant  advantage  (>56 minutes)  in terms  of the 
primary  outcome  measure,  weekly  minutes  spent  in >10 minute  bouts  of MVPA  for Mindful  
Movement  over the Keys to Health & Wellbeing.  
 
Our secondary  hypotheses  are: 
• There  will be significant  advantages  of Mindful  Movement  over Keys to Health & Wellbeing  
in terms  of the secondary  objective  outcome  measures  of time spent  per week in  ≥ 10 minute  
bouts  of MVPA;  time spent  per week  in MVPA  and sedentary  activity;  and steps  per day 
• There  will be significant  advantages  of Mindful  Movement  over Keys to Health & Wellbeing  
in terms  of the secondary  self-reported  outcomes:  quality  of life, exercise self-efficacy  and 
expectations,  mindfulness,  wellbeing,  bodily  pain and physical  activity  
Page 46 V10 February 2021  
  • There  will be no significant  advantages  of Mindful  Movement  over Keys to Health & 
Wellbeing  in terms  of the secondary  self-reported  outcomes  of social  connectedness  and 
assurance,  and intervention  satisfaction.  
 
9.2 Sample  Size and Randomization  
9.2.1  Sample  Size 
The sample  size is calculated based  on the primary  outcome  of change  in minutes/week  spent  in ≥10-min 
bouts  of MVPA between  baseline  and post-intervention  (9 weeks) . In the R21 pilot study, we observed a 
standard deviation of 57 min for ≥10 -min bouts  of MVPA at week 9. This is lower than what we 
originally anticipated from the existing literature (120 min) 73 37 which provided the best available estimate at 
the time the original proposal was written. These studies however are not ideal representations of the 
interventions and population for the proposed study. Recognizing the standard deviation estimate from the 
pilot study is based on a limited number of participants (n=29), we performed 5000 bootstrap 
replications  of our pilot sample and used the upper end of the distribution as a conservative variability 
estimate. This yielded a standard deviation estimate of 85 minutes, which when used as an estimate at 
baseline and week 9 will allow for detection  of a medium eff ect size (0.50) difference between groups, of 
approximately 40 minutes in 182 participants (assuming alpha = 0.05, power = 0.85 , correlation (ρ) 
between baseline and week 9 measures of 0.54,  10% loss to follow up; STATA, StataCorp. 2015 Stata 
Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Varying the strength of correlation 
between the baseline and week 9 measures changes the detectable differences between groups from 3 1 
(ρ = 0.7) to 47 minutes (ρ = 0.3). Data from the R21 pilot study (ρ = 0.54) was used to estimate the 
correlation between baseline and week 9 MVPA measures.  
 
9.2.2  Randomization/Treatment  Assignment  Procedures  
Eligible  individuals  will be randomized  using  the web-based  Randomizing  Module  in REDCap by  
trained  study  staff masked  to upcoming  treatment  assignments.  Randomization will be stratified by site  
(including a  “online site s/groups ” for participants enrolled during specific time -intervals corresponding 
to treatment cohorts/classes after the transition to remote intervention delivery)  and age (50-69 and 
70+).  Block  randomization  will be used with random  sized  blocks,  varying  between  4 and  6, and a 1:1 
allocatio n ratio,  to ensure  group  balance.  The study’s  statistician  will assign  a member  of his staff to 
create  the random  allocation  tables  according  to the allocation plan,  which  will be administered  using  
the randomization  module  in REDCap.  Investigators  will be blinded  to individual  participants’  group  
assignment  until after the analysis  by the study statistician  is complete.  Breaking  the blind  will occur  if, 
in the event  of a serious  adverse  event, expected  or unexpected,  it is necessary  to protect  patient  safety  
and/or  determine  the relatedness of  the event  to the intervention.  In these  instances,  the Project  Director  
(who  must  remain  un- blinded  to coordinate  individuals’  participation)  will provide  the PI or designee  
the individual’s specific  intervention  assignment.  The breaking  of the blind  will be documented  by the 
Project  Director,  and will be reported  to all monitoring  bodies  as required.  
 
9.3 Definition  of Populations  
All analyses  will be conducted  using  the intention  to treat principle.  That is, all participants  will be 
analyzed  in the group  to which  they were  randomized  regardless  of outside  care,  adherence  to 
protocols,  or compliance  with follow -up.

  problem,  unable  to perform/extreme  problem).  The advantage  of the EQ5D over  other  
instruments  is its brevity  and ease of use. 
• Exercise  self-efficacy  will be measured  using  the Self-Efficacy  for Exercise  (SEE)  scale88 a 
reliable  and valid  measure  of exercise  self-efficacy  tested  in older  adult  populations. 
Individuals  are asked  to rate their confidence  in their ability  to exercise  in each of nine 
situations.  Confidence  ratings  range  from  0 (not confident)  to 10 (very  confident).  
• Exercise  expectations  will be measured  using  the Outcome  Expectations  for Exercise -2 
(OEE -2), a 13-item instrument  focused  on beliefs  about  the positive  and negative  physical  
and mental  health  benefits  of exercise.88 Responses  range  from  1 (strongly  agree)  to 5 
(strongly  disagree).  The OEE -2 has been  shown  to be reliable  and valid  in older 
individuals.88 
• Dispositional  mindfulness  will be measured  with the Mindful  Attention  Awareness  Scale  
(MAAS),  which  has demonstrated  good  internal  consistency,  reliability,  construct  validity, 
and responsiveness.89,90  The scale  is comprised  of 15 items  measured  on a 6-point  scale  
(1=almost  always,  6=almost  never)  which  when  combined  represents  a single  construct  of 
dispositional  mindfulness.  
• State  mindfulness  will be measured  using  the Frieberg  Mindfulness  Inventory  (FMI)  to 
assess  mindfulness  skill.91,92  The FMI addresses  14 items  with a four-point  response  scale 
(1=rarely,  4=almost  always),  and has been  found  to have  good  internal  consistency  and 
convergent  validity.92 
• Wellbeing  will be measured  using  the brief  8-item Flourishing  Scale93 assessing  perceived 
success  in relationships,  self-esteem,  purpose,  etc. It is psychometrically  sound  and provides a  
single  psychological  wellbeing  score.  
• Bodily  pain (including  musculoskeletal  pain)  is a common  occurrence  with aging32,94  and may  
affect  engagement  in physical  activity.95,96  Participants  will be asked  to rate their pain in the  
past 7 days in four bodily  areas  (legs including  foot,  ankle,  knee  and hip; arm including hand,  
wrist,  elbow  and shoulder;  back  including  neck,  mid and low back;  and other)  on an 11 -box 
numerical  rating  scale  (0=no  pain,  10=the  worst  pain possible).  97 
• Physical  activity  (self-reported)  will be measured  using  questions  adapted  from  the 
International  Physical  Activity  Questionnaire  (IPAQ)  which  has been tested  for reliability and  
validity,  and used in older  populations.98 The IPAQ  is a nine- item instrument  addressing 
days/week  and minutes/day  spent  on physical  activity  in the past 7 days.  While  physical  
activity  self-report  measures  tend to provide  over-estimates,79 we will explore  the extent  to 
which  this is true for the population.  Self-report  methods  are less burdensome  and costly,  and 
would  be better  suited  for routine  evaluations  in the long-term.  
• Social  connectedness  and social  assurance  will be measured  using  two 8-item questionnaires, 
and a six item scale  (strongly  agree,  strongly  disagree).99 
• Interoceptive Awareness will be measured using the Multidimensional Assessment of 
Interoceptive Awareness survey instrument (V2). 111 To reduce participant burden, we will 
limit measurement to four subscales which focus on domains covered in our mindfulness 
intervention: noticing (which includes awareness of uncomfortable, comfortable, and neutral 
body sensations); attention regulation (including the ability to sustain and control attention to 
body sensations); emotional awareness (including awareness of the connection between body 
sensations and emotional states); and self -regulation (including ability to regulate distress by 
attention to body sensations).  
Page 49 V10 February 2021  
   
• Intervention  satisfaction  will be collected  using  a question  that has participant’s  rate their 
overall  satisfaction  ranging  from  completely  satisfied  to completely  dissatisfied.  
• Adherence  to home  practice  will be collected  using  a question  that asks the average  number 
of days per week  that participants  completed  the recommended  home  practices.  
• Adverse  events  will be collected  through  both active  and passive  surveillance.  For active  
surveillance,  participants  will be asked  to report  side effects  by choosing  from  a list 
generated  from  previous  studies  including  exercise  and older  adults81,100,101and known 
potential  risks  of mindfulness  interventions.64 Participants  will rate the bothersomeness  of 
these  adverse  events  on an 11-box scale  (0=not  at all bothersome,  10=extremely 
bothersome).  For passive  surveillance,  participants  will be instructed  to contact  the PI or 
Project  Director  (see Section  7). 
• COVID -19 Impact and Zoom : Covid -19 impact may be asked at baseline. Enrolled 
participants may be queried following the intervention phase and at long -term follow -up 
data collection points (e.g., W26 and W52, per the study protocol). Future enrolled 
participants/cohorts may not be impacted, and thus the following questions will not be 
relevant. The PI and study team, with the study funder (NCCIH), will determine which 
cohorts of participants are affected by the COVID -19 pandemic and which participants will 
participate in the intervention remotely via Zoom; these individuals will be asked to 
answer  questions related to pandemic impact on physical activity (5 -item Likert scale), 
satisfaction with Zoom (7 -point Likert scale) and advantages/disadvantages of Zoom using 
open -ended questions.   
• Working Alliance Inventory (WAI): We wi ll measure participants’ views of the working 
alliance with facilitators using an adaptation of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) 
Short Form C .113The WAI is composed of three subscales —bond, task, and goal —which 
are important aspects of the therapeutic alliance.   
• Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ): Participants’ views of the remote intervention 
delivery platform will be assessed using items adapted from the Telehealth Usability 
Questionnaire .112  To reduce burden, we will limit measurement to items  related to the 
perceived usefulness, ease of use, learnability, interface quality, interaction quality, and 
reliability of the remote delivery platform.  
 
For Aim 3: we will collect  participation flow data (e.g.  enrollment, participation, session attendance, follow 
up rates, etc.) and qualitative  data (using  qualitative  surveys  and field notes)  to gather  the necessary  
contextual  information  related  to barriers  and facilitators,  intervention  satisfaction  (at participant  and 
facility  levels),  protocol  confidence  (facility  level),  and intervention  relevance,  practicality,  and 
affordability  (organizational  levels).  
 
9.6 Data  Analyses  
Outcomes  data will be analyzed  by a statistician  masked  to study  group  assignment.  
For Aim 1 to determine  the relative  effectiveness  of Mindful  Movement  versus  Keys to Health & 
Wellbeing  in a Randomized  Controlled  Trial  (RCT,  n=182)  we will conduct  the following  analyses.  
 
For the primary  physical  activity  outcome : time spent  per week  in ≥ 10 minute  bouts  of moderate  
vigorous  physical  activity  (MVPA)  at 9 weeks;  
Page 50 V10 February 2021  
  • An intention -to- treat analysis  will be used including  all participants  with at least one 
outcome  measurement  in the analysis.  
• A mixed -model  regression  will be used for the primary  outcome  measure.  The primary  
analysis  will evaluate  change  in weekly  minutes  spent  in 10-min bouts  of MVPA using  
mixed  model  longitudinal  regression  (PROC  MIXED  in SAS)  version  9.3 (SAS Institute,  
Cary,  North  Carolina).  The analysis,  using  the baseline  value  as outcome,  will determine  
between -group  differences  in study  outcomes  post-intervention  period  (9 weeks,  the primary  
outcome)  and at the 26 and 52 week  follow  up points.  Clinical  and demographic  variables  
showing  group  differences  at baseline  will be used as covariates in  the analysis  if they are at 
least moderately  correlated  with changes  in outcomes.105A strength  of the mixed  model  
analysis  approach  is the flexibility  when  data is missing  at random.106 
• Efforts  will be made  to minimize  the amount  of missing  data,  but if missing  data is present,  
the pattern  of missing  data will be determined  to select  the most  appropriate  form  of 
analysis.  Imputation  strategies  will be considered  as sensitivity  analyses  if data are missing  
not at random.107 
 
The analysis  will account  for the correlated  nature  of repeated  outcomes  inherent  in the longitudinal  trial 
design.  The variance -covariance  structure  that best fits the data will be used;  most  likely  this is an AR(1)  
structure.  From  this model  an overall  intervention effect  will be estimated  (pooled  across  time points),  as 
well as intervention  effects  at each of the post-intervention  follow -up time points.105 As a result of the 
pandemic, the structure of the trial has changed.  Previously participants were screened at four locations 
(clinical sites), and randomized to either intervention or control, with the intervention carried out in 
group sessions within eac h location.  In the present configuration, participants are (as before) 
randomized to treatment or control, but the intervention is carried out in virtual groups in specified time 
intervals by intervention teams that are not physical location -specific. Outcome data will be analyzed by 
treatment group as before, but we will include a stratifying factor: an indicator variable for the virtual 
group in a specified time interval to which participants are assigned (i.e. group 1, 2, 3, 4….etc.).  The 
main analy tic model will include a random  effect to account for clustering due to the group intervention .  
 
• To facilitate  interpretation  of trial results,  an analysis  will be done  of group  differences 
(including  95% confidence  intervals)  in proportions  of participants  who experienced  at least a 
25%,  50%,  or 75% increase  in minutes/week  spent  in 10-min bouts  of MVPA  at week  9. 
 
For Aim 2, to determine  the relative  effectiveness  of the two interventions  as measured  by secondary 
physical activity and self -report measures we will employ the same data analytic methods described above.  
In addition, we will conduct secondary analyses in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. These analyses 
will evaluate overall and bet ween -group changes in objective and self -reported physical activity, key st udy 
implementation measures (e.g., intervention adherence, loss to follow -up, adverse events), and other 
secondary self -reported outcome measures by enrollment cohort. We anticipate  4 or more time partition 
strata that can be used 'as is' or grouped  and included as a fixed effect in analytic models  (e.g., 1. prior to 
MN state COVID response measures, 2. MN state 'social distancing' recommendation, 3. MN state 'stay 
home order', 4. Mo re severe lockdown restrictions or a lifting of restrictions). We will also look at trends 
over a continuous timeline. We ack nowledge that the study is likely underpowered for formal statistical 
inference with these added secondary analyses.  
 
Page 51 V10 February 2021  
  For Aim  3, to facilitate  interpretation  of RCT  results  and provide  resources  for translation  and 
sustainability  we will analyze contextual  information  gathered using qualitative methods to  inform  
eventual  broad  scale  intervention  implementation. A sample  of qualitative  texts will be reviewed  to 
gain a general  understanding  of the data and establish  preliminary  codes  as well as a working  
codebook, based on the study’s underlying theoretical frameworks.102-104All qualitative  text will then 
be analyzed  independently  using  NVivo;  periodic  meetings  will be held to revise  the codebook as  
necessary.  Representative  patient  quotations  will be identified  during  the coding  process;  coded  
themes  will be grouped  into larger  thematic  categories.  Themes  will then be quantified  by categorizing  
them  as present  or absent  for each case,  and presented  as frequencies.104 
 
 
10. DATA  COLLECTION  AND  QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
 
10.1 Data  Collection  Forms  
Case  Report  Forms  (CRFs).  CRFs  will be built into REDCap.  The following  case report  forms will  
be used:  
• Initial  screen  — study  registration  information  and data regarding  initial  study  eligibility will  
be directly  entered  on this form  either  through  self-report  by participant  OR trained study  staff 
performing  screening  by phone.  
• Screening  self-report  questionnaires  (BL1  and BL2)  — baseline  self-report  outcomes, 
health  characteristics,  demographics,  and information  on eligibility  will be directly entered  
on these  forms  through  self-report  by participants  
• Follow  up self-report  questionnaires  (Weeks  9, 26, and 52) — will be directly  entered  by 
participants  
• Eligibility  determination  forms  (BL1  and BL2)  — the eligibility  determination  forms  will 
include  a mixture  of data directly  entered  by trained  study  staff and data with source  
documentation  (e.g. verification  of a signed  consent  form).  The BL2 eligibility determination  
form  will include  stratification  variables  for treatment  allocation.  
• Anthropometrics  (BL1)  – direct  entry  of self-report anthropometric  data (height,  weight)  
into REDCap  will be performed  by trained  study  staff.  
• Accelerometer  form (BL2, Weeks 9, 26 and 52) –  – trained  study  staff blinded  to treatment  
assignment  will record information  regarding  wear -time compliance  and objective  physical  
activity  using  scored and  summarized  data from  Actilife  as the source  document.  
• Intervention  administration  form (Sessions 1 -8)— direct  entry  of session  attendance  will 
be done  by trained  study  staff. Direct entry of pre -intervention session (i.e., W0) 
attendance will also be captured.  
 
• Intervention fidelity form (Sessions 1 -8)— direct  entry  of  in-session observation done  by 
trained  study  staff.  
 
• Adverse  event  form ( Post Enrollment: W0 - Week 52)   — direct  entry  of adverse  event  
details  will be performed  by trained study  staff 
• Study  completion  form  (Week 52 or earlier if withdrawal)  – The study  completion  form  will 
Page 52 V10 February 2021  
  include  data directly entered  by trained  study  staff (e.g. reason  for terminating  study  
participation, number  of intervention  visits  completed) . 
 
Source  Documents.  Data  that will serve  as source  documents  include:  
• De-identified  physical  activity  data collected  by accelerometer  and which  will be downloaded  
via ActiLife  software  for secure  management,  processing  and preparation  for analysis.  Ongoing  
ActiLife  software  support  will be provided  through  ActiGraph’s maintenance  agreement  
subscription.  Scored  and summarized  activity  data will be electronically  merged  into the project  
REDCap  database.  
• De-identified  qualitative  data will be securely stored in REDCap. Collected  outside  of 
REDCap  surveys  (e.g. field notes  from  interviews)  will be stored  electronically  on a password -
protected  computer  located  at the University  of Minnesota  in a locked  office,  maintained  by the 
Project  Director.  The computer  is supported  and maintained  by the UMN  AHC -IS with 
regular,  automatic  backups.  
• All paper  source  documents  (e.g. informed  consent  & HIPAA combined form , medical waivers 
if applicable , paper  version  of self-report  questionnaires  in limited  circumstances)  will be 
stored  in a locked  file cabinet,  in a locked office  at the University  of Minnesota  maintained  by 
the Project  Director.  The Project Director  will have  oversight  for all paper  forms  and will route  
the forms  from  participating  YMCA  sites to the UMN.  The Data  Manager  will log the receipt  
of all paper forms.  
• Electronic  source  documents  will be stored  on a password  protected  computer  at the 
University  of Minnesota  in a locked  office,  without  public  access.  The computer  is 
supported  and maintained  by the UMN  Academic  Health  Center -Information  system. 
Participant  ID numbers  will be used to protect  participants’  confidentiality.  
Page 53 V10 February 2021  
   
10.2 Data  Management  
The Principal  Investigator,  Data Manager and  Project  Director  are responsible  for ensuring  the accuracy,  
completeness  and timeliness  of study  data.  All source  documents  will be completed  in a neat,  legible  manner  
to ensure  accurate  interpretation  of data. Case  report  forms  (CRFs),  and source  documentation  will be 
reviewed  regularly  for accuracy.  A description  of data collection  forms  and schedule  of evaluations  are 
provided  in sections  6.1 and 10.1.  
 
10.2.1  Data  security  and storage  
CRFs  for this study  will be entered  into a REDCap  database,  which  uses a MySQL  database  via a secure  web 
interface  with data checks  used during  data entry  to ensure  data quality.  REDCap includes  a complete  suite  of 
features  to support  HIPAA  compliance,  including  a full audit  trail, user -based  privileges,  and integration  with 
the institutional  LDAP  server.  The MySQL  database  and the web server  will both be housed  on secure  servers  
operated  by the University  of Minnesota  Academic  Health  Center’s  Information  Systems  group  (AHC -IS). 
The servers  are in a physically  secure  location  on campus  and are backed  up nightly,  with the backups  stored  
in accordance  with the AHC -IS retention  schedule  of daily,  weekly,  and monthly  tapes  retained  for 1  month,  3 
months,  and 6 months,  respectively.  Weekly  backup  tapes  are stored  offsite.  The AHC -IS servers  provide  a 
stable,  secure,  well-maintained,  and high-capacity  data storage  environm ent, and both REDCap  and MySQL  
are widely -used,  powerful,  reliable,  well-supported systems.  Access  to the study's  data in REDCap  will be 
restricted  to the members  of the study team  by username  and password.  Electronic  communication  with 
outside  collaborators  will involve  only non-identifiable  information  and investigators  will be blinded  to group  
assignment  until after the analysis  by the study  statistician  is complete.  
Electronic  source  documents  will be stored  on a password  protected  computer  at the University of  Minnesota  
in a locked  office,  without  public  access.  The computer  is supported  and maintained  by the UMN  Academic  
Health  Center -Information  system.  Participant  ID numbers will  be used to protect  participants’  
confidentiality.  All paper  source  documents (i.e., medical waivers)  will be stored  in a locked  file cabinet,  in a 
locked  office  at the University  of Minnesota  maintained  by the Project Director and her designees.  De-
identified  physical  activity  data collected  will be downloaded  via ActiLife  software  for secure  management,  
processing  and preparation  for analysis.  Ongoing  ActiLife  software support  will be provided  through  
ActiGraph’s  maintenance  agreement  subscription.  Scored  and summarized  activity  data will be merged  with 
the project  REDCap  database.   
 
10.3 Quality  Assurance  and Quality  Control  
10.3.1  Quality  Assurance  
The primary  method  of data collection  for participant  self-reported  outcomes  will be direct  electronic  entry  
through  a survey  interface  with REDCap.  Logic  rules  specifying  the type and range  of acceptable  responses  
will be programmed  into REDCap.  Participants  will receive  an error  message  if they enter  an invalid  
response.  Physical  activity  measures (primary  outcome  measure)  will be collected  via accelerometry.  Subject  
compliance  with accelerometer  data collection  (e.g. wear  time)  will be assessed  at the relevant  data collection 
timepoints  and procedures  will be outlined  in the study  manual of operations  to enhance  compliance  with 
accelerometer  wear  time.  In addition,  data regarding  accelerometer  wear  time compliance  and the  validity  of 
physical  activity  data will be collected  and actively  monitored.   
 
10.3.2  Quality  Control  
The REDCap  study  database  limits  invalid  character  and out of range responses and tracks missing  
Page 54 V10 February 2021  
  responses.  The Data  Manager  (or designee  not involved  in data entry)  will perform  quality  control  checks  for 
10% of new records  on a monthly basis  by reviewing  source  documents  (i.e. physical  activity  measures).  
Quality  control  checks  will include,  but are not limited  to, verification  of study  eligibility,  completeness  of 
data collection, physical  activity  measure  quality,  and adverse  event  documentation.  Reports  on quality  
control  findings  will be provided  to the PI and study  Steering  Committee  on no less than a monthly basis.  
Study  operating  procedures  will be modified  as necessary  based  on quality  control  findings.  Results  of 
ongoing  quality  assurance  and quality  control  procedures  will be summarized  in Reports  for the Data Safety 
and Monitoring Board.  
 
10.3.3  Training  
Training  for study  staff responsible  for data collection  will be conducted  prior  to study recruitment.  
Certification  by the principal  investigator  (or designee)  requires  adherence  to standard  operating  procedures  
for data collection  outlined  in the study  protocol.  
 
10.3.4  Metrics  
Data on adherence  to the study  protocols  will be collected  by research  staff and reviewed monthly  by the PI 
and the Study  Steering  Committee.  These include study events (e.g. baseline evaluation, enrollment, 
intervention, follow up, adverse event reporting) occurring within specified time frames.  
 
The PI and Steering  Committee  will monitor  the specific  adherence  metrics deta iled in Section 5.4 . If 
adherence  falls below  the rates,  the PI will call a special  meeting  with the Study  Steering  Committee,  co- 
investigators  and others  as needed  (e.g. consultants),  to re-assess  and refine  standard  operating procedures  to 
remedy  the problem.  
 
10.3.5  Protocol  Deviations  
A protocol deviation occurs when, without significant consequences, the activities on this study diverge from 
the UMN IRB approved protocol. Examples include divergence(s), that  
• reduce the quality or completeness of the data,  
• make the Informed Consent For m inaccurate, or  
• impacts a subject's safety, rights, or welfare.  
 
Protocol deviations include, but are not limited to the following:  
• Failure for participants to complete 6/8 intervention sessions  
• Failure to keep IRB approval up to date  
• Outcome assessment and/or measurement not performed  
• Implementing protocol modifications without obtaining prospective IRB approval;  
• Conducting research during a lapse in IRB approval;  
• Enrolling more subjects than what’s approved in the protocol;  
• Performing research procedure s outside the protocol specified window;  
• Failure on the part of any individual involved in research review or oversight to abide by applicable laws 
or regulations, or the University of Minnesota IRB policies.  
• Randomization of an ineligible participant; not -adhering to inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Failure to obtain Informed Consent or altering from the informed consent process as described in the 
IRB approved protocol;  
• Obtaining consent using an outdated consent form;  
• Performing non -exempt human subject res earch without obtaining prospective University IRB approval;  
Page 55 V10 February 2021  
  • Failure to report an SAE  
• Wrong intervention administered to a participant  
 
Protocol  deviations  will be logged  by research staff in REDCap in accordance with the plan described above.  
Details  regarding  the protocol  deviation  including  whether  it resulted in  an adverse  event  or is reportable  to the 
IRB will be included  in the log. Reports  on protocol  deviations  will be reviewed  by the PI and study  Steering  
Committee  on a regular basis.  The DSMB  will be provided  a summary  of protocol  deviations  in regular DSMB 
reports.  
Study  operating  procedures  will be modified  as necessary  based  on review  of protocol  deviation summaries.  
 
10.3.6  Monitoring  
Internal  monitoring  - Automated  queries  will be used to assess  for protocol  deviations  when possible  (e.g. 
missing  evaluations  or evaluations  performed  outside  of allowed  timeframe,  non- compliance  with assigned  
interventions).  Potential  protocol  deviations  that cannot  be identified through  automatic  reports  will be 
monitored  through  quality  control  procedures  outlined  in section  10.3.2  
 
External  monitoring  - A Data  Safety  and Monitoring  Board  has been assigned  to perform  independent  study  
monitoring.  The UMN  IRB and NCCIH  will also review  study  progress.  The PI and the Study  Steering  
Committee  provide  monthly  monitoring  (see Table  2). 
 
Westat  is responsible for conducting NCCIH site monitoring visits. Monitoring visits include review of 
regulatory/essential documents, 100% of informed consents for enrolled participants, select participant records 
(e.g., source documentation, case report forms,  and/or database entries) including documents that contain PHI, 
and other relevant study materials. Due to COVID -19, Westat will conduct monitoring visits remotely in lieu 
of on -site monitoring visits. If it is safe to do so in the future, Westat may retur n to on -site (versus remote) 
monitoring.   
 
Research staff will provide a current list of enrolled participant ID numbers to the monitor upon request. For 
the remote visit, research records, with PHI, will be uploaded by study staff to the HIPAA secure UMN  Box 
(e.g., signed informed consent forms, HIPAA forms (if separate from the consent form), medical waivers). 
The Westat monitor will be given access to study documents in the UMN Box system to review per the 
monitoring requirements. Additional regulatory/ essential documents will be uploaded to Zoom for review 
(e.g., IRB approval letters (notices of continuing review), delegation logs, human subjects training 
certificates, conflict of interest forms).  
 
The Westat monitor will also view select records that contain PHI, in the project database, REDCap, to 
review remotely. UMN staff will make select records available for the Westat monitor to review via HIPAA 
compliant Zoom videoconference. The Zoom videoconference meeting will not be recorded. Westat will not  
be given access to the full REDCap database. To protect participant’s confidentiality, records will be 
reviewed in a private space. Only the Westat monitor and designated study staff member will be invited to the 
videoconference review.

11. PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS  AND  CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
11.1 Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  Review  
This protocol  and the informed  consent  document  and any subsequent  modifications  is reviewed  and 
approved  by the IRB.  
 
11.2 Informed  Consent  Forms  
A signed  consent (e-consent or written) form  will be obtained  from  each participant.  The consent  form  will 
describe  the purpose  of the study,  the procedures  to be followed,  and the risks  and benefits  of participation.  A 
copy  will be given  to each participant  and this fact will be documented  in the participant’s record (REDCap).  
See Section  6.  
 
11.3 Participant  Confidentiality  
Procedures  are in place  for maintaining  the full confidentiality  of all information  collected. Participant  
confidentiality  will be protected  by securing  all hard copy  study  files in locked  filing cabinets.  Electronic  files 
containing  personal  identifiers  will be stored  on secure  servers  operated by  the UMN  AHC -IS. All study  staff 
receive  training  on privacy  standards  for maintaining  participant  confidentiality.  All published  reports  will be 
of summary  nature  and no individual  subjects  will be identified  beyond  the investigative  staff involved  in the 
project.  
 
11.4 Study  Discontinuation  
The study  may be discontinued  at any time by the IRB,  the NCCIH,  the OHRP,  or other government  agencies  
Page 57 V10 February 2021  
  as part of their duties  to ensure  that research  participants  are protected.  
 
12. COMMITTEES

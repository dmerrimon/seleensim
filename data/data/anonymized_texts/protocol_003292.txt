 Overall Study Design:  All participants will be evaluated for their eligibility for enrollment 
in the Vaccination Period and will be followed for approximately 
6 months (Day  196) after their last IP injection . All participants in all 
treatment arms will have the opportunity to continue to be followed 
as part of an approximately 24 -month Extension Period (through 
Day 700) after their last IP injection . 
A total of approximately 800 participants will be randomly assigned 
to receive either  µg or  µg mRNA -1893  administered as a 
2-dose regimen with at least a 28 -day interval between vaccinations 
(Treatment Arm  A or Treatment Arm B), or  µg mRNA -1893 
administered as a 1 -dose regimen (Treatment Arm C), or plac ebo 
control administered as a 2 -dose regimen with at least a 28 -day 
interval between doses (Treatment Arm  D) according to a 1:1:1:1 
randomization ratio (ie, 200  participants per treatment arm  with 
approximately 100 participants per baseline flavivirus sero status in 
each treatment arm). Randomization was stratified by participants’ 
baseline flavivirus serostatus in the original protocol (dated 
21 Feb 2021). Under this current protocol amendment, 
randomization will be stratified only by participants’ region 
(continental United States [ US] and Puerto Rico). All treatment arms 
will be enrolled in parallel. In order to maintain the blinding and to 
have the same study evaluation time point with both mRNA -1893 
dose regimens relative to the last IP injection , partic ipants randomly 
assigned to Treatment Arm  C will be administered placebo at Day  1 
and mRNA -1893 at Day  29.  
Participants will be observed for immediate safety assessment for 
30 minutes after IP injection . They will be asked to record solicited 
local and systemic ARs within 7  days after each administration and 
unsolicited AEs within 28  days after each administration by 
completing eDiaries. They will also be asked to report any SAEs , 
AESI s, or MAAEs from fi rst vaccination until End of Study (up to 
24 months after the last IP injection ).  
Blood samples will be collected from all participants for 
immunogenicity analyses. A subset of participants identified as the 
“CMI subset”, approximately 20 participants  per treatment arm per 
serostatus subgroup (approximately 160  participants in total), will be 
selected from approximately  4 sites that have experience in human 
cell collection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be 
isolated from blood samples from  the CMI subset participants and 
evaluated for cellular immunity up to Day  196 with an optional 
participation every 6  months up to Day  700 for the participants 
included in the Extension Period.  
All participants will have up to 8  clinic visits (Days  0 [Elig ibility 
Visit], 1  [baseline] , 8, 29, 36, 57, 85, and 196) and 3 safety telephone 
calls (Days  112, 140, and 168). Participants who continue into the 
Extension Period will have 3  additional clinic visits at Days  364, 532, 
and 700.

 Participants who withdraw f rom further IP injection  for any reason 
after their first IP injection  but do not withdraw consent will complete 
all study procedures through the End of Study (EOS) Visit.  
Study Safety Oversight:  Study safety will be monitored by an Oversight Safety Team that will 
include the investigators participating in the study and the protocol 
team, which will include the  contract research organization ( CRO) 
Medical Monitor and the Sponsor Clinical Development Physician 
and may include additional representatives from  the Sponsor Project 
Team. The CRO Medical Monitor will be responsible for performing 
a review of the enrollment and study -related safety data with 
oversight by the Sponsor Clinical Development Physician. During 
the Vaccination Period, a formal biweekly me eting/teleconference 
will be scheduled among the CRO Medical Monitor, the Sponsor 
Clinical Development Physician, and the Lead Investigator (or 
alternate investigator) to review safety events in a blinded fashion. 
Once all participants in all treatment arm s enter the Follow -Up 
Period, the interval of these meetings may be extended to monthly. 
This decision will be confirmed by the protocol team.  
In addition, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
will be established for Study mRNA -1893 -P201. It will be composed 
of experts with experience in clinical development and vaccines and 
with expertise in flaviviruses. Members of the DSMB will be 
independent from the study conduct and free of conflict of interest. 
The DSMB will convene on an approximately quarterly basis until 
study end. Additionally, the DSMB may convene at any time if there 
is an ad -hoc safety concern detected by the protocol team. This 
independent board will be informed of the progress and conduct of 
the study; their primary responsibili ty will be to review unblinded 
study data to evaluate the safety findings. All AEs, SAEs, AESI s and 
MAAEs will be reviewed by the board, and they will be asked to 
provide recommendations and guidance as to management of 
follow -up within the study. In addit ion, should immunogenicity 
findings request further opinion, the DSMB would be asked to review 
unblinded immunogenicity data and provide guidance.  
Study Duration:  The planned study duration will be approximately 6  months for all 
participants. Additionally , all participants will have the opportunity 
to provide their consent to participate in the Extension Period of up 
to approximately 24  months (through Day  700) after their last IP 
injection . 
Population:  The study will enroll approximately 800 adult participants aged 18  
through 65 years at baseline, including approximately 400  
flavivirus -seropositive participants  and 400  flavivirus -seronegative 
participants, who will receive mRNA -1893 or placebo.  
Flavivirus  serology  testing  (to determine  if a participant  is flavivirus  
seronegative  or flavivirus  seropositive  at baseline)  is not an 
enrollment  criterion.  A dengue  rapid  point -of-care test initially  used 
to stratify  study  participants  has been  discontinued . After  this 
protocol  amendment,  all participants  will be stratified  based  on

 geographic  region , assuming  most  of the baseline  seronegatives  will 
come  from  the continental  US sites and baseline  seropos itives  from  
Puerto  Rico.  The confirmation  will be based  on flavivirus  serology  
testing  (dengue  immunoglobulin  G (IgG) and immunoglobulin  M 
(IgM), West  Nile IgG and IgM)  performed  on a blood  sample  
collected  prior  to administration  of the first vaccination , with a goal 
of an approximately  equal  distribution  of participants  among  
seronegative  and seropositive  participants  within  each treatment  
group. 
Number of Participants:  Approximately  800 
Sample Size    
Determination:  The sample  size for this study  is not driven  by statistical  assumptions  
for formal  hypothesis  testing.  This sample  size is regarded  as 
sufficient  to provide  an understanding  of the safety  profile  of 
mRNA -1893  and to confirm  the dose selection  to advance  
development  into future  studies.   
Approximately  800 participants  will be randomly  assigned  in a 
1:1:1:1  ratio to the 4 treatm ent arms.  A total of 600 participants  will 
receive  mRNA -1893,  200 participants  in each dosing  arm, with 
approximately  100 participants  in each flavivirus  serostatus  cohort  
and dosing  arm; approximately  200 participants  will receive  placebo . 
A sample  size of 200 (or 400) has at least a 95% probability  to 
observe  at least 1 participant  with an AE at a true 1.49% (or 0.75%)  
AE rate. 
For the comparison  of immunogenicity,  the sample  size will provide  
adequate  statistical  power  (approximately  90%)  to detect  a large  
effect  size (4-fold or above  in ZIKV -specific  nAb titers,  as measured  
by PRNT50  at Day 57) under  reasonable  assumptions.  
Inclusion Criteria:  Participants  are eligible  to be included  in the study  only if all the 
following  criteria  apply:  
1. Male  or female  participant  aged  18 through  65 years  at the time 
of consent.  
2. Understands  and agrees  to comply  with the study  procedures  and 
provides  written  informed  consent.  
3. According  to investigator  assessment,  is in good  general  health

4. Female  participants  of nonchildbearing  potential  may be enrolled  
in the study.  Nonchildbearing  potential  is defined  as surgically  
sterile  (history  of bilateral  tubal  ligation,  bilateral  oophorectomy,  
hysterectomy)  or postmenopausal  (defined  as amenorrhea  for 
≥ 12 consecutive  months  prior  to the eligibility  evaluation  
without  an alternative  medical  cause).  The follicle -stimulating  
hormone  level  may be measured  at the discretion  of the 
investigator  to confirm  postmenopausal  status.  
5. Female  participants  of childbearing  potential  may be enrolled  in 
the study  if the participant:  1) has a negative  pregnancy  test at the 
Eligibility  Visit  and on the day of the first IP injection , 2) has 
practiced  adequate  contraception  or has abstained  from  all

to the first IP injection , 3) has agreed  to continue  adequate  
contraception  through  3 months  following  the last IP injection , 
and 4) is not currently  breastfeeding.   
Adequate  female  contraception  is defined  as consistent  and 
correct  use of a Food  and Drug  Administration -approved  
contraceptive  method  in accordance  with the product  label.  
Examples  are as follows:  
• Barrier  method  (such  as condoms,  diaphragm,  or cervical  
cap) used in conjunction  with spermicide.  
• Intrauterine  device.  
• Prescription  hormonal  contraceptive  taken  or administered  
via oral (pill),  transdermal  (patch),  subdermal,  or 
intramuscular  (IM)  route.  
• Sterilization  of a female  participant’s  monogamous  male  
partner  prior  to entry  into the study.  
Note:  periodic  abstinence  (eg, calendar  ovulation,  
symptothermal  post-ovulation  methods)  and withdrawal  are not 
acceptable  methods  of contraception.   
Exclusion Criteria:  Participants  are excluded  from  the study  if any of the following  
criteria  apply:

Investigational Products, 
Dosage, and Route of 
Administration:  mRNA -1893  consists  of a messenger  RNA  sequence  that encodes  the 
full pre-membrane  and envelope  structural  polyprotein  of ZIKV  in a 
liposomal  formulation.  
The lipid nanoparticle  formulation  includes  4 lipid excipients  (1 
proprietary  and 3 commercially  available).  mRNA -1893  will be 
provided  as a 0.20 mg/mL  dispersion  in 2R glass  vials  labeled  as 
required  per country  requirement.  The vaccine  will be diluted  with 
0.9%  sodium  chloride  solution  for injection  (United  States  
Pharmacopeia  [USP]  or British  Pharmacopeia  [BP])  to a 
concentration  for delivery  of the specified  dose level  in a volume  of 
0.5 mL. 
The IP will be administered  as an IM injection  into the deltoid  muscle  
on a 2-dose dose schedule  on Days  1 and 29, with at least a 28-day 
interval  between  doses.  Each  dose will have a volume  of 0.5 mL and 
will contain  either  mRNA -1893   µg or mRNA -1893   µg, or 
placebo.  Preferably,  the first dose should  be injected  into the 
nondominant  arm. The second  dose should  be injected  into the same  
arm as the first dose.  
The placebo  is 0.9%  sodium  chloride  solution  for injection,  USP or 
BP. 
Unblinded  pharmacy  personnel,  who will not participate  in any other  
aspect  of the study,  will perform  IP accountability,  IP preparation,  
and administration.  
Assessments and 
Procedures:  Safety  Assessments:   
Safety  assessments  will include  monitoring  and recording  of the 
following  for each participant:  
• Solicited  local  and systemic  ARs that occur  during  the 7 days 
following  each IP injection  (ie, the day of injection  and 6 
subsequent  days).  Solicited  ARs will be recorded  daily  using  
electronic  diaries  (eDiaries).  
• Unsolicited  AEs observed  or reported  during  the 28 days 
following  each IP injection  (ie, the day of injection  and 27 
subsequent  days).  Unsolicited  AEs are AEs that are not included  
in the protocol -defined  solicited  ARs.   
• AEs leading  to discontinuation  from  IP and/or  study  participation  
throughout  the entire  study  duration  (up to Day 700).   
• MAAEs  from  Day 1 throughout  the entire  study  duration  (up to 
Day 700).  
• SAEs  and AESI s from  Day 1 throughout  the entire  study  duration  
(up to Day 700).  
• Physical  examination  findings.   
• Vital  sign measurements.

 Immunogenicity  Assessments:  
Immunogenicity  assessments  will include  the following:   
• Serum  ZIKV -specific  nAb titers,  as measured  by PRNT  assay,  
MN assay,  and RVP  assay.   
• Serum  ZIKV -specific  bAb concentrations,  as measured  by ligand  
binding  assay.  
• Frequency  of ZIKV -specific  T cells,  as measured  by ICS assay  
and sequencing  and frequency  of ZIKV -specific  B cells,  as 
measured  by ELISpot.  Other  techniques  that may be relevant  to 
assess  the profile  characteristics  of the ZIKV -specific  T- and 
B-cell responses  may be included.  
Efficacy  Assessments:  
• Asymptomatic  flavivirus  infections,  assessed  through  
quantification  of NS1 bAbs,  as measured  by ELISA.  
• Symptomatic  flavivirus  infections,  assessed  by specific  serology  
(IgM antibody  capture  ELISA  and virus  neutralization  assay)  
and RT-PCR.  
Statistical Plan:  Populations  for Analyses:   
• The Randomized  Set consists  of all participants  who are 
randomized  in the study,  regardless  of the participant’s  treatment  
status  in the study.  Participants  will be included  in the treatment  
arm to which  they are randomized.  
• The Solicited  Safety  Set consists  of all participants  who are 
randomly  assigned  and received  any IP and contribute  any 
solicited  AR data.  The Solicited  Safety  Set will be used for the 
analyses  of solicited  ARs and participants  will be included  in the 
treatment  arm corresponding  to the IP they actually  received.  
• The Safety  Set consists  of all participants  who are randomly  
assigned  and received  any IP. The Safety  Set will be used for 
analysis  of safety  except  for the solicited  ARs.  Participants  will 
be included  in the treatment  arm corresponding  to the IP they 
actually  received  for the analysis  of safety  data using  the Safety  
Set. 
• The Full Analysis  Set (FAS)  consists  of all participants  who are 
randomly  assigned  and a) received  any IP, b) have  baseline  (Day  
1) data available  for those  analyses  that require  baseline  data,  and 
c) have  at least 1 post-IP injection  assessment  for those  analysis  
endpoints  as specified  in b). Participants  will be included  in the 
treatment  arm to which  they are randomly  assigned.  
• The Per-Protocol  (PP) Set consists  of all FAS participants  who 
a) comply  with the vaccination  schedule,  b) comply  with the 
timings  of immunogenicity  blood  sampling  to have  post-IP 
injection  results  available  for at least 1 assay  component  
corresponding  to the immunogenicity  analysis  objective,  and c) 
have  no major  protocol  deviations  that impact  immune  response  
during  the period  corresponding  to the immunogenicity  analysis  
objective.  The PP set will serve  as the primary  population  for the

 analysis  of immunogenicity  data in this study.  Participants  will 
be included  in the treatment  arm to which  they are randomly  
assigned.  
Safety  Analyses:  
Safety  analyses  will include  solicited  ARs (local  and systemic),  
unsolicited  AEs,  SAEs,  AESI s, MAAEs,  and AEs leading  to 
vaccine/study  withdrawal,  and vital sign measurement s. 
Solicited  ARs,  unsolicited  AEs,  and vital sign measurements  will be 
graded  according  to the Toxicity  Grading  Scale  for Healthy  Adult  
and Adolescent  Volunteers  Enrolled  in Preventive  Vaccine  Clinical  
Trials  (DHHS  2007).  
All safety  analyses  will be based  on the Safety  Set, except  analyses  
of solicited  ARs which  will be based  on the Solicited  Safety  Set. All 
safety  analyses  will be provided  by treatment  arm overall  (regardless  
of serostatus ) and by baseline  flavivirus  status  assessed  by dengue  
and West  Nile specific  serologies , and vaccination  (first,  second),  
unless  otherwise  specified.  
Solicited  local  and systemic  ARs during  the 7-day follow -up period  
after each IP injection  will be tabulated  by number  and percentage  of 
participants  reporting  ≥ 1 event.  The number  and percentage  of 
participants  with any solicited  local  AR, with any solicited  systemic  
AR, and with any solicited  AR during  the 7-day follow -up period  
after each IP injection  will be provided  with a 2-sided  95% exact  CI 
using  the Clopper -Pearson  method.  
Unsolicited  AEs will be coded  according  to the Medical  Dictionary  
for Regulatory  Activities  (Dictionary  for Adverse  Reaction  
Terminology  version).  Unsolicited  AEs,  treatment -related  AEs,  
SAEs,  AESI s, MAAEs,  and AEs leading  to discontinuation  from  IP 
or participation  in the study,  severe  AEs,  and deaths  will be reported  
by number  and percentage  of participants  reporting  ≥ 1 event,  and 
number  of events.  
Demographic  variables  (eg, age, height,  weight,  and BMI)  and 
baseline  characteristics  will be summarized  by treatment  arm overall  
(regardless  of baseline  serostatus)  and by baseline  flavivirus  status  
assessed  by dengue  and West  Nile specific  serologies  and treatment  
arm by descriptive  statistics  (mean,  median,  minimum,  maximum,  
and standard  deviation  for continuous  variable,  and number  and 
percentage  for categorical  variables).  
Further  details  will be described  in the statistical  analysis plan (SAP).  
Immunogenicity  Analyses:  
Immunogenicity  analyses  will be conducted  on the PP set, reported  
by treatment  arm overall  and by baseline  flavivirus  status  assessed  by 
dengue  and West  Nile specific  serologies , as applicable . If the 
number  of participants  in the FAS and PP set differ  by more  than 
10%,  supportive  immunogenicity  analyses  may be conducted  on the 
FAS.

 For the primary  and secondary  immunogenicity  endpoints,  
descriptive  summary  statistics  of antibody -mediated  immunogenicity  
at each time point  will include  GMT  (for nAbs)  median,  minimum,  
maximum,  95% CI, and GMFR  of post-baseline/baseline  nAb titers.   
For GMT  calculation s, antibody  titers  reported  as below  the LLOQ  
will be replaced  by 0.5 × LLOQ.  Values  that are greater  than the 
upper  limit  of quantification  (ULOQ)  will be converted  to the ULOQ.  
The number  and percentage  of participants  with seroconversion  will 
be provided  with 2-sided  95% CI using  Clopper -Pearson  method  by 
treatment  arm overall  and also by the baseline  flavivirus  serostatus.   
The number  and percentage  of participants  with seroresponse  will be 
provided  with 2-sided  95% CI using  Clopper -Pearson  method  by 
treatment  arm overall  and in baseline  flavivirus -seronegative  
participants.  
The number  and percentage  of participants  with ≥ 2- or ≥ 4-fold rise 
in ZIKV -specific  nAb titers  will be provided  with 2-sided  95% CI 
using  Clopper -Pearson  at each post-baseline  timepoint.  
Further  details  will be described  in the SAP.  
Study  Planned  Analyses:  
The following  analyses  will be conducted  on cleaned  data:   
1. An interim  analysis  (IA) of safety  and immunogenicity  data will 
be performed  after all participants  have  completed  Day 57 (28 
days after the last IP injection ). The Day 57 IA will be performed  
by a separate  team  of unblinded  programmers  and statisticians.  
Pre-identified  Sponsor  team  members  will be unblinded  to 
review  treatment  level  results,  as defined  in the study  Data  
Blinding  Plan.  The unblinded  statistics  team  will not be involved  
in either  study  design  or the regular  study  conduct.  The 
participants  and study  sites will remain  blinded  until the 
conclusion  of the study.  The IA will serve  as the basis  for the 
progression  to the ZIKV  Phase  3 studies.  
2. The final clinical  study  report  (CSR)  will include  full unblinded  
analyses  of all safety  and immunogenicity  with individual  
unblinded  listings  through  Day 196 (all data through  
approximately  6 months  after the last IP injection ).  
3. An addendum  to the CSR will include  the safety  and 
immunogenicity  data from  Month  8 until EOS for all participants  
enrolled  in the Extension  Period.   
More  details  can be found  in the SAP.  
In addition,  unblinded  data presentation  or analysis  for DSMB  review  
will be handled  by the unblinded  team  of statisticians  and 
programmers,  who are not involved  in study  design.  More  details  
regarding  DSMB  analysis  can be found  in the DSMB  Charter.

only be collected a t Day  1. Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other scheduled timepoints (X) at the discretion of the investigator. Vita l sign 
measurements (body temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate) wi ll be collected before study procedures and at least 30 minutes after 
IP injection, prior to discharge of the participant from the study site. Any clinically significant finding identified during  a study visit should be reported as an MAAE. Body 
mass index  will be calculated ( Section  8.5.3 ) during the eligibility evaluation.  
4 Flavivirus serology testing is to determine if a participant is flavivirus seronegative or flavivirus seropositive at baselin e. This is not an enrollment criterion. However, this 
flavivirus serology testing needs to be performed on a blood sample collected  prior to administration of the first vaccination to confirm that the study distribution among 
subgroups is respected.  
5 Follicle -stimulating hormone level may be measured to confirm menopausal status at the discretion of the investigator.

8 Pregnancy testing at the Eligibility Visit (Day  0) and before each IP injection  (or at any time at the discretion of the investigator) will be a point -of-care urine test.  
9 Participants will be administered the IP (mRNA -1893 or placebo) according to the randomization. Participant will remain at the study site for safety monito ring for at least 
30 minutes after IP injection.  
10 Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any MAAEs, SAEs , AESI s, AEs leading to study discontinuation, concomitant medications 
associated with those events, and a ny nonstudy vaccinations.  
11 Blood  samples collected from all participants  at Visit 6 (Day 85) and Visit 10 (Day 196)  will be used for detection of asymptomatic flavivirus infections. In case of signs or 
symptoms suggesting a flavivirus infection (mostly dengue and Zika in the areas where the study will be performed), an additi onal blood sample will be collected to confirm 
the diagnos is via specific serology and RT -PCR, and clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case. Those symptoms are n ot 
specific; however, an association of acute fever onset with maculopapular rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis during the seasonal circulation of mosquitos must trigger 
samplings. Also, special attention will be paid to the reporting of neurological signs or symptoms evoking Guillain -Barré syndrome.  
12 At Visit  10 (Day  196), all participants will have the opportunity to provide their consent to participate in the Extension Period ( Table  2).

temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate) will be collected before study procedur es. Any clinically significant finding identified 
during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
2 Blood samples collected from all participants at Visits 11, 12, and EOS (Days 364, 532, and 700, respectively) will be used for detection of asymptomatic flavivirus 
infections. In case of signs or symptoms suggesting a flavivirus infection (mostly  dengue and Zika in the areas where the study will be performed), a n additional  blood sample 
will be taken to confirm the diagnosis via specific serology and RT -PCR, and clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clini cal case. 
Special attention will be paid to collect signs or symptoms possibly related to Guillain -Barré syndrome.

 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Study Rationale  
The purpose of this Phase  2 randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled, dose confirmation 
study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of messenger RNA ( mRNA )-1893 
in adults aged 18 through 65  years living in endemic and non -endemic flavivirus areas.  
2.2. Background and Overview  
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito -borne and sexually transmitted single -stranded RNA virus of the 
Flaviviridae family, which includes yellow fever, d engue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis 
viruses. First discovered in 1947, ZIKV was recognized sporadically as a cause of mild, 
self-limited febrile illness in Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2007 , an outbreak occurred on the North 
Pacific island of Yap,  subsequently spreading through Oceana to re -emerge in 2013 and 2014 in 
an outbreak in French Polynesia before spreading to the Americas in 2015 ( Duffy  et al 2009 ; 
Derraik and Slaney  2015 ; Campos  et al 2015 ). The outbreaks from 2015 onward have been of 
major public health concern due to their associated clinical complications such as Guillain -Barré 
syndrome in adults and a wide range of birth defects, including microcephaly, intrauterine growth 
restriction, and spontaneous abortion ( Brasil  et al 2016 ; Cao-Lormeau  et al 2016 ). 
The devastating consequences of ZIKV infection led the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
declare a public health emergency of international concern on 01  Feb 2016 ( Heymann  et al 2016 ) 
and to call on the global research and development communities to prioritize the development of 
preventive and therapeutic solutions ( WHO  2016a ). Although the WHO declared an end to its 
global health emergency over the spread of ZIKV in November 2016, the long -term need for a 
ZIKV vaccine continues ( WHO  2019) as a priority need under the Blueprint plan of action 
(WHO  2016b ). 
Currently there is no approved vaccine to protect against ZIKV disease.  
To address the public health need, the Sponsor is developing mRNA -1893, a prophylactic vaccine 
against ZIKV. mRNA -1893 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) -encapsulated mRNA -based 
vaccine directed against the pre -membrane and envelope (prME) structural proteins of ZIKV. 
Following uptake of the LNP by the cell, the mRNA is translated and processed within the cytoso l 
by the host cell, stimulating endogenous production of structurally intact protein antigens in a way 
that mimics wild -type viral infection and is able to induce highly targeted immune responses 
against infectious pathogens. Details on the mechanism of ac tion and a summary of nonclinical 
studies of mRNA -1893 can be found in Section  2.2.1 .

 mRNA -1893 was tested in a Phase 1 clinical study (Study mRNA -1893 -P101; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of 4 dose levels (  µg) in a liquid 
formulation in approximately 100 healthy flavivirus -seronegative adults and 20  healthy flavivirus -
seropositive adults. The study was performed at 4 sites (3 in the continental United States [US] 
and 1 in Puerto Rico). Additional details on this clinical study and other clinical studies across the 
Sponsor’s infectious disease vaccine platform with mRNA vaccines  using  the same novel  
heptadec an-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)(6 -oxo-6(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate 
(SM-102)-containing lipid formulation are described in Section  2.2.2 . 
The Phase  2 Study mRNA -1893 -P201 is intended to confirm the safety and immunogenicity trends 
observed during the Phase 1 study. Two dose levels and 2 dosing schedules of mRNA -1893 will 
be tes ted in this Phase  2 study for comparison to a placebo  control . The 2 dose levels,  µg and 
 µg, will be compared for a 2 -dose schedule, with doses 28 days apart. One single dose of the 
 µg-dose level will also be tested to explore its safety profile  and characterize the intensity and 
persistence of the ZIKV -specific immune response.  
The Phase  2 primary study objectives will be the Day  57 assessment for humoral immunogenicity 
and safety with a planned study end date approximately 6  months after the la st investigational 
product ( IP) injection  (Day  196) for all treatment arms. However, the study will be extended to 
approximately 24 months after the last IP injection  for all participants who elect to enroll to assess 
the long -term safety of mRNA -1893, to assess the persistence of the ZIKV -specific immune 
response, and to capture the eventual occurrence of flavivirus infections.  
The Phase 2 study has already started to enroll participants ; however , goals and treatment arms 
will not change  with the current protocol amendment .  
The Phase 2 study will be conducted under US Investigational New Drug application in accordance 
with the protocol, International Council for Harmonization  (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
2.2.1.  Nonclinical Studies  
In support of development of mRNA -1893 for prophylaxis against ZIKV infection, nonclinical 
immunogenicity, biodistribution, and safety studies have been completed with mRNA -1893 or 
similar mRNA -based vaccines formulated in SM -102-containing LNPs.  
In a non -Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in vivo dose -range finding study, immunogenicity 
(binding antibody [bAb] and neutralizing antibody [nAb] titers) to the mRNA -1893 encoded 
protein was evaluated in female C57BL/6 mice at 4 doses  µg) following 
intramuscular (IM) injection on Days  1 and 29. mRNA -1893 generated strong nAb and bAb titers

 at multiple doses. Mice dosed with  µg mRN A-1893 generated higher nAb and bAb titers 
than mice dosed with  µg mRNA -1893. Mice dosed with  µg mRNA -1893 
generated higher bAb titers compared with mice dosed with  µg mRNA -1893.  
The immunogenicity and efficacy of mRNA -1893 were evalu ated in a non -GLP study in the rhesus 
macaque ZIKV infection model. A total of 40 monkeys were randomly assigned to 1 of 7  groups 
to receive mRNA -1893  µg), ZIKV purified inactivated vaccine (ZPIV 
[400 antigenic units]), a formalin -inactivated ZIKV strain PRVABC59 shown to be immunogenic 
in human, or buffer control. Dose administration occurred via IM injection on Day  0 and Day  28. 
Following blood collections on Day  56, animals were challenged by subcutaneous injection with 
a target d ose of 1  × 105 plaque -forming units of ZIKV strain PRVABC59. Overall, administration 
of mRNA -1893 by IM injection (2  doses) was clinically well tolerated, with no 
mRNA -1893 -related mortality, clinical observations, or changes in body weight. Animals in the  
buffer control group developed viremia that persisted for 3 to 7  days, whereas mRNA -1893 - and 
ZPIV -treated animals were either negative for ZIKV RNA at all time points evaluated or had 
sporadic instances of low levels of ZIKV RNA at a single time point af ter ZIKV challenge. 
Detection of ZIKV RNA was inversely related to detection of ZIKV nAbs prior to ZIKV challenge. 
mRNA -1893 – and/or ZPIV -treated animals had detectable nAb titers in the ZIKV 
microneutralization (MN) assay at Days  28 and 56 as well as at t he End of Study (EOS) (Day  77, 
21 days after ZIKV challenge), whereas animals in the buffer control group did not have 
ZIKV -neutralizing titers until after ZIKV challenge on Day  77. 
Overall, these results demonstrate that mRNA -1893 generates strong immunog enic response in 
mice and non -human primates and prevents viremia, with either no or low levels of ZIKV RNA 
upon challenge in the rhesus macaque ZIKV infection model.  
To evaluate the generalized tissue distribution and tissue half -life of mRNA -1893, the 
biodistribution of mRNA -1647, a similar mRNA -based vaccine formulated in SM -102-containing 
LNPs, was evaluated in male rats. mRNA -1647 is a novel mRNA -based cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
vaccine formulated in a mixture of the same 4 lipids as mRNA -1893. The biodistr ibution of 
mRNA -based vaccines formulated in LNPs is predicted to be driven by the LNP characteristics. 
Therefore, mRNAs that are within an LNP of the same composition (eg, mRNA -1893 and 
mRNA -1647) are expected to distribute similarly. Overall, only a rela tively small fraction of the 
administered mRNA -1647 dose distributed to distant tissues, and the mRNA constructs did not 
persist past 1 to 3 days in tissues other than the vaccination site, lymph nodes, and spleen.  
The safety and tolerability of 3 dose le vels of mRNA -1893 administered by IM injection were 
evaluated in a GLP -compliant, repeat dose (1 month; 3 doses) toxicity study in Sprague Dawley 
rats followed by a 2 -week recovery period. Animals were administered mRNA -1893 at doses of

  µg/do se or phosphate buffered saline via IM injection on Days 1, 15, and 29. The 
results of this study indicated that administration of mRNA -1893 was clinically tolerated in rats 
up to  μg/dose with no mortality or changes in body weight or food consumption. Starting at 
 μg/dose, dose -dependent clinical signs (swelling/firmness/redness/scabs) at the injection site, 
changes in clinical pathology parameters and cytokines concentrations, and an increase in body 
temperature were observed and were consistent with  an inflammatory reaction. Dose -dependent 
effects were observed at the vaccination site, spleen, liver, and seminal vesicle of animals given 
mRNA -1893. Additional microscopic findings in the iliac, inguinal, and popliteal lymph nodes or 
their perinodal tis sue; perineural tissue of the sciatic nerve; spleen (extramedullary hematopoiesis); 
and bone marrow of animals given mRNA -1893 were considered to be an extension, a secondary 
response, or a reactive response to the vaccination site inflammation. At the end  of the 2 -week 
recovery period, all changes were partially or fully recovered.  
In GLP -compliant studies, SM -102, the novel lipid component of the LNP formulation, was not 
genotoxic when tested in a bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test or an in vitro mic ronucleus test. 
An in vivo micronucleus study in Sprague Dawley rats showed that a similar mRNA -based vaccine 
formulated in SM -102 containing LNPs (mRNA -1706, which encodes the ZIKV prME  
polypeptide [different from the sequence encoded in mRNA -1893]), indu ced statistically 
significant increases in micronucleated immature erythrocytes in male rats at both 24  and 48 hours 
and in female rats at 48 hours only; however, there was no clear dose response, and the increases 
were generally weak and associated with m inimal bone marrow toxicity. These observations 
indicate that the risk to humans after IM administration is low due to minimal systemic exposure.  
A detailed review of nonclinical experience with mRNA -1893 is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).  
2.2.2.  Clinical Studies  
mRNA -1893 was tested in a Phase 1 clinical study (Study mRNA -1893 -P101; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of 4 dose levels  µg) in a liquid 
formulation in approximately a total of 120 participants ag ed 18 through 49  years (  per dose 
level with 25 baseline flavivirus -seronegative and 5 flavivirus -seropositive participants). The 
study was performed at 4 sites (3 in the continental US and 1 in Puerto Rico). Group unblinding 
interim analyses performed a t Day 57 (ie, 28 days after the second vaccine administration of the 
 µg dose levels) showed a safety profile compatible with a large use of the 
vaccine candidate and a production of ZIKV -specific nAbs, as measured by plaque reduction 
neutralization test (PRNT), at a seroconversion rate (SCR) of 86.4% (65.1%  - 97.1%) at  µg 
dose level, 95.5% (77.2%  - 99.9%) at  µg dose level, 100% (85.8%  - 100%) at  µg dose

immunogenicity evaluations performed at Month 6 and Month 13 is under preparation.   
The Sponsor has demonstrated several mRNA vaccines to confer protection again st a variety of 
pathogens in addition to Zika virus, including SARS -CoV -2, influenza virus, and chikungunya 
virus, in a variety of animal species such as mice, rats, cotton rats, ferrets, and non-human primates . 
As of February 2021, mRNA vaccines with SM-102-containing lipid formulations are currently 
being evaluated for infectious disease indications  including : prophylactic protection against 
coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID -19) caused by the SARS -CoV -2 virus ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], NCT0 4283461), human CMV ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]),  
human metapneumovirus/parainfluenza virus Type 3 (hMPV/PIV3; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , influenza  virus  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , and Zika virus ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) infections. The Sponsor’s COVID -19 vaccine 
received authorization in the US for emergency use to prevent COVID -19 infections in adults on 
18 Dec 2020.  
A detailed review of clinical experience with LNPs containing SM -102 (mRNA vaccines and 
placebo) is provided in the I B. 
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Approximately 600  participants will be exposed to mRNA -1893 in this study; approximately 
200 participants will receive placebo.  
A summary of the potential risks and benefits of mRNA -1893 is provided in the current IB.  
2.3.1.  Known Potential Benefits  
Participants who receive mRNA -1893 may or may not directly benefit from vaccination as the 
protective efficacy of mRNA -1893 has yet to be established.  
Participants  can obtain medical advice about their general health status through the medical 
evaluations/assessments associated with this study. 
Participants will be contributing to the process of developing a new potentially prophylactic 
measure against ZIKV in an area of unmet medical need, should ZIKV epidemics re -emerge . 
2.3.2.  Anticipated Risks  
As with all injectable vaccines, immediate systemic allergic reactions , including anaphylaxis,  to 
vaccination can occur. These reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per 450,000 
vaccinations for vaccines that do not contain allergen s such as gelatin or egg protein 
CCI

Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893

 (Zent et al 2002 ). As a precautionary measure, all participants will remain under observation at the 
study site for safety monitoring for at least 30  minutes after IP injection. Vasovagal syncope 
(fainting) can occur before or after any IP injection , is usually triggered by the pain or anxiety 
caused by the injection , and is not related to the substance injected. Therefore, it is important that 
standard precautions and procedures be followed to avoid injury from fainting. Intramuscular 
vaccination commonly precipitates a t ransient and self -limiting local inflammatory reaction. This 
typically includes pain, erythema (redness), or swelling/induration (hardness) at the injection site. 
Most systemic adverse events (AEs) observed after IP injection  do not exceed mild  to moderate  
severity and are of short duration.  
In Study mRNA -1893 -P101 that tested dose levels from  to  µg, interim safety analyses after 
28 days after the last vaccination have been performed. All dose levels were generally well 
tolerated. However, there was  a trend towards more observations of local erythema and 
swelling/induration at the injection site with higher dose levels and this was evident at the  µg 
dose level, in particular after the second vaccine administration. More solicited systemic ARs wer e 
noted at the  µg dose level in terms of myalgia, fatigue, headache, chills, fever, and nausea 
with higher grade intensity. With the acknowledgment that the sample size of seropositive 
participants was very limited, the baseline flavivirus positive ser ostatus did not seem to negatively 
affect the safety profile. No serious adverse event ( SAE ) and no AE s of special interest related to 
mRNA -1893 were reported at any dose levels.  
Regarding the  µg and  µg dose levels tested in the  mRNA -1893 -P101  study , ie, the same 
dose levels planned to be tested in the Phase 2 study, t he most commonly reported solicited 
systemic adverse reactions (ARs) were: respectively for  µg and  µg, after the first vaccine 
administration, headache (21.7% and 12.5%), fatigue  (21.7% and 12.5%), myalgia (13% and 
4.2%), and nausea (8.7% and 12.5%); and after the second administration, fatigue (45.5% and 
41.7%), headache (36.4% and 37.5%), chills (22.7% and 45.8%), myalgia (18.2% and 41.7%), and 
arthralgia (18.2% and 37.5%). Feve r was reported in 4.2% of the participants at the  µg dose 
level after the first vaccine administration corresponding to a Grade 1 intensity in 1  participant, 
and in 29.2% of participants (7 cases) after the second vaccine administration; among those 7 
cases, 2 were of Grade 3 intensity. With the  µg dose level, no participant reported fever after 
the first vaccine administration and 12.6% (3 cases) reported fever of mild or moderate intensity 
after the second vaccine administration; no fever of Grade 3 was observed. As the dose levels 
selected for Study mRNA -1893 -P201 have been already tested with the same liquid formulation 
as those used in mRNA -1893 -P101, a similar safety profile as the one observed in the Phase 1 
study is anticipated.

 Laboratory ab normalities (including increases in liver enzymes and in coagulation parameters) 
following vaccine administrations were observed in clinical studies performed by the Sponsor with 
mRNA -based vaccine candidates. These abnormalities were without clinical symp toms or signs 
associated and returned toward baseline (Day  1) values over time; the clinical significance of these 
observations is unknown.  In Study mRNA -1893 -P101, inclusion criteria required that all 
participants had Grade  0 laboratory test results at en rollment. Post -vaccination laboratory 
abnormalities were infrequent, mostly Grade  1 or Grade  2, except 1 case of Grade  4 prothrombin 
test increase at Day  29 at the  µg dose level, not related to the vaccination, and further attributed 
to a laboratory tec hnical issue. None of those laboratory abnormalities were considered clinically 
relevant. Further details are provided in the current IB.  
There is a theoretical risk that active vaccination to prevent novel viral infection may cause a 
paradoxical increase  in the risk of disease. This possibility is based on the rare phenomenon of 
vaccine -associated disease enhancement, which was first seen in the 1960s with 2 vaccines made 
in the same way (formalin -inactivated whole virus) and designed to protect children against 
infection with respiratory syncytial virus ( Chin et al 1969 ) or measles ( Fulginiti et al 1967 ). 
Antibody disease enhancement has also been proposed as a possible explanation for the cases of 
more serious disease associated with dengue vaccination ( Thomas and Yoon 2019 ; WHO 2018 ); 
this phenomenon was already known in cases of a dengue reinfection caused by a heterologous 
serotype. It is not known if mRNA -1893 will increase the risk of ZIKV -enhanced disease and also 
the risk of dengue -virus –enhanced d isease because of the close relationship between dengue virus 
and ZIKV (flavivirus family, geographic location, cross -reactivity). To monitor this risk, the 
Sponsor will perform a careful safety follow -up throughout the entire study duration by 
establishin g an Oversight Safety Team (OST) and an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). The OST will perform a biweekly review of safety events in a blinded fashion. In 
addition, the DSMB will convene on an approximately quarterly basis until study end an d at any 
time if there is an ad -hoc safety concern detected by the OST. The DSMB will review unblinded 
study data to evaluate the safety findings. All AEs, SAEs, and medically attended AEs (MAAEs) 
will be reviewed in terms of frequency and severity by the board and they will be asked to provide 
recommendations and guidance as to management of safety follow -up within the study 
(Section  11.1.1 ) 
There hav e been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with 
COVID -19 mRNA vaccines. The majority of the cases have been reported in young males shortly 
after the second dose of the vaccine. The risk is highest in males under t he age of 40 years, 
specifically males between 12 through 17 years. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, 
or palpitations. Study participants should seek medical attention and also notify study site staff if

 any of these symptoms occur followin g vaccination. While some cases required intensive care 
support, available data from short -term follow -up suggest that most individuals have had 
resolution of symptoms with conservative management. It is not known whether the risk of 
myocarditis or pericar ditis is increased following additional doses of the vaccine. Investigators and 
study participants should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis 
(Gargano et al 2021 ). 
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion  
Appropriate eligibility crite ria, as well as clearly defined study procedures, are included in this 
protocol. The risk to participants in this study may be minimized by compliance with the eligibility 
criteria and study procedures.  
All safety findings will be closely monitored biweekl y by the OST and reviewed by the 
independent DSMB during periodic meetings to evaluate the safety and treatment status of all 
participants. The composition, roles, responsibilities, and governance of the OST and DSMB will 
be described in separate charters.  
Considering the safety profile observed in Study mRNA -1893 -P101 and the measures taken to 
minimize the risk to study participants, the potential risks are balanced by the anticipated benefits 
that may be afforded through vaccination with mRNA -1893.

 4. STUDY DESIGN   
4.1. General Design  
This is a Phase  2, randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled, dose confirmation study .  
All participants will be evaluated for their eligibility  (Section  4.1.1 ) for enrollment in the 
Vaccination Period and will be fo llowed for approximately 6  months (Day  196) after their last IP 
injection  (Section  4.1.2 ). Table  1 displays the Schedule of Assessments (SOA) for all participants 
through Day  196. All participants in all treatment arms will have the opportunity to continue to be 
followed as part of an approximately 2 4-month Extension Period (through Day  700) after their last 
IP injection  (Section  4.1.3 ). Table  2 displays the SOA for participants who continue into the 
Extension Period through Day  700. The study design is illustrated in Figure  1. 
A total of approximately 800 participants will be randomly assigned to receive either  µg or 
 µg mRNA -1893 administered as a 2 -dose regimen with at least a 28 -day interval between 
vaccinations (Treatment Ar m A or Treatment Arm B), or  µg mRNA -1893 administered as a 
1-dose regimen (Treatment Arm C), or placebo control administered as a 2 -dose regimen with at 
least a 28 -day interval between doses (Treatment Arm D) according to a 1:1:1:1 randomization 
ratio (ie, 200  participants per treatment arm with approximately 100 participants  per baseline 
flavivirus serostatus in each treatment arm).  Randomization was stratified by participants’ baseline 
flavivirus serostatus assessed by a rapid dengue point-of-care test on site in the original protocol 
(dated 21 Feb 2021). Under th e current protocol amendment, randomization will be stratified only 
by participants’ region ( continental US and Puerto Rico) . All treatment arms will be enrolled in 
parallel.  In order t o maintain the blinding and to have the same study evaluation time point with 
both mRNA -1893 dose regimens relative to the last IP injection , participants randomly assigned 
to Treatment Arm  C will be administered placebo at Day  1 and mRNA -1893 at Day  29 (Table  6).

 All participants will have up to 8  clinic visits (Days  0 [Eligibility Visit], 1 (baseline), 8, 29, 36, 57, 
85, and 196) and 3 safety telephone calls (Days  112, 140, and 168). Participants who continue into 
the Extension Period will have 3  additional clinic visits at Days  364, 532, and 700.  
The EOS is defined in Section  4.6. Participants who withdraw from further IP injection  for any 
reason after their first IP injection  but do not with draw consent will complete all study procedures 
through the EOS Visit ( Section  7). 
4.1.1.  Eligibility Evaluation  
Up to 8  days prior to Visit  1 (Day  1), pote ntial participants will be evaluated (interview and 
physical examination) to determine their eligibility to participate in the study according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria (Section  5.1 and Section  5.2, respectively).  The Eligibility (Day  0) 
and Baseline (Day  1) Visits may be combined on the same day.  
4.1.2.  Vaccination Period  
All participants will receive IP injection s at Visit  1 (Day  1) and Visit  3 (Day  29). Participants will 
be asked to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) to monitor solicited ARs for 6 days after each 
IP injection  (Days  1 through 7 and Days 29 through 35) and to monitor unsolicited AEs for 28 
days after each IP injection  (Days  1 through 57). Serious AEs , AESI s and MAAEs will be 
monitored from Day  1 for approximately 6  months (Visit  10 [Day  196]) after the last IP injection .  
Blood samples will be collected from all participants at Days  1 (baseline), 8, 29, 36, 57, 85, and 
196 for the assessment of antibody -mediated immunogenicity. Blood samples will be collected 
from a subset of participants (cell -mediated immunity [CMI] subset) at Days  1 (baseline), 29, 36, 
57, and 196 for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection  and assessment of cellular 
immunity. Blood samples collected from all participants at Days 85 and 196 will be used for 
detection of asymptomatic flavivirus infections.  
In case of signs or symptoms suggesting a flavivirus infection (mostly dengue and Zika in the areas 
where the study will be performed), an additional blood sample will be collected to confirm the 
diagnosis via specific s erology and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR), and 
clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case. Those 
symptoms are not specific; however, an association of acute fever onset with mac ulopapular rash, 
arthralgia, and conjunctivitis during the seasonal circulation of mosquitos must trigger samplings.  
Also, special attention will be paid to the reporting of neurological signs or symptoms evoking 
Guillain -Barré syndrome.

 4.1.3.  Extension Period  
All participants enrolled who consent to continue into the Extension Period will return to the clinic 
for follow -up visits approximately every 6  months after the last IP injection  (Days  364, 532, and 
700). Serious AEs , AESI s, and MAAEs will be monitored thr oughout the Extension Period.  
Blood samples will be collected at Days  364, 532, and 700 for the assessment of antibody -mediated 
immunogenicity . Blood samples will be collected from the CMI subset participants at Days 364, 
532, and 700 for PBMC collection  and assessment of cellular immunity. Blood samples collected 
from all participants at Days 364, 532, and 700  will be used for detection of  asymptomatic 
flavivirus infections. Additional blood samples might also be collected during unscheduled visits 
for saf ety and/or immunogenicity purposes, at the discretion of the investigator.  
As previously described in Section  4.1.2 , in case of signs or symptoms suggesting a flavivirus 
infection (mostly dengue and Zika in the areas where the study will be performed)  during the 
Extension Period, a n additional blood sample will be collected to confirm the diagnosis via specific 
serology and RT -PCR, and clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity 
of the clinical case. Also, special attention will be paid to collect signs or symptoms possibly 
related to Guillain -Barré syndrome.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
The design and dose levels proposed for this study (Study mRNA -1893 -P201) are based on 
accumulated safety and immunogenicity data from the Phase  1 Study mRNA -1893 -P101, which 
involved a total of 120  participants. Group unblinding interim analyses performed at Day  57 (ie, 
28 days after the second vaccination) showed a safety profile compatible with a large use of the 
vaccine candidate and a production of ZIKV -specific nAbs at a n SCR rangin g from 12.5% 
(2.7%  - 32.4%) to 75% (53.3%  - 90.2%) after 1 vaccine administration and from 86.4% 
(65.1%  - 97.1%) to 100% (85.8%  - 100%) after the complete 2 -dose vaccine administration.  
Study mRNA -1893 -P201 is intended to confirm the safety and immunogenic ity trends observed 
during the Phase  1 study and aims to select the dose level for the Phase  3 program. Two dose 
levels,  µg and  µg, have been chosen as they appear to give the optimal response at Day  57 
in terms of geometric mean titers ( GMTs) and S CRs with a similar safety profile. The number of 
participants (200 per treatment arm  with approximately 100 participants per baseline flavivirus 
serostatus in each treatment arm ) planned for enrollment is consistent with a Phase  2 stage clinical 
study. The  collection of solicited ARs and unsolicited AEs following vaccination is consistent with 
vaccine evaluation studies. Additionally, the 2 -year follow -up will provide long -term safety profile 
information and documentation on the duration of the ZIKV -specifi c nAb response after a 1- or 2-
dose regimen. It may also give the opportunity to evaluate occurrence of flavivirus infections,

 mostly ZIKV and dengue, as the excontinental US  sites are areas with potential for flavivirus 
circulation. The collection of bloo d at the given time points and the selection of the assays for the 
assessment of the ZIKV -specific immune response are based on experience from the preclinical 
and previous clinical studies.  
4.3. Justification for the Choice of Study Population  
It is anticipat ed that the specific immune response to a ZIKV vaccine candidate in participants who 
are baseline seronegative may be different from responses in those who are baseline seropositive 
for flavivirus. To explore the potential differences in safety and immunog enicity, this study will 
enroll healthy flavivirus -seronegative and flavivirus -seropositive participants.  
Safety and immunogenicity evaluation in adults who are flavivirus seronegative at baseline and 
the most critical at  risk population will confirm appropriateness of the dose selection in a larger 
number of participants.  
As the Phase  1 study was predominantly performed in initially flavivirus -seronegative 
participants, this Phase  2 study will expand the safety data avail able in flavivirus -seropositive 
participants, in order to have enough confidence to administer mRNA -1893 without flavivirus 
serological knowledge in the large Phase  3 studies.  
This Phase  2 study population will also target the age group in which the major ity of cases occurred 
in previous epidemics (18 to 49 years of age) and a slightly older population extending up to 
65 years, to account for the case distribution age for neurological sequalae such as Guillain -Barré 
syndrome that has been described with ZI KV. 
4.4. Justification for Dose and Schedule  
The 2 dose levels of mRNA -1893 tested in participants will be  μg and  μg based on the 
assessment of available safety and immunogenicity data from Study mRNA -1893 -P101. The 
2 dose levels will be administered as a 2-dose regimen (Treatment Arm  A and B) with at least a 
28-day interval between vaccinations that seem s to give the optimal response. In addition, the 
-µg dose will be administered as a single -dose regimen (Treatment Arm  C) to generate safety 
and immun ogenicity data that could be valuable in emergency situations, in militar y personnel  and 
traveler populations who might need a rapid response, and also in populations living in endemic 
areas and with pre -existing immune response for which 1 vaccine adminis tration might be 
sufficient.

 4.5. Justification for the Use of Placebo  
Because there are currently no licensed ZIKV vaccines available  to be used as reference vaccine, 
0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection ( United States Pharmacopeia [ USP] or British 
Pharmacopeia [ BP]) (normal saline) will be used as placebo to maintain the blinding of the study 
and to serve as a control for the safety and immunogenicity assessments.  
Moreover, to have the same study evaluation time point for primary evaluation with both 
mRNA -1893 dose regimens relative to the last IP injection , participants randomly assigned to 
Treatment Arm  C will be injected at Day  1 with placebo and will receive mRNA -1893 at Day  29 
(Table  6). 
Those participants who receive saline placebo will have the same safety follow -up as those who 
receive the 1 -dose or 2 -dose mRNA -1893 regimen (Treatment Arm A and Treatment Arm B).  
4.6. End of Study Definition  
The EOS is defined as completion of the last visit of the last participant in the study or last 
scheduled procedure as shown in Table  1 and Table  2 for the last participant in the study globally.  
Participants who do not consent to continue into the Extension Period will be considered to have 
completed th e study if they have completed the EOS Visit approximately 6 months (Visit  10 
[Day  196]) after the last IP injection . Participants who consent to continue into the Extension 
Period will be considered to have completed the study if they have completed the E OS Visit 
approximately 24 months (Day  700) after the last IP injection .

 5. STUDY POPULATION  
The study will enroll approximately 800 adult participants aged 18 through 65 years at baseline, 
including approximately 400  flavivirus -seropositive participants  and 400  flavivirus -seronegative  
participants, who will receive mRNA-1893 or pla cebo.  
A dengue rapid point -of-care test initially used to stratify study participants  has been discontinued . 
After this protocol amendment, all participants will be stratified  based on geographic region,  
assuming most of the baseline seronegatives will come from continental US sites and the baseline 
seropositives from Puerto Rico.  The confirmation will be done based on flavivirus serology testing 
(dengue immunoglobulin G [ IgG] and immunoglobulin M [ IgM], West Nile IgG and IgM)  
performed on a blood sample collected prior to administration of the first vaccination  with a goal 
of an approximately equal distribution of participants among seronegative and seropositive 
participants wi thin each treatment group . 
The planned participant distribution is presented by treatment arm in Table  7.

The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the following:  
• Supplying the IPs.  
• Confirming the appropriate labeling of IP, such that it complies with the legal requirements 
of each country where the study is to be performed.  
The investigator  is responsible for acknowledging the receipt of the IPs by a designated staff 
member at the site, including the following:  
• Confirming appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transi t for all 
IP received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the IP.

 • Ensuring that only participants enrolled in the study will receive mRNA -1893 and only 
authorized unblinded site staff will supply or administer the IP. All IPs must  be stored in a 
secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the authorized 
unblinded site staff.  
• Ensuring the appropriate dose level of mRNA -1893 is p repared using aseptic technique s 
(vaccine diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection [USP or BP] to a 
concentration for delivery of the specified dose level in a volume of 0.5 mL).  
• Maintaining IP records (ie, receipt, accountability, reconcil iation, and final disposition 
records) using the Drug Accountability Log. These logs must be available for inspection at 
any time.  
As the appearance of mRNA -1893 and placebo differs, only designated unblinded personnel 
qualified to prepare and/or administe r vaccine will be aware of the treatment assignment 
(Section  6.3.2 ). 
Further description of the IPs and instructions for the receipt, storage, prepar ation, administration, 
accountability, and destruction of the IPs is provided in the Study mRNA -1893 -P201 Pharmacy 
Manual.  
6.2.1.  Investigational Product Preparation  
mRNA -1893 will be provided as a 0.20 mg/mL dispersion in 2R glass vials labeled as required per 
country requirement. The vaccine will be diluted to a concentration for delivery of the specified 
dose level in a volume of 0.5  mL. 
6.2.2.  Investigational Product Administration  
The IP will be administered as an IM injection into the deltoid muscle, and each dose  will have a 
volume of 0.5  mL. Preferably, the first dose  should be injected into the nondominant arm and the 
second dose should be injected into the same arm as the first dose.  
The IP will be prepared for injection as a single 0.5 -mL dose for each participant based on the 
treatment arm and randomization assignment, as detailed in the Study mRNA -1893 -P201 
Pharmacy Manual. Unblinded pharmacy personnel, who will not participate in any other aspect of 
the study, will perform IP accountability, dose prep aration, and administration. The investigator  
will designate an unblinded clinical team member to provide oversight to the vaccination so that 
it proceeds according to the procedures stipulated in this study protocol and the Study 
mRNA -1893 -P201 Pharmacy M anual. Study -specific training will be provided.  

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 60 
 At each visit when IP is administered, participants will be monitored for a minimum of 30  minutes 
after IP injection. Assessments will include vital sign measurements and monitoring for immediate 
local or s ystemic reactions ( Table  1).  
Eligibility for subsequent IP injection  is determined by following the criteria outlined in 
Section  7.1.  
The study site will be appropriately staffed, and staff will be trained and experienced in delivering 
emergency  resuscitation and will have stocked rescue medicatio ns (such as epinephrine, steroids, 
antihistamines, and intravenous fluids) should any severe AR (eg,  anaphylaxis or urticaria) occur 
that requires immediate intervention.  
Further instructions for the preparation and administration of mRNA -1893 are describ ed in the 
Study mRNA -1893 -P201 Pharmacy Manual.  
6.2.3.  Investigational Product Packaging and Labeling  
All IPs used in this study will be prepared, packaged, and labeled in accordance with the standard 
operating procedures of the Sponsor or those of its designee, US Title 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR), Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines, ICH GCP guidelines, guidelines for 
Quality System Regulations, and applicable regulations.  
A 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection (USP or BP) (normal saline) for use as placebo and 
mRNA -1893 preparation will contain a commercial label and country requirements as necessary.  
6.2.4.  Investigational Product Storage  
mRNA -1893 must be stored at -25ºC to -15°C ( -13ºF to 5ºF). mRNA -1893 must be received by 
designated unblinded personnel at the study site, handled and stored safely and properly, kept in a 
secured location with restricted access (unblinded pharmacy staff only), and protected from 
moisture and light until it is prepared  for administration.  
The 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection (USP or BP) must be stored at 20 ºC to 25ºC (68ºF 
to 77ºF)  in a restricted access area (unblinded pharmacy staff only).  
6.2.5.  Investigational Product Accountability  
The unblinded  designee must maintain an accurate record of the shipment receipt, the inventory at 
the site, dispensing of study treatment, and the return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of 
used/unused products in a drug accountability log. Drug accountability will be noted by the 
unblinded clinical research associate (CRA) during site visits and at the completion of the study. 
For further direction, refer to the Study mRNA -1893 -P201 Pharmacy Manual.

Confidential  Page 61 
 6.2.6.  Investigational Product Handling and Disposal  
The designated unblinded CRA will reconcile the IP at the interim monitoring visit and at the end 
of the study for compliance. Once fully reconciled at the site, the IP can be destroyed at the 
investigational site or by a Sponsor -selected third party, as appropriate.  
The IP may be des troyed at the study site only if permitted by local regulations and authorized by 
the Sponsor. A Certificate of Destruction must be obtained and sent to the Sponsor or designee. 
For further direction refer to mRNA -1893 -201 Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3. Randomization an d Blinding  
6.3.1.  Randomization  
The randomization will be in a blinded manner using a centralized Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT), in accordance with pre -generated randomization schedules. Approximately 
800 p articipants will be randomized in parallel accord ing to a 1:1:1:1 randomization ratio to the 
4 treatment arms. Randomization was stratified by participants’ baseline flavivirus serostatus 
under the original protocol. Under this protocol amendment, randomization will be stratified only 
by participants’ re gion ( continental US and Puerto Rico).  Only the unblinded pharmacy personnel 
(Section  6.3.2 ) will have controlled access to which arm the participan t is randomly assigned.  
6.3.2.  Blinding  
This is an observer -blind study. The investigator , study staff, study participants, site monitors, and 
Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to the IP administered until the electronic data 
capture (EDC) is locked and CSR has been written, with the following exceptions:  
• Unblinded pharmacy personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to IP accountability 
procedures and will prepare and administer mRNA -1893 or placebo to all participants. 
These pharmacy p ersonnel will have no study functions other than IP management, 
documentation, accountability, preparation, and administration. They will not be involved 
in participant evaluations and will not reveal the identity of the IP to either the participant 
or the  blinded study site personnel involved in the conduct of the study unless this 
information is necessary in the case of an emergency ( Section  6.3.3 ). 
• Unblinded site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be assigned as 
the IP accountability monitors. They will have responsibilities to ensure that sites are 
following all proper IP accountability, preparation, and administration proce dures.  
• An unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the preplanned Day  57 
interim analysis (IA) ( Section  9.5). A limited number of Spon sor team members will be 

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 62 
 pre-specified to be unblinded to the IA results and will not communicate the results of 
interim analyses to the blinded investigator s, study site staff, clinical monitors, or 
participants.  
The IP assignment will be concealed by ha ving the unblinded pharmacy personnel prepare the IP 
in a secure location that is not accessible or visible to other study staff. Only delegated unblinded 
site staff will conduct the vaccination procedure. Once each vaccination is completed, only the 
blind ed study staff will perform further assessments and interact with the participants. Access to 
the randomization code will be strictly controlled at the pharmacy.  
Study site blinded staff will remain blinded to individual treatment assignments until the en d of 
the study.  
6.3.3.  Unblinding  
Except in the case of medical necessity, a participant’s treatment assignment should not be 
unblinded without the approval of the Sponsor. If a participant becomes seriously ill or pregnant 
during the study, the blind will be bro ken only if knowledge of the treatment assignment will affect 
that participant’s clinical management. In the event of a medical emergency requiring 
identification of individual treatment assignment, the investigator  will make every attempt to 
contact the S ponsor medical lead or designee to explain the need for unblinding within 24 hours 
of opening the code. The investigator  will be responsible for documenting the time, date, reason 
for unblinding, and the names of the personnel involved. The investigator  (or designee) will have 
access to unblind participants within IRT. All unblindings will be tracked via an audit trail in IRT 
and documented in the final study report.  
If unblinding should occur (by either accidental unblinding or emergency unblinding) before  
completion of the study, the investigator  must promptly contact the Sponsor and document the 
circumstances on the appropriate forms.  
The Sponsor will remain blinded to IP assignment throughout the treatment phase for each 
individual treatment arm  of the study up until each specified time point for interim analyses, as 
outlined in Section  9.5. 
6.4. Investigational Product Compliance  
All doses of IP will be administered at the study site under direct observation of unblinded 
pharmacy personnel and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs). Unblinded pharmacy personnel will confirm that the participant has recei ved the entire 
dose of IP. If a participant does not receive IP or does not receive all of the planned doses, the 
reason for the missed dose will be recorded.  

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 63 
 Participants who miss the second vaccination due to noncompliance with the visit schedule will 
still be required to follow the original visit and testing schedule as described in the protocol. Unless 
consent is withdrawn, a participant who withdraws or is withheld from receiving the second dose 
of IP will remain in the study and complete all safety a nd immunogenicity assessments required 
through the scheduled EOS.  
The study site is responsible for ensuring participants comply with the study windows allowed. If 
a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact the participant and co mplete a 
visit within the defined time window ( Table  1 and Table  2). If a participant does not complete a 
visit within the time window, that visit will be classified as a missed visit and the participant will 
continue with subsequent scheduled study visits. All safety requirements of the missed visit wi ll 
be captured and included in the subsequent visit (eg, eDiary review for reactogenicity, immune 
testing, as applicable).  
6.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Therapies  
6.5.1.  Prior Medications and Therapies  
Information about prior medications (including any p rescription or over -the-counter medications, 
vaccines, or blood products) taken by the participant within the 28  days before providing informed 
consent (or as designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirements) will be recorded in the 
participant’s eCRF.  
6.5.2.  Concomitant Medications and Therapies  
At each study visit the following concomitant medications and vaccines must be recorded in the 
eCRF:  
• All concomitant medications administered from the Eligibility Visit through 28 days after 
the last IP injection . 
• Any nonstudy vaccines administered during the period starting 28 days before the first IP 
injection  and ending at the last study visit.  
• Any concomitant medications and vaccines listed in Section  6.5.3 . 
• Any concomitant medications and vaccines relevant to an SAE /AESI or administered from 
the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through the last study visit for the treatment 
of an SAE /AESI. 
• Any antipyretic or analgesic to treat or prevent fever or pain within 7  days after IP injection , 
including day of injection.  

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 64 
 • Participants will be asked to record in the eDiary any antipyretic or analgesic taken to treat 
or prevent fever or pain withi n 7 days (including the day of injection) after IP injection . 
Reported antipyretic or analgesic medications should be recorded in the source document 
by the site staff during the post -IP injection  study visits or via other participant interactions 
(eg, tel ephone calls).  
6.5.3.  Conco mitant Medications and Vaccines that May Lead to the  Elimination of a 
Participant from Per-Protocol Analyses 
The use of the following concomitant medications and nonstudy vaccines will not require 
withdrawal of the participant from the study but may determine a participant’s evaluability in the 
Per-Protocol (PP) analyses. Analysis sets are described in Section  9.3. 
• Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the IP used 
during the study period.  
• Immunosuppressants or other immune -modifying drugs administered chronically (ie, more 
than 14  days in total) during the Vaccination Period or 60 days after the first IP injection . 
For corticosteroids, this will mean that prednisone ≥  20 mg/day or the equivalent is not 
permitted. Inhaled an d topical steroids are allowed.  
• Long -acting immune -modifying drugs administered at any time during the Vaccination 
Period or 60 days after the first IP injection  (eg, infliximab).  
• A nonstudy vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol administered during th e Vaccination 
Period through 28 days after each IP injection . 
• Immunoglobulins and/or any blood products administered up to Day  57. 
6.6. Intervention After the End of the Study  
Any SAE /AESI  and unexpected AEs occurring after the end of the study and considered t o be 
caused by the IP must be reported to the Sponsor.

 7. DELAY  OR DISCONTINUATION OF INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCT  AND  PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWAL FROM THE 
STUDY  
7.1. Criteria for Delay of Investigational Product Administration and 
Contraindication to Subsequent Administrat ions 
Prior to receiving a second vaccination, participants will be reassessed to ensure that they continue 
to meet eligibility requirements as outlined below.  
The following events in a participant constitute absolute contraindications to any further 
administration of the IP to that participant. If any of these events occur during the study, the 
participant must not receive additional doses of IP but will be enco uraged to continue study 
participation for safety through approximately 6  months following the vaccination ( Section  7.2):  
• Anaphylaxis or systemic h ypersensitivity reaction following the administration of IP.  
• Any SAE or AESI judged by investigator  or Sponsor to be related to IP. 
• Pregnancy.  
• Any clinically significant change in vital sign measurements or general condition  that, in 
the opinion of the investigator , poses an additional risk to the participant if he/she continues 
to participate in the study.  
The following events constitute contraindications to administration of IP at certain points in time, 
and if any of these events occur at the time sched uled for injection, the participant may be injected 
at a later date, within the time window specified in Table  1, or the participant may be withdrawn 
from dosing at the discretion of the investigator ( Section  7.3):  
• Acute mode rate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of injection.  
• Fever defin ed as body temperature ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) at the time of injection.  
Participants with a minor illness without fever, as assessed by the investigator , can be administered 
IP. Participants with a fever of 38.0°C (100.4°F) , or higher will be contac ted within the time 
window acceptable for participation and re -evaluated for eligibility.  
7.2. Discontinuation of Investigational Product  
A “withdraw al” from the IP refers to any participant who does not receive the vaccination 
series . The investigator  should make all efforts to ensure that the participants re main in the study 
to ensure a prop er safety follow-up and medical care if needed, and document reason for 
participant withdrawal from study injection . 

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 66 
 Information relative to premature discontinuation of the IP will be documented in the eCRF. The 
investigator  will document which of  the following reasons  was responsible for withdrawal: 
• SAE.  
• AESI . 
• AE (non -SAE).  
• Dosing error.  
• Other (specify).  
Participants who withdraw from further study injection for any reason after their first dose but do 
not withdraw consent will complete all study procedures through EOS, as outlined in Table  1. 
7.3. Participant Withdrawal from the Study  
Participants can withdraw consent and discontinue from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive.  
Participants who are withdrawn will not be replaced.  
From an analysis perspective, a “withdrawal” from the study refers to a situation wherein a 
participant does not return for the final visit foreseen in the protocol.  
All data collected until the date of withdrawal or last contact of the participant will be used for the 
analysis, including collected specimens.  
A participant is considered a “withdrawal” from the study when no study procedure has occurred, 
no follow -up has been performed, a nd no further information has been collected for that participant 
from the date of withdrawal or last contact.  
Investigators will attempt (eg, 3 documented telephone calls) to contact those participants who do 
not return for scheduled visits or follow -up. 
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator  will 
document whether the decision to withdraw a participant from the study was made by the 
participant or by the investigator , as well as which of the following possib le reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify).  
• Death.  
• Lost to follow -up (LTFU).  

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 67 
 • Physician decision (specify).  
• Pregnancy.  
• Protocol violation.  
• Study terminated by Sponsor.  
• Withdrawal of consent by participant (specify).  
• Other (specify).  
Participant s who are withdrawn from the study because of SAEs/ AESI s/AEs must be clearly 
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigator s will follow -up 
with participants who are withdrawn from the study as a result of an SAE , AESI  or AE until 
resolution of the event.  
Participants who withdraw from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and not 
tested, and the investigator  must document this in the site study records.  
If participants withdraw consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and 
continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research results that have already been collected 
for the study evaluation. All biologica l samples that have already been collected may be retained 
and analyzed at a later date (or as permitted by local regulations).  
7.4. Lost to Follow -Up 
A participant  will be considered LTFU if he/she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the  clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule, and ascertain whether the partic ipant wishes to and/or should continue in the 
study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the investigator  or designee must make every effort 
to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 documented telephone calls and, 
if necessary, a certifie d letter to the participant’s last known mailing address, or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts (eg, dates of telephone calls and registered 
letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 68 
 • Should the participant continue t o be unreachable, they will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed. The 
date of withdrawal/LTFU should be the date of last contact with the participant where 
safet y status of the participant was assessed (eg, clinic visit, telephone call).  
7.5. Circumstances to Delay or Discontinue the Study Independent of 
Investigational Product and Participant  
There are instances such as public health emergencies or natural disasters t hat may directly affect 
the initial plan for the study conduct. Those circumstances may correspond but are not limited to 
new emerging infectious diseases such as the current COVID -19 pandemic. Cognizant of the 
challenges that may arise from those situatio ns, an operational plan will be elaborated in a separate 
document describing potential repercussions, approaches to protect study participants, and factors 
to consider for decision to suspend or continue the ongoing study. This document follows FDA 
Guidanc e on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During COVID -19 Public Health 
Emergency updated on 03  Jun 2020 ( DHHS  2020 ). Refer also to Section  8.

 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES   
Study procedures and time points  are summarized in the SOAs ( Table  1 and Table  2). Protocol  
waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Adherence to the study design requirements, including 
those specified in Table  1 and Table  2, is essential and required for study conduct.  
Before performing any study procedures, al l potential participants will sign an ICF  
(Section  11.1.6 ). Potential participants will be evaluated ( interview and physical examination)  to 
determi ne their eligibility to participate in the study according to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria ( Section  5.1 and Section  5.2, respectively). All eligibility evaluations must be completed 
and re viewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. If a participant is 
not enrolled in the study, the reason for eligibility failure must be recorded. The investigator  will 
maintain a log to record details of all participants eval uated and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for failure, as applicable.  
A participant can  also be seen for an unscheduled visit at any time during the study. An 
unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, new or ongoing AEs, or a su spicion 
of a flavivirus infection. The site also has the discretion to make reminder telephone calls or send 
text messages to inform the participant about visits, review eDiary requirements, or to follow -up 
on ongoing or outstanding issues.  
In accordance w ith FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency  updated on 03  Jun 2020 ( DHHS  2020 ), investigators may 
convert study site visits to telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor . If a participant 
cannot attend a study site visit (scheduled or unscheduled) with the exception of Day 0, Day  1, and 
Day 29 Visits, a home visit is acceptable if performed by appropriately delegated study site staff 
or a home healthcare service provided by  the Sponsor. If neither a participant visit to the study site 
nor a home visit to the participant is possible (with the exception of Day 0, Day  1, and Day  29 
Visits), a safety telephone call should be performed that includes the assessments scheduled for 
the safety telephone calls scheduled on Days  112 through 168 ( Table  1). Such action should be 
taken to protect the safety and well -being of study partic ipants and clinical site staff or to comply 
with state or municipal mandates.  
8.1. Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic information (eg, sex, age, race, and ethnicity) and other baseline characteristics (eg, 
weight and height) will be rec orded on the appropriate eCRF page during the eligibility evaluation.

 The medical history of each participant will be obtained by interviewing the participant or by 
reviewing the participant ’s medical records . Any pre -existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms  
present prior to the signature of the ICF must be included on the Medical History page of the eCRF.  
8.2. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
8.2.1.  Baseline and Safety Laboratory Assessments  
There are no screening criteria based on the flavivirus serostatus , mean ing all participants are 
enrolled  regardless of serostatus . However, this baseline flavivirus status will be confirmed by 
serology testing s (dengue IgG and IgM, West Nile IgG and IgM) performed on a blood sample 
collected prior to administration of the first vaccination in order to eventually ensure that an 
approximate equal  distribution of participants among subgroups is respected  for the statistical 
analysis . 
A point -of-care urine pre gnancy test will be performed at the Eligibility Visit and before each IP 
injection  (or at any time at the discretion of the investigator) for all female participants of 
childbearing potential.  
The FSH level may be measured at the discretion of the investi gator to confirm menopausal status.  
There are no screening safety laboratory tests at the time of the eligibility evaluation of the 
participant. However, additional tests may be performed for safety reasons at any time during the 
study if determined necess ary by the investigator or required by local regulations. Specifically, if 
the participant presents with signs or symptoms evoking a flavivirus infection, standard -of-care 
tests and treatment will apply, and results will be reported in the source documents  and in the AE 
section of the eCRF.  
8.3. Immunogenicity and Efficacy Assessments  
8.3.1.  Immunogenicity Assessments  
Blood samples for analysis of the immunogenicity will be collected as described in  Table  1 and 
Table  2. On Days  1 and 29, blood samples for immunogenicity assessment will be collected 
before vaccination .  
The approximate blood volumes to be collected from each participant during the study are 
presented in Section  8.4.  
The following antibody -mediated immunogenicity assessments will be performed:  
• Serum ZIKV -specific nAb titers, as measured by PRNT assay, MN assay, and RVP assay.  
• Serum ZIKV -specific bAb concentrations, as measured by ligand binding assay.

Confidential  Page 71 
 The following CMI assessments will be performed  with the additional blood samples collected for 
PBMC isolation from the CMI subset participants ( Table  1 and Table  2): 
• Frequency of ZIKV -specific T cells, as measured by ICS assay and sequencing.  
• Frequency of ZIKV -specific B cells, as measured by ELISpot.  
• Other techniques that may be relevant to assesses the profile characteristics of the 
ZIKV -specific T - and B -cell responses may be also included.  
Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that ba ckup samples are available and that adequate 
vial volumes may allow further testing needs. The actual time and date of each sample collected 
will be recorded in the eCRF, and unique sample identification will be utilized to maintain the 
blind at the labora tory at all times and to allow for automated sample tracking and housing. 
Handling and preparation of the samples for analysis, as well as shipping and storage requirements, 
will be provided in a separate Laboratory Manual.  
Testing will be performed in lab oratories designated by the Sponsor.  
8.3.2.  Efficacy Assessments  
Blood samples for detection of asymptomatic flavivirus infection will be collected as described in  
Table  1 and Table  2. Asymptomatic flavivirus infections will be assessed through quantification 
of nonstructural protein  1-specific bAbs, as measur ed by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA).  
In case of signs or symptoms suggesting a flavivirus infection (mostly dengue and Zika in the areas 
where the study will be performed), an additional blood sample will be collected to confirm the 
diagnosis via specific serology (IgM antibody capture ELISA and virus neutralization assay) and 
RT-PCR.  
8.4. Total Blood Volume  
All samples (blood, serum , or PBMCs) must be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory 
procedures and will be processed, labeled, and stored in accordance with the instructions in the 
Laboratory Manual.  
The approximate blood volumes to be collected from each participant du ring the Vaccination 
Period and Extension Period are provided in Table  9 and Table  10, respectively.

8.5. Safety Assessme nts 
The planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in Table  1 and Table  2. 
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant:  
• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section  11.2.3 ; Appendix  2) that occur during the 7  days 
following each IP injection (ie, the day of injection and 6  subsequent days). Solicited ARs 
will be recorded daily using eDiaries ( Section  8.5.1 ). 

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 74 
 • Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28 days following each IP injection (ie, 
the day of injection and 27  subsequent days). Unsolicited AEs are A Es that are not included 
in the protocol -defined solicited ARs ( Section  11.2.3 ; Appendix  2). Unsolicited AEs will 
be captured during safety telephone  calls or at site visits  and recorded on the participant’s 
AE CRF . 
• AEs leading to discontinuation from IP and/or study participation throughout the entire 
study duration (up to Day 700).  
• MAAEs ( Section  11.2.4 ; Appendix  2) from Day  1 throughout the entire study duration (up 
to Day 700).  
• SAEs and AESI s (Section  11.2.2 ; Appendix  2) from Day  1 throughout the entire study 
duration (up to Day 700).  
• Physical examination findings ( Section  8.5.3 ). 
• Vital sign measurements ( Section  8.5.4 ). 
8.5.1.  Electronic Diary Assessments  
At the time of consent, participants must confirm they are willing to complete an eDiary using 
either an application downloaded to their smartphone or using a device that is provided at the time 
of enrollment. This study will utilize the Medidata Patient C loud Application as the eDiary. This 
application allows for real -time data collection on a fully audited and 21  CFR Part  11-compliant 
system directly from participants, ensuring that data are attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original, and accurate  at all critical collection points. As the key diary data capture is unsupervised 
in participants’ own homes, through the use of programmed data entry windows and time stamps , 
the Patient Cloud application ensures the data are collected as per the trial desi gn. By leveraging 
electronic data collection, Medidata’s Patient Cloud Application enables participants an easier way 
to collect data - seamlessly integrated into their daily routines - while similarly allowing site staff, 
contract research organizations ( CROs), and sponsors immediate access to critical data actions. 
Before enrollment on Day  1, the participant will be instructed to download the eDiary application 
or will be provided an eDiary device to record solicited ARs ( Section  11.2.3 ; Appendix  2) on 
Day 1. 
At each vaccination visit, participants will be instructed (Day  1) or reminded (Day  29) on 
thermometer usage to measure body temperature and ru ler usage to measure injection site 
erythema and swelling/induration (hardness). Oral temperature is the preferred route of 
measurement.  

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 75 
 At each vaccination visit, participants will record data into the eDiary starting at least 30  minutes 
after IP injectio n under supervision of the study site staff to ensure successful entry of assessments. 
The site staff will perform any retraining as necessary. Study participants will continue to record 
data in the eDiary after they leave the clinic, preferably in the eve ning and at the same time each 
day, on the day of injection , and for 6  days following  each injection.  
Participants will record the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section  11.2.3 ; Appendix  2) that occur on the day of 
each dose and during the 7  days after injection (ie, the day of injection and 6  subsequent 
days). Any solicited AR that is ongoing beyond Day  7 will be reco rded until it is no longer 
reported, not to exceed 28  days after each injection. Solicited ARs recorded in eDiaries 
beyond Day  7 should be reviewed by study site staff either during the next scheduled 
telephone call or at the next study site visit ( Table  1 and Table  2).  
• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the same 
time each day using the thermometer provided by the study site. If body temperature is 
taken more than o nce in a given day, only the highest temperature reading should be 
recorded.  
• Measurements, as applicable, for solicited local ARs (injection site erythema and 
swelling/induration); the size measurements will be performed using the ruler provided by 
the stu dy site.  
• All medications taken on the day of each dose and during the 28  days after injection (ie, 
the day of injection and 27  subsequent days). Participants will be queried by the eDiary 
whether any medications were taken to treat or prevent pain or fever  on a day of injection 
or for the 6  subsequent days.  
The eDiaries will be the main source documents allowed for solicited local or systemic ARs 
(including body temperature measurements). Participants will be instructed to complete eDiary 
entries daily. If assessments are not recorded for a given day, the participant will have a limited 
time window on the following day to complete qualitative assessments for the previous day, 
excluding measurements of body temperature and of any injection site erythema or 
swelling/induration. Any new safety information reported during safety telephone call s or at site 
visits (including a solicited AR) not already captured in the eDiary will be described in the source 
documents as a verbally reported event. Any solicited AR reported in this manner must be entered 
on the Reactogenicity  page of the eCRF.

 Proce dures for transferring eDiary data to the eCRF are presented in the Study mRNA -1893 -P201 
Study Manual. Study site staff will review eDiary data with participants at the Day  8 and Day  36 
Visits.  
8.5.2.  Safety Telephone Calls  
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participant by trained site personnel. This 
call will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety information. The 
participant will be interviewed according to the script, and information will be collected abou t the 
occurrence of any MAAEs, SAEs, AESI s, or AEs leading to study withdrawal, concomitant 
medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy vaccinations.  
The timing of the safety telephone calls is provided in Table  1.  
All safety information described by the participant must be documented in source documents and 
not documented on the script used for the safety telephone contact.  
8.5.3.  Physical Exam ination  
A full physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the cardiovascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems according to standard medical practice. 
Weight and height will be recorded and BMI will be calculated  (body weight [kg]  ÷ height [m]2) 
during the eligibility evaluation.  
A symptom -directed physical examination will be performed at the discretion of the investigator 
each time the participant is in the clinic when a full physical examination is not otherwise specified. 
Symptom -directed physical examinations will include, at a minimum, inspection of the general 
status of the participant, according to standard medical practice. Additional elements of the 
physical examination should be added on the basis of symptoms described during the interview of 
the participant. Prior to IP injection  and at follow -up visits, female participants should also be 
queried for new onset of menarche.  
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 
Treatment of any abnormality observed during physi cal examination should be performed 
according to local medical practice outside the study or by referral to an appropriate healthcare 
provider at the discretion of the investigator.  Any clinically significant finding identified during a 
study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
Significant new findings that begin or worsen after informed consent must be recorded on the AE 
page of the eCRF.

Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 77 
 8.5.4.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital sign measurements will include body temperature (preferred route is oral), systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. The participant will be seated for at least 
5 minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be collected prior to study procedures 
and at least 30  minutes after IP injection, prior t o discharge of the participant from the study site.  
Febrile participants at Day  1 and Day  29 Visits (fever is defined as a body temperature 
≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) may be rescheduled within the relevant window periods.  
When procedures overlap and are scheduled to occur at the same time point, the order of 
procedures should be vital sign measurements and then the blood collection.  
If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical abnormalities 
(Table  13) of Grade  3 or greater, the abnormal value and grade will be documented on the AE page 
of the eCRF (unless there is another known cause of the abnormality that would result in an AE 
classification). The investigator will continue to monitor the participant with additional 
assessments until the vital sign value has reached the reference range, returns to the vital sign value 
at baseline, is considered stable, or until the investi gator determines that follow -up is no longer 
medically necessary.  
8.6. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions and procedures for the recording, evaluation, follow -up, and reporting of AEs 
(solicited ARs, unsolicited AEs, and MAAEs) and SAEs a re presented in Appendix  2. 
Adverse events will be reported by the participant. The investigator and any qualified designees 
are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE 
or SAE and remain responsible fo r following up on AEs that are serious, considered related to the 
administration of IP or study procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the  study.  
8.6.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
Medical occurrences that begin before the first vaccination with mRNA -1893 but after obtaining 
informed consent will be recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of 
the eCRF, not in the AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time during the s tudy, 
it will be recorded and reported as an AE.  
The time periods for collection, recording, and reporting of solicited ARs, unsolicited AEs, and 
SAEs are found in Appendix  2. 
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant.  

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 78 
 • Receiving  an unsolicited complaint from the participant.  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and nonleading manner.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from the day of injection through 6 days after each IP injection  
(Days  1 through 7 and Days  29 through 35). Ot her (unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the 
day of injection through 28 days after each IP injection  (Days  1 through 29 and Days  29 through 
57). 
Serious AEs will be collected from the first IP injection until the last follow -up visit after the last 
IP injection at the time points specified in the SOAs  (Table  1 and Table  2).  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately, and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in  Section  11.2.11 . The investigator will 
submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation (eg, a radiograph,  an 
ultrasound, or an electrocardiogram) can also indicate an AE if it is determined by the investigator 
to be clinically significant (eg, leads to dose modification or study drug discontinuation or meets 
any serious criteria). If this is the case, it must  be recorded in the source document and as an AE 
on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF. The evaluation that produced the value or result should 
be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or is stabilized and the participant’s safety 
is not a t risk.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study 
participation . However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/ she considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the following contact information is to be used 
for SAE reporting:  
• SAE  Mailbox:  
• SAE Hotline (USA and Canada):  
• SAE Fax line (USA and Canada):  
8.6.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs

 Electronic diaries have specifically been designed for this study by the Sponsor.  The diaries will 
include pre -listed AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales . In addition to the eDiari es, delegated 
site staff will interview the participant to assess the occurrence of any unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and 
medications taken. The investigator or designated site staff will transcribe the collected 
information into the eCRF.  
The investigator is res ponsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of treatment group or 
suspected causal relationship to the IP. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain 
information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets the 
criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the partici pant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.6.3.  Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs (as defined in Appendix  2) will be treated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU 
(as defined in Section  7.4). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix  2. 
8.6.4.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The definition  of AESI s and reporting of AESI s is presented in Section  11.2.5  and Section  11.2.12  
(Appendix  2), respectively . Adverse events of special interest for this protocol , including 
myocarditis/pericarditis  and anaphylaxis, among others,  are listed in  Section  11.2.13  
(Appendix  2). For Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) working case definitions of 
myocarditis, pericarditis, and m yopericarditis occurring after receipt of COVID -19 mRNA 
vaccines , refer to Section  11.4 (Appendix 4 ).  
8.6.5.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities t owards the safety of participants and the safety of 
an IP under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of an IP under clinical inve stigation. The 

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 80 
 Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent 
Ethics Committees (IECs) , and investigators.  
• Investigator safety repor ts must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE /AESI or 
other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs /AESI s) from the Sponsor 
will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate, 
according to local requirements.  
8.6.6.  Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnanci es occurring in female participants after the administration of IP must be 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within 72  hours of learning of the pregnancy following the 
procedures outlined in Appendix  2. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, 
fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
Further information on the collection of pregnancy information is given in Appendix  2. 
8.7. Treatment of Overdose  
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should do the following:  
1. Contact the Medical Monitor SAE hotline immediately.  
2. Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until the last 
safety follow -up visit.  
3. Report any signs or symptoms associated with the overdose as a n AE and record details in 
the relevant AE/SAE sections in the eCRF.  
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose in the eCRF.

 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
The study objectives are presented in Section  3. 
There is no hypothesis testing in this study.  
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size for this study is not driven by statistical assumptions for formal hypothesis testing. 
This sample siz e is regarded as sufficient to provide an understanding of the safety profile of 
mRNA -1893 and to confirm the dose selection to advance development into future studies.  
Approximately 800 participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive  2 doses of 
 µg mRNA -1893 separated by 28  days (Treatment Arm  A), 2 doses of  µg mRNA -1893 
separated by 28  days (Treatment Arm  B), a single dose of  µg mRNA -1893 on Day  29 
following a single dose of placebo on Day  1 (Treatment Arm C), or 2  doses of  placebo separated 
by 28  days (Treatment Arm  D). A total of 600 participants will receive mRNA -1893, 
200 participants in each dosing arm, with approximately 100 participants in each flavivirus 
serostatus cohort and dosing arm; approximately 200 participant s will receive placebo. Table  11 
presents the 95% confidence interval (CI) for 1  participant with an AE and the lowest AE rate 
detectable with at least  95% probability for each selected sample size. The 2 -sided 95% CI was 
calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method for one proportion in SAS 9.4 software. A sample 
size of 200 (or 400) has at least a 95% probability to observe at least 1  participant with a n AE at a 
true 1. 49% (or 0.75%) AE rate.

 9.3. Populations for Analyses  
9.3.1.  Randomized Set  
The Randomized Set consists of all participants who are randomized in the study, regardless of the 
participant’s treatment status in the study. Participants  will be included in the treatment arm to 
which they are randomized.  
9.3.2.  Solicited Safety Set  
The Solicited Safety Set consists of all participants who are randomly assigned and received any 
IP and contribute any solicited AR data. The Solicited Safety Set wil l be used for the analyses of 
solicited ARs and participants will be included in the treatment arm corresponding to the IP they 
actually received.  
9.3.3.  Safety Set  
The Safety Set consists of all participants who are randomly assigned and received any IP. The 
Safety Set will be used for analysis of safety except for the solicited ARs. Participants will be 
included in the treatment arm corresponding to the IP they actually received for the analysis of 
safety data using the Safety Set.  
9.3.4.  Full Analysis Set  
The Full Ana lysis Set (FAS) consists of all participants who are randomly assigned and a) received 
any IP, b) have baseline (Day  1) data available for those analyses that require baseline data, and 
c) have at least 1  post-IP injection  assessment for the analysis endpo ints as specified in b). 
Participants will be included in the treatment arm to which they are randomly assigned.  
9.3.5.  Per-Protocol Set  
The PP set consists of all FAS participants who a) comply with the vaccination schedule, 
b) comply with the timings of immunog enicity blood sampling to have post -IP injection  results 
available for at least 1 assay component corresponding to the immunogenicity analysis objective, 
and c) have no major protocol deviations that impact immune response during the period 
corresponding to the immunogenicity analysis objective.  
The PP set will serve as the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity data in this 
study. Participants will be included in the treatment arm to which they are randomly assigned.  
9.4. Statistical Analyses

appropriate . This s ection is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and 
secondary endpoints.  
9.4.1.  Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
Demographic variables (eg, age, height, weight, and BMI) and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized by treatment arm overal l (regardless of baseline serostatus ) and by baseline flavivirus 
status  assessed by dengue and West Nile specific serologies and treatment arm using  descriptive 
statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation for continuous variable, 
and number and percentage for categorical variables).  
The treatment arms are:  
• mRNA -1893: 2  doses of  μg, separated by 28  days.  
• mRNA -1893: 2  doses  μg, separated by 28  days.

• Placebo: 2 dose s of placebo, separated by 28  days.  
9.4.2.  Efficacy Analyses  
Not applicable.  
9.4.3.  Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will include solicited ARs (local and systemic), unsolicited AEs, SAEs, AESI s, 
MAAEs, and AEs leading to vaccine/study withdrawal, and vital sign measurements.  
The intensity of solicited ARs, unsolicited AEs, and vital sign measurements will be graded as 
described in Section  11.2.8  (Appendix  2).  
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set, except analyses of solicited ARs which will be 
based on the Solicited Safety Set. All safety analyses will be provided by treatment arm overall  
(regardless of serostatus) and by baseline flavivirus status assessed by dengue and West Nile 
specific serologies , and vaccination (first, second), unless otherwise specified.  
Solicited local and systemic ARs during the 7 -day follow -up period after each IP injection  will be 
tabulated by number and percentage o f participants reporting ≥  1 event. The number and 
percentage of participants with any solicited local AR, with any solicited systemic AR, and with 
any solicited AR during the 7 -day follow -up period after each IP injection  will be provided with a 
2-sided 9 5% exact CI using the Clopper -Pearson method.

 If the number of participants in the FAS and PP set differ by m ore than 10%, supportive  
immunogenicity analyses may be conducted on the FAS.  
For the primary  and secondary  immunogenicity endpoint s, descriptive summary statistics of 
antibody -mediated immunogenicity at each time point will include GMT (for nAbs), median,  
minimum, maximum, 95% CI, and geometric mean fold  rise of post -baseline/baseline nAb titers 
with corresponding 95% CI . 
For GMT calculation s, antibody titers reported as below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 
will be replaced by 0.5  × LLOQ. Values that are greater than the upper limit of quantification 
(ULOQ) will be converted to the ULOQ.  
The number and percentage of participants with seroconversion will be provided with 2 -sided 
95% CI using Clopper -Pearson method by treatment arm overall and by baseline flavivirus 
serostatus.  
The number and percentage of participants with seroresponse will be provided with 2 -sided 
95% CI using Clopper -Pearson method by treatment arm in baseline flavivirus -seronegative 
participants.  
The number and percentage of participants with ≥ 2 or ≥ 4-fold rise in ZIKV -specific nAb titers  
will be provided with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method at each post -baseline  
timepoint.  
Seroconversion is defined as either an increase in ZIKV -specific nAb titer from below the LLOQ 
to a titer equal to or above LLOQ, or an increase of at least 4 fold in ZIKV -specific nAb titer in 
participants with pre -existing nAb titers , as measured by a specific assay /methodology . 
Seroresponse is defined as an increase in ZIKV -specific nAb titer from below the LLOQ to greater 
than or equal to the LLOQ , as measured by a specific assay/methodol ogy. 
Further details will be described in the SAP.  
9.5. Study Planned Analyses  
The following analyses will be conducted on cle aned data:  
1. An IA of safety and immunogenicity data will be performed after all participants have 
completed Day  57 (28  days after the IP injection ). The Day  57 IA will be performed by a 
separate team of unblinded programmers and statisticians. Pre -identifi ed Sponsor team 
members will be unblinded to review treatment level results, as defined in the study Data 
Blinding Plan. The unblinded statistics team will not be involved in either study design or 
the regular study conduct. The participants and study site s will remain blinded until the

Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 87 
 conclusion of the study. The IA will serve as the basis for the progression to the ZIKV 
Phase  3 studies.  
2. The final CSR will include full unblinded analyses of all safety and immunogenicity with 
individual unblinded listings through Day 196 (all data through approximately 6  months 
after the last IP injection ).  
3. An addendum to the CSR will include the safety and immunogenicity data from Month  8 
until EOS for all participants enrolled in the Extension Period.  
More details can be found in the SAP.  
In addition, unblinded data presentation or analysis for DSMB review will be handled by the 
unblinded team of statisticians and programmers, who are not involved in study design. More 
details regarding DSMB analysis can be found in the  DSMB Charter.

11.1. APPENDIX 1: Study Governance Considerations  
11.1.1.  Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following:  
• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration of Helsinki and Council for Internation al Organizations of Medical Sciences 
International Ethical Guidelines.  
• Applicable ICH GCP Guidelines.  
• Applicable laws and regulatory requirements.  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, IB, and other relevant documents (eg, 
advertisements) must be submitt ed to an IRB/IEC by the investigator and reviewed and 
approved by the IRB/IEC before the study is initiated.  
• Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB/IEC approval before implementation of 
changes made to the study design, except for changes necessar y to eliminate an immediate 
hazard to study participants.  
• The investigator will be responsible for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/IEC annually or 
more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policie s, and procedures 
established by the IRB/IEC.  
− Notifying the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by 
IRB/IEC procedures.  
− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH gui delines, the IRB/IEC, European Union regulation 
536/2014 for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable local 
regulations.  
11.1.2.  Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of the Sponsor 
or its representatives will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 92 
 • Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities o f the Sponsor or its representatives. This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor, designated 
CRO, and the investigator.  
According to ICH GCP guideline, the Sponsor of the study is responsible for ensuring the proper 
conduct o f the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded in the eCRFs. 
The study monitor’s duties are to aid the investigator and the Sponsor in the maintenance of 
complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data.  The study monitor will 
advise the investigator of the regulatory necessity for study -related monitoring, audits,  IRB/IEC  
review, and inspection by providing direct access to the source data/documents. In addition, the 
study monitor will explain to and int erpret for the investigator all regulations applicable to the 
clinical evaluation of an IP as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation throughout 
the study to protect the rights of  the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; to verify 
completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study conduct 
to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the Clinical Monitoring Plan. During the study, 
a monitor from the Sponsor or a representative will have regular contacts with the investigational 
site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investiga tional team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being performed.  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with 
the participant ’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to 
the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each participant (eg, 
clinical charts or electronic medical record system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs /AESI s have been properly documented in eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs /AESI s have been forwarded to the SAE Hotline, and those SAEs /AESI s that met 
criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB/IEC.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information 
or advice.

 11.1.3.  Audits and Inspections  
The Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB/IEC, or regulatory authorities will be allowed to conduct 
site visits to the inves tigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring or inspecting any aspect of 
the study.  The investigator agrees to allow the Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB/IEC , or 
regulatory authorities to inspect the IP storage area, IP stocks, IP records, partic ipant charts and 
study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct .  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and any IRB/IEC may visit the 
site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verificatio n. The purpose of a Sponsor 
audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed, and accurately reported accord ing to the protocol, ICH GCP E6(R2) , and any applicable 
regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact the Sponsor immediately if contacted by 
a regulatory agency about an inspection.  
The Principal Investigator must obtain IRB approval for the in vestigation. Initial IRB approval, 
and all materials approved by the IRB for this study including the participant consent form and 
recruitment materials must be maintained by the investigator and made available for inspection.  
11.1.4.  Financial Disclosure  
The investigator  is required to provide financial disclosure information to allow the Spons or to 
submit the complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements required under 21 CFR 54. 
In addition, the investigator  must provide the Spon sor with a commitment to promptly upda te this 
information if any  relevant changes occur during the course of the investigation and for 
1 year following the co mpletion of the study. 
The Sponsor, the CRO,  and the study site are not financially responsible for further testing or 
treatment of  any medical condition that may be detected during the eligibility evaluation.  In 
addition, in the absence of specific arrangements, the Sponsor, the CRO , and the study site are not 
financially responsible for fu rther treatment of the disease u nder study.

The informed consent document(s) must meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, 
ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requirements, where 
applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study center. All consent documents will be approved by the 
appropriate IRB/IEC. The actual ICF used at each center may differ, depending on local 
regulations and IEC/IRB requirement s. However, all versions must contain the standard 
information found in the sample ICF provided by the Sponsor. Any change to the content of the 
ICF must be approved by the Sponsor and the IEC/IRB prior to the form being used.   
If new information becomes a vailable that may be relevant to the participant’s willingness to 
continue participation in the study, this will be communicated to him/her in a timely manner. Such 
information will be provided via a revised ICF or an addendum to the original ICF.  
The inve stigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the participant and 
answer all questions regarding the study.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the participant fully understands the nature and 
purpose of the study . Information should be given in both oral and written form whenever possible.  
No participant should be obliged to participate in the study. Participants must be informed that 
participation is voluntary. Participants, their relatives, guardians, or (if ap plicable) legal 
representatives must be given ample opportunity to inquire about details of the study. The 
information must make clear that refusal to participate in the study or withdrawal from the study 
at any stage is without any prejudice to the partic ipant’s subsequent care.  
Participants must be allowed sufficient time to decide whether they wish to participate.  
The participant must be made aware of and give consent to direct access to his/her source medical 
records by study monitors, auditors, the I RB/IEC, and regulatory authorities. The participant 
should be informed that such access will not violate participant confidentiality or any applicable 
regulations. The participant should also be informed that he/she is authorizing such access by 
signing th e ICF.  
A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant or the participant’s legally authorized 
representative.  
The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples for 
optional exploratory research. The in vestigator or authorized designee will explain to each 
participant the objectives of the exploratory research. Participants will be told that they are free to 
refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the 
storage period. A separate signature will be required to document a participant's agreement to allow

 any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research. Participants who decline to 
participate in this optional research will not provide this separate  signature.  
At Visit  10 (Day  196), all participants will have the opportunity to provide their consent to 
participate in the Extension Period (through Day  700).  
11.1.7.  Protocol Amendments  
No change or amendment to this protocol may be made by the investigator or the Sponsor after 
the protocol has been agreed to and signed by all parties unless such change(s) or amendment(s) 
has (have) been agreed upon by the investigator or the Sponsor. Any  change agreed upon will be 
recorded in writing, and the written amendment will be signed by the investigator and the Sponsor. 
Institutional review board approval is required prior to the implementation of an amendment, 
unless overriding safety reasons war rant immediate action, in which case the IRB(s)/IEC(s)  will 
be promptly notified.  
Any modifications to the protocol or the ICF, which may impact the conduct of the study, potential 
benefit of the study, or may affect participant safety, including changes of study objectives, study 
design, participant population, sample sizes, study proc edures, or significant administrative 
aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such amendment will be released by the 
Sponsor, agreed by the investigator(s), and approved by the relevant IRB(s)/IEC(s)  prior to 
implementation. A signed and d ated statement that the protocol, any subsequent relevant amended 
documents and the ICF have been approved by relevant IRB(s)/IEC(s)  must be provided to the 
Sponsor before the study is initiated.  
Administrative changes of the protocol are minor corrections  and/or clarifications that have no 
effect on the way the study is to be conducted. These administrative changes will be released by 
the Sponsor, agreed by the investigator(s), and notified to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) . 
11.1.8.  Protocol Violations and Deviations  
The inve stigator or designee must document and explain in the participant’s source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a 
change to, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study parti cipants without prior IRB 
approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the 
reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments should be submitted to the IRB for review 
and approval, to the Sponsor for agree ment, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended or unanticipated departure from the procedures or 
processes approved by the Sponsor and the IRB and agreed to by the investigator. Deviations 
usually have  an impact on individual participants or a small group of participants and do not

Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 96 
 involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria. A protocol violation occurs when the 
participant or investigator does not adhere to the protocol, resulting in a sig nificant additional risk 
to the participant. Protocol violations can include nonadherence to inclusion or exclusion criteria, 
enrollment of the participant without prior Sponsor approval, or nonadherence to FDA regulations 
or ICH E6(R2) guidelines.  
Protoc ol violations and deviations will be documented by the clinical monitor throughout the 
course of monitoring visits. The investigator will be notified in writing by the monitor of violations 
and deviations. The IRB should be notified of all protocol violati ons and deviations, if appropriate, 
in a timely manner.  
11.1.9.  Data Protection  
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or datasets 
that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or any 
information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.  
The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of  disclosure must also be 
explained to the participant.  
The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical 
Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the Sponsor, by appropriate 
IRB/IEC membe rs, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.  
Individual participant medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered 
confidential, and disclosure to third parties is prohibited. Information will be accessible to 
authorized parties  or personnel only. Medical information may be given to the participant’s 
physician or to other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the participant’s well -being. 
Each participant will be asked to complete a form allowing the investigator to notif y the 
participant’s primary healthcare provider of his/her participation in this study.  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a 
manner desi gned to maintain participant con fidentiality. All records will be kept in a secure 
storage area with limited access. Clinical information will not be released without the written 
permission  of the participant, exce pt as necessary for monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor, 
its designee, relevant regulatory au thority, or the IRB. 
The investigator  and all employees and coworkers involved with this study may not disclose or use 
for any  purpose other than performance of the study, any data, record, or other unpublished,  
confidential information disclosed to those individuals for the purpose of the study. Prior written

 agreement from the  Spons or or its designee must be obtained for the disclosure of any confidential 
information to other parties. 
11.1.10.  Sample Retention and Future Biomedical Research  
Samples may be used for purposes related to ZIKV research, in particular assay development, 
assay validation, and animal challenge studies. There will be no human genetic testing (whole 
genome sequencing or creation of cell lines) performed on these sample s. The DNA of the CMI 
subset participants may be used to further characterize the immune response to mRNA -1893 
vaccine, but only epitopes relevant to the ZIKV -specific immune response will be investigated. 
The samples may be stored for 20 years or until th e study team has determined that specimens are 
no longer needed, per local requirements. In addition, identifiable samples can be destroyed at any 
time at the request of the participant.

 11.1.11.  Study Safety Oversight by Oversight Safety Team and Data Safety Monit oring 
Board  
Study safety will be monitored by an OST  that will include the investigators participating in the 
study and the protocol team, which will include the CRO Medical Monitor and the Sponsor 
Clinical Development Physician and may include additional  representatives from the Sponsor 
Project Team. The CRO Medical Monitor will be responsible for performing a review of the 
enrollment and study -related safety data with oversight by the Sponsor Clinical Development 
Physician. During the Vaccination Period,  a formal biweekly meeting/teleconference will be 
scheduled among the CRO Medical Monitor, the Sponsor Clinical Development Physician, and 
the Lead Investigator (or alternate investigator) to review safety events in a blinded fashion. Once 
all participants  in all treatment arms enter the Follow -Up Period, the interval of these meetings 
may be extended to monthly. This decision will be confirmed by the protocol team.  
In addition, an independent DSMB will be established for Study mRNA -1893 -P201. It will be 
composed of experts with experience in clinical development and vaccines and with expertise in 
flavivirus es. Members of the DSMB will be independent from the study conduct and free of 
conflict of interest. The DSMB will convene on an approximately quarterly  basis until study end. 
Additionally, the DSMB may convene at any time if there is an ad -hoc safety concern detected by 
the protocol team. This independent board will be informed of the progress and conduct of the 
study; their primary responsibility will b e to review unblinded study data to evaluate the safety 
findings. All AEs, SAEs, AESI s, and MAAEs will be reviewed by the board, and they will be 
asked to provide recommendations and guidance as to management of safety follow -up within the 
study. In additi on, should immunogenicity findings request further opinion, the DSMB would be 
asked to review unblinded available immunogenicity data and provide guidance.  
Details regarding the composition, responsibilities, and procedures of the OST and the DSMB will 
be presented in the OST and DSMB charters, respectively.  
11.1.12.  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data  
The Sponsor shares information about clinical studie s and results on publicly accessible websites, 
based on international and local legal and regulatory requirement s, and other clinical study  
disclosure commitments established by pharmaceutical industry associations. These websites 
include clinicaltrials.gov, European Union clinical trial register (eu.ctr), etc., as well as some 
national registries.

 In addition, resu lts from clinical studie s are required to be submitted to peer -reviewed journals 
following internal company review for accuracy, fair balance, and intellectual property. For those 
journals that request sharing of the analyzable data sets that are reported in the publication, 
interested researchers are directed to submit their request to clinicalstudydatarequest.com.  
Individual participant data and supporting clinical documents are available for request at 
clinicalstudydatarequest.com. While making informati on available the privacy of participants in 
clinical studie s sponsored by the Sponsor is assured. Details on data sharing criteria and process 
for requesting access can be found at this web address: clinicalstudydatarequest.com.  
11.1.13.  Data Quality Assurance  and Quality Control  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff at the site under the supervision of 
the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the da ta reported.  
• All participant data relating to the study will be recorded in the eCRF unless transmitted to 
the Sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The investigator is responsible 
for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically 
signing the eCRF.  
• The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the eCRF.  
• The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
• Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk -based initiatives in operations and quality 
such as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk -Based 
Monitoring), methods, responsibilities and requirements, including handling of 
noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on -site monitoring) 
are provided in the Monitoring Plan.  
• The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data m anagement of this study including 
quality checking of the data.  
• The Sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals (eg, CROs).  
• Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the eCR F by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from 
source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that

Confidential  Page 100 
 the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any 
other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
• Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must 
be retained by the investigator for 2  years after study completion unless local regulation s 
or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed 
during the retention period without the written approval of the Sponsor. No records may 
be transferred to another location or party without written notification to t he Sponsor.  
Quality assurance (QA) includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to 
ensure that the clinical study is performed and the data are generated, documented (recorded), and 
reported according to ICH GCP and local/regional r egulatory standards.  
A QA representative from the  Sponsor or its qualified designee , who is independent of and 
separated from routine monitoring, may periodically arrange inspections/audits of the clinical 
study by reviewing the data obtained and procedura l aspects. These inspections may include 
on-site inspections/audits and source data checks. Direct access to source documents is required 
for the purpose of these periodic inspections/audits.  
11.1.14.  Data Collection and Management  
This study will be conducted in  compliance with the ICH document “Guidance for Industry -
E6 (R2) Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance,” dated November 2016. This study will 
also be conducted in accordance with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
This study w ill use electronic data collection to collect data directly from the investigational site 
using eCRFs. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are 
completed promptly and correctly and that entries can be verified against  any source data.  
Study monitors will perform source document verification to identify inconsistencies between the 
eCRFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved in accordance with the principles of 
GCP. Detailed study monitoring procedures ar e provided in the Clinical Monitoring Plan.  
Adverse events will be coded according to the  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities . 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO – Drug Reference List.  
11.1.15.  Source Documents  
Source documents are origi nal documents or certified copies, and include, but are not limited to, 
diary cards, medical and hospital records, screening logs, ICFs, telephone contact logs, and 
worksheets. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 101 
 Data reported on the paper case report form or entered into the eCRF that are transcribed from 
source documents must be consistent with the source document s or the discrepancies must be 
explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, 
depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available.  
The Sponsor or its designee requires that the investigator  prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate records for each participant treated with the IP. Source documents such as any hospital, 
clinic, or office charts and the signed ICFs are to be included in the investigator’s files with the 
participant’s study re cords.  
11.1.16.  Retention of Records  
The Principal Investigator must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of at 
least 2  years after the last marketing application approval or, if not approved, 2 years following 
the discontinuance of the tes t article for investigation.] If this requirement differs from any local 
regulations, the local regulations will take precedence unless the local retention policy is less than 
2 years.  
If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor or the regulatory authority to  review any documentation 
relating to the study, the investigator must permit access to such records. No records will be 
destroyed without the written consent of the Sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
Sponsor to inform the investigator  when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
11.1.17.  Study and Site Closure  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any CRO(s) used in the stud y of the 
reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The 
investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy 
and/or follow -up. 
The Sponsor or designee reserv es the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor.  
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given i n advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the Sponsor or investigator may include but are not 
limited to:

 • Continuation of the study represents a significant medical risk to participants.  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or 
local health authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines.  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator.  
• Discontinuation of further mRNA -1893 development . 
Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all 
required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study site closure visit has been 
performed.  
11.1.18.  Publication Policy  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is foreseen, 
the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor before submission. 
This allows the Sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments.  
The Spo nsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance 
with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site dat a. In this case, a coordinating 
investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.  
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  
The clinical study plan and the results of the study will be published on www.ClinicalTrials.gov  
in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25(c). The results of and data from this study belong to the Sponsor.

 11.2. APPENDIX 2: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -Up, and Reporting  
11.2.1.  Definition of an AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward  medical  occurrence  associated  with the use of a drug in humans,  
regardless  of whether  it is considered  drug related.  
• A treatment -emergent  AE is defined  as any event  not present  before  exposure  to the IP or any 
event  already  present  that worsens  in intensity  or frequency  after exposure  to the IP. 
An AR is any AE for which  there  is a reasonable  possibility  that the IP caused  the AE (Section  11.2.3 ). 
For the purposes  of investigational  new drug safety  reporting,  “reasonable  possibility”  means  that there  
is evidence  to suggest  a causal  relationship  between  the IP and the AE.  
An unsolicited  AE is any AE reported  by the participant  that is not specified  as a solicited  AR in the 
protocol  or is specified  as a solicited  AR in the protocol  but starts  outside  the protocol -defined  
post-injection  period  for reporting  solicited  ARs (ie, for the 7 days after each IP injection).  
 
Events  Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Exacerbation  of a chronic  or intermittent  pre-existing  condition  including  either  an increase  in 
frequency  and/or  intensity  of the condition.  
• New  conditions  detected  or diagnosed  after the first dose of IP even  though  they may have  
been  present  before  the start of the study.  
 
Events  NOT  Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Medical  or surgical  procedure  (eg, endoscopy,  appendectomy):  the condition  that leads  to the 
procedure  should  be the AE. 
• Situations  in which  an untoward  medical  occurrence  did not occur  (social  and/or  convenience  
admission  to a hospital).  
 
11.2.2.  Definition of an SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (eg,  hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the Sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)):  
 

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 104 
 An SAE  is defined  as any untoward  medical  occurrence  that,  at any dose:  
a. Results  in death  
A death  that occurs  during  the study  or that comes  to the attention  of the investigator  during  the 
protocol -defined  follow -up period  must  be reported  to the Sponsor,  regardless  of whether  it is 
considered  IP related.  
b. Is life-threatening  
An AE is considered  life-threatening  if, in the view  of either  the investigator  or the Sponsor,  its 
occurrence  places  the participant  at immediate  risk of death.  It does not include  an AE that might  have  
caused  death  if it had occurred  in a more  severe  form.  
c. Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
In general,  hospitalization  indicates  that the participant  was admitted  to the hospital  or emergency  ward  
for at least one overnight  stay for observation  and/or  treatment  that would  not have  been  appropriate  in 
the physician’s  office  or outpatient  setting.  The hospital  or emergency  ward  admission  should  be 
considered  an SAE  regardless  of whether  opinions  differ  as to the necessity  of the admission.  
Complications  that occur  during  hospitalization  will be recorded  as AEs;  however,  if a 
complication/AE  prolongs  hospitalization  or otherwise  fulfills  the SAE  criteria,  the complication/AE  
will be recorded  as a separate  SAE.   
d. Results  in significant  incapacity  disability/incapacity  
• The term disability  means  a substantial  disruption  of a person’s  ability  to conduct  normal  life 
functions.  
• This definition  is not intended  to include  experiences  of relatively  minor  medical  significance  
such as uncomplicated  headache,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  influenza,  and accidental  trauma  
(eg, sprained  ankle)  that may interfere  with or prevent  everyday  life functions  but do not 
constitute  a substantial  disruption.  
e. Is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
f. Is a medically  important  event:  
• Medical  judgment  should  be exercised  in deciding  whether  SAE  reporting  is appropriate  in 
other  situations  such as important  medical  events  that may not be immediately  life-threatening  
or result  in death  or hospitalization  but may jeopardize  the participant  or may require  medical  
or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the other  outcomes  listed  in the above  definition.  
These  events  should  usually  be considered  serious.  
Examples  of such events  include  allergic  bronchospasm  requiring  intensive  treatment  in an 
emergency  room  or at home,  blood  dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result  in 
hospitalization,  or development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
 
ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 105 
 If an event meets any of the above definitions, regardless of the severity or relationship of the event 
to the study product, the event must be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section  8.6. 
11.2.3.  Definition of Solicited Adverse Reactions  
The occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms is actively solicited from the 
participant during a specified post -IP injection  period (day of injection and 6  subsequent days), 
using a pre -defined checklist in the eDiary (ie, solicited ARs; Section  8.5.1 ). 
The following local (injection site) ARs wil l be solicited: pain, erythema (redness), 
swelling/induration (hardness).  
The following systemic ARs will be solicited: headache, fatigue, myalgia (muscle aches all over 
the body), arthralgia (aching in several joints), nausea/vomiting, body temperature ( potentially 
fever), and chills.  
The study site staff will contact the participant within 24  hours of becoming aware of the event in 
case a severe (Grade  3) local or systemic AR occurs within 7  days after IP injection . 
The investigator will review, confirm,  and grade reactogenicity according to the grading scales 
presented in Table  13 (Section  11.2.8 ), Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent 
Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ). 
If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond 7  days after an injection, the participant will 
be prompted to capture the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until it is no longer 
reported, not to exceed 28  days after each injection  (Section  8.5.1 ). Solicited adverse reactions 
recorded in eDiaries beyond Day  7 should be reviewed either via telephone call ( Section  8.5.2 ) or 
at the following study visit.  
All solicited local ARs will be considered causally related to vaccination.  
Note: Any solicited AR that meets any of the following  criteria must be entered into the 
participants’ source document and must also be recorded by the study site on the Reactogenicity 
page of the participant’s  eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that results in a visit to a healthcare practitioner (MAAE; 
Section  11.2.4 ). 
• Solicited local or systemic AR that leads to the participant withdrawing from the study or 
the participant being withdrawn from the study by the Investigator (AE leading to 
withdrawal).  
• Solicited local or systemic AR lasting beyond 7 days after an injection.  

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 106 
 • Solicited local or systemic AR that leads to participant withdrawal from IP.  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE 
(Section  11.2.2 ). 
• Solicited AR with a toxicity score of Grade 3 or greater.  
11.2.4.  Definition of Medically Attended Adverse Events  
An MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to a healthcare practitioner. This would 
include visits to study site for unscheduled assessments and visits to healthcare practitioner s 
external to the study site (eg, urgent care, primary care physician ). Investigators will review 
unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAEs. Unsolicited AEs (ie, MAAEs) will be captured 
on the AE page of the eCRF .  
11.2.5.  Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor are required. Such events may require furthe r investigation to 
characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest for this protocol are listed in 
Section 11.2.13  (Appendix 2 ). 
11.2.6.  Recording and Fo llow-Up of an AE and/or SAE  
The participants will be instructed to  contact the investigator immediately should they develop any 
untoward signs or symptoms or any medical condition that leads to hospitalization or an 
emergency room visit. In addition, the s tudy site staff will contact the participant within 24  hours 
of becoming aware of the event if any of the following is reported via eDiary within 7  days after 
IP injection : severe (Grade  3) local or systemic ARs ( Table  13). 
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation 
(eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF in standard medical 
terminology, along with the date and time of onset and the date and time of resolution.  
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi es of the participant’s medical records to 
the Sponsor or designee in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE page of the eCRF.  
There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by the 
Sponsor or designee. In this case, all par ticipant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 

ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 107 
 number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to the Sponsor or 
designee.  
The investigator will attempt to establish a single diagnosis of the event based on sign s, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, 
severity, seriousness, and relatedness to mRNA -1893.  
11.2.7.  Pregnancy  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 72  hours of the site learning of its occurrence ( Section  11.3.3 ). If the participant agrees to 
submit this information, the pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth 
defects, congeni tal abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up 
should occur even if the intended duration of the safety follow -up for the study has ended. 
Pregnancy report forms will be distributed to the study site to be used for this purpose . The 
investigator must immediately (within 24  hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregnancy 
resulting in an abnormal outcome according to the procedures described for SAEs 
(Section  11.2.11 ). 
11.2.8.  Assessment of Severity  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s daily 
activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volun teers Enrolled in 
Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (DHHS  2007 ), presented in Table  13 will be used to record the 
intensity of solicited ARs and vital sign measurements observed during this study.  
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by the invest igator based 
upon medical judgment and the definitions of severity as follows:  
• Mild: These events do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities and 
require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive therapeutic 
intervention.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s source documentation 
to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. An 
AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset and duration of each episode. An

11.2.9.  Assessment of Causality  
Assessment  of Causality  
All solicited  injection  site ARs are considered  to be related  to IP. 
The investigator’s  assessment  of an AE’s  relationship  to the IP is part of the documentation  process  
but is not a factor  in determining  what  is or is not reported  in the study.  The causality  assessment  
between  the solicited  systemic  ARs/unsolicited  AEs and mRNA -1893  exposure  is one of the criteria  
used when  determining  regulatory  reporting  requirements.  For each solicited  systemic  
AR/unsolicited  AE, the investigator  will assess  causality  (ie, whether  there  is a reasonable  
possibility  that the IP caused  the event)  according  to the categories  below:   
ModernaTX, Inc.  09 Dec 2021  
Protocol: mRNA -1893 -P201, Amendment 3 mRNA -1893  
 
Confidential  Page 111 
 Not Related : There  is not a reasonable  possibility  of a relationship  to the IP. Participant  did not 
receive  the IP, or temporal  sequence  of the AE onset  relative  to administration  of the IP is not 
reasonable,  or the AE is more  likely  explained  by another  cause  than the IP. 
Related:  There  is reasonable  possibility  of a relationship  to the IP. There  is evidence  of exposure  to 
the IP. The temporal  sequence  of the AE onset  relative  to the administration  of the IP is 
reasonable.  The AE is more  likely  explained  by the IP than by another  cause.  
Assessment  of Expectedness  
• An AE or solicited  AR is considered  “unexpected”  if it is not listed  in the IB or is not listed  at 
the specificity  or severity  that has been  observed  with the vaccine  being  tested  or, if an IB is not 
required  or available,  it is not consistent  with the risk information  described  in the general  
investigational  plan or elsewhere  in the current  application.  For example,  under  this definition,  
hepatic  necrosis  would  be unexpected  (by virtue  of greater  severity)  if the IB referred  only to 
elevated  hepatic  enzymes  or hepatitis.  Similarly,  cerebral  thromboembolism  and cerebral  
vasculitis  would  be unexpected  (by virtue  of greater  specificity)  if the IB listed  only cerebral  
vascular  accidents.  “Unexpected,”  as used in this definition,  also refers  to AEs or suspected  ARs 
that are mentioned  in the IB as occurring  with a class  of drugs  or as anticipated  from  the 
pharmacological  properties  of the drug but are not specifically  mentioned  as occurring  with the 
particular  drug under  investigation.  
11.2.10.  Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs  
Follow -Up of AEs and SAEs  
• All AEs,  SAEs,  and MAAEs  must  be reported  in detail  on the appropriate  page of the eCRF  
and followed  until the event  is resolved  or stable  or judged  by the investigator  to be not 
clinically  significant.  
11.2.11.  Reporting of SAEs  
Any AE considered serious by the investigator or that meets SAE criteria ( Secti on 11.2.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE). The 
investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the SAE. The 
Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE as outlined 
in the 21 CFR Parts  312 and 320. The investigator is responsible for notifying the IRB directly.

 SAE  Reporting  to the Sponsor  or Designee  via an Electronic  Data  Collection  Tool  
• The primary  mechanism  for reporting  an SAE  to designee  will be the electronic  data collection  
tool. 
• If the electronic  system  is unavailable,  then the site will use the paper  SAE  data collection  tool 
(see next section)  in order  to report  the event  within  24 hours  of becoming  aware  of the event.  
• The site will enter  the SAE  data into the electronic  system  as soon  as it becomes  available.  
• After  the study  is completed  at a given  site, the electronic  data collection  tool will be taken  
off-line to prevent  the entry  of new data or changes  to existing  data.  
• If a site receives  a report  of a new SAE  from  a study  participant  or receives  updated  data on a 
previously  reported  SAE  after the electronic  data collection  tool has been  taken  off-line, then 
the site can report  this information  on a paper  SAE  form  (see next section)  or using  the 
following  contact  information:  
 
o SAE  Mailbox:   
o SAE  Hotline  (USA  and Canada):   
 
SAE  Reporting  to the Sponsor  or Designee  via Paper  Case  Report  Form  
• A backup  plan is used (using  a paper  SAE  form)  when  the eCRF  system  does not work  and 
should  be faxed  to the Sponsor  at:  
o SAE  Fax line (USA  and Canada):   
• In rare circumstances  and in the absence  of facsimile  equipment,  notification  by telephone  is 
acceptable  with a copy  of the SAE  data collection  tool sent by overnight  mail or courier  
service.  
• Initial  notification  via telephone  does not replace  the need  for the investigator  to complete  and 
sign the SAE  case report  form  pages  within  the designated  reporting  time frames.

 11.2.12.  Reporting of AESI s 
The process for reporting an AESI ensures compliance with 21 CFR 312 and ICH GCP guidelines.  
All AESI s will be collected through the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor or 
designee immediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event 
via the EDC system. If a site receives a report of a new AESI from a part icipant or receives updated 
information on a previously reported AESI at a time after the eCRF has been taken offline, then 
the site can report this information on a paper AESI form using the SAE Mailbox. After learning 
that a participant has experienced a n AESI, the Investigator or designee is responsible for reporting 
the AESI to the Sponsor, regardless of relationship or expectedness . If the AESI meets the criteria 
for an SAE, the SAE reporting procedure should be followed.  
11.2.13.  Adverse Events of Special Interest Terms  
Investigators should report all events that fall into the categories presented in Table 15 as an AESI 
per the reporting processes in Section 11.2.12 . These AESI s are medical concepts that are generally 
of interest in vaccine safety surveillance as per the Brighton  Collaboration and Safety Platform for 
Emergency Vaccines.

11.2.13.1.  Myocarditis /Pericarditis  
A case of suspected, probable, or confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis should 
be reported as an AESI, even if it does not meet criteria per the CDC case definition. The event 
should also be reported as an SAE if it meets seriousness criteria ( Section 11.2.2 ). The CDC case 
definition is provided in Section 11.4 (Appendix 4 ) as guidance.  
11.2.13.2.  Anap hylaxis  
All suspec ted cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as an AESI  and reported as an SAE, based 
on the criteria for a medically important event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As an 
SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediat ely and in all circumstances 
within 24  hours , per Section  11.2.11 . The Investigator will submit any updated anaphylaxis case 
data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. For reporting purposes, a participant who 
displays signs or symptoms consi stent with anaphylaxis (as described below) should be reported 
as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided as general guidance for Investigators and is 
based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition (Rüggeberg  et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an a cute hypersensitivity reaction with multi -organ system involvement that can 
present as, or rapidly progress to, a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome c haracterized by the following:  
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involves 2 or more organ systems, as follows:

 11.3. APPENDIX 3: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy 
Information  
11.3.1.  Definitions: Women of Childbearing Potential  
Females of childbearing potential are those who are considered fertile following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, 
amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle ca nnot be confirmed before first dose 
of mRNA -1893, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following categories are not considered women of childbearing potential:  
1. Premenarchal.  
2. Premenopausal,  surgically sterile female with one of the follo wing:  
a. Documented complete hysterectomy.  
b. Documented bilateral salpingectomy.  
c. Documented bilateral oophorectomy.  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, 
(eg, müllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivit y), investigator discretion should be applied to 
determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female.  
• A postme nopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. The following age -specific requirements apply:  
o Women <  50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or more follow ing cessation of exogenous hormonal 
treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and FSH levels in the 
postmenopausal range for the institution.  
o Women ≥ 50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or mo re following cessation of all exogenous 
hormonal treatments, had radiation -induced menopause with last menses >  1 year 
ago, had chemotherapy -induced menopause with last menses >  1 year ago.  
• A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confir m a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal

 replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, 
confirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status befo re study enrollment.  
11.3.2.  Contraception Guidance:  
Female participants must be nonpregnant and nonlactating and meet one of the following 
criteria:  
a. Postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for 12  consecutive months without an 
alternative medical cause or documented serum FSH level in the postmenopausal 
range);  
b. Surgically sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy).  
NOTE: Procedures and laboratory results must be confirmed in the medical record, by 
physical examination, or by official written confirmation of a procedure; or  
c. If of childbearing potential, has practiced adequate contraception or has abstained from 
all a ctivities that could result in pregnancy for at least 28 days prior to the first 
vaccination (Day  1) and agrees to consistently use a highly effective (ie, <  1% failure 
rate per year) method of contraception ( Table  16) through 3  months after the last IP 
injection . Female participants should also refrain from breastfeeding throughout this 
period.

11.3.3.  Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 24  hours of the site learning of its occurrence.  
Female Participants Who B ecome Pregnant  
• The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 72 hours of learni ng of a participant's 
pregnancy.  
• The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy (including 
spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality). 
The investigator will collect follow -up informa tion on the participant and the child, even 
if the participant is discontinued from the study, and the information will be forwarded to 
the Sponsor. Generally, follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond 
the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of 
fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication 
or elective termination of  a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous 
miscarriages, congenital anomaly, and/or birth defect abortion should be reported as SAEs.

 • Any post -study, pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably related to the mRNA -1893 
by the investigator will be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section  7.1. While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, 
he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
Any female participant who  becomes pregnant while participating in the study will discontinue 
mRNA -1893 or be withdrawn from the study.

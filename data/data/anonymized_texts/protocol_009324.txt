1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
There are over 1 million people living in the United States with spinal cord  injury (SCI) with 
devastating functional impairments including paralysis and bowel/bladder dysfunction.1   Over 
time after SCI, reorganization of the spinal reflexes occ urs and it is suspected that these 
synaptic a lterations cause detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD ). It is estimated that DSD 
occurs in 75%  of suprasacral sp inal cord  injuries with up to 50% developing seri ous urologic 
comp lications with current management strategies.2   Neuromodu lation techniques, such  as 
transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (TTNS), currently improve bladder function and reduce 
DSD in chron ic SCI, but little is known abo ut their efficacy in acute spinal cord injury.3   There is 
currently a gap in our knowledge abo ut the effects of TTNS on the bladder in acute spinal cord 
injury. We hypothesize that TTNS can  improve neur ogenic bladder parameters during acute 
SCI and that development of a feasible protocol  during ac ute rehabilitation will maintain these 
results and decrease the incidence of DSD . 
 
We believe we can  use existing TTNS technology to help neurogenic bladder in SCI.  First, we 
need to determine the safety and feasibility of a 2-week TTNS protocol in acute SCI during 
inpatient rehabilitation. Second, we will examine the effects on the bladder of this protocol as 
seen on urodynamic studies (USD ) before and after the protocol, as well as on  2-month follow- 
up. We will perform an observational study of TTNS and UDS on a ll 4 common neurologic 
categories of acute SCI admitted to TIRR Memorial Hermann and  consenting to the study. 
Patients enrolled in the study will have base line urodynamics performed, and then randomized 
to a control trial (RCT) of a 2-week protocol of TTNS to test for safety and efficacy during 
inpatient rehabilitation to evaluate bladder changes based u pon pre- and post- urodynamic 
testing, as well as 2-month follow-up.  A subset of those in the experimental TTNS group will 
also ha ve a 1-month follow-up in which they will have a maintena nce session of TTNS in clinic. 
 
We will concurrently test novel high dens ity (hd) surface electrodes during the urodynamic 
studies to see  if there is cor relation between the electrical a ctivity seen by the hd surface 
electrodes and the pressure recordings of the bladder. We believe this has the potential to 
develop into a non -invasive outcome  measure in neurogenic bladder. We will be recording 
bladder activity with high dens ity EMG surface e lectrodes during session 1, session 5,  and 
session 10. These are the same  types of electrodes used in the UDS .  Surface electrodes will 
adhere to the skin and placed abo ve and be low the pub ic bone, placed by the research 
assistant.  Recordings will last the entire stimulation sess ion. 
 
We will be looking at  urine growth factors and inflammatory markers.  These markers have 
been  investigated in patients with SCI in the past, however due to technical errors, the 
conclusions have been  withdrawn.  These technical er rors have since been co rrected  and the 
biomarkers are being utilized to cha racterize other bladder pathologies, including returning to 
look at neurogenic bladder in SCI.  They are currently being used to explore the treatment 
efficacy of BOTOX in the neurogenic bladder in SCI at TIRR, in which I am  involved as a  co- 
investigator.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   1.1. General Introduction 
 
The EMPI 300 PV a nd the newer model, the EMPI Continuum, are electric stimulation units 
used for the rehabilitation of those with paralysis.  It is currently used at TIRR Memorial 
Hermann on nearly every patient with paralysis for the purposes of motor and sens ory recovery. 
The propos ed protocol is using the device in a n ew way, to stimulate the nerves of the legs 
which is known to effect the bladder in a process described as “neuromodulation.” 
 
The status quo as  it pertains to the management of neurogenic bladder in SCI is anticholinergic 
medications to inhibit bladder activity, increase b ladder capacity, and decrease de trusor 
pressure s.4   However, management of neurogenic bladder requires further improvemen t, with 
an est imated 75% of suprasacral SCIs developing DSD and up to 50% developing serious 
urologic comp lications.2   Ongoing research regarding the neuromodu lation of chronic 
neurogenic bladder is promis ing, demonstrating equal efficacy to current management without 
non-comp liance and  adverse medication side effects, with imp roved quality of life.5-8   Although 
neuro-modulation techniques are currently used for chronic neurogenic bladder, little is little 
known abo ut the effects of neuromodu lation of the bladder in the acute phase of SCI recovery. 
The propos ed research is innovative, in our  opinion, because it represents a substantive 
departure from the status quo by  using transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation in the acutely 
injured to improve bladder function. Rehabilitation horizons for neurogenic bladder 
management which ha ve previously been unattainable through current efforts including the 
prevention of detrusor sphincter  dyssynergia and  related autonomic  dysreflexia, maintena nce of 
bladder capacity and compliance, and reduction in oral medication use with imp roved quality of 
life are also likely to become attainable. 
 
Electric stimulation is currently being us ed in acute neur orehabilitation. The cand idate has 
published reviews on the current state of acute rehabilitation in SCI, describing the use  of FES 
and NMES in acu te SCI for motor/sensory recovery, decreasing spasticity, and imp roving 
neuropathic pain.9, 10   There has been little pub lished regarding the effects of electric stimulation 
upon the bladder in acute SCI.  Sievert et  al. performed invasive sac ral neuromodulation in 
acute SCI in spinal shock (atonic bladder seen on UDS, but time from injury was not  reported), 
with the hypothesis that early intervention would prevent the development of pathologic reflexes 
leading to DSD .11   Unlike the controls that experienced the typical sequelae of SCI neurogenic 
bladder over time, including decreased bladder capacity and frequent UTIs comp licated  by 
sepsis and hosp italizations, the group  receiving the implanted neuromodulation device 
maintained normal bladder capacity, reported improved quality of life scores, and the detrusor 
did not  develop hyperactivity.11   Although the mechanism of action is unclear, it appears to be 
afferently mediated, requiring electrically induced nerve cond uction to prevent the abhorrent 
reflexes from forming which cause d etrusor overactivity and DSD.12   Less invasive, 
transc utaneous electric stimulation performed directly over the bladder for 30 sess ions over a 5 
week period in acute SCI (as early as 2 months) produced continued beneficial results based 
on UDS after 2 years.7   Based upon an extensive review of the literature on neuromodulation of 
neurogenic bladder and the clinical e xperience of our research team, we believe a TTNS 
protocol over a 2 week period will show significant improvemen ts in UDS outcomes. 
 
Concurrently, we will be testing new  hd su rface electrodes and correlate the electrical activity 
found to the pressure recordings during UDS. This harmless, non-invasive technology may 
provide a useful, quick, feasible, outcome measure in n eurogenic bladder. 
 
We will be looking at  urine growth factors and inflammatory markers to characterize neur ogenic 
bladder in SCI. They are currently being us ed to explore the treatment efficacy of BOTOX in 
the neurogenic bladder in SCI at TIR R.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   1.2. Rationale and justification for the Study 
 
We have selected  a neuromodu lation technique, TTNS, that has been used safely in chronic 
SCI with good results for improving quality of life and bladder parameters as seen on  UDS, 
specifically cystometry, and we are app lying it during the acute period during inpatient 
rehabilitation. The hypotheses a re 1) TTNS will be a s afe and  feasible modality that can be 
used during acute rehabilitation and  2) a 2-week protocol of TTNS will be an effective protocol 
to improve bladder parameters, reduce oral bladder medication usage, and reduce the 
frequency of DSD and detrusor hyperreflexia (DH) at 2-month follow-up UDS . 
 
High dens ity surface electrodes are currently being studied in the bladder of animal models. 
There is a  wealth of data recorded from the electrical acti vity of the bladder and the pelvic 
muscles. The hypothesis is that there will be a correlation between UDS outcomes and the 
high definition surface electrode recordings that may allow its use as a non-invasive, novel, and 
feasible outcome measure. 
 
Studies ha ve sho wn that cytokines and chemokines responsible for autocrine, paracrine and 
endocrine signalling are also released by  non-immune cells in the bladder such as urothelium 
and detrusor cells. [Bouchelouche et a l, 2004; Bouchelouche et  al, 2006a; Bouchelouche et al, 
2006b]  The urinary bladder relies on  a broad  array of cytokines, ch emokines and growth 
factors to effect biochemical ch anges within its organ in response to disease and  therapeutic 
intervention.  But not all these ch emokines/cytokines and growth factors can ser ve as urinary 
biomarkers or surrogates of treatment response as they have to fulfil the key requirement of 
being present in detectable amounts in urine that can be  assayed us ing standard method s. 
 
The detectable amount of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the NGB patients comb ined with its 
known role in ne uroimmune interactions makes NGF an ideal ca ndidate for a urinary biomarker. 
It has been proposed that after neurologic injury, the bladder releases NGF into the urine in 
response to the injury.  NGF and  its receptors may also amplify other immunoinflammatory and 
neuronal p athways contributing to bladder inflammation and  symptoms associated with UTI. 
 
Other proteins have been co nsistently detected  in the urine of subjects with SCI or other 
neurological d iseases like MS or impairments like diabetes.  The ch emokines and cytokines 
include: interleukin IL-5, IL-6, IL-1Ra, sIL-2R, CC chemokines including MCP-1, MIP-1 β, 
RAN TES(Regulated upon Activation, Normal T Expressed and S ecreted), CXC chemokines 
including GRO-α/ CXCL1, IL-8,  and IP-10 and growth factors including vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF- 
AA), VEGF, and  PDGF.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   a. Rationale for the Study Purpose 
 
Neuromodu lation techniques ha ve been s afely used for improving neurogenic bladder in 
chron ic SCI for many years.  However, bladder neuromodu lation is rarely performed in acute 
SCI, and it is not common in ac ute rehabilitation. There has  been little published regarding the 
effects of electric stimulation upon  the bladder in acute SCI.  Sievert et al. performed invasive 
sacral n euromodu lation in acu te SCI in spinal shock (atonic bladder seen on UDS , but time 
from injury was not reported), with the hypothesis that early intervention would prevent the 
development of pathologic reflexes leading to DSD .11   Unlike the controls that experienced the 
typical se quelae of SCI neurogenic bladder over time, including decreased bladder capacity 
and frequent UTIs complicated by sepsis and hospitalizations, the group  receiving the 
implanted neuromodu lation device maintained normal bladder capacity, reported improved 
quality of life scores, and the detrusor did not develop hyperactivity.11   Although the mechanism 
of action is unclear, it appears to be afferently mediated, requiring electrically induced nerve 
conduction to prevent the abh orrent reflexes from forming which cause  DH and DSD.14   Less 
invasive, transcutaneous electric stimulation performed directly over the bladder for 30 sessions 
over a 5 week period in acute SCI (as early as 2 months) produced continued ben eficial results 
based on UDS after 2 years.7 
 
Gaps in the knowledge which we intend to fill are: 
1) Safety and feasibility of TTNS in acute SCI during inpatient rehabilitation 
2) Efficacy of a 2-week TTNS protocol  in SCI based on UDS findings on 2-month follow-up. 
3) Analysis of bladder medication usage in those with and without TTNS, frequency of DSD , 
and evaluation of morbidity at 2-month follow-up 
 
The rationale for the use  of the hdEMG electrodes is to attempt to develop a no vel outcome 
measure for neurogenic bladder that is practical, feasible, and non -invasive. 
 
 
b. Rationale for Doses Selected 
 
Based upon an  extensive review of the literature on neuromodulation of neurogenic bladder and 
the clinical e xperience of the mentorship team, we believe a TTNS protocol over a 2 week 
period will show significant improvemen ts in UDS outcomes. Tibial nerve stimulation protoco ls 
use su bmotor current intensity with a duration of 200 µs and frequency of 10Hz.13,14   Increas ing 
the treatment frequency dramatically shortens the time required for response while maintaining 
efficacy, varying from 6-12 sess ions.14 
 
c. Rationale for Study Population 
 
Participants will include 4 groups of acute tSCI ages 18-65, 10 in each  group, based on the 
common neurologic categories of spinal cord injury: 
- Tetraplegia, comp lete 
- Tetraplegia, incomplete 
- Paraplegia, complete 
- Paraplegia, incomplete 
 
The age range for this study was se lected  because age-related changes that may alter the 
urodynamic studies in adults increas es over the age of 65.15 Consecutive patients meeting the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria a dmitted to inpatient rehabilitation for tSCI will be asked to enroll. 
There are approximately 200 acu te tSCI patients admitted to our institution ann ually, the 
majority of which sa tisfy the inclusion criteria. The distribution of the 4 neurologic classifications 
required is similar to the published data from the Model Systems.16   Inclusion criteria include 
IRB Page 10 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   ages 18-65 years old admitted to inpatient rehabilitation within 6 weeks of injury with a 
neurologic level of injury rostral to T10 (T9 and above).  This is a significant neurologic level 
because the bladder remains innervated at these levels, without damage to the spinal cord 
neurons  innervating the bladder. The RCT is 10 sessions over 2 weeks, thus discharge within 
2 weeks is undesirable. Because o ur institution serves a large geographic region, routinely 
providing care to five different s tates, the ability to return to outpatient clinic for follow-up is 
considered inclusion criteria. Although there is no clear definition of “acute” SCI, most studies 
range from 2- 14 weeks post injury.15-19   The European Multicenter Study about Spinal Cord 
Injury has published a time schedule for the stages of SCI, in which our time frame would be 
considered ac ute.17   The 6 week time period was chosen as  the upper limit to ensure 
recruitment of patients within the time frame of the grant period. We anticipate most subject 
recruitment within 4 weeks of injury given cu rrent admission trends. 
 
d. Rationale for Study Design 
 
Specific Aim 1:  Safety and feasibility of TTNS in acute SCI during acu te rehabilitation.  This 
has been demonstrated in chronic SCI. 
Specific Aim 2.1:  2-week RCT of TTNS to compare UDS outcomes to controls on 2-month 
follow-up. 
Specific Aim 2.2:  Those that receive a T TNS maintena nce dose 1 month after discharge will 
have better urodynamic outcomes than both the control and those in the TTNS that did not 
receive the maintena nce dose. 
 
 
2. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES 
 
 
 
2.1. Hypothesis 
 
Hypothesis 1: TTNS will be a s afe and  feasible modality that can  be us ed in acute tSCI 
patients during inpatient rehabilitation. They will have non-significant differences in  morbidity, 
mortality, and functional outcome  measures  during their admission compared to controls. 
 
Hypothesis 2.1: Those that receive TTNS will show significant improvements in bladder 
parameters on post-UDS comp ared to both baseline UDS and the co ntrol group. 
Improvemen ts may be seen in the following UDS parameters: 
- volume at first involuntary detrusor contraction 
- maximum detrusor pres sure (cmH20) 
- bladder capacity (maximum volume infused) 
- frequency of detrusor sphincter  dyssynergia 
 
Hypothesis 2.2:  On 2-month follow-up, those that received TTNS will have sus tained bladder 
improvemen ts compared to control with less occurrence of DSD on UDS .  Those that receive a 
maintena nce dose of TTNS will have better urodynamics than those that did not. 
 
 
 
2.2. Primary Objectives 
 
Primary Objective 1:  Monitor for safety of a 2 week TTNS protocol in acute SCI. 
Primary Objective 2:  Compare  the effects upon the bladder of a 2-week TTNS protocol  in 
acute SCI versus  control group upon completion of the TTNS protocol with UDS as well as on  
2-month follow-up UDS . 
IRB Page 11 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   2.3. Secondary Objectives 
 
Secondary Objective 1:  Identify the neurologic bladder category of acute SCI based on 
baseline UDS in which TTNS is effective.  Subjects will be s tratified into the randomized trial 
based on areflexic bladder versus  not-areflexic bladder. 
 
Secondary Objective 2: Identify the effects of a maintena nce dose of TTNS one month after 
comp letion of the 2 week trial. 
 
Secondary Objective 3: Compare  the findings of hdEMG surface electrodes abo ve the pubic 
bone to the urodynamic study findings of the detrusor. 
 
Secondary Objective 4: Characterize other bladder pathologies, including neurogenic bladder 
in SCI, by analysing urine growth factors and inflammatory markers. 
 
 
 
2.4. Potent ial Risks and  Benefits: 
 
a. End Points - Efficacy 
 
Specific Aim 1: No efficacy requirement for the safety and feasibility studied in spec ific aim 1. 
 
Specific Aim 2:  Upon completion of the randomized co ntrol trial, we expect to observe 
significant improvemen ts in UDS measures  comparing base line to post- UDS in the TTNS 
group and  at the 2-month follow-up.  The UDS outcome measures we expect  to improve are: 
 
- Increase  in bladder capacity by 50% or 100ml 13 
- Increase  in volume at first detrusor contraction by  50% or 100ml 13 
- Decrease in  maximum detrusor pressure by 25% 18 
 
We also expect to see decreased  frequency of DSD in those that received TTNS compared to 
the Control group.  We do not e xpect beneficial UDS changes in the Control group  
 
Anticipated benefits include improved bladder capacity, decreased detrusor pressure, 
decreased d etrusor-sphincter d yssynergia, improved morbidity, and decreased bladder 
medication usage. 
 
b. End Points - Safety 
 
We expect the rates of morbidity to be the same between those who participate and  those who 
do not in both Aims of the research. Risks can be divided into the risks involved in having 
urodynamic studies and the risk of having electric stimulation. 
 
Urodynamic Study Risks: 
Some complications of urodynamic cystometry may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
- Urinary Tract infections (UTIs) 
- Autonomic D ysreflexia (symptoms of increased  adrena line response which may 
include increase blood pressure, headache, sweating, and flushing). 
 
UTIs are a risk any time a foreign object is introduced into the urethra and or bladder. To 
mitigate this risk, skilled urology nurses will be us ing sterile technique to insert the catheters. 
 
Autonomic D ysreflexia (AD) is a unique phenomenon which occu rs when there is an  injury or 
IRB Page 12 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   lesion between the sa crum (bottom) and the pons (top) within the sp inal cord. It may occur in 
any SCI with a neurologic level of T6 (middle spine) and above.  It occ urs whenever there is a 
noxious stimulus be low the neurologic level of injury, with a mounting stress response that may 
cause elevated blood pressures, sweating, flushing, and/or headaches. In this setting, the 
distention of the bladder during the study and/or the cath eter insertion/placement  may be the 
noxious factor. To mitigate AD: 
- Filling rate will be 4 0ml/min, rather than 50ml/min. 
- Blood pressure will be monitored every 3-5 minutes.  An elevated SBP >20mmgHG 
from baseline indicates  AD. 
- Staff will be monitoring for sweating, flushing, and asking about headaches du ring 
the study. 
- Should the patient have AD, we will stop filling for 5 minutes, reposition the patient 
and/or cath eter as needed, and examine for any other noxious stimuli. 
- After 5 minutes, we will resume the filling at 20ml/min. 
- Should the AD persist, the study will stop and we will follow the AD protocol, which 
includes che cking BP every 3-5 minutes, loosening clothes, sitting the patient up, 
emptying the bladder, examining the patient for impacted bowel, and examining the skin 
for lesions.  Should the protocol  fail in lowering the BP a nd the patient requires 
medication management to lower the BP, a code will be ca lled to better address  the 
situation. 
 
It is not routine to perform UDS acutely due to evolving bladder reflexes. However, it is 
possible to perform UDS during the acute phase of injury.  Bellucci et  al. successfully performed 
UDS on 60 ac ute SCI patients with injuries less than 40 d ays prior to the study, without reported 
morbidity secondary to the UDS .19 
 
Electric Stimulation Risks: 
Electric stimulation is commonly performed on  the extremities of those with spinal cord  injury at 
the study institution. There are few adverse reactions to electric stimulation. The common 
ones include: 
- Pain with electric stimulation:  in these cases, the intens ity is reduced until it is 
comfortable. 
- Skin irritation: it is common for redness to occur on the skin at the site of the surface 
electrode. This typically dissipates within an hour of removing the electrode.  In some 
cases, the redness remains the next day.  In these case s, they are likely sensitive to the 
adhesive used and a  hypoallergenic skin electrode will be us ed.

2-month follow-up UDS . 
 
 Blinded randomized co ntrol trial of patients admitted to TIRR with acute SCI who meet I/E 
criteria a nd conse nt to participate in the study divided into three arms: 
o TTNS group:  10 sessions over a 2 week period of TTNS for 30 minutes, with 
electrode placement a nd settings as in SA 1. Current intens ity may vary from patient 
to patient and will be d ocumen ted and used in the analysis.  The current intens ity 
per patient will remain the same and should it need to be lowered,  it will be recorded 
and add ed to the ana lysis. 
o Control group: control ankle stimulation, 5 sessions per week for 2 weeks, for a total 
of 10 sessions. Control ankle stimulation will be performed identical to the TTNS 
group, but after the intensity is set, it will be d ecreased a bruptly to off. 
 Pain sco res on the visual analog sca le will be recorded b efore stimulation is started, during, 
and after. This will be recorded for analysis.


 
UDS pro tocol: 
The UDS is performed in the proced ure suite at TIRR Memorial Hermann, where nursing staff 
and technicians routinely perform this study on spinal cord  injury patients.  Briefly: 
o Sterile technique is used to empty the bladder with a lubricated catheter that inserts 
into the urethra and enters the bladder. 
o When the bladder is empty, sterile technique is used to insert lubricated catheters 
with pressure sensors through the urethra into the bladder and into the rectum while 
the patient is supine on  the proced ure table. 
o Surface EMG electrodes are placed on the perineal are  to record the muscle activity 
of the pelvic muscles and viscera,  including the internal urethral sp hincter. 
o Infusion of warm sa line into the bladder at a rate of 40ml/min begins the UDS, while 
the computer records the activity of the bladder. Measurements include the 
pressure  of the bladder and the abdominal pressure, as well the ca pacity and 
comp liance of the bladder. 
o The conclusion of the study occurs when bladder capacity is reached and the 
bladder will be em ptied. 
o Overall, the UDS will be performed following the guidelines of good urodynamic 
practices from the International Continence Society.22 
o During the UDS , we will concurrently test novel high density (hd) surface electrodes 
to see  if there is correlation between the electrical activity seen by the hd  surface 
electrodes and the pressure recordings of the bladder. 
 The surface e lectrodes will be p laced externally above the bladder, below the 
navel. 
 
TTNS protoco l: electrodes 2 inch by 4 inch will be p laced acco rding to anatomic l andmarks, 
with the negative electrode behind the internal malleolus and the positive electrode 10cm 
superior to the negative electrode, verified with rhythmic  flexion of the toes secondary to 
stimulation of the flexor digitorum and hallicus b revis.  The intens ity level will be set to the 
amper age immediately under the thresho ld for motor co ntraction.  If there is not contraction 
seen, maximal tolerable intens ity will be us ed. In addition, if the patient perceives pa in, the 
intens ity will be lowered until comfortable.  Stimulation frequency of 10 Hz and pulse width 
of 200ms in continuous mode will be us ed.13, 14 
Recording of the bladder acti vity with high density EMG surface electrodes will occur during 
session 1,  session 5, and sess ion 10. These are the same  types of electrodes used in the 
UDS .  Surface electrodes will adhere to the skin and placed abo ve and below the pubic 
bone, placed by the research assistant.  Recordings will last the entire stimulation sess ion. 
 
 Information gathered: 
o Clinical d emographics and Neurologic Exam findings from interview with patients 
and EMR review. 
o Morbidity information from clinical findings and EMR review. 
o Urodynamic findings will be retrieved from the report generated from the 
urodynamics machine. 
o TTNS intensity will be recorded  for each patient.  Pain sco res will be co llected  during 
the randomized co ntrol trial. 
o Skin examination where the electrodes were placed will be p erformed before and 
after each trial. 
o Information will be tabulated on an Excel spread sheet on my personal work desktop, 
password protected. No paper data will be retained.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   5.1. Summary  of Study Design 
 
In Specific Aim 1, we will monitor for safety and feasibility of TTNS during acute inpatient 
rehabilitation of SCI. In Specific Aim 2, the efficacy of TTNS will be s tudied by  randomizing into 
2 groups in a 2:1 ratio of TTNS:control.  Control will be receiving brief ankle stimulation that will 
be turned off after the maximal intens ity is found. After 2 weeks of stimulation, the RCT will 
have completed.  Half of those in  the TTNS group will be randomized to receive one  
maintena nce dose of TTNS in the clinic.  All those that participate will have UDS to measure 
outcomes at 2 months in clinic. 
 
 
6. METHODS AND ASSESSMENTS 
 
a. Urodynamic Studies will be performed per protocol described abo ve.  Data from the 
study is generated on  a graph and  printed. The pertinent values will be a dded to the 
data spreadsheet and the pap er will be d iscarde d. 
b. Physical exam will be p erformed per usual care at TIR R, by the attending SCI 
physicians.  Data will be retrieved from the electronic medical record and placed into the 
data spreadsheet.  Missing data will be requested from the attending physician or  
directly from the patient. 
c. Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TTNS) will be p laced daily by trained research 
assistants.  Electrodes will be removed after the 30 minute session is completed.  Pain 
scores  will be co llected  before, during, and after the TTNS sess ion.  Skin inspection will 
be performed before and after each stimulation session at  the electrode sites. 
d. Bladder activity will be recorded at session 1, 5 and 10 lasting the whole stimulation 
session of all groups using the same  type of electrodes used in the UDS placed below 
and abo ve the pubic bone. 
e. Urinary levels of NGF, cytokines and chemokines will be measured  at baseline, 
discharge and follow-up appointment. Urine will be collected  by sterile catheter or clean 
catch  midstream (CCMS) voided spec imen. Specimens will be processed  at the time of 
collection, de-identified with an untraceable number. 
 
6.2. Randomization and Blinding 
 
a. Blinding: The P.I. will be b linded to the study allocation groups. Trained research 
assistants will apply the electrodes and collect the data during the 30  minute sessions. 
b. Randomization:  After consent and the baseline UDS, subjects will be ass igned a 
number which will have already been designated as co ntrol or experimental group.  
Stratification will occ ur based on the UDS findings of areflexia versus  no areflexia. The 
PI will be blinded to this randomization.  The research assistant will have access  to this 
file. Unplanned breaking of randomization will occur should rates of morbidity 
significantly increas e.  If breaking of randomization is required, the research ass istant 
will provide the randomization file to the PI. 
 
6.3. Contraception and Pregnancy Testing 
 
For females of childbearing age included in the trial, pregnancy testing is typically performed 
prior to their admission to TIRR, available in the EMR or in the provided charting.  Patient 
contraception is not applicable in ac ute spinal cord injury as the normal menstrual cycle is 
impaired in the ac ute setting and the study will be performed while the patient is admitted to 
inpatient rehabilitation.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   6.4. Study Visits and Procedures 
 
- Screening Visits and Procedures 
 
Screening will be p erformed upon admission to inpatient rehabilitation via EMR. If there is 
missing information to complete the screen, it will be requested from the attending physician. 
 
Those that meet the I/E criteria will be a pproach ed by the PI or research assistant and asked 
for informed consent. They will have 1 day, if needed, to dec ide.  If the subject decides to 
participate, they will be scheduled for the baseline UDS in the following days and a urine 
samp le will be co llected. .  
 
- Study Visits and Procedures 
 
The baseline UDS will be sch eduled by  our therapy scheduling team and the UDS proced ure 
suite will be p repared to accept the patient.  Patients and the PI will be b linded to the 
randomization. Both groups will have the electric stimulation electrodes placed on their legs and 
the experimental group will have 30 minutes of the stimulation, with the parameters entered by 
the research assistant. This will occur for 10 sessions within a 2 week period. 
 
Bladder activity will be recorded at session 1, 5 and 10 lasting the whole stimulation session of 
all groups using the same type of electrodes used in the UDS by placing them below and abo ve 
the pubic bone. 
 
Upon completion of the RCT, patients will be sch eduled for a post-UDS . This will be s imilar to 
the baseline study. A second urine sample will be co llected  upon discharge. 
 
Patients will then be scheduled for a discharge follow-up appointment that is estimated to be at 
2 months. They will be given the Voiding Journal to fill in daily on d ischarge until their follow-up 
appointment.  Some will be randomized to the maintena nce group, 1 month after comp letion of 
the RCT. They will come  to clinic and have the TTNS applied by  the research assistant. The PI 
will con tinue to remain blinded. A third and  final urine samp le will be co llected  during the 
followup appointment for all group s. 
 
- Final Study Visit: 
 
The final study visit is the 2-month follow-up, in which the patients typically see their attending 
physician.  The 2-month UDS will be sch eduled for the same date.  Subjects will perform UDS 
as in the post-UDS . The Voiding Journal will be reviewed with the patient and collected. 
Missing information will be asked of the patient. 
 
As this UDS is part of the standard care at TIRR Memorial Hermann, recommendations on the 
management of neurogenic bladder will be given by  the PI based on  this study and recorded in 
the EMR.  This includes presc riptions for bladder medications, as needed. 
 
- Post Study Follow up a nd Proced ures 
 
The data will be s tatistically analysed in the post-study follow up. Subject participation is not 
required.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   - Discontinuation Visit and Procedures 
 
If withdrawal occ urs, no evaluation will be required for the final study visit, regardless of the 
withdrawal reason. There are no safety risks in withdrawing from this study at any point. 
 
 
 
7. TRIAL MATERIALS 
 
The electric stimulation device used for TTNS is the Empi Continuum. The control is the Empi 
Continuum with the stimulation intensity set to zero. Low-binding plastic containers will be us ed 
for handling and storing urine.  Urine will be pro cessed via protocol  for frozen and preserved 
spec imen. The use of ethanol, betamercaptoethanol, and centrifugation will be us ed to process 
the urine for storage. 
 
 
 
7.1. Trial Product (s) 
 
The Empi Continuum is a multifunction electrotherapy device cu rrently used at TIRR Memorial 
Hermann for the purpose of motor and sensory recovery in peo ple with paralysis. It has the 
ability to provide co nventional neuromuscular electric stimulation (NMES), transcutane ous 
electric nerve stimulation (TENS) and Pulsed Galvanic Stimulation electrotherapy.  The device 
has wide-ranging capability and programmability, with stimulation and wave p arameters 
adjusted  for the propos ed study purpose. The FDA Approved indications for the Empi 
Continuum are: 
 
As an NMES device, indications are for the following co nditions: 
• Retarding or preventing disuse atrophy 
• Maintaining or increasing range of motion 
• Re-educating muscles 
• Relaxation of muscle spasms 
• Increasing local blood circulation 
• Pre vention of venous thrombos is of the calf muscles im mediately after 
surgery 
 
As a TENS device, indications are for the following cond itions: 
• Symptomatic relief and management of chron ic, intractab le pain 
• Adjunctive treatment for post-surgical a nd post-trauma acute pain 
• Relief of pain assoc iated with arthritis 
 
As a Pulsed Current device, indications are for the following conditions: 
• Reduction of edema (under negative electrode) 
• Reduction of muscle spasm 
• Influencing local b lood circulation (under negative electrode) 
• Retardation or prevention of disuse atrophy

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   The high density surface EMG device has  been evaluated by  the FDA and has been found to 
be su bstantially equivalent to other medical d evices used in  people. FDA letter has been 
attached. 
 
7.2. Storage and  Drug Accountability 
 
There are no special storage needs for the device. They will be s tored in the locked office of the 
PI in a dry, dedicated place. Urine samples will either be frozen or  refrigerated and stored on 
site until shipped to the lab. 
 
 
 
8. TREATMENT 
 
8.1. Rationale for Selection of Dose 
 
Bladder neuromodulation in ac ute rehabilitation is not c ommon.  Neuromodulation of the 
detrusor has been successfully performed as early as 2 months after injury with transcutane ous 
surface electrodes applied directly over the bladder.7  Thirty session of electric stimulation over 
a 5 week period sustained significant improvements in UDS measures at 2 years.7   Invasive 
sacral n euromodu lation has also been  successfully performed early in spinal cord  injury, while 
the bladder is atonic, with ben eficial UDS outcomes.11   Neuromodulation outcomes are typically 
measured  after weeks of stimulation, however improvemen ts in bladder parameters seen on 
UDS can be se en on initial electric stimulation of the tibial nerve.13  Stimulation frequency of 10 
Hz and pulse width of 200ms in continuous mode will be us ed.13,14 
 
The 2 week period for the randomized co ntrol trial was chosen b ecause it is feasible to perform 
during inpatient rehabilitation.  Neuromodulation of the bladder has been shown to be effective 
after 6-8 sessions, with sess ions performed once weekly over 12 weeks or 3 times weekly.14 
The 30 minute stimulation sess ion is commonly used for bladder neuromodulation.23, 24

NA 
 
8.4. Specific Restrictions / Requirements 
 
Participants in the randomized co ntrol trial will be restricted from using any other form of electric 
stimulation in the lower extremiti es until the post-UDS is comp leted. 
 
8.5. Blinding 
 
Study participants will be blinded to the stimulation parameters of the TTNS.  The research 
assistant will apply the electrodes and the PI will be b linded the stimulation setting as  well. 
Unblinding is expected to occur after the 2 month follow up, at which po int both subject and PI 
will be made aware of their group assignment. 
 
Early unblinding will occur in the case of adverse events, including adverse events unrelated to 
the research. The attending physician will be made aware of the group in which the patient was 
IRB Page 20 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   included. 
 
8.6. Concomitant therapy  
 
Medications that may have an effect upon the bladder will be recorded.  The medication classes 
include: 1) bladder medications, 2)anti-spasm medications, 3) anti-depressants/anxiolytics; 4) 
neuropath ic pain medications. 
 
 
 
9. SAFETY MEASUREMENTS 
 
9.1. Definitions 
 
An adverse event is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or proced ure that may or may not be considered 
related to the medical treatment or procedure. 
 
The FDA definition of unanticipated adverse device effect will be us ed, as followed: An 
unanticipated adverse device effect as defined by FDA regulations at 2CFR 8 12.3(s) – Any 
serious ad verse effect on hea lth or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not pre viously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or  application (including a 
supplemen tary plan or  application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with 
a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
 
Skin irritation, inflammation, and electrode burn beneath the electrodes are potential adverse 
events directly related to the use  of electric stimulation. 
 
 
 
9.2. Collecting, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
The Investigator will be responsible for collecting and reporting adverse events during the UDS. 
The research assistant and the PI will collect adverse events related to the randomized co ntrol 
trial. 
 
Grading of the severity of the adverse events will be made by the PI, using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 developed by the National Cancer Instiute. The 
relevant “Burn” category is included below. 
 
 
 
Reporting procedures for: 
   Deaths and  life threatening events 
   other SAEs 
   Other adverse events 
 
The PI will report prob lems accord ing to the UTHSC-Houston IRB policy, specifically in the 
event which in the opinion of the PI is both une xpected and related and places subjects or 
IRB Page 21 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   others at risk of harm. 
 
The PI will report the reportable events to CPH S via iRIS within 7 days, unless the report 
involves the death of a participant, in which case  the report needs to be provided to CPHS 
within 24 hours. 
 
9.3. Safety Monitoring Plan 
 
The Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for the research study includes periodic statistical 
analysis on rates of morbidity of study participants compared to controls by the PI and the 
statistician.  Because of the rolling recruitment in the propos ed protocol, we anticipate the 
number of recruited individuals will be suf ficient for morbidity review quarterly. 
 
Specifically, we will focus on the occurrence of UTI. We hypothesize that the rate of UTIs in 
TTNS group will be similar to the co ntrol group. Based on literature, the rate of UTIs ranges 
from 20% to 50% in acute SCI patients, plus the addition of the incidence of UTI post UDS in 
acute SCI may be nearly 16%.  As a result, we will stop the study if there is evidence to supp ort 
UTI rate more than 40% in the TTNS group. The stopping rules are based on exact lower 95% 
Blyth-Still-Casella con fidence bou nds.  If the number of cases of UTI exceed the specified 
stopping rules: ≥ 8 UTIs in 10 patients, ≥ 13 UTIs in 20 patients, ≥ 18 UTIs in 30 patients, ≥ 23 
UTIs in 40 patients, then patient accrual will be p aused pen ding a review by the Safety 
Monitoring Committee. 
 
 
10. DATA ANALYSIS 
 
10.1. Data Quality Assurance 
 
The PI will be solely responsible for the accuracy of the data.  Single data entry will be 
performed with plans to check 10% of primary variables as  a quality control.  Single data entry 
error rates are slightly higher than 0.5% when performed by trained staff and the minimally 
improved er ror rate through double data entry is outweighed by substantial cost  savings for 
single data entry.25 Data anomalies will be reviewed by  the PI and clarification and/or correction 
will be p erformed. Incomplete entries will be reviewed and corrected if information is available. 
 
10.2. Data Entry and Storage  
 
Data will be e ntered on a spreads heet file located  on the TIRR Memorial Hermann password- 
protected desktop computer of the PI located in a locked office in  TIRR Memorial Hermann. 
After data from reports generated from the UDS are entered into the spreadsheet, they will be 
filed in a study binder in a locked drawer in the office of the PI with HIP PA information removed. 
 
5 years after manuscri pt publication, the paper reports will be p laced into the shredd er bins for 
destruction. 
 
 
 
11. SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
11.1. Determination of Sample Size 
 
Our working hypothesis is that responders to TTNS would increase bladder capacity 100ml or 
50%, which requires n=60.  Sample size cons ideration was based on  the working hypothesis 
with at least 80% power to detect an effect size of 1.0, regarding increased  bladder capacity 
IRB Page 22 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   and volume of first involuntary detrusor contraction with TTNS. These values were estimated 
based on  the findings of Amarenco et  al. and Chartier-Kastler et al.13, 18   With an effect size of 
1.0, this samp le would result in a power of 88.3%.  Power analysis was pe rformed using the 
Proc Po wer in SAS with the paired sample t-test under assumed pairwise co rrelation of 0.5. 
 
11.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans 
 
The primary outcome measures for SA 1 are markers of morbidity between the control and 
experimental groups. This includes differences  in rates of infections, skin irritation, urgent 
transfers, and pain scores. For these comparisons, the analysis will use a  propo rtion test or 
generalized linear models. 
 
The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test or paired t-test (for continuous measures) a nd 
McNemar  test (for discrete measures) will be us ed to comp are data as two samples come from 
the same subject.  Multivariate ana lysis will be c onsidered when patients’ clinical variables are 
included as a  confounding factor.  If significant differences are found, then we will use p ost-hoc 
analyses us ing ANOVA to compare each of the primary end points. We will also cond uct 
pairwise co mparisons to identify which pa irs of the study arms have different mean outcomes. 
 
The primary outcome measures for SA 2 are the changes in the UDS parameters after 2 weeks 
of TTNS versus  sham stimulation, with UDS performed at the end of the 2-week trial and again 
on follow-up in 2 months, which will use a s imilar statistical a pproach  as in SA 1.  When the 
study concerns  multiple comparis ons among four groups, the Bonferroni method  will be us ed to 
ensure that the overall type I e rror remains be low 0.05.  A p-value of <0.05 is considered 
statistically significant.  All statistic al analysis will be co nducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc. Cary, NC). 
 
The secondary outcome measures  include ana lyses of the differences  amongst the 2 groups of 
neurogenic bladder in SCI according to baseline UDS . This will be a nalyzed with generalized 
mixed models (GMMs) which can  also afford a multivariate ana lysis to account for potential 
confounders.26   To correct potential se lection bias by response, the analysis will be 
supplemen ted by weighted estimating approach.27 
 
12. ETHICAL CON SIDERATIONS 
 
12.1. Informed C onsent 
 
The PI will obtain informed co nsent from subjects meeting I/E criteria, within 1 week of their 
admission to TIRR Memorial Hermann.  Subjects will have 1 day to dec ide whether they want to 
participate. 
IRB-approved study participation material will be pro vided to the subjects. 
Non-English spe akers will be e xcluded. 
 
12.2. IRB review 
 
This protocol a nd the associated informed consent documents have been  submitted to the IRB 
for review and appro val, pending. 
 
12.3. Confidentiality of Data and Patient Records 
 
All patient records  will remain confidential. Data with Protected health Information (PHI) will be 
de-identified and given a number assignment found on  the Linking Log. The Linking Log is a 
separate file in a  separate folder found on the PI’s desktop computer. 
IRB Page 23 of 24 NUMBER:  HSC -MS-15-0806  Protocol Number, Version No. 5 and 8/29/2016.  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/04/2016   Reports generated from the UDS will be d e-identified and placed in a binder, stored in a locked 
drawer in the office of the PI. 
 
 
 
 
 
13. PUB LICATIONS 
 
We anticipate pub lication in a peer-reviewed journal within 2 years of beginning this study 
describing the effects of TTNS in acute SCI upon the bladder. Upon completion of the study in 
year 3, we anticipate publication of another manuscript within the year to descri be the outcomes 
at 2 months. 
 
 
14. RETENTION OF TRIAL DOC UMENTS 
 
All records for all participants including CRFs and  source documentation will be retained by the 
PI in a binder locked in his office, and on his desktop computer locked in his office. IRB and 
regulatory records  will be p laced in a  binder along with the mentioned documents and will be 
retained by the PI in his office at TIRR Memorial Hermann, locked in a cabinet.

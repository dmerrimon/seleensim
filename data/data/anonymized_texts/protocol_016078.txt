Study Title  
A Phase I, Single-Dose, Randomized, Partially Double- Blind, Placebo- And 
Positive -Controlled, 3-Way Crossover Study to Evaluate the Effect of LOXO 305 on QTc 
Interval in Healthy Subjects  
Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a supratherapeutic  dose of 
LOXO-305 on the QTc int erval corrected for heart rate  (HR)  compared with placebo in 
healthy subjects.  
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• to assess the effect of a single supratherapeutic dose exposure of LOXO -305 on other 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (HR, PR, and QRS intervals) and on T- wave 
morphology changes compared with placebo in healthy subjects.  
• to demonstrate assay sensitivity of the study to detect a small QTc effect using 
400 mg oral moxifloxacin as a positive control in healthy subjects.  
• to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single supratherapeutic dose of 
LOXO-305 in healthy subjects.  
• to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single supratherapeutic dose of LOXO -305 
in healthy subjects.  
Study Design  
This is a single -dose, randomized, partially double- blind (for LOXO -305 only, not 
moxifloxacin), placebo- and positive- controlled, 3-way crossover design study.  
All subjects will participate in 3 treatment periods (Treatment Periods 1, 2, and 3); in each 
treatment period, subjects will receive eithe r a single oral dose of 900 mg LOXO-305 
(Treatment A), a single oral dose of 900 mg LOXO-305 matched placebo  (Treatment B), or a 
single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin (Treatment C). All subjects will receive Treatments A, B, and C on 1 occasion during the study. There will be a washout period of at least 10 days between dosing in each period. 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences (eg, ABC), according to the 
randomization scheme generated by Covance. A total of 30 subjects will be randomized, such that 5 subjects will be assigned to each treatment sequence.  
Each treatment (A, B, and C)  will be administered orally in the mornings of Day 1, Day 12, 
and Day 23 following a fast of at least 8 hours prior to and 6 hours after dosing. Blood samples for the analysis of plasma concentrations of LOXO -305 will be collected for 
96 hours after administration of LOXO-305 (Treatment A) and LOXO-305 matched placebo 
(Treatment B), and for  (Treatment C). 
Additional blood samples will be collected for 96 hours after administration of LOXO-305

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 7 of 79 (Treatment A) and LOXO -305 matched placebo (Treatment B) and will be stored for future 
potential and/or exploratory analysis. 
Blood s amples from Treatment A will be analyzed for concentrations of LOXO-305 in 
plasma through 96 hours after administration of LOXO-305. Blood s amples from Treatment 
B will be analyzed for concentrations of LOXO-305 in plasma only at the single timepoint 
taken 2 hours after administration of  LOXO-305 matched placebo . Blood s amples from 
Treatment C will be analyzed for concentrations of moxifloxacin in plasma  
 Cardiodynamic sampling will be obtained for 24 hours 
after administration of each  dose in all treatments (A, B, and C).  
To assess their eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28  days 
(Days  -29 to - 2) and be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day  -1 (Check- in). 
Subjects will be confined a t the CRU from the time of Check -in (Day  -1) until End of 
Treatment (EOT) on Day  33 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early 
Termination (ET) if the subject discontinues. Subjects will be dosed on Day 1, Day 12, and Day 23. A follow-up phone call will occur for all subjects who received at least 1  dose of 
study drug (including subjects who are terminated early) 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET.  
The start of the study is defined as the date the first subject who is enrolled in the study signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Note that enrolled subjects are defined as those subjects who are assigned to receive a dose of study drug; this definition excludes screen failure subjects.  Replacement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary by the Sponsor. 
In this study, physical examinations, standard safety 12- lead ECGs, vital sign measurements, 
How Do You Feel? (HDYF?) inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation parameters, hematology panel, urinalysis (UA; Appendix 2), and recording of concomitant medications will be performed at specified times during the study (for specific timepoints and details on each study variable, refer to Appendix 4). Adverse e vents (AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS], or until ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call) are to be reported.  
Study completion is defined as the time of the last subject’s follow-up phone call. 
Number of Subjects  
A total of up to 30 subjects (5 subjects per treatment sequence) will be enrolled  to ensure at 
least 24 evaluable subjects completed all three treatment periods of the study. A sample size

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 8 of 79 of 24 evaluable subjects will provide at least 90% power to exclude tha t LOXO-305 causes 
more than a 10- msec QTc effect at clinically relevant plasma levels, as shown by the upper 
bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval of the model -predicted QTc effect 
(placebo- corrected change from baseline (ΔΔ) QTc [ ∆∆QTc ]) at the obs erved geometric 
mean  maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) of LOXO-305 in the study. This 
power is estimated approximately using a paired t- test. The calculation assumes a 1 -sided 5% 
significance level, a small underlying effect of LOXO -305 of 3 msec, and a standard 
deviation (SD) of the change from baseline (Δ)  QTc (ΔQTc ) of 8  msec for both LOXO-305 
and placebo.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 9 of 79 Criteria for Evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples for the analysis of concentrations of LOXO -305 in plasma will be collected 
for 96 hours after administration of LOXO -305 (Treatment A) and LOXO-305 matched 
placebo (Treatment B) . Blood samples for analysis of concentrations of moxifloxacin in 
plasma will be collected  for  (Treatment C). 
Additional blood samples will be collected for 96 hours after administration of LOXO-305 
(Treatment A) and LOXO -305 matched placebo (Treatment B) and will be stored for future 
potential and/or exploratory analysis. Blood s amples from Treatment A will be analyzed for concentrations of LOXO -305 in 
plasma through 96 hours after administration of LOXO-305. Blood s amples from Treatment 
B will be analyzed for concentrations of LOXO-305 in plasma only at the single timepoint 
taken 2 hours after administration of LOXO -305 matched placebo . Blood s amples from 
Treatment C will be analyzed for concentrations of moxifloxacin in plasma through  
  
The following PK parameters will be calculated, whenever possible, based on the plasma concentrations of LOXO- 305 (as appropriate): area under the concentration- time curve 
(AUC) from hour 0 to 24 hours postdose (AUC
0-24), AUC from hour 0 to the last measurable 
concent ration (AUC 0-t), AUC from hour 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf), percentage 
extrapolation for AUC 0-inf (%AUC extrap), C max, time to Cmax (tmax), apparent terminal 
elimination rate constant (λ Z), apparent systemic clearance (CL/F), apparent plasma termi nal 
elimination half -life (t ½), mean residence time (MRT), and apparent volume of distribution 
(Vz/F).  
Cardiodynamic: 
Cardiodynamic sampling will be obtained for 1.5 hours prior to dosing and 24 hours after 
administration of each dose in all treatments (A , B, and C). 
Safety:  
Safety will be monitored with HDYF?  inquiries, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign 
measurements, standard safety 12 -lead ECGs, and physical examinations. 
Statistical Methods  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number, arithmetic mean, SD, coefficient of variation [CV%], geometric mean, geometric CV%, median, minimum, and maximum). No formal statistical analysis is planned. 
Cardiodynamic: 
The primary QTc analysis will be based on concentration-QTc modeling of the relationship 
between the plasma concentrations of LOXO-305 and change- from -baseline QTc using

substantial HR effect is observed . The intent is to exclude an effect of placebo -corrected 
ΔQTc (ΔΔQTc) >  10 msec at clinically relevant plasma levels. If a substantial HR effect (ie, 
the largest least squares mean ∆∆HR > 10 bpm in the by-time point analysis) is observed, the 
QT interval will be corrected using several methods (QTcF, individualized heart 
rate-corrected QT interval [QTcS ], and optimized heart rate -corrected QT interval [QTcI ]) 
and the primary endpoint will be ΔQTc with the method that removes the heart rate 
dependency of QTc in the best way. Placebo -corrected ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS and ∆ QTc (ΔΔHR, 
ΔΔPR, ΔΔQRS and ∆∆ QTc) will also be evaluated at each post -dosing timepoint ('by 
timepoint ' analysis). An analysis of categorical outliers will also be performed as secondary 
analyses for changes in HR, PR, QRS, QTc, T-wave morphology and U- wave presence.  
Safety:  
All safety assessments, including AEs, SAEs, vital sign measurements, clinical lab oratory 
results, physical examination results, concomitant medications, and standard safety 12- lead 
ECGs, will be tabulated, and summarized where possible, using descriptive methodology by 
treatment and, as needed, by timepoint. Unless otherwise specified, baseline value is defined as the last non -missing measurement before administration of study drug on Days 1, 12, and 
23. No formal statistical analyses are planned for the safety data. All safety data will be listed by subject. 
The specific procedures will be documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed information concerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event (AE) profile 
of the investigational medicinal product, LOXO-305.1  
1.1. Background 
LOXO-305 (also known as LY3527727) is a selective inhibitor of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase ( BTK) being developed by Loxo Oncology. LOXO-305 is distinct from the approved 
BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib) in several important ways including on the basis of its selectivity, favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties, and non-covalent binding mode.
2 These features enable LOXO -305 to 
achieve pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures that exceed the BTK concentration resulting in 90% inhibition (IC
90) at trough, and thus deliver tonic BTK target inhibition throughout the dosing 
period, regardless of the intrinsic rate of BTK turnover. Moreover, the non-covalent binding mode of LOXO-305 is unaffected by BTK C481 substitutions, a common mechanism of drug resistance described for all available covalent inhibitors.
3,4,5,6,7 Finally, LOXO-305 is also a 
highly selective molecule that is more than 300-fold more selective for BTK versus 370 other kinases tested with no significant inhibition of non-kinase off- targets at 1 µM, thus limiting 
the potential for off-target mediated toxicities. Collectively, these unique properties of LOXO-305 are expected to deliver more potent, continuous, and selective inhibition of BTK in a variety of settings, potentially resulting in increased efficacy. Of note, the activity of LOXO-305 in diverse preclinical model systems supports this underlying hypothesis.
2 
LOXO-305 is a small molecule that was designed to block the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the BTK kinase competitively. There is no evidence of irreversible binding. LOXO-305 has a molecular weight of approximately 500 g/mol. LOXO -305 will be supplied 
as an immediate -release tablet containing 25 mg or 100 mg of drug substance. 
1.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology Summary  
LOXO-305 had high permeability in vitro, but low aqueous solubility. To reduce the 
variability in oral absorption, a spray -dried dispersion (SDD) tablet formulation was 
developed that showed consistent oral bioavailability of approximately 50% in rats and 80% 
in dogs. The bioavailability of the SDD formulation was also not dependent on feeding state in dogs. 
As is common in rodents, oral exposure of LOXO-305 was consistently much higher in 
female rats than in males given the same dose of LOXO -305. The sex difference was also 
apparent after intravenous (IV) administration of LOXO -305. There was no difference in the 
PK of LOXO-305 between sexes of dog, and none is expected in other non- rodent species, 
including humans.  
The volume of distribution (V
z) of LOXO-305 ranged from approximately 2 L/kg in the dog 
to 5 L/kg in the male rat, which indicates that LOXO -305 distributes into tissues. LOXO-305 
had protein binding of approximately 95% in human plasma. A somewhat lower extent of 
binding (approximately 82% to 92%) was observed across mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 18 of 79 LOXO-305 was metabolized slowly by human microsomal fractions and hepatocytes. The 
low rates of metabolism in both these human in vitro systems suggest that LOXO- 305 will 
have low clearance in humans. In vitro data with clone expressed cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 
enzymes and human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4 is the primary CYP enzyme that metabolizes LOXO -305. It is also a substrate for direct glucuronidation. 
In long-term hepatocyte incubations, LOXO-305 was metabolized by both oxidation and glucuronidation. Inhibition of oxidative metabolism by addition of the P450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole showed that oxidative metabolism is CYP dependent. All metabolites formed by human hepatocytes were also formed in rat and/or dog hepatocytes supporting the use of rat and dog for nonclinical safety assessment.  
Renal clearance of LOXO -305 in male and female rats was negligible. No data on renal 
clearance are available in other species; however, the renal excretion pathway is often conserved across specie s, and therefore no renal clearance would be expected in humans. 
In a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in vitro assay for human ether-à-go-go- related gene 
(hERG) activity, the concentration resulting in 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
50) for the 
inhibitory effects of LOXO -305 on hERG potassium currents was  μM, which is 
approximately  higher than the maximum unbound concentration of LOXO-305 in patients treated with the dose of 200 mg once daily (QD). There were no LOXO-305- related 
changes in any cardiovascular endpoints including QTc at single doses up to 60 mg/kg in the GLP cardiovascular study in the conscious telemetry -instrumented dog. The maximum 
observed plasma concentration (C
max) for this dose was 10000 ng/mL, which is 
approximately above the predi cted C max  ng/mL) at the proposed clinical 
therapeutic dose of 200 mg QD. Furthermore, there were no LOXO-305- related 
abnormalities in rhythm or waveform morphology in the GLP 28- day repeated -dose toxicity 
study in dogs at the low and mid-dose groups based on comparison of predose and postdose electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. The high dose (90/60 mg/kg/dose twice daily [BID]) 
was not evaluated as animals in this group were moribund/debilitated and were terminated on Day 13. Mean QTc interval was sta tistically significantly prolonged (+ 6%; + 15  msec) on 
Day 26 of the dosing phase in males administered 30/10 mg/kg/dose BID compared with controls. The prolongation in QTc for males was below the 10% increase or the threshold reported for canines exposed  to therapeutic concentrations of drugs known to cause QT 
prolongation in humans.
8 Therefore, the QTc changes were considered physiologically 
unimportant, and thus not deemed to be adverse. Together, these data indicate that 
LOXO-305 has a low risk of inducing delayed ventricular repolarization, prolongation of the QTc interval, and unstable arrhythmias in pat ients.  
There were no LOXO -305-related findings on the central nervous system when evaluated in 
rat functional observational battery tests and locomotor activity assessments after 4 weeks of dosing or during recovery at doses of up to 500 mg/kg/dose BID in male rats and 175 mg/kg/dose BID in female rats as part of the GLP 28-day repeat- dose study.  
LOXO-305 had no effect on respiration rate in the dog at doses up to 10 mg/kg/dose BID.  
Targets of toxicity were characterized in repeated -dose studies conducted in 2 relevant 
toxicity species. Certain targets (the hematopoietic and lymphoid systems) were found in both the rat and the dog. Rat- specific changes in the pancreas are species -specific and seen

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 19 of 79 with other BTK inhibitors. Dog-specific changes in lung and large intestine were lesions 
contributing to moribundity in high-dose animals in the 28-day study. Doses evaluated in the 28-day dog study demonstrated a steep dose-response curve for toxicity and pronounced changes in hematologic parameters at high exposures. Additionally, in dogs treated for 3 months, 2 male dogs at 5 mg/kg BID (the highest dose tested) were observed to have eye lesions via both ophthalmic and microscopic examination. Findings were observed in both eyes of these animals and consisted of very slight to slight multifocal or focal areas of corneal 
opacity in the center of the cornea along with constellation histopathological findings suggestive of minimal to mild corneal injury. The time of onset of these effects is unknown, as ophthalmic exams were only performed prior to the start of dosing and during the last week of the study; however, no eye effects were observed in the previous 28-day study. No ocular findings were observed in females. See the IB for additional details.

LOXO- 305 was not mutagenic in 2 bacterial reverse mutation assays and was negative in a 
non-GLP micronucleus assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells. LOXO -305 was positive for 
the induction of micronuclei via an ane ugenic mechanism in the absence and presence of the 
exogenous metabolic activation system in a GLP in vitro micronucleus assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, LOXO-305 was negative in a GLP in vivo micronucleus assay in rats at doses up to and including a dose of  mg/kg. The C
max at the 
no observed effect level of  mg/kg was  ng/mL for males and  ng/mL for females.  
LOXO-305 was not found to be phototoxic when evaluated in an in vitro neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay. 
1.3. Potential for Drug -drug Interactions 
LOXO-305 showed no detectable inhibition (IC
50 > ) of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, and weak inhibition of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 in human 
liver microsomes. After pre -incubation of microsomes with LOXO-305 and nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate prior to addition of CYP450 probe substrate, the CYP3A4 inhibitory potency of LOXO-305 was increased, suggesting the potential for time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Further kinetic evaluation confirmed t hat LOXO-305 is a 
time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
In an in vitro hepatocyte assay, LOXO-305 induced messenger RNA (mRNA) for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19. For both CYP2B6 and CYP2C19, an increase in activity was seen. For CYP3A4, LOXO-305 did not cause an increase in activity, likely due to concurrent inhibition of CYP3A4 by LOXO-305. LOXO- 305 caused a decrease in mRNA for 
CYP1A2 but did not lead to a reduction of CYP1A2 activity. In the study, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9 mRNA were not induced. 
In vitro LOXO-305 inhibited P-glycoprotein (P- gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) 1, and MATE2K. LOXO-305 did not inhibit 
organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and weakly inhibited organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, OAT3, and bile salt exporter pump (BSEP).  
LOXO-305 is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. It is not a substrate of the hepatic transporters OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or BSEP.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 20 of 79 1.4. Summary of Clinical Experience  
LOXO-305 is currently being studied in an ongoing global Phase 1/2 first- in-human study, 
LOXO- BTK -18001 (the BRUIN Study), in patients with previously treated chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphom a. The 
starting dose of LOXO-305 was 25 mg QD.  
As of September 27, 2020, safety data were available from a total of 330 patients treated in 
the LOXO- BTK-18001 study. This includes 324 patients treated at doses ranging from 25 mg 
QD to  300 mg QD in Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, and 6 patients treated in Phase 1b 
Combination Arm A (LOXO-305 200 mg QD plus venetoclax 400 mg QD [after ramp -up] 
Section  1.4.1).  
As of September 30, 2020, PK data were available from 181 patients enrolled in the LOXO- BTK -18001 study ( Section  1.4.2).  
As of November 23, 2020, LOXO-305 had been recently investigated in 1 study in healthy volunteers (LOXO- BTK -20014), which was completed. LOXO- BTK-20014 was a pilot 
food-effect crossover study evaluating the effects of food and a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) on the PK of LOXO-305 where 10 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of 
LOXO-305 on 3 separate days, each followed by a washout period.  
As of No vember 23, 2020, four additional studies were ongoing in healthy volunteers 
(LOXO- BTK-20006, LOXO- BTK-20017, LOXO- BTK-20007, and LOXO- BTK-20008).  
LOXO- BTK -20006 is a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor (itracona zole) and a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) on the PK of 
LOXO-305 where, at the time of this protocol’s development, 3 healthy volunteers were 
given 1 dose of 200 mg of LOXO -305, 12 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of 
LOXO-305 on 2 separate days (1 of which was co -administered with itraconazole), each 
followed by a washout period, and 12 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg of LOXO -305 
on 3 separate days (2 of which were co-administered with rifampin), each followed by a washout period.  
LOXO- BTK -20017 is a single ascending dose (SAD) study evaluating the safety and 
tolerability of LOXO -305 at 300 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, and 900 mg doses , where, at the time 
of this protocol’s development, 6 healthy volunteers were given a single dose of 300 mg 
LOXO-305, 6 healthy volunteers were given a single dose of 600 mg LOXO -305, 6 healthy 
volunteers were given a single dose of 800 mg LOXO-305, and 6 healthy volunteers were 
given a single dose of 900 mg LOXO -305.  
LOXO- BTK -20007 is a 2-part study of the absorption, metabolism, excretion, and the 
absolute bioavailability of [
14C]-LOXO-305 where, at the time of this protocol’s 
development, 4 subjects were given a single oral dose of 200 mg of [14C]-LOXO-305 
(containing ~200 µCi) as an oral solution and 5 subjects were given a single oral dose of 200 mg LOXO -305 as 2 × 100- mg tablets followed 2  hours later by a single dose of < 100 µg 
of [
14C]-LOXO-305 (containing ~1  µCi of radioactivity [microtracer]) administered as an IV 
push over approximately 2 minutes.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 21 of 79 LOXO- BTK -20008 is a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effects of LOXO-305 on 
the PK of a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate (midazolam) where, at the time of this protocol’s 
development, 15 healthy volunteers were given 200 mg QD of LOXO-305 on 13 consecutive 
days (1 day of which was co -administered  with IV midazolam and 1 day of which was 
co-administered  with oral midazolam).  
1.4.1. Safety  
As of September 27, 2020, 330 patients were treated in the LOXO- BTK-18001 study and 
received LOXO -305. This includes 324 patients treated at doses ranging from 25 mg QD to 
300 mg QD in Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, and 6 patients treated in Phase 1b Combination Arm A (LOXO-305 20 0 mg QD plus venetoclax 400 mg  QD [after venetoclax 
ramp -up]). A full summary of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for patients in the 
study is provided in the LOXO-305 IB and the Investigator is directed to the safety information described in that document.
1 A summary of safety for LOXO -305 given as 
monotherapy to patients in the LOXO- BTK-18001 study is provided below.  
• In the 324 patients in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, TEAEs reported in ≥  10% 
of patients (n = 33 or more) were fatigue (20.1% total, 8.3% related), diarrhea (17.0% total, 8.6% related), and contusion (13.0% total, 9.0% related). Drug -related TEAEs 
were reported in 156 of 324 patients (48.1%) in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts. 
The most frequently reported drug- related TEAEs for LOXO -305 (those in >  5% of 
patients overall) were contusion (9.0%), diarrhea (8.6%), and fatigue (8.3%). All other drug- related TEAEs were reported in < 5% of patients (ie, <  17 patients each). 
Treatment -emergent AEs of severity Grade 3 or 4 were reported in 87 of 324 patients 
(26.9%) in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts, with 41 (12.7%) of these Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported as related to study drug.  
• On-study death (death within 28 days of the last dose of  study drug) due to a Grade 5 
(fatal) AE was reported in 4 of 324 patients (1.2%) in the Phase 1/2 Monotherapy cohorts . One Grade 5 AE, Enterococcus faecium -related septic shock,  was considered 
to be related to study drug (further details are provided in the LOXO -305 IB).
1 All 
other Grade 5 AEs were considered to be not related to study drug; these included pneumonia fungal, shock, and pleural effusion. 
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO- BTK-20014 study (headache, nausea, and vomiting), were all Grade 1 in 
severity and considered  to be related to LOXO -305. All 3 events were reported by 1 subject 
and resolved within 1 to 1.5 days.  
Treatment -emergent AEs  reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO- BTK-20006 study (intermittent belching, bloating, insect bite, aphthous ulcer, 
nause a, intermittent diarrhea [x2], muscle twitch), were all Grade 1 in severity , and bloating, 
1 instance of intermittent diarrhea, and intermittent belching were considered to be related to 
LOXO-305 and rifampin. All 7 AEs were reported by 3 subjects and all events resolved prior to End of Treatment (EOT; preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s 
development).  
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO- BTK-20017 study (headache [observed at the 300 mg LOXO -305 dose], and 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 22 of 79 headache [ x2], intermittent headache , and petechial rash left thigh [observed at the 90 0 mg 
LOXO- 305 dose] ), were all Grade 1 in severity . One instance of headache observed at the 
300 mg LOXO-305 dose and 1 instance  observed at the 900 mg LOXO-305 dose, the  
intermittent headache , and the petechial rash left thigh were considered to be related to 
LOXO-305. All five AEs were reported by 4 subjects and resolved within 2 hours to 5 days 
of onset ( preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s development). 
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in Part 1 of the LOXO- BTK -20007 study (bloody nose, headache, loose stool [x2], red 
bumps on left knee, small abrasion to right el bow) , were all Grade 1 in severity and headache 
was considered to be related to LOXO -305. All 7 AEs were reported by 4 subjects and all 
events resolved within 1 to 2 days ( preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s 
development).  
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in Part 2 of the LOXO- BTK -20007 study (tenderness at left venipuncture site [x2], bruising 
to left antecubital secondary to phlebotomy [x2], bruising to right antecubital secondary to 
phlebotomy, and allergic reaction), were all Grade 1 in severity and no events were 
considered to be related to LOXO-305. All 6 AEs were reported by 4 subjects and all events 
resolved within 1 to 2 days ( preliminary data on file at the time of this prot ocol’s 
development).  
Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO- BTK-20008 study (injection site pain, nasal congestion, flatulence, 
constipation, increased urinary frequency, facial rash, and skin tear from tape at IV site) , were 
all Grade 1 in severity , and flatulence, constipation, and increased urinary frequency were 
considered to be related to LOXO-305. All 7 AEs were reported by 3 subjects and all events 
resolved within 1 to 8 days ( preliminary data on file at the time of this protocol’s 
development).  
As part of each clinical trial conducted in patients or healthy volunteers, ECG and vital signs 
are performed at intervals specified by protocol. For study LOXO- BTK-18001 conducted in 
patients, no clinically significant findings of QTc prolongation have been identified in 330 patients as of  September 27, 2020 (LOXO-305 IB
1). In addition, there have been no clinically 
significant abnormal findings in vital signs and ECG data in the studies investigating LOXO-305 conducted in healthy volunteers as of November 23, 2020 ( preliminary data on 
file at the time of this protocol’s development).  
1.4.2. Pharmacokinetics  
As of September 30, 2020, PK data were available from 181 patients enrolled in the 
LOXO- BTK -18001 study. Steady- state PK parameters of LOXO -305 in these cancer patients 
could be derived from data collected on Cycle 1 Day 8 ( Figure 1),  and are shown in Table  1. 
These data show that LOXO -305 is absorbed after oral administration with a median time to 
maximum observed plasma concentration (t
max) of approximately 2 hours and low clearance 
(Table  1). Due to the limited sampling interval (0 -8 hours), imputation for the 24-hour sample 
was made from Cycle 1 Day 8 predose sample, leading to an estimated plasma half -life of 
approximately 20 hours. Maximum observed plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) of LOXO-305 showed increase proportional to dose

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 23 of 79 (Figure 2 ). Following administration of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) 200 mg QD, 
mean trough plasma levels of LOXO-305 exceeded the concentration required for 96% 
inhibition of BTK in vitro (IC 50 = , IC 96 = ). Further details may be 
found in the IB.1 
Pharmacokinetic data following oral administration of a 200-mg dose of LOXO-305 in tablet 
form in healthy volunteers in the LOXO- BTK- 20014 study indicate that there was little effect 
of either a standard meal or the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole on the PK of LOXO-305.

1.5. Study Rationale  
Cardiac safety is a major factor in clinical development given that the effects of new drugs in 
delaying cardiac repolarization are a common cause for drug withdrawal from the market and delays in, or denial of, regulatory approval for marketing. The potential effect of a drug on cardiac repolarization can be measured as prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiographic recordings.  
Regulatory guidance (International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E14) has emphasized the need to obtain clear robust data on the effect of new chemical entities on ECG parameters with focus on cardiac repolarization as measured by the QTc duration.
9 Most cli nical trials 
due to insufficient sample size, infrequent sampling of ECG data, or the lack of placebo or positive pharmacologic controls are not adequately powered to overcome the high rate of spontaneous change in QTc duration. The most recent R3 Q&A document updating the ICH E14 guidance
10, specifies that concentration -response analysis, in the correct setting, may 
serve as the primary basis for decisions to classify the proarrhythmic risk of a new drug.  
The study design includes the use of a placebo, a supratherapeutic dose of  LOXO- 305 (to 
mimic the exposure in healthy subjects that may occur in the target population under the most extreme circumstances and to assess the effect on cardiac repolarization), and a positive control, moxifloxacin. Modeling the concentration -QT (C- QT) relationship observed during 
this study will characterize the QT prolongation effect over the observed drug concentration at a supratherapeutic dose of LOXO- 305 to assess the drug cardiac effect at therapeutic 
doses.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 26 of 79 1.6. Risk Assessment  
Subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an assessment 
of their medical status) from participating in the study. The risks of participation are 
primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there ma y 
also be some discomfort from collection of blood samples and other study procedures.  
The therapeutic dose of LOXO-305 is 200 mg QD which at steady state has a geometric 
mean C max of . It is expected that the worst- case scenario during maximal 
CYP3A4 inhibition will be an increase in the C max of <  2 fold. Thus, the study will target a 
dose of LOXO-305 that achieves a C max of . The supratherapeutic dose of 
900 mg LOXO -305 selected for this study is anticipated to result in a mean C max of 
approximately  based on the data to date from the SAD study 
(LOXO- BTK-20017) and is not anticipated to induce any potential risk to subjects 
participating in this study.  More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, 
and re asonably anticipated AEs associated with LOXO -305 may be found in the IB.1  
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride (HCl) is a synthetic C-8-methoxy-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent. The recommended oral dose is 400 mg QD for 5 to 21 days, depending on the specific infection.
11 Following administration of the usual therapeutic dose (400 mg), peak plasma 
levels occur at approximately 1.5 hours and the elimination half-life of moxifloxaci n is about 
13 hours. Moxifloxacin prolongs QT interval duration and is used as a positive control in most thorough QT (TQT) studies to determine study sensitivity. The most common AEs seen with moxifloxacin are nausea, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness. The moxifloxacin dosing regimen for this study is within the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing regimen and the risk of moxifloxacin- induced Torsade de Pointes is expected to be minimal 
when the drug is administered at the recommended dose. 
 
The safety monitoring practices employed will include AE reporting, vital sign measurements, standard safety 12 -lead ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and physical 
examinations, and are considered adequate to protect the subjects’ safety.

2.1. Objectives  
2.1.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is: 
• to evaluate the effect of a supratherapeutic dose of LOXO -305 on the QTc interval 
corrected for heart rate  (HR)  compared with placebo in healthy subjects.  
2.1.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• to assess the effect of a single supratherapeutic dose exposure of LOXO -305 on other  
ECG parameters (HR, PR, and QRS intervals) and on T-wave morphology changes 
compared with placebo in healthy subjects . 
• to dem onstrate assay sensitivity of the study to detect a small QTc effect using 
400 mg oral moxifloxacin as a positive control in healthy subjects. 
• to evaluate the PK of a single supratherapeutic dose of LOXO -305 in healthy subjects. 
• to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single supratherapeutic dose of LOXO-305 
in healthy subjects.  
2.2. Endpoints  
2.2.1. Primary Endpoint  
2.2.1.1. Cardiodynamic 
• Placebo -corrected change from baseline (ΔΔ) QTc interval (ΔΔQTc). The default will 
be ΔΔQTcF with QTc interval corrected for HR using t he Fridericia method (QTcF). 
If a substantial HR effect is observed (ie, the largest least squares [LS] mean ΔΔHR is 
greater than 1 0 bpm in the by-time point analysis), other correction methods such as 
optimized HR- corrected QT interval (QTcI), and individ ual HR -corrected QT interval 
(QTcS) will be explored and compared. The method that removes the HR dependence of the QT interval most efficiently will be chosen as the primary correction method for this primary endpoint. 
2.2.2. Secondary Endpoints  
2.2.2.1. Cardiodynamic 
• Change from baseline (Δ) QTcF, HR, PR, QRS intervals (ΔQTcF, ∆HR, ∆PR, and 
∆QRS)  
• If a substantial HR effect is observed: Change- from -baseline QTcS, and QTcI 
(ΔQTcS, and ΔQTcI)  
• Placebo -corrected change from baseline HR, PR, and QRS (ΔΔHR, ΔΔ PR, ΔΔQRS)  
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419690 Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20011 
Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 28 of 79 • If a substantial HR effect is observed: Placebo -correcte d ΔQTcF, and/or ∆ QTcS, 
and/or ∆ QTcI ( ΔΔQTcF, ∆∆QTcS, ∆∆QTcI) if not selected as the primary endpoint  
• Categorical outliers for QTcF (and QTcS, and QTcI if a substantial HR effect is 
observed) , HR, PR, and QRS  
• Frequency of trea tment -emergent changes of T -wave morphology and U- wave 
presence.  
2.2.2.2. Pharmacokinetic  
The following PK parameters will be calculated, whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of LOXO-305 (as appropriate): 
• AUC from hour  0 to 24 hours postdose (AUC 0-24) 
• AUC from hour  0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0-t) 
• AUC from hour 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf) 
• percentage extrapolation for AUC 0-inf (%AUC extrap) 
• apparent systemic clearance (CL/F)  
• Cmax 
• apparent plasma terminal elimination half -life (t½) 
• tmax 
• apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λ Z) 
• apparent volume of distribution at the terminal phase (V z/F) 
• mean residence time (MRT)  
In addition, c oncentrations of moxifloxacin in plasma will be assessed  
. 
2.2.2.3. Safety  
Safet y and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs, performing physical examinations 
and clinical laboratory evaluations, measuring vital signs, and recording standard safety 12-lead ECGs.

3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a si ngle-dose, randomized, partially double- blind (for LOXO -305 only, not 
moxifloxacin), placebo- and positive- controlled, 3-way crossover design study.  
All subjects will participate in 3 treatment periods (Treatment Periods 1, 2, and 3); in each 
treatment period, subjects will receive either a single oral dose of 90 0 mg LOXO-305 
(Treatment A), a single oral dose of 900 mg LOXO-305 matched placebo  (Treatment B), or a 
single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin (Treatment C). All subjects will receive Treatments A, B, and C on 1 occasion during the study. There will be a washout period of at least 
10 days between dosing in each period. 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences (eg, ABC), according to the 
randomization scheme issued by Covance. A total of 30 subjects will be randomized, such that 5 subjects will be assigned to each treatment sequence (see Table  3 for treatment 
sequences).  
Each treatment (A, B, and C)  will be administered orally in the mornings of Day 1, Day 12, 
and Day 23 following a fast of at least 8 hours prior to and 6 hours after dosing. 
Blood samples for the analysis of plasma concentrations of LOXO -305 will be collected for 
96 hours after administration of LOXO-305 (Treatment A) and LOXO-305 matched placebo 
(Treatment B), and  (Treatment C).  Additional 
blood samples will be collected for 96  hours after administration of LOXO-305 (Treatment 
A) and LOXO-305 matched placebo (Treatment B) and will be stored for future potential and/or exploratory analysis.  
Blood samples from Treatment A will be analyzed for concentration s of LOXO-305 in 
plasma through 96 hours after administration of LOXO-305. Blood s amples from Treatment 
B will be analyzed for  concentrations of LOXO-305 in plasma only at the single timepoint 
taken 2 hours after administration of LOXO -305 matched placebo . Blood samples from 
Treatment C will be analyzed for concentrations of moxifloxacin in plasma through  
. Cardiodynamic sampling will be obtained for 24 hours 
after administration of each dose in all treatments (A, B, and C).  
The schematic of the study design is displayed in  Figure 3.  
The start of the study is defined as the date the first subject who is enrolled in the study signs 
an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Note that enrolled subjects are defined as those subjects who are assigned to receive a dose of study drug; this definition excludes scree n failure 
subjects. Replacement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary by the Sponsor. 
Subjects who are determined to be screen failures are permitted to be re -screened if the 
Investigator (or designee), with agreement from the Sponsor, feels that the subject may meet 
eligibility criteria upon re -screen. Re -screened subjects will be provided a new subject 
number.

To assess their eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28 days 
(Days -29 to - 2) and be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1 (Check-in). 
Subjects will be confined at the CRU from the time of Check-in (Day -1) until EOT on 
Day 33 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or Early Termination (ET) if the 
subject discontinues. Subjects will be dosed on Days 1, 12, and 23. A follow-up phone call will occur for all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug (including subjects who are terminated early) 7  days (± 2 day s) after EOT or ET. The duration of participation is 
expected to be approximately 71 days (Screening through follow-up phone call). 
In this study, physical examinations, standard safety 12- lead ECGs, vital sign measurements, 
How Do You Feel? (HDYF?) inquir ies, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation parameters, 
hematology panel, urinalysis (UA; Appendix 2), and recording of concomitant medications 
will be performed at specified times during the study (for specific timep oints and details on 
each study variable, refer to Appendix 4).  
Adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS], or until ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow- up phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as 
beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed a s related to 
study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call) are to be reported.

3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
The study design includes the use of a placebo, a supratherapeutic dose of LOXO -305 to 
mimic the exposure in healthy subjects that may occur in the target population under the most 
extreme circumstances and to assess the effect on cardiac repolarization and a positive 
control, moxifloxacin. Modeling the C -QT relationship observed during this study will 
characterize the QT prolongation effect over the observed drug concentration of a supratherapeutic dose of LOXO- 305 to assess the drug cardiac effect at therapeutic doses.  
A randomized crossover design has bee n selected to minimize assignment bias and to allow 
each subject to serve as his or her own control, which improves the precision of the estimated treatment differences as well as decreasing the overall number of subjects needed for the study. It will be a partially double-blind study with respect to LOXO-305 and LOXO-305 
matched placebo because blinding eliminates confounding by concomitant interventions and biased safety findings, thus eliminating the possibility that the observed effects of intervention are because of differential use of other treatments or biased expectations 
regarding safety. 
Placebo has been chosen as the control treatment to assess whether any observed effects are 
treatment-related or simply reflect the study conditions. Moxifloxacin as a single 400- mg 
dose is a standard positive control to be used in QT studies to assess assay sensitivity. This product has been shown to produce a peak QTc prolongation ranging from 10 to 15 msec in crossover design studies,
12,13 with a mean QTc prolongation of about 5 msec. Hence, 
moxifloxacin-induced changes in ventricular repolarization, when compared to the placebo treatment in healthy subjects, will be used to evaluate assay sensitivity.
13,11 
The sampling scheme is expected to adequately characterize the LOXO -305 
exposure-response relationship including hysteresis and late effects and diurnal variability, and the washout period of at least 10 days between each treatment period is considered sufficient to pr event carryover effects of the treatments.  
Conducting the study in healthy adult subjects mitigates the potential confounding effects of the disease state and concomitant medications.  
3.3. Selection of Doses in the Study  
3.3.1. LOXO -305 
A single dose of LOXO-305 (900 mg) has been selected as a supratherapeutic dose to provide a single-dose C
max that is approximately 2- fold greater than that of the steady -state C max of 
LOXO-305 at its RP2D in cancer patients, specifically 12860 ng/mL. This target concentration of 12860 ng/mL is 2 -fold greater than the geometric mean of  from 
the dosage of 200 mg QD as shown in Table  1. The approximate 2-fold greater C
max planned 
for this study, relative to the steady -state C max in cancer p atients, is to account for factors that 
may reduce the clearance and increase the levels of LOXO -305, for example disease states, or 
concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the metabolism of LOXO-305. LOXO-305 is metabolized by CYP3A4; emerging data at the time of development of this protocol indicate 
CCI
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419690 Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20011 
Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 32 of 79 that the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole caused an approximate 34% increase in 
LOXO-305 exposure (AUC 0-t), but other factors such as hepatic impairment or other settings 
could make the increase in LOXO-305 exposure larger. Testing plasma concentrations approximately 2- fold higher than geometric mean C
max in cancer patients is therefore 
anticipated to represent a “worst case” supra-therapeutic exposure. The dose of 900 mg 
LOXO-305 was selected based upon data from the ongoing LOXO- BTK-20017 SAD Study 
and is expected to achieve a mean  Cmax of approximately . 
Single doses of 300 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, and 900 mg LOXO -305 have been administered to 
healthy volunteers in Study LOXO- BTK -20017. Preliminary s afety and tolerability analysis 
showed no clinically significant abnormal findings in vital signs and ECG data. Treatment -emergent AEs reported following LOXO-305 administration in healthy volunteers 
in the LOXO- BTK-20017 study (headache [observed at the 300 mg LOXO -305 dose], and 
headache [x2], intermittent headache, and petechial rash left thigh [observed at the 900 mg 
LOXO-305 dose]), were all Grade 1 in severity. One instance of headache observed at the 300 mg LOXO-305 dose and 1 instance observed at the 900 mg LOXO-305 dose, the 
intermittent headache, and the petechial rash left thigh were considered to be related to LOXO-305. All five AEs were reported by 4 subjects and resolved within 2 hours to 5 days of onset (preliminary data on file at the time of  this protocol’s development). 
3.3.2. Moxifloxacin 
A single 400-mg dose is a standard positive control to be used in QT studies. This product has been shown to produce a peak QTc prolongation ranging from 10 to  15 msec in crossover 
design studies
12,13, with a mean QTc prolongation of approximately 5 msec which is the 
threshold of regulatory concern. Hence, moxifloxacin-induced changes in ve ntricular 
repolarization, when compared to the placebo treatment in healthy subjects, will be used to evaluate assay sensitivity.
13,11 If the slope of the moxifloxacin plasma concentration/∆QTc 
relationship is statistically significant at the 10% level in a 2 -sided test and the lower bound 
of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval ( CI) of the predicted QT effect at the observed 
geometric C max of the 400 mg dose is above 5 ms ec, assay sensitivity will be deemed to have 
been demonstrated. The dosing regimen for moxifloxacin in this study is within the FDA-approved dosing regimen.

contraceptive requirements. Periodic abs tinence by a female pa rtner (eg, calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation me thods) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception. If a male subject is abstinent at the time of signing the ICF 
but becomes sexually active from Check-in (Day -1) through 6 months after Day 23 
(or last administration of study drug if subj ect terminates from the study early), he 
must agree to use contraception as described above. 
For male subjects, sexual intercourse with female partners who are pregnant, or 
breastfeeding should be avoi ded from Check-in (Day -1 ) through 6 months after 
Day 23 (or last administration of study drug if subject terminates from the study

5.2. Study Treatment Administration  
Subjects will receive each of the following treatments once throughout the study:  
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419690 Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20011 
Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 44 of 79 Treatment A:  
• A single oral dose of 900 mg LOXO -305 (36 × 25 -mg tablets, over- encapsulated [9 
capsules]), following a fast of at least 8  hours prior to and 6 hours after dosing. 
Treatment B:  
• A single oral dose of placebo to match 900 mg LOXO-305 (9 capsules), following a 
fast of at least 8  hours prior to and 6 hours after dosing. 
Treatment C:  
• A single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin (1  × 400 mg tablet), following a fast of at 
least 8  hours prior to and 6 hours after dosing. 
All study drugs will be administered with approximately 240 mL of water. An additional 
volume of up to approximately 240 mL of water may be administered if needed. Water will be restricted for 1 -hour predose and 1-hour postdose, with the exception of water 
administered for dose administration.  
Each unit dose will be prepared by qualified CRU staff.  
Appropriate unit dose(s), as described above, will be administered to subjects. Although the 
timing of events requires that each subject will be administered the appropriate dose at a specific time, the exact dose time of subjects may be staggered to obviate the need  to have all 
subjects on precisely the same study schedule. For each dose, the subject’s actual dose time will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed into the eCRF. 
Subjects will be instructed not to crush, split, or chew the study drugs. 
Following dosing, subjects will remain lying down or sitting and awake for the first 7 hours 
of the 24-hour postdose cardiodynamic ECG monitoring period, as the QT-RR relationship is 
different during sleep. Subjects will be required to lie quietly in a supine position with minimal movement and minimal exposure to noise and other environmental stimuli (ie, TV, loud radio, interactions with other subjects, etc.) for at least 10  minutes before and 5 minutes 
during the ECG extraction to allow for quality ECG extraction. In the event that an AE(s) occurs at any time during cardiodynamic ECG recordings, subjects may be placed in an appropriate position or will be permitted to lie down on their right side.  
5.3. Randomization 
Subjects will be assigned a unique identification number upon screening. Subjects who 
complete the study screening assessments and meet all the eligibility criteria will be assigned a unique randomization identification number (in accordance with the requirements in Section  4.5 and the randomization scheme generated by Covance) prior to the time of the first 
dose, different from the screening number, and will receive the corresponding product according to the randomization scheme generated by Covance.  
Subjects w ill be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences ( Table  3), according to the 
randomization scheme issued by Covance.

The randomization scheme and corresponding subject assignment will be available only to 
the CRU pharmacy staff that is preparing the doses of LOXO -305, LOXO- 305 matched 
placebo, and moxifloxacin. These CRU pharmacy staff will not be involved in any other aspect of the study including administration of the doses to subjects. The randomization scheme and corresponding subject assignment will also be available to the bioanalytical laboratory as sample analysis will be treatment -dependent (ie, different method, and dilutions 
depending on the treatment). It will not be made available to the Sponsor, subjects, members of the CRU staff responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of safety assessments (including the members of the CRU staff responsible for ECG reading). 
5.4. Blinding  
This is a partially double-blind study with respect to LOXO-305 and LOXO- 305 matched 
placebo, of which LOXO-305 will be supplied as tablets, which will be over- encapsulated by 
the CRU pharmacy staff and placebo will be supplied as a powder to fill capsules by the CRU 
pharmacy staff to maintain the blind. Moxifloxacin treatment (positive control) will be administered in an open-label fashion.  
5.4.1. Procedures for Breaking the Blind  Prior to Study Completion  
One set of sealed envelopes containing the randomization code will be supplied to the 
Investigator (or designee)  at each site  at the start of the study.  
Breaking of the blind is expressly forbidden except in the event of a medica l emergency 
where the identity of the drug must be known in order to properly treat the subject.  
In the event of a medical emergency, it is requested that the Investigator (or designee) make 
every effort to contact the Sponsor prior to breaking the blind. If breaking the blind is 
required because of a medical emergency, the treatment identity would be revealed by the 
Investigator (or designee) for that subject only. In the event that the medical emergency is one in which it appears that the other subjects may be at imminent risk, the blind may be broken for all subjects who have received study drug(s). The unblinding will be properly documented in the study file. 
In all cases where the randomization code is broken, the Investigator (or designee) should 
record the date and reason for code breaking. 
At the end of the study, envelopes will be retained or destroyed according to relevant Covance CRU SOPs and procedures unless specified otherwise by the Sponsor.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 46 of 79 5.4.2. Revealing of Randomization 
In the absence of a medical emergency, the blinded randomization for this study will not be 
revealed until all data are entered in the database, edits checks are performed, queries closed, 
and the database is officially locked.  
Preliminary data and any data received from the bioanalytical laboratory prior to the clinical 
database lock will be blinded (using dummy IDs). 
5.5. Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance: 
• All doses will be administered under the supervision of suitably qualif ied CRU staff.  
• Immediately after oral dose administration, a visual inspection of the mouth and 
hands will be performed for each subject.  
• At each dose preparation occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of LOXO-305, LOXO-305 matched placebo, and moxifloxacin, as appropriate, will be performed. 
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The Investigator (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of the study 
supplies (including LOXO -305 tablets, excipient [for LOXO- 305 matched placebo], capsules 
to over- encapsulate LOXO -305 and excipient [for LOXO-305 matched placebo powder], and 
moxifloxacin tablets) received from the Sponsor or procured by Covance. In addition, an 
accurate drug disposition record will be kept, specifying the amount dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensing. This drug accountability record will be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the study, the original drug accountability record will be available for review by the Sponsor upon request. 
For each batch of unit doses, the empty used unit dose containers will be discarded upon 
satisfactory completion of the compliance and accountability procedures. Any unused assembled unit doses will be retained until completion of the study. 
At the completion of the study, all unused LOXO-305 tablets will be disposed of by the CRU 
in accordance with the CRU’s SOPs and local/state/federal guidelines governing waste disposal of investigational drugs, following the Sponsor’s written authorization. Placebo powder and moxifloxacin tablets and will be disposed of by the CRU in accordance with the CRU’s SOPs.

the exception of moxifloxacin administered for the purposes of this study/in accordance with the protocol), herbal products, vitamin supplements, natural or herbal supplements, and HRT are prohibited for 14 days or 5 half-lives (if known), whichever is longer, prior to Day 1 and through EOT or ET, unle ss deemed acceptable by the, Investigator (or designee), and 
Sponsor. Any medication taken by a subject during the course of the study, including details of its dosage, administration, and the reason for its use, will be documented in the eCRF. 
The administration of any concomitant medication during the study is prohibited without 
prior approval of the Investigator (or designee) and Sponsor, unless its use is deemed necessary in a medical emergency. In this case, the use of the concomitant medication will be reported as soon as is practical.  
6.2. Diet, Fluid, and Activity Control 
Subjects are required to refrain from use of tobacco, smoking-cessation products, 
nicotine-containing products and e-cigarettes (nicotine and non- nicotine), within 3  months 
prior to Scre ening through EOT or ET. 
Consumption of foods or beverages containing grapefruit/grapefruit juice or Seville oranges 
or its juice within 7  days prior to Check- in (Day  -1) and through EOT or ET will not be 
allowed. 
Consumption of alcohol- or caffeine-containing foods or beverages within 5 days prior to 
Check -in (Day  -1) and through EOT or ET will not be allowed. 
On Days 1, 12, and 23, subjects will be fasted for at least 8  hours prior to dosing through 
6 hours postdose. Water will be restricted for 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after dosing, with the exception of water administered for dose administration.  
On Days 1, 12, and 23, a light meal will be provided immediately following completion of 
the cardiodynamic ECG recording at the 6-hour postdose timepoint and a full meal will be provided immediately after the 12-hour postdose timepoints. A snack can also be given just after the 8. 5-hour postdose timepoint. Meals and snacks must be scheduled to be completed at 
least 90  minutes prior to any scheduled ECG (ie, st andard safety 12- lead ECG, or 
cardiodynamic ECG). Otherwise, while confined at the CRU, subjects will receive a standard diet at scheduled times that do not conflict with other study- related activities.  
Fasting requirement in relation to dosing are describ ed in Section  3.1 and Section  5.2.

7.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.1.1. Pharmacokinetic Blood Sample Collection and Processing  
Blood samples for PK analysis of plasma concentrations of LOXO-305, LOXO- 305 matched 
placebo, moxifloxaci n plasma levels, and for future potential and/or exploratory analysis  will 
be collected at the timepoints specified in Appendix 4 . The exact time of the study drug 
administration and the actual time of blood sampling for PK analysis will be recorded on the 
eCRF.  
Processing, storage, and shipping instructions for these PK blood samples and for blood 
samples collected for future potential and/or exploratory analysis will be provided in a 
separate Laboratory Manual . The number of blood samples and total blood volume required 
for PK testing is presented in Appendix 3. 
7.1.2. Analytical Methodology 
Concentrations of LOXO-305 and moxifloxacin in plasma will be determined using validated 
bioanalytical methods. For PK samples collected for LOXO-305 matched placebo, only the samples collected 2 hours postdose will be analyzed for concentrations of LOXO- 305 or  
moxifloxacin, as appropriate. Specifics of the bioanalytical methods will be provided in a separate document.  
7.2. Cardiodynamic Assessments  
7.2.1. Cardiodynamic ECGs (Holter Monitoring)  
Holter monitors will be used to collect continuous 12-lead ECG data for the purpose of collecting cardiodynamic ECGs for approximately 25.5 hours, starting at approximately 1.5 hours prior to dosing and at least 24 hours postdose. Recording will be started and stopped at logistically optimal times to ensure that all scheduled time points are collected. Up to 10 replicate 12 -lead ECG recording s will be extracted from the continuous Holter 
recording at the timepoints specified in Appendix 4, prior to the collection of blood samples for PK analysis.  
Timing and recording technique for ECGs will be standardi zed for all subjects. Subjects must 
be awakened at least 1 hour prior to the start of the cardiodynamic ECGs on the day of dosing 
and before the ECG recording scheduled at the 24-hour postdose timepoint as specified in Appendix 4.  
Following dosing on days where cardiodynamic ECG assessments are performed, subjects 
will remain lying down or sitting and awake for the first 7  hours of the 24-hour postdose 
cardiodynamic ECG monitoring period, as the QT-RR relationship is different during sleep. Subjects will be required to lie quietly in a supine position with minimal movement and minimal exposure to noise and other environmental stimuli (ie, TV, loud radio, interactions with other subjects, etc.) for at least 10  minutes before and 5 minutes during the ECG 
extraction to allow for quality ECG extraction. In the event that an AE(s) occurs at any time 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419690 Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20011 
Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 50 of 79 during cardiodynamic ECG recordings, subjects may be placed in an appropriate position or 
will be permitted to lie down on the ir right side.  
All ECG extraction should occur in a 5-minute time window around the scheduled/nominal time and always precede the PK draw. If targeted ECG timepoints are artefactual or of poor quality, analyzable 10- second ECGs will be extracted as close as possible to the targeted time 
points.  
The 12-lead Holter and ECG equipment will be supplied and supported by ERT. All ECG 
data will be collected using a Global Instrumentation (Manlius, NY, USA) M12R ECG continuous 12-lead digital recorder. The continuous 12- lead digital ECG data will be stored 
onto SD memory cards. ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected by pre-determined timepoints as defined in the Appendix 4 and will be read centrally by ERT. 
The foll owing principles will be followed in ERT’s core laboratory:  
• ECG readers are blinded to the subject, visit, and treatment allocation  
• A limited number of readers will be employed for the study 
• Baseline and on -treatment ECGs for a particular subject will be o ver-read on the same 
lead and will be analyzed by the same reader  
• The primary analysis lead is lead II. If lead II is not analyzable, then primary lead of 
analysis will be changed to another lead for the entire subject data set 
The following is a brief description of ECG analysis methods utilized by ERT’s core laboratory. 
7.2.1.1. TQT Plus ECG Extraction Technique  
Ten 14-second digital 12-lead ECG tracings will be extracted from the continuous Holter 
recordings using the ‘TQT Plus method’, a computer- assisted and st atistical process utilized 
by ERT. The method enables extraction of ECGs with the lowest HR variability and noise within the protocol-specified extraction time window (eg, the HR and QT changes from beat-to-beat in the range of <  10%). At each protocol-specified timepoint, 10 ECG replicates 
will be extracted from a 5 -minute “ECG window” (typically, the last 5  minutes of the 
15-minute period when the subject is maintained in a supine or semi-recumbent quiet position).  
7.2.1.2. Expert -Precision QT Analysis  
Expert- precision QT analysis will be performed on all analyzable (non- artifact) beats in the 
10 ECG replicates. Statistical quality control procedures are used to review and assess all beats and identify “high” and “low” confidence beats using several criteria, inclu ding: 
• QT or QTc values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely) 
• RR values exceeding or below certain thresholds (biologically unlikely) 
• Rapid changes in QT, QTc, or RR from beat- to-beat 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419690 Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20011 
Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 51 of 79 Measurements of all primary ECG parameters (QT, Q Tc, RR) in all recorded beats of all 
replicates that are deemed “high confidence” are performed using COMPAS software. All 
low confidence beats are reviewed manually and adjudicated using pass- fail criteria. The 
final QC assessment is performed by a cardio logist. The beats found acceptable by manual 
review are included in the analysis. The median QT, QTc, and RR value from each extracted replicate is calculated, and then the mean of all available medians from a nominal timepoint is used as the subject’s rep ortable value at that timepoint.  
Categorical T -wave morphology analysis and the measurement of PR and QRS intervals will 
be performed manually in 3 of the 10 ECG replicates at each timepoint. Each fiducial point (onset of P-wave, onset of Q-wave, offset of S-wave, and offset of T- wave) is electronically 
marked. 
For T-wave morphology and U- wave presence, treatment -emergent changes will be assessed, 
ie, changes not present at baseline. For each category of T-wave morphology and of 
U-waves, the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate at the timepoint. 
For baseline, the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicate from all 
timepoints that constitute baseline. Nominal time of the cardiodynamic ECG recording will 
be used for the cardiodynamic analysis.  
Procedures for ECG extraction and Early Precision QT evaluation at the central ECG laboratory (ERT) will be provided separately.  
7.3. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety evaluations may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee) or Sponsor. 
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures in accordance with the 
nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, and any other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. The order of priority for scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in order of priority): 
• dosing 
• ECG extraction (for cardiodynamic assessments)  
• PK blood sampling 
• vital sign measurements  * 
• standard safety 12 -lead ECGs  * 
• blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory evaluations  
• physical examination 
* When vital sign measurements and standard safety 12 -lead ECGs are scheduled at the same 
time as PK blood sampling, the PK blood sampling will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the vital sign measurements followed by standard safety 12- lead ECGs will be 
obtained prior to and as close as possible to the scheduled PK blood sampling.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 52 of 79 7.3.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event definitions; assignment of severity, causality, action taken, and outcome; and 
procedures for reporting SAEs are detailed in Appendix 1. 
Subjects will be asked a non -leading HDYF? question such as “Have there been any changes 
in your health status since Screening/since you we re last asked?” at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4 (ie, at Screening [after the ICF is signed], at Check -in [Day  -1], at each 
postdose vital sign measurement, and at an appropriate time for all other days). S ubjects will 
also be encouraged to voluntarily report AEs occurring at any other time through the EOS. Adverse events, whether volunteered, identified by the subject’s responses to HDYF? 
inquiries, or noted on physical examination, standard safety ECG, vit al sign measurements, or 
clinical laboratory evaluations, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, from signing of the ICF until EOS [or ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call]), either as subject medic al history (if the event is reported as beginning 
prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event o ccurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 
and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call) are to be reported. 
Unless a subject withdraws consent or is withdrawn from the study and does not complete the 
follow-up phone call, all subjects must be followed until EOS. Subjects with AEs that a re 
assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) which are ongoing at EOS may continue to be followed until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by the Investigator (or designee) and confirmed by the Sponsor. The Investigator (or designee) should use appropriate judgment in ordering additional tests as necessary to monitor the resolution of events. The Sponsor may request that additional safety tests be performed.  
Subjects will receive a follow-up phone call 7 days (± 2 days) after EOT or ET to determine 
if any SAE or drug- related AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit.  
At all times, a subject may be required to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee).  
Any event that meets the criteria of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction 
(SUSAR) will be reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to CRU policy by the Investigator (or designee) and to regulatory authorities by the Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to regulatory authority requirements. Refer to Reference Safety Information in the current IB
1 for LOXO-305 for additional safety information.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 53 of 79 7.3.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory evaluations (clinical chemistry pan el [fasted at least 8  hours; at ET or the 
day before EOT, subjects are not required to be fasted prior to clinical laboratory 
evaluations], coagulation parameters, hematology panel, TSH [Screening only], HbA1c [Screening only], eGFR [Screening and Check- in (Day -1)], and UA) will be collected at the 
timepoints specified in  Appendix 4. 
Screens for HCV antibody, HBsAg, HBV IgM core antibody, and HIV antibody will be performed at Screening.  
Testing for COVID -19 via PCR (or equivalent) will be performed at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4. Testing for COVID-19 may also be conducted periodically during the 
subject’s CRU confinement, at the discretion of the Investigator (or d esignee). Further details 
regarding COVID -19 testing (including procedures for subjects who test positive at any time 
throughout CRU confinement) are specified in a separate document.  
A urine drug screen for selected drugs of abuse (including cotinine) and an  alcohol screen 
(urine or breath ) will be performed at Screening and repeated at Check -in (Day  -1) for all 
subjects.  
A serum qualitative pregnancy test (female subjects only [serum quantitative may be used for confirmation , if needed]) and an FSH test (post- menopausal female subjects only) will be 
performed at the timepoints specified in  Appendix 4. 
The number of blood samples and total blood volume required for clinical laboratory 
evaluations are presented in Appendix 3.A list of the specific evaluations is inAppendix 2. 
7.3.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements (including body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and supi ne BP and pulse rate) will be obtained at the timepoints specified in  Appendix 4. 
Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be performed using the same arm for each reading and measurements should be taken after the subject has been resting in the supine position for at least 5 minutes. 
When vital sign measurements are scheduled at the same time as PK blood draws, the PK 
blood draws will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the vital sign measurements will be obtained prior to and as close as possible to the scheduled PK blood draw. 
7.3.4. Standard Safety 12 -lead Electrocardiogram  
A standard safety 12-lead ECG (including HR, PR, RR, QRS, and QT interval parameters) 
will be obtained after the subject has been r esting for at least 10  minutes in the supine 
position at the timepoints specified in Appendix 4. There will be no significant stimuli such as TV, loud radio, interactions with other subjects. The QT interval will be corrected for HR by Fridericia’s (QTcF  = QT/[RR]
1/3) formula. In the event that an AE(s) occur at any time 
during safety ECG recordings, subjects may be placed in an appropriate position or will be permitted to lie down on their right side.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 54 of 79 When standard safety 12 -lead ECGs are scheduled at the same time as PK blood draws, the 
PK blood draws will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the standard safety 12- lead 
ECGs will be obtained prior to and as close as possible to the scheduled PK blood draw. 
In all cases in which a standard safety ECG has a potentially concerning finding (eg, QTcF 
> 500 msec, increase from baseline QTcF > 75 msec), or an abnormal and potentially 
clinically significant observation, it will be repeated within 30  minutes and the EC Gs will be 
reviewed independently by the ECG core laboratory or, if not feasible, by a cardiac electrophysiologist prior to any study disposition decisions that do not constitute a patient emergency. The safety ECG data, including all timepoints, will be recorded on the eCRF and used for evaluating general safety of the subjects during study and for evaluation of an AE. The ECG core laboratory analysis will constitute the ECG analysis used for all study decisions as well as the primary ECG analysis for the study. 
7.3.5. Physical Examination  
A complete or abbreviated physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 4
. Complete physical examinations will evaluate general appearance and the 
following body systems/organs: dermatological; head and eyes; ears, nose, mouth, and throat; 
pulmonary; cardiovascular; abdominal; lymphatic; musculoskeletal/extremities; and neurological. Weight and height will be reported (height only reported during Screening). Abbreviated physical examinations will evaluate general appearance and the following body systems/organs: dermatological; pulmonary; cardiovascular; abdominal; and neurological.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 55 of 79 8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
A total of up to  30 subjects (5 subjects per treatment sequence) will be enrolled to ensure at 
least 24 evaluable subjects completed all three treatment periods of the study. A sample size 
of 24 evaluable subjects will provide at least 90 % power to exclude that LOXO-305 c auses 
more than a 10- msec QTc effect at clinically relevant plasma levels, as shown by the upper 
bound of the 2-sided 90% CI of the model- predicted QTc effect (∆∆QTc) at the observed 
geometric mean C max of LOXO-305 in the study. This power is estimated approximately 
using a paired  t-test. The calculation assumes a 1 -sided 5% significance level, a small 
underlying effect of LOXO-305 of 3 msec, and a standard deviation (SD) of the ΔQTc of 
8 msec for both LOXO-305 and placebo. The concentration- QTc analysis method is 
supported by Darpo et al14 and Ferber et al15, and is consistent with the experiences from 25 
recent TQT studies.  
8.1.1. Determination of Sample Size for Assay Sensitivity   
To demonstrate assay sensitivity with concentration -QTc analysis, it has to be shown that the 
ΔΔQTc of a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin exceeds 5 msec (ie, the lower bound of the 
2-sided 90% CI of the predicted QTc effect [ΔΔQTc] should exceed 5 msec). In a similarly 
designed, recent crossover study with 24 healthy subjects (on-file data, ERT), the standard error (SE) for the prediction of the QT effect of moxifloxacin based on the concentration- QTc 
analysis was 1.24 msec. The within -subject SD of ΔQT cF in the referred study was 5.4 msec 
based on the by-timepoint analysis. If the effect of moxifloxacin is assumed to be 10 msec, 
the SE of 1.24 msec corresponds to an effect size of (10 -5)/(1.24 ×sqrt[24])=  0.82, where the 
effect size is the effect assumed under the alternative hypothesis divided by the SD of the test variable. This value should be compared to the effect size of 0.62 required to guarantee a power of at least 90% in a paired t- test situation with a sample size of 24 evaluable subjects. 
In other words, based on this calculation, a power of at least 90% for 24 evaluable subjects will be obtained as long as the variability of the ΔQTc, as measured by its within-subject SD, does not exceed 7.1 msec (ie, 132% [= 0.82/0.62] of the 5.4 msec observed in the referred 
study assuming the ratio of effective sizes is consistent with inverse ratio of within -subject 
SD). The number also agrees with recent recommendations of the FDA, which propose at least 20 subjects. 
16 
Replacement subjects may be enrolled only if deemed necessary by the Sponsor. 
8.2. Analysis Pop ulations  
8.2.1. Study Populations  
The QT/QTc population will consist of all subjects who have received 1 dose of study drug 
(LOXO-305, moxifloxacin, and placebo) with measurements at baseline as well as 
on-treatment with at least 1 postdose timepoint with a ΔQTc value. The QT/QTc population 
will be used for the by- timepoint and categorical analysis of cardiodynamic ECG parameters.  
The safety population  will consist of all subjects who received 1  dose of study drug. 
Subjects will be classified into groups based on actual treatment received.  
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419690 Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20011 
Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 56 of 79 The PK population will consist of all subjects who received 1 dose of LOXO-305 or 
moxifloxacin, have at least 1 quantifiable plasma concentration  of LOXO -305 or its 
metabolites, or moxifloxacin . A subject may be excluded from the PK summary statistics and 
statistical analysis if the subject has an AE of vomiting that occurs at or before tmax. The 
impact of protocol deviations on the  PK population will be evaluated on a case-by- case basis.  
The PK/QTc population will consist of all subjects who are in both the QT/QTc and PK 
populations with at least 1 pair of postdose PK concentration and ΔQTc data from the same 
timepoint in at least 1 period as well as subjects in the QT/QTc population who received placebo. The PK/QTc population will be used for the concentration- QTc analysis and assay 
sensitivity. PK/QTc population will be defined for LOXO-305, for its metabolites, and for moxifloxacin. 
8.3. Cardiodynamic Analysis 
8.3.1. Baseline  
For all continuous ECG parameters from each period, baseline will be the average of the 
derived ECG intervals from the 3 ECG timepoints prior to treatment administration on Day 1, Day 12, and Day 23. For T-wave morphology and U-wave presence from each period, baseline includes findings observed in any of the replicates from the 3 timepoints prior to dosing on Day 1, Day 12, and Day 23. 
8.3.2. QT Correction Methods 
The QT and RR value for each beat will be used for HR correction. Twelve- lead ECGs will 
be extracted in up to 10 replicates from each nominal timepoint. The median va lue of each 
parameter from the set of evaluable beats in each extracted replicate will be calculated, and 
then the mean of all available medians (minimum 3 medians) from the nominal timepoint will be used as the subject’s reportable value at that timepoint . 
If the largest LS mean peak ∆∆HR after dosing with LOXO-305 is < 10 bpm , the HR 
correction method will be the Fridericia method  defined as:  
 QTcF (msec) = QT (msec)/[RR (msec)/1000]1/3 
If a substantial HR effect is observed, ie, the largest LS mean ∆∆HR larger than 1 0 bpm  in 
the by- time point analysis , additional QT correction methods may be explored. Since Holter 
recordings are not collected on Day -1, prior to treatment, additional QT correction method 
will be derived  from Day 1 of the placebo period during both the timepoints of supine rest 
(QTcS) and from all evaluable QT/RR pairs in  the 24 -h recording (QTcI). These data will be 
used to obtain RR interval (HR) and QT data to enable derivation of QTcS, and QTcI, as follows. 
 An individualized HR- corrected QT interval (QTcS) will be calculated from QT/RR 
data obtained at supine resting timepoints on Day 1 of the placebo period. Based on QT/RR pairs from all subjects, the QTcS correction coefficient will be derived from a linear mixed -effects model: log(QT
ij) = log(a i) + b1 i × log(RR ij) + b2 i× gender i + b3 i× 
log(RR ij) × gender i with gender included as a fixed effect for both intercept and slope, 
and subject included as a random effect for both intercept and slope. The coefficient 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419690 Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20011 
Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 57 of 79 of log(RR) for each subject, b i =b1 i+ b3 i × gender i, will then be used to calculate 
QTcS for each subject as follows: QTcS = QT/RRbi.  
 An optimized HR- corrected QT interval (QTcI) will be derived from a broader range 
of HRs by using all QT/RR data on Day 1 of the placebo period. The Q T/RR pairs 
from each subject will be used for that subject’s individual correction coefficient, 
which will be derived from a linear regression model: log(QT) = log(a) + b×log(RR). The coefficient of log(RR) for each subject, bi, will then be used to calcul ate QTcI for 
that subject as follows: QTcI = QT/RRbi.  
For QTcS and QTcI, the individual correction coefficients, bi, will be listed and also summarized in a table using arithmetic mean, SE, number of subjects, and 90% CI (based on t-distribution).  
The meth od that removes the HR dependence of the QT interval most efficiently will be 
chosen as primary correction method. 
8.3.3. Evaluation for QT- RR Correction Methods  
In case a substantial HR effect is observed, defined as a largest ∆∆HR greater than 1 0 bpm, 
the rela tionship between QTc (QTcF and, if derived, QTcS [individual], and QTcI 
[optimized]) and RR interval will be investigated using on- treatment data ( LOXO-305, 
moxifloxacin, and placebo) by a linear regression model: QTc = c + d x RR. Mean QTc and 
RR values f rom all nominal time points (including predose) will be used. The RR coefficient 
for each subject, d
i, will then be used to calculate the average sum of squared slopes (SSS) for 
each of the different QT/RR correction methods. The correction method that res ults in the 
average on -treatment slope closest to 0 (the smallest average SSS, as described by Tornøe et 
al 201117) for LOXO-305  and placebo will be deemed the most appropriate HR correction 
method. If different methods show similar SSS values on placebo as on LOXO-305, priority in the choice will be given to the placebo results. In addition, a scatter plot and quantile plot of QTc (QTcF, QTcS, and QTcI) and RR intervals by treatment with regression line and a 
linear mixed -effects line (90% CI), respectively, will also be given.  
8.3.4. Concentration- QTc Analysis (Primary Analysis)  
The relationship between LOXO-305 plasma concentrations a nd change from baseline QTc 
(ΔQTcF or ΔQTc corrected with the HR correction method chosen as primary if a substantial 
HR effect is observed ) will be quantified using a linear mixed-effects modeling approach. 
The model will include ΔQTc as the dependent variable, LOXO -305 plasma concentrations 
as the explanatory variate (0 for placebo), centered baseline QTc (ie, baseline QTcF for individual subject minus the population mean baseline QTc for all subjects in the same treatment period) as an additional covariate, treatment (active = 1 or placebo = 0) and time (ie, nominal postdose timepoint) as fixed effects, and random effects on the intercept and slope per subject.
18 In addition, if there are  significant concentrations of LOXO- 305 metabolites, 
their concentrations/QTc relationship may be explored (exploratory metabolite profiling has shown that unchanged LOXO-305 is the major drug-related component in human plasma).
 
The degrees of freedom of estimates will be determined by the Kenward -Roger method. 
From the model, the slope (ie, the regression parameter for LOXO -305 concentrations) and 
the treatment effect -specific intercept (defined as the difference between active and placebo) 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419690 Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20011 
Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 58 of 79 will be estimated together with the 2- sided 90% CI. The estimates for the time effect will be 
reported with degrees of freedom and SE.  
The geometric mean of the individual C max values for subjects in the active dose group will 
be determined. The predicted effect and its 2- sided 90% CI for ΔΔQTc (ie, slope estimate × 
concentration + treatment effect -specific intercept) at this geometric mean C max of 
LOXO-305 will be obtained. If the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI of the predicted effect 
of ΔΔQTc at clinically relevant plasma levels of LOXO -305 is below 10 msec, it will be 
concluded that LOXO -305 does not cause clinically relevant QTc prolongation within the 
observed plasma concentration ranges. 
To evaluate the adequacy of model fit with respect to the assumption of line arity, the 
observed ΔQTc values adjusted by population time effect estimated from the model will be 
used. These individual placebo- adjusted ΔQTc i,k (ΔΔQTc i,k) values equal the observed 
individual ΔQTc i,k for subject ‘i’ administered with active drug or placebo at timepoint ‘k’ 
minus the estimated population mean placebo effect at timepoint k (ie, time effect). A quantile plot, ie, plot of the quantiles (deciles) of observed drug concentrations and the mean 
placebo -adjusted ΔQTc (ΔΔQTc) and 90% CI at the median concentration within each decile, 
will be given. The regression line presenting the model- predicted ΔΔQTc (as described by 
Tornøe et al
17) will be added to evaluate the fit of a linear model and visualize the 
concentration -response relationship. Additional exploratory analysis (via graphical displays 
and/or model fitting) will include assessing for a delayed effect (hysteresi s) and the 
justification for the choice of the pharmacodynamic model (linear versus nonlinear). 
8.3.4.1. Investigation of Hysteresis  
Hysteresis will be assessed based on joint graphical displays of the least squares (LS) mean 
ΔΔQTc at each postdose timepoint from the by- timepoint analysis and the mean 
concentrations of LOXO-305 at the same timepoints. In addition, hysteresis plots will be given for LS mean ΔΔQTc from the by- timepoint analysis and the mean concentrations. If a 
QT effect > 10 msec (ie, the largest LS mean ΔΔQTc >  10 msec) cannot be excluded in the 
by-timepoint analysis, and if the difference (delay) between the time to rea ch the peak QTc 
effect (∆ΔQTc) and peak plasma concentrations (t
max) is larger than 1 hour, other 
concentration -QTc models, such as a model with an effect compartment, may be explored. 
With the provision stated above, hysteresis will be assumed if the curv e of the hysteresis plot 
shows a counterclockwise loop. A significant treatment effect -specific intercept may also be 
indicative of hysteresis or model misspecification, if it cannot be explained by a nonlinear relationship.  
8.3.4.2. Appropriateness of a Linear Mod el 
To assess the appropriateness of a linear model, normal quantile- quantile (Q -Q) plots for the 
standardized residuals and the random effects; scatter plots of standardized residuals versus concentration, fitted values, and centered baseline QTc; and box plots of standardized residuals versus nominal time and active treatment will be produced, in addition to the quantile plot described above. Among these plots, the scatter plots of standardized residuals versus concentration and versus centered baseline QT c will also include the locally weighted 
scatter plot smoothing
19 lines with optimal smoothing parameters selected by the Akaike 
information criterion with a correction20. A scatter plot of observed concentration and ΔQTc 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8419690 Protocol Reference:  LOXO- BTK-20011 
Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 59 of 79 with a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) line with 90% CI and a linear 
regression line will also be provided to check the assumption of a linear concentration- QTc 
relationship. If there is an  indication that a linear model is inappropriate, additional models 
may be fitted, specifically an E max model. The concentration- QTc analysis will then be 
repeated for the model found to best accommodate the nonlinearity detected.  
8.3.5. Assay Sensitivity  
Assay sensitivity will be demonstrated by similar concentration -QTc analysis of 
moxifloxacin data. If the slope of the concentration- QTc (∆QTc) for moxifloxacin is 
statistically significant at 10% level for 2 -sided test and the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% 
CI of the predicted effect of ΔΔQTc is above 5 msec at the geometric mean C max for 
moxifloxacin, assay sensitivity will be deemed to have been demonstrated. 
8.3.6. By-time point  Analysis (Secondary Analysis)  
The analysis for QTc will be based on a linear mixed -effects model with ΔQTc (ΔQTcF, or 
ΔQTc corrected per the HR correction method chosen as primary if a substantial HR effect is 
observed) as the dependent variable, period, sequence, time ( ie, nominal postdose timepoint), 
treatment (LOXO -305, moxifloxacin and placebo), and time-by- treatment interaction as fixed 
effects, and baseline QTc as a covariate.  An unstructured covariance matrix will be specified 
for the repeated measures at postdose timepoints for subject within treatment period . If the 
model with unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, other covariance matrix such as compound symmetry and autoregressive will be considered. The model will also include a subject-specific random effect. If the fixed effects for period and/or sequence should prove to be nonsignificant (that is, if the p-value > 0.1), these effects may be removed from the model and the analysis will be repeat ed without those covariates. From this analysis, the LS mean, 
SE, and 2- sided 90% CI will be calculated for the contrast “LOXO -305 versus placebo” at 
each postdose timepoint, separately.  
For HR, PR, QRS, and QTc intervals with the methods not selected as p rimary , the analysis 
will be based on the change from baseline post- dosing values (ΔHR, ΔPR, ΔQRS, and 
ΔQTc). The same (by-timepoint analysis) model will be used as described above for QTc. The LS mean, SE, and 2- sided 90% CI from the statistical modeling for both change from 
baseline and placebo -corrected change from baseline values will be listed in the tables and 
graphically displayed.  
8.3.7. Categorical Analysis 
The analysis results for categorical outliers will be based on treatment -emergent events (ie, 
new f indings compared to baseline); T-wave morphology and presence of U- waves will be 
summarized in frequency tables with counts percentages for both number of subjects and number of timepoints. For categorical outliers, the number (percentage) of subjects as w ell as 
time points who had increases in absolute treatment- emergent QTc (QTcF, and QTcS and 
QTcI if derived) values > 450 and ≤  480 msec, > 480 and ≤  500 msec, or > 500 msec, and 
changes from predose baseline of > 30 and ≤  60 msec, or > 60 msec; increase i n PR from 
predose baseline > 25% to a PR> 200 msec; increase in QRS from predose baseline > 25% to 
a QRS >  120 msec; decrease in HR from predose baseline > 25% to a HR <  50 bpm; and 
increase in HR from predose baseline > 25% to a HR > 100 bpm will be determined. For T-wave morphology and U- wave presence, treatment -emergent changes will be assessed, ie,

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 60 of 79 changes not present at baseline. For each category of T -wave morphology and of U- waves, 
the category will be deemed as present if observed in any replicates at the timepoint.  
8.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Blood samples for the analysis of concentrations of LOXO -305 in plasma will be collected 
for 96 hours after administration of LOXO -305 (Treatment A) and LOXO-305 matched 
placebo (Treatment B) . Blood samples for t he analysis of concentrations of moxifloxacin in 
plasma will be collected for   (Treatment C). 
Blood samples from Treatment A will be analyzed for concentration s of LOXO-305 in 
plasma through 96 hours after administration of LOXO -305. Blood s amples from Treatment 
B will be analyzed for concentrations of LOXO-305 in plasma only at the single timepoint 
taken 2 hours after administration of LOXO -305 matched placebo . Blood samples from 
Treatment C will be analyzed for  concentrations of moxifloxacin in plasma through  
.  
Whenever possible, the following PK parameters will be calculated for each subject, based on the plasma concentrations of LOXO-305 (as appropriate): 
• area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from hour 0 to 24 hours postdose 
(AUC
0-24) 
• AUC from hour  0 to the last measurable concentration  (AUC 0-t) 
• AUC from hour 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-inf) 
• percentage extrapolation for AUC 0-inf (%AUC extrap) 
• apparent systemic clearance (CL/F)  
• Cmax 
• mean residence time (MRT)  
• apparent plasma terminal elimination half -life (t ½) wherever possible, where t 1/2 = 
natural log (2)/ λZ 
• time to maximum observed plasma concentration (t max) 
• apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λ Z) 
• apparent volume of distribution at terminal phase (V z/F) 
Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed using commercial software such as Phoenix™ 
WinNonlin® Version  8.1 or higher (Certara USA Inc.).  
Other parameters may be added as appropriate. Final  PK parameters reported will be detailed 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will use actual times as recorded on the eCRF. All statistical 
analyses will be performed using SAS Version  9.4 or greater. More details on the analyses 
will be included in the SAP.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 69 of 79 Appendix  1: Adverse Ev ent Reporting  
Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE; or adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
experienced by a patient or healthy adult subject, whether or not considered drug-related by the Investigator (or designee). A treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE that 
starts on or after the first administration of study drug. 
The following are all AEs: 
• unfavorable changes in general condition 
• subjective or objective signs/symptoms 
• concomitant dise ases or accidents  
• clinically significant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject 
during a clinical study  
Adverse events comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective disease symptoms (including laboratory abnormalities that are deemed clinically significant by the Investigator [or designee]), and accidents observed in the context of a clinical trial, irrespective of a possible causal relationship with the administration of the trial substance.  
Categorization of Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs will be categorized based on the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as follows:  
• Grade  1 Mild:  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observa tions only; intervention not indicated  
• Grade  2 Moderate:  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*  
• Grade  3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening:  
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**  
• Grade  4 Life -threatening consequences:  An event that puts the subject at 
immediate risk of death  
• Grade  5: Death related to AE  
Note: Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed within the CTCAE with fewer than 
5 options for grade selection. Grade 5 (death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries, or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing, and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

Protocol Version  1.0, 30 November 2020 Page 70 of 79 The Investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study drug using a 2-category system according to the following guidelines: 
• NOT RELATED = The time course between the administration of investigational product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and another cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, comorbidities) is suspected  
• RELATED = The time course between administration of investigational product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal r elationship 
and no other cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, comorbidities) can be identified  
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by the drug. 
Pregnancy 
As information is available, a pregnancy (including pregnancy in female partners of male subjects) diagnosed through End of Study (EOS) or Early Termination (ET; if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow-up phone call)
 and for up to 
90 days after study drug administration on Day 23 (or last administration of study drug if subject terminates from the study early) should be reported by the Investigator (or designee) via email to Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative within 24 hours of being notified. Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative will then forward the Pregnancy Form to the Investigator (or designee) for completion. 
email: SAEIntake@Covance.com 
A subject becoming pregnant while on s tudy drug will immediately be withdrawn from the 
study and ET study procedures will be performed. The subject or partner should be followed by the Investigator (or designee) until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator (or designee) should notify Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator (or designee) will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a serious adverse event (SAE; ie, 
postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator (or designee) should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
Male subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator (or designee) immediately if they 
discover their sexual partner is pregnant. In this instance, the partner must provide written consent before pregnancy information can be collec ted. When a Clinical Research Unit 
(CRU) becomes aware that the female partner of a male subject is pregnant, they are to contact the Investigator (or designee) immediately (within 24  hours of the CRU staff 
becoming aware of the event) in addition to notifying Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative via email.  
All pregnancies should be recorded on the AE electronic Case Report Form (eCRF; as appropriate), in addition to completion of the required pregnancy forms. If the Investigator (or desi gnee) suspects that a pregnancy was the result of an interaction between the study

should also be captured as a separate AE.  
Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An S AE by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) definition is any adverse drug 
experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience (ie, one that places the subject, in the 
view of the Investigator [or designee], at immediate risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• An important medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent 1 of the above outcomes 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardi ze the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is considered ‘unexpected’ if the event is not list ed 
in the Reference Safety Information section of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or if it is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed for an unapproved investigational medicinal product (IMP). 
Reporting 
The FDA -reportable AEs are AEs that are associated with the use of the drug and represent 
events that are assessed as serious, related, and unexpected. The FDA -reportable AEs will be 
reported by the CRU to the Sponsor and the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB). Final determination of whether an event represents a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) will be the responsibility of the Sponsor.  
Within 24 hours of when an AE that is potentially FDA- reportable is first recognized or 
reported, and within 24 hours of any SAE ( regardless of whether the event is assessed as 
related or unrelated to study drug) being first recognized or reported, Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative will be notified by the Investigator (or designee) in writing using the following email address:  
email: SAEIntake@Covance.com 
To report the SAE, the completed report form should be sent by email to Covance or the Sponsor’s Clinical Safety Representative within 24 hours of awareness. Incoming reports are

Form are provided in the Study Manual. 
The IRB will be notified of any FDA- reportable AE within the timeframe required by the 
IRB. The IRB Serious and Unexpected Adverse Experience Submission Form will be 
completed and submitted with the copy of the written confirmation or summary of the AE.

 c. Height collected at Screening only; BMI calculated based on Screening height. 
d. A complete physical examination will be performed at Check-in (Day  -1). An abbreviated physical examination will be performed at EOT (Day 33) or at ET.  
e. Standard safety 12-lead ECGs will be obtained at Screening and Check -in (Day  -1), and at the following times related to administration of each treatment on Days 1, 12, and 23: predose, and 
1, 2, 4, 6, 24,  48, 72,  96, and 240  hours  postdose  (for Treatment Period 3, 240 hours postdose is EOT [Day 33] or ET). Standard safety 12- lead ECGs will be collected after the subject has 
rested in the supine position for at least 10  minutes. When scheduled at the same time as PK blood draws, standard safety 12- lead ECGs will be obtained prior to and as close as possible to 
having blood drawn. The allowed sampling window for standard safety 12-lead ECGs is ± 30 minutes from the nominal timepoint for all postdose standard safety 12- lead ECGs and no less 
than 10  minutes prior to dosing for predose standard safety 12- lead ECGs.  
f. Vital sign measurements (supine BP and pulse rate) will be obtained at Screening, Check-in (Day  -1), and at the following times related to administration of each treatment on Days 1, 12, 
and 23: predose, and 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 96 , and 240 hours  postdose (for Treatment Period 3, 240 hours postdose is EOT [Day 33] or ET). Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured using 
the same arm for each reading after the subject has been supine for at least 5  minutes. When scheduled at the same time as PK blood draws, vital sign measurements should be carried out 
prior to and as close as possible to having blood drawn. The allowed sampling window for vital sign measurements is ±  30 minutes from the nominal timepoint for all postdose vital sign 
measurements and no less than 10 minutes prior to dosing for predose vital sign measurements.  
g. Respiratory rate and body temperature will be obtained at Screening, Check-in (Day -1), predose on Days 1, 12, and 23, and at EOT (Day 33) or ET.  
h. Oxygen saturation will be measured via pulse oximetry at Screening, Check-in (Day -1), predose on Days 1, 12, and 23, and at EOT (Day 33, 240 hours postdose on Day 23) or ET. The 
allowed sampling window for oxygen saturation measurements is ±  30 minutes from the nominal timepoint for all postdose oxygen saturation measurements and no less than 10  minutes 
prior to dosing for predose oxygen saturation measurements.  
i. A HDYF? inquiry will be performed at Screening (after the ICF is signed), at Check-in (Day -1), at each postdose vital sign measurement, and at an appropriate time for all other days.  
j. Adverse events and SAEs will be collected beginning at informed consent. Adverse events will be recorded throughout the study  (ie, from signing of the ICF until EOS, or until ET if the 
subject discontinues from the study and does not  complete a follow -up phone call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the 
event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by  the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the 
ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed by the Investigator [or designee]) as related to study procedures, or if the event occurs after study drug administration on 
Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug are to be recorded. All SAEs that develop from 
the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up phone call) are to be reported.  
k. Treatment A (90 0 mg LOXO-305), Treatment B (placebo to match 900 mg LOXO-305), and Treatment C (400  mg moxifloxacin) will be administered in accordance wit h the randomization 
scheme assigned to each subject, with each treatment administered on either Days 1, 12, or 23.

m. Subjects
 will be required to lie quietly in a supine position with minimal movement and minimal exposure to noise and other e nvironmenta l stimuli (ie, TV, loud radio, interactions with other 
subjects, etc.) for at least 10  minutes before and 5 minutes during the cardiodynamic ECG extraction. Subjects will remain lying down or sitting and awake for the first 7 hours of the 24-hour 
postdose cardiodynamic ECG monitoring period. Holter monitors will be placed on subjects approximately 1.5  hours prior to dosing.  
n. Cardiodynamic sampling (Holter monitor ECG extraction) will be collected at the following times related to dosing: 45, 30, and 15  minu tes predose and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 
8.5, 12, and 24  hours postdose.  A light meal will be provided immediately following completion of the cardiodynamic ECG recording at the 6-hour timepoint and a full meal will be provided 
immediately  after the 12-hour postdose timepoints. A snack can also be given just after the 8.5-hour postdose timepoint. Meals and snacks must be scheduled to be completed at least

or on the day of ET.  At ET or the day before EOT (Day 32), subjects are not required to be fasted prior to clinical laboratory evaluations.  
p. Testing for COVID-19 will be conducted at a minimum at Screening and Check- in (Day -1). Testing for COVID-19 may also  be conducted periodically during the subject’s CRU 
confinement, at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee). Tests will be performed by rapid polymerase chain reaction or equivalent.  
q. Urine drug screen for drugs of abuse (including cotinine ) and al cohol screen  (urine or breath).   
r. Prior and concomitant medication administration will be recorded beginning at informed consent. In addition, all Investigator-approved prescription and over-the- counter medications taken 
by a subject within 14 days or 5 hal f-lives (if known), whichever is longer, prior to Day 1 will be recorded on the subject’s electronic CRF.

u. End of Treatment is defined as when the subject is released from the CRU following completion of all assessments through EOT (Day 33). Early Termination is defined as when the subject 
is released f rom the CRU if the subject terminates the study early. Vital sign measurements, standard safety ECG, and abbreviated physical  examination results are to be available for review 
by the Investigator (or designee) prior to subject release from the CRU on Day 33 (EOT) or ET. Clinical laboratory results (for clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and UA) and serum pregnancy test results (female subjects only) are to be available for review by the Investigator (or designee) prior to  subject release from the  CRU at the EOT visit and prior to subject 
release from the CRU at the ET visit, if available.  
v. To be conducted 7 days (±  2 days) following EOT (Day 33) or ET. End of Study is defined as when the subject is contacted by the CRU for a follow -up phone call 7  days (±  2 days) after the 
EOT visit or ET visit to determine if any SAE or study drug-related AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit. All subjects who received study drug (including subjects who are terminate d 
early) will receive a follow -up phone call .

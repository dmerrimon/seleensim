Title:   A Phase 1b /2Study Assessing Safety and Anti -tumor Activity of AMG 820 in Combination 
with Pembrolizumab in Select Advanced Solid Tumors
Study Phase:   1b/2  
Indication:   Colorectal cancer ( CRC ),pancreatic cancer and non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC ),and other indications dependent on emerging data
Hypotheses:
AMG 820 in combination with pembrolizumab is safe and well tolerated when administered in 
subjects with select advanced solid tumors
AMG 820 can enhance the anti -tumor activity observed with pembrolizumab alone and/or 
overcome lack of response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in subjects with select advanced 
solid tumors
Primary Objective:
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 820 a dministered in combination with 
pembrolizumab in subjects with select advanced solid tumors
Evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of AMG 820 and pembrolizumab combination as 
per irRECIST in subjects with select advanced solid tumors
Secondary Objective (s):  
Evaluate the anti -tumor activity of AMG 820 and pembrolizumab combination in select 
advanced solid tumors by assessing
oORR per RECIST 1.1
otime to response (TTR), duration of response (DOR), and time to progression (TTP) 
oprogression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 6 and 12 months
Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG 820 after intravenous (IV) infusion 
administration of AMG 820 in combination with pembrolizumab
Evaluate the relationship between the immune infiltrate status in pre- study  tumor biopsies vs. 
clinical response
Primary Endpoint:   
Dose limiting toxicities (DLT), treatment- emergent adverse events, treatment -related adverse 
events and clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical
laborator y tests
ORRas per irRECIST in subjects treated at the recommended combination dose
Secondary Endpoint(s):
Objective response ( OR)as per RECIST 1.1; TTR, DOR and TTP ; OS and PFS at 6 and 
12months
PK parameters for AMG 820 including, but not limited to, maximum observed concentration 
(Cmax)andminimum observed concentration (C min).In addition, area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC) and, if feasible, half -life (t 1/2)for AMG 820.
CD4,CD8 & CD68 cells number sin fresh pre -treatment bi opsies
Study Design:   This is a multi -center Phase 1b/2 study testing the combination of AMG 820 and 
pembrolizumab in subjects with select advanced solid tumors . Phase 1b of the study (part 1) will 
have a 6+3 design aimed at assessing the safety of the selected starting dose of AMG 820 in 
combination with pe mbrolizumab . Phase 2 of the study (part 2) willfurther evaluate safety and
test whether AM G820 can enhance the anti -tumor activity observed historically with

CONFIDENTIA Lpembrolizumab alone and/or overcome lac k of response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
subjects with select solid tumors .
Part 1 : Up to 3 cohorts will be evaluated for safety in Part 1. The initial cohort will treat subjects 
who have select advanced solid tumors with 1400 mg AMG 820 plus 200mgpembrolizumab 
every three weeks ( Q3W)using a 6+3 design. 
If 0 or 1 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) then the 
dose combination will be determined to be tolerable and Part 2 initiated . The study Part 1 
DLT per iod is 21 days .
If 2 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a DLT then 3 additional evaluable subjects 
will be enrolled. 
If 3 or more of the evaluable subjects experience a DLT (eg, 33% or higher with 9 evaluable 
subjects) then the dose combinatio n will be determined to be non-tolerable and a second 
Part 1 cohort will be enrolled to test a decreased dose of AMG 820 in combination with 
200mgpembrolizumab. Further degree of dose modification and/or schedule of 
administration will be decided based on analysis of emerging safety and PK data.
Part 2 : The evaluation of safety and efficacy in this part will include 6 -9 subjects from Part 1 who
have been treated with the recommended combination dose, and will enroll additional subjects 
with select solid tumors up to 185 subjects overall. Part 2 will have 5groups , which will be 
evaluated using a Simon two -stage design .Analy sis of data in Part 2 will be done separately for 
each group (Group 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b).
Group 1 will enroll up to 43 advanced MMR -proficient CRC subjects who are naïve to 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R therapies . Eighteen ( 18)subjects will be enrolled during the 
first stage and treated with the AMG 820 plus pembrolizumab combination. If only 2 or fewer 
subjects have an objective response per irRECIST then further enrollment may  be 
discontinued ;otherwise ,enrollment up to 43 subjects will occur.
Group 2 will enroll up to 29 advanced pancreatic cancer subjec ts who are naïve to 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R therapies . Ten ( 10)subjects will be e nrolled during the first 
stage and treated with the AMG 820plus pembrolizumab combination. If nosubjects have 
an objective response per irRECIST then further enrollment may  be discontinued ;otherwise ,
enrollment up to 29 subjects will occur.
Group 3 will enroll up to 55 advanced NSCLC subjects with low (<50%) tumor 
PD-L1-expression who are naïve toanti-PD-1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R agents .  
Nineteen (19)subjects will be enrolled first during the first s tage and treated with the 
AMG 820 plus pembrolizumab combination. If 3 or fewer subjects have an objective 
response per irRECIST then further enrollment may be discontinued ;otherwise ,enrollment 
up to 55 subjects will occur.
Group 4will enroll up to 58 NSCLC subjects who have not responded to or have relapsed 
during monotherapy with anti -PD-1/PD -L1 agents , and are anti -CSF- 1/CSF -1R naïve. These 
subjects will be further distributed equally between two sub -groups (4a and 4b) depending on 
the  PD -L1 expre ssion in the tumor tissue: high ( ≥50%) and low (< 50%) expression . 
Ten(10)subjects per subgroup will be enrolled first , during the first stage. If no objective 
response per irRECIST is seen in either of the subgroups then further enrollment may be 
discontinued ;otherwise, enrollment up to 58 subjects will occur.
Sample Size:   
It is anticipated that 67to 197subjects will be enrolled overall in this study. 
Part 1 will enroll 6 to 18 evaluable subjects. The sample size in Part 1 is based on practical 
consideration, and it is consistent with conventional oncology studies with the objective to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of a treatment combination.  W ith 6 subjects in a cohort, there 
is a 47 -91% pr obability of observing at least one DLT if the true DLT rate is 10 -33%.

CONFIDENTIA LPart 2 evaluation of efficacy will include at least 6 subjects from part 1 who have been treated 
with the recommended combination dose, and will enroll additional subjects with CRC , pancreatic 
cancer and NSCLC up to a maximum of 185subjects overall. The sample size in each group 
evaluated in Part 2 is chosen to test whether AM G 820 can enhance the anti -tumor activity 
observed historically with pembrolizumab alone and/or overcome lack of response to 
pembrolizumab monotherapy. Other indications may be inc luded dependent on emerging data.
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria:   
Subjects ≥ 18 years of age with pathologically documented, definitively diagnosed, advanced 
select solid tumors that are refractory  to standard treatment , or the subjects have been intolerant 
to or refuse the standard treatment (certain prior therapies are restricted as per the study design) 
with no anti-tumor therapy (chemotherapy, antibody the rapy, molecular targeted therapy,
investigational agent) within 28 day s prior to start of treatment and no active autoimmune 
disease . Once consented to the study, subjects will undergo safety tests and provide a medical 
history to confirm they meet all requirements of the study.
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 4.1through Section 4.2.

andAMG 820
The c-fms receptor (also known as M -CSF receptor [M-CSFR] or CSF -1 receptor 
[CSF -1R]), belongs to the class III receptor tyrosine kinase family that includes PDGFR 
α and β, VEGFR1, R2 and R3, Flt3 and c-kit (van der Geer et al, 1994; 
Blume- Jensen etal,2001 ). Expression of c-fmsis primarily restricted to cells of the 
myelomonocytic lineage (including monocytes, tissue macrophages, microglial cells and 
osteoclasts), hematopoietic precursors and trophoblasts ( Dai et al, 2002; 
Pixley etal,2004 ). The colony stimulating factor -1 (CSF -1, also known as macrophage 
stimulating factor [M -CSF]) seems to be the main ligand for CSF -1R

CONFIDENT IAL(VanWesenbeeck et al, 2005; Wiktor-Jedrzejczak et al,1990), while the relevance of 
IL-34, a second pos sible ligand  ( Lin et al, 2008 ), is yet to be fully elucidated. CSF-1 is 
expressed both as a membrane -bound and a soluble cytokine ( Pixley et al, 2004). It 
influences the survival, proliferation, differentiation, chemotaxis and activation of 
macrophages and their precursors ( Bourette et al, 2000; Cecchini et al, 1994, 
Hamilton, 1997 ).
All normal tissues are populated with macrophages, which are part of the innate immune 
system, recognizing, engulfing and destroying potential pathogens 
(Sasmono etal,2004) through the release of react ive-oxygen species and 
reactive- nitrogen metabolites ( Adams and Hamilton, 1984; Nathan et al, 1991 ). In 
addition, tissue macrophages contribute to both humoral and cell- mediated immune 
responses as antigen presenting cells. Conversion from a quiescent state to an 
immunologically active or microbicidal state can be induced by microbial products and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines including CSF -1,  IL -1, TNFα, IL -4, IL- 12, IL- 13, GM -CSF, 
IFNγ ( Bingle etal,2002; Pollard, 2004). Atthe tumor level, macrophages can represent 
a prominent component of the inflammatory infiltrate: tumor associated macrophages 
(TAMs) or tumor infiltrating macrophages (TIMs) ( Noy an d Pollard, 2014; 
Chanmee etal,2014, Pollard, 2004; Chen et al, 2005 ).
Over the past decade s, the mechanisms supporting the tumor promoting functions of 
TAMs have become increasingly clear ( Noy and Pollard, 2014; Colegio et al, 2014; 
Chanmee et al, 2014; Ribatti et al, 2007; Sica et al, 2006; Condeelis et al, 2006; 
Leek
etal, 2002 ) through their production of various pro -angiogenic factors 
(Bingle etal,2002; Mantovani et al, 1992 )such as proteases that degrade the tumor 
extracellular matrix thus aiding invasion and metastasis and mitogenic factors directly 
stimulatory to tum ors (Leek et al, 2002). In addition, CSF- 1 derived macrophages have 
been shown to be immunosuppressive via production of factors such as prostaglandins, 
indolamine 2,3 dioxygenase, nitric oxide, IL -10, and TGF -β (Bronte et al, 2001; 
MacMicking et al, 1997 ). CSF-1 serum levels as well as TAMs number have been 
associated in different ways with prognosis in cancer depending on various factors 
including tumor type and TAM content in the primary tumor vs metastases 
(NoyandPollard, 2014; Chanmee et al, 2014; Lewis et al, 2006; Funada et al, 2003; 
Ohno et al, 2003; Caruso et al, 1999 ). However, in all preclinical tumor models tested to 
date (using both human tumor xenograft and syngeneic models) decrease of TAM 
number and/or their function/survival through tar geting CSF -1R axis ( Colegio et al, 2014;

CONFIDENT IALNowicki et al, 1996; Lin et al, 2001; Aharinejad et al, 2004, Zeisberger et al, 2006; 
Luo et al, 2006 ) resulted always in inhibition of tumor growth, never tumor progression. 
2.1.2 PD-1 AND PD-L1 inhibitors
Programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) is a negative co stimulatory receptor expressed 
primarily on the surface of activated T cells. Binding of the ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, to 
the PD -1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. 
Upregulat ion of PD -1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway 
can contribute to inhibition of active T cell immune surveillance of tumors
(PhilipsandAtkins, 2015; Swaika et al, 2015 ). 
To date, the two leading PD -1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab, have been 
approved in advanced, previously treated melanoma and non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Especially in the NSCLC setting, PD -L1 tumor expression seems to indicate 
an increase likelihood of responding to anti -PD-1 agents, and companion diagnostic kits 
for this biomarker have been developed 
(http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm466413.htm ;
Keytruda®USPI, 2015
).
2.1.3 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common forms of cancer worldwide. CRC 
has the third highest cancer incidence and rate of death in the USA for men and women, 
although the related numbers have been steadily d eclining in the past decades
(Gilletal, 2014 ).Among patients already diagnosed with CRC, approximatel y one -fifth 
present with synchronous metastasis, and half of the remaining patients will develop 
subsequent metastases. In the treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC) several cytotoxic 
agents have demonstrated efficacy, including 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), folinic acid, 
irinotecan, oxaliplatin and capecitabine. These drugs are commonly combined in 
various regimens, and can be further partnered with monoclonal antibodies targeting 
VEGF or EGFR signaling. Recently, two additional therapeutic options have gained 
approval. The clinical efficacy and safety of STIVARGA (regorafenib), a kinase inhibitor, 
were evaluated in an international, randomized (2:1), placebo -controlled trial in 
previously -treated 760 mCRC patients (Grothey et al, 2013) . The major efficacy 
outcom e measure was OS which showed significant, although modest, improvement 
(6.4 vs 5mo), and no effect on PFS nor ORR: 2mo vs 1.7mo, and 1% vs 4%, 
respectively (Stivarg aUSPI, 2012 ). LONSURF is a combination of trifluridine (a 
nucleoside metabolic inhibitor), and tipiracil (a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor)

CONFIDENT IAL(LONSURF USPI, 2015 ). Its clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated in a similar 
setting (800 patients with previously treated mCRC). A statistically significant 
improvement in overall sur vival (7.1 vs 5.3mo) and progression- free survival were 
demonstrated.  Evidently, for most patients with mCRC available treatment is pal liative 
rather than curative , with an overall 5 -year s urvival of approximately 10% . 
Subsequently, additional options ar e needed for patients who have disease progression 
despite available standard therapies, since many of them maintain good performance 
status and might be candidates for further treatments.
In the light of recent advances in the immunotherapeutics space, th e potential 
significance of the immune system in tumor biology has been investigated for CRC as 
well(Kroemer et al, 2015; Markman and Shiao, 2015 ).  The presence of tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes —especially CD8  + lymphocytes —in the tumor microenvironment, as well as 
regional lymph nodes, has been linked to better prognosis . Also, increased infiltration of 
specific regions of the CRC tumors by cyto toxic memory T lymphocytes 
(CD8+ CD45RO +T cells) was highly correlated with reduced risk of recurrence o f CRC 
and better survival . The prognostic significance of T cells—unlike other inflammatory 
cells—argues that cancer immunotherapies modulating T cell responses could lead to 
improved survival. Nonetheless, there was an almost co mplete lack of response to 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1 agents in CRC patients, except when adm inistered in combination with 
bevacizumab +/ -FOLFOX (a ph1b study with MPDL3280A) , or in CRC patients with a 
deficit in mismatch repair genes (dMMR). A dMMR system is present in 10 –20% of 
patients with sporadic CRC and is associated with a favorable prognosis in early -stage 
disease. In contrast, dMMR occurs in only 3 –6% of pat ients with advanced CRC
(Llosa et al, 2015) .Recent findings have suggested that checkpoint inhibitors may have 
increased activi ty in dMMR tumors, since dMMR have several times as many somatic 
mutations a s proficient MMR tumors , and have prominent lymphocyte infiltrates , which 
are m ore likely to express PD -L1,  a hypothesis which was tested in a Phase II trial
(Leet al, 2015) . This study showed that MMR status may be a predictive biomarker for 
clinical benefit from checkpoint inhibition . Although immunotherapy in dMMR tumors 
holds great promise, the complete absence of response in patients with proficient MMR 
CRC—who represent the vast majority —highlights the ongoing need to understand why 
patients with conventional CRC lack robust responses to immunotherapy.

CONFIDENT IAL2.1.4 Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), representing 95% of pancreatic cancers, 
remains one of t he most lethal cancer types with an overall 5- year survival rate of less 
than 5 %, and a median survi val of less than 6 months . It is estimated that near 
40,000 people died of PDA in 2014, rendering it the fourth leading cause of 
cancer -related death in the USA (Cid-Aregui and Ju arez, 2015 ). Early -stage PDA is 
asymptomatic, while patients with symptoms are often diagnosed as advanced and 
metastatic disease when less than 15 % are sui table for surgical resection. Hence, 
chemotherapy is the only option for most patients. For the last two decades, 
gemcitabine has been the standard first -line drug, however with only modest survival 
benefits. While different gemcitabine based combinations have been investigated in a 
number of randomized trials, only very few showed some beneficial effects, like for 
example gemcitabine plus erlotinib or gemcitabine plus S -1
(Cid-Aregui and Ju arez, 2015) . Recently,  gemcitabine plus albumin bound -paclitaxel 
(nab-paclitaxel) as well as a regimen combining fluorouracil, irinotec an, oxaliplatin, and 
leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) have shown clear therapeutic advantage in advanced PDAC 
in phase IIItrials, over single agent gemcitabine. With the pending issue of their higher 
toxicities, these regimens now set the reference for ongoing an d future clinical studies in 
advanced PDAC. FOLFIRINOX showed significant improvement i n median overall 
survival (11.1 months vs. 6.8 months with gemcitabine) in patients with Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG) performance status 0-1. Progression -free 
survival was also improved, from 3.4 to 6.4 months. Definitive deterioration in the quality 
of life at 6 mo was observed in 31% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX and in 66% in the 
gemcitabine group. However, the toxicity associated with FOLFIRINOX is im portant, in 
particular grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression and fatigue . For nab- paclitaxel combined 
with gemcitabine the median overall survival improved to 8.5 mo from 6.7 mo with 
gemcitabine alone (p < 0.001). The 1 -year survival rate was 35% and 22%, respectively, 
and the 2 -year survival was 9% and 4%, respectively. ORR was 23% and 7%, 
respectively. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher, such as myelosuppression and 
peripheral neuropathy were however increased in the combined nab- paclitaxel plus 
gemcitabine arm(Cid-Aregui and Ju arez, 2015) .In addition to chemotherapies, a 
number of agents targeting signaling pathways in tumor or stroma cells are being 
investigated. Likewise, immunotherapies that target PDAC in various ways are the 
subject of a number of c linical trials (Cid-Aregui and Ju arez, 2015) .

CONFIDENT IALA heavy infiltration of CD4 and CD8+ T cells expressing programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) 
and smaller numbers of myeloid cells and regulatory T cells seen in the PDA tissues 
provided rationale for the clinical evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibition as a 
pancreatic cancer therapeutic strategy (Komura et al, 2015; Brahmer et al, 2012 ). 
However, anti -PD-1 agents have been unsuccessful when tested in a small number of 
patients with advanced stage PDA, suggesting that it may be necessary to address the 
immunosuppressive effects of other PD -1 ligands or block additional co -inhibitory 
pathways (Brahmer et al, 2012) . The PDA tissues appear also to be infiltrated by 
macrophages, especially M2 macrophages. In the recent years, line of evidence had 
tried to clarify how the monocytes were recruited and the mechanism by which they 
differentiate to macrophages. CSF/CSFR is a commonly accepted signaling pathway 
that associates with the process . Generally, the r egional microenvironment, which is 
featured by dense stroma infiltration, plays a decisive role in recruiting monocytes and 
modulating macrophage phenotype. Since different areas of a solid tumor may exhibit 
distinct microenvironment, TAMs differ in phenotype as well as function from one region 
to another. Typically, TAMs in the hypoxia region polarize to M2, while those within the 
normoxic regions tend to be M1- like(Colegio et al, 2014 ).  Recent reports suggested 
that the macrophage phenotype is also st age d ependent. For example, the 
anti-inflammation M1 -like macrophages, which usually locate in chronic pancreatitis 
where tumor occurs, gradually converted to M2 -like during tumor initiation and 
progression , reflecting the plasticity as well as heterogene ity of TAMs. As a support, 
pathological data revealed that M2 -like macrophages were more abundant in PDA 
samples than those diagno sed as chronic pancreatitis (Komura et al , 2015) . 
Consistently, further analysis showed that the M2 -like macrophages associated with 
lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, chemoresistance, and hence the survival of 
the PDA patients .Additional evidence of inflammatory features of PDA form findings of 
the significantly elevated levels of interleukin (IL) -6, IL-7, IL- 15, mon ocyte chemotac tic 
protein -1, and interferon-c- inducible protein -1 in the sera of PDAC patients. The g ene 
expression profile of CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ T cells was discernible between 
PDAC patients and healthy volunteers, and the differentially expressed genes were 
related to active inflammation. Intriguingly, PD -1 was significantly upregulated in the 
peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of PDAC patients. Correspondingly, the frequency of 
CD4+PD -1+ T cells was increased in the peripheral blood cells of PDAC patie nts, and 
this increase correlated to chemotherapy resistance. In conclusion, inflammatory 
conditions in both PDAC tissue and peripheral blood cells in PDAC patients appear to be

2.1.5 Non-Small Lung Cancer (NSLC)
Metastatic lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide with a 5 -year 
survival for advanced disease of less than 5% despite of a comprehensive therapeutic 
approach. In few tumor types with distinct molecular alterations, unprecedented benefits 
can be delivered by very specific molecular targeted therapies .For most patients with 
advanced NSCLC, platinum -based chemotherapy with or without maintenance therap y, 
and subsequently followed by second -line cytotoxic chemotherapy, is the standard 
treatment (median survival of approximately 1 year).  Second -line cytotoxic therapies (ie, 
docetaxel, pemetrexed and erlotinib) have only moderate efficacy and are associat ed
with significant toxicities .For this reason, strategies such as immunotherapy, which may 
have efficacy irrespective of histology or mutational status, are particularly attractive
(Minguet et al, 2015; Garon et al, 2015 ). Latest approvals (2015) of several 
immunotherapy agents reflect the scientific progress poised to shape further the patient 
outcomes in this indication (Garon et al, 2015; Romero, 2015 ). As such, anti –PD-1 and 
anti–PD-L1 antibodies have been shown to produce durable responses in cl inical trials in 
approximately 20% of patients with advanced non –small -cell lung cancer, even without 
selecting for PD -L1 tumor expression .  Pembrolizumab has been recently approved for 
the treatment of subjects with advanced (metastatic) NSCLC whose disea se has 
progressed after other treatments and have tumors that express PD -L1. In a phase 1

or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 week s or 10 mg per kilogram every 
2weeks) (Garon et al 2015 ).Among all the patients, the objective response rate was 
19.4%, and the median duration of response was 12.5 months. The median duration of 
progression -free survival was 3.7 months, and the median duration of overall survival 
was 12.0 months. Among all the patients with a PD -L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of 
at least 50%, median progression- free survival was 6.3 months, and the median overall 
survival was not reached. In a subgroup of  these patients (73/313 patients in the 
validation group with TPS of at least 50%), the response rate was 45.2%. Among the 
1143 screened patients, 824 had samples that could be evaluated by the clinical -trial 
assay, with a prevalence of 23.2% of patients with a PD -L1 TPS of at least 50%, 37.6% 
with a score of 1 to 49%, and 39.2% with a score of less than 1% by the clinical -trial

CONFIDENT IALNSCLC patie nts with PD -L1 TPS between 1 -49% and <1% was 16.5% and 10.7%, 
respectively (validation set). ORR values were similar in previously treated patients vs 
treatment naïve: 15.6% vs 19.2% (PD -L1 TPS between 1 -49%), and 9.1% vs 16.7% 
(PD-L1 TPS <1%) (Garon et al, 2015 ).
A recent sensitivity analysis of nivolumab, and pembrolizumab activity according to the 
tumor expression of PD -L1 (Carbognin et al, 2015 ) suggests a significant differential 
effect in terms of activity according to PD -L1 expression on tumor cells status, which 
translated into a higher ORR for PD -L1 positive adva nced tumors in comparison to 
PD-L1 negative tumors. W ith respect to disease setting, the analysis showed evidence 
of such effect for melanoma and NSCLC, and less for genitourinary cancers. 
Considering the PD -L1 expression cut -off, the difference in ORR between PD -L1 
positive and negative patients was significantly higher in studies adopting the cut -off of 
5%, with an absolute difference of 15.5% (95% CI 9.5– 21.4). No significant difference 
was seen for trials where the cut -off was 1% (p=0.108) (Carbognin et al, 2015 ). In two 
randomized phIII studies in squamous NSCLC (CheckMate 017) (Brahmer et al, 2015 ) 
and non- squamous NSCLC (CheckMate 057) (Borghaei et al, 2015 ) OPDIVO was 
evaluated again st docetaxel. Significant improvement was reported in both trials for OS 
(9.2 vs 6.2mo, and 12,2 vs 9.4mo, respectively). ORR in the CheckMate 057 study was 
19% in the OPDIVO arm vs 12% in the docetaxel arm. In the CheckMate 063 study , a 
phII, single arm study of OPDIVO in squamous NSCLC patients who had progressed 
after platinum based therapy and second line systemic chemotherapy, ORR was 15%, 
with 59% patients having responses of 6 months or longer (Rizvi et al, 2015 ).
2.2 AMG 820 Background
AMG 820 is a fully human IgG2 c-fms(CSF -1R) antagonistic antibody. This antibody 
binds to the first and second IgG regions of the extracellular domain of c-fmsand 
blocked CSF -1 induced proliferation of primary human bone marrow -derived monocytic 
cells in vitro with an IC 50of 15.8 pM. AMG 820 had no detectable agonistic activity in the 
in vitro proliferation assays. AMG 820 cross -reacts with cynomolgus monkey c-fmsas 
measured by binding to cynomolgus c-fmsexpressed on 2936E cells with a K d of 
29.7 pM and inhibiti on of CSF -
1-induced proliferation of primary bone marrow -derived 
monocytic cells from cynomolgus monkeys in vitro with an IC 50of 31.2 pM.  A maximal 
plateau level of CSF- 1 elevation (500 -1000 ng/mL) was observed in serum after a single 
IV dosing of 20 mg/ kg AMG 820 in normal cynomolgus monkeys. The increase of serum

information related to the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and 
formulation(s) .
2.2.1 AMG 820 Clinical Experience
In the first -in-human, open -label, dose -escalation study, 25 subjects with advanced solid 
tumors received AMG 820 at doses of 0.5 mg/kg every week ( QW)and 1.5, 3, 6, 10, and 
20 mg/kg every 2 weeks ( Q2W). The study was terminated after the dose -escalation 
part; the maximum administered dose was 20 mg/kg Q2 W AMG 820, and the MTD was 
not determined. Key adverse events reported in the study included DLT of grade 3 
bilateral deafness in 1 subject, as well as commonly -reported adverse events of 
periorbital edema (without clin ical sequelae) and AST increase (both noted in p reclinical 
studies). Exposure to AMG 820 was increased with increasing AMG 820 dose, and no 
marked (> 2 fold) accumulation was observed after rep eated -dose administrations. 
AMG820 mediated pharmacodynamic effects included increase in CSF -1 levels, 
reduct ion of macrophages number in the skin, and decrease in TRAP5b levels. No 
subjects tested positive for anti -AMG 820 binding antibodies. Per central assessment, 
8subjects (32%) had a best response of stable disease. Median of maximum 
percentage change from baseline in tumor volu me was 19.32% (range: -24.0% 
to104.8%).
Refer to the AMG 820 IBfor additional clinical experience information . For non -clinical 
toxicology information, refer to Section 5.3 of the AMG 820 IB .
2.2.2 AMG 820 Pharmacokinetics
AMG820 PK analysis was conducted for all 25 evaluable adult subjects with advanced 
solid tumors from the first -in-human study (20060347).  The initial study design was 
based on weekly IV infusions of AMG 820 at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg.  In 
subsequent higher dose cohorts, the dosing regimen was revised to IV infusion over a 
60-minute period Q2 W.  Escalation of AMG 820 dose was advanced through the 1.5, 3, 
6, 10, and 20 mg/kg levels.   After single intravenous infusion dosing, mean AMG 820 
Cmaxexposures were increased by approximately 13 -fold and AUC exposures were 
increased by approximately 24 -fold over a 13.3 -fold range (1.5 to 20 mg/kg) of dose 
levels.  Over a narrower dose range from 3 to 20 mg/kg (6.7 -fold), mean estimates of 
AUC increased by approx imately 8- fold.  At the 20 mg/kg Q2 W dose level, mean

the first dose.   AMG 820 accumulation in the systemic circulation was minimal (<2-fold) 
after repeated dose adminis tration .
2.2.3 AMG 820 Pharmacodynamics
Serum CSF- 1 levels were determined for several time points following each AMG 820 
dose for subjects in the 0.5- mg/kg QW  and 1.5- mg/kg t o 20-mg/kg Q2 W cohorts.  At 
0.5mg/kg QW  AMG 820, CSF -1 levels were observed to rise from baseline over 3 to 
5days following dosing before decreasing towards baseline.  At higher doses of 
AMG820 (1.5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg Q2 W AMG 820), CSF -1 levels were similarly 
increased after dosing and elevated CSF -1 levels were sustained for the remaind er of 
the dosing interval.  At 10 mg/kg Q2 W AMG 820, CSF- 1 levels appeared to reach a 
plateau after 3 weeks of exposure to AMG 820.  
Changes in serum IL-34 levels over time were assessed in all cohorts.  IL -34 levels did 
not demonstrate a dose- response relationship to AMG 820 administration.
2.2.4 AMG 820 Dose Rationale
In this study, AMG 820 will be administered at a fixed dose of 1400 mg in combination 
with 200 mg fixed dose of pembrolizumab as an intravenous infusion Q3W .
TheAMG 820 dose of 1400 mg Q3 W IV infusion is supported by AMG 820 PK and PD
(serum CSF -1 concentration) observed in the first -in-human FIH study (20060347).
Maximum concentrations (C max) are predicted to be within a range of observed C max 
exposures at AMG 820 dose levels that were safe and tolerated in the FIH study.  In 
addition, AMG 820 concentrations after IV infusion at 1400 mg are predicted to remain 
above concentrations associated with the observed maximum CSF- 1 response in the 
FIH study.
In the FIH study, subjects received AMG 820 Q2W by IV infusion at doses that ranged 
from 1.5 to 20 mg/kg, with body weights ranging from 44.4 to 159 kg.  Among all 
subjects, AMG 820 was determined to be safe and tolerated. A maximum tolerated 
dose level was not identified in the FIH study. 
A transiti on from weight -based dosi ng (mg/kg) to fixed dosing (mg) is supported by 
AMG820 PK in the FIH study.  In terms of clinical experience ,the 1400 mg AMG 820 
dose is clearly bracketed by observed exposures in the FIH study.  After accounting for 
body weights of subjects in the FIH study , the resulting increases in IV dose were from 
102 mg to 2260 mg.  Linear increases in the corresponding AMG 820 exposures

CONFIDENT IAL(Cmaxand C 336h) were observed for all subjects.  Predictions of AMG 820 exposure at 
1400 mg include:
The range of C max (at 1 hour, end of infusion) values observed in FIH subjects on
day 1 were 44.9 to 744 μg/mL. At 1400 mg IV, a C max of approximately 550 μg/mL 
was predicted from interpolation of C max versus dose.
The range of trough concentration (at 336 hours), C 336h, values observed in FIH 
subjects on day 1 were 1.23 to 231 μg/mL. At 1400 mg IV, a C 336h of 
approximately 150 μg/mL was predicted from interpolation of C 336h versus dose.
Importantly, a summary of C max and AUC exposures from the FIH study, no rmalized by 
dose, did not reveal an apparent trend over the rang e of body weights of subjects , 
providing support for a flat -based dose approach.
In addition, a population PK model developed from the FIH study was used to predict 
trough concentrations anticipated at the end of the proposed 3 week dosing interval.  
Based on population PK predictions, following Q3W  dosing of 1400 mg AMG 820, trough 
concentrations are predicted to remain above concentrations associated with maximum 
CSF-1 resp onse observed in the FIH study.
2.3 Risk A ssessment
There are no important identified risks for AMG 820.
Important potential risks for AMG 820 include increased extracellular matrix, infection, 
growth plate changes and immunogenicity.  Refer to the AMG 820 IB for additional risk
information.
No significant risks or drug -drug interactions with pembrolizumab are anticipated at the 
AMG 820 starting dose of 1400 mg in the proposed study.   Explored AMG 820 dose 
levels ranging from 0.5 mg/kg QW and 1.5mg/kg to 20 mg/kg Q2 W were genera lly 
well-tolerated in the FIH study. Approximately 25 subjects have received AMG 820.  
Treatment -related toxicities have been mild or moderate in most patients, and the most 
common toxicities are transient aspartate aminotransferase increase and periorbit al 
edema.  No subjects have developed treatment emergent neutralizing antibodies.
2.4 Non-Amgen Medicinal Product Background : Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) receptor, 
thus inhibiting its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and 
programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro data, 
pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1.  
Product:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195
Date:  15 June 2018 Page 28of 117
CONFIDENT IALPembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical 
development as an intravenous (IV) immuno therapy for advanced malignancies.  
Keytruda™ (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number 
of indications.  For more details on specific indications refer to the 
Pembrolizumab Investigator’s Brochure .
2.5 Rationale
To date, anti -PD-1 antibodies have been approved for a number of indications However, 
the majority of patients do not show a response to monotherapy. A potential mechanism 
of resistance to anti -PD-1 therapy is the immunosuppressive activity of tumor 
infiltrat ing/associa ted macrophages , which may impair the T cells’ ability to enter the 
tumor itself or hamper the intra -tumoral T cell activation. CSF -1R mediates proliferation, 
survival, and differentiation of tissue resident macrophages. Inhibition and depletion of 
TAMs t hrough CSF- 1R blockade may therefore relieve immunosuppressive pathways 
that restrict productive anti -tumor T cell res ponses and result in enhanced T cell 
responses against tumors. CSF -1R blockade as monotherapy was shown to reduce 
TAMs frequency in human tumors and pre -clinical murine tumor models, and had mild 
efficacy in syngeneic murine tumor models. CSF -1R blockade combined with chemo 
and/or T cell -targeted therapies, such as anti -PD-1, has led to increased T cell 
recruitment into tumors and enhanced e fficacy. AMG 820 is a fully human IgG2 
monoclonal antibody directed against human CSF -1R (c-fms) and represents a potential 
anti-tumor therapeutic approach by targeting macrophages in the tumor 
micro -environment. In a Phase 1 study, AMG 820 has shown a linear pharmacokinetic 
profile and promising pharmacodynamics effects (serum CSF -1 upregulation, depletion 
of macrophages in skin biopsies). AMG 820 dose options for Phase 2 were established 
without reaching a maximum -tolerated dose (MTD). Combination of a CSF-1R targeting 
antibody such as AMG 820, with an anti -PD-1 antibody like pembrolizumab may result in 
enhanced anti -tumor effect.
2.6 Clinical Hy potheses
AMG 820 in combination with pembrolizumab issafe and well tolerated when 
administered in subjects with select advanced solid tumors
AMG820 can enhance the anti -tumor activity observed with pembrolizumab alone 
and/or overcome lack of response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in subjects with 
select advanced solid tumors

3.1 Study  Design
This is a multi -center Phase 1b/2 study testing the combination of AMG 820 and
pembrolizumab in subjects with select advanced solid tumors. Part 1 wi ll evaluate safety 
of the selected starting dose for the combination. Part 2 will further evaluate safety and
testwhether AMG 820 in combination with pembrolizumab can enhance the anti -tumor 
activity observed historically with pembrolizumab alone and/or overcome lack of 
response to pembrolizumab monotherapy.   Study part 2 will follow a Simon two -stage 
design to evaluate 4 groups as per the figure below:

Eligible subjects enrolled in the study will receive AMG 820 1400 mg in combination with 
200mg pembrolizumab as an intravenous infusion Q3W .  AMG 820 will initially be 
tested at a dose of 1400 mg Q3 W based on the safety and tolerability demonstrated in 
the first -in-human study, which evaluated doses up to 20 mg/kg Q2 W.  In addition, 
maximal sustained serum concentrations of CSF -1 were observed at AMG 820 doses of 
10 mg/kg Q2 W and above.  Pem brolizumab will be ad ministered Q3 W at a dose of 
200mg based on t he dose currently being evaluated in pembrolizumab trials with 
registration inten t in head and neck cancer.

CONFIDENT IALIf the starting dose is not well tolerated, the lower pre-specified nominal AMG 820dose
levels to be explored are 1100 mg and 800mg Q3W .  The de-escalated doses of 
AMG820 at 1100 mg and 800 mg are anticipated to result in lower serum AMG 820 
concentrations, based on inter -subject PK variability observed in the first -in-human 
study, while maintaining maximal sustained serum concentrations of CSF -1 observed at 
AMG 820 doses of 10 mg/kg Q2 W and above.  The pembrolizumab dose level will 
remain at 200 mg Q3 W.  While on study, s ubjects will undergo radiological MRI or 
CTassessment ,and clinical measurement of their tumor lesions during week 
10±1 week, and at 10± 2week intervals thereafter . In accordance with the irRECIST 
criteria, i n absence of clinical deterioration the subjects may continue on AM G 820 and 
pembrolizumab until progressive disease is confirmed by a  subsequent scan and/or 
clinica l evaluation of tumor lesions 4 to 6 weeks after the first detection of tumor 
progression. Subjects will be treated with AMG 820 and pembrolizumab until confirmed 
disease progression per modified irRECIST (Appendix D), or intolerance of study 
treatment, or clinically significant deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation, 
whichever occurs first , or the subject withdrawal of consent .  Due t o the mechanism of 
action of immune- enhancing therapies, subjects may experience enhanced T cell 
expansion and infiltration into tumors, leading to an apparent enlargement of existing 
lesions or the appearance of new lesions prior to maximal clinical benef it being 
observed.  A modified response criteria is necessary to allow the potential delayed 
clinical response to immune -enhancing therapies to be captured more accurately.
The overall study design is also described by a detailed study schema at the end of the 
protocol synopsis section.
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1 .
3.1.1 Phase 1b Study  Design (Part 1)
Part 1 of the study has a single -arm 6+3 design aimed at assessing the safety of the 
selected starting dose of AMG 820 in combination with pe mbrolizumab.  It will be 
conducted in subjects with select advanced solid tumors (CRC, pancreatic cancer, 
NSCLC and potentially other tumor types as per eligibility criteria).   If the selected 
starting dose is determined not tolerable following review of safety data, additional lower 
dose levels will be evaluated.  Up to 3 cohorts will be evaluated for safety and will 
include at least 6 subjects per cohort, and up to 18 subjects in total. The initial cohort will 
treat subjects at the selected starting dose of 1400 mg AMG 820 plus 200mg 
pembrolizumab Q3 W.The period for evaluation of a DLT in cycle 1 is 21 days.  A

other than an adverse event related to study drug.
If 0 or 1 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) 
then the dose combination will be determined to be tolerable and Part 2 initiated.
If 2 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a DLT then 3 additional evaluable 
subjects will be enrolled. 
If 3or more of the evaluable subjects experience a DLT (eg,33% or higher with 
9evaluable subjects) then th e dose combination will be determined to be 
non-tolerable and a second Part 1 cohort will be enrolled to test a decreased dose of 
AMG820 in combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab. Further degree of dose 
modification and/or schedule of administration will b e decided based on analysis of 
emerging safety and PK data.
Prior to opening a subsequent cohort for enrollment, the Dose Level Review Team 
(DLRT) will evaluate data from subjects enrolled into prior cohorts (at least 21 days of 
safety follow -up) including events with a longer onset time or events following exposure 
to multiple doses.  If late onset events occur during a cohort, the DLRT may adaptively 
re-consider the doses evaluated within a cohort for subsequent dosing and/or possibly 
trigger a de -escalation or withholding of additional doses in subsequent cohorts.  
3.1.2 Phase 2 Study  Design
The primary objective of study Part 2 is to further evaluate safety and efficacy of the
combination dose in the 4 selected CRC, pancreatic cancer and NSCLC subject groups .
Other tumor types may be explored based on emerging data.  The dose or doses to be 
evaluated in Part 2 will be based on results from Part 1 .  Part 2 will begin after safety of 
the dose level(s) explored in Part 1 has been assessed and determined to be saf e.  
Part 2 will include 6- 9 subjects from Part 1 who have been treated with the 
recommended combination dose, and will enroll additional CRC, pancreatic cancer and 
NSCLC subjects following a Simon two -stage design: stage 1 will enroll up to 
67subjects ov erall, stage 2 may add another 118 subjects as per the rules described 
below . The recommendations to enroll stage 2 are based on ORR (see rules described 
below) ;nonetheless , the DLRT (see Section 6.2.1.2.1 ) will make decisions after 
reviewing all available safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.   
Analysis of data in Part 2 will be done separately for each group (Group 1, 2, 3, 4a, 4b).
Group 1 will enroll up to 43 advanced MMR -proficient CRC subjects who are naïve to 
anti-PD-1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R therapies. Eighteen ( 18)subjects will be enrolled

relapsed during monotherapy with anti -PD-1/PD -L1 agents  and are 
anti-CSF-1/CSF -1R naïve.  These subjects will be further distributed equally between 
two sub- groups ( 4a and 4b) depending on the PD-L1 expression in the tumor tissue: 
high (≥  50%) and low (<  50%) expression (up to 29 i n each sub- group).   For each 
sub-group, an initial set of 10 subjects will be enrolled during the first stage and 
treated with the AMG  820 plus  pembrolizumab combination.   If no subjects have an

Subjects enrolled may be replaced if they are not evaluable for DLT (eg,asubject did 
not receive study treatment, or ended the study treatment before completion of DLT 
evaluation period for a reason other than experiencing a DLT).
3.5 Estimated Study  Duration
3.5.1 Study  Duration for Subjects
The duration of screening for each su bject will be approximately 28 days.  The duration 
of treatment will vary for each subject.  Subjects enrolled in Part 1 and 2 of the study can 
be treated for up to 24 months if treatment is tolerable and clinical benefit is observed .  
All subjects will complete a safety follow -up visit approximately 135(+7) days after the 
last dose of study treatment. After the safety follow -up visit, depending on the duration of 
their treatment on the study, some subjects will enter the long -term follow -up. The goal 
of the long -term follow -up is to obtain disease progression and survival information for a 
period of 12 months after the first combination dose.   The actual duration of the study for 
an individual subject is dependent upon the time required to assess PFS and OS at 
12months .
For subjects who continue treatment past 12 months and up to 24 months (if tolerable 
and clinical benefit is observed), only Visit Date, IP Administration, and AE/SAE 
information will be collected in EDC.  Remaining follow -up to be performed per 
institutional standard of care.
3.5.2 End of Study
Primary Completion :  is anticipated to occur when all Study Part 1 and 2 subjects have 
been enrolled and treated for at least 12months , been f ollowed up for PFS and OS at 
12months or discontinued from the study.
End of Trial :  iswhen the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for 
evaluation in the study. This is anticipated to occur no sooner than when the last subjec t 
enrolled in the study has been followed for at least 12 months after the administration of 
the first combination dose of study treatment.

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, Amgen 
requires a copy of the site’s written IRB/IEC approval of the protocol, informed consent 
form, and all other subject information and/or recruitme nt material, if applicable (see 
Section 11.2).  All subjects must personally sign and date the IRB/IEC and Amgen 
approved informed consent form before commencement of study -specific 
activit ies/procedures.   
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date, in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form ( CRF).
Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study (defined when the 
subject signs the informed consent ) receives a unique subject identification number 
before any study -related activit ies/procedures are performed.  The subject identification 
number will be assigned manually .  This number will be used to identify the subject 
throug hout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that 
subject.  Subjects who do not meet all eligibility criteria may be rescreened at the 
discretion of the investigator.  If a subject is being rescreened, he or she may need t o 
reconsent to the study to ensure that the IRB/IEC approved main informed consent form 
is signed within 28 days of enrollment .  Subjects who are determined not eligible after 
rescreen must be screen -failed and the reason for the screen -failure provided.  Subjects 
may only be enrolled once into this study.
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, includ ing if a subject is 
rescreened.

6.1 Classification of Product(s) and/or Medical Device(s)
The Amgen Investigational Product used in this study is AMG 820 .  
The Non- Amgen Investigational product(s) used in this study ispembrolizumab . The 
Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM), a document external to this protocol, 
contains detailed information regarding the storage, preparation, destruction, and 
administration of AMG 820 and pembrolizumab .
6.2 Investigational Product
AMG 820 and pembrolizumab will be administered intravenously Q3 Won the same day 
in sequence. The recommended starting dose of AMG 820, 1400 mg, is guided by the 
AMG 820 First in Human study.  Pembrolizumab will be administered at 200 mg and will 
remain unchanged during the course of the study.  If the treatment combination is not 
well tolerated during Study Part 1, AMG 820 will be de -escalated to pre -specified 
nominal dose levels, 1100 mg and 800 mg. 
AMG 820 m ust be administered before pembrolizumab on the same treatment day. The 
pembrolizumab infusion is to begin 15 minutes following the end of the AMG 820 
infusion.
6.2.1 Amgen I nvestigational Product :AMG 820
AMG 820 will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc. and distributed using 
Amgen clinical study drug distr ibution procedures.  AMG 820 willbe presented as a 
sterile, clear, colorless to slightly yellow frozen liquid in 20 mL glass vials.  Each glass 
vial will contain 3.0 mL of AMG 820 with a concentration of 70 mg/mL .  
6.2.1.1 Dosage, A dministration, and Schedule : AMG 820
AMG 820 must be prepared and administered by a qualified healthcare professional. 
Subjects should be assessed clinically for adverse events/toxicity prior to each dose 
using the CTCAE version 4 (Appendix A).  Complete blood count with differential and
chemistry panels including liver enzyme laboratory tests (ALT and AST)and total 
bilirubin should be obtained according to the Schedule of Assessme nts(Table 5)and the 
results should be checked within 2 days prior to each treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL    Each cycle of AMG 820  will be  3 weeks.  The initial cohort will treat subjects with 
1400 mg AMG  820 plus  200 mg pem brolizumab Q3W .  All subsequent doses will be 
administered Q3W (± 3) days.  The treatment cycle interval may be increased due to 
toxicity  as described in Section 6.  AMG 820 must be administered before 
pembroli zumab on treatment days.  Lower AMG 820 dose levels may be explored based 
on emerging safety data during study part 1.   If a subject requires corticosteroid dosing 
of > 10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) as supportive care, AMG 820 and 
pembrolizumab  dosing must be withheld until the corticosteroid dose has decreased  
to ≤ 10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) . 
AMG  820 will be diluted with the appropriate amount of 0.9% NaCl for a total volume of 
100 mL.  The final concentration of the AMG  820 will be 14 mg/mL  (1400 mg total dose).  
AMG  820 preparations will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion,  through a 
0.22 µ m, low protein binding filter, over a 60- minu te period during the first dosing 
administration.  If the first administration is well- tolerated, the investigator may adopt a 
30-minute infusion period for subsequent infusions.  A physician or medical staff 
involved in study evaluation must be available during the administration of the investigational product to assess and treat adverse events that may arise during dosing.  Subjects will be monitored in the clinic for at least 2 hours or longer if necessary, following dosing of drug combination for the first 3 cycles  and as needed thereafter. 
The effects of overdose of this product are not known.  
Subjects will be treated  with AMG 820 plus pembrolizumab until su bjects experience 
confirmed PD  as per irRECIST , intolerance to study treatment, or until the end of study, 
whichever occurs first.  The dose, start date, and lot number of AMG 820 are to be 
recorded on each subject’s CRF. 
6.2.1.2  Dose- cohort Study E xploration and Stopping Rules 
6.2.1.2.1  Dose Level Review Meetings  
A Dose Level Review Team (DLRT) will review the safety data to evaluate DLT.  The 
DLRT will be composed of the Investigator(s), Amgen Medical Monitor  / Early 
Development Leader, Amgen Global Safety Officer or designee, Amgen Clinical 
Research Study Manager (CRSM) and Biostatistics representative or designee.  Additional members may be added as needed (eg, clinical pharmacologist).  A quorum,

CONFIDENT IALof the PI’s vote ),must be in attendance for DLRM. The DLRM will be rescheduled if a 
quorum is not reached.
The DLRM members will recommend dosing decisions, which may include enroll ing 
more subjects for DLT evaluation in part 1 of the study, de -escalation to a lower dose, 
delay or termination of dosing, or declare that the combination is tolerable based on DLT 
evaluation period data.  All DLRT decisions will be communicated to team m embers via 
formal correspondence.
The Dose Level Review Team (DLRT) will evaluate data from all subjects enrolled into 
all cohorts including events with a longer onset time or events following exposure to 
multiple doses.  If late onset events occur during a cohort, the DLRT may adaptively 
re-consider the doses evaluated within a cohort for subsequent dosing and/or possibly 
trigger a de -escalation or withholding of additional doses in subsequent cohorts.  For 
Part 2 of the study , DLRT safety review swill only be held during stage 1. A total of 
3DLRT safety review swill occur: after the first 20 subjects (collectively from all
5groups) have enrolled and completed 2 cycles of therapy , after an additional
20subjects have enrolled and completed 2 cycles of therapy and after all subject sin 
stage 1 have enrolled completed 2 cycles of therapy .
The DLRT may request additional reviews or recommend modifying or suspending the 
study if safety concerns arise during the study. Refer to Section 10.3.2 for additional 
details regarding the DLRT.
All DLRM requirements are outlined in the protocol. A DLRM Charter will not be used.
6.2.1.2.2 Rules for DLT Evaluation in Part 1 of the study
The DLT evaluation period for a subject is 21 days from the initial administration of study 
treatment.  To be evaluable for a DLT, subjects must have had the opportunity to be on 
treatment for at least 21 days from the initial dosing of study treatment and have 
received at least 1 dose of AMG 820 and 1 dose of pembrolizumab in combination, or 
have a DLT during the DLT evaluation period after at least 1 dose of AMG 820 and 
pembrolizumab.   Subjects may be replaced if they are not evaluable for DLT to obtain at 
least 6 DLT -evaluable subjects in a cohort during Study Part 1 (eg, a subject did not 
receive study treatment, or ended the study treatment before completion of DLT 
evaluation period for a reason other than experiencing a DLT).
Product:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195

CONFIDENT IALSafety will be evaluated considering the incidence of DLTs among all DLT -evaluable 
subjects enrolled in part 1, which will inc lude up to 3 cohorts. The initial cohort will treat 
subjects with 1400 mg AMG 820 plus 200mg pembrolizumab Q3 W using a 6+3 design.
If 0or 1 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a dose -limiting toxicity 
(DLT) then the dose combination will be determined to be tolerable and Study 
Part 2 will be initiated.
If 2 of the initial 6 evaluable subjects experience a DLT then 3 additional
evaluable subjects will be enrolled. 
If 33% or more of the evaluable subjects experience a DLT then the dose 
combination will be determined to be non -tolerable and a second Part 1 cohort 
will be enrolled to test a decreased dose of AMG 820 in combination with 200 mg 
pembrolizumab. Further degree of dose modification and/or schedule of 
administration will be decided based on analysis of emerging safety and PK data.
6.2.1.2.3 Dose -limiting Toxicity  Definition
An adverse event will be considered related to study treat ment (possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to the study treatment)  if there is a suspected “reasonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment (ICH E2A), and not only a lack of an alternative 
explanation for the toxicity. All toxicities will be g raded using the CTCAE version 4.0 
(Appendix A).
The occurrence of any of the following toxicities during DLT evaluation period (ie, 21 day
period from the initial administration of AMG 820 and pembrolizumab in combination) will 
be considered a DLT, if judged by the investigator to be related to the administration of 
AMG 820 and/or pembrolizumab:
Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity
Grade 3 or higher pneumonitis 
Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity lasting > 7days despite appropriate treatment
Grade 3 fatigue will not be classified as DLT, irrespective of duration
Any grade 3 or higher non -hematologic laboratory value if:
-medical interv ention is required, or
-the abnormality leads to hospitalization, or
-the abnormality persists at grade 3 or higher for > 1 week unless deemed not 
clinically important per both investigator and sponsor
Grade 3 or grade 4 febrile neutropenia
Product:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195
Date:  15 June 2018 Page 43of 117
CONFIDENT IALGrade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia with bleeding and Grade 4 or higher 
thrombocytopenia lasting > 48 hours or any thrombocytopenia requiring 
intervention
Delay in cycle 2 treatment for > 2 weeks due to study drug -related toxicity (unless 
clearly attributable to pembrolizuma bonly and delay is caused due to tapering of 
steroids)
Any other intolerable toxicity leading to permanent discontinuation of AMG 820 or 
pembrolizumab 
Lymphopenia of any grade is not considered a DLT 
Dose limiting toxicities do not include the following:
A transient (resolving to grade ≤  1 within 6 hours of onset) grade 3 
infusion- related adverse event
Any grade 3 endocrinopathy that is adequately controlled by hormonal 
replacement
Cumulative adverse events profile will be taken into consideration when making 
decisions on dose escalation or de -escalation. 
If an AE is clearly attributable to pembrolizumab (based on its known safety profile) and 
does not exceed the expected severity, this specific AE may be considered exempt from 
being a DLT.
Disease rela ted events should not be considered a DLT.
Any subject meeting the criteria for Hy’s Law case (ie, severe drug -induced liver injury) 
will be considered a DLT.  A Hy’s Law case is defined as: AST or ALT values of 
≥ 3 x ULN AND with serum total bilirubin level (TBL) of > 2 x ULN without signs of 
cholestasis and with no other clear alternative reaso n to explain the observed 
liver-related laboratory abnormalities (see Section 6.4on hepatotoxicity management 
andAppendix Afor further explanation of Hy’s law case and Management of Hepatic 
Function).
If a subject experiences a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, study treatment should
be discontinued for that subject.  Additionally, any treatment related toxicity meeting th e 
DLT definition after day 21 should result in discontinuation of therapy.  In subjects with 
irPR, irCR or evidence of clinical benefit (as determined by the investigator), an option to 
continue at the same or at a reduced dose level can be considered once the toxicity 
returns to the subject’s b aseline value or CTCAE grade ≤ 1 if deemed appropriate by the 
investigator and sponsor .

CONFIDENT IAL6.2.1.2.4 Determination of A dverse Event Severity  and Relatedness
Determination of the severity of adverse events will be consistent with CTCAE, 
version 4.0.  The relationship of an adverse event to investigational product will be 
determined by the investigator.  An adverse event will be considered related to study 
treatment (possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study treatment) if there is a 
suspected “reasonable causal relationship” to the study treatment (ICH E2A), and not 
only a lack of an alternative explanation for the toxicity (NCI Guidelines for 
Investigators -Adverse Event Reporting Requirements , Sept, 2013)
(see Section 9–Safety Data Collection, Recording, and Reporting).
6.2.1.2.5 Cohort Dose Level Determination
Study  Part 1
A Dose Level Review Team (DLRT) will convene beforea decision is made to open 
study Part 2.  At the start of Part 1, e nrollment of the first cohort of 6 to 9 evaluable 
patients will open for enrollment with a starting dose of AMG 820 1400 mg plus 
pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3 W.  Following subject completion of the DLT period, t he 
DLRT will review all available safety data for the first cohort .  If the data supports 
continued dosing at the selected starting dose , study Part 2 will be init iated at thesame 
dose level . If it is determined that the sta rting dose is non-tolerable ( if 33% or more of 
the evaluable subjects experience a DLT) , dose de -escalat ion will occur and a second 
Part 1 cohort will be enrolled to test a decreased dose of AMG 820 in combination with 
200mg pembrolizumab Q3W.  This will occur until identification of a well-tolerated dose 
for study Part 2 .The AMG 820 (mg) pre-specified nominal cohort dose levels to be 
explored are 1100 mg and 800mgQ3W.  The pembrolizumab dose level will remain at 
200mg Q3 W.

The dose or doses (proposed recommended phase 2 dose, RP2D) to be evaluated in 
part 2 of the study will be based on results from part 1 .  The DLRT may determine the 
RP2D, which is defined as a dose(s) that is/are safe and produces pharmacodynamic 
effects. Emerging safety data may be used to re -challenge the selected dose in Study 
Part 1 .  If the initially selected dose is re- challenged, a dditional subjects may be enrolled 
in the corresponding cohort.  In addition, the study may be discontinued or modified at 
any time due to documented safety findings.
Enrollment into the second stage of the Simon two -stage design will be determin ed by 
results through Study Part 2stage 1.
All dose level and enrollment decisions will be formally communicated to investigators

Permanent Discontinuation : AMG 820
A subject experiencing a DLT (days 1 -21) will not receive additional AMG 820plus
pembrolizumab treatment and will be followed until resolution of the event or toxicity. 
Subjects withdrawn from AMG 820 plus pembrolizumab therapy will be treated as 
deemed appropriate by the investigator. End of study procedures should be performed 
and the appropriate CRFs should be co mpleted. Any treatment related toxicity meeting 
the DLT definition after day 21 may result in discontinuation of therapy. In subjects with 
irPR, irCR or evidence of clinical benefit (as determined by the investigator), an option to 
conti nue at the same dose level or a lower dose level can be considered. If deemed 
appropriate by the investigator and sponsor, AMG 820can be re- initiated once the

CONFIDENT IALtoxicity returns to the subject’s baseline value or CTCAE grade ≤ 1. For subjects with 
hepatotoxicity, refer to Section 6.4. For such subjects, there will be an increased 
frequency of monitoring at an interval deemed appropriate by the investigator and 
sponsor.  Subjects requiring more than 6 weeks from the last dose to recover from 
AMG820 and/or pembrolizumab related grade 3 or 4 toxicities that meet the definition of 
a DLT will be permanently discontinued (please also see Table 2 for additional details) .
If a subject experiences ≥ grade 3 toxicities or SAEs that are unrelated to AMG820 
and/or pemb rolizumab , then treatment will be postponed until the toxicity has res olved to 
grade 1 (as defined by the CTCAE, version 4) or returns to the subject’s baseline value. 
If the treatment break is longer than 6 weeks from the last dose the subject may resume 
treatment only after discussing the case with the Sponsor. If resumi ng treatment, 
AMG820may be administered at the same dose level or a lower dose level as per the 
Principal Investigator and Sponsor.
In the event one of the combination drugs is delayed or permanently discontinued for 
related toxicity, the subjects will have the option to continue on the other drug as long as 
the toxicity is clearly not related to the combination partner and the investigator and 
Sponsor assessment is that the patient may derive benefit from continuation with 
monotherapy .
6.2.2 Non-Amgen Invest igational Product : Pembrolizumab
Non-Amgen investigational product pembrolizumab will also be used in this study. 
Pembrolizumab will be manufactured by Merck. Pembrolizumab will be labeled, 
packaged, and distributed by Amgen (or designee) using Amgen (or designee) clinical 
study drug distribution procedures. Pembrolizumab is supplied as pembrolizumab 
100mg/4mL vials (25 mg/mL) solution for intravenous infusion. 
Additional details regarding the pembrolizumab product are provided in the IPIM.
6.2.2.1 Dosage, A dmin istration, and Schedule : Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab must be prepared and administered by a qualified healthcare 
professional.  Subjects should be assessed clinically for adverse events/toxicity prior to 
each dose using the CTCAE version 4 (Appendix A).  Complete blood count with 
differential and chemistry panels including liver enzyme laboratory tests (ALT andAST)
and total bilirubin an d thyroid function tests (triiodothyronine [T3] or free T3 [FT3] per 
local standard , free thyroxine [FT4], and thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH]) should be 
obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5 ) and the results should be

CONFIDENT IALchecked within 2 days prior to each treatment.  Dosing will occur only if these test values 
are acceptable per Section 6.2.2.2 .
Pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg will be administered intravenously Q3W (±3days).  
AMG 820 and pembrolizumab should be administered on the same day, with AMG 820 
administered first. The pembrolizumab infusion is to begin 15 minutes following the end 
of the AMG 820 infusion.  Pembrolizumab dosing will continue as long as the re is 
derived clinical benefit, until confirmed PD per irRECIST, intolerance to treatme nt, 
24months from the date of t he first dose of pembrolizumab or end of study, whichever 
occurs first.  
Pembrolizumab infusion will be administered as a 30 -minute intr avenous infusion.  
Investigators should make every effort to target infus ion timing to be as close to 
30minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, 
a window of -5 and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 
30minutes: -5minutes/+10minutes). A central catheter is not required for infusion; 
however if a subject has a central venous catheter in place, it is recommended that it be 
used for the infusion.  A 0.2 or 0.22 µm in- line filter made of polyethersulfone must be 
used during administration to remove any adventitious particles.  If the infusion set does 
not contain a 0.2 or 0.22 µm in -line filter, it is recommended to use an extension line 
containing the filter.  Details on the dose calculation, prepar ation, and administration are 
provided in the IPIM.
The dose, start date, and lot number of pembrolizumab are to be recorded on each 
subject’s CRF.

study and should be followed until the swelling  resolves to grade 2.  Appropriate 
therapeutic intervention (eg topical 1% hydrocortisone with 0.25% phenylephrine and/or diuretics) to resolve the swelling may be administered at the discretion of the Investigator to any subject experiencing periorbital edema or conjunctival swelling of any 
grade.  
6.2.4  Rescue Medications and Supportive Care Guidelines for 
Pembrolizumab 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by 
the treat ing investigator including, but not limited, to the items outlined below. If a subject 
requires corticosteroid dosing of > 10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) as supportive 
care, AMG 820 and pembrolizumab  dosing must be withheld until the corticosteroid dose 
has decreased to ≤10 mg prednisone daily (or equivalent) as detailed in Section 6.2.2.2 . 
6.2.4.1  Pneumonitis and Interstitial Lung Disease  (ILD)  
Subjects with symptomatic pneumonitis, ILD, or acute interstitial pneumonitis (symptoms 
may include but are not limited to abnormal breath sounds, chest pain and/or tightness, 
dyspnea, dry cough, fatigue, fever, hemoptysis) should immediately stop receiving pembrolizumab and have an evaluation.  The evaluation may include bronchoscopy and pulmonary function tests to rule out other causes such as infection.  All attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease, bacterial or viral infection.  It is important that subjects with a suspected diagnosis of pneumonitis be managed as per the guidance in Table 3 . until treatment -related pneumonitis is excluded.  Treatment 
of both a potential infectious etiology and pneumonitis in parallel may be warranted.  Managem ent of the treatment of suspected pneumonitis with steroid treatment should 
not be delayed for a therapeutic trial of antibiotics.  If an alternative diagnosis is established, the subject  does not require management as in  Table 3 ; however , the 
adverse event should be reported regardless of etiology. 
If the subject is determined to have pembrolizumab associated pneumonitis, ILD, or 
acute interstitial pneumonitis, the suggested treatment is as follows (detailed plan i n 
Table 3 ). 
• For grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks.  
• For grade 3-4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids. Administer 
additional anti- inflammatory measures, as needed.  
• Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration.

CONFIDENT IALAmgen investigational product should be withheld pending investigation into alternative 
causes of DILI.  If investigational product (s)is withheld, the subject is to be followed 
according to recommendations in Appendix Afor possible DILI.  Rechallenge may be 
considered if an alternative cause for impaired liver tests (ALT, AST, ALP) and/or 
elevated total bilirubin, is discovered and the laboratory abnormalit ies resolve to normal 
or baseline ( Section 6.4.3 ).  
6.4.3 Criteria for Rechallenge of Amgen Investigational Product and Other 
Protocol -required Therapi esAfter Potential Hepatotoxicity
The decision to rechallenge the subject should be discussed and agreed upon 
unanimously by the subject, investigator , and Amgen.
If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, then Amgen investigational product and 
other pro tocol -required therapies, as appropriate should be permanently discontinued .  
Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation (as described in 
Section 6.4.1 )should never be rechallenged.
6.5 Concomitant Therapy
Throughout the study, investigator s may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those 
listed in Section 6.9.
Concomitant therapies are to be collected in the CRF from informed consent through
135(+7) days after the last dose of AMG 820 or pembrolizumab , whichever is later. In 
addition, any concomi tant medications associated with serious adverse events that 
occur through 135(+7) days after the cessation of all study treatment will be reported to 
Amgen and recorded in the CRF.
For concomitant therapies collect therapy name, indication, dose, unit, f requency, route, 
start date, and stop date.
6.6 Other Treatment Procedures
If a subject demonstrates evidence of new or worsening CNS metastases, all study 
treatments should be withheld and the investigator or designee should notify the 
sponsor’s medical monit or as soon as possible.  Subjects may be allowed to remain on 
study after discussion between the sponsor’s medical monitor and the investigator to 
determine the appropriateness of treatment resumption provided CNS lesions can be 
treated with stereotactic r adiotherapy, Gamma Knife, or craniotomy.  After approval is 
obtained from the sponsor’s medical monitor, subjects may be allowed to reinitiate

A signed and dated IRB/IEC -approved informed consent must be obtained before any
study -specific procedures are performed.
Procedures that are part of routine care are not considered study -specific procedures 
and may be used at screening to determine eligibility. All subjects will be screen ed for 
eligibility before enrol lment. Only eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study. During 
treatment, assessments and procedures can be performed within 3 days of the planned 
visit. It is recommended that dosing occur on the same day of the we ek (eg, if first dose 
is administered on Monday, all subsequent doses should be administered on a Monday), 
however a ± 3 -day dosing and study procedure window is allowed.
The following laboratory analytes in Table 6 will be assessed at various times throughout

7.4 Radiological Imaging Assessment 
Radiological imaging to assess the extent of disease will be assessed by standardized 
contrast-enhanced MRI / CT and evaluated according to Immune-related Response 
Criteria in Solid tumor irRECIST (ref,  Appendix D ).  A contrast-enhanced MRI should be 
the preferred imaging method for tumor staging.  A CT should be done when MRI is not 
possible, is relatively contraindicated (eg, allergy to contrast) or for the evaluation of 
body sites where MRI is not the recommended adequate staging method.  In order to 
reduce radiation exposure for subjects, low dose CT techniques should be applied 
whenever possible.  Organ-specific imaging protocols or existing diagnostic guidelines 
should be followed whenever possible to evaluate the full extent of the disease 
appropriately.   
Radiographic imaging of the chest, abdomen and pelvis are required at screening.  
Tumor assessments must also include all other sites of disease.  The screening scans 
must be performed within 28 days prior to enrollment and will be used as baseline.   For 
NSCLC subjects, MRI of the brain is required at screening.   During treatment, follow- up 
radiographic imaging of the abdomen, pelvis and chest, along with tumor assessments 
of all other sites of disease, will be performed independent of treatment cycle at week 10 
(±1 week), and then every 10 weeks (±2 weeks) or more frequently if clinically indicated 
until confirmed PD per irRECIST or start of new anticancer treatment.  Response 
(immune-related Complete Response [irCR], immune-related Partial Response [irPR]) 
and progression (immune-related Progressive Disease [irPD]) require confirmation by a 
repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 to 6 weeks from the date of the first 
documented assessment.  For confirming response, the repeat scan may be performed 
any time after 4 weeks from the first suspected radiologic evidence of response and may 
be delayed, at the discretion of the managing physician, until the next scheduled scan to 
avoid unnecessary procedures.  Upon discussion with the Sponsor, subjects may 
continue to receive treatment after radiographic confirmation of progressive disease as 
long as they continue to derive clinical benefit  and until further increase in tumor burden. 
For analyses purpose, date of PD is the date of initial observed PD. 
Radiographic assessment at the end of the study or during the EOT visit should be 
performed if the last imaging assessment was performed  6 weeks before the EOT and 
the subject has not had evidence of confirmed disease progression. 
All radiological imaging scans will be done as indicated in the Imaging Manual provided 
by the core laboratory.  All subsequent scans will be performed in the same manner as 
at screening, preferably on the same scanner (unless a subject develops hypersensitivity

CONFIDENTIA Lto MRI contrast du ring the study, in which case a switch to CT is acceptable after 
consultation with Amgen and the imaging core laboratory).
Determination of disease response for clinical management of subjects will be assessed 
at the clinical sites per irRECIST.  Scans wil l be submitted to the imaging core laboratory 
and may be used for response assessment including RECIST 1.1, irRECIST and 
exploratory analysis such as volumetric and viable tumor measurements.  Detailed 
information regarding the submission of images to the core laboratory is found in the 
Imaging Manual.
7.4.1 Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans
Brain MRI scans will be conducted at screening for all NSCLC subjects.  In subjects with 
known brain metastasis, brain MRI scans will be conducted at screening and at th e 
same schedule as MRI/CT scans. Brain MRI scans may also be performed at any time, 
if in the judgment of the investigator, the subject displays signs or symptoms of central 
nervous system (CNS) disease progression.
7.4.2 Tumor A ssessments
Tumor assessments wil l be performed at the sites based on modified irRECIST as 
outlined in Appendix D.
7.5 Antibody  Testing Procedures
Blood sample(s) for Antibody testing are to be collected as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments, Table 5 ,for the potential measurement of anti -AMG 820 and 
anti-pembrolizumab binding antibodies.  Samples testing positive for anti-AMG 820 or 
anti-pembrolizumab binding antibodies may also be tested for neutralizing antibodies 
and may be further characterized for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of 
immune complexes.  Additional blood samples may be obtained to rule out 
anti-AMG 820antibodies during the study.  
Refer to the Schedule o f Assessments ( Table 5 ), as applicable, for specific time points 
and the laboratory manual for detailed collection and handling instructions.

7.7 Pharmacogenetic Studies
If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic analysis of this study, DNA 
analyses may be performed.  These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on 
inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible cor relation to the disease and/or 
responsiveness to the therapies used in this study .  No additional samples are collected 
for this part of the study.   For subjects who consent to this/these analysis/analyses, DNA 
may be extracted from the available blood samples collected during the study .
7.8 Sample Storage and Destruction
Any blood or tissue sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 5) can be analyzed for any of the tests out lined in the protocol and for any tests 
necessary to minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical 
methods produce reliable and valid data throughout th e course of the study .  This can 
also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability. 
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being ship ped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure datab ase to ensure 
confidentiality.  
If informed consent is provided by the subjec t,Amgen cando additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to invest igate and better understand the 
disease, dose response and/or prediction of response to the combination of AMG 820 
andpembrolizumab , characterize antibody response , and other drug aspects 
(eg,mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from th eseanalys es are to be 
documented and maintained, but willnot be necessarily reported as part of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to 20 years.

CONFIDENTIA LSince the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the 
treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic , biomarker development, o r other 
exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be 
made availab le to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other 
third parties, except as specified in the informed consent.
The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by 
contacting the investigator.  Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to 
provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining 
blood or tumor tissue samples and any other components from the cells can be located 
and destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for 
destruction, will be retained by Amgen.
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or derivative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as 
appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this 
research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no 
commercial rights to such product and has no commercial rights to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.

9. SAFETY DA TA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING
9.1 Definition of Safety  Events
9.1.1 Disease Related Events
Disease Related Events are events (serious or non- serious) anticipated to occur in the 
study population due to the underlying disease.  These could include overall disease 
progression or pain or discomfort caused by growing tumors. Such events do not meet 
the definition of an Adverse Event unless assessed to be more severe than expected for 
the subject’s condition. 
Disease Related Events and/or Disease Related Outcomes that do not qualify as 
Serious Adverse Events: 
An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease 
progression in oncology or hospitalization due to disease progression) is to be 
reported as a Disease Related Event. 
Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event CRF.
If the outcome of the underlying disease is worse than that which would normally be 
expected for the subject, or if the investigator belie ves there is a causal relationship 
between the investigational product(s)/study treatment protocol required therapies and 
disease worsening, this must be reported as a n Adverse Event or Serious Adverse 
Event.
9.1.2 Adverse Events
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by t he subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record.  
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg,diabetes, migraine h eadaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly 
Product:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195
Date:  15 June 2018 Page 78of 117
CONFIDENTIA Lworse outcome than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more t han usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study ,
is not considered an adverse event.   
For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to the primary 
tumor type being studied ,report all known signs and symptoms.   Death due to disease 
progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary 
tumor type (eg, metastatic pancreatic cancer).
Note:   The term “disease progression” should not be used to describe the disease 
related event or adverse event.
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapies 
or the study due to an adverse event, refer to Section 8.1for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study.   
9.1.3 Serious A dverse Events
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event as 
defined in Section 9.1.1 ):
fatal
life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)
requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
congenital anomaly/birth defect
other medically important serious event
A dis ease related event (eg,disease progression or pain or discomfort cau sed by 
growing t umors) is to be reported as a serious adverse event if 
the subject’s pre -existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would 
consider typical for a patient with the same underlying condition, or
if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational 
medicinal product(s)/protocol -required therapies and the event, 
and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria above.
Product:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195
Date:  15 June 2018 Page 79of 117
CONFIDENTIA LAn adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an i nvestigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix Afor 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency 
room visit , outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.
9.2 Safety  Event Reporting Procedures 
9.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Disease Related Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all Disease Related Events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after the first dose of AMG 820 or 
pembrolizumab through the safety follow -up visit (ie, 135 [+7] days after the last dose of 
AMG 820 or pembrolizumab, whichever is later )are reported using the Event CRF.  
Additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal Disease Related E vent on the 
Event CRF.  
Disease -Related Events assessed by the Investigator to be more severe than expected 
and/or related to the investigational medicinal product(s)/study 
treatment/protocol -required therapies, and determined to be serious, must be recor ded 
on the Event CRF as Serious Adverse Events.
9.2.2 Adverse Events
9.2.2.1 Reporting Procedures for A dverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the su bject that occur after first dose of AMG 820 or 
pembrolizumab through the safety follow -up visit (ie, 135[+7] days after the last dose of 
AMG 820 or pembrolizumab, whichever is later )are reported using the Event CRF.
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:
Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),
Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved or improved to a lower grade ),
Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],
Assessment of relatedness to AMG 820 and/or pembrolizumab and
Action taken.

CONFIDENTIA LThe adverse event grading scale used will be the CTCAE version 4.0 .  The grading 
scale used in this study is described in Appendix A.  The investigator must assess
whether the adverse event is possibly related to the AMG 820 and/or pembrolizumab .  
This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is th ere a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational 
product(s) ?  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol -required 
procedure (including any screening procedure(s)).  This relationship is indicated by a 
“yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by a study ac tivity (eg, administration of investigational product,  
protocol -required procedure”? 
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the 
investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require t reatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  W here applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to th e date of 
resolution, record a single event for each level of severity on the Event CRF.
The Investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility. 
9.2.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious A dverse Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the consent  
through 135(+7) days after the cessation of all study treatment are recorded in the 
subject’s medi cal record and are submitted to Amgen .  Additionally, treatment related 
serious adverse events that occur after the safety follow -up visit through the end of the 
long-term follow -up will be reported.
All serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF.

Protocol Number:  20150195
Date:  15 June 2018 Page 81of 117
CONFIDENTIA LIf the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic 
Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.  See Appendix Bfor a sample of the Serious Adverse Event 
Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  For EDC 
studies where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via 
the electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be 
entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure.   This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study activity/procedure”? 
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events un til stabilization 
or resolution . 
All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to Amgen within 24 hours 
following knowledge of the new information.   The investigator may be asked to provide 
additional follow -up information, which may include a discharge summary or extracts 
from the medical record.  Information provided about the serious adverse event must be 
consistent with that recorded on the Event CRF.
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapies because of a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen.
Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance wi th all reporting requirements according to local regulations and GCP.
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in accordance with 
local procedures and statutes.
9.2.2.3 Reporting Serious A dverse Events A fter the Protocol- required 
Reporting Period
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for new serious adverse events 
following the protocol -required reporting period after the end of study.   However, these 
serious adverse events can be reported to Amgen.  In some countries (eg, European 
Union [EU] member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events

CONFIDENTIA Lthat they become aware of after the protocol -required reporting period after the end of 
study.  If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to 
Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event.
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period willbe
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited 
reporting.
9.3 Pregnancy  and Lactation Reporting
If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or female partner of a male subject, while the 
subject is taking protocol -required therapies report the pregnancy to Amgen as specified 
below.
In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
monitor for pregnancies that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapies 
through 7 months after the last dose of AMG 820 or 4 months after the last dose of 
pembrolizumab.
Thepregnancy should be reported to Amgen’s Global Safetywithin 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on the 
Pregnancy Notification W orksheet ( Appendix C).  Amgen’s Global Safetywill seek to 
follow with the Investigator regarding additional information that may be requested. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the Investig ator should attempt 
to obtain information regarding the birth outcome and health of the infant.    
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
Serious Adverse Event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abor tion, 
stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly) the 
Investigator will report the event as a Serious Adverse Event.
If a female breastfeeds while taking protocol -required therapies report the lactation case 
to Amgen a s specified below. 
Any lactation case should be reported to Amgen’s Global Safety within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of event.  Report a lactation case on the Lactation Notification 
Worksheet ( Appendix C).  Amgen Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the 
Investigator regarding additional information that may be requested.

9.4 Pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest
Selected adverse events known as Pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest must be 
reported to Amgen within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event 
regardless of attribution to pembrolizumab.
For the time period beginning at time of first dose o f pembrolizumab through 
135(+7)days following cessation of pembrolizumab treatment, or 135(+7) days after 
initiation of a new anti -cancer therapy, any Pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest , or 
follow -upto a Pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest , whether or not related to the 
pembrolizumab, must be reported within 24 hours to Amgen.
Pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest for this trial include:
an overdose of pembrolizumab, as defined in Section 9.5
potential drug- induced liver injury (DILI) from pembrolizumab as defined in 
Section 9.6
Subjects should be assessed for possible Pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest 
prior to each dose.
9.5 Definition of an Overdose of Pembrolizumab for This Protocol and 
Reporting of Pembrolizumab Overdose
For the purpose of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose 
of pembrolizumab equal to or greater than 300mg.  No specific information is available 
on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab.  In the event of overdose, 
pembrolizumab should be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for 
signs of toxicity.  Appropriate treatment shoul d be provided if clinically indicated.
If an adverse event(s) or serious adverse event(s) is associated with (“result from”) the 
overdose of pembrolizumab , the adverse event(s) or serious adverse event is to be 
reported to Amgen as described in Section 9.2.2 .  In addition, the adverse event(s) or 
serious adverse event(s) associated with (“result from”) the overdose of pembrolizumab

24hours of discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic 
investigations have been concluded)
The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed.
Workup to confirm DILI should be immediately initiated as described in the 
pembrolizumab Event of Clinical Interest Guidance for Potential DILI in Clinical Trials 
document.  Any confirmed event of DILI is tobe reported as a serious adverse event 
within 24 hours after confirmation of the event.  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a s erious adverse event defined in Section 9.1.3 .

10.1.2 Analysis Sets
The analysis of all endpoints, unless noted otherwise, will be conducted on the Safety 
Analysis Set defined as all subjects that are enrolled and receive at least 1 dose of 
AMG820. The analysis of DLT will be r estricted to DLT -evaluable subjects 
(seeSection 6.2.1.2.2 ). The PK Analysis Set will contain all subjects who have received 
at least 1 dose of the investigational product and have at least 1 PK sample collected. 
These subjects will be evaluated for PK analysis unless the number of data points 
required for analysis is not enough, or significant protocol deviations have affected the 
data, or if key dosing or sampling information is missing .  
10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups
The relationship of covariates to efficacy endpoints will be explored if appropriate.
Biomarker data (eg,PD-L1 expression) may be incorporated in additional explo ratory 
subgroup or multivariate analyses. The exploratory analyses of biomarkers may be 
performed after collection of all samples during the conduct of the study and therefore 
may be reported af ter the primary analysis of the safety and efficacy endpoints.   
10.2 Sample Size Considerations
It is anticipated that 67to 197subjects will be enrolled overall in this study. 
Part 1 will enroll 6 to 18 evaluable subjects. The sample size in Part 1 is based on 
practical consideration, and it is consistent with conventional oncology studies with the 
objective to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a treatment combination.  With 
6subjects in a cohort, there is a 47 -91% probability of observing at least one DLT if the 
true DLT rate is 10 -33%.

Protocol Number:  20150195

CONFIDENTIA LPart 2 evaluation of efficacy will include at least 6 subjects from part 1 who have been 
treated with the recommended combination dose, and will enroll additional CRC , 
pancreatic cancer and NSCLC subjects up to maximu m 185subjects overall. The 
sample size in each group evaluated in Part 2 is chosen to test whether AM820 can 
enhance the anti -tumor activity observed historically with pembrolizumab alone and/or 
overcome lack of response to pembrolizumab monotherapy. For each group and 
sub-group enrollment may stop early due to insufficient clinical activity. The pre -planned 
recommendation for early termination is based on ORR (evaluated when the subjects 
complete at least 6 months of treatment or earlier if already r eaching the recommended 
number of responders), nonetheless the DLRT (see Section 6.2.1.2.1) will make the 
decision for early termination after rev iewing all available safety, efficacy, 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.
Group 1 will consist of up to 43 subjects with MMR –proficient CRC (only 18 enrolled 
initially in the first stage) who are naïve to anti -PD-1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R treatment. In 
2015, Le et al reported a pembrolizumab objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST1.1 
and irRC of 0% (0 of 18 patients) for MMR –proficient colorectal cancers. It is anticipated 
that the combination treatment of AMG 820 and pembrolizumab will have an ORR of 
25% or higher in MMR –proficient CRC tumors; an ORR of 10% or less is considered to 
be insufficient anti -tumor activity to warrant future research. If 2 or fewer of the initial 
18 subjects have an objective response then the recommendation is for enrollment to 
Group 1 be stopped for futility. If 8 or more of the 43 subjects have an objective 
response then the true ORR is determined to be >10%.  This Simon Two -Stage design 
provides 80% power when the true ORR is 25% while m aintaining a 1 -sided , 
5%alpha error when the true ORR is 10% or lower. 
Group 2 will consist of up to 29 subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer (only 
10enrolled initially in the first stage) who have not rec eived prior treatment with a 
PD-1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R inhibitor . In 2012, Brahmer et al reported a pembrolizumab
ORR of 0% (0 of 14 patient s) for pancreatic cancer . It is anticipated that the combination 
treatment of AMG 820and pemb rolizumab will have an ORR of 20% or higher in 
pancreatic tumors; a n ORR of 5 % or less is considered to be insufficient anti -tumor 
activity to warran t future research. If none of the initial 10 subjects have an objective 
response then the recommendation is for enrollment to Group 2be stopped for futility. If 
4 or more of the 29 subjects have an objective response then the true ORR is 
determined to be >5 %.  This Simon Two -Stage design provides 8 0% power when the

Group 3will consist of up to 55 subjects (only 19 enrolled initially in the first stage) with 
NSCLC who have not received prior treatment with a PD -1/PD -L1/CSF -1/CSF -1R 
inhibitor, and who have tumor PD -L1 expression <50%. Garon et al in 2015 reported a 
pembrolizumab ORR per RECIST1.1 of 13.1% (28 of 214 patients) for NSCLC patients 
with tumor PD -L1 expression <50%, and an ORR of 14.4% (21 or 146 patients) for those 
with tumor PD -L1 expression from 1% to 49%. It is anticipated that the combination 
treatment of AMG 820and pembrolizumab will have an ORR of 30% or higher in low 
PD-L1 expressing subjects; an ORR of 15% or less is con sidered to be insufficient 
anti-tumor activity to warrant future research. If 3 or fewer of the initial 19 subjects have 
an objec tive response then enrollment to Group 3will be stopped for futility. If 13 or 
more of the 55 subjects have an objective response then the true ORR is determined to 
be >15%. This Simon Two- Stage design provides 80% power when the true ORR is 
30% while m aintaining a 1 -sided , 5% alpha error when the true ORR is 15% or lower. 
Group 4will consist of up to 58 NSCLC who received prior treatment with a PD -1/PD -L1 
inhibitor, and failed to respond to or relapsed during therapy. These subjects must be 
also naive to anti -CSF-1/CSF -1R agents.  There will be two sub -groups. Sub- group 4a 
will enroll up to 29 (only 10 enrolled initially in the first stage)  subjects who have tumor 
PD-L1 expression <50% (see Garon et al., 2015 ) while sub -group 4 b will enroll up to
29subjects who have tumor PD -L1 expression ≥50% (only 10 enrolled initially in the first 
stage) . It is anticipated that the combination treatment of AMG 820and pembrolizumab 
will have an ORR of 20% or higher in these NSCLC subjects; an ORR of 5% or les s is 
considered to be insufficient anti -tumor activity to warrant future research. If none of the 
initial 10 subjects in a sub- group have an objective response then the recommendation 
is for enrollment to the sub -group be stopped for futility. If 4 or mo re of the 29 subjects 
in the sub -group have an objective response then the true ORR is determined to be 
>5%. This Simon Two- Stage design provides 80% power when the true ORR is 20% 
while maintaining a 1- sided,5% alpha error when the true ORR is 5% or lowe r.

CONFIDENTIA Lstage 1 , similar assessments will be held aftereach set of 20 subjects have enrolled
through the end of Part 2 stage 1 enrollment . 
In Part 2, a Simon Two -Stage design is used for all groups (Group 1 -3, 4a, 4b) with the 
first stage enrolling n=18, 10 19, 10 and 10 subjects, respectively (see design schema ). 
Each group will enroll subjects to a first stage.   The second stage for each group will be 
enrolled depending on clini cal activity from stage 1, evaluated when the subjects have 
been treated for at least 6 months or earlier if the required number of responders have 
been reached (see Section 10.2 for details). The pre- planned recommendations for 
enrollment to stage 2 are based on ORR per local irRECIST, howe ver the DLRT will 
make the decisions for stage 2 enrollment after reviewing all available safety, efficacy, 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.
10.3.2 Dose Level Review Team (DLRT)
Dose Level Review Meetings ( DLRMs )will be held to review data, monitor safety, and 
make decisions on dose escalation / change decisions . The DLRT will be composed of 
the investigator s or designees, and the following Amgen representatives: medical 
monitor, early development leader, global safety officer or designee, clinical study 
manager, biostatistician andclinical pharmacologist.  A dditional members may be added 
as needed. The fol lowing members are responsible for DLRT decisions: investigators, 
Amgen medical monitor, and global safety officer or designee. Study decisions by
DLRM participants must be unanimous.  All available study data, including data collected 
after the initial DLTwindow, and including demographics, IP administration, medical 
history, concomitant medications, adverse events, ECGs, vital signs, laboratory data, 
efficacy and PK/PD information will be reviewed. In addition to DLTs, all ≥ grade 3 
toxicities not meet ingDLT criteria will be reviewed and may be considered in DLRT 
decisions.   The study may be discontinued or modified at any time due to documented 
safety findings.
All DLRM requirements are outlined in the protocol.  A DLRM Charter will not be used.

CONFIDENTIA LThe Amgen Clinical Monitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research.  The Clinic al Mo nitor is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries on the CRFs.
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the clinical monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in 
completing CRFs, are resolved.
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global Compliance Auditing function (or 
designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol -required therapy storage 
areas, laboratories) and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate the study 
conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements.
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:
All source documentation supporting entries into the CRFs must be maintained and 
readily available.
Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail”.
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen.  During this 
review, subjec t data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data arereviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution 
and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an Amgen reviewer.
The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this electronic data 
capture stud y or the investigator applies an electronic signature in the EDC system if 
the study is set up to accept an electronic signature .  This signature indicate sthat 
investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the CRF, the data queries, and 
agrees with the content.
Amgen (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections (SECs) to obvious data errors 
in the clinical trial database. SECs will be documented in the Standard Self Evident 
Corrections document and the eCRF Specific Instructions, both of these will be available

Drug -induced Liver Injury  Reporting & A dditional A ssessments 
Reporting
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST orALT 
and TBL and/or INRelevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.4require 
the following:
The event is to be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)
The appropriate CRF (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary 
to facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is tobe 
completed and sent to the Amgen. 
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Secti on 9.1.3 .
Additional Clinical A ssessments and Observation
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies is/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in 
Sections 6.4.1 and6.4.2 or who experience AST or ALT elevations ≥ 3 x ULN are to
undergo a period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the 
subject’s baseline levels.  Assessments that are tobe performed during this period 
include: 
Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours 
In cases of TBL ≥ 2x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve
Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapies has/have been 
discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic .

CONFIDENTIA LAppendix D.  Modified Immune -Related Response Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(irRECIST )
The Immune -related Response Criteria (irRC) based on bidimensional measurements 
were derived from WHO/RECIST to serve as guidelines to systematically characterize 
additional patterns of response in patients with advanced melanoma receiving 
ipilimumab therapy and to allow the potential delayed clinical response to 
immune -enhancing therapies to be captur ed more accurately (Wolchok JD et al., 2009 ).  
Recent evaluation showed that irRC using unidimensional measurements provided 
highly concordant tumor response assessment and less measurement variability 
compared with bidimensional measurements ( Nishino M et al., 2013). This study will 
utilize amodified criteria (irRECIST), adapting the immune -related response criteria to 
conventional RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al, 2009) as outlined below.
Antitumor response based on total measurable tumor burden
For irR ECIST , only index and measurable new lesions are taken into account (in 
contrast to conventional RECIST 1.1 , which do esnot require the measurement of 
new lesions, nor do they include new lesion measurements in the characterizati on of 
evolving tumor burden).
Tumor burden assessment :
All measurable and non -measurable lesions should be assessed at screening and at 
the defined tumor assessment time points.
oAt baseline tumor assessment: tumor burden is the sum of the longest 
diameters (S LD) of all index lesions ( 5lesions per organ , up to 10total 
lesions) . 
oAt each subsequent tumor assessment: tumor burden is the S LD of the index 
lesions and of new, measurable lesions ( >10mmin the longest diameter ; up 
to 5new lesions per organ and up to 10 total lesions) added together
Tumor burden = S LDindex lesions + SLDnew, measurable lesions
Time point response assessment using modified irR ECIST
Percentage changes in tumor burden per assessment time point describe the size and 
growth kinetics of both conventional and new lesions as they appear.  At each tumor 
assessment, the response in index and new measurable lesions is defined based on the 
change in tumor burden (after ruling out irPD).  Decreases in tumor burden must be 
assessed relative to baseline measurements (ie, th e SLD of all index lesions at 
screening).

Protocol Number:  20150195

CONFIDENTIA LDefinitions: 
Methods of measurement:
oThe same imaging modality, method of assessment, and technique must be 
used throughout the study to characterize each id entified and reported lesion.
oMRI or CT scans should b e performed with contiguous slice thickness of 
5mm or less according to the Imaging Manual . Subjects should be evaluated 
at screening for tolerance to MRI/CT IV contrast.  Subjects intolerant of CT IV 
contrast ie ,allergy or renal insufficiency should be imaged using non -contrast 
CT for the chest and MRI (with or without contrast) for the abdomen and 
pelvis to enable the best detection of disease throughout the study starting at 
baseline.  If a subject develops a m edical contradiction to the MRI/CT IV 
contrast while on study, preapproval of the sponsor is needed to switch from 
contrast enhanced MRI to non- contrast MRI or to CT(and vice versa).
oIf a combined PET/CT scan is performed at the discretion of the investig ator
at baseline and subsequent timepoints , the CT portion of that exam should 
not be substituted for the dedicated diagnostic CT exams required by this 
protocol unless the investigator or the site radiologist can document that the 
CT performed as part of a PET/CT is of identical diagnostic quality to the
diagnostic CT as described in the Imaging Manual, then the CT portion of the 
PET/CT can be used for tumor measurements.
oPathological lymph nodes (short axis >10 mm ) should be assessed by 
MRI/CT.  Only node s with short axis >15 mm are to be included as 
measurable lesions.
oPatients with suspected brain metastases will also undergo MRI of the brain.
oAll baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment ,and not more than 28 days before the beginning of 
the treatment (cycle 1 day 1) .
Measurable disease: Subject must have radiographically measurable disease per 
RECIST 1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ).  
oMeasurable le sions:
Lesions with clear borders that can be measured accurately in 
onedimension (longest diameter > 10 mm as measured by MRI/CT 
with scan slice thickness <5 mm).
Pathologic lymph nodes aremeasurable when the longest diameter 
perpendicular to the long axis (s hort axis) is>15 mm on MRI/CT . 
Must exclude cystic lesions, pleural/pericardial effusions and ascites.
oNon-Measurable lesions: 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm but < 15 mm sh ort axis) and 
other truly non -measurable lesions are considered non -measurable 
and characterized as non- index lesions. 
Product:  A MG 820
Protocol Number:  20150195
Date:  15 June 2018 Page 112of 117
CONFIDENTIA LOnly cancerous lesions should be selected as non -measurable 
lesions and not indeterminate lesions and lesions that could be 
cancer. Oth er examples of non -measurable lesions include some 
bone lesions*, leptomeningeal disease, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of the skin or (lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis), 
and groups of lesions that are small and numerous.
Fluid collections
oAscites, pleural effusion, or pericardial effusion, should not be 
selected as non- measurable disease at baseline or, if new or 
increased, as evidence of progressive disease. These 
collections may occur with both benign and malignant 
conditions, and thei r etiology is often not clear. These 
collections may often be removed via interventional 
procedures, which can lead to a false interpretation of disease 
response. Thus, these fluid collections should not be used as 
a baseline non- index or as evidence of di sease response.
Bone Lesions
oBone scans, PET scans or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques to measures bone lesions. 
However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or absence of bone lesions.
oOsteolytic (lytic) bone les ions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, 
with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated 
by cross -sectional imaging technique such as CT or MRI can 
be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue 
component meets the definition of measura bility described 
above. Only the soft tissue component of the bone lesion 
should be measured.
oMany osteoblastic (blastic) bone abnormalities can be benign 
and should not be selected as baseline lesions. An isolated 
new small blastic lesion should not be selected as a new 
lesion unless there is demonstrated growth on subsequent 
scans. Multiple new blastic lesions that are clearly cancerous 
may be considered for new lesions.
Cystic lesions:
oLesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable or non- measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.
oCystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition 
of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic 
lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred 
for selection as index lesions. If a cystic lesion is clearly 
cancerous and has both cystic and solid components, then the 
complete les ion should be measured including both 
components without excluding the cystic portion of a cystic 
tumor lesion when measuring.

CONFIDENTIA LLesions with prior local treatment:
oTumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or an 
area subject to other loco -regional therapy, should not be 
considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion.
oIndex lesions: all measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5lesions per organ 
and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, are tobe 
identified as Index lesions, recorded and measured.  Index lesions are to be 
selected on the basis of their size and their suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements by imaging, and most representative of the subject’s tumor 
burden and overall d isease status .
oNew lesions: New measureable lesions (ie ,accurately and serially 
measure able in at least 1 dimension >10 mm for non -nodal lesions or the 
short axis is ≥15mm for nodal lesions).  The new measurable lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size and suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements by CT or MRI.  If there are more than 10 measureable new 
lesions detected at an imaging time point for a subject , lesions not selected 
for measurements would be considered non -Index lesions.
oNon-Index lesions: measurable lesions, other than index lesions, and all sites 
of non-measurable disease, will be identified as non -index lesions.  
Non-index lesions will be evaluated at the same assessment time points as 
the index lesions.  In subsequent assessments, changes in non- index lesions 
will contribute only in the assessment of complete response.
Pathologic lymph nodes with short axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm at 
baseline should be considered as non -index lesions 
oUnable to evaluate (UE):  Any lesion present at baseline which was not 
assessed or was unable to be evaluated leading to an inability to determine 
the status of that particular tumor for that time point
oNot Available (NA): Scan not available
oNot Done (ND):  Radiographic imag ingwere not perfo rmed at this time point 
to evaluate the index lesions
oMerging lesions:
When two or more index lesions merge, the smaller lesion should 
have 0 mm recorded for the current and all future assessments, and 
the larger lesion should have the longest diameter of the merged 
lesion recorded for the current assessment and be followed for future 
assessments.   
oSeparating lesions:
When anindex lesion splits into 2 or more lesions, the largest 
measurable part of the split lesion should be considered to be the 
previously recorded index lesion with measurements provided for the 
current assessment and followed fo r future assessments.  The 
remaining lesions would be non -index lesions. Any new lesions that 
result from separating should be documented as non -index lesions 
that were generated by separating and not truly new lesions.

CONFIDENTIA LIndex lesion response
oImmune -related Complete Response (irCR) –complete disappearance of all 
index lesions in two consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart
Pathologic lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm 
oImmune -related Partial Response (irPR) –decrease of 30% or greater in 
tumor burden compared with baseline in two consecutive observations at 
least 4 weeks apart 
oImmune -related Stable Disease (irSD) -  not meeting the criteria for irCR or 
irPR, in the absence of immune -related progressive disease
oImmune -related Pr ogressive Disease (irPD) –at least a 2 0% increase in 
tumor burden compared with nadir (at any single time point) in two 
consecutive observations at least 4 weeks apart
oWhen the size of the tumor lesion is considered ‘too small to measure’ 
(eg,less than 5 mm), a default value of 5 mm should be assigned for index 
lesions.  If this is nadir, irPD will be judged from the tumor burden calculated 
using the default value.  
Non-Index Lesion Response
oirCR –complete disappearance of all non -index lesions.  
Patho logic lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm 
oirPR and irSD –non-Index lesions are not considered in the definition of irPR
or irSD.  Measurements of non -index lesions are not required, but they are 
evaluated at each timepoint as ‘present’, ‘absent’ or ‘unequivocal 
progression’.  If a significant partial response is observed in a non -index 
lesion, it should be described as a comment.
oirPD –increases in number or size of non- index lesion(s) does not constitute 
progressive disease.  New l esions that are measurable up to 5 new lesions 
per organ and 10 total ) are included in the calculation of tumor burden in 
response assessments
Overall response
oirCR –complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not, 
and no new lesions) 
Confirmation by a repeat, consec utive assessment no less than 
4weeks from the date of the first documented response
oirPR –decrease in tumor burden > 30% relative to baseline. 
Confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than
4weeks after the first documentation
oirSD –not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of irPD
oirPD –increase in tumor burden ≥ 20% relative to nadir (minimum recorded 
tumor burden) and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir .   
Confirmation by a repeat, consec utive assessment no less than 
4weeks from the date of the first documented assessment.

CONFIDENTIA LResponse confirmation:
irCR and irPR:
othe repeat confirmation scan may be performed any time after 4 weeks from 
the first suspected radiologic evidence of response and may be delayed until 
the next scheduled scan to avoid necessary procedures
irPD:
oIn subjects who have initial evidence of radiological PD by irRECIST (irPD on 
one scan) , it is at the discretion of the PI whether to continue a subject on 
study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained based on their assessment of 
clinical stability.  Subjects may receive study treatment and tumor 
assessment should be repeated ≥ 4 weeks later in order to confirm irPD per 
site assessment.  
oIn determining whet her or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased 
per irRECIST, the local site investigator should consider all index as well as 
any incremental new measureable lesion(s).
oirPD is confirmed at repeat imaging (irPD on t wo consecutive scans at least 
4 weeks apart) if tumor burden remains ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute 
increase compared to nadir
oSubjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation 
of treatment without radiographic confirmation of disease progression
(confirme d irPD) at the time should have the reason for treatment 
discontinuation classified as ‘ clinical disease progression’.  In this case, irPD 
cannot be assigned at the time as the overall objective tumor response.  
Every effort should be made to radiographi cally confirm irPD even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

Section: 2.4 Non -Amgen Medicinal Product Background: Pembrolizumab :
Replace entire section: In the United States, pembrolizumab is approved for patients 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab 
and a BRAF inhibitor (if BRAF V600 mutation positive) and patients with metastatic 
NSCLC whose tumors express PD -L1 as determined by an FDA -approved test and who 
have disease progression on or after platinum -containing chemotherapy or 
FDA-approved therapy for EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations 
(Keytr uda®USPI, 2014).
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4 kappa immunoglobulin with
an approximate molecular weight of 149 kDa) that blocks the interaction between PD -1
and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2 (Keytruda®USPI, 2014). Consequently, the PD -1
pathway -mediated inhibition of the immune response is released, including the
anti-tumor immune response, with resultant tumor recognition by the cytotoxic T cells.

CONFIDENTIA L(Hamid el al, 2013 ).
For additional information, refer to the Pembr olizumab Investigator’s Brochure.
With: 
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal 
antibody  (mA b) with high specificity  of binding to the programmed cell death 1 
(PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro 
data, pembrolizumab has high affinity  and potent receptor blocking activity  for 
PD-1.  Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety  profile and is in clinical 
development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy  for advanced malignancies.  
Keytruda™ (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a 
number of indications.  For more details on specific indications refer to the 
Pembrolizu mab Investigator’s Brochure.
Section: 2.5 Rationale, Paragraph 1 :
Replace: To date, anti -PD-1 antibodies have been approved for melanoma 
(unresectable or metastatic that progressed following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 
mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor), and for squamous NSCLC (metastatic disease that 
progressed on or after platinum -based chemotherapy).  They have also shown, and are 
further investig ated, for promising single agent activity in other selected solid and 
hematological malignancies.  Most patients still, however, do not show a response to the 
monotherapy.
With: To date, anti -PD-1 antibodies have been approved for a number of 
indications. How ever, the majority  of patients do not sho w a response to 
monotherapy .

Amendment Date:   03 October 2016 
Rationale:  
The following updates were made to the protocol dated 11 December 2015 to 
incorporate requested changes from EU VHP review:  
• Updated Safety Follow Up period from 30 days to 135 days after last study 
treatment throughout the protocol.  
• Added a Dose Rationale section for AMG 820 ( Section 2.2.4) and corresponding 
Table of Contents entry. 
• Clarified important identified risks, important potential risks, and referred to most 
current IB for AMG 820 in Risk Assessment Section 2.3. 
• Added new exclusion criterion to exclude subjects  with active infection within 
2 weeks prior to study enrollment. 
• Added new exclusion criterion to exclude subjects who have received systemic  
immunostimulatory agents within 6 weeks or five half-l ives, whichever is shorter, 
prior to first dose of study treatment (except anti PD -1/PD -L1 treatment if 
recruited into Group 4a or 4b) . 
• Modi fied existing exclusion criteria to also exclude subjects with prior stem cell 
transplantation. 
• Modi fied existing exclusion criteria to also exclude subjects who have other 
signs or symptoms of clinical immune system suppression.  
• Part o f an existing exclusion criterion was updated to be a stand-alone criterion 
(previ ously part of Exclusion 205, the following is now Exclusion 206: receiving 
systemic immunosuppressive therapy (> 2 weeks) within 7 days prior to the first 
dose of study treatment, including oral steroid doses > 10 mg/day of prednisone 
or equivalent except for management of adverse events during the course of the 
study. Subjects that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injection will not be excluded from the study ). 
• Updated exclusion criteria to include only highly effective methods of birth 
control which are in accordance with CTFG’s recommendations (removed 
statements regarding barrier methods of contraception as being acceptable). 
• Updated exclusion criteria to define women and men of reproductive potential or 
childbearing potential , respectively.

any Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia with bleeding, and Grade 4 or higher 
thrombocytopenia lasting >48 hours or any thrombocytopenia requiring intervention is  considered a DLT. 
• Updated Schedule of Assessments to require urine pregnancy test prior to each 
infusion for women of childbearing potential. 
• Updated Schedule of Assessments and relevant areas of protocol to require MRI of brain for subjects with NSCLC at screening.  
• Updated Reasons for Removal from Treatment to include “pregnancy” and “potential hepatotoxicity” (in accordance with section 6.4.1). 
• Removed reference not cited in protocol.  
• Corrected spelling and grammatical errors throughout protocol. 
• Table of Contents page numbers updated at page 26 and beyond to reflect addition of Section 2.2.4 AMG 820 Dose Rationale.

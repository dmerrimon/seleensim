1. Introduction  
This document is a protocol of a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards for Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government r egulations and 
Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 1.1 Background Asthma is among the most prevalent chronic diseases in the U.S. (1 ) and represents a source of 
significant burden to patients and healthcare systems. Acute exacerbation of asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, bronchoconstriction, increased production of airway mucous, and decreased mucociliary clearance with fo rmation of mucous plugs (2, 3) . While 
corticosteroids are often the treatment of choice, their use is associated with a number of adverse effects, particularly when administered systemically. Currently there is an unmet need for non-steroidal treatment options for asthma, and Vitamin E has been proposed as one such treatment to combat inflammatory features of asthma.   
Among the isoforms of vitamin E that can be tested in asthma are α -tocopherol (αT), the 
predominant isoform found in over the counter Vitamin E supplements, and gamma tocopherol (γT), the predominant isoform found in foods. Intervention trials of αT in hum ans with asthma 
have been generally disappointing (4, 5). However, γT and its primary metabolite 2,7,8-
trimethyl-2- (B-carboxy-ethyl)-6- hydroxychroman (γ -CEHC) have been shown to have a number 
of anti- inflammatory activities not observed with αT and its met abolites (6-10). These actions 
include scavenging reactive nitrogen species to form 5 -nitro -y-tocopherol (5- NO2 -γT) (6) and 
inhibition of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX -2) and 5-lipooxygenase, reducing inflammatory 
eicosanoid production (7 -9).  
Particulate matter (PM) is a leading cause of respiratory tract and cardiovascular disease in the United States and world -wide. Wood smoke particles (WSP) derived from wildland and other 
fires account for a significant fraction of ambient air PM. Health effects associated with WSP include acute bronchitis, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, cough and systemic inflammation. While these effects are seen in both healthy and asthmatic individuals, many studies indicate that asthmatics have increased susceptibility  to the effects of WSP. Our center has developed a 500 
μg/m3 WSP exposure protocol (levels similar to those encountered by firefighters and residents

 in close proximity to wildland burn sites) that induces airway and systemic inflammation in 
healthy volunteers. As with other pollutants, these inflammatory responses modulate non-specific bronchial reactivity (NSBR), inflammatory cell recruitment to the airways (primarily neutrophils), and potentially cardiovascular function. 
Our team has focused on gamma tocopherol as a nutritional intervention to prevent inflammatory 
responses to air pollutants such as WSP. Building on animal and in vitro preclinical studies, we have established that 1400 mg/day of oral γT -enriched supplement for 7 and 14 days in healthy 
volunteers and mild asthmatics, respectively, inhibited neutrophil influx into the airways, reduced production of sputum mucins, and improved mucociliary clearance following challenge with inhaled endotoxin, another common component of PM (10, 11). The findings occurred in the context of significantly increased plasma concentrations of γT and its active metabolite γ -
CEHC. Given our findings in these early phase clinical trials, γT supplementation is an attractive approach to prevent WSP -induced adverse health effects. We propose to use γT supplementation 
in a human model of WSP inhalation to mitigate key features of airway inflammation: inflammatory cell recruitment, production of inflammatory cytokines and mucous, and changes in airway physiology.  1.2. Investigational Agent  
 Gamma E Gems 548 mg softgels ,  (J.R. Carlson Laboratories, Inc., 600 W University Drive 
Arlington Heights, IL 60004.)  1.3. Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  Gamma tocopherol will be administered in softgel form, with each softgel containing 874.1 mg of tocopherols, , including:  Alpha Tocopherol: 141.0 mg/sg (softgel) Beta Tocopherol:   18.1 mg/sg Gamma Tocopherol:  548.0 mg/sg  Delta Tocopherol:  167.0 mg/sg  Subjects will consume two softgels by mouth once daily for 7 days. This dosing regimen was 
chosen based on the results of our previous early phase clinical trials examining the impact of gamma tocopherol on LPS- induced airway inflammation in healthy adults (11) and adults with 
asthma (26). These studies tested a 7 and 14 day course of treatment, respectively, and found similar plasma  concentrations of  γT and active metabolites in both studies. Furthermore, we 
showed in both studies that γT significantly reduced LPS-induced sputum neutrophilia compared to placebo. Based on our previous findings, we will now study the efficacy of γT for mitigating WSP- induced airway inflammation.   
 We have discussed the potential benefits of γT supplementation for protection against ambient air pollutant -induced airway inflammation in healthy volunteers and adults with mild asthma in 
section 1.1. In terms of risk, the most significant safety concern for Vitamin E supplements in general is increased bleeding risk, and most trials have used supplements containing predominantly αT as opposed to γT. The Alpha Tocopherol Beta Carotene cancer prevention

 study, a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of αT and b-carotene supplementation 
in middle aged male smokers, found that alpha tocopherol supplementation was associated with increased risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage (13). To our knowledge, there are no published 
studies of γT supplementation that show an increased risk of bleeding. In our own previous studies, we have not observed any significant bleeding events nor any changes in PT, aPTT, or INR with γT supplementation at doses simil ar to the proposed study.  
An additional area of concern was raised by findings from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a population-based observational study. In this study, higher plasma γT levels in young adults (not taking Vitamin E supplements)  were 
associated with lower lung function measurements ( FEV
1 and FVC) (14). However, others have 
shown that increased dietary  vitamin E intake had protective effects on lung function in adults 
(15). Plasma γT levels have not been significantly associated with risk of asthma or asthma 
outcomes. However, increased dietary vitamin E, which is predominantly gamma tocopherol (γT), has been associated with decreased occurrence of asthma in both children (16-18) and adults (19). 
Based on our own previous studies, the most common adverse effects of γT are diarrhea, 
flatulence, abdominal bloating, and nausea. In our most recent randomized, placebo controlled crossover study evaluating 14 days of γT -enriched supplementation (1400 mg daily) in 23 adult 
volunteers with asthma (26), diarrhea was reported in 6 participants (26%) on active treatment, compared to 1 participant (4.3%) on placebo. Nausea was reported in 6 participants (26%) on active treatment, compared to 2 participants (8.7 %) on placebo. Bloating and flatulence were 
reported in 2 participants (8.7%) and 1 participant (4.3%) on active treatment, respectively, with no reports of these symptoms in subjects receiving placebo. One participant withdrew from the study due to intole rable gastrointestinal symptoms. In all other participants, gastrointestinal 
symptoms were transient in nature, beginning after the first or second dose of study drug and self-resolving despite continued treatment for the 14 -day period.  
 2. Study Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of gamma tocopherol for mitigating inhaled WSP-induced airway inflammation in healthy adults and mild asthmatics, 
specifically airway inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine production, mucous production, and non- specific bronchial reactivity.  
     3. Study Design  3.1. General Design This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of gamma tocopherol for mitigating features of airway inflammation induced by inhaled WSP by examining airway inflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine production, and mucous production,. We anticipate 3 years will be 
required for completion of study visits for all participants.

 Upon successful completion of two screening protocols (one as a general screen to determine 
eligibility for airway challenge studies and a second to identify those individuals who are deemed “responders” to WSP inhalation, defined as ≥10% increase in sputum PMNs following exposure), participants will be enrolled to participate in a randomized, double blinded , placebo-
controlled, crossover study consisting of 8 visits . Participants will be randomized to γT or 
placebo treatment followed by chamber exposure with WSP. After a 4 -week washout period, 
participants will cross  over to the alternate treatment group.  
Following randomization to placebo or gamma tocopherol treatment, subjects will return for b
aseline (V0 ) and training visits (V1). Participants will consume 1 400 mg of γT -enriched 
supplement or placebo once daily for 7 days. Participants will undergo WSP exposure (V 2), then 
return the following day for a 24 hour post- exposure visit (V 3). After a 4 week wash out period, 
subjects will present for a review of medical history and adverse events and cross over to the alternate treatment (V4). They will undergo a second WSP exposure (V 5) followed by a 24 hour 
post- exposure visit (V 6). Five to 10 days after the exposure, participants will return for a study 
completion visit (V7 ).  
 3.2. Primary Study Endpoint The primary endpoint will be change in sputum %PMNs [Δ  (post WSP (4 hr) – preWSP)[ γT] vs

 Safety Endpoints: Safety endpoints include respiratory symptoms such as wheezing or shortness 
of breath requiring albuterol, significant bleeding events, or significant change in blood 
coagulation markers (PT, aPTT) such that these measurements are outside of normal range, and adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs). Exploratory safety endpoints include GI symptoms with γT vs Placebo. Adverse event data will be collected through 7 days post study drug treatment for both treatment periods. UNC Chapel Hill Human Research Protection Program Standard Operating Procedures will be followed for reporting adverse events/unanticipated problems to the Biomedical IRB.  All SAEs will be reported to the CDER of 
the FDA as well as to the UNC Biomedical IRB within 24 hours of recognition of the event. Adverse events will be reported to both the FDA and UNC IRB on no less than an annual basis, 
or when the protocol is completed.    
3.4.1. C
riteria for safety prior to initiation of wood smoke inhalation challenge 
(Subjects not meeting these criteria the morning of challenge will not proceed with wood smoke 
inhalation challenge):

hours) consistent with lung function of persons with no more than mild intermittent or mild persistent asthma.   
2. Baseline oxygen saturation of at least 93%.  
3. No history of viral respiratory tract symptoms within 4 weeks of challenge.  
4. No current symptoms of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal or ocular pruritus consistent with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.  
3.4.2. Criteria for safety of a given individual following challenge which would suspend the individual from further participation in the study will include : 
1. No greater than 25% relative decrease in FEV
1 or FVC from WSP pre -challenge values, 
which does not improve within the first 2 hours of challenge.  
2. FEV 1 must recover without treatment to within 90 % of baseline within 24 hours. 
3. A symptom score no greater than 45 (representing a ranking of “moderate” on each of 15 
criteria, with a maximum score of 60, see section 5.2.8. below) with improvement to a 
score of 15 or less within 6 hours without therapy. 
4. Specifically, no symptom score greater than “moderate” (3 on a scale of 0 -4) for 
shortness of breath or cough at 24 hours post-challenge. 
5. Oxygen saturation of ≥ 93% throughout the exposure period. 
6. If albuterol therapy is needed more than once during an observation period. 
7. Any significant abnormalities in PT and a PTT during the treatment periods will be 
assessed and reported to CD ER, IRB, and the funding agency. 
 Criteria for safety within the entire protocol (failure of which would result in suspension of further study until consultation with the CDER of the FDA and the UNC IRB) will include the following:

11 
 1. The study will be suspended if 3 of the first 10 participants fail the individual safety 
criteria outlined above. If this occurs, the study will remain suspended until consultation with the CDER of the FDA.  
2. Once 10 subjects have been enrolled, study suspension will occur if more than 25% of all participants fail the individual safety criteria outlined above  
3. No occurrence of any SAE 
 
Subjects will be under direct supervision for 6 hours from the start of WSP challenge and will 
have contact information for after- hours access to a study physician.  In the event of an 
unexpected event, such as wheezing or bronchospasm, the physician will follow the usual medical standard of care to treat the subject.   
 4. Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
Preliminary results from our screening WSP exposure study have shown that approximately 57% of healthy volunteers were responsive to the inflammatory effects of WSP. Based on this 
experience, we estimate we will need to screen 50 volunteers to identify 28 who are responsive to inhaled WSP. Anticipating at attrition rate of 20%, we will need to identify 35 volunteers for the intervention study, requiring an overall screen of a minimum of 64 volunteers. There will be no gender or ethnic restrictions. The target completion goal is 28 healthy volunteers  and mild 
asthmatics. Individuals who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment as study participants.  
 4.1. Inclusion Criteria  1. Age 18-45 years, inclusive, of both genders 2. Negative pregnancy test for females who are not s/p hysterectomy with oopherectomy 3. FEV

  and blood pressure within the following limits: (Systolic between 
150-85 mmHg, Diastolic between 90 -50 mmHg).  
5. Ability to provide an induced sputum sample. 6. Subject must demonstrate a ≥ 10% increase in sputum neutrophils following inhaled WSP 
exposure, when compared to baseline sputum (to be completed in a separate protocol). 7.

c. If there is a history of allergic rhinitis, subjects must be asymptomatic of allergic rhinitis at the time of study enrollment.  
d. Mental illness or history of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator,  would interfere with the participant’s ability to comply with study 
requirements.  
e. Cigarette smoking > 1 pack per month 
f. Unwillingness to use if sexually active (IUD,  implant, sterilization, or when used 
in combination: birth control pills/patch and barrier methods). (i.e., those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly). Note that male condom use, hormonal contraceptive pills, or hormonal contraceptive patches used alone have estimated failure rates that do not meet these criteria.  
g. Abnormal PT or aPTT values at screening or during the treatment period. Normal values will  be those published by the clinical lab (Labcorp, INC). 
h. Use of immunosuppressive or a nticoagulant medications includ ing routine use of 
NSAIDS.  Oral contraceptives are acceptable, as are Antidepressants and other 
medications may be  permitted if, in the opinion of the investigator, the medication

n. Positive test for Covid 19 in the past 90 days 
2. Pregnant/nursing women and children (< 18 years as this is age of majority in N orth 
Carolina ) will also be excluded since the risks associated with woodsmoke exposure to 
the fetus or child, respectively, are unknown and cannot be justified for this non-therapeutic protocol. Individuals over 45 years of age will not be included due to the 
increased possibility of co -morbidities and need for prohibited medications.  
3. Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent. 
 4.3. Withdrawal or Termination  
Participants will be terminated early from the study for the following reasons:  
1. The participant elects to withdraw consent from all future study activities including follow up. 
2. The participant is “lost to follow up” (i.e., no further follow up is possible because attempts to reestablish contact with the participant have failed).  
3. The participant dies.  
4. The participant develops a medical condition or is started on a new medication(s) not previously mentioned in the list of prohibited medications that, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant’s ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality of the data obtained from the study. 
5. The participant meets any of the individual stopping rules as delineated. 
6. The study is terminated for any reason. 
Participants with early termination from this study will not be replaced.  
5. Study Procedures  
 
5.1. Schedule of Events  
Each subject will have 8 study visits (excluding the general screening visit and wood smoke 
exposure screening visit to identify responders, which are under separate protocols): 
 5.1.1. S
creening Visits 
General Screening :  To identify non- asthmatic and asthmatic subjects suitable for WSP exposure, 
subjects will complete a general screening protocol (UNC IRB approved study #98-0799, Database and Screening Protocol for Research Studies of the Center for Environmental Medicine & Lung Biology ). 
 Screening WSP exposure :
  This protocol will identify subjects who experience a ≥ 10% increase 
in sputum neutrophilia after WSP exposure, compared to baseline sputum (UNC IRB approved study #15-1775, To identify persons who are susceptible to WSP-induced inflammation and examine the role of GSTM1 and other factors in this susceptibility ). This protocol involves a 
detailed review of the subject’s medical history and medication use, lung function (spirometry), collection of an induced sputum sample, and WSP exposure.

In this case, if V1 occurs >1 month from V0, or if V4 occurs >2 months from V3, to prioritize participant safety we will bring the subject in for an additional visit to collect safety labs, perform spirometry, and review interval history.  
If the participant has an illness mid -dosing of the gamma tocopherol/placebo or fails to adhere to 
the dosing regimen, participants will return 4 weeks after they have taken their last dose or 4 weeks after resolution of symptoms.  At that visit, gamma tocopherol/placebo will be re -
dispensed.  To prioritize participant safety we will review interval history.  S ubjects with an 
illness during dosing, we will additionally collect safety labs, and perform spirometry.

 5.2. Protocols for Measurements and Observations  
 5.2.1 Woodsmoke particle chamber exposure  
We will employ the exposure protocol described by (20) .
  We will heat white oak wood on an 
electric heating element (Brinkmann, Dallas, Texas, USA)  in a Quadrafile 3100 woodstove 
(Colville, Washin gton, USA) to generate wood smoke. The smoke wil l be extracted from the 
chimney and injected into the chamber air stream, and wood smoke particle concentration will be

17 
 controlled using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Franklin, Massachusetts, USA) to measure the chamber concentration. A DustTrak 8530 aerosol 
monitor (TSI, Shoreview, Minnesota, USA ) will also be used as an alternative monitor for 
independent verification of proper TEOM  operation. The particle number concentration will be 
measured with a Model 3022A CPC (TSI, Shoreview, Minnesota, USA) and the number and size 
distribution will be measured with a Model 3080L SMPS (TSI). The particle concentration will be verified by weighing filters obtained using a versatile air pollution sampler (VAPS; URG, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA). The chamber temperature and humidity will be controlled to approximately 22°C and 40%, respectively. The target average concentration of WSP we will use for this  study will be  500 μg/m
3, with mild exercise to increase minute ventilation (20 
L/min/m2 BSA) for 15 minute periods, alternating with 15 min ute rest periods across an overall 2 
hour total exposure period.   5
.2.2. Induced sputum  
Sputum samples will be collected using a specific sputum induction protocol in which FEV 1 and 
FVC will be measured to determine the baseline FEV 1 and FVC values. Asthmatic individuals 
will be pretreated with 2 to 4 puffs of albuterol prior to the procedure, and post-albuterol spirometry will be collected . The FEV
1 values that match a 10% and 20% fall from baseline will 
be calculated. An ultrasonic nebulizer will be filled with 15 mL of 3% hypertonic saline (inhalation grade for respiratory use only) to begin the test. The nebulizer will be set to the maximum output setting and turned on. The subject wi ll be instructed to breathe normally (i.e. 
tidal breaths) through the nebulizer mouthpiece for 7 minutes. The saline will be nebulized through the mouthpiece in a jet stream and inhaled. The nose will not be occluded for this procedure. Prior to expectoration, subjects will blow their nose, rinse their mouth with water, and clear their throat to avoid the inclusion of non -airway fluid samples. The subject will also be 
encouraged to come off the mouthpiece at any time to cough if a sputum sample from the low er 
airways (i.e. not from the back of the throat) is ready for expectoration. The sample will be coughed into a sterile specimen jar and capped. Following repeat measurement of FEV
1 after the 
first 7 minute inhalation period, the concentration of saline will be increased from 3% to 4%, provided the FEV
1 falls by <10% from the baseline value. The same procedure will be followed 
for the final 7 minute inhalation period using 5% hypertonic saline. The nebulization will be stopped at that point, or earlier, if a sputum sample of good quality is obtained (i.e. visible sputum plugs). The 4% and 5% saline solutions will be mixed for each induction by study staff just prior to induction and a volume of 15-20 mL will be used on each occasion.  
5.2.3. Spirometry  
Spirometry will be performed according to A merican Thoracic S ociety  guidelines. Subjects will 
inhale as deeply as possible, then exhale as rapidly and completely as possible into the 
spirometer. Measurements obtained from each maneuver include the FVC, the FEV
1, the 
maximal mid -expiratory flow rate (FEF 25 -75%) and the peak flow (PF). The largest FVC and 
FEV 1, from at least 3 acceptable trials will be selected for analysis and subject must meet the 
appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria based on comparison of the subject’s measurements to the predicted value for an individual of his/her gender, age, race and height with NHANES III as the predicted set.  
5.2.4. Flow mediated dilation measured by brachial artery ultrasound: 
Gamma Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and airway inflammatory responses, IND 136873 
Sponsor:  David Peden, MD, MS 
 
18 
 Vascular endothelial function will be assessed by measuring flow- mediated dilation of the 
brachial artery . Ultrasound images of the right brachial artery proximal to the antecubital fossa 
will be acquired using a Philips EPIQ 7 ultrasound machine equipped with a high-frequency (L9-
3) broadband linear-array transduc er. The baseline images will be obtained after 10 minutes of 
supine rest. Flow -mediated (endothelium- dependen t) dilation will be assessed by determining the 
change in arterial diameter in response to reactive hypere mia. Reactive hyperemia will be 
induced by inflating a pneumatic occlusion cuff placed around the upper fore arm to a 
suprasystolic pressure (approximately 200 mmHg) for five minutes. Images of the artery will be 
recorded for two minutes after cuff deflation. Gated end- diastolic images will be stored in a 
digital format on a personal computer for subsequent offline quantification. Measurements will be performed using customized software (Brachial Tools, Medical Imaging Applications, LLC). 
Arterial diameter will be measured from the lumen -intimal interfaces of the proximal and distal 
arterial walls. Data from at least ten end -diastolic frames wi ll be averaged for the baseline 
measurement and from at least three frames at maximum dilation during  reactive hyperemia 
FMD will be calculated as the percent change in diameter from baseline.  
 5.2.5. Left ventricular strain  
LV strain  will be assessed by measuring global longitudinal strain using 2-dimensional speckle 
tracking echocardiography.  Speckle tracking imaging is a relatively new technique with which myocardial mechanics can be quantified by tracking groups of intramyocardial speckles.  Global longitudinal strain, the average fractional change in myocardial segment length, is a more sensitive index of LV contractility than ejection fraction or other standard measures.  Apical 4 -
chamber, 2-chamber, and long axis 2- dime nsional ultrasound images of the heart will be 
acquired using a Philips EPIQ 7 ultrasound machine and stored for subsequent off-line analysis.  Global longitudinal strain will be quantified using Philips QLAB advanced quantification software.

 6. Statistical Plan  
 
6.1 Sample Size Determination  
The primary endpoint of this study is Δ sputum %PMNs  (post WSP – pre WSP [ γT]) at 4 hour 
vs (post WSP – pre WSP [ placebo])  at 4 hours,  and ( post WSP – pre WSP [ γT]) at 24 hours vs 
(post WSP – pre WSP [ placebo]) at 24 hours. Preliminary analyses from our screening study of 
the effects of 500 µg/m3 WSP exposure on sputum neutrophilia in healthy volunteers and mild 
asthmatics demonstrated that , among “responders ” (those participants with a ≥ 10% increase in 
sputum neutrophils following WSP exposure), the mean increase in sputum %PMNs was 
28.5±1 3%. In our studies of γT vs placebo for mitigating LPS -induced change in sputum 
%PMNs in healthy volunteers (11) and mild asthmatics (26), we found a γT treatment effect size of 14.5% ±25.9. Assuming β =0.8 and α=0.05, a sample size of 28 healthy volunteers and mild 
asthmatics would be required to detect the same γT  treatment effect size. To account for a 25% 
attrition rate with human studies, we will inflate the sample size to 35 healthy volunteers and mild asthmatics . Importantly, we anticipate that we will de crease subject variability by only 
recruiting  persons with ≥ 10% increase in WSP -induced %PMNs in sputum during the screeing 
protoco l (the so -called “responders”).  
 6.2. S
tatistical Methods 
Our analytic plan was developed in collaboration with Dr. Zhou, the biostatistician for the CEMALB, who will oversee all statistical analysis.  For analysis of sputum and circulating PMN 
responses as well as cytokine changes within each treatment group, we will use (i) descriptive analy sis, (ii) two -sample comparison test, and (iii) random effects regression analysis (Equation 
1) designed to take advantage of the crossover design (22). Specifically, we will use the tabular and graphic methods to describe/explore the basic relationship between the groups. We will then 
follow up by comparing the Δ sputum %PMNs (post WSP – pre WSP [ γT]) vs (post WSP – 
pre WSP [ placebo]) using two -sample tests,  either parametric (T -Test) or nonparametric 
(Wilxocon signed- rank test ), depending on whether the normality assumption is met. We 
will transform the data to achieve normality if needed. Finally , we will employ a random 
effect  regression modeling technique  (Equation 1 ) that allow s us to assess treatment effect while 
accounting for potential period effect and carry- over effect s. This approach is similar to those we 
have previously described to assess genotype effects (including the  GSTM1 null genotype) on 
response to pollutants  (11, 23-25) and is shown below . In all analyses, criterion  for significance 
will be p≤0.05. To address potential missing data, we will employ multiple imputation methods  
to address this issue when appropriate; using techniques we have previously described (24).   
Linear mixed model approach for global unified analysis of data for secondary and exploratory outcomes: 
    
 
  
 Y_11k=μ+π_1+τ_1+βX_k+s_1k+ ϵ_11k; Y_12k=μ+π_2+τ_2+λ_1+βX_k+s_1k+ ϵ_12k 
 
Y_21k=μ+π_1+τ_2+βX_k+s_2k+ ϵ_21k; Y_22k=μ+π_2+τ_1+λ_2+βX_k+s_2k+ ϵ_22k     
 
μ is the grand mean, π1 and π2 are period effects, τ1 and τ2 are treatment effects, λ 1 and λ2 
are carryover effects for different sequences, ς1k and ς 2k are individual random effects 
within each sequence, and ε's are random errors. Subscript k is for subjects.

6.3. Data Management Study coordinators will be responsible for efforts and computations for database management. 
Data will be initially collected by study coordinators on paper documents. Clinical data such as health history will be collected by study staff as interview or directly measured, such as vital signs, spirometry, etc. All paper forms (source documentation) are maintained by a study coordinator or PI in a binder, 1 binder per subject. All data will be entered into REDCap by a study coordinator within 2 weeks of collection, and will be verified by a 2
nd person within 4 
weeks to ensure accuracy and completeness. REDCap is a secure web application developed at Vanderbilt University and can be used to collect virtually any type of data (including 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, and HIPAA-compliant environments). It is specifically geared to support online or offline data capture for research studies and operations. Missing data will be noted and a comment made in the database to explain the missing data. Time stamps will be used wh en 
appropriate. At minimum, the visit number will be indicated.   Biological samples collected by coordinators will be delivered to the CEMALB lab by the coordinators in properly labeled containers. On receipt in the lab, samples are initially entered into a software program called LDMS (Lab Data Management System) which  tracks samples. 
Processing of these samples is done per the SOP maintained in the CEMALB quality assurance plan, as some samples are processed immediately and others are processed in batches at later time points. This data is entered into REDCap at appropriate intervals, based on sample analysis.  
 We will use the data dictionary or REDCap codebook as our course for data codes. All data will be collected by qualified staff using CEMALB SOPs and will be entered into REDCap. Once the data is entered and confirmed by a 2
nd person, it will be considered “locked” and will not be 
changed without documentation with the reason for the change. REDCap limits and monitors who can change data, a feature developed to ensure data integrity.  6.4. Randomization plan The randomization schedule will be generated by Dr. Haibo Zhou (biostatistician) and provided to the investigational pharmacy. Only Dr. Zhou and the pharmacist will have access to the randomization schedule. Subjects will be allocated to begin the first period of the crossover study with placebo or γT  treatment using permuted block randomization with a block size of 4 (2 
placebo, 2 γT  for the first treatment period of the protocol).  
 
7. Monitoring and Risk Minimization  
 
7.1. Definition of Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded and reported according to 21 CFR 312.32. An adverse event for a given volunteer will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug whether or not considered drug related and will also include failure of any of the safety criteria outlined in section “3.4.”.  Additionally, minor upper 
respiratory tract infections occurring within 96 hours of the exposure will be considered adverse events.  Other non- specified clinical illnesses or symptoms , which occur during the treatment 
period or within 96 hours of each challenge, will also be reported as an AE.  Any decrease in lung function or increase in symptom score, as outlined in section “3.4,” will be considered an 
Gamma Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and airway inflammatory responses, IND 136873 
Sponsor:  David Peden, MD, MS 
 
23 
 adverse event. Any symptoms that induce a volunteer to seek medical attention from any 
provider during study drug treatment or within 7 days of completing study drug treatment or  
within 96 hours of challenge will be considered an adverse event.  A serious adverse event will also be defined as any event that requires hospitalization or results in life threatening illness or injury, permanent (or likely to be permanent) illness or injury, or death if these events occur 
during study drug treatment or within 7 days of completing study drug treatment or within 96 hours of challenge (or if the clinical scenario leading up to hospitalization, illness, injury or death begins during study drug treatment, within 7 days of completing study drug treatment or within  
96 hours of a challenge).   
7.1.1. Grading criteria  
In addition to determining whether an adverse event fulfills criteria for a serious adverse event or 
not, the severity of adverse events experienced by study participants will be graded according to 
the criteria set forth in the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials  except for those items listed in 7.1.2 below.   This 
document provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.   
All adverse events whether or not listed in the Toxicity Grading Scale will be graded on a scale from 1 to 4  according to the following standards (A semi- colon indicates ‘or’ within the 
description of the grade.): Grade 1 = Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2 = Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL (preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc). 
Grade 3 = Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using he toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
Grade 4 = Life-threatening consequences; or urgent intervention indicated.  
7.1.2. Protocol specific potential AE’s  
Adverse events which have relative specificity for this protocol will be recorded and graded 1 to 4 according to the grade definition provided below:   
 Mild  
(Grade 1) Moderate  
(Grade 2) Severe  
(Grade 3) Potentially life -

7.2. Risks to Subjects 
 7.2.1. Potential risks of gamma tocopherol  
There is a rare chance that higher doses of αT may effect coagulation (PT and a PTT) and 
predispose to bleeding. It is possible that γT carries the same risk , though this has not been 
demonstrated in prior studies of γT. An observational study of un- supplemented individuals 
suggested that higher plasma γT levels were associated with reduced lung function, specifically FVC and FEV
1 (14) . Finally, our prior studies with γT have demonstrated risk for mild 
gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, bloating, and flatulence  that tended to 
occur early on during treatment and to self- resolve within a few days despite continued 
treatment. In our most recent randomized, placebo controlled crossover study evaluating 14 days of γT supplementati on in adults with asthma, diarrhea was reported in 26% of subjects on active 
treatment, compared to 4.3% of subjects on placebo.  
 
7.2.2. Potential risks of WSP  
Concentrations of wood smoke exhaust proposed for this study (500 μg/m3) are below those reported for individuals using biomass burning for heating and food preparation and those living 
in the area of a forest fire or agricultural burning. No major adverse health effects were observe d 
in a recently completed study which exposed healthy volunteers to concentrated C hapel Hill air 
particles at the EPA Human Studies facility (Physiological and Biochemical Changes Associated 
with Exposure to Air Pollution Partic les; Andrew Ghio, MD, PI; IRB# 95- EPA -310)1. The mean 
particulate matter (PM) was 485 + 84 μg/m
3 during the WSP exposure (vs. “below the detectable 
limit” for filtered air (FA)), and analyses of chamber concentrations of total hydrocarbon and 
carbon monoxide during WSP exposure were also increased compared to FA (4.8 ± 0.5 vs. 2.0 ± 0.1 ppm and 2.7 ± 0.7 vs. 0.0 ± 0.0 ppm, respectively). However, these healthy subjects had no significant change in pulmonary function and no nasal irritation, rhinitis, inspiratory pain, 
Gamma Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and airway inflammatory responses, IND 136873 
Sponsor:  David Peden, MD, MS 
 
25 
 shortness of breath, cough, wheezing or chest tightness after exposure to WSP or filtered air. 
There were complaints of fatigue, headache and eye irri tation, but these were noted by volunteers 
as frequently before as after both the filtered air and particl e exposures. Pulmonary function 
testing demonstrated no significant changes from pre-exposure values following exposures to either filtered air or WSP.  
There is potential for increased airway inflammation in asthmatics. Thus, we are limiting inclusion to mild asthmatics only. Seven participants with asthma have completed an ongoing screening protocol (UNC IRB approved study #15-1775, To identify persons who are susceptible to WSP-induced inflammation and examine the role of GSTM1 and other factors in this susceptibility)  to identify mild asthmatics who experience a ≥ 10% increase in sputum 
neutrophilia after WSP exposure for inclusion into this study. In addition to the mild, transient symptoms experienced by healthy volunteers as noted above, these seven asthmatic participants have experienced transient chest tightness following WSP exposure. This symptom has not been accompanied by any significant changes in spirometry, and chest tightness has resolved spontaneously within a few minutes following exposure and without any intervention. We will assess for any symptoms following WSP exposure with the WSP exposure questionnaire immediately after exit from the chamber and again 4 hours later. Spirometry will also be performed immediately following exit from the chamber with additional spirometry to be performed for any persistent symptoms and/or physician discretion. If FEV1 drops by 20% or more immediately afte r wood smoke exposure, or if the subject has intolerable symptoms, 
albuterol will be given for rescue. Finally, our Center has previously performed inhaled challenges with ozone and LPS in the allergic asthmatic population. With ozone and LPS we have not e xperienced any serious adverse events, and we expect the response to the wood smoke 
challenge to be similar.   7.2.3. Potential Risks of the Induced Sputum Procedure  
The saline solutions (3%, 4% and 5%) nebulized during sputum may cause throat irritation, but it is uncommon for the duration of discomfort to last more than a few minute s post procedure. The 
procedure also has a minimal risk of inducing bronchospasm, which is a potential concern for individuals with asthma. Thus, all volunteers with a history of asthma will be pre -treated with 2 -
4 puffs of albuterol prior to beginning sputum induction. Additional albuterol is employed as a rescue agent if needed, and a physician is available for all sputum induction procedures.   7.2.4. Potential Risks of Spirometry  
Potential risks include possible lightheadedness or wheezing . 
 The adhesive patches used during monitoring may cause itching or skin irritation.  7.2.5. Potential Risks of Measuring Flow Mediated Dilation with Brachial Artery Ultrasound There are no significant risks associated with ultrasound imaging of the brachial artery, or with the 5 minutes of reduced blood flow that is part of the test. Cutting off blood flow to the arm may result in mild discomfort or temporary sensations of tingling or numbness in the hand u ntil the 
blood pressure cuff is released. About 1 in 200 patients develop a painless rash on the arm w here 
the blood pressure cuff is placed; this disappears over several days.

7.2.6. Potential Risks of Measuring Left Ventricular Strain  
There are no significant risks associated with ultrasound imaging to measure left ventricular strain.  
7.2.7. Potential Risks associated with other study procedures  
Bruising during the venipuncture and vasovagal response to phlebotomy are the anticipated risks of venipuncture. There are no anticipated risks for completion of questionnaires or collection of a urine sample from female subjects.  Light bicycle exercise (used to increase minute ventilation) 
presents a potential, but minimal risk. Side effects of exercise include occasional muscle soreness, cramps or general fatigue. These effects are temporary and not typically harmful to volunteers. It is also possible that exercise might uncover a previously unidentif ied pre -existing 
cardiac condition that could present a health risk to a volunteer.   Additionally there is a risk of Breach of Confidentiality and Privacy.  7.3. Measures to Minimize Risk  
 7.3.1. Protections to Minimize Risk of Gamma Tocopherol  
Tocopherols may affect coagulation. We will query volunteers for bruising and bleeding prior to enrollment and during the dosing period, and will monitor PT and a PTT values prior to t he first 
dose of study drug and at the end of the dosing period. They may be checked at any time the subjects experiences abnormal bruising. Any participant with an abnormal baseline PT, a PTT or 
INR will be excluded from receipt of study treatment. Spirometry is performed at regular intervals throughout the γT dosing period to monitor for any changes in lung function. As to the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, we will recommend that γT supplements be taken with a high- fat meal to promote intestinal absorption of γT and mitigate many associated diarrhea  or 
bloating. Participants will receive a GI symptom diary to be completed daily while taking the study drug and returned to study coordinators on the morning of the challenge visit s (Visit 2 or 
5). All female subjects, except those who have had a hysterectomy with oophorectomy, will 
undergo urine pregnancy testing prior to beginning treatment and prior to WSP exposure . A 
positive pregnancy test will exclude the subject, and they will be withdrawn if they become pregnant during the course of the study. Study medication, including placebo, will be dispensed by the Inve stigational Drug Service of UNC Hospitals.  
 7.3.2. Protections to Minimize Risk of Wood smoke exposure Prior to enrollment, subjects will have completed either the CEMALB screening protocol at which time a  detailed medical history will be  obtained. Only otherwise healthy volunteers who 
meet study  inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered for this study, and the maximum age 
of participants will be 45 years in order to limit the likelihood of occult disease. Subjects will be deferred if they have had a viral upper respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks of exposure 
challenge. Also, unspecified illnesses, which  in the judgment of the investigator increase the 
risks associated with  woodsmoke, will be a basis for exclusion. All subjects will need to fulfill 
objective lung function and symptom criteria outlined above in section 3.4.1. prior to chamber entry. During wood smoke exposure, subjec ts will be monitored by direct o bservation or via 
closed -circuit television. Subjects will have ECG telemetry leads attached to monitor cardiac rate 
and rhythm during exercise throughout the exposure. Subjects will be aware that they can

27 
 terminate their exposure for any reason and still receive compensation for their participation up 
to that point. A physician familiar with the protocol will be available for all challenge procedures. The investigator or duty physician will end the exposure if the subject is found to be suffering fro m any major adverse effect . An emergency “crash cart” with standard emergency 
medications, IV fluids and a defibrillator are is also readily available at the CEMALB in the unlikely event of a medical emergency during any challenge or study visit.   For safety reasons, pulse oximetry will be performed during the exposures to wood smoke and filtered air, and the subject will be withdrawn from th e chamber if the value is <90%. The risk of 
discomfort associated with exercise will be limited because ability and response to exercise will be assessed at the training visit, and subjects with orthopedic issues that limit ability to pedal a 
bicycle will be excluded. All female subjects, except those who have had a hysterectomy with oophorectomy, will undergo ur ine pregnancy testing on the morning (prior to) of each exposure. 
A positive pregnancy test will exclude the subject. Various engineering system controls will be used during woodsmoke exposures. A Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM®) will be used control and monitor wood smoke part icle concentration in the chamber. If the 
concentration measured by the TEOM® exceeds a pr edetermined level, the exposure will be 
terminated and the subject removed from the chamber. A DataRAMTM particulate measurement  
device will also be used during exposure as an alternative monitor for independent verification of proper TEOM® operation. Additionally, gas analyzers continually monitor the chamber environment during exposures and will alarm if the carbon monoxide level exceeds 35 ppm.  7.3.3. Protections to Minimize Risks of the Induced Sputum Procedure  
Throat irritation will be minimized by providing the subject with a drink (wate r, juice etc) and a 
snack after induction. All subjects with a history of asthma will be pretreated with 2 -4 puffs of 
albuterol prior to procedure initiation.  An additional albuterol multidose inhaler will be 
immediately available in the event the subject experiences symptoms of bronchoconstriction. A physician on duty in the facility will be available during sputum inductions. If the covering physician feels that the subject’s respiratory status is such that providing an induced sputum sample would place them at increased risk for significant bronchospasm, sputum sampling will be deferred. Baseline FEV
1 and force vital capacity (FVC) will be measured before the start of 
the induction and at the end of each level (concentration) of saline inhalation. The FEV 1 values 
that match a 10% and 20% reduction from baseline will be calculated and recorded. Subjects who have a 10- 20% decrease in FEV
1 after the 3% or 4% level of saline will not be advanced to 
a higher concentration of saline and will continue at the same level. If the FEV 1 drops by > 20%, 
the induction will be stopped and the subje ct will be treated with 2 puffs of albu terol. Additional 
albuterol may be given if needed.  7.3.4. Protections to Minimize Risks of Spirometry  
Subjects will be seated in a non -rolling chair when spirometry is performed and standard 
methodology conforming to the American Thoracic Society guidelines for measurem ent of 
spirometry will be used. Subjects will be instructed to notify the study staff if they feel lightheaded, and albuterol will be available i n the event the subject experiences any 
unanticipated bronchoconstriction.

 If any subject finds this procedure intolerable, he or she will be withdrawn. In the rare event of a 
rash in the area where circulation is restricted, the subject will be monitored until it resolves.  
 7.3.6. Protections to Minimize Risks Associated with Measuring Left Ventricular Strain  
If any subject finds this procedure intolerable, he or she will be withdrawn.  
 7.3.7. Protections to Minimize Risks Associated with Other Study Procedures  
In order to minimize harm from the procedure, venipuncture will only be performed by qualified personnel. Subjects will have access to juice and a small snack after blood draws and will have the opportunity to lie recumbent after the procedure. Subjects with a known serious vagal response to phlebotomy will not be enrolled. A fully stocked medical “crash” cart will be present and readily available in the unlikely event that a major vagal episode occurs. Subjects will be screened for orthopedic injuries or conditions which would increase the likelihood of injury. Additionally, subjects will be trained on the proper use of the bicycle, and w ill be monitored 
during bicycle use.  
 7.3.8. Protections for Minimizing Risks Associated with Breach of Confidentiality and Privacy All phone conversations/i nterviews as well as collection of personal medical history will be 
carried out in private offices or p rivate examination rooms in the CEMALB research facility. All 
physical examinations will be carried out in a private examination room. Access to subject’s identity will be limited to the investigators and staff directly involved in the protocol.  
CRF’s/worksheets generated as part of these studies will be kept in a locked room, and the database will not contain personal identifiers and will also be password protected and acc essible 
only to the appropriate study coordinators and investigators. Subjects’ names will not be used in any publication. Risks to Confidentiality will be also be minimized by labeling samples for in -
house a nalysis with coded identifiers. The ID label for any samples sent outside of the UNC 
Health Care S ystem will be also be cod ed and without any personal identifiers (i.e., no DOB, 
gender etc will be indicated on the tube or lab request form). Clinical blood samples (PT, a PTT, 
WBC) are typically sent to Labco rp INC, Burlington, NC, without identifiers. All subjects are 
discharged to home with 24 hour contact information for a physician who is familiar with the  
study.   7.4. Reporting of AEs and SAEs All SAEs will be reported to the CDER  of the FDA as well as to the UNC Biomedical IRB 
within 24 hours of recognition of the event. Adverse events will be reported to both the FDA and UNC IRB on no less than a quarterly basis, or when the protocol is completed.  If criteria for suspension of t he protocol are met, then the FDA and UNC IRB will be notified within 24 hours.  
All subjects with a non -fatal SAE will be evaluated medically by a study physician, in concert 
with their own physician as appropriate. Likewise all subjects with an adverse event will be examined and evaluated by a study physician. All assessments will in clude the same lung 
function and vital sign assessments outlined for challenge observation. Other assessments will be undertaken as needed. Any unspecified event, which in the judgment of the PI of the study, constitutes an unusual, unexpected or prolonged event (greater than 96 hours) will be reported to 
both the FDA and the UNC IRB.

7.5. Informed Consent   
Investigators and study staff will explain all study procedures and the benefits and risks of the study to potential participants as part of obtaining informed consent. Subjects may withdraw their consent at any time during the study.  If they withdraw from the study it will not impact the care they receive at UNC or its affiliated hospitals and clinics.  
 7.6. Confidentiality   
Risks to subject confidentiality will be minimized by storing records with personal identifiers in an office in CEMALB which is locked when unattended by the study coordinators. All samples will be stored with codes only (no personal identifiers). The CEMA LB is located in the US 
Environmental Protection Agency’s Human Studies Facility on the UNC campus, which has a security guard and limited access 24 hours/day, 7 days/week.   All data and specimens will be coded with unique identifiers assigned to the subject at the time of enrollment, and actual identity cannot be ascertained exclusively from these data. Conversations and interviews with the subject, as well as collection of p ersonal medical history, 
will be carried out in private examination rooms or private offices in the CEMALB research facility. All physical examinations will be carried out in a private examination room. Access to study records containing identifiable priva te information will be provided only to those 
individuals associated with the study who require access to the data to perform their duties. These individuals will have completed ethics training as required by the UNC Biomedical IRB and will be listed on the approved IRB protocol. Records containing PHI will be kept in a locked office.

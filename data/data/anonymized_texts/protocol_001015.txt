Protocol  Synopsis  
Name of Sponsor/Company :   Novartis  
Name of Finished Drug/Device :  Inclisiran for Injection  (also referred to as KJX839),  
Name of Active Ingredient :  Inclisiran sodium  
Title of Study :  A long-term  extension trial of  the Phase III lipid-l owering trials to assess the effect of long-term 
dosing of inclisiran given as subcutaneous injections in subjects with high cardiovascular risk and elevated LDL-C 
(ORION -8 also referred to as CKJX839A12306 B) 
Phase of Development : III 
Study Centers : Global Multicenter study (approximately 300 sites).  
Central Facilities :  This list is maintained by the Sponsor  
Number of Subjects : Maximum of up to 3300 subjects  
Study Period : The estimated study period for the study will be approximately 4 years from first subject enrolled in 
this extension study to last subject completed, or until the investigator's recommendation of discontinuation, 
sponsor's recommendation of discontinuation, until an administrative decision is made to end the study . 
Objectives:   
Primary :  
The primary objective s are to evaluate:  
• The effect of inclisiran treatment on the proportion of subjects achieving prespecified low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol ( LDL-C) targets  at end of study ( EOS )   
• The safety and tolerability profile of long-term use of inclisiran  
Secondary:  
The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of inclisiran on:  
• LDL-C levels  
• Other lipids and lipoproteins  
Methodology :  
This study will be a long-term extension study  in up to 33 00 subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD), ASCVD-risk equivalents (eg, diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) , or heterozygous  
 familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH  ) and elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-
C) despite treatment with  LDL-C lowering therapies who have completed the Phase II trial MDCO -PCS -16-01 
(ORION -3, also referred to as CKJX839A12201E1) or  Phase III lipid lowering studies : MDCO -PCS -17-03(ORION -
9 also referred to as CKJX839A12303), MDCO -PCS -17-04  (ORION -10, also referred to as CKJX839A12304, or 
MDCO -PCS -17-08(ORION -11, also referred to as CKJX839A12305). The purpose of this extension study is  to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of long-term dosing of inclisiran. Informed consent will be obtained from subjects before the initiation of any study -specific procedures. The EOS visit in the previous study will be Day 
1 in ORION -8.  
Subjects completing one of the previously mentioned inclisiran trials  (the Phase II trial (ORION -3,  Phase III 
inclisiran studies (ORION -9, ORION -10 or  ORION -11 trial) and fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria of this 
study will receive blinded inclisiran sodium 300 milligrams  (mg) which is equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran, or blinded 
placebo on Day 1 in this tria ,. except for subjects moving over from ORION -3. These subjects will receive the first 
study medication at day 90.  Subjects who received placebo in the previous  Phase III  feeder study will receive 
blinded inclisiran and subjects who received inclisiran in the previous feeder study will receive blinded placebo at 
this visit , in order to maintain the blinding of the feeder study until database lock of those studies.  For  subjec ts 
enrol led in Sweden, Sweden S pecific Protocol Amendment 1 (to Global Amendment 1 version, dated 1 Nov 2018) 
was implemented to allow limited lab tests to be done on Day 1 and to collect any safety information during the gap between feeder’s EOS and Day1of this study  until ethics  commit tee approval was granted in that country.  
After first study drug administration, all subjects will be observed in the clinic for 30 minutes  post injection before 
being discharged.  
All subjects will return at Day 90 for the next visit and will receive open label inclisiran sodium 300 mg which is 
equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran . Subjects  will then return for open label drug administration of inclisiran sodium 300 
mg every 180 days until EOS  and be observed for 30 minutes at each visit .  
Efficacy assessments will measure the effects of inclisiran on levels of LDL-C .  
At each visit, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), concomitant medications, and safety 
laboratory parameters will be collected.

Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee  (IDMC)  will review safety data on a regular schedule as specified in 
the IDMC charter from subject enrollment in the double-blind phase until the end of the open label phase of the 
study . A recommendation may be taken to stop or amend the study after any of these reviews.  
The duration of each subject is expected to be a maximum of 3 years (or until the investigator’s recommendation 
of discontinuation, sponsor's recommendation of discontinuation, the subject's decision to discontinue for any 
reason, until an administrative decision is made to end the study .. At this time , EOS evaluations will be conducted 
at the EOS visit .

Amendment 2 (06-Oct-2020 ) 
Amendment rationale 
The first subject for this trial was enrolled in April 2019 and enrollment was completed in February 
2020 (with 2991 subjects enrolled).  
This amendment is written to address the change in sponsorship from The Medicine s Company to 
Novartis after acquisition of The Medicine s Company by Novartis in January 2020. At the time of 
this amendment , all subjects in the trial are receiving open label treatment .  Additional changes 
incorporate Novartis processes, language and change in sponsor contacts, allow for flexibility 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Additional changes include: 
• Introduction of Novartis protocol number and IMP code: CKJX83906 and KJX839 
respectively  
• Handling of protocol deviations including those for COVID-19 related issues 
• COVID-19 considerations: remote visits and extended visit windows.    
• Update of section 5.1.5 about reporting of drug and  device deficiencies when using pre filled syringe 
• Incorporation of language about Sweden S pecific Protocol Amendment in Section 3.1 
• Remove section 7.3 Assessment of Pharmacodynamics as deem not relevant  
• Amend ing Section 8.4.3.2 – Pregnancy, to include follow up on newborns for 12 months 
• Additional feeder trial to ORION -8 was added: ORION-3 (also referred to as 
CKJX839A12201E1) subjects can move over to ORION- 8 after completing the treatment in 
the Phase II trial.  
• ORION- 5 was deleted as feeder trial to ORION -8 
Administrative changes were made to the title page, the footer and headers and throughout the protocol to reflect the change in sponsorship and adding the Novartis protocol number and IMP 
code. Additional minor changes to correct typos and provide clarifications were  incorporated 
directly into the protocol.  
Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. 
IRBs/ECs  
A copy of this amended protocol will be sent to the Institutional Review Board (IRBs )/Ethics 
Committee (ECs) and Health Authorities  as appropriate.  
The changes described in this amended protocol require IRB/IEC and Health Authority approval 
according to local regulations prior to implementation.  
The changes herein affect the Informed Consent.  Sites are required to update and submit for 
approval a revised Informed Consent that takes into account the changes described in this protocol amendment.

1 I ntroduction  
 Inclisiran (also referred to as KJX839) is  a novel synthetic ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference 
(RNAi) therapeutic  used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. This protocol describes a study 
to evaluate the effect of inclisiran  treatment on low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) levels . 
This study is sponsored by Novartis and will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical 
Practices (GCP) including the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
1.1 Background 
1.1.1 Disease Overview  
Despite advances in treatment, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death  
worldwide, resulting in over 17 million deaths annually ( WHO 2016) . Eighty percent of all  CVD 
deaths are due to coronary heart disease (CHD) or strokes. Elevated LDL -C is a major risk factor 
for the development of CVD ( Grundy et al, 2004; Go et al, 2014) . Lowering LDL -C has been 
shown to reduce the risk of death or heart attack and within the range of effects achieved so far, the clinical risk reduction is linearly proportional to the absolute LDL -C reduction ( Baigent et al 
2005). 
Approximately 100 million people worldwide are treated with lipid lowering therapies, 
predominantly statins, to reduce LDL -C and the associated risk of death nonfatal myocardial 
infarction (MI) and nonfat al stroke or associated events ( Decision Resources Group, 2015) . Yet 
residual risk for cardiovascular (CV) events remains and statins are associated with well -known 
limitations. First, not all patients reach LDL -C levels associated with optimal prot ection against 
clinical events ( Foley et al, 2003; Baigent et al 2005; Davidson et al, 2005; CTT Collaborators et 
al, 2008; Foody et al, 2010) . Second, not all patients tolerate statins or are able to take statins at 
sufficiently intensive doses. And third, observational studies have demonstrated that >50% of patients do not adhere to statin therapy for more than 6 months ( Poluzzi et al, 2008 ; Mann et al, 
2010). 
There  is an unmet need for additional treatment options beyond currently available treatments for 
lowering of the LDL- C level to reduce cardiovascular risk.  
Despite statins alone or in combination with other lipid lowering medications, current therapies 
for the management of elevated LDL -C remain insufficient in some patients ( Jones et al, 2012 ; 
Jameson et al, 2014; Barkas et al 2015; Fitzgerald et al, 2017 ). This is particularly true in patients 
with pre -existing CHD and/or diabetes or a history of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), who are 
at the highest risk and require  the most intensive management ( Davidson et al, 2005 ).  
Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a member of the serine protease family, plays a key role in controlling the levels of low -density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR)  on the 
surface of hepatocytes ( Khorova, 2017) . PCSK9 is expressed and secreted into the bloodstream 
predominantly by the liver, binds LDLR both intracellularly and extracellularly and promotes the lysosomal degradation of t hese receptors in hepatocytes, ( Lakoski et al, 2009; Mousavi et al, 2009 ) 
thereby increasing the circulating LDL- C levels. Loss of function mutations in PCSK9 have been 
found to lead to increased LDLR in liver, reduced serum L DL-C, and a lower risk for CHD (Berge 
et al, 2006; Cohen et al, 2006; Kotowski et al, 2006; Zhao et al, 2006) with no apparent  negative 
health consequences. ( Zhao et al, 2006; Hooper et al, 2007 ; Horton et al, 2009).

Recently developed and approved PCSK9- blocking monoclonal antibodies reduce circulating 
PCSK9 levels and lower LDL -C levels. Preliminary reports indicate that treatment with such 
antibodies can lead to reduction of cardiovascular events compared with placebo ( Hooper et al, 
2005; Navarese et al, 2015 ; Robinson et al, 2015; Zhang et al, 2015; Sabatine et al, 2017). Results 
from the first completed large CV outcomes trial (FOURIER) were reported in March 2017. 
Repatha® (evolocumab) significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events. The study in approximately 27,000 patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) met its primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization) and the key secondary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonf atal MI or nonfatal stroke) ( Sabatine et al, 2017 ).  
The data from PCSK9 blocking antibodies such as Repatha® (evolocumab) and Praluent® (arilocumab) are very encouraging. However, these products are dosed SC every 2 to 4 weeks necessitating up to 26 injections per year ( Hooper et al, 2005; Navarese et al, 2015 ; Zhang et al, 
2015) . In contrast, one injection of i nclisiran is anticipated to be given three times in the first year 
and every 6 months thereafter. 
1.1.2 PCSK9 Biology and Target Rationale 
PCSK9 is a member of the subtilisin serine protease family. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 
type 9 is predominantly expressed by the liver and is critical for the down regulation of hepatocyte 
LDLR expression ( Mousavi et al, 2009) . LDL -C levels in plasma are markedly elevated in humans 
with gain of function mutations in PCSK9, classifying them as having severe familial hypercholest erolemia (Abifadel et al, 2003) . Data from genetic association studies have identified 
loss of function alleles in human PCSK9 that result in lower PCSK9 protein  levels and lower LDL -
C levels ( Zhao et al, 2006; Hooper et al, 2007; Horton et al, 2009). In one published study, 
heterozygous individuals (carrying a single copy of a loss of function PCSK9 mutation) had significantly lower LDL -C with median levels of approx imately 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) ( Cohen 
et al, 2006). Over a 15- year period of retrospective data analysis, this sustained lowering in LDL -
C levels translated to an 88% lower risk of risk for CHD. Follow -up publications describe two 
adult individuals that are compound heterozygous for loss of function alleles of PCSK9. These individuals lack detectable plasma PCSK9 protein, have LDL -C levels ≤20  mg/dL, and yet are 
otherwise healthy ( Zhao et al, 2006 ; Hooper et al, 2007) . Additionally, recent human clinical trials 
with PCSK9 blocking antibodies have shown significant lowering of LDL -C in healthy volunteers 
and across a range of high CV -risk populations and with elevated LDL -C both with and without 
statins ( Banerjee et al, 2012; Dias et al, 2012; Milazzo et al, 2012; Raal et al, 2012 ; Roth et al, 
2012; Stein et al, 2012 ; Sullivan et al, 2012; Hooper et al, 2013). Two monoclonal agents to inhibit 
PCSK9 are currently approved in Europe and North America. Recent cardiovascular outcomes trials have further confirmed that PCSK9 is a validated drug target whose inhibition results in LDL -C lowering and significant outcomes benefit without otherwise negatively impacting overall 
health ( Ridker et al, 2017; Sabatine et al, 2017 ).  
1.1.3 Mechanism of RNA Interference 
Ribonucleic acid interference  (RNAi)  is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism for regulating 
gene expression that is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Typically, synthetic siRNAs are 19 -base to 25 -base pair double -stranded oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 
two- to four-nucleotide overhang at one or both of the 3’  ends. Such siRNAs can be designed to 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 14 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
target an endogenous messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript of a given gene. When introduced into 
cells, the guide (or antisense) strand of the siRNA loads into an enzyme complex called the RNA -
Induced Silencing Complex. This enzyme complex subsequently binds to its complementary mRNA sequence, mediating cleavage of the target mRNA and the suppression of the target protein encoded by the mRNA ( Elbashir et al, 2001).  
Since unmodified siRNAs are rapidly eliminated and do not achieve significant tissue distribution upon systemic adm inistration (Soutschek et al, 2004) , various formulations are currently used to 
target their distribution to tissues, and to facilitate uptake of siRNAs into the relevant cell type. One approach that has been used successfully in vivo, in animal models (including in rodents and nonhuman primates) and humans employs intravenous  (IV) delivery of siRNA in lipid 
nanoparticle formulations ( Soutschek et al, 2004; Morrissey et al, 2005; Geisbert et al, 2006; Judge 
et al, 2006; Zimmermann et al, 2006 ; Coelho et al, 2013; Tabernero et al, 2013) . Another approach 
for liver- specific gene silencing is subcutaneously administered siRNA conjugated to a 
N-acetylgalactosamin e (GalNAc) carbohydrate ligand ( Ashwell and Morell, 1974) . Conjugation 
of a triantennary GalNAc ligand to an siRNA enables hepatocyte binding and subsequent cellular uptake via the asialoglycoprotein receptor, resulting in engagement of the RNAi pathway and down regulation of hepatic proteins. Single and multiple doses of subcutaneously administered siRNA- GalNAc conjugates have been used to target transthyretin (TTR) mRNA for the treatment 
of TTR -mediated amyloidosis. ALN -TTRCSC has been found to be generally safe and well 
tolerated in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in over 40  healthy volunteers and 18 subjects with 
familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy a nd senile systemic amyloidosis ( ALN- TTRSC -001; 
EudraCT 2012-004203-12; and ALN- TTRSC -002; EudraCT 2013-002856-33).  
1.2 Inclisiran, an siRNA Therapeutic for Hypercholesterolemia  
Inclisiran sodium is a chemically synthesized siRNA double-stranded oligonucleotide, covalently linked to a ligand containing three GalNAc residues. 
Inclisiran is a long -acting, subcutaneously delivered, synthetic siRNA directed against PCSK9 that 
is conjugated to triantennary GalNAc carbohydrates. These carbohydrates bind to abundant liver-
expressed asialoglycoprotein receptor, leading to inclisiran uptake specifically into hepatocytes.  
When introduced into the hepatocyte, inclisiran engages the natural pathway of RNAi by binding intracellularly to the RNA -induced silencing complex (RISC), enabling it to cleave mRNA 
molecules encoding PCSK9 specifically. The cleaved PCSK9 mRNA is degraded  and thus 
unavailable for protein translation, which results in decreased levels of the PCSK9 protein. A single siRNA -bound RISC is catalytic and cleaves many transcripts and the duration of action is 
anticipated to be longer than other mechanisms. 
1.2.1 Nonclinical Studies  
Inclisiran was specifically designed with molecular and biochemical characteristics to minimize 
untoward side effects which are reflected by the absence of dose limiting toxicities in preclinical models. For example, GalNAc ligands were added to the RNA st rands in order to target inclisiran 
to receptors on hepatocytes, thereby greatly reducing uptake by heterologous tissue. This is highlighted by tissue distribution studies in rats showing that compared to liver, inclisiran exposure in other tissues was 36 -fold to 1076- fold lower than liver.

I
nclisiran was well tolerated in all studies. The most common findings were related to the expected 
pharmacological effects of inclisiran on lipid profiles and histopathological findings of vacuolation in hepatocytes of rats and lymph node macrophages of monkeys and the presence of basophilic granules in hepatocytes of monkeys and kidneys of rats. These microscopic findings are not considered adverse because they are not associated with changes in clinical pathology parameters. Liver function enzymes were o nly minimally to mildly increased, and were reversible following 
treatment-free periods, and there were no changes in urinalysis or urine chemistry parameters.  
Additional non-clinical studies are ongoing or planned. 
1.2.2 Clinical Studies 
1.2.2.1 Clinical pharmacology 
Inclisiran is inactive in plasma and acts directly in the hepatocytes leading to inhibition of PCSK9 
protein synthesis. After SC administration of inclisiran, peak plasma concentrations were observed by 4 hours and became undetectable in plasma in 24 hours to 48  hours with a n elimination terminal 
half- life (t
1/2) of 7.3 hours and dose -proportional increase in exposure parameters of maximum 
plasma concentration (C max) and area under the curve (AUC). There was no accumulation of 
inclisiran plasma concentrations following multiple weekly, biweekly or monthly dosing. Mean fraction excreted unchanged in the urine was around 25%. In vitro studies using hepatic P450 metabol ic enzymes showed that inclisiran neither inhibited nor induced common hepatic metabolic 
pathways.  
In a Phase I study in subjects with renal impairment (ORION-7, also referred  to as 
CKJX839A12103) ( Section 1.2.2.2.4), a single 300 mg SC dose of inclisiran sodium  which is 
equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran  was observed to increase C
max and AUC up to approximately two-
fold in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment, and increased C max up to four -fold and 
AUC up to three -fold in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal 
renal function. However, by 48 hours plasma levels of inclisiran were below the level of 
quantification in all groups.  
Despite the differences observed in pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters over the first 48 hours 
following injection of inclisiran, there were generally no relevant differences between the groups with respect to PCSK9 reduction and LDL -C reduction. In addition, there was no difference in the 
overall safety profile between subjects with normal renal function and those with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.  
This finding is consistent with that observed in the previous Phase I (ALN -PCSSC -001, also 
referred  to as 
CKJX839A12101. ) study ( Section 1.2.2.2.1) where doses above 300 mg, which is 

Novartis  Confidential  Page 16 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
equivalent to 284 mg inclisiran,  led to a dose related increase in PK parameters. A single 500 mg 
dose increased AUC two to three fold and Cmax four to five  fold compared to a single 300 mg 
dose, which is similar to the increase observed in subjects with severe renal impairment compared 
to those with normal renal function in this study. In both the Phase I (ALN -PCSSC -001) and Phase 
II (ORION -1 also referred to as CKJX839A12201) studies single doses above 300 mg did not lead 
to greater reductions in PCSK9 or LDL -C levels over time or differences in the safety profile.  
These data support the administration of inclisiran to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment in future and ongoing clinical studies with inclisiran.  
Additional clinical pharmacology studies are ongoing or planned. 
1.2.2.2 Clinical  
Results are presented from four clinical studies: 
1.2.2.2.1  Study ALN -PCSSC- 001 (also referred  to as CKJX839A12101)  
ALN- PCSSC -001 ( completed) was a Phase I study in which single (25 mg, 100 mg, 300 mg,  
500 mg and 800 mg) and multiple [125 mg once weekly (four doses), 250 mg every 2 weeks (two 
doses), 300 mg every 4 weeks (two doses) and 500 mg every four weeks (two doses) ] doses of 
inclisiran sodium were evaluated. Subjects in this study were followed until their LDL -C levels 
returned to ≥80% of the baseline value or until 180 days after the last dose was given, whichever 
occurred first. At cumulative doses of 100 mg or  greater, the majority of subjects reached 180  days 
of follow -up after the last dose, confirming the extended duration of action of inclisiran. No further 
follow -up occurred beyond this time point in this Phase I study. All adverse events (AEs) were 
mild o r moderate ( Grade 1 or 2) in severity with no differences relative to placebo other than skin 
reactions which were infrequent, mild and reversible following inclisiran.  
The Phase I study demonstrated that the 300 mg dose of inclisiran sodium administered as a single 
or multiple dose is the lowest dose to achieve near -maximal reductions in PCSK9 and LDL -C 
levels. Two 300 mg doses of inclisiran sodium given 30 days apart achieved an additional 10% 
LDL -C reduction compared to a single 300 mg dose. PK parameters of inclisiran demonstrated a 
short plasma half -life (t
1/2 = ~6 hours) and did not correlate with the observed pharmacodynamic 
(PD) effects of inclisiran.  
1.2.2.2.2  Study ORION -1 (MDCO- PCS- 15-01 also referred  to as CKJX839A12201  
ORION- 1 (MDCO- PCS-15-01, completed study) was a Phase II, double -blind, randomized, multi -
national, multi -center study in subjects with ASCVD or ASCVD -risk equivalents (eg, diabetes and 
FH) and elevated LDL -C despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL -C lowering therapies to 
evaluate t he efficacy, safety, and tolerability of inclisiran injection(s).  
A total of 501 subjects were randomized to a single dose regimen of placebo, 200 mg inclisiran sodium , or 300 mg inclisiran sodium , 500 mg inclisiran sodium (on Day 1) or a double -dose 
regimen of placebo, 100 mg inclisiran sodium , 200 mg inclisiran sodium , or 300 mg inclisiran  
sodium (on Day 1 and Day 90). 
The 300 mg dose provided near maximal PCSK9 and LDL-C reductions. The 500 mg dose did 
not provide a meaningful further increase in PD effect. The double-dose regimen of 300 mg 
regimen led to reduced LDL-C of 52.6% (LS mean) compared to a 1.8% increase in the placebo 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 17 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
group (p<0.0001) at Day 180. Similarly, this regimen led to reduced PCSK9 of 69.1% (mean) 
compared to a 1.2% decrease in the placebo group at Day 180. At Day 360 (9 months after the 
second 300 mg dose), LDL-C reduction was 33.8%.  
There were no clinically significant safety observations other than mild -moderate, short -lived skin 
reactions at the injection site in approximately 5% of subjects. Local injection site reactions were 
not dose- related.  
1.2.2.2.3  Study ORION -2 (MDCO- PCS- 16-02,  also referred  to as CKJX839A12202) 
ORION- 2 (MDCO -PCS-16-02 completed study ) was a Phase II, open label, single arm, 
multicenter pilot study in subjects with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  (HoFH) . Four 
s
ubjects were randomized and  recei ved open -label inclisiran  sodium 300 mg  SC on Day 1. The 
subsequent dosing interval was determined by PCSK9 level at Day 60 or 90 or rate of change of PCSK9 between Days 60 and 90.  In three subjects mean serum PCSK9 levels were not suppressed by >70% at Day 60 or 90, as compared to baseline and received a second injection  on Day 90. 
Incl
isiran treatment resulted in robust and durable reductions in PCSK9 levels in all four subjects 
treated at a dose of 300 mg SC. Three of the four subjects also had significantly reduced levels of LDL -C. One subject had a significant reduction in PCSK9 but not a concomitant reduction in LDL -
C. The mean percentage LDL -C reduction from baseline was 12.3% and 21.0% at Day 90 and Day 
180, respectively. The maximum reductions in LDL -C were at Day 120 for two subjects and at 
Day 150 for a third subject. Theref ore, the second dose achieved a greater reduction in LDL -C 
than after the first dose.  
The mean percentage PCSK9 reduction from baseline was 59.0% and 62.9% at Day 90 and Day 180, respectively. Decreases in other lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were commensurate with the decreases in LDL -C. 
No safety observations were noted and inclisiran  was generally well tolerated. Three of the four 
subjects reported adverse events. None were considered related to study drug and the majority have resolved. One adverse event of leg pain was not resolved at the most recent visit. There  were 
no deaths and one SAE (unstable angina, which was not considered related to study drug). No subjects withdrew due to an adverse event and no adverse events at the injection site were reported.  
Elevations in chemistry parameters were observed. One subject with an elevated total bilirubin 
(>1x ULN) at screening experienced a single elevation of total bilirubin >2x ULN on Day 120. There were no ALT or AST elevations >3 x ULN or CK elevations >5x ULN .  
 
The results from this pilot study support the 300mg dose and dose regimen for the ongoing Phase III ORION -5 study in HoFH. 
1.2.2.2.4  Study ORION -7 (MDCO -PCS- 16-03, also referred to as CKJX839A12103) 
ORION-7 (MDCO- PCS-16-03) ; completed study) wa s a Phase I, single-dose, open- label study to 
evaluate the PK, safety, and PD of a single dose of inclisiran sodium 300 mg, SC injection  in 
subjects with renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function . Subjects were 
classified into one of four renal function groups (normal, mild, moderate, and severe), as defined 

Novartis  Confidential  Page 18 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
by creatinine clearance ( CrCl) which was calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault estimation 
from a spot serum creatinine level (Table 1 -1). 
Table 1-1 Renal Function Categories by Estimated CrCl Ranges 
Group  Description  Estimated CrCl (mL/min)  
1 Normal renal function  ≥ 90  
2 Mild renal impairment  60 to 89  
3 Moderate renal impairment  30 to 59  
4 Severe renal impairment  15 to 29  
CrCl=creatinine clearance  
These subjects were matched for  age (+/ - 10 years), body weight (+/ - 20%), and proportional race 
and gender  in order to ensure that the normal renal function group  was comparable to the renal 
impairment groups for average demographics.  Thirty -one subjects were randomized into the study, 
eight subjects in each of the normal renal function and the mild and moderate renal impairment 
groups and seven in the severe renal impairment group. All subjects completed the study to Day 60. 
In individuals with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, inclisiran C
max was 2.33, 1.97 and 
3.31 fold higher , respectively; AUC 0-24 was 1.75, 1.91 and 2.50 fold higher , respectively; AUC 0-48 
was 1.58, 1.83 and 2.33 fold higher , respectively; AUC 0-t was 1.53, 1.73 and 2.35 fold higher , 
respectively; AUC 0-inf was 1.44, 1.39 and 2.23 fold higher , respectively, relative to subjects with 
normal renal function . However, inclisiran was not detectable in plasma 48  hours after 
administration of a single 300 mg dose in any group irrespective of renal impairment.  
At Day 60, LDL -C (beta -quantification) was reduced by 57.56%, 35.11%, 53.09%, and 49.20%, 
in the normal renal function group and the mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment groups 
respectively. Mean LDL -C reduction was less in the mild renal impairment group compared to the 
other three groups. Overall, LDL -C reduction was generally simil ar between groups with no 
impact of renal function on LDL- C response.  
A single injection of 300  mg inclisiran was generally well tolerated in all study groups with no 
clinically significant safety findings to date. T here was no difference in the overall safety profile 
between subjects with normal renal function and those with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment and therefore no dose adjustment of inclisiran is considered necessary in subjects with 
renal impairment. 
1.3 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits 
Subjects taking part in this clinical study will receive guideline recommended standard of care as background therapy (including maximally- tolerated statin therapy and/or other LDL -C lowering 
therapies) when administered inclisiran. Reduction of LDL -C has been associated with reduced 
CV risk both by epidemiology and in controlled clinical trials. Injection site reaction is the only event known to be attributed to inclisiran treatment. The safety profile of inclisiran observed to date is considered acceptabl e for this clinical trial.   
An expanded risk- benefit summary is provided in the current /approved version of the investigator 
brochure ( IB).

1.4 Study Rationale  
1.4.1 Study Rationale 
The overall safety data from inclisiran in nonclinical studies a nd clinical data from the Phase I and 
Phase II  study  (ORION -1 also referred  to as CKJX839A12201) , and multiple PCSK9 antibody 
studies demonstrated that potent lowering of PCSK9 is well tolerated in human subjects and 
support the dose and dosing schedule proposed in this Phase III  extension  study. This extension 
study allows subjects continued access to inclisiran treatment and to allow the collection of 
additional efficacy and safety beyond the end of the original studies. 
1.4.2 Dose Rationale 
Previous studies have shown that a 300 mg dose of inclisiran sodium  is well tolerated and provides 
maximum efficacy (ie, doses higher than 300 mg did not provide additional efficacy in LDL -C 
lowering). Subjects completing the Phase II trial MDCO -PCS-16-01 (ORION-3, also referred to 
as CKJX839A12201E1 ) or one of the P hase III lipid lowering studies [MDCO- PCS-17-03  
(ORION-9, also referred  to as CKJX839A12303), MDCO- PCS-17-04 ( ORION-10, also referred  
to as CKJX839A12304) or MDCO- PCS-17-08 (ORION-11, also referred  to as  
CKJX839A12305) ] and fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study will receive 
inclisiran sodium 300mg at the next time point  they are scheduled as per the previous study to 
receive inclisiran i.e. 180 days after the last injection in the previous study.  Modelling and 
simulation has demonstrated that this regimen will allow for the necessary robust and sustained 
reduction in PCS K9 (and LDL -C) and has the potential to tackle the lack of adherence generally 
seen in the chronic management of subjects with hypercholesterolemia.  The 300 mg dose of 
inclisiran sodium will be used for the entire duration of this study for subjects receiving inclisiran.  
1.5 Study Population  
This study will include male or female subjects who have c omplet ed a previous qualifying Phase 
II lipid lowering trial [MDCO -PCS-16- 01 (ORION- 3)]  or Phase III lipid -lowering ORION feeder 
study [MDCO -PCS-17-03 (ORION- 9), MDCO- PCS-17-04 (ORION-10) or MDCO -PCS-17-08 
(ORION-11),  ], and fulfill the study entry criteria .

3 Study  Design  
3.1 Type/Design of Study 
This study will be a long-term extension of the Phase II lipid lowering trial [MDCO- PCS-16-01 
(ORION-3) ] and Phase III lipid -lowering studies [MDCO- PCS-17-03 (ORION-9),  MDCO- PCS-
17-04 ( ORION-10) , or MDCO- PCS-17-08 (ORION-11) . Up to 3300 subjects with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) , ASCVD- risk equivalents (eg, diabetes and familial 
hypercholesterolemia), heterozygous  familial hypercholesterol emia ( HeFH  
) and elevated LDL -C despite  treatment with  LDL -C lowering therapies who are eligible 
and willing to participate may be enrolled.  The objectives of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of long -term dosing of inclisiran. Informed consent will be obtained from 
subjects bef ore the initiation of any study- specific procedures. The EOS visit in the previous feeder 
studies  will be Day 1 in  the extension  trial except for subjects enrolled in Sweden.   Sweden S pecific 
Protocol A mendment 1 ( to Global Amendment 1 version, dated 1 Nov 2018)  was implemented to 
allow limited lab tests to be done on Day 1 and to collect any safety information  during the gap 
between feeder’s EOS and Day1 of this study until ethics committe e approval was granted in that 
country.  S ubjects moving over from the open label ORION -3 study will not receive study 
medication at Day 1. Their first dose of study medication in this trial will be at day 90. This is to  
maintain their 6 months dosing schedule on inclisiran treatment. This  trial will be a global , 
multicenter study in approximately 300 centers.  
The duration that each  subject is expected to participate in this study is a maximum of 3 years or 
the occurrence of one of the following events , whichever occurs first : 
• a recommendation  of discontinuation by the investigator or Sponsor, 
• a decision by the subject to discontinue for any reason,

Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
5.1.1 Placebo  
The placebo pre -filled syringes will contain saline solution. Placebo pre -filled syringes will be 
blinded and look identical to the inclisiran pre -filled syringes. Placebo will be administered as a 
1.5 mL SC injection to match the dose of the inclisiran group. 
5.1.2 Packaging and Labeling  
Investigational product ( Inclisiran for Injection  and matching placebo ) will be provided by the 
sponsor. All pre -filled syringes, inclisiran or placebo, will look identical. Medication labels will 
comply with regulatory requirements. The storage conditions for each medication provided will 
be described on the medication label.  
The container closure system for the pre- filled  syringe consists of a Type I glass syringe with  a 
stainless steel 2 7G ½” staked needle covered by a removable rigid needle shield and Fluorotech 
coated bromobutyl plunger. 
All inclisiran and placebo investigational product used for the Day 1 dose will have a yellow 
shroud to maintain the blind.  
5.1.3 Storage  
Investigational product  (pre- filled  syringes) will be stored at controlled room temperature  (20°C 
to 25°C [68°F to 77°F] with allowable excursions between 15°C and 30°C [59°F to 86°F ]) as 
specified in the Pharmacy Manual. Access should be strictly limited to the investigator, 
pharmacists, and their designees. No special procedures are required for the safe handling of Inclisiran for Injection.  
5.1.4 Accountability  
The investigator or designee must maintain an inventory record of the investigational product 
(inclisiran/placebo ) received and all administered to assure the regulatory authorities and the 
Sponsor that the new investigational product will not be dispensed to any person who is not a subject under the terms and conditions set forth in this protocol. Investigational product 
accountability forms and/or specific instructions can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
The investigational product supplied for use in this study is to be prescribed only by the Principal 
Investigator or designated sub- investigators and may not be used for any purpose other than that 
outlined in this protocol. 
Since used syringes must be discarded  during the study, the box that the pre -filled syringes came 
in will be kept until the monitor has reviewed the accountability records.  
All unused investigational product will be destroyed on site (or returned to the packaging and 
labeling facility for destruction) once the investigational product has been inventoried and the monitor has reviewed the accountability records. In the event that investigational product needs to be returned for any other reason, the site will receive a written request listing the investigational product lot number(s) to be returned and the reason for the return request.

but no later than 24 hours from the time of awareness  All product and device deficiencies observed 
during the conduct of the trial and leading to a preference or Technical Quality Deficiency 
reporting must be recorded in the eCRF. 
 
Product deficienc y reporting  (complaints): Is defined as any written, electronic, or oral 
communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, durability, reliability, quality, safety, effectiveness or performance of a product, after it is released for distribution (European Union [ EU] DIR 2001/83/EC). (Derived from Ref US 21 Code of Federal Regulations [ CFR] 
211.198) and Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745). 
There  are two types of Product Deficiencies :  
Preference complaints : A report of dissatisfaction with service, delivery, packaging or other 
preference.  
Technical Quality Deficiency  reporting  (technical quality c omplaint s): A report of 
dissatisfaction with the product with regard to its efficacy, strength, integrity, purity, or quality; 
thus a potential failure to meet product specifications. Examples include:  
• An indication that there is an unexpected physical change in the drug product such as discoloration, change in shape of the drug product, presence of particulates or any other physical change that might indicate contamination, a manufacturing defect or any other event that might indicate a  compromise in product quality

6 S chedule and sequence of procedures 
The Schedule of Events/Assessments ( Table 6 -1) summarizes the study assessments by time point.  
This study will be a  long-term extension study for subjects considered “completers”  of the Phase 
II lipid lowering MDCO -PCS-16-01 (ORION- 3) or P hase III lipid lowering  ORION feeder studies  
[MDCO- PCS-17- 03 (ORION- 9), MDCO- PCS-17-04 ( ORION-10), or MDCO- PCS-17-08 
(ORION-11) ]. A “completer” of the previous study is defined as having received the final protocol 
dose of study drug and completing the final study visit/ and being considered a successful 
completion during the EOS visit . The EOS visit in the previous feeder study will be Day 1 in 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 28 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
ORION-8 trial except for subjects enrolled in Sweden (Section 3.1 and Section 6.3). The expected 
duration of the subjects’ involvement in the study will be a maximum of 3 years.  
On Day 1 (EOS visit in the feeder study), subjects will receive blinded study medication  except 
for subjects moving over from ORION -3. These subjects will receive the first study medication at 
day 90. Subjects who received placebo in the previous  Phase III  feeder study will receive blinded  
inclisiran  and subjects who received inclisiran in the previous feeder study will receive blinded 
placebo at this visit, in order to maintain the blinding of the feeder study until database lock of 
those studies.   
On Day 90, all s ubjects will receive inclisiran sodium  300 mg which is equivalent to 284 inclisiran . 
This is 180 days after the last injection in the previous feeder study for subjects  that received  
inclisiran and will be the second dose of inclisiran for the subjects that received placebo in the 
feeder study.  
The three study periods are:  
• Study Entry (Day 1):   
• The EOS visit procedures from the previous ORION feeder study will be used as the 
Day 1 data for this study except for subjects enrolled in Sweden (Section  3.1 and Section 
6.3). In addition, consent and eligibility assessment for this study will be completed.  
• Treatment Phases :   
• Double Blind: Day 1 (blinded inclisiran or blinded placebo) to Day 90 
• Open Label: Day 90 (open label inclisiran for all subjects ) and subsequent dosing visits 
with inclisiran every 180 days 
• End of Study (EOS): 
• The EOS visit will occur at Day 1080 or  90 days following the last Inclisiran for 
Injection  dose once one of the following criteria are met:  
• the investigator's rec ommendation of discontinuation 
• sponsor's recommendation of discontinuation 
• an administrative decisi on is made to end the study 
• NOTE:  For subjects prematurely and permanently discontinued from study treatment, who are not willing to return within the 90 day timeframe, the EOS visit will be scheduled as soon as possible , or if decision to discontinue and not return is made at a 
specific visit, this visit will become the EOS visit and EOS visit procedures should be followed . 
6.1 Schedule of Events/Assessments  
The schedule of assessments is provided in  Table 6 -1. 
If the COVID -19 pandemic limits or prevents on -site study visits, alternative methods of providing 
continuing care may be implemented. Phone calls or remote/ virtual contacts (e.g. teleconsult) can 
replace on -site study visits, for the duration of the pandemic until it is safe for the participant to 
visit the site again.   Also, the visits window has been extended to + /-2 months  during the pandemic.

1.  EOS visit should occur at least 90 days following the last inclisiran dose once a decision is made to end the study (either by the subject, investigator or 
sponsor). For subjects prematurely and permanently discontinued from study treatment, who are not willing to return within the 90 day timeframe, the EOS visit will 
be scheduled as soon as possible, or if decision to discontinue and not return is made at a specific visit, this visit will become the EOS visit and EOS visit 
procedures should be followed. 
2.  Day 1 visit is the same as EOS visit in the previous qualifying ORION study. Aside from informed consent and eligibility,  procedures will not be repeated but will 
be those captured during feeder study EOS visit  except for subjects enrolled in Sweden.   See Section 3.1.and Section 6.3 Sweden Specific Protocol Amendment 
1 (to Global Amendment 1 version), dated 1 Nov 2018.  
3.  Dosing visits will occur every 180 days until the study ends for each respective subject.  Visit windows have been extended to +/ -2 months  due to COVID -19.    

Novartis  Confidential  Page 30 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-05 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
 4.  Vital signs: blood pressure and heart rate will be measured prior to injection on dosing days.  When available, an automated BP device is recommended for 
collection of BP and the result recorded to the nearest mmHg. The subject should be sitting at rest for at least 5 minutes prior to these assessments. One 
assessment for each vital sign (HR, BP) is required per applicable visit.  
5.  See Section 7.1.6.3 for details of specific tests to be analyzed  
6.  See Section 7.1.6.1 and Section 7.1.6.2  for details of specific tests to be analyzed  
7.  Urinalysis collection is prior to the injection; supplies from the central laboratory must be used to perform the urinaly sis 
8.  Only in women of childbearing potential (performed locally, prior to any dosing, using central laboratory kit supplies and with results prior to injection; urine 
pregnancy test) . Results of the pregnancy test from Day 540 of the feeder study will be used on Day 1 in ORION -8  
  
10.  Subjects who received blinded placebo in the feeder study will receive blinded inclisiran and subjects who received blinded inclisiran in the feeder study will 
receive blinded placebo on Day 1 in ORION -8. Subjects moving over from the ORION -3 trial will not receive any treatment at Day 1; all subjects were on inclisiran 
in the feeder trial and will receive their first dose of inclisiran in this study at day 90  
11. Subjects will be observed in the clinic for 30 minutes post injection in order to have additional vital and/or laboratory assessments completed if needed. For any 
suspected episode of anaphylaxis, the investigator will need to collect a blood sample for tryptase within 30 minutes of an onset of anaphylaxis (or as soon as 
logically possible).  
12.  Concomitant medications (relevant) and AE/SAE collection for this study will begin at time of consent and continue through EOS. Ongoing concomitant 
medications and AEs/SAEs from the feeder study will continue to be followed in this study until resolution.

 6.2 General Conduct of the Study  
Discussion about participation and consent for the ORION -8 study should occur after conduct of 
the ORION feeder study EOS procedures and include discussion that the EOS visit data in the 
previous study will be  considered for  Day 1 in this trial.  Written informed consent will be obtained 
for this study by the principal investigator or designee from all subjects before the performance of 
any protocol- specific procedure.  
Please see the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 6 -1) for a detailed schedule and Section 7 for details 
of all tests required in each panel.  
6.3 Study Entry/Double- blind Treatment phase (Day 1)  
The following procedures  and laboratory assessments are conducted as part of the EOS visit from 
the feeder study and are not repeated  for Day 1 of this trial. T he same values/samples data will be 
used for  Day 1 assessments in  ORION- 8  were applicable except for subjects enrolled in Sweden.  
Sweden Specific Protocol Amendment 1 (to Global Amendment 1  version, dated 1 Nov 2018) was 
implemented to allow limited lab tests to be done on Day 1 and to collect any safety information 
during the gap between feeder’s  EOS and Day1of this study  until ethics  committee  approval was 
granted in that country 
• Physical examination  
• Vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate)  
• Central clinical laboratory (full serum chemistry, hematology and coagulation) ( Section 
7.1.6) 
• Urinalysis (performed locally, using central laboratory supplies) ( Section 7.1.6.4) 
• Pregnancy test (performed locally, using central laboratory supplies) (women of childbearing 
potential only) (results of test must be reviewed prior to dosing) 
• Fasting lipid and lipoprotein profile (Section 7.2 ) 
  
• Concomitant medication  assessment  (relevant ongoing concomitant med ication s from feeder 
study are reported at this visit)  
• AE/SAE reporting  (ongoing AEs/SAEs from feeder study are reported at this visit) 
The following ORION-8 specific procedures will be performed on Day 1: 
• Informed consent for the ORION -8 study 
• Assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Administration of double- blinded placebo or inclisiran  treatment (except for subjects moving 
over from ORION -3)

 • Fasting lipid, lipoprotein  profile  and PCSK9  (Section 7.2) 
6.4 Open -label inclisiran Treatment Phase [ Day 90  and Subsequent 
dosing visits]  
Prior to the start of dosing of Inclisiran for Injection on Day 90, c entral lab oratory  blood results 
from Day 1 must be reviewed . If these results suggest any contraindication to treatment with 
Inclisiran for Injection, dosing should be delayed until repeat results at an interval agreed upon by 
the investigator and medical monitor have been conducted and returned to levels that deem dosing 
acceptable per investigator and medical monitor judgement  (Section 4.2 and Section 4.3). The 
following procedures will be performed on Day 90 and every 180 days  thereafter  (see schedule of 
assessments) : 
• Vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate)  
• Central clinical laboratory (limited serum chemistry) (Section 7.1.6.3) 
• Pregnancy test (performed locally, using central laboratory supplies  with results prior to 
dosing) (women of childbearing potential only)  
• Fasting lipid and lipoprotein profile ( Section 7.2 ) 
  
• Open -label i nclisiran administration  (all subjects) 
• Relevant concomitant medications  assessment  
• AE/SAE reporting  
Subjects must be observed in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after injection.  
Should a subject develop signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis when investigational product is 
injected, the investigator will need to collect a blood sample for tryptase within 30  minutes of the

8 A dverse Events 
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject 
administered a medicinal product that does not necessarily have a causal r elationship with this 
treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life - threatening, ie, the subject was, in the opinion of the investigator, at immediate  risk of 
death from the event as it occurred (it does not include an event that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death)  
• Results in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in t
he subject's body function/structure, physical ac tivities and/or quality of life  
• Requires in -subject hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization 
• Is a con genital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is another medically significant event where medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical e vents that might not be immediately life threatening or result in  death or 
hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm , blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse. Any suspected 

Novartis  Confidential  Page 36 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
 transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious 
adverse reaction  
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. Severity is an estimate or measure of the intensity of an AE, while the criteria for serious AEs are indications of adverse subject outcomes for regulatory reporting purposes. A severe AE need not necessarily be considered serious and a serious AE need not be considered severe. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE. On the other hand, a MI  that may 
be considered minor could be an SAE if it prolonged hospitalization. 
8.1.3 Special Situations – Adverse Events 
There are situations when information is not necessarily considered an adverse event but can 
possibly contribute to the overall knowledge concerning the safety of the investigational product.  
Examples include, but are not limited to, reports of  pregnancy/lactation exposures with or without 
any AEs related to the parent or child ; medication errors – actual and potential ; accidental 
exposure ; suspected transmission via an investigational product  of an infectious agent; drug 
interaction.  
8.2 Collection and Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.2.1 A dverse Event Severity  
The severity of AEs will be assessed by the investigator using the 3-point scale below: 1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity 2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
8.2.2 Relationship to Investigational Product  
The relationship between the AE and the investigational product will  be assessed by using a 
binary assessment. The i nvestigator should determine whether there is a ‘Reasonable possibility’ 
or ‘No reasonable possibility’ that the investigational product caused the event  based on the 
definitions below . 
Reasonable possibility  
 - There is a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
investigational product  caused the AE. There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the investigational product and the AE No reasonable possibility  - The
 re is no reasonable possibility that the administration of the  
investigational product  caused the AE. There is no temporal relationship between the 
investigational product and event onset, or an alternative etiology has been established  
8.3 Requirements For Additional Safety Data Collection  
8.3.1 Special Situations – Additional Safety Data Collection 
Special Situations designated for this study include:  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 37 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
 • Medication errors that fall into the following categories  
o wrong investigational product 
o wrong dose (including overdose, underdose, change in dosing regimen, strength, form 
concentration, amount) 
o wrong route of administration 
o wrong subject (ie, not administered to the intended subject) 
o accidental exposure  
• Pregnancy/lactation exposures with or without any AEs related to the parent or child  
• Suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent  
• Drug interactions  
8.3.2 Other safety related information 
Injection site reactions (ISR) including individual signs or symptoms at the injection site following 
investigational product administration should be recorded on specifically designed eCRF pages. 
Other safety related information that should be reported as adverse events in accordance with the process described in section 8.4 are: 
• Potential anaphylactic reactions assessed by Sampson criteria (APPENDIX A). If Sampson 
criteria are positive, confirm by elevation of tryptase in blood plasma measured within 30 minutes of symptoms   
• Hyperglycemia- related AEs:  
Report ‘New onset of diabetes’ in subjects with no medical history of diabetes when: 
o HbA1C becomes ≥6.5% and/or  
o If a new concomitant medication for control of plasma glucose is added, further 
information to assess for a diagnosis of new onset diabetes will be collected  
Report ‘Worsening of the glycemic control’ or ‘diabetic complications’ in subjects with a medical 
history of disease (HbA1C ≥6.5% at baseline) when:  
o HbA1C increases from baseline > 0.5% and/or  
o New concomitant medication or increase in dose of current antidiabetic therapy is initiated to improve the control of plasma glucose level 
8.4 Procedure for Adverse Event Reporting  
8.4.1 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
All SAEs that occur from consent (Day1) through EOS must be reported to Novartis safety  within 
24 hours of awareness of the event using the provided study specific SAE Report Form. E ach SAE 
must also be recorded on the source documents and on the appropriate page of the e CRF .  
The investigator should provide any follow -up information for the event to the Sponsor on an 
updated SAE Report Form  as soon as it becomes available. The Sponsor will contact the 
investigator , if necessary, to clarify  any of the event information or request additional information. 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 38 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
 If the investigator is notified of a SAE  that occurs post -study period, that he or she wishes to  report 
to the Sponsor (eg, an event suspected to be causally related to investigational product), the event 
should be reported through the process described above.  
Where appropriate, if required by local regulations or procedures, the i nvestigator  should report 
these events to the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and/or national 
regulatory authority in addition to the Sponsor.  Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements are to be found in the 
investigator folder provided to each site. 
8.4.2 Non-Serious AEs  
All non- serious AEs that occur from consent through EOS must be assessed and recorded on the 
source documents and eCRF, regardless of causal relationship to the investigational product.  8.4.3 Special situations – Adverse Event Reporting  
8.4.3.1 Medication Errors 
All AEs (serious and non- serious) that occur in association with medication errors should be 
recorded in the AE page eCRF. Serious AEs should also be reported to Novartis safety    as 
described in section 8.4.1. No record of Medication Error itself should be included on the AE 
eCRF page . 
8.4.3.2 Pregnancy/Lactation Exposure  
Occurrences of pregnancy/lactation exposure  in a study subject from Day 1 through EOS must be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours using the Pregnancy/Lactation  Exposure Report Form.  
In cases where a pregnancy /lactation exposure  occurs with a SAE, the SAE Report  Form should 
be used to report the SAE  and the Pregnancy/Lactation Exposure  Report F orm should be used to 
report the pregnancy/lactation exposure.  
When a pregnancy/lactation exposure  occurs without any concurrent SAE, the 
Pregnancy/Lactation Exposure Report F orm must be submitted alone.  
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  Newborns should be followed for 12 
months. 
8.5 Expectedness 
8.5.1 Expectedness Determination  
Novartis safety d epartment will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected for the purpose of suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR) reporting. 
An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the safety information previously described for the investigational product in the current/approved version of the Investigator ’s Brochure. 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 39 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
 8.6 Study Stopping Criteria  
8.6.1 Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) Stopping Rules 
The IDMC will use all available evidence and their  collective judgment in making a 
recommendation to stop or modify the ORION -8 study for safety. Any statistical considerations 
are not a substitute for the committee’s medical, scientific, or statistical expertise.  Details will be 
provided in the respective charter(s).  
8.6.2 Sponsor Discontinuation Stopping Criteria 
The Sponsor will review data on an ongoing basis and may, on discussion with the  IDMC terminate 
the study for any clinically significant drug related safety signal (eg , serious hypersensitivity 
reactions or drug induced liver injury, etc). 
Premature termination of a study may also occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change 
in opinion of the IRB/EC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of the Sponsor . In addition, 
the Sponsor retains the right to discontinue development of inclisiran at any time.  
If a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued,  the Sponsor  will promptly notify the 
investigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within 30 days of the notification. Final study visits should occur within 30 days of subject contact. As directed by the Sponsor , all study materials must be collected 
and all e CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.  
The Sponsor, or designee, will inform the health authorities and the IRBs/EC that the study has 
been stopped and the reasons for doing so, within the locally applicable timelines. 
9 Data C ollection  
An electronic data capture (EDC) system which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant will be used for this study. Certain data points from the previous protocol participation ( ORION-3, ORION- 9, ORION-
10, or ORION-11) may be imported  to the EDC system for this study. All users will be trained on 
the technical features of the EDC as well as the content of the eCRF  by qualified personnel prior 
to gaining access to the EDC . A UserID/Password will be granted after training . This User ID is 
not to be shared amongst the study staff . All users must have a unique account to enter or review 
data. The eCRF should be filled out by the site 3 days after each  visit. It is not expected that the 
eCRF will serve as source for any data collected in this study. If there is a reason for a site to do 
so, it must be approved by Sponsor and documented in the site files. 
Prior to the database being locked, the investigator or designee will review, approve and sign/date 
each completed eCRF . This signature serves as attestation of the investigator ’s responsibility for 
ensuring that all data entered into the eCRF are complete, accurate and authentic . After the end of 
the study, a copy of the data will be provided to the site . This copy will contain the final data, an 
audit trail of activity on the data, and any queries and answers that were  posted for data 
clarification. For this study, the end of the study will be defined as the last visit of the last subject.

equivalents (eg, diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) , HeFH,  and elevated LDL -
C despite maximum tolerated dose of LDL -C lowering therapies who have completed one of the 
Phase III lipid lowering studies [ MDCO- PCS-17-03(ORION- 9), MDCO- PCS-17-04 ( ORION-
10),  MDCO -PCS-17-08 (ORION-11), or Phase II ORION- 3 trial ( MDCO- PCS-16-01) ] and fulfill 
the entry criteria for this study in order to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of long -
term dosing of inclisiran. Following completion of study procedure for the final visit in the feeder 
study, informed consent will be obtained from subjects before the initiation of any study- specific 
procedures. The EOS visit in the previous study will be Day 1 in ORION -8. This will be a global , 
multicenter study in approximately 300 centers.  
The duration that a subject is expected to participate in this study is a maximum of 3 years or the 
occurrence of one of the following events, whichever occurs first : 
• a recommendation of discontinuation  by the investigator or Sponsor, 
• a decision by the subject to discontinue for any reason, 
• an administrative decision is made to end the study  
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) document will provide more detailed specifications in 
data analysis and presentation.  
10.1 Sample Size  
Up to 3300 subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who have completed one of the 
Phase III lipid-lowering feeder studies [ MDCO -PCS-17-03  (ORION- 9), MDCO- PCS-17-04 
(ORION-10),  MDCO- PCS-17-08 (ORION-11) or Phase II ORION -3 trial (MDCO- PCS-16-01) ] 
and fulfill the entry criteria for this stud y will participate in this study.  
10.2 General Statistical Considerations and Definitions  
10.2.1 General Statistical Methods  
All study -collected data will be summarized using descriptive statistics, graphs, and/or raw data 
listings. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles (Q1 and Q3), m inimum (min) and maximum (max) 
values. Analysis of categorical variables will include frequency and percentage.  
10.2.2 Analysis Population - S afety population 
The safety population will be used for data analyses and/or presentation.  
All subjects who received at least one dose of study drug  will comprise the safety population . 
Treatment classification will be based on the actual treatment received. This will be the primary 
population for the efficacy and safety analyses.  
10.2.3 Analysis Windows 
The observational period for the study includes  Day 1 (EOS visit in the previous study), the 
Treatment phase which consists of the first dose (Day 1), Day 90 dose, and subsequent dosing 

Novartis  Confidential  Page 41 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
 visits every 180 days  until Day 990 and EOS  (Day 1080)  visit.  Any event occurring beyond the 
defined observational period, even if collected in the e- CRF, will not be included in the planned 
statistical analysis.  However, all data, including that reported after the defined observational 
period, will be included in the subject data listings.   
10.2.4 Missing Data Handling 
Unless otherwise specified, missing data will not be imputed and will be excluded from the 
associated analysis.  
10.3 Statistical Analyses  
10.3.1 Demographic and Background Characteristics 
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics except age collected from prior corresponding 
Phase III studies for each subject will be used for the summary using the safety population. For 
subjects moved over from the Phase II ORION -3 study, subject demographics and baseline 
characteristics collected at the ORION -3 study baseline will be used for this summary.  Age will 
be recalculated by adding the duration that each subject spent in the prior  corresponding Phase II 
or  Phase III study  
10.3.2 Study Drug and Concomitant Medications 
Summary of each prior (prebaseline in the previous  corresponding Phase II or  Phase III study ) 
medication and concomitant medication will be provided. Medication will be coded with World Health Organization  (WHO)  drug dictionary. Subjects will be counted only once within each 
period by medication.  
10.3.3 Efficacy Analysis  
10.3.3.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary efficacy analysis of this study is to assess the proportion of subjects who attain global 
lipid targets for their level of ASCVD at EOS . Confidence interval w ill be provided. 
10.3.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The actual value,  absolute and percentage change in LDL -C and other lipids parameters from 
baseline (defined as baseline  in the corresponding Phase II  or Phase III feeder study)  to EOS will 
be summarized  over time . Descriptive statistics will be provided.  
10.3.4 Safety Analysis 
The safety objectives  of this study are to evaluate t he safety and tolerability profile of inclisiran.  
The safety analysis will be descriptive.  
10.3.4.1 Adverse Events  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) dictionar y will be used for coding 
AEs. An AE (classified by preferred term) occurring during the study drug treatment period will 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 42 of 51 
Amended Protocol Version 02 (Clean ) Protocol No. MDCO -PCS-17-02 (CKJX839A12306B)  
 
 be counted as a treatment emergent AE (TEAE) either if it is not present at Day 1 of this study or 
if it is present at Day 1 of this study  but increased in severity during the treatment period. 
The number (percentage) of subjects reporting TEAEs for each preferred term will be tabulated by system -organ class, by system -organ class and severity, and by system -organ class and relationship 
to study drug.  If more than one event occurred with the sam e preferred term for the same subject, 
the subject will be counted only once for that preferred term using the most severe or related occurrence for the summary by severity, or relationship to study drug, respectively. 
10.3.4.2 Laboratory Tests  
Laboratory  values will be summarized at each time point. Analyses will also be performed for each 
lab parameter for incidence rates of potentially clinical significant (PCS) values for subjects 
without PCS value at baseline ( defined as baseline  in the corresponding Phase II or Phase III  feeder 
study), as well as without PCS value at Day 1 of the study 
10.3.4.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be summarized descriptively at each scheduled time point.  
10.4 I nterim Analysis  
No formal interim analysis will be performed in this study.  
10.4.1 Interim Safety Reviews  
The IDMC will review safety data on a regular schedule as specified in the IDMC charter from 
first subject enrollment in the double -blind phase  until the end of the open label phase of the study. 
A recommendation may be taken to stop or amend the study at any of these reviews. 
11 Records Retention

accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice.  The documents can be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the Sponsor.  
To comply with these requirements, the investigator will not dispose of any records relevant to 
this study without either (1) written permission from the Sponsor or (2) providing an opportunity 
for the Sponsor to collect such records.  The investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining 
adequate and accurate hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated during this study, including the hard copy or discs of the final data received from the Sponsor .  Such 
documentation is subject to inspection by the Sponsor or its agents, the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies. 
12 Qu ality Control and Quality A ssurance  
12.1 Monitoring  
The Sponsor has ethical, legal  and scientific obligations to carefully follow this study in 
accordance with established research principl es and applicable regulations. The investigator , as 
part of his /her responsibilities, is expected to cooperate with the Sponsor in ensuring that the study 
adheres to the protocol and GCP requirements.   
As part of a concerted effort to fulfill these obligations, the Sponsor's monitor will visit the 
center(s) during the study in accordance with the Monitoring Plan set forth for this study. The 
investigator will permit the Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as is deemed necessary and 
provide access to medical records/source documents to ensure that data are being recorded adequately, that data are verifiable and that protocol adherence is satisfactor y.   
12.2 Auditing  
The Sponsor may conduct audits at the study center(s). Audits will include, but not be limited to, study drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent process, and comparison 
of eCRFs with source documents. The investigator agrees to permit audits conducted at a 
reasonable time in a reasonable manner.  
Regulatory authorities worldwide may also inspect the investigator during or after the study.  The investigator should contact the Sponsor immediately if this occurs, and must permit regulatory 
authority inspections. 
12.3 Protocol Deviations  
Deviations from the protocol identified during the conduct of the trial have to be recorded in the e-CRF  and will be reviewed periodically:
 
• Informed Consent not signed prior to study entry in this study 
• Inclusion criteria violation

procedures (including any pre -treatment procedures) are performed.  The investigator (s) has both 
ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject (and their guardian or legally authorized representative) being considered for inclusion in this study is given a full explanation of the protocol. This shall  be documented on a written informed consent form  (ICF) , which shall be 
approved by the same IRB or EC responsible  for approval of this protocol.  Each ICF shall include 
the elements required by ICH, Part E6, Section 4.8 and any applicable local regulations. The 
investigator agrees to obtain approval from the Sponsor, or designee,  of any written ICF used in 
the study, preferably prior to submission to the IRB or EC.  
Once the appropriate essential information has been provided to the subject and fully explained by 
the investigator s (or a qualified designee) and it is felt that the subject understands the implications 
of participating, the subject and the investigator (or designee) shall sign the IRB - or EC -approved 
written ICF. The subject shall be given a copy of the signed ICF , and the original shall be filed 
appropriately, according to the institution. A second copy may  be filed in the subject's medical 
record, if allowed by the institution. 
13.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Ethics Committee (EC) 
This protocol, the written ICF  and any materials presented to subjects shall be submitted to the 
IRB or EC identi fied with this responsibility. Notification in writing of approval must come from 
the IRB or EC chairman or secretary, to the i nvestigator , either as a letter or as a copy of the 
appropriate section of the IRB or EC meeting minutes where this protocol and associated ICF  were 
discussed. The investigator will not participate in the decision.  If the investigator is an IRB or EC 
member, the written a pproval must indicate such nonparticipation in the voting session. The 
investigator will submit status reports to the IRB or EC as required by the governing body. The 
IRB or EC must be notified by the investigator in writing of the interruption and/or completion of 
the study; the investigator must promptly report to the IRB or EC all changes in research (protocol 
amendments) and will not make such changes without IRB or EC approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects.  In cases where it is necessar y to eliminate immediate hazards to subjects, the IRB or EC must then be notified of the 
change as per local requirements. The investigator is required to maintain an accurate and complete 
record of all written correspondence to and received from the IRB or EC and must agree to share all such documents and reports with the Sponsor.

 Appendix A : Sampson Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:  
• Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:  
a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expiratory flow [PEF], hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, 
hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
2. T wo or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely  allergen for that 
patient  (minutes to several hours):  
a. I nvolvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -
tongue-uvula) 
b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze, bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia 
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, painful abdominal cramps, vomiting)  
3. R
educed blood pressure after exposure to a known allergen for that patient  (minutes to 
several hours):  
a. I nfants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or >30% decrease in 
systolic blood pressure* 
b. Adults: systolic blood pressure <90 millimeters of mercury  (mmHg) or >30% decrease 
from that person’s Day 1 reading 
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is age specific and defined as: <70 mmHg for age 1 
month to 1 year; <70 mmHg + [2 x age] for age 1 to years; <90 mmHg for age 11 to 17 years.

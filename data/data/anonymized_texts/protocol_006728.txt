V4.19.19  Hypotheses  
Hypothesis 1:  Participants  receiving N-acetylcysteine (NAC) , as compared to placebo,  will demonstrate 
significantly greater reduction in SUD severity and craving from baseline to end of treatment (week 8).  
Hypothesis 2:  Participants  receiving N-acetylcysteine (NAC) , as compared to placebo, will demonstrate 
significantly greater reduction in PTSD  severity from baseline to end of treatment (week 8).  
Hypothesis 3:    Prefrontal cortex -amygdala connectivity at rest and in response to cues will predict reduction in 
SUD and PTSD severity.  
 
METHODS  
Overview:  A randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial among individuals  (N=90) with SUD and 
PTSD will be conducted to test the hypothesis that N -acetylcysteine (NAC) will significantly reduce SUD severity , 
craving , and PTSD symptom s. A subset  of enrolled subjects  between the ages of 21- 40 will complete 
neuroimaging procedure s before and after treatment. All procedures will be reviewed by the MUSC IRB  and the 
Ralph H. Johnson VA Research and Development committee prior to study start.  
 
Participants : Ninety  male and female participants  between the ages of 18 to 75 with current AUD/ SUD and 
comorbid PTSD or sub- threshold PTSD will be recruited to participate in the study.  
 
Recruitment : Primary r ecruitment sites include (1) the  Ralph H. Johnson VAMC  outpatient  Substance 
Treatment and Recovery Clinic (ST AR) and (2) the  PTSD Clinical Team (PCT ).  
 
Inclusion/ Exclusion C riteria : To be included,  subjects must (1) be 18-75 years old,  (2) meet DSM -5 criteria for 
current PTSD  or subthreshold PTSD , and ( 3) meet DSM -5 criteria for current AUD /SUD.  Exclusion criteria 
include: (1) s chizophrenia, bipolar disorder or an eating disorder;  (2) any significant medical illness (e.g., asthma) 
that may adversely affect safety or study participation; (3) psychotropic medication initiation  within  4 weeks of 
study participation or use of the fol lowing medications: carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, methotrexate, 
6-azauridine triacetate, nitroglycerin or any other medication that may have an adverse interaction with NAC; (4) 
pregnant or nursing women; and (5) clinically significant suicidal ideation and intent.  
 
General Procedures:  Interested individuals will be screened for eligibility . Individuals who meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be invited to come into the office for a comprehensive baseline assessment.  
Potential participants wi ll be given a full description of the study and asked to read and sign an IRB -approved 
informed consent form before any study procedures or assessments are conducted. Baseline assessment will 
include diagnostic interviews, history and physical examination,  assessment of concomitant medications, self -
report questionnaires, breathalyzer and urine drug screen (UD S), and pregnancy test for females . Ineligible 
participants will be referred clinically for treatment.  Immediately following the baseline visit,  eligible participants 
between the ages of 21 -40 will complete a neuroimaging session (described in the Neuroimaging Component 
section) prior to medication initiation. This same subset of participants will complete a second neuroimaging scan 
during week 8 prior to medication discontinuation. All participants will enter an  8-week, randomized, double-
blind, placebo- controlled trial in which they will be seen once weekly . 
 
Study Medication, Dosage, and Administration: The starting and continuation dose of NAC will be 1200mg 
bid (2400mg/day). Medication will be dispensed weekly and participants will be asked to return the prior week’s 
medication container in order to account for unused medication and to assess medication compliance. Equivalent number  of matching placebo capsules will be dispensed.  Study medications (USP -grade NAC and matched 
placebo capsules) will be packaged by Pitt Street Pharmacy in Mount Pleasant, SC and dispensed to participants by the medical clinician. All NAC and placebo capsules will also contain riboflavin 25 mg, which will be used as 
a biomarker for medication compliance. Participants who wish to take a multivitamin during the treatment phase 
of the study will be given a multivitamin that does not contain riboflavin. Treatment assignment will follow a pre-

V4.19.19  arranged randomization scheme and be carried out by a pharmacist not involved in clinical management of 
participants (to preserve the double -blind design).  Subjects will be maintained at the target dose for 8 weeks . 
Side eff ects and adverse events will be evaluated weekly.  
Cognitive B ehavioral Intervention:  Participants will receive 1- hour each week  of manual -based, cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) for AUD/ SUD.  Receipt of weekly CBT during the treatment phase will facilitate r etention 
and medication adherence, ensure that all participants receive adequate psychosocial suppor t regardless of 
medication arm , and enhance statistical power (Carroll  et al., 2004).  Sessions from the Cognitive Behavioral 
Coping Skills Manual ( Kadden et al., 2003 ) will be used, for example: Coping with Cravings and Urges to Use , 
Managing Thoughts about Alcohol /Drug Use, Problem Solving, Alcohol/ Drug  Refusal Skills, Planning for 
Emergencies and Coping with a Lapse,  and Managing Negative M oods and Depression.  All Study Therapists 
will complete a formal training  of the intervention. To help maintain treatment integrity, we will use a manualized 
treatment, provide intensive bi -weekly supervision to reinforce and sustain clinicians’ skills in therapy delivery, 
and monit or fidelity to the treatment manual using methods developed in the NIMH Collaborative Study  to prevent 
therapist “drift”  (DeRubeis et al., 1982) . 
 
Assessment Instruments: After the informed consent procedure, subjects will complete a battery of 
assessmen ts. The instruments to be used were selected because many are standardized, have good 
psychometric properties, are widely used and have been used by our research group.  The primary clinical 
outcomes include:   alcohol /substance  use severity (TLFB) , craving ( OCDS) , and PTSD symptom severity 
(CAPS- 5).  
 General Diagnostic and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Alcohol/Substance Use Disorder and Craving  
• Timeline Follow -Back  (TLFB; Sobell & Sobell, 1992): The TLFB obtains retrospective self -report of substance 
use by using a calendar and memory prompts to stimulate recall. Quantity and frequency assessments are 
made using this instrument (e.g., total number of standard drink units, percent of days using) as well as 
abstinence (yes/no). TLFB yields consistently high test -retest correlations and correlates well with other self -
reports and collateral reports. The TLFB will assess consumption of alcohol (standard drink units) for 60 days 
prior to study entry, during the treatment and follow -up phase. Use of nicotine and other drugs of abuse, 
including prescription drugs, will also be assessed using the TLFB.

V4.19.19  • Alcohol Breathalyzer Test  will be used to measure blood alcohol concentration (BAC) on a weekly basis  for in 
person visits . Samples reading >0.01 g/dl will be considered positive.  
• Alcohol Saliva Test  will be used to measure blood alcohol concentration (BAC) on a weekly basis  for telehealth 
visits. In front of the camera, p articipants will open the one time use test strip, place strip on tongue for 10 
seconds, then hold test strip and a color chart to the camera for a study team member to assess. Samples 
reading >0.01 g/dl will be considered positive.  
• Obsessive Compulsive Dr inking Scale  (OCDS; Anton et al., 1995): The OCDS is a 14 -item self -report measure 
of craving with high internal consistency and concurrent validity , and goo d predictive validity of future drinking 
(Anton et al., 1995; Drobes & Thomas, 1999).  It will be used to assess craving.  
• Visual Analog Craving Scale (VAS):  A Modification of the Within Session Rating Scale (Childress et al., 1986) 
will be used to assess subjective ratings including craving (amount, frequency) , stress  and mood, with anchors 
from 0 = “none” to 10 = “extreme”.  
• Visual Analog Scale (VAS) fMRI : A modification of the Within Session Rating Scale (Childress et al., 1986) will 
be used to assess subjective ratings including craving and stress before and after the fMRI s can.   
• Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol -Revised (CIWA -Ar; Sullivan et al., 1989): The CIWA -Ar is 
a widely used, 10- item clinician administered instrument that will be used to assess alcohol withdrawal 
symptoms. Subjects experiencing significant withdrawal, as evidence by a score of > 10, will be assessed by 
the Study Physician (Dr. Hamner) and referred clinically for medically supervised detoxification.  
• Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test  (AUDIT; Babor et al., 2001) : The AUDIT is a 10 -item self-report  
screening measure, developed by the World Heal th Organization (WHO), with three subscales (alcohol 
consumption, drinking behavior, and alcohol -related problems) . Items are summed for a total score of 40. The 
AUDIT has good internal consistency (αs = .80- .93) as well as sensiti vity and specificity .    
• Urine Drug Screen (UDS) tests:  Urine samples will be tested with a Multi -Drug Panel Test, which allows for 
the detection of THC/Marijuana, Cocaine, P hencyclidine, Opioids, Methamphetamines, Amphetamines, 
Barbiturates, and Benzodiazepines.  
• Ethyl glucuronide (EtG ): The conjugated alcohol metabolite EtG remains positive in urine for several days 
following cessation and is a useful biomarker of drinking in outpatient settings ( Litten et al., 2010 ). This will be 
used as a biologic assessment of drinking, as breathalyzer tests only assess very recent alcohol use. The 
assay will be done at  MUSC on samples collected at medication initiation, week 4, w eek 8 (end of treatment) , 
and the follow ups.   
• Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) : Assesses the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine 
related to cigarette smoking. There are six questions that provide a total score range of 0- 10, higher scores 
indicate a higher physical dependence (Heatherton, et al., 1991).  It will be administered at baseline.  
 
Trauma History and PTSD  
• Clinician Administered PTSD Scale  (CAPS; Weathers, Keane, & Davidson, 2001): The CAPS for DSM -5 is a 
30-item structured diagnostic interview and gold standard for assessing PTSD (Weathers et al., 2014 ). The 
CAPS has excellent psychometric properties and diagnostic efficiency (Weathers  et al., 2001). The CAPS- 5 
was revised to accommodate changes made in DSM -5, reduce administration time, and facilitate scoring 
procedures.  
• PTSD Checklist  (PCL -5; Weathers et al., 2013): The PCL -5 is a 20 -item self -report measure. The PCL- 5 is 
similar in form to the PTSD Checklist (PCL) based on the DSM -5 (Weathers et al., 1993), which has excellent 
psychometric characteristics for screening and as a secondary indi cator of PTSD symptom severity  (McD onald 
& Calhoun, 2010).  
• Life Events Checklist for DSM -5 (LEC -5; Weathers et al., 2013): The LEC -5 assesses lifetime exposure to 
trauma. It includes the list of 16 different events from the orig inal LEC. In addition, two items screen for military 
sexual trauma. The primary addition to the LEC -5 is a category involving occupational exposure (e.g., 
paramedic, police, or other first responder) .  
• Childhood Trauma Questionnaire- Short Form  (CTQ -SF; Bernstein et al., 2003): The CTQ is a 28 -item self -
administered  inventory that assesses childhood abuse and neglect. The CTQ -SF contains subscales including 
physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and physical and emotional neg lect.

V4.19.19  • Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations: Situation Specific Coping (CISS: SCC) : Assesses an individual’s 
coping preferences for a designated event (Endler & Parker, 1990).  
Depression and Suicidality  
• Beck Depression Inventory -II (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996): The 21 -item BDI-II is one of the most widely used 
instruments for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms.  Total s cores reflect minimal (0 -13), mild (14-
19), moderate (20 -28), or major depress ive symptoms (29 -63).  
• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Sc ale (C-SSRS; Posner et al., 2007):  The C -SSRS will be used to assess 
past/li fetime and current  suicide ideation. It will be administe red at baseline (for study eligibility) , week 4 and 
week 8,  and additionally as needed during the trial to monitor subject safety.  
Associated Areas of Functioning  
• Deployment Risk and Resiliency Inventory -2 (DRRI -2): The DRRI -2 (Vogt et al., 2012) is a suite of 17 individual 
scales that assess key deployment -related risk and resilience factors with demonstrated implications for 
Veterans’ long -term health. The following subscales will be used to as sess deployment factors: Combat 
Experiences . We will use the Post -Deployment Life Events and Support scales to evaluate post -deployment 
factors for Veterans.    
• CNS Vital Signs Cognitive Testing:  A battery of two tests (Stroop & Shifting Attention)  will assess 
neurocognitive functions.  
 
Compensation:  Participants will be compensated $50 for the baseline visit,  $50 for each imaging visit , $40 for 
each completed weekly visit , and $75 for completing  each of  the follow -up visi ts. They will be given a $25 bonus 
if the baseline/first visit is attended as scheduled. Participants who previously consented to the optional 
neuropeptide Y will receive $15 compensation for completing the second blood draw. Thus, participants may 
receive up t o $755 for completing all visits . Compensation is available in the form of  cash , gift card, or check.  
 
Telehealth participants will be offered compensation for travel  to and from  the three mandatory in- person visits 
(Baseline, Week 4, & Week 8).  
 Neuroimaging Component : Given the severe negative outcomes associated with co- occurring AUD /SUD and 
PTSD and lack of effective treatments, investigation of the neural circuitry and neurochemistry underlying 
AUD/ SUD/PTSD and involved in positive therapeutic  response could be important in guiding future treatment 
development studies . To that end, fMRI and 
1H-MRS data will be acquired at baseline and end of treatment on 
a subset (n =40) of participants to examine (a) glutamate concentrations, (b) resting state connectivity, and (c) 
response to alcohol /drug , trauma, and neutral cues. Scans will be conducted at the MUSC Center for Biomedical 
Imaging .  
 
The neuroimaging component will involve three visits, each lasting 60 -90 minutes. During visit 1, we will develop 
the personalized imagery scripts for alcohol /drug , trauma , and neutral cues . During visit 2 (pr e-treatment) and 
visit 3 ( end of treatment ), we  will conduct the fMRI and 1H-MRS scanning procedures. Imagery scripts will be 
similar to those developed according to standardized procedures (Sinha & Li, 2007)  and em ployed in our ongoing 
research .  
 
Upon arrival to the imaging facility (Center for Biomedical Imaging) , participants will first participate in a mock 
scanning session to acclimate to the MRI scanner and to practice using the joystick before completing the actual 
MRI scan. After mock scanning, participants will  be screened for metal using  a handheld metal detector. Trained 
staff will position individuals  on the scanner bed with foam padding placed around their head to prevent motion. 
Participant s will wear ear buds to listen to the audio- recorded scripts.  For co -registration and normalizat ion of 
functional images, a high resolution T1- weighted MPRAGE anatomical image will be acquired with the following  
parameters: TR = 23 00ms, TE = 2.26ms , flip angle = 8°, field of view = 256mm, slice thickness 1.0 mm. The 
scanning planes will be oriented parallel to the anterior commissure– posterior commissure line.  The ACC voxel 
for 1H-MRS will be placed on midsagittal T1- weighted images, anterior to the genu of the corpus callosum, with 
the ventral edge of the voxel aligned with the dorsal edge of the genu and a voxel size of 3 x 2.5 x 2.5cm.

V4.19.19  Following auto- shimming, single -voxel water -suppressed 1H-MRS spectra will be acquired using a Point 
Resolved Spectroscopy (PRESS ) sequence: Repetition Time (RT)  = 2000ms; Echo Time (TE) = 40ms; number 
of averages = 128 ; an unsuppressed water spectrum will be co- acquired (TE = 40ms, number of averages = 16), 
scaled for partial volume effects and relaxation, and used as a concentration reference (Mullins  et al. , 2008) .  
 
Participants will be asked to relax and keep their eyes opened and fixed on a cross -hair for two six-minute  runs 
while resting state data are collected. Following this, participants will be exposed to alcohol /drug , trauma and 
neutral cues, which will be audio recorded descriptions of the most recent time they used alcohol /drug , details 
of a traumatic event, and details about a relaxing event . 
 We will use a block design consist ing of a single run  in which 4 task blocks alternate with rest blocks. The 4 task 
blocks consist of a neutral cue followed by a trauma cue followed by a neutral cue then an alcohol/drug cue. To 
minimize potential carry -over effects, the order of task blocks  will be counterbalanced so that half of the subjects  
in the placebo group and half of the subjects  in the NAC group are exposed to the alcohol /drug  cue first and the 
remaining participants in each group are exposed to the trauma  cue first.  This order will be repeated at the end 
of treatment scan.  T2*-weighted gradient -echo planar images (EPI) will be acquired with the following 
parameters: TR = 1100ms , TE = 30ms , flip angle = 65º, mat rix 64 x 64, field of view = 192mm , slice thickness = 
3.0mm, with 48 slices to cover the en tire brain.  
 
Statistical Analyses: Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics will be collected and contrasts 
performed between treatment groups. Baseline characteristics found to be significantly associated with primary 
outcome measures will be included as covariates in the analyses . In general, less than 10% missing data have 
little impact on power and do not introduce bias, regardless of the missing data mechanism. If the percent missing data are greater than 10%, propensity score methods will be used for data imputation.  
 
We plan to use REDCap for data capture and management. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) 
is a software toolset and workflow methodo logy for electronic collection and management of research and 
clinical trial data (Harris et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2007).  REDCap provides secure, web
--based flexible 
applications,  including real time validation rules with automated data type and range checks at the time of 
entry. Exports are made available  for several statistica l packages including SPSS, SAS, SATA, R and 
Microsoft Excel.  
  
Power and Sample Size Estimation . It is expected that subjects treated with NAC, as compared to placebo, 
will exhibit significantly lower PTSD symptoms and craving at week 8. The effect sizes for these analyses ( d = 
1.27, d = 1.03, respectively) are based on our PoP data. A sample size of 26  would provide power (1 -ß) of . 80 
to detect a large  effect size with a Type 1 error protection level of .05  (Cohen, 1988). It is expected that NAC, as 
compared to placebo, will exhibit significantly lower AUD/SUD severity at week 8. To date, no published studies 
have examined NAC for the treatment of AUD.  Assuming a medium effect size ( d = .2), with a Type 1 error 
protection level of .05 and (1 -ß) = .80, a total sample of 58 would be required. Recent unpublished pilot data 
conducted by our group examining the effects of NAC vs . placebo on standard number of drinks among  patients 
with cocaine dependence and comorbid AUD (n=28) found a statistically significant treatment group e ffect. With 
regard  to neuroimaging, a  recent study of 29 individuals (PTSD=14, controls=15) observed significant differences 
in PFC -AMY resting state connectivity  (Sripada et al., 2012) . The effect size for this difference was 0.8 (Cohen’s 
d). Thus, power (1 -ß) reaches .80 with a total sample size of N=26 (two- tailed, α = .05). Another s tudy of 45 
cocaine- dependent individuals showed that lower PFC -AMY connectivity at baseline predicted relapse (McHugh 
et al., 2014) . The effect size for this reduction was 1.0. Thus, power (1- ß) reaches .80 with N=34 subjects (two-
tailed, α = .05).  
 Hypotheses: The hypotheses and statistical approaches for testing each hypothesis are listed below.   
Hypothesis 1:  NAC  treatment will result in significantly greater reduction in AUD /SUD severity and craving, as 
compared to placebo.  To test this hypothesis, a mixed effects modeling framework will be specified with the

Disorders

V4.19.19  total number of standard drinks cons umed and the OCDS total score as the primary outcome s. A Poisson 
distribution will be assumed with a logarithm link function to assess the effects of NAC  treatment . Data collected 
in substance abuse studies often contain a preponderance of zeros , and these zeros in the distribution can be 
considered sampling zeros in the Poisson process (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2011) . If this excess is present in the 
distribution, two- part Hurdle models (Poisson  and NB) will be explored (Cragg et al., 1971 ). The hurdle part of 
the model will allow us to estimate the probability of abstinence during the study period (as an odds ratio) while 
the Poisson/NB portion will allow for the assessment of the risk of an increase in using days beyond zero during 
the study  period (as  a risk ratio). Baseline alcohol /substance use and craving will be included in pertinent models 
as covariates. Additional alcohol /substance  use outcomes will be assessed: change in p ercent drinking days, 
percent heavy drinking days, EtG, and VAS craving levels .  
Hypothesis 2:  NAC treatment will result in significantly greater reduction in PTSD severity (CAPS- 5) as compared 
to placebo. To test  this hypothesis , generalized linear mixed effects regression models with a Gaussian 
distribution will be developed to assess group differences while adjusting for baseline CAPS -5 scores.  
Assumptions of residual normality and homosc edasticity will be checked using statistical test and graphical 
methods (Residual and Q -Q plots, and Shapiro- Wilk tests) and transformation will be done as necessary . 
Restricted maximum likelihood methods will be used to estimate the fixed effects and variance components.  
Additional outcomes ( e.g., PCL-5, CAPS- 5 symptom subscales ) will be examined.   
Hypothesis 3A:  Prefrontal cortex -amygdala connectivity at rest and in response to alcohol /drug  vs. neutral cues 
will predict reduction in alcohol /substance  use severity (total standard drinks).  
 
Hypothesis 3B:  Prefrontal cortex -amygdala connectivity at rest and in response to trauma vs. neutral cues will 
predict  reduction in PTSD severity (CAPS- 5). 
 
For hypotheses 3A and 3B, t he following preprocessing and analytical parameters will be used. Preprocessing : 
Post-acquisition preprocessing and statistical analysis of imaging data will be performed using FEAT (FMRI 
Expert Analysis Tool) Version 5.98, part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library). Data will be preprocessed using 
scripting tools from FEAT . Non-brain sig nal will be removed using FSL’s BET brain extraction. Scans will be 
corrected for motion using FSL’s linear registration and scans will be spatially smoothed. Participants with head motion > 0.2 mm will be excluded from the analyses
  (Power et al., 2012 ). Motion artifacts will be identified and 
scrubbed from each subject’s data. Scans will be spatially co- registered with a standardized anatomical template 
(Montreal Neurological Institute) using a 12 parameter affine transformation. Analysis:  Functional connectivity 
will be measured using a psychophysiologic interaction (PPI) seed -based approach  (Friston et al., 1997) . PPI 
analysis is used to assess the functional coupling between different  brain regions. The PPI is defined as the 
change in connectivity of one area (i.e., the seed region) to another in relation to the experimental context (e.g., 
alcohol vs. neutral cues). PPI analyses for resting state, trauma and alcohol /drug  cues will be performed 
separately. Customized sq. wave forms representing the trauma run (1=trauma block and -1=neutral block) and 
the alcohol /drug  cue run (1=alcohol /drug  block and -1=neutral block) will be convolved with a double- gamma 
hemodynamic response function. A  mask of the seed region will be made using a 12 -mm diameter sphere 
located in the center of the AMY using the MNI coordinates (x, y, z = ±22, 0, -22). The transformation parameters 
described above will also be applied to the mask. For each subject, the mean corrected and high pass filtered 
time series of the BOLD signal in the AMY  will be extracted and used in a single subject whole brain PPI analysis. 
The PPI model will include the task vector, time series of the BOLD signal in the AMY , a term representing the 
positive task x seed interaction, and a term representing the negative task x seed interaction. The first level 
analysis will generate contrast images of the parameter estimates for each of the four regressors. Voxels will be 
thresholded at Z  > 2.3 using a corrected cluster threshold of p=0.05. The contrast images of the parameter 
estimates of the positive and neg ative task x seed interactions will be combined for group -level t -tests to identify 
regions that exhibited altered connectivity with the AMY  during the trauma and alcohol /drug  cues as compared 
to neutral cues. All group -level results will be thresholded at  Z > 2.3 using a corrected cluster threshold of p=0.05. 
Separate linear regression tests will be used to test for associations between PFC -AMY connectivity at baseline 
and improvement in AUD /SUD and PTSD symptoms during treatment. Changes in total standard  drinks will be

significant task x seed interaction with the AMY  at rest and in response to the alcohol /drug  cues (Hypothesis 
3A). Changes in CAP S-5 total scores will be regressed against the parameter estimate obtained from the center 
voxel from each cluster that exhibited a significant task x seed interaction with the AMY  at rest and in response 
to the trauma cue (Hypothesis 3B ). Further exploratory analyses will examine change in PFC -AMY connectivity 
from pre - to post -treatment and associations with other alcohol /drug  and PTSD outcomes, both within and 
between medication groups.

Estimated date first subject  enrolled :  March 5 , 2018 
Estimated date last subject  completed:  September 5 , 
2018 Phase of development: IV 
 
Objectives: The main objective of this study is to assess subject satisfaction after treatment 
with A -101 40% on SKs of the face, neck, and décolletage.  
Methodology:  
Subjects will be n aive to A -101 (Hydrogen Peroxide) Topical Solution, 40% (w/w) 
treatment.  D ermatologists  will identify 3 eligible  target  SKs on each subject ; 2 target SK s 
must be on the face, and the additional 1 target SK  must  be on the neck or décolletage .  Up to  
4 additional non- target SKs may  be identified on the face, neck or décolletage.  Each SK 
must be treated by a study trained healthcare provider  at the site .  Each target and non- target 
SK will be treated during up to 3 separate treatment visits : Visit 2 , Visit 5 and Visit 7.  Each 
treatment visit requires up to 4 applications of  A-101 (Hydrogen Peroxide) Topical Solution, 
40% (w/w) to each eligible target and non -target SK .  Each application will last up to 20 
seconds with about 60 seconds between applications. 
 
A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled.  S ubjects will be interviewed by the study staff prior 
to study medication application to assess their dermatological medical history.  A trained 
photographer will document each subject’s SK s at every visit , and during Visit 2, subjects 
will have photographs  taken of each SK at specified post treatment timepoints.   
Subjects will be assessed for adverse events  related to study medication  throughout the 
conduct of the study.

Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 
Version 3:  18 JUN 2018

    Criteria for evaluation: 
Primary:  
• Subject satisfaction after treatment with A -101 ( Hydrogen Peroxide ) topical solution, 
40% (w/w ) at Day 85 and Day 113.  
Secondary:  
• Effectiveness of treatment as measured by the PLA at Day 85 and Day 113. 
• Compa rison of  the PLA score(s) to treatment satisfaction at Day 85 and Day 113. 
 
Statistical methods:  
Efficacy Analysis:  
Descriptive statistics will be used to su mmarize the data .  Descriptive statistics will be used 
to summarize the effectiveness for this study.  The focus of the analyses will be the 
evaluation of the relationship between lesion outcomes and subject satisfaction scores from 
each of the subject  satisfaction scales.  Because satisfaction is assessed on a subject  level and 
not for each individual lesion, it will be necessary to first summarize multiple lesion 
outcomes into one score for each subject  visit.  The analyses will then be implemented at 
each applicable visit by calculating separate Pearson correlations coefficients between (1) 
mean change from baseline in per -subject  averaged PLA scores across all lesions, and (2) 
each subject  satisfaction scale score at the visit.  As a sensitivity analysis, the above statistics 
will also be calculated using Spearman’s rank -order correlation.  Exploratory analyses 
similar to the above will also be conducted between (1) per -subject  averaged percent of 
treated lesions clear (PLA = 0) and (2) each subject  satisfaction scale score .  A similar 
exploratory analysis will also be conducted using per -subject averaged percent of lesions 
clear or near -clear (PLA < 2).  Additional multiple regression models may be used across 
groups of subject  satisfaction scales, depending on the pattern of individual subject  
satisfaction scale outcomes.  
 
Safety Analysis:  
Safety endpoints for adverse events (AEs) include the following: incidences of all treatment -
emergent AEs  (TEAEs) , and all serious AEs (SAEs); by severity, and discontinuation of 
subjects  from study due to AEs.  Safety endpoints for AEs  will be specified in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  All safety endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics .

    4. INTRODUCTION 
Summary  
Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is one of the most common skin tumors in man.  These benign 
epithelial skin tumors are most commonly seen in older individuals, increasing in prevalence 
with increasing age, and aff ect men and women roughly equally.  While the growths may be 
solitary, they often occur in large numbers and typically present as well demarcated, elevated or 
“stuck -on” appearing papules or plaques that may vary from flesh- colored, to shades of yellow, 
gray, brown, or black (Haffner C 2008).  
Though benign, SK lesions are often cosmetically worrisome to patients, must sometimes be 
distinguished from other benign or malignant skin tumors and may become pruritic, irritated, 
bleed, and may be painful when traumatized particularly when located in areas prone to friction 
and trauma, such as belt -lines and brassiere- strap lines.  
Patients may seek treatment of SK for cosmetic reasons, especially if they are large, pigmented, 
and/or if multiple lesions are present, or simply because the lesions are commonly associated 
with “old age”.  Removal may be medically indicated, however, for lesions that become irritated, 
pruritic, inflamed, or painful, or for lesions that the clinician feels require histologic confirmation 
of the diagnosis. 
Numerous treatment options exist and include a plethora of destructive/ablative modalities such 
as liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, lasers of various wavelengths (ablative and 
non-ablative), radio -frequency ablation, and su rgical removal by curettage or surgical excision.  
There is, however, a notable lack of well -controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy, 
complications and complication rates of these treatments.  There is great variability among 
practitioners in the  methods employed using each of these techniques (e.g., variability in contact 
time and method of freezing the lesions with liquid nitrogen) with great variability of the results.  
None of these treatments is, in fact, approved by the Food and Drug Adminis tration (FDA) for 
the treatment of seborrheic keratosis.  While these methods can be effective, many require 
specialized training and/or the use of expensive equipment, they are painful and may require 
anesthesia and/or analgesia, and they are often compli cated by significant adverse outcomes.  
Both hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation, which may be transient, but are often 
permanent, are common, as is scarring at the treatment site, and the typical post -surgical risks of 
bleeding and infection increase t he risk that the result of the treatment of these lesions may be 
worse than the disease itself (Pierson DBC 2003) (Motley 2002) (McKee PH 2005).  
Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment.  It is the 
simplest peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods 
including chlorine -free bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, and disinfectants.  
Additionally, H 2O2 has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been 
used i n oral hygiene products and tooth- whitening systems for many years.  In industry, it is 
employed in the treatment of wastewater.  In high concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, 
pulp, and textiles.  Clinically, in addition to its use as an oral topi cal agent noted above, H 2O2 is 
widely employed at low concentrations ( e.g., 3% -6%) as a wound irrigant and topical 
antiseptic/disinfectant, and has been in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical 
practice by Richardson in 1858.  (Schumb WC 1955) (Chan HP 2008) (Richardson, On Peroxide 
of Hydrogen, or Ozone, or Water as a Remedy: Continued from a Research Commenced in the 
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 
Version 3:  18 JUN 2018

    Year 1858 1891) (Richardson, On Peroxide of Hydrogen, or Ozone, or Water, as a Remedy: 
Continued from Research Commenced in t he Year 1858 1891) (Richardson, On the Introduction 
of Peroxide of Hydrogen as a Medicine 1866) (Watt BE 2004)  (Zonios 2007). 
H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems.  The local deleterious effects of 
reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by the presence of a complex antioxidant 
defense system that includes, enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide 
dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, lipoamine, lipid peroxidase and others, as well as non-
enzymatic components including ascorbic acid, urates and uric acid, tocopherol, glutathione, 
ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other water -soluble  groups.  The local application of supra -
physiologic concentrations of H 2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, 
allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of 
reactive oxygen species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by the generation of local 
concentratio ns of O 2 that are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells.  
Data from a proof of concept study (A -101-SEBK -201) demonstrated that topical treatment of 
SK lesions with A -101 Solution 40% and 32.5% has the potential to safely and effective ly 
resolve SK lesions without the need for analgesia and/or anesthesia, and with a minimal risk of 
hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, or scarring. 
Further, data from two dose -ranging studies (A -101-SEBK -202 evaluating SK lesions on the 
trunk and extremit ies; A -101-SEBK -203 evaluating SK lesions on the face) demonstrated that 
topical treatment with A -101 Solution 40% is superior to both A -101 Solution Vehicle and A -
101 Solution 32.5% for safely and effectively treating seborrheic keratosis lesions in adult  
subjects and has an acceptable safety profile.  
 
Summary of Previous Clinical Trials with A -101 Solution in Seborrheic Keratosis  
A-101-SEBK- 301 
A-101-SEBK -301 was a randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel -group study of A 
101 and vehicle to investigate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability in subjects with SK target 
lesions on the trunk, extremities, and face.  Subjects randomized to the study were able to receive 
up to 2 applications of A -101 40% Solution or matching vehicle.  
A total o f 450 subjects were randomized and 435 (96.7%) completed the study.  Among the 15 
subjects who discontinued, the reasons were similar between the treatment groups with the most 
frequent being a protocol violation (2.6% vehicle, 2.2% A -101).  Two subjects ( 0.4% vehicle, 
0.4% A -101) discontinued due to an AE or SAE.  The mean age was 68.7 years (range 42 to 90, 
42.0% were at least 71 years old), 41.3% of subjects were male and 58.7% were female, and 
97.8% were Caucasian.  The most common Fitzpatrick skin type s were 2 (46.9%) and 3 (27.3%).  
Treatment with A -101 40% showed statistically significant efficacy compared to treatment with 
vehicle based on the primary analysis (supported by the sensitivity analyses) as well as the 
secondary and exploratory analyses.  
For the primary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subjects who achieved clearance (PLA = 0) of 
all 4 target lesions at Visit 8 (Day 106) was 4.0% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with vehicle (p 
= 0.0019).  For the secondary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subject s who achieved clearance of 
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402 
Version 3:  18 JUN 2018   
 22  
    at least 3 of the 4 target lesions at Visit 8 was 13.45% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with 
vehicle (p < 0.0001).  
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were reported for 45 (19.8%) subjects in the 
vehicle group and 54 (24.2%) subjects in the A 101 group.  The most frequently reported TEAEs 
were nasopharyngitis (3.1% vehicle, 1.3% A 101), bronchitis (0.4% vehicle, 1.3% A -101), and 
upper respiratory tract infection (1.3% vehicle, 0.4% A -101).  Six (2.6%) subjects in the vehicle 
group had 7 SAEs and 4 (1.8%) subjects in the A 101 group had 4 SAEs.  The SAEs were all 
considered not related to study medication.  Two subjects, 1 in each treatment group, 
discontinued the study due to an SAE.  
LSRs were few and predominantly mild.  The L SRs of pruritus and stinging reported by subjects 
and crusting, edema, erythema, hyperpigmentation, scaling, and vesicles reported by the 
investigator following treatment and retreatment had generally resolved by Visit 8 (Day 106).  
There were no clinically  significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital 
signs.  
 
A-101-SEBK- 302 
A-101-SEBK -302 was a randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel -group study of A 
101 and vehicle to investigate the effectiveness, safety, and toler ability in subjects with SK target 
lesions on the trunk, extremities, and face.  Subjects randomized to the study were up able to 
receive up to 2 applications of A -101 40% Solution or matching vehicle.  
A total of 487 subjects were randomized and 461 (94.7% ) completed the study.  Among the 26 
subjects who discontinued, the reasons were similar between the treatment groups with the most 
frequent being a protocol violation (2.9% vehicle, 4.5% A -101).  No subject discontinued due to 
an AE or SAE.  The mean age was 68.7 years (range 45 to 91, 41.5% were at least 71 years old), 
41.7% of subjects were male and 58.3% were female, and 97.9% were Caucasian.  The most 
common Fitzpatrick skin types were 2 (46.6%) and 3 (33.1%).  
Treatment with A -101 showed statistically significant efficacy compared to treatment with 
vehicle based on the primary analysis (supported by the sensitivity analyses) as well as the 
secondary and exploratory analyses.  
For the primary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subjects who achieved clearance  (PLA = 0) of 
all 4 target lesions at Visit 8 (Day 106) was 7.8% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with vehicle (p 
< 0.0001).  For the secondary endpoint, the proportion of ITT subjects who achieved clearance of 
at least 3 of the 4 target lesions at Visit 8 was 23.0% with A -101 compared to 0.0% with vehicle 
(p < 0.0001).  
TEAEs were reported for 43 (17.7%) subjects in the vehicle group and 46 (18.9%) subjects in the 
A 101 group.  The most frequently reported TEAEs were sinusitis (1.6% vehicle, 1.6% A 101), 
nasopha ryngitis (1.2% vehicle, 0.4% A -101), and herpes zoster (0.0% vehicle, 1.2% A -101).  
Four (1.6%) subjects in the vehicle group had 4 SAEs and 6 (2.5%) subjects in the A 101 group 
had 10 SAEs.  The SAEs were all considered not related to study medication.  N o subject 
discontinued the study due to a TEAE or SAE.

    LSRs were predominantly mild.  The LSRs of pruritus and stinging reported by subjects and 
edema, erythema, and scaling reported by the investigator following treatment and retreatment 
had generally res olved by Visit 8 (Day 106).  
There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital 
signs.  
A-101-SEBK- 303 
A-101-SEBK -303 was a large open -label safety study in which subjects received up to 4 
applications of A -101 40% Solution to SK lesions on their face, trunk or extremities.  
A total of 147 subjects were enrolled and treated and 139 subjects (94.6%) completed the study.  
Five subjects withdrew consent and 3 subjects were lost to follow -up.  The mean age was 68.4 
years (range 35 to 94, 40.1% were at least 71 years old), 32.0% of subjects were male and 68.0% 
were female, and 93.9% of subjects were Caucasian.  The most common Fitzpatrick skin types 
were 2 (48.3%) and 3 (32.0%).  
At Visit 12 (Day 148) in the ITT population, 10.9% of subjects had all 4 target lesions judged to 
be clear on the PLA (PLA = 0), 18.4% had at least 3 of 4 target lesions judged to be clear, and 
27.9% had all 4 target lesions judged to be clear or near clear (PLA ≤ 1).  In the PP population, 
the PL A average per -subject percent of target lesions judged to be clear at Visit 12 was 28.2%. 
TEAEs were reported for 25 (17.0%) subjects.  The most frequently reported TEAEs were 
cough, seasonal allergy, and sinusitis (2.0% each).  No TEAEs were reported as s evere, no SAEs 
were reported, and no subject discontinued the study due to an AE or SAE.  
LSRs reported were predominantly mild and most commonly included transient pruritus, 
stinging, crusting, edema, erythema, and scaling post -treatment that usually resolved by the next 
visit.  Few lesions had LSRs at Visit 12.  
There were no clinically significant changes during the study in laboratory evaluations or vital 
signs.  
All three of the phase 3 studies described above demonstrated that treatment with A -101 
(hydro gen peroxide) Topical Solution 40% was both effective and well -tolerated for the 
treatment of subjects with multiple seborrheic keratosis lesions of the trunk, extremities, and 
face.

    5. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
The rationale of this study is to understand a subject ’s experience and satisfaction after treatment 
with A -101 40% and how that correlates with a healthcare provider’s assessment based on PLA 
score.  
Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. recently completed three phase III clinical studies (301, 302, a nd 303) 
that demonstrated the safe ty and efficacy of A -101 40%  in treating S eborrheic K eratos es. 
5.1. Objective  
The objective of this study is to assess subject satisfaction after treatment with A -101 40% on 
SKs of the face, neck, and décolletage.

    6. INVESTIGATIO NAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This study is an open- label study designed to evaluate subject ’s satisfaction after  treatment of  
seborrheic keratos es with  A-101 40%.   The subject’s treatment application will be documented 
via a series of photographs to aid in the assessment of the treated SK  and to mimic real- world 
treatment environment .  
Dermatologists (investigators) will identify 3 eligible target S Ks on each subject; 2 target SK s 
must be on the face, and the additional 1 target SK  must be on the neck or décolletage.  Up to 4 
additional  non- target SKs may be identified on the face, neck or décolletage.  Each target and 
non-target SK  will be treated during up to 3 separate treatment visits : Visit 2 , Visit 5, and Visit 7.  
Each SK must be treated by a study trained healthcare provider  at the site .  Retreatment of 
identified target and non -target SK s will be determined by the physician using the Physicians 
Lesion Assessment Scale (PLA).  Target and non- target SK s that have been assigned a PLA of ≥ 
1 will be treated on Day 15 and Day 29.  Each treatment visit requires up to 4 applications of  A-
101 (Hydrogen Peroxide) Topical Solution, 40% (w/w)  to each eligible t arget and non- target SK .  
Each application will last up to 20 seconds with about 60 seconds bet ween applications. 
A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled.  A trained photographer will document each subject’s 
target and non- target SKs at every visit. D uring Visit 2 , subjects will have photographs taken of 
each SK at specified post treatment timepoints .   
Subjects will be assessed for  adverse e vents  related to A -101 40% throughout the conduct of the 
study.  
Subjects will be required to complete a total of 11 study visits.  The protocol defined study visits 
are: 
• Visit 1 (Day -13 - 0) Screening 
• Visit 2 (Day 1) Study Medication Treatment  
• Visit 3 (Day 2) Follow -up Visit 
• Day 4 (Day 8) Follow -up Visit  
• Visit 5 (Day 15) Study Medication Treatment (if PLA ≥ 1)  
• Visit 6 (Day 22 ) Follow -up Visit  
• Visit 7 (Day 29 ) Study Medication Treatment (if PLA ≥ 1)  
• Visit 8 (Day 36 ) Follow -up Visit  
• Visit 9 (Day 57 ) Follow -up Visit  
• Visit 10 (Day 85) Follow -up Visit  
• Visit 11 (Day 113 ) Follow -up Visit; End of Study

    Refer to Table 3:  Study Design and Schedule of Assessments  for a complete list of protocol 
required study assessments.  
6.2. Number of Subjects  
A total of 30 subjects will be treated on the study at 3 investigational sites in the US.  
6.3. Treatment Assignment  
This is an open- label study.  
6.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
If a subject refuses the  initial treatment or retreatment, the investigator must report the visit 
number, visit date, t arget SK number(s) that the subject refused to allow treatment for and the 
reason f or the refusal in the subject’s CRF.  
If the subject’s refusal is associated with an AE, the investigator must also report the event on the 
appropriate CRF.  
The subject must have the Visit 2 initial study medication treatment to all t arget SK s to remain in 
the study.  
The subject does not need to be removed from the study based solely on her/his refusal to have a 
study medication retreatment at Visit 5 or Visit 7.

    2Investigational sites will assign a unique five -digit subject identifier to each subject at Visit 1 , formatted as  NN-NNN where the first 2 digits are the site number , and the final 3 digits are 
the subject number  that must be assigned in ascending numerical order (using leading zeroes, as appropriate).  This subject identifier will be used in all study documentation  for the duration 
of the study.  
3Each subject’s skin must be assessed during Visit 1 using the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment.   Refer to Table 6 for the scale.  
4Vital signs [including temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, height and weight  (Visit 1 only)] will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 2 , Visit 5 , Visit 7  
Visit 10, and Visit 11 . 
5Prior medications/therapies will be collected for a time-period of 13 days prior to Visit 1.  Refer to Section 8.4 for a list of permitted and restricted concomitant medications.  
6The treating investigator will identify 3  target SKs and up to 4 non-target SKs.  Two ( 2) target SKs must be on the face, and the additional 1 target SK must be on the neck or décolletage.   
The 4 non-target SKs may be located on the face, neck, or décolletage.  
7The investigator will use the Physician’s Lesion Assessment (PLA) to assess the severity of each t arget and non-target SKs at Visits  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , 7, 10, and 11 .  At Visit 2 , Visit 5 and Visit 
7, the investigator must assess each  target and non- target SK prior to application of the study medication.  In order to be eligible for enrollment to the study during Visit 2, the subject must 
have a PLA grade ≥ 2  for each t arget and non-target SK. 
8The investigator will measure the dimensions of each t arget and non-target SK at Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 11 .  At Visit 2 , Visit 5  and Visit 7 , the investigator must measure each t arget 
and non- target SK prior to a pplication of the study medication.  In order to be eligible for enrollment to the study during Visit s 1 and  2, each target SK must have a diameter  that is between 
≥ 5 and ≤ 15 mm  (inclusive ) and  be raised .  In order to be eligible for enrollment to the study during Vis its 1 and  2, each non -target SK must be a raised SK.  At Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 the 
investigator must assess the thickness of each t arget and non-target SK above the surrounding skin.  Additional target and non- target SK requirements are outlined in Section  10.1 . 
9Each  target and non-target SK will be photographed at all study visits  using the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  supplied photography equipment . 
10During Visit 2  each target and non-target SK will be photographed prior to the application of A -101 40%, 10 minutes post application  (+2 minutes) , and 1-hour  post application (± 10 
minutes) .  During Visit 5 and Visit 7, the target and non-target SKs will be photographed prior to the application of A -101 40% , if applicable.  
11During Visit 3  each target and non-target SK will be photographed 24-hours post application during Visit 2 (± 2 hours).  
12 A-101 40%  will be applied to each target and non-target SK by a study trained healthcare provider  at the site .  Each  target and non-target SK will be treated  with A-101 40%  following 
confirmation of subject eligibility and study enrollment at Visit 2.  If a t arget or non-target SK meets the criteria for retreatment as defined in Section 9.5, the SK will be retreated at Visit 5 
and Visit 7 .  Following application of  A-101 40% , subjects must NOT wash/submerge a  target and non-target SK for at least 6 hours and they must NOT apply  any topical products to any  
target or non-target SK for at least 6 hours.  
13Subjects will be asked to assess how satisfied they are with the treatment experience they r eceived for the  target and non- target SKs at the specified visits .  On Visit 2  the subject will 
complete the assessment prior to application of A-101 40% .  On Visit 3  the subjects will complete the assessment approximately 24 hours after the treatment.  On Visit 6 and  Visit 8 the 
subjects will complete the assessment approximately 1 week after the treatment , only if the subject received treatment on Visit 5 or Visit 7 . The subject will complete the assessment during 
the Visit 1 0 and Visit 11 . 
14All concomitant therapie s including (topical and oral) prescription medications, over the counter medications , natural supplements and non-drug therapies including chiropractic, physical 
therapy, and energy -based therapy must be documented in the subject CRF.  Subjects must not a pply any topical products (e.g. , moisturizers, sunscreen, etc.) to their target and non-target 
SKs within 12 hours prior to any study visit.  
15The reporting period for SAEs  begins when the subject signs the informed consent  form .  Refer to Section  11.6  for instructions on the reporting of SAEs.  Non-serious clinical adverse 
events will be collected following the application of the study medic ation at Visit 2  and continue through Visit 11 .  All safety reporting (AEs and SAEs) will conclude at Visit 1 1.

 8.5.1. Preparing the Study Medication for Application 
To perform a study medication treatment for a t arget or non- target  SK a HCP at the site  will 
select the appropriate A -101 40%  applicator.  The following instructions outline the procedure 
for application of  A-101 40%  to the t arget or non -target  SK: 
• Prepare for the treatment:  
• Wash your hands prior to, and after completing  the A -101 40%  treatments  
• Wear nitrile or vinyl examination gloves during the treatment; latex gloves are 
prohibited 
• Select the applicator  
• Visually inspect the applicator for damage:  
• If the applicator appears damaged do not use it for the treatment, contact 
the study monitor for return/ disposal instructions and select an unused 
applicator for the treatment 
• If the applicator is intact, proceed with the treatment process as outlined in 
Figure 1  
 
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 35  
    
 Figure 1 : Diagram Showing the Process for Preparing and Applying A -101 40% 
 
1. Each target and non- target SK  should be cleaned using an alcohol wipe prior to 
application of A -101 40% . 
2. Hold the A -101 40%  applicator so that the applicator cap is pointing up.  
3. Crush the ampule  in the applicator by applying pressure to the center of the barrel of the 
applicator.  
4. Remove the sleeve.  
5. Tap the barrel  of the applicator to ensure the solution is free of the crushed ampule. 
6. Gently remove the cap by twisting while pulling away from the applicator.  
7. Express a single drop of A-101 40%  so that the tip of the applicator becomes wet.  
8. Apply the solution to the t arget or non- target SK  in a circular motion. 
8.5.2. Applying A -101 40%  to the Face, Neck or Décolletage  
To apply A-101 40%  to the target or non -target SK the HCP  will follow these treatment 
instructions:  
• Do not apply A -101 40% to eyes, mouth, mucous membranes, open wounds  

Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 36  
    
 • Do not apply A -101 40%  to the eyelids or within 5 mm of the orbital r im 
• If, in the investigator’s opinion it is needed to ensure no A -101 40% enters the 
eye: 
• Position the subject in the supine position with the head slightly elevated 
and angled such that any excess study medication will flow away from the 
eye. 
• Apply  white p etrolatum (100%) United States Pharmacopeia (USP) that is 
to be applied along the orbital rim and at the medial and lateral canthi; 
gently stretch the periorbital skin between the thumb and forefinger at the 
time of petrolatum application to distend any pe riorbital rhytides ( e.g., 
“crow’s feet”) and ensure full coverage of the skin at the base of the 
rhytides to decrease the likelihood of tracking of the study medication 
towards the eye  
• Have the subject hold an absorbent pad in the appropriate area of the e ye 
to absorb any excess study medication that might  track away from the 
target or non- target SK  
• Instruct the subject to keep both eyes closed during the entire study 
medication treatment procedure  
• After the subject is properly prepared and positioned, thor oughly cleanse the 
target or non- target SK by firmly rubbing with a swab/wipe wetted with 70% 
isopropyl alcohol  
• Using firm pressure, squeezing in the middle of the applicator, apply one drop of 
study medication onto the target  or non -target  SK and then move applicator 
around in a circular motion to fully saturate the SK .  Apply the study medication 
for approximately 20 seconds  
• Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin 
• During the treatment process remove excess study medication from the 
surrounding skin using a clean absorbent wipe  
• Ensure the t arget or non- target SK is wet with study medication at the end of the 
approximately 20 second application 
• Allow the t arget or non- target SK to remain undisturbed for approximately 60 
seconds  
• After approximately 60 seconds repeat the approximately 20 second application 
process  
Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study medication has been applied to each  target or 
non-target SK up to 4 times.  It is acceptable to treat the target and non -target SKs sequentially to 
minimize treatment time; such that, after treatment is applied to the 3rd SK, the 60 second wait 
time between applications would be met.  
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402

Record the approximate location of each t arget and non- target SK on the body chart in the CRFs. 
Number  the t arget SK starting with 1 and proceeding up to 3 with no number omitted or reused.  
The target SK s on the face should be numbered 1 and 2, and the additional 1 SK on the neck 
and/or décolletage should be numbered 3.  The non -target SKs should be numbered 4- 7 starting 
with 4 and proceeding up to 7 with no number omitted or reused.  
Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. will provide the investigational s ite with standard circular templates 
and colored stickers that are to be used to identify the t arget and non -target SKs. 
At Visit 1, the investigator and a HCP  will identify the t arget and non -target SK s by placing 2 
appropriately colored stickers approximately 180 degrees opposite each other with the t arget or 
non-target SK in the center of the area outlined by the provided circular template (Refer to 
Figure 2 .  Figure not to scale):  
Figure 2 : Target and Non -Target SK Identification  
 

Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 42  
    
 Write the t arget or non- target SK number on one of the identification (ID) stickers. The ID 
stickers must be visible in the study photographs.  The t arget and non- target SK #/ID sticker 
color relationships are:  
• Target SK on face#1/white ID stickers  
• Target SK  on face #2/yellow ID stickers  
• Target SK  on neck or décolletage  #3/green ID stickers  
• Non-Target SK  on the face,  neck or décolletage  #4/pink ID stickers  
• Non-Target SK  on the face, neck or décolletage #5/ grey ID stickers  
• Non-Target SK  on the face, neck or décollet age #6/purple  ID stickers  
• Non-Target SK  on the face, neck or décolletage #7/ orange  ID stickers  
At each study visit a HCP from  the investigational staff will confirm the location of each t arget 
and non- target SK using an appropriate combination of the Visit 2 hard -copy reference pri nts and 
the body charts. The staff member will identify the t arget and non- target SK s by placing 2 
appropriately colored ID stickers, with the target or non- target SK number written on one sticker, 
approximately 180 degrees opposite each other with the t arget or non- target SK in the center of 
area outlined by the provided circular template.  
10.1.1. Standardized Photography  
At each study visit a qualified investigational center staff member will take standardized color 
photographs of each t arget and non- target SK . 
The photographs are to document the location of the t arget and non -target SK and to assist with 
relocating the t arget and non- target SK and the t arget and non- target SK ID stickers must be 
visible in the photographs.  The subject’s identity will not be reve aled in the study photographs.  
These photographs will also be used to document the treatment effects of  A-101 40%  over time.  
At Visit 2, the photographs must be taken prior to the study medication application, 10 minutes 
post application, and 1- hour post application of A -101 40%.  At Visit 5 and Visit  7, the 
photographs will be taken prior to study medication application, if applicable.  At Visit 3 
photographs must be taken 24 hours post application of A -101 40% on Visit 2 . 
Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, subject positioning relative to the 
camera and camera settings are used for each photograph.  
Sites will be provided with photography equipment and supplies necessary for obtaining the 
target and non- target  SK photographs.  Detailed instructions for obtaining and managing the 
photographs will be documented in the study specific Photography Manual and provided to the 
site at the study initiation visit.  
10.1.2. Physician’s Lesion Assessment (PLA)  
The PLA is the investigator’s assessment of the severity of the t arget and non- target SK at a 
particular time point.   The investigator may refer to other evaluations ( e.g., prior photographs) to 
assist with these assessments.  
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 43  
    
 At Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 11 the investigator will assess the t arget  and non- target  SK using 
the scale below and report the one integer that best describes  the severity of the t arget  or non-
target  SK.  At Visit 2 and if applicable at Visit 5 and Visit 7, the investigator must complete the 
PLA prior to the study medication treatment.  
Table 5:  Physician’s Lesion Assessment Definitions  
Grade  Descriptor  
0 Clear: no visible seborrheic keratosis lesion  
1 Near Clear: a visible seborrheic keratosis lesion with a surface appearance different 
from the surrounding skin (not elevated)  
2 Thin: a visible seborrheic keratosis lesion (thickness ≤  1mm)  
3 Thick: a visible seborrheic keratosis lesion (thickness >  1mm)  
All investigational site staff  will receive training on the PLA Assessment Scale and be provided 
with a PLA Assessment Manual ( refer to Appendix 2) that will be used as a reference tool during 
the conduct of the study.  
In order for a subject to be eligible for screening and enrollment  to the study, each t arget and non-
target SK must have a PLA grade of ≥ 2.  
10.1.3. SK Dimensions  
At Visit 1 and Visit 2 prior to study enrollment, the investigator will measure the diameter  and 
thickness  of each t arget and non- target SK using the ruler provided.  
The investigator must measure the diameter of the longest axis  of each t arget and non- target SK 
in millimeters (mm) as follows:  
• Diameter  (i.e., the length of the longest axis)  
• Thickness (height above the surrounding skin)  
The PLA (the  thickness ) of the ta rget and non- target SKs will be measured by the investigator at 
Visits 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 11.  When the visit coincides with treatment (Visits 2, 5 and 7) , the 
thickness  must be measured prior to the application of  study medication . 
10.2. Subject Instructions  
An investigational center staff member will dispense a Subject Instruction Sheet to each subject 
at Visit 1 (Refer to Appendix 1).  
Throughout the study, the subjects should:  
• Continue their routine cleansing regimen  
• Continue their routine cosmetics and ski n care products  
• Avoid exposing the t arget and non- target SK s to excessive natural or artificial ultraviolet 
radiation ( e.g., sunlight, tanning beds) and use sunscreen on the t arget and non- target 
SKs, if excessive exposure cannot be avoided  
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 44  
    
 • Avoid the use of self -tanning lotions and spray tans  
• Bring the subject instruction sheet with them to each visit 
On study visit days, the subjects should:  
• When appropriate for the t arget and non- target SK  location s, wear loose fitting clothing 
to the visit (Note: clothin g that comes in contact with the study medication may be 
bleached)  
• Starting with Visit 2, not apply any  topical products to the t arget or non- target SK s within 
12 hours prior to the visit (Note: routine cleansing products are allowed)  
• After the completion of any study visit where a study medication treatment was 
performed DO NOT:  
• Wash/submerge the t arget or non- target SK s for at least 6 hours  
• Apply any topical products to the t arget or non- target SK s for at least 6 hours  
10.3. Subject Satisfaction Assessment  
Subjects will be asked to assess their level of satisfaction regarding the study medication 
treatment experience.  The subject survey will be completed at Visits 2, 3, 6  (only if treated at 
Visit 5) , 8 (only if treated at Visit 7) , 10, and 11. (See Appendi x 3) 
10.4. Study Supplies  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide:  
• An appropriate ruler, or other instrument, for measuring the diameter and thickness of the 
target ad non- target SK s 
• Templates for use when identifying t arget and non -target SK s 
• Equipment, supplies and training for taking standardized photographs

 11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
In addition to reporting  adverse events throughout the study the investigator, a designated and 
appropriately trained HCP  will perform the safety assessments according to the schedules noted 
below. 
11.1. Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 2 , Visit 5, Visit 7 Visit 
10, and Visit 11.  The following items will be measured: 
• Body temperature  
• Pulse rate  
• Respiration rate  
• Blood pressure (syst olic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes  
• Height (at Visit 1 only)  
• Weight (at Visit 1 only)  
Any measure that is, in the opinion of the investigator, abnormal AND clinically significant (CS) 
must be recorded as history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if 
found after the first study medication treatment begins (Section 11.6).  
A systolic blood pressure >140mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure >90mm Hg is considered 
abnormal and therefore must be defined as CS or NCS on the CRFs. 
11.2. Other Evaluations  
11.2.1. Demographic/Medical History  
At Visit 1, the investigator or designee will collect demographic information including date of 
birth, sex at birth, race , and ethnicity for each subject.  
At Visit 1, the inves tigator must determine each subject’s Fitzpatrick S kin T ype and document 
appropriately on the subject’s source document and CRF.  
Table  6: Fitzpatrick Skin Type Scoring System  
Skin Type Classification  Description  
Type  I Always burns, never tans (pale white; blond or red hair; blue eyes; freckles)  
Type II  Usually burns, tans minimally (white; fair; blond or red hair; blue, green, or 
hazel eyes)  
Type III  Sometimes mild burn, tans uniformly (cream white; fair with any hair or eye 
color)  
Type IV  Burns minimally, always tans well (moderate brown)  
Type V  Very rarely burns, tans very easily (dark brown)  
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 46  
    
 Skin Type Classification  Description  
Type VI  Never burns, never tans (deeply pigmented dark brown to darkest brown)  
11.3. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
11.3.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject that develops or worsens 
in severity during the conduct of a clinical study of a pharmaceutical product and does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship t o the study drug.  An adverse event can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under 
study ( or any concurrent disease), whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following:  
• intercurrent illnesses  
• physical injuries  
• events possibly related to concomitant medication  
• significant worsen ing (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other preexisting conditions.  
• drug interactions  
• events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study  
• laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities occurri ng after the start of the study (i.e., after 
screening and once confirmed by repeat testing) that results in the withdrawal of the  
subject from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work up, or is 
considered by the study investigator to be clinically significant.  
The investigator must, for any t arget or non- target SK  related AE, question the subject in detail 
to determine if there are any confounding factors ( e.g., irritation by clothing or activity, sunburn) 
for any such AE.  
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or 
clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE.  
The investigator must start reporting non -serious AEs starting with the subject’s first study 
medication treatment continuing through Visit 11.   
11.3.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in one or 
more of the following:  
• Results in death  
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 47  
    
 • It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a c ongenital abnormality or birth defect  
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subjec t or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe.  
Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject is admitted to the hospital 
on an in- patient bas is, even if released the same day.   Prolongation of hospitalization is defined 
as an additional night stay in the hospital.  Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
Impor tant medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death 
or hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in t he SAE definition above.  These 
should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization. 
11.4. Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study 
medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and 
consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal  relationship, location of the event, the subject’s 
relevant medical history, concomitant therapies and concurrent conditions) to determine the 
relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an 
AE to the st udy medication by selecting one of the following categories: 
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
study medication and the AE. 
Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal  relationship 
between the study medication and the AE.  
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A).  
11.5. Severity  
The investigator must define the severity of each AE using the following definitions as a 
guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and 
identify the severity that is the most appropriate according to her/his medical judgment.  
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 48  
    
 Intensity  will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild  - Awareness of sign o r symptom, but easily tolerated  
• Moderate -  Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities  
• Severe -  Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities  
11.6. Reporting Adverse Events  
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will question the subject to elicit AEs 
using a non- directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since the 
previous study visit?”   
The investigator or designee will monitor the subject for at least 20 minutes after the Treatment 
Completion Time at Visit 2 , and if applicable at Visit 5  and Visit 7 to elicit AEs in a similar 
manner.  
If appropriate, based on the subject’s response to non- directed questioning regarding AEs, the 
investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations.  
Non-serious AEs should be recorded starting with the subject’s first study medication tr eatment 
at Visit 2 and continuing thr ough Visit 11.   
All SAEs regardless of relationship to study medication must be collected and reported to Aclaris 
Therapeutics, Inc. from the time the Informed Consent is signed through Visit 11.   
Upon becoming aware of a SAE the investigator must:  
1. Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety  
2. Immediately inform the Safety Monitor of the SAE:  
 
Ken Kostenbader, MD  
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.  
640 Lee Road, Suite 200  
Wayne, PA 19087  
Telephone:  484- 848-7012 
Serious Adverse Event Facsimile:  484- 324-2359  
Email:  kkostenbader@aclaristx.com  
 
3. Within 24- hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any 
other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, 
laboratory test results) must be fax ed to the SAE Fax line listed above. 
4. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after 
the subject’s last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator the SAE reaches a 
clinically stable outcome with or witho ut sequelae AND the investigator and Safety  
Monitor agree that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved.  
5. Inform the Safety  Monitor of SAE updates by telephone followed by an SAE form update 
sent by fax or by e mail.  
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 49  
    
 6. Comply with the appropriate regulatory require ments and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. 
instructions regarding reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC).  
11.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event  
Any subject who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from study drug at any time at 
the discretion of the investigator.  If a subject is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed 
at that time.  The subject will be monitored until the event has resolved or stabilized, until a 
determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made, or until the 
subject is referred to the care of a local health care professional.  The investigator must inform 
the medical monitor as soon as possible of all subjects who are being considered for withdrawal 
due to adverse events.  Additional reports must be provided when requested. 
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402

 12. STATISTICS  
Statistical Analysis of Efficacy  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data for this study.   The focus of the analyses 
will be the evaluation of the relationship between lesion outcomes and subject  satisfaction scores 
from each of the subject  satisfaction scales.  Because s atisfaction is assessed on a subject  level 
and not for each individual lesion, it will be necessary to first summarize multiple lesion 
outcomes into one score for each subject  visit.  The analyses will then be implemented at each 
applicable visit by calcul ating separate Pearson correlations coefficients between (1) mean 
change from baseline in per -subject  averaged PLA scores across all lesions, and (2) each subject  
satisfaction scale score at the visit.  As a sensitivity analysis, the above statistics will also be 
calculated using Spearman’s rank -order correlation.  Exploratory analyses similar to the above 
will also be conducted between (1) per -subject  averaged percent of treated lesions clear (PLA = 
0) and (2) each subject  satisfaction scale score.  A simi lar exploratory analysis will also be 
conducted using per -subject  averaged percent of lesions clear or near -clear (PLA < 2).  
Additional multiple regression models may be used across groups of subject  satisfaction scales, 
depending on the pattern of indivi dual subject  satisfaction scale outcomes.  
 
Statistical Analysis of Safety Data  
Descriptive statistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the ITT  population. The 
proportion of subjects with adverse events  related to study medication  will be tabulated and 
presented by treatment and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System 
Organ Class. Vital signs, and clinically relevant abnormal laboratory results will also be 
tabulated and presented. No inferential testing will be performe d. 
Safety summaries will include listings of adverse events incidences within each MedDRA 
System Organ Class, and changes from pre -application values in vital signs. Adverse event 
summaries will be presented showing the proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events, 
both overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class. 
Interim Analysis  
An interim Analysis will not be conducted for this study.  
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 51  
    
 13. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
13.1. Study Monitoring  
The conduct of the study will be closely monitored by the Acla ris Therapeutics, Inc. study 
monitor /CRO to verify adherence to ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable 
SOPs, the protocol, other written instructions and regulatory guidelines.  
The investigator will allow the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. re presentative, designee and/or any 
regulatory agency to have direct access to all study records, CRFs, corresponding subject 
medical records, study medication dispensing records and study medication storage area, and any 
other documents considered source documentation.  The investigator also agrees to assist the 
representative, if required. 
13.2. Audits and Inspections  
The study is conducted under the sponsorship of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. in compliance with 
the applicable regulatory requirements as well as app licable ICH guidelines, Helsinki 
Declaration, and in respect of the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and/or sub- contractor SOPs for study 
conduct and monitoring.  
Audits may be carried out by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or its representatives and inspections 
may b e performed by regulatory authorities or IRB/ECs before, during or after the study.  The 
investigator will provide the auditing/inspecting group direct access to all study records ( e.g., 
CRFs, subject medical records, study medication dispensing records) a nd the investigational 
center study facilities. The investigator and study staff will be available and will assist the 
auditing/inspecting groups as appropriate.  
The investigator should contact Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. immediately if contacted by a 
regul atory agency about an inspection. 
13.3. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
This protocol and any accompanying material, including information that will be provided to 
prospective subjects (such as advertisements, subject information sheets, or study descriptions 
used to induce study participation or obtain informed consent) must be submitted to the IRB for 
approval.  Approval of each such submission must be obtained from the committee before it may 
be used in the study and must be documented in a written notificat ion to the Investigator 
specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and date on which the 
committee met and granted the approval.  In particular, each informed consent document must 
bear clear evidence (written, stamp, date of app roval, etc.) of IRB approval before it may be 
presented to prospective (or ongoing, as appropriate) study subjects for signature.  
Written evidence of the approval must be made available to the Sponsor.  Any modifications 
made to the protocol and of correspondingly modified informed consent documents made after 
receipt of IRB approval must also be submitted to the committee for approval before 
implementation unless the modification is made on an emergency basis to protect the welfare of 
study subjects.  In t he latter case, the IRB must be notified promptly, and their written approval 
must be obtained as soon after the fact as possible. 
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 52  
    
 Appropriate reports on the progress of the study will be made to the IRB and the Sponsor by the 
Investigator in accordance wi th applicable regulatory regulations and in conformity with policies 
established by both the IRB and the Sponsor.  The shortest time interval between required reports 
required by either party or by regulations will prevail.  
The Investigator at each investi gative site, or his/her nominee, will be responsible for reporting 
any SAEs to the IRB as soon as possible, and in accordance with the guidelines of the IRB.  
The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting all serious, life threatening or fatal adverse study  
drug events with a causal relationship to the study drug to appropriate regulatory agencies within 
their required timelines.  
The Investigator is responsible for obtaining written, informed consent(s) from each prospective 
subject interested in participating in this study before performing any study -related procedures.  
Written informed consent must be obtained after adequate, thorough, and clear explanation of the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study, as well as any use of the subj ect’s 
genetic information from the study.  The Investigator must use the most current Central IRB -
approved consent form for documenting written informed consent.  Each informed consent will 
be appropriately signed and dated by the subject.  The investigati onal site must retain the original 
signed consent and provide a copy to the subject. 
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 53  
    
 14. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
14.1. Protocol Amendments 
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IEC/IRB, except when necessary to 
eliminate immediate safety concerns to the subjects or when the change involves only logistics or 
administration.  The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the pr otocol amendment.  
14.2. Protocol Deviations, Violations, and Exceptions 
A protocol deviation  is non- adherence to protocol -specific study procedures or schedules that 
does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, and/or GCP 
guidelines.  Deviations are considered minor and do not impact the study.   
A protocol violation  is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specific inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, subject is administered a prohibited medication during the active protocol  treatment 
period, primary objective variable criteria, and/or GCP guidelines.  Protocol violations will be 
identified and recorded, by study center personnel, on the CRF. 
As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptions  to protocol -specific en try criteria 
to allow subjects to enter a study.  If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered 
ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular subject, prior approval from 
sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in ac cordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard 
Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the subject will be allowed to enter the study.  If 
investigative center personnel learn that a subject who did not meet protocol eligibility criteria 
was entered in a st udy (a protocol violation), they must immediately inform sponsor/CRO.  Such 
subjects will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and 
written approval by sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicabl e SOP  
14.3. Training  
For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study 
subjects.  
It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study 
coordinators or other applicable personnel att end this visit.  During this visit, participants will be 
trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs.  Those unable to attend the 
initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appropriately trained individual prior to 
particip ating in any of the procedures and evaluations in this study.  
Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to 
study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), 
the protocol and other study specific items.  Team organization, communication and operational 
issues will also be discussed.  
Aclaris Therapeutics, In c. will provide an investigator site  file to each center.  
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 54  
    
 15. ETHICS  
15.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The Sponsor will  use information developed in this clinical study in connection with the 
development of A -101 40% and, therefore, may disclose it as required to other clinical 
Investigators participating in other studies and to regulatory agencies.  In order to allow the use 
of the information derived from this clinical study, the Investigator understands that he/she has 
an obligation to provide all data produced during this study to the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor considers that clinical data (complete or incomplete) constitute financially sensitive 
information.  Consequently, the Sponsor requires that discussion of results in any form, 
electronic, verbal, or written before study completion and full reporting should only be 
undertaken with the Sponsor’s prior written consent. 
Individual subjects’ medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered 
confidential.  The Investigator and the study center will adhere to all applicable laws relating to 
the protection of subject information.  To assure that subjects’ conf identiality is maintained, 
subjects’ data will be identified by a study -assigned number and date of birth only.  
All Sponsor personnel will handle subjects’ data in a confidential manner in accordance with 
applicable regulations governing clinical research.   Subjects’ records will be inspected only in 
connection with this research project.  Information generated as a result of a subject’s 
participation in this study may be disclosed to third parties for research and regulatory purposes 
in any country as dete rmined by the Sponsor.  However, subjects will not be individually 
identified but will be referred to only by the study assigned number and the subject’s date of 
birth. 
15.2. Written Informed Consent  
The schedule of study activities (including assessments, tests , exams, disease assessments, and 
study drug administration) beginning with screening and continuing through the end of study are 
outlined in Table 3.  A written, signed informed consent form (ICF) must be obtained from each 
subject prior to performing any  study related procedure ( e.g., vital signs, clinical laboratory 
sampling, or photog raphy).  
The Principal Investigator at each center will ensure that the subject  is given full and adequate 
oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible r isk and benefit of the study.  
Subject s must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time.  The 
subject  should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the 
information provided.  
The subject ’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study 
procedures.  
The Principal Investigator must maintain the original, signed Informed Consent Form.  A copy of 
the signed Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject . 
 
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 55  
    
 16. DATA H ANDLING AND RECORDKE EPING  
16.1. Inspection of Records  
Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for 
the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study.  The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor 
to inspect the drug storage area, study drug inventory , drug accountability records, subject charts 
and study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 
16.2. Data Management  
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study.  The data 
collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets 
the technical requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11.  The 
CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical 
requirements of the study before it is used to capture data from this study.  Before using the 
CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study specific training.  After they are 
trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights.  
The handling of data, in cluding data quality assurance, will comply with regulatory guidelines, 
including ICH and GCP, and the sponsor/CRO SOPs and working instructions.  Data 
management and control processes specific to this study will be described in a data management 
plan.  At  the end of the study, the database will be locked, and the data will be released for 
reporting and statistical analysis.  
16.3. Regulatory Documents  
The investigator must maintain a study file containing current and complete regulatory 
documentation in complianc e with the current ICH E6 GCP guideline. This file will be reviewed 
as part of the routine monitoring for this study.  
16.4. Contractual Requirements 
A contractual agreement will be signed between Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and each investigator.  
This document w ill contain supplemental information, including financial terms, confidentiality, 
study schedule, third party responsibility, and publication rights.  
16.5. Retention of Records 
All pertinent data, samples, photographs, correspondence, original or amended protocol, reports 
and all other material relating to the study will be maintained securely in Aclaris Therapeutics, 
Inc. /CRO/investigator archives for the legally required duration for archiving.  
The investigator should maintain the essential study documents as specified in ICH GCP, and in 
compliance with all regulatory requirements. The investigator should ensure these documents are 
protected from accidental destruction or disposal. 
If the Investigator needs to re -assign responsibility for maintaining these documents ( e.g., due to 
retirement) it must be transferred to a person willing to accept this responsibility.  The 
Protocol A -101-SEBK -402   
 
 56  
    
 investigator must notify Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., in writing, of the name and address of the 
new individual. 
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigative site for any or 
all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the 
Sponsor to store these in sealed containers in an off -site storage location so that they can be 
returned to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required 
for the continued care of the subject, appropriate copies will be made for off -site storage.  
No trial document should be destroyed without prior written agreement  between the Sponsor and 
the Investigator. Should the Investigator wish to assign the trial records to another party or move 
them to another location, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor in writing of the new 
responsible person and/or the new location

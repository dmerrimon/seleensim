Title of Study:  A Study to Document the Safety and Effectiveness of a New OVD  When Compared to a 
Control OVD    
 
Number of Clinical C enters:  Up to approximately eighteen  (18) clinical centers  in the United States.  
 
Objectives: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Bausch & Lomb  DVisc40 dispersive OVD 
compared to the Alcon VISCOAT® dispersive OVD when used in cataract surgery .  
 
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, controlled, randomized, monocular trial  evaluating the safety and effect iveness of 
the Bausch & Lomb DVisc40  dispersive OVD compared to the Alcon  VISCOAT® dispersive  OVD 
when used in cataract surgery.   Subjects will be randomized  to one of the two treatment groups in a  1:1 
ratio (DVisc40:VISCOAT®). 
 
The study purpose, procedures, and subject responsibilities will be explained to the potential participant. 
The subject's willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be determined. When it has 
been established that the subject is eligible and willing to participate, writ ten informed consent will be 
obtained. Written informed consent must  be obtained from each study subject prior to performing any 
study specific procedures which are NOT part of the Investigator’s routine standard of care. A complete 
ophthalmic examination will be done at the Preoperative Visit scheduled within 60 days prior to surgery. 
The preoperative examination will include specular microscopy of the central corneal endothelium to 
obtain a baseline central endothelial cell density (ECD) . Enrolled subject s who meet eligibility criteria 
will be seen according to the following schedule:

Study Materials :  
Test article: Bausch & Lomb DVisc40  OVD  is a sterile nonpyrogenic solution which is supplied in a 
disposable glass syringe delivering 1.0 ml of highly purified, medium  molecular weight Sodium 
Hyaluronate and Sorbitol . 
Comparator : Alcon VISCOAT® OVD is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution which is supplied in a 
disposable glass syringe delivering 0.75 mL  of highly purified, non -inflammatory medium molecular 
weight fraction o f Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate and Sodium Hyaluronate.

 Duration of T reatment:  
The duration of the treatment is anticipated to be approximately 15-20 minutes for the surgical 
procedure.  During t he surgical procedure,  the OVD  material should be carefully injected into the 
anterior chamber  using standard aseptic technique .  The OVD may be injected into the chamber  prior to 
and/or following removal of the crystallin e lens  in the operative eye . Instillation of the OVD  may protect 
the corneal endothelium from possible  damage arising from surgical instrumentation or ultrasonic energy 
during the cataract extraction surgery.   The OVD  may a lso be used to coat surgical inst ruments prior to 
IOL implantation.   For example, the internal surfaces of an IOL inserter are typically filled and/or coated 
with the OVD to provide lubricity during IOL compression and delivery into the eye.  Additional OVD , 
of the same product, may be in jected as needed throughout surgery to keep the anterior chamber fully 
formed and to re -inflate the capsular bag following cataract removal.  At the end of the surgical 
procedure  it is recommended that OVD be removed from the eye  as completely as practical by 
thoroughly irrigating and aspirating with a sterile irrigating solution.  
____________________________________________________________________________________  
Criteria for E valuation:  
Evaluation of safety will be assessed through the monitoring of IOP, intraocular inflammation (anterior 
chamber cells, flare and characterization),  and adverse events  during all post -operative visits .  
 
Evaluation of effectiveness will be assessed through the m onitoring of ECD  at postoperative follow -up 
visits.  
 
The following are the primary study variables:  
 
Safety:   
• The primary safety variable will be the proportion of subjects who experience at least one IOP 
measurement ≥ 30 mmHg  in the study eye at any follow -up visit.  
Effectiveness : 
• The primary effectiveness variable will be the ch ange in ECD  from baseline to Postoperative 
Visit 5 (90 Days ± 14 days) in the study eye.  
 
These safety and effectiveness variables will be compared between the test and control groups.  
_________________________________ ___________________________________________________  
Statistical M ethods:   
Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. Summaries for discrete variables will include the tabulation of frequencies 
and percentages.  
 
Following Markov chain Monte  Carlo imputation of missing IOP data, a  one-sided upper 95% 
confidence interval for the difference between the test and control groups (i.e., test – control) in the 
proportion of subjects  with at least one IOP measurement ≥ 30 mmHg  in the study eye at any follow -up 
visit will be constructed using the normal approximation to test the null hypothesis  for the primary safety 
variable  that the upper confidence limit of the 95% confidence interval for  the difference is  ≥ 0.117 . If 
the upper confidence limit is less than 0.117 , then the null hypothesis of inferiority will be rejected in 
favor of the alternative hypothesis of non -inferiority.   
 
Following Markov chain Monte Carlo imputation of missing cel l density data, a one -sided upper 95% 
confidence limit for the  mean  difference in percent ECD  loss between the test and comparator OVDs 
will be constructed . If the upper confidence limit is less than 5%, then the null hypothesis of inferiority 
for the prim ary effectiveness variable will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis of non -
inferiority.

 Sample Size C alculations:  
Regarding the proportion of subjects who experience at least one IOP measurement ≥ 30 mmHg  in the 
study eye at any follow -up visit , when the sample size in each group is 165 subjects, a two -group large -
sample normal approximation test of proportions with a one -sided 0.050 significance level will have 
95.17 % power to reject the null hypothesis t hat the test is inferior to the control (the difference in 
proportions, t - c, is 0.117  or greater) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the test is non -inferior 
to the control (the difference in proportions, t - c, is less than 0.117 ), assuming  that the expected 
difference in proportions is 0.0 00 and the proportion in the standard group is 0.117 . 
 
Regarding ECD loss, when the sample size in each group is 165 subjects, a two group 0.050 one -sided t -
test will have 93.90% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test is inferior to the control  (the 
difference in means, t - c, is 5% or greater) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the test is non -
inferior to the control (the difference in means, t - c, is le ss than 5%) , assuming that the expected 
difference in means is 0% and the common standard deviation is 14.2%.  
 
Assuming independence of the primary endpoints, the overall power of the study will be 95.17 % x 
93.90% = 89.36 %.  To allow for a dropout rate of up to 10%, a sample size of approximately 184 
subjects per treatment arm will be targeted for enrollment. The total enrollment target consequently will 
be approximately 368 subjects.

Ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) materials are widely used in cataract surgery to 
allow the maintenance of the anterior chamber  space , to re-inflate the capsular bag after 
cataract removal in order to create space for IOL insertion,  and to form a protective coating 
to protect the corneal endothelium from  surgical  instruments  and ultrasonic energy .  The 
retention and removal properties for a number of OVD materials approved in the past 20 
years has led to new OVD classificat ions and nomenclature  based on surgical needs during 
cataract surgery.1-4 
 
It is now recognized  there are two physical qualities that generally characterize  OVD in 
anterior eye surgery.  A highly cohesive OVD  will be easier to be completely removed from  
the eye at the end of surgery, which will reduce the likelihood of sudden increases in 
intraocular pressure (IOP)  due to obstruction of the aqueous draining system .  However , a 
cohesive OVD  may also be removed unintentionally during the normal irrigation and 
aspiration process or during inser tion and removal of objects through the corneal incision , 
potentially  resulting in less anterior chamber stability and less  protection for intraocular 
structures.  Conversely , a highly dispersive OVD  will maintain better levels of anterior 
chamber stabilit y and endothelial coating but may prove difficult to remove completely at the 
end of surgery.  The selection of OVD agent for each surgery can be influenced by individual 
patient anatomy and pre -existing medical conditions, as well as individual surgeon te chnique 
and preferences.  
 
Bausch & Lomb OVD dispersive material  (DVisc40) is intended  to provide surgeons with a 
new option in the continuum of cohesive and dispersive properties.  DVisc40 is intended  for 
use as a surgical aid in ophthalmic anterior segment procedures, including cataract extraction 
and IOL implantation.   DVisc40  creates and maintains space  during lens extraction and IOL 
implantation , aids in tissue manipulation during surgery, enhances  visualization during the 
surgical procedure, and protects the corneal endothelium and other intraocular 
tissues.   DVisc40  may also be used to coat IOLs  and instruments during ophthalmic anterior 
segment surgical procedures.  
  
Two parameters  have been comm only used in clinical trials to assess  the performance of 
OVD s:  1) IOP spikes, to measure how completely the OVD  can be removed from the eye at 
the end of surgery; and 2) ECD  changes , to evaluate  how effectively an OVD forms  a 
protective coating over the corneal endothelium .  
6 Study Objectives and Purpose  
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effect iveness of the Bausch & Lomb 
DVisc40  dispersive OVD compared to the Alcon VISCOAT® dispersive OVD when used in 
cataract surgery.  
6.1 Outcome Variables  
The following primary safety and effectiveness variables will be compared between the test 
and control groups.  
 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 57 
 6.1.1   Safety   
The primary safety variable will be the proportion of subjects who experience at least one 
IOP measurement ≥ 30 mmHg  at any post-surgical follow -up visit.  
  
6.1.2  Effectiveness    
The primary effectiveness variable will be  the change in ECD  from baseline t o Postoperative 
Visit 5 (90 Days ± 14 days) .   
7 Investigational plan  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  Description  
This will be a multicenter, controlled, randomized, monocular t rial of Bausch & Lomb 
DVisc40 (test)  OVD compared to the currently marketed Alcon VISCOAT® (control) OVD.  
Subjects scheduled to undergo cataract surgery by phacoemulsification and implantation of a 
posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) will be screened for eligibility. Subjects will be 
examined preoperatively to obtain a medical hist ory, to establish a baseline for ocular 
condition, including ECD , and to determine eligibility. Only one eye of each subject will be 
included in the study. In the event that both eyes are eligible to participate in the study, the 
selection of the study eye will be left to the Investigator’s discretion. At the time of s urgery, 
subjects will be randomly assigned to either of the OVD group s based upon a predetermined 
randomization scheme. Randomization will be by  a 1:1 schema ( DVisc40 :VISCOAT®) and 
will be stratified by site , age group and cataract severity.  A method other  than stratification 
may be employed to balance randomization. If so, the method will be specified in the 
statistical analysis plan  (SAP) . 
Postoperatively, subjects will undergo ophthalmic examinations at regular intervals per the 
study visit schedule  (refer to Appendix A). The Investigator will provide standardized pre -, 
intra-, and postoperative care for all study subjects at hi s/her site (refer to Se ction 11  for 
additional information). A delegated examiner at each site who is masked to the randomized 
assignment of each subject will perform all postoperative assessments.  
The VISCOAT®   OVD was chosen as the control because the product has been used in 
cataract surgery for over 20 years and has a proven record for safety.   In addition, 
VISCOAT® OVD  is classified as a dispersive OVD  as is the DVisc40 OVD.  
7.2 Investigators  
The clinical invest igation will be  conducted at up to approximately eighteen (18) 
investigative sites located in the US.  
The clinical investigation will be conducted by Investigators who are determined by the 
Sponsor to be suitably qualified by training and experience to co nduct this study in 
compliance with all applicable GCPs and Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) Federal 
Regulations or Local Regulations.  
In the event that selected sites do not meet full enrollment, the Sponsor may decide to 
increase enrollment as needed at other currently active sit es. No Investigator shall be 
expected to contribute less than 20 treated eyes or be allowed to  contribute more than the 
Study #877 Protocol

study.  
The study purpose, procedures, and subject responsibilities will be explained to the potential  
participant. The subject's willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be 
determined. When it has been established that the subject is willing to participate, written 
informed consent will be obtained  (Section 15.3). In order to determine subject’s eligibility, 
written informed consent must be obtained from each study subject prior to performing any 
study specific procedures whic h are NOT part of the Investigator’s routine standard of care

 • Voluntary withdrawal  
• Death  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Study terminated by Sponsor  
Prior to discontinuin g a subject, every effort should be made to contact the subject, schedule 
a final study visit, and obtain as much follow -up data as possible. Adverse events will be 
followed as described in Section 12.4.4 . Subject withdrawals will be documented clearly on 
the source document and applicable  CRF.  
Notification of subject withdrawals will be made to the Sponsor  or their designee  through the 
IRT system and confirmed by the CRO .  
Only subjects who are randomized but did not receive study treatment may be replaced. A 
new subject number will be assigned as long as the total number of treated subjects at the site 
does not exceed the m aximum percentage of the total treated eyes in the study  based on the 
number of active sites as outlined in Section 7.2. Subjects who are discontin ued from the 
study  following  treatment will not be replaced.  
Discontinued subjects should be followed outside of the study protocol according to the 
Investigator’s normal standard of care.  
8.3.5 Subjects Lost to Follow - up 
Subjects who do not return for scheduled Postoperative Visit (s) as defined by the visit 
window , and cannot be contacted, may be considered lost to follow -up. All follow -up 
attempts will be documented and kept with the subject’s source documentation, and the 
applicable CRFs will be compl eted.  
Efforts shall be made to keep the number of subjects lost to follow -up to below  10% of the 
number of subjects treated .   
9 Treatment  Plan 
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Up to approximately 368 subjects  (368 eyes) will  be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
DVisc40 (test) OVD or VISCOAT® (control) OV D during surgery.  
9.1.1 Treatment Allocation  
At the time of surgery, subjects will be randomly assigned to either the DVisc40 OVD group 
(test) or the VISCOAT® OVD group (control) based upon a predetermined randomization 
scheme. Randomization will be on a 1:1 schema.  
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 57 
 9.1.2 Randomization Method  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two OVD materials according to the 
randomization scheme to be provided  in a computer -generated randomization co de by a 
biostatistician otherwise not involved with the study .  
Interactive Response Technolog y (IRT) will be utilized for randomization in this study.  
Randomization will be stratified by site , age group and cataract severity . A method other than 
stratific ation may be employed to balance randomization. If so, the method will be specified 
in the  SAP. The randomization codes will be established in blocks such that approximately 
the same number of subjects will be assigned to the DVisc40 OVD or VISCOAT® OVD  
treatment groups  at each site .   
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1 
(DVisc40:VISCOAT®).  Each screened subject will be assigned a unique 5 -digit s ubject  
number assigned by the  site accessing the IRT system.  The subjec t number assigned by the 
IRT system  will consist of the 2 -digit investigational center/site number (pre -assigned by 
Sponsor or its designee) and the 3 -digit chronological screening order number starting with 
001 (e.g. 01 -001, 01 -002).  The study device kit  will be assigned to subjects based on a 
randomization code and the kit will be dispensed  to the subjects at Day 0 (Operative Visit)  by 
the IRT system.  The assigned kit number should be recorded in the subject’s source 
documents and applicable case report  form.  A study device log will document the inventory 
and dispensing of study device at each investigational center.  
9.1.3 Treatment Replacement  
No other OVD can be used intraoperatively in conjunction with either the test or control 
OVD.  Use of any other OVD will require immediate discontinuation of a subject from the 
study.   If the surgeon feels more than one vial of test or control OVD is required to complete 
the surgery, this will be allowed and the incidence of such events will be reported.  
9.2 Postoperative M asked Examiner s and Masked Roles  
Each site should have at least two  masked examiner s to perform the post -operative 
measurements .  It is preferred that the same masked examiner perform all post -operative 
measurements for an individual subject.    
 
Subjects,  masked examiner s, the specular microscopy  reading center  employees , the Sponsor 
(other than the assigned unmasked contact) and the CRO,  with the exception of the study 
monitors,  will be masked to the OVD treatment received.  
 
Masking of subjects during the  surgical procedure (and during the course of the study) will 
be discussed during a site initiation visit by the Sponsor representative with the Principal 
Investigator and study staff.  All surgical staff present during the cataract surgery (who are 
unmask ed) will be instructed not to discuss the OVD treatment assignment in the presence of 
the subject.  Intraoperative surgical staff present during the cataract surgery will further 
confirm their commitment to not disclosing the assigned OVD treatment assignm ent to a 
subject by signing a masking commitment form prior to the initiation of the cataract surgery. 
Documentation will be maintained in the site files.  
 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 57 
 9.3 Concomitant Medications  
9.3.1 Preoperative Medications  
Preoperatively, antibiotic drops, as well as non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) 
where applicable, will be administered according to the Investigator’s standard of practice. A 
complete list of the standard regimen of preoperative medications used at a participating clinical 
site will be provided  to the Sponsor or its designee prior to initiation of the study. Absolutely n o 
IOP-lowering medications may be used prophylactically.  
9.3.2 Intraoperative Medications  
The Investigator will use their standard surgical medications. A complete list of the standard  
regimen of  intraoperative  surgical medications used will be provided to  the Sponsor or its 
designee prior to initiation of the study. Absolutely no IOP -lowering medications may be used 
prophylactically.   If an IOP -lowering medication is used intraoperatively (e.g. , in the case of 
surgical complication), the medication must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and 
on the applicable case report form(s).  Use of an IOP lowering agent under these co nditions is not 
a reason for discontinuing a subject from the study.  However, such subjects are to be excluded 
from the Per -Protocol (PP) and Best Case analysis populations.  
9.3.3 Postoperative Medications  
Investigators will use their standard regimen of postop erative medications , which may include 
antibiotic, steroidal, and/or NSAID drops. A complete list of the standard postoperative 
medications used will be provided to the Sponsor or its designee prior to initiation of the study. 
Absolutely no IOP -lowering me dications may be used prophylactically.    
Subjects requiring the postoperative use of a lubricating agent are only allowed to use  
unpreserved artificial tear preparations.  
9.3.4 Management of Raised IOP  
Treatment for IOP < 30 mmHg  should be avoided if possible unless the Investigator considers it 
necessary for the safety and well -being of the subject. In the case of treatment of IOP < 30 
mmHg , a specific justification must be documented in the subject’s source records and on the 
case report form.  Use of an IOP lowering agent under these conditions is not a reason for 
discontinuing a subject from the study.   However, they are to be excluded from the Per Protocol 
(PP) and Best Case analysis population s. 
 
For any IOP measurement ≥ 30 mmHg  at a study visit (or as determined as medically necess ary 
by the Investigator), the Investigator should institute a treatment consisting of one  or a 
combination of the following option s:  
 
• Aqueous fluid release  through corneal incision ;  
• Topical eye drops (e .g., B-blocker, prosta mide, etc.);  
• Oral medication (e .g., acetalozamide) . 
 
An IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  at a study visit must be rechecked in approximately one (1) hour after the 
initial IOP measurement . 
  
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 57 
 In the event of an IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  or the use of an IOP lowering treatment, the Inves tigator 
should contact the Sponsor and its representative immediately.  
9.4 Protocol Deviation  Definition   
A protocol deviation is defined as any instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or 
unintentionally, the requirements of the study protocol.  In the  event of a protocol deviation, 
the investigator or designee must document the date of the occurrence along with an  
expla nation for the deviation  in the subject ’s source documentation and any other applicable 
study form(s) .  
An investigator shall notify th e sponsor and reviewing IRB/EC of any deviation from the 
protocol to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an emergency.  Such notice 
shall be given as soon as possible, but in no event later than 5 working days  after the 
emergency occurr ed.  
All other p rotocol deviations must be reported by the Investigator to the IRB/ EC per the IRB/EC 
policies .  Notification of such protoco l deviations should  also be made  to the Sponsor  and/or its 
designee  as soon as possible .   
10 Study Materials and Management  
In order to maintain product integrity and sterility, the investigational devices will be used as 
supplied in their original pouch and outer packaging. At each site, t he investigational device  
will be dispensed by an appropriately qualified unma sked member of the study staff assigned 
by the investigator to this task . 
10.1 Description of Test Article

glass syringe delivering 0.75 ml of highly purified, non -inflammatory medium molecular 
weight fraction of Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate and Sodium Hyalurona te.  VISCOAT® OVD 
contains Sodium Chondroitin Sulfate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Dibasic Sodium Phosphate 
Anhydrous and Sodium Chloride (with Water for Injection) with a pH of 6.8 – 7.2. 
10.3 Packaging and Labeling  
The study materials  will be packaged and labeled in a manner consistent with the study 
design.  
10.3.1   Labeling  
The test article labeling will include the following information  on the outer box :  
• study number ;  
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 57 
 • product identifier  
• lot number ;  
• kit number;  
• quantity of contents ; 
• statement to refer to the Directions for use (DFU );  
• caution statement: Caution: Investigational De vice. Limited by Federal Law 
to investigational use ;  
• Sponsor name and address ;  
• storage conditions ; and 
• expiration date . 
 
10.4 Storage of Study Device  
DVisc40 OVD and VISCOAT® OVD must  be stored at 2° to 8° C (35° to 46° F) and must be 
protect ed from freezing. Before use, the study material  must be allowed to reach room 
temperature (approximately 20 to 45 minutes).   
 
10.5 Directions  for Use and Administration  
The test and control OVDs will  be used acc ording to the manufacturer’s directions for use 
document .  
 
The test and control OVD devices  (DVisc40 and VISCOAT®, respect ively ) will be provided 
in 1.0 ml and 0.75 ml syringes, respectively.  
 
The OVD  material  should be carefully injected int o the anterior chamber using standard 
aseptic technique  and may be injected into the chamber prior to and/or following removal of 
the crystalline lens. Instillation of the solution at th ese point s is significant, in that a coating 
of OVD may protect the corneal endothelium from possible damage arising from surgical 
instrumentation  or procedures  during the cataract extraction surgery.  The OVD may also be 
used to coat the tips of surgical instrument s and/or an IOL prior to implantation. For 
example, the internal surfaces of an IOL inserter are typically filled and/or coated with the 
OVD to provide lubricity during IOL compression and delivery into the eye.  Additional 
OVD , of the same product,  may be  injected  into the anterior  chamber of the eye to fully 
maintain the chamber or replace any volume lost during the surgical procedure.  
 
At the end of the surgical procedure , it is recommended that the OVD material be removed 
from the eye as completely as practical by thoroughly irrigating and aspirating with a sterile 
irrigating solution.  
 
10.6 Study Device Accountability  
The Investigator will be responsible for keeping current and accurate records of the amount 
of study device received and dispensed, and its d isposition. The devices must be stored under 
the appropriate conditions in a secure area and are to be used only in subjects enrolled in the 
study, in accordance with the conditions specified in this protocol. During the course of the 
study, the Investigat or must maintain an inventory of all investigational devices  dispensed to 
a subject, including subject identifiers.  
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 57 
  
Accountability records will include:

Sponsor/Sponsor's representative will review and verify the Investigator's accountability 
records. Following verification, and as directed by the Sponsor, unused study devices must 
be returned  to the Sponsor, or with the Sponsor's permission, disposed of at the site in an 
appropriate manner. Used devices will be disposed of after use  as directed by the Sponsor  
and disposal will be recorded on the study Accountability Log.  
10.7 Other Materials  
Additi onal materials will include:  
• ETDRS light box and charts  (provided by Sponsor  if needed )

Refer to Appendix A for the schedule of visits and parameters and Appendix B for methods 
of clinical evaluation.  
11.1.1  Preoperative Visit: Days -60 to -1 
Following identification of a potential subject, the Investigator (or designee) will explain the 
purpose of the study, p rocedures, risks/benefits, and subject responsibilities to the potential 
subject. The subject’s willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements of the study 
will be determined. If the subject chooses to participate in the investigation, written informed 
consent will be obtained. The subject and the person obtaining written consent, will sign and 
date the IRB/EC approved ICF, at which point the subject is considered part of the study 
population. The original signed document will be retained in the  subject records, and a copy 
will be provided to the subject. In addition, the applicable privacy regulation requirements 
must be met.  
 
The subject identification number  will be assigned by the site accessin g IRT, which will 
consist of a 2 -digit site numb er (pre -assigned) and a 3 -digit chronological order screening 
number, ass igned by IRT and starting with 0 01 (e.g., 01 -001, 01-002; in t his example the site 
number is 01). That subject number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study. 
It wil l not be necessary for the surgical procedures to occur in subject number order.  
Informed consent must be obtained prior to the Investigator performing study specific 
procedures that are NOT his/her routine standard of care. After obtaining written inform ed 
consent, prospective subjects will be screened to determine whether they meet the entry 
criteria for the study. Demographic information, medical history, and current medication use 
will be collected. The preoperative clinical evaluation will be conducte d no more than 60 
days prior to surgery and will consist of a complete ophthalmic examination including 
specular microscopy of the central corneal endothelium  of the study eye to obtain a baseline 
central ECD .  
Refer to Appendix A for a schedule of visits and parameters.  
11.1.2  Operative Visit : Day 0  
Subjects will be reassessed to reconfirm eligibility. In addition, any chan ges in concomitant 
medications , additional medical history since the preoperative study visit,  or any adverse 
events ( AEs) will be recorded. If the subject is no longer eligible, he/she will be discontinued 
from the study. If the subject is eligible, the subject will be randomized via IRT, surgery will 
be performed and the Investigator will answer questions  on source documents  concerning the 
surgery  using the surgical procedure described in Appendix C. 
 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 57 
 Intraoperative surgical staff present during the cataract surgery will confirm their 
commitment to not mention the treatment assignment in the presence of a subject by signing 
a masking com mitment form prior to the initiation of the cataract surgery. Documentation 
will be maintained in the site files.  
11.1.3  Postoperative Visits (1 through 5): 6 Hours + 2 hours to 90 Days + 14 days 
postoperatively  
All treated subjects will be seen for five (5) post operative visits. Refer to Appendix A for 
assessments to be performed at these visits.  
11.1.4  Unscheduled  Visit (s) 
Additional visits may be scheduled, as nece ssary, to ensure the safety and well -being of 
subjects. In cases where the subject’s IOP is ≥ 30 mmHg , additional Unscheduled Visits may 
be scheduled as necessary to monitor the subject’s IOP  (see Section 11) . All additional 
exam ination s should be fully documented in the site source docu ments and on Unscheduled 
Visit CRFs, as appropriate. Visits intended to fulfill scheduled visit requirements that fall 
outside the designated scheduled visit range, are not Unscheduled Visits. In these ca ses, the 
visit data will be collected and transcribed to the appropriate scheduled visit CRF.  
 
If a subject is seen for multiple visits during a given visit timeframe, the data from the visit 
that is intended to meet the protocol requirements for the sche duled visit s hould be captured 
on the  corresponding  visit CRF. Where such a determination cannot be made, the first visit 
within the scheduled visit interval will be used for completion of the pro tocol required 
scheduled visit CRF. Data from any additional  visits within a scheduled visit interval will be 
captured on an Unscheduled Visit CRF.  
11.1.5  Missed Visit(s)  
If a subject misses any scheduled follow -up visit and cannot be seen prior to the start of the 
visit range for the next scheduled follow -up visit, the v isit is considered missed.  
11.2 Post-study Follow -up 
If a subject requires further follow -up upon discontinuation or completion of the study, the 
Investigator should schedule post -study follow -up visits, as necessary. Refer to Section 
12.4.6  for follow -up of AEs following study exit.  
11.3 Study Completion  
The Sponsor or its representative will notify the Investigator or the IRB/EC, as applicable, to 
inform them  that the study is complete.  
11.3.1  Early Study Termination  
If any subjects in the investigation have an IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  in the study eye at one (1) week 
or later, early termination of the study shall be considered.  
 
If during the study it becomes evident to the Sponsor that the study should be stopped 
prematurely, the study will be terminated and appropriate notification will be given to the 
Investigator(s), IRB/EC, and FDA or Local Health Authority, as applicable. The Sponsor or 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 57 
 its representative  will instruct the Investigators to stop enrolling and dispensing study 
materials/treatment and to arrange for study closeout procedures at each site.  
12 Safety  and Effectiveness  Variables  
12.1 Evaluation of Safety  
The primary safety  variable will be the proportion of subjects who experience at least one 
IOP measurement ≥ 3 0 mmHg  at any follow -up visit.   
Secondary safety variables will be : 
• Mean change from baseline in IOP at the six hour post -operative visit  
• Mean change from baseline  in IOP at the 24 hour post -operative visit  
The incidence and type of AEs reported by the subject or observed by the Investigator at 
each study visit will be collected from the time the subject signs the ICF until study exit.  
12.2 Evaluation of Effectiveness  
The primary effectiveness variable for a subject will be the change in ECD  from baseline to 
Postoperative Visit 5 (90 Days ± 14 days).   There are no secondary effectiveness endpoints.    
12.3 Risk Assessment  
All risks associated with the use of the DVisc40 dispersive OVD have been assessed and 
reduced to as low as reasonably practicable.  Bausch + Lomb believe that the level of 
residual risk for this product is acceptable in the clinical setting where ophthalm ic surgery is 
performed.  An increase in IOP can follow anterior segment surgery in which OVDs are 
utilized. It is a recognized  potential consequence of their use , is typically transient,  and 
should not significantly impair ocular function or the repair of  ocular tissues. A significant or 
prolonged increase in the IOP can cause pain or discomfort and result in permanent damage 
to the eye.3 To mitigate this risk, the Sponsor  schedul ed the first two post-surgical follow -up 
visits to assess IOP at 6 Hours ± 2 hours postoperatively and at 24 Hours ± 4 hours 
postoperatively. Also, IOP will be assessed at all follow -up visits.   Other potential adverse 
effects include postoperative reactions including inflammation (iritis, hypopyon, 
endophthalmitis), corneal edema and corneal decompensation.  Subjects will be assessed at 
all follow -up visits.  
12.4 Adverse Events  
Each subject eye treated mu st be examined for the presence/ absence of adverse events at all 
visits, whether scheduled or not.  If an adverse event occurs, the fi rst concern  will be the 
safety and welfare of the subject; treatment should be provided as appropriate for the event.  
Depending on the severity and attribution of the event to the investigational device, FDA 
regulations and GCP s determine how incidences o f safety events are to be recorded and/or 
reported during the study . 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 57 
 12.4.1  Adverse Events  Definitions  
For the purposes of this study, a dverse events include : ocular  adverse events (AE s) in the 
study eye  only; all ocular  and non-ocular serious adverse events (SAE s); adverse device 
effects (ADE s); and unanticipated adverse device effects (U ADE s).  AEs, SAEs , ADEs  and 
UADEs are  defined  as follows :  
 
• Adverse Event  (AE) :  any untoward medical occurrence , unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (includ ing abnormal laboratory findings)  in a 
subject , user  or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical 
device.  This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device, 
comparator or the procedures involved.  For users or other persons, this definition is 
restricted to events related to investigational medical devices.  
• Adverse Device Effect (ADE):  an adverse event related to the use of an 
investigational medical device.  This definition includes AEs resulting from  
insufficient or inadequate instructions for use; deployment, implantation, installation, 
or operation; or any malfunction of the investigational medical device.  This 
definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.  
• Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  is an AE that : 
• led to d eath;  
• led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in :  
- a life -threatening illness or injury ; or 
- a permanent impairment of a body structure or  a body  function (e.g., 
blindness) ; or 
- in-patient or prolonged  hospitalization ; or  
- medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function;  
• led to f etal dis tress, fetal death, or a congenital abnorm ality or birth defect.    
NOTE:  Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition, or a procedure required 
by the  protocol , without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious 
adverse event.  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE):  any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety or any -life threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a 
device, if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
Experience with  cataract surgery and the implantation of IOLs has shown that some adverse 
effects  can be associated with either the surgical procedure or the lens implanted. The 
following i s a non -inclusive list of anticipated ADEs which have the potential of being  
considered as SAEs should the circumstances meet the necessary SAE criteria : 
 
• Corneal stromal edema  
• Cystoid macular edema  
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 57 
 • Wound leak (positive Seidel)  
• Flat anterior chamber  
• Iris prolapse  
• Vitreous in anterior chamber  
• Vitreous to wound  
• Synechiae/ Fibrin in pupil  
• Iritis  
• Raised IOP requiring treatment  
• Retained lens material  
• Capsulorhexis tear  
• Posterior capsular rupture  
• Severe IOL optic tilt or decentration  
• IOL dislocation out of the capsular bag  
• Deposits on IOL  
• IOL opacities  
• Worsenin g of pre -existing macular edema or diabetic retinopathy  
 
The following i s a non -inclusive list of ADEs that are rare in incidence : 
• Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS)  
• Hyphema  
• Hypopyon  
• Choroidal detachment/hemorrhage  
• Thermal injury (i.e. phaco burn, corneal burn)  
• Endophthalmitis  
• Retinal detachment  
• Loss of BCDVA ≥ 10  Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart 
letters  
12.4.2  Identification and Collection  
Identification and collection of  adverse events  (i.e. AE, SAE , ADE  or UADE)  begins after 
informed consent has been obtained and documented. Standard sources for identifying AEs 
include:  
• Direct observation by the Investigator ;  
• Asking the study participant a non -specific question (e .g., “Have you had any 
problems since the last v isit?”) ;  
• Unsolicited volunteering of information by the study participant (e .g., 
“Doctor, I have had numerous headaches since I started using this lens.”) ; 
and/or   
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 57 
 • Laboratory or test results that meet protocol requirements for classification as 
an AE (e .g., IOP ≥  30 mmHg ).  
 
Ocular  AEs in the study eye  only, ADEs, all ocular and non -ocular SAE s, and UADEs 
observed or elicited by the Investigator, reported by the subject, or resulting from a test 
result, etc., occurring during the clinical investigation must be documented. During the study, 
the Investigator should treat the study subject as appropriate to ensure his/her safety and 
welfare. Refer to Section 12.4. 5 for additional information pertaining to ongoin g AEs at 
subject exit.  
 
Pre-existing conditions will not be considered as AEs/SAEs, but will be collected at the 
preoperative visit  as medical history . A worsening of a pre -existing condition, with the 
exception of cataract in the fellow eye, during the s tudy should be documented as an AE and 
evaluated accordingly.  
 
Hospitalization is a criterion for assessment of seriousness .  Hospitalizations for admission 
without a medical AE should be captured as a serious AE until the cause of hospitalization 
can be identified.  However , the following reports of hospitalization without a medical AE 
should not be considered either serious or an AE:  
 
• Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with worsening of the pre -existing condition (e .g., for 
work -up of persistent pretreatment lab abnormality) ;  
• Social admission ( e.g., subject has no place to sleep) ;  
• Administrative admission ( e.g., for yearly physical exam) ; and/or  
• Optional admission not associated with a precipitation medical AE ( e.g., for elective 
cosmetic surgery) .  
12.4.3  Evaluations  
When evaluating AEs, the Investigator must determine if the event is serious (refer to Section 
12.4. 1 for criteria), assess the severity of symptoms  and the relationship of the ev ent to the 
study device using the following guidelines:  
a. Severity  
- Mild : Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, requires no 
treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities .  
- Moderate : Subject awareness of a si gn or symptom which may be a low level of 
concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities, but can be relieved by 
simple therapeutic care .  
- Severe : A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and requires 
systemic therapy or other treatment .  
 
b. Relationship to Study Device  
- Related:   There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the 
study device.  Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 57 
 relationship  or association  between the study device and the AE.   Also referred to as 
an ADE . 
 
- Unrelated:   There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to 
the study device.  This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has no evidence to 
suggest either a causal  relationship or association to the study device  and  more likely 
or certain  an alternative etiology exists.  
12.4.4   Reporting

 12.4.4.1  On-Site SAE/ UADE  Reporting  
 
The site must  report any adverse event to the Sponsor and its representative in an expedited 
manner if it meets the criteria for a SAE or a UADE .  When reporting a SAE/ UADE  to the 
Sponsor  and it s representative , the site must  forward any supporting documents along with 
the completed UADE  Report Form to the Sponsor and its designee within 48 hours of  
becoming aware of such an event.   
 
The contact s for reporting SAEs/ UADEs are : 
 
 
Sites must also report UADEs  to the reviewing IRB per its established reporting procedures  
or within 10 working day s following awareness of the event ; whichever is shorter .  The site 
should also complete applicable CRFs  within three working days of event identification.   The 
Sponsor or their designee will report the UADE to the FDA within 10 working days after 
being first informed by the Investigator.    
 
Non-Device related  SAEs  should also be recorded  in the applicable CRF s and submitted to 
the IRB  per IRB policy . 
12.4.4.2  Off-Site UADE  Reporting  
When participating in multicenter clinical investigations, Principal Investigators may receive 
UADE reports  from other participating sites as applicable .  These are Sponsor reports of 
UADEs  which occurred at other sites for the same trial, or in different trials using the same 
test article, that met the criteria for reporting to a regulatory agency.  These should be 
reported to the reviewing IRB per their established reporting procedures  or within 10 
working days; whichever is shorter . 
12.4.4.3  Reporting Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance.  Device deficiencies incl ude 
malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling .  All d evice deficiencies  will be reported to 
the Sponsor  and its representatives  on a Device Deficiency Report  form . 
Investigators must  evaluate, record, and report via applicable forms any 
complaints /deficiencies , or malfunctions that could potentially lead to a  SAE during this trial  
to the Sponsor and its representative  without unjustified delay .  As required, such reports 
may be provided to the reviewing IRB per their established reporting procedure s and the 

Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 57 
 FDA by the Investigator.   Upon the Sponsor’s request, Investigators must supply any 
additional information related to the safety reporting of a particular event.  
The contact for reporting device deficiencies is:  
The Sponsor shall review all device deficiencies and determine and document in writing 
whether they could have led to a SAE.  In the event of a disa greement between the Sponsor 
and the Investigator(s), the Sponsor shall communicate both opinions to the reviewing IRB 
per their established reporting procedures and the FDA as  described in Tabl e 4. 
12.4.5  Adverse Events and Unanticipated  Adverse Device Effects  at Subject Exit  
Ongoing AEs  will be followed until resolution ; no further change in the condition is 
expected ; as dictated by standard  of care ; or up to 30 days post  final visit, whichever is 
shorter . Documentation in the CRF s of such follow -up is not required although subject care 
should continue as appropriate.  
Ongoing UADEs  will be followed by the Sponsor and its representative (s) and Investigator 
until their medical endpoints are determined or until no further change in the condition is 
expected.  
12.4.6  Pregnancy  
All female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective method of birth control 
during the course of the study, in a  manner such that risk of contraceptive failure is 
minimized.   Effective contraception is defined as stabilized on oral cont raceptive for at least 
3 months or use for 3 months of an  intrauterine device (IUD) , condom with spermicidal, 
diaphragm with spermicidal, implant, Nuvaring, injection, transdermal patch , and/ or 
abstinence.  Females on birth control pills must have taken the same type pill for at least 
three months prior to entering the study and must not change type during the study. Those 
who h ave not used birth control pills in the three months prior to being screened must  not 
begin or resume usage during that period prior to entering the study .  Abstinence is allowed 
as a birth control method.  
 
Before enrolling a female subject of childbearing  potential in this clinical trial, the 
investigator must review the following information about study participation:  
•  Informed consent requirements ; and  
•  Contraceptives in current use . 
 
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or 
designee and the subject must sign the informed consent before study enrollment.  
 
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential are subject to urine pregnancy 
testing during their study visits and should be  instructed to contact the investigator 
immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  

Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 57 
  
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study 
enrollment, the study product must be  withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy 
testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study product 
and must not be enrolled in the study.  
 
Subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued fro m the study and 
followed until completion of pregnancy. Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE.  
 
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO 
contact within 48 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnanc y. All confirmed 
pregnancies must be reported via confirmed facsimile or email transmission and must be 
submitted on a Pregnancy Report Form within 48 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the 
pregnancy.  
13 Statistics  
Additional details of the statistical analysis will be provided in the SAP, which will be 
prepared and approved prior to database lock.  
13.1 Study Endpoints  
The following endpoints will be compared between the test and control groups.  
13.1.1  Safety Endpoint s 
13.1.1.1  Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint will be the p roportion of subjects who experience at least one 
IOP measurement ≥ 30 mmHg  in the study eye at any follow -up visit.  This endpoint will be 
evaluated cumulatively over all post-operative follow -up visits.  
13.1.1.2  Secondary  Safety Endpoint s 
• Mean change from baseline in IOP at the six hour post -operative visit  
• Mean change from baseline in IOP at the 24 hour post -operative visit  
13.1.2  Effectiveness  Endpoint  
13.1.2.1  Primary Effectiveness  Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint will be c orneal ECD  loss (%)  from baseline to 
Postoperative Visit 5 (90 Days ± 14 days)  in the study eye .  
13.1.2.2  Secondary  Effectiveness  Endpoint s 
There are no secondary effectiveness endpoints.   
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 57 
 13.2 Hypotheses  
13.2.1  Primary Hypotheses  
13.2.1.1  Primary Safety Hypothesis  
For the primary safety hypothesis test, the incidence of IOP observations at or above 30 
mmHg  refers to the number of study eyes  experiencing one or more such events at any 
postoperative visit. Each subject will be classified as having experienced an IOP spike or not 
having experienced an IOP spike and will not be double counted. The safety null hypothesis 
(H0) is that the test incidence (π t) of IOP observations at or above 30 mmHg  minus the 
control incidence (π c) of IOP observations at or above 30 mmHg  is greater than or equal to 
the non-inferiority margin  (δ). The alternative hypothesis (H 1) is that the test incidence (π t) of 
IOP observations at or above 30 mmHg  minus the control incidence (π c) of IOP observations 
at or above 30 mmHg  is less than the non-inferiority margi n (δ). 
H0: πt - πc ≥ δ  
H1: πt - πc < δ 
13.2.1.2  Primary Effectiveness Hypothesis  
ECD  loss will be evaluated from baseline to postoperative visit 5 (90 Days ± 14 days)  in the 
study eye . The primary effectiveness null hypothesis (H 0) is that the mean within -eye perc ent 
ECD  loss with the investigational OVD (μ t) minus the mean within -eye percent ECD  loss 
with the control OVD (μ c) is greater than or equal to the non-inferiority margin  (δ). The 
alternative hypothesis (H 1) is that the mean within -eye percent ECD  loss with the 
investigational OVD (μ t) minus the mean within -eye percent ECD  loss with the control OVD 
(μc) is less than the non-inferiority margin  (δ). 
H0: μt - μc ≥ δ  
H1: μt - μc < δ 
13.2.2  Secondary Hypotheses  
The secondary null hypotheses will be eligible for rejection only if both of the primary 
endpoints are met.  As recommended in ICH E9, t he nominal alpha risk will be 0.025 for the 
one-sided secondary superiority hypothesis tests.  
The secondary hypotheses will be tested in two sequential families, with simu ltaneous testing 
of the hypotheses in the second family.  
1. Family 1: Secondary Effectiveness Hypotheses  
a. ECD loss superiority test  
2. Family 2: Secondary Safety Hypotheses  
a. IOP spike rate superiority test  
b. Mean change from baseline in IOP at 6 hours post -op superi ority test  
c. Mean change from baseline in IOP at 24 hours post -op superiority test  
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 57 
 The overall type I error for the secondary endpoint hypothesis tests in Family 2 above will be 
controlled by application of the Holm stepwise procedure . 
13.2.2.1  Secondary Safety Hypothese s 
13.2.2.1.1  IOP Spike Rate Superiority Test  
The secondary safety null hypothesis regarding the IOP spike rate is that the test incidence 
(πt) of IOP observations at or above 30 mmHg is greater than or equal to the  control 
incidence (π c) of IOP observations at or above 30 mmHg. The alternative hypothesis is that 
the test incidence is less than  the control incidence .  
H0: πt ≥ πc  
H1: πt < πc 
If the null hypothesis is rejected then superiority will be claimed for the test OVD in the rate 
of IOP spikes.  
13.2.2.1.2  Mean Change from Baseline in IOP Superiority Test s 
Regarding the mean change from baseline in IOP at the six-hour and 24 -hour post-op visits, 
the null hypothesis at each visit is that the mean  change from baseline IOP for the 
investigational OVD group is greater than or equal to the mean change from baseline IOP for 
the control group. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean change from baseline IOP for 
the investigational OVD group is less than the mean change f rom baseline IOP for the 
control group.  
H0: μt ≥ μc  
H1: μt < μc 
For each of the visits, if the null hypothesis is rejected the n superiority will be claimed for the 
test OVD in mean IOP.   
13.2.2.2  Secondary Effectiveness Hypothesis  
The secondary effectiveness null  hypothesis is that the  mean within -eye percent ECD loss 
with the investigational OVD (μ t) is greater than or equal to  the mean within -eye percent 
ECD loss with the control OVD (μ c). The alternative hypothesis is that the mean loss with the 
investigational  OVD is less than the mean loss with the control OVD . 
H0: μt ≥ μc  
H1: μt < μc 
If the null hypothesis is rejected then superiority will be claimed for the test OVD in ECD

 13.3 Sample Size Determination  
13.3.1 Incidence of IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  
Due to their comparable rheological  properties , DVisc40 and VISCOAT® OVD s are 
expected to demonstrate  similar  behavior during surgical procedures.  
In published studies using VISCO AT®, VISCOAT® performed without a nti-IOP 
prophylactic treatment where the frequency of IOP spikes ≥ 30 mmHg  after surgery ranged 
from 0.0% to 4 7.5%.6-23 Based on these studies   the control OVD incidence of subjects who 
experience  at least one IOP observation ≥ 30 mmHg  is estimated to be 0.117  (11.7%).A 
doubling of the control OVD in cidence would be problematic  and clinically significant , thus  
the non -inferiority margin will be defined as equal to the expected rate of  0.117  (11.7%). 
 
When the sample size in each group is 165 subjects , a two -group large -sample normal 
approximation test of proportions with a one -sided 0.050 significance level will have 95.17 % 
power to reject the null hypothesis that the test is inferior to the control (the difference in 
proportions, t - c, is 0.117  or greater ) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the test is 
non-inferior to the control (the difference in proportions , t - c, is less than 0.117 ), assuming 
that the exp ected difference in proportions is 0.0 00 and the proportion in the standard group 
is 0.117 .  
13.3.2 ECD  Loss  
The standard deviation of the ECD  loss percentage with VISCOAT® is estimated to be 
14.2% .24 When the sample size in each group is 165 subjects , a two group 0.050 one -sided t -
test will have 93.90% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test is inferior to the control 
(the diffe rence in means, t - c, is 5%  or greater ) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that 
the test is non -inferior to the control (the difference in means, t - c, is less than 5%) , 
assuming that the expected difference in means is 0 % and the com mon standard  deviation is 
14.2% .  
13.3.3 Overall Power and Adjustment for Dropouts  
Assuming independence of the primary endpoints, the overall power of the study will be  
95.17 % x 93.90% = 89.36 %.   
 
To allow for a dropout rate of up to 10%, a sample size of approximately ⌈165 /(1−0.1)⌉=
184 subjects per arm will be targeted for enrollment.  The total enrollment target therefore 
will be approximately 368 subjects.  
13.3.4 Detectable Effect Sizes for  the Secondary Hypothesis Tests  
The secondary effectiveness hypothes is will be tested only if both primary endpoint 
statistical tests are successful. If the primary endpoints are met and the secondary 
effectiveness hypothesis is met, then t he type I error rate for the t hree secondary safety 
hypothesis tests will be control led using the Holm stepwise procedure. Under this procedure, 
the smallest  of the three  raw p -value s will be compared to 0.025/3  or, equivalently, tripled 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 57 
 and compared to 0.0 25. Consequently, d etectable effect sizes  for one-sided tests with 80% 
power are pr esented based on an alpha risk of 0.008 . 
13.3.4.1 Secondary Safety Hypothesis Test s 
13.3.4.1.1  Incidence of IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  
A two-group  2 test with a 0.008  one-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect 
the difference between a test group proportion, 1, of 0.117  and a control group proportion, 
2, of 0.256  when the sample size in each group is 165. 
13.3.4.1.2 Mean Change from Baseline in IOP  
A sampl e size of 165 in each group will have 80% power to detect a difference in means of 
1.797  mm Hg assuming that the common standard deviation is 5.0 mm Hg using a two -group 
t-test with a 0.008 one -sided significance level.  
13.3.4.2 Secondary Effectiveness Hyp othesis Test : ECD Loss  
A sample size of 165 in each group will have 80% power to detect a difference in means of 
4.393 % assuming that the common standard deviation is 14.2 % using a two -group t -test 
with a 0.0 25 one-sided significance level.  
13.4 Analysis  Populations  
13.4.1 Intent -to-Treat Population  
The Intent -to-treat (ITT) Population will include all eyes that were randomized.  
13.4.2 Safety Population  
The Safety Popul ation will include all eyes that were exposed to either the test OVD  or the 
comparator OVD . Study eyes that discontinue prior to OVD exposure  will be excluded from 
the Safety Popul ation. 
13.4.3 Per Protocol Population  
The Per Protocol (PP) Population  will include all randomized eyes without major protocol 
deviations. Protocol deviations resulting  in exclusion from the PP Set are described in 
Section 13. 5.7. 
13.4.4 Best Case Population  
The Best Case Population  will include all Per Protocol eyes without intraoperative 
complications.  Intraoperative complications, as documented in the Day 0 Surgeon 
Questionnaire ( cf. Appendix C), will be reviewed in a masked fashion  by the Sponsor prior 
to database l ock to determine which PP population cases warrant exclusion from the Best 
Case Population .

 13.5 Statistical Analysis  
Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum. Summaries for categorical variables will include the  
tabulation of frequencies and percentages.  
 
13.5.1 Primary Safety Analys is  
IOP will be assessed in the study eye using Goldmann tonometry at each scheduled follow -
up visit and may be assessed at unscheduled visits.  
 
Subjects with IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  at any follow -up visit (IOP ≥ 30 mmHg at any follow -up 
visit, No IOP ≥ 30 mmHg at any follow -up visit) will be summarized using categorical 
summary statistics  for the Safety Population by actual treatment received  in a table . Missing 
data will not be impu ted for this summary table.    
Missing IOP values will be imputed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. 
Twenty imputed datasets will be produced using a seed of 1017144149 . The variables used in 
the imputation model will include IOP at baseline and at each of the scheduled postoperative 
visits. After missing data at scheduled visits has been imputed, unscheduled visit IOP values 
will be added to each imputed dataset.  
 
Within each imputed dataset , subjects will be classified as belonging to one of the following 
groups : 
 
• IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  at any follow -up visit  
• No IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  at any follow -up visit  
 
This classification will be based on experiencing at least one IOP measurement of 30 mmHg  
or more at any follow up visit over the entire course o f the study. Subjects experiencing one 
or more IOP spikes will be counted only once . 
 
The difference between test and control in the proportion of subjects with IOP ≥ 30 mmHg at 
any follow -up visit and the asymptotic standard error will be estimated separa tely for each 
imputation.  
 
An estimated difference between treatment groups and a two -sided asymptotic Wald 95% 
confidence interval around the difference will be constructed via combination of the 
proportion differences and standard errors from the imputat ions. If all the imputations result 
in the same estimated difference and confidence interval, then the results of a single 
imputation may be used.  
 
If the upper confidence limit (equivalent to a one -sided upper 95% confidence limit) is less 
than 0.117  (11.7%), then the null hypothesis of inferiority will be rejected in favor of the 
alternative hypothesis of non -inferiority. A p -value will also be provided for this one-sided 
hypothesis test.  
 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 57 
 The primary safety analysis will be repeated  using the Per Protocol Population  as a 
sensitivity analysis  with observed data only  (i.e. without imputation) .  
 
In addition to the primary analysis, sensitivity  analys es will include a best -case analysis, a 
worst -case analysis, and a complete case analys is (which will include only data from subjects 
who have IOP measurements at every scheduled follow -up visit).  
 
Poolability of results across centers will be assessed by performing a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test comparing the endpoint between the treatment groups stratified by center. The 
p-value for the Breslow -Day test for homogeneity of odds ratios across centers will be 
compared to a critical value of 0.15.  
 
The previous analyses will be completed  for the following two groups, separately , without 
the sen sitivity analyses and poolability test : 
 
• Subjects who rec eived IOP -reducing intervention ; and  
• Subjects who did not receive IOP -reducing intervention . 
 
 
13.5.2 Primary Effectiveness Analys is 
Specular microscopy of the central cornea will be completed preoperatively and at Visit 5 
(90 ± 14 days postop). Images will be evaluated by a masked reading center. If multiple cell 
densities  are obtained from the reading center for each eye visit, then the available counts 
will be averaged by eye and visit  (Preoperative, Visit 5) to produce a single value for each 
eye visit .  
 
If one or more ITT Population eyes has a missing  mean ECD  value either at the preoperative 
visit or at Visit 5 (including due to a missed visit or due to discontinuation), then the missing 
data will be imputed as follows. Prior to analysis, 25 imputations of missing mean densities  
will be produced using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method  and the variables investigator, 
treatment, preoperative value, and postoperative value .   
 
For each obser vation in the imputed datasets, t he ECD  loss in percent at Visit 5 will be 
calculated for each eye at each visit as follows : 
 
%100Density  Cell  ve PreoperatiDensity  Cell  5 Visit  - Density  Cell  ve Preoperati (%)  Loss  
 
 
The means and standard errors from the imputed datasets will be combined to produce a 
continuous variable summary of the ECD  (cells / mm2) at each visit (Preoperative, Visit 5) 
and the percent loss  at Visit 5  by randomized treatment  assignment for the I TT Population .  
 
Loss (%) will be modeled as a function of the fixed class variable s treatment  and 
investigat or, separately by imputation . The parameter estimates will be combined to produce 
a one-sided upper 95% confidence limit for the difference in percent loss between the test 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 57 
 and comparator  OVDs  and a  p-value for the  hypothesis test  for the I TT Population . If the 
upper confidence limit is less than 5%, then the null hypothesis of inferiority will be rejected 
in favor of the alternative hypothesis of non -inferiority . 
 
If there are no ITT Population eyes with missing ECD  data, then imputation will not be 
performed. Instead, the available data will be analyzed and summarized as described above.  
 
Sensitivity analyses of effectiveness will include a best -case analysis, a worst -case analysis, a 
tipping point analysis, and a complete case analysis (which will use only subjects who have 
cell density measurements at every scheduled visit) , and analysis using the PP Set . 
 
Poolability across centers will be evaluated by modeling Loss (%) as a function of the fixed 
class variables treatment and investigator including their interaction using the available data. 
Poolability will be assessed by comparing the p -value for the interaction to a critical value of 
0.15.  
 
13.5.3 Secondary Analys es 
If both primary endpoints are met, then four secondary superiority tests will be evaluated.  
The secondary hypotheses will be tested in two sequential families, with simultaneous testing 
of the hypotheses in the second family.  
 
1. Family 1: Secondary Effectiveness Hypotheses  
a. ECD loss superiority test  
2. Family 2: Secondary Safety Hypotheses  
a. IOP spike rate superiority test  
b. Mean change from baseline in IOP at 6 hours post -op superiority test  
c. Mean change from baseline in IOP at 24 hours post -op superiority test  
The null hypotheses in Family 2 above will be elig ible for rejection only if the primary 
endpoints and the Family 1 secondary endpoint are met. The overall type I error for the 
secondary endpoint hypothesis tests in Family 2 above will be controlled by application of 
the Holm stepwise procedure  as follows . 
 
1. The small est of the t hree raw p -values will be compared to 0.008 333 or, equivalently, 
tripled and compared to 0.0 25. If the raw p -value is less than or equal to 0.008 333, 
then the associated null hypothesis will be rejected. Equivalently, if three  times  the 
raw p -value is less than or equal to 0.0 25 then the associated null hypothesis will be 
rejected.  
2. The second smallest of the three raw p -values will be compared to 0.0125 or, 
equivalently, doubled  and compared to 0.0 25. If the raw p -value is less than or equal 
to 0.0125 , then the associated null hypothesis will be rejected. Equivalently, if two 
times the raw p -value is less than or equal to 0.0 25 then the associated null hypothesis 
will be rejected.  
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 57 
 3. The large st of the t hree raw p -values will be compared  to 0.0 25. If the p -value is less 
than or equal to 0.0 25 then the associated null hypothesis will be rejected.  
The null hypotheses will be rejected (or not rejected) based on the p -values and the Holm 
stepwise adjustment and not based on the confidence int ervals described below.  
13.5.3.1 Secondary Safety Analyse s 
13.5.3.1.1 Incidence of IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  
The null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups in the proportion of s ubjects 
with IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  at any follow -up visit  will be tested using a chi -square test  for the 
Safety set . A two -sided 95% confidence interval will be constructed around the difference 
between groups using the normal approximation.  If the null hypothesis is rejected then 
statistical superiority will be  claimed for the test OVD  in this endpoint . 
13.5.3.1.2 Mean Change from Baseline in IOP  
Change from baseline in IOP (mm Hg) will be computed as post -op IOP minus baseline IOP 
and will be summarized  using continuous summary statistics for the Safety Populat ion by 
scheduled Visit and actual treatment received in a table. A statistical model will be 
constructed by visit with change from baseline in  IOP as the dependent variable, treatment 
group , investigator,  as a fixed factor , baseline IOP as a continuous covariate, and subject as a 
random factor.   For each study visit (6 hours post -op and 24 hours post -op), superiority will 
be claimed for the test OVD in this endpoint  if the null hypothesis is rejected .    
13.5.3.2 Secondary Effectiveness  Analys is 
The null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups in ECD loss will be tested for 
the ITT set using the multiple imputation method and statistical model described above for 
the primary effectiveness analysis. A two -sided 95%  confidence interval will be constructed 
around the difference between groups . If the null hypothesis is rejected then statistical 
superiority will be claimed for the test OVD  in this endpoint . 
 
13.5.4 Surgery Data  
The surgery data described in Appendix C will be summarized descriptively.  Any planned 
analyses of surgery data wi ll be detailed in the study SAP.  
 
13.5.5  Patient Disposition  
Enrollment status will be summarized in a table by inve stigator and overall for the all 
enrolled set. The number and percentage of enrolled eyes will be summarized as well as the 
number and percentage of eyes that completed the entire trial, discontinued before surgery, 
and discontinued after surgery. In addit ion, for those eyes that did not complete the entire 
trial, the reason for discontinuation will be summarized.     
 
Subject accountability at each form visit will be summarized for all enrolled subjects in a 
table. The subject accountability table will als o be stratified by investigator and by treatment 
assignment.  
 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 57 
 Subject s in the Safety, ITT , and PP Populations will be summarized categorically by 
treatment and overall.  
13.5.6 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Race, gender, ethnicity, and age and will be presented using discrete summary statistics by 
treatment group. Age will also be presented using continuous summary statistics by treatment 
group.  
13.5.7 Protocol Deviations  
The number of subjects within each type of protocol deviation will be pres ented using 
discrete summary statistics.  
 
Major protocol  deviations  leading to exclusion from the PP Set  will include  the following.  
• Ineligib ility 
• Use of  an incorrect OVD  including misrandomized subjects  
• Disallowed concomitant treatments including IOP low ering treatments  
• Missing IOP value at postoperative visit 1 or 2  
Additional major protocol deviations may be identified prior to unmasking of the treatment 
assignments.  
13.6 Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned.  
13.7 Additional Statistical Considerations  
13.7.1 Handling of Missing Data  
Imputation of missing primary endpoint data is described in Section 13.3 above. Unless 
otherwise specif ied in the SAP , missing data will not be imputed.  
13.7.2 Multicenter Issues  
Randomization will be stratifi ed by site. Sites will be considered in the primary effectiveness 
analysis as described in Section 13.3 above.  Poolability will be assessed as described in 
Section 13.3 above.  
13.7.3 Multiplicity Issues  
Statistical success will require demonstration  of non -inferiority in both the primary safety 
and effectiveness endpoints for the primary analysis  populations. Therefore, no adjustments 
for multiplicity are required  for the primary hypothesis tests . The first secondary hypothesis 
test will be eligible for eva luation only if the primary endpoints are met. Therefore, no 
adjustment for multiplicity will be necessary. The secondary hypothesis tests in the last 
family of hypotheses will be adjusted for multiplicity using the Holm stepwise procedure.

 14 Quality Control  and Quality Assurance  
14.1 Study Monitoring  
The Sponsor and  its representatives must be allowed to visit all study site locations to assess 
the data, quality, and study integrity in a manner consistent with applicable health authority 
regulations and the procedures adopted by the Sponsor or its representative .  
 
Prior  to the start of the study, member(s) of the Sponsor  (or designees) will review the 
protocol, CRF, regulatory obligations, and other material or equipment relevant to the 
conduct of the study with the Investigator/Sub -Investigator and relevant study site p ersonnel  
via an Investigator Meeting and/or site initiation visit s.  
 
Monitoring visits and telephone consultations will occur as necessary, or per the monitoring 
plan, during the course of the investigation to verify the following:  
 
• The rights and well-being of subjects are protected ;  
• The conduct of the investigation is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment, 21CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, and 812, ISO 15798 (20 13(E) )

Practices , 42 USC 282(j) and IRB/ EC requirements ;  
• The integrity of the data, including adequate study documentation ;  
• The facilities remain acceptable ;  
• The Invest igator and site personnel remains qualified and able to conduct the study ; 
and  
• Test article accountability .  
 
During the course of the study, if the Sponsor determines that an Investigator is non -
compliant with the study plan and/or applicable regulatory requirements, the Sponsor will 
take action to secure compliance. In addition, the Sponsor may terminate the Investigator’s 
participation in the study if appropriate, or if the Investigator remains non -compliant despite 
the Sponsor’s actions.  
14.2 Source Documen tation  
All medical information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject’s record 
(source documentation) in real time as it is collected. Source documentation consists of 
original subject documents, as well as data and records with infor mation relevant to the 
subject and his/her participation in the study.  
 
Source documentation worksheets may be provided by the Sponsor or its designee to record 
pertinent information. The completed worksheets can then be incorporated into the subject’s 
medical chart. If it is preferred to not use the worksheets in the subject’s permanent record, 
then the worksheets should be used as a reference to determine the type of study data to 
record in the subject’s permanent record.

Should an  Investigator withdraw from the study ( e.g., retirement  or relocation), study records 
will be transferred to a mutually agreed up on designee ( e.g., another Investigator  or a site 
IRB/ EC). The Investigator will provide notice of such transfer in writing to the Sponsor 
and/or its representative . 
14.5 Audits and Inspections  
Audits of clinical research activities in accordance with the Sponsor’s internal Stan dard 
Operating Procedures  to evaluate  and assure  compliance with the principles of GCP may take 
place. A regulatory authority may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the study or 
after its completion). If an inspection is requ ested by a regulatory authority and/or IRB/ EC, 
the Investigator must inform the Sponsor and its representative immediately that this request 
has been made.  
15 Ethics and Administrative Issues  
It is the responsibility of the site’s principal investigator to as sure that all aspects of the ethics 
review are conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki as described in the 
International Council for  Harmonisation  (ICH) Guideline E6 for Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP). The protocol and any information suppli ed to the subject to obtain informed consent, 
including written informed consent form(s), subject recruitment procedures ( e.g., 
advertisements), and written information to be provided to subjects (information leaflets), 
will be reviewed and approved by a q ualified Institutional Review Board (IRB)  or an  Ethics 
Committee ( EC) prior to enrollment of participants in the study. Prior to initiation of the 
study, the Sponsor or its designee will receive documentation of the IRB/ EC approval, which 
specifically iden tifies the study/protocol, and a list of the IRB/ EC committee members. 
Protocol amendments will be reviewed and approved by the IRB/ EC prior to implementation 
of any changes made to the study design. Investigators submitted progress reports to the 
IRB/ EC in accordance with the IRB/ EC requirements.  
15.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study

 enrollment) and the ICF to be used in this study are approved by their institution IRB/ EC, or 
if not using their institution's IRB/ EC, approved by the reviewing central IRB/ EC prior to 
entering any subjects in the study. Documentation of IRB/ EC approval of the study protocol 
and informed consent must be provided to the Sponsor and its designee prior to initiation of 
the study. In addition, the Investigator must en sure that the reviewing IRB/ EC has provided 
approval for any protocol amendments prior to implementation. If the amendment 
necessitates a revision to the ICF, the Investigator should ensure the revised form is also 
submitted to and approved by the Sponsor or its designee and the IRB/ EC prior to 
implementation.  
15.3 Written Informed Consent  
Before entry into the study, the Investigator or an authorized membe r of the investigational 
staff will explain to potential subjects (or their legally acceptable representati ves) the aims, 
methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study, and any 
discomfort it may entail. The subject (or legally acceptable representative) will be given 
sufficient time to read the IC F and the opportunity to ask quest ions. After this explanation 
and before entry into the study, consent will be appropriately recorded by means of either the 
subject's or his legally acceptable representative's dated signature. After having obtained the 
consent, a copy of the signed and da ted ICF will be given to the subject.  
 
If the subject (or legally acceptable representative) is unable to read or write, an impartial 
witness will be present for the entire informed consent process (which included reading and 
explaining all written informa tion) and will  personally date and sign the IC F after the oral 
consent of the subject (or legally acceptable representative) is obtained.  
 
The ICF will be signed before the performance of any study -related activity.  
15.4 Financial Disclosure  
Original Financial Disclosure Form (FDF) completed, signed and  dated by the PI and sub-
investigators  and study personnel  listed on the Delegation of Authority Log will be collected 
by the Sponsor or its designee, as applicable, and file in the Trial Master File . A copy of the 
FDF will be retained in the Investigator Site Binder.  
15.5 Confidentiality/Publication of the Study  
All study data generated as a result of this study will be regarded as confidential, until 
appropriate analysis and review by the Sponsor or its desi gnee and the Investigator(s) are

 Appendix B: METHODS OF CLINICAL EVALUATIONS  
Any changes to the procedures described in this Appendix will be provided under separate 
cover.  
1.0 Visual Acuity  Testing Methods  
Best-corrected visual acuity at Baseline and all scheduled follow -up visits will be measured 
using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts at 4 meter s. 
The charts were designed according to the following principles described by Bailey and 
Lovie25 and the National Academy of Science -National Research Council (NAS -NRC)  
Committee on Vision 198026:  
• Letters of equal legibility;  
• Combine the letters so that each line is of approximately equal difficulty as described 
by Ferris et al27; 
• Present five letters at each acuity level;  
• Space rows by the height of the smaller letter;  
• Space letters by the width of same -sized letters; and  
• Use a logarithmic progression of letter size from LogMAR (Logarithm of Minimal 
Angle of Resolution) -0.3 (20/10) to 1.68 (20/957).   
This standard describes a single method for the measurement of visual acuity (which is 
strongly influenced by the methods used in the ETDRS and AREDS protocols) so that 
measurements obtained using the procedures listed belo w can be compared within and 
between sites. 27 
The subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 
at the top of the chart. The subjects should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers.  
If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no 
numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number.  The subje ct 
should be asked to read slowly, about one letter per second, so as to achieve the best 
identification of each letter.  He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given 
a definite response.  
A maximum effort should be made to identify ea ch letter on the chart.  When the subject says 
he/she cannot read a letter, the subject should be encouraged to guess.  If the subject 
identified two (2) letters (e.g., A or B) , the subject should be asked to choose one letter , and, 
if necessary, to guess. When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be  
made despite encouragement to read or guess, the examiner should stop the testing for that 
eye.  However, all letters on the last line should be attempted as l etter difficulties vary and 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 57 
 the last letter may be the only one read correctly.  The number of letters missed or read 
incorrectly should be noted.   
In order to provide standardized and well -controlled assessment of visual acuity, all visual 
acuity assessm ents for a subject should be performed consistently (e.g., the same lighting 
conditions, viewing distance, etc.) at each visit.  
Illumination of the ETDRS Chart and Examination Room  
The internal illumination of the ETDRS chart should be turned on. This wil l provide the 
nominal contrast for each of the charts. Room illumination should be turned off  to ensure that 
the illumination is consistent for each measurement. Ambient sources of light in the room 
should be kept at a minimum. The room lighting and any am bient sources should be 
consistent in their use and placement at each subject visit throughout the course of this study.  
Manifest Refraction  
Each subject must be manually refracted to his/her best correction by an ophthalmologist, 
optometrist, or a skilled  technician using the ETDRS chart at 4 meters with a phoropter or 
trial frames under photopic lighting conditions.  At no time during the study will 
autorefraction be utilized as a final end point refraction. Autorefractor or lensometer readings 
may only b e utilized to obtain a starting point for the refraction if necessary.  
All refractions will be conducted in a manner consistent with the site’s standard techniques 
using 0.25 D steps and utilizing a Jackson cross cylinder method.  Manifest refraction is 
adjusted for optical infinity by subtracting 0.25 D from the sphere of the manifest refraction 
obtained using the ETDRS chart at 4 meters.  The resulting refraction will then be placed in a 
trial frame and utilized to obtain BCVA results.  
Scoring Visual Acuity L ogMAR Tests  
The examiner records each letter identified correctly by circling the corresponding letter on 
the Visual Acuity Worksheet.  Letters read incorrectly or not read at all are not marked on the 
form.  Each letter read correctly is recorded as one.  The total letters read is recorded on the 
source documents. The LogMAR score will be calculated by the sponsor.  
During the course of the study, if the subject is unable to read any letters at 1 meter, they will 
be asked to count fingers at 0.5 met ers (1 foot and 7 ⅝ inches).  If fingers cannot be counted 
at 0.5 meters, the vision will be considered hand motion.  Hand motion will be determined at 
0.5 meters.  Light perception will be determined using an indirect ophthalmoscope.  
The ETDRS chart must be placed at a distance of 4.00 meters (13 feet and 1.5 inches, or 
157.5 inches) from cornea to chart surface, when using a 4 -meter chart.  For testing at 1 
meter, the distance must be 1.00 (39 and 3/8 inches). A measuring tape or meter stick should 
always  be available to verify the chart distance, even if the examining chair is supposed to be 
immovable or if reference marks are placed on the floor or walls.  
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 57 
 The 1 -meter distance is measured from the eye of the participant, seated comfortably in a 
chair wit h his/her back firmly placed against the chair, to the center of the 2nd or 4th letter of 
the 3rd line of the chart. The measuring device can be home -made (e.g., a dowel rod 
accurately cut to a length of 1.00 m) or 1 -meter ruler may be purchased.  
If it is necessary to refract at the 1 -meter distance, remember to add +0.75 sphere to the trial 
frame. Subtract the +0.75 sphere from the final refraction obtained at the 1 -meter distance 
before recording the refraction.  
2.0  SLIT LAMP EXAMINATION  
Slit lamp examination will be performed using a slit lamp biomicroscope and observations 
graded per the following classification s of slit lamp observations:  
Cataract Type  (pre-operative)  
• Nuclear  
• Cortical  
• Posterior sub -capsular  
• Combination  
Cataract Density  (pre-operative)  
• 1+ = Slight  
• 2+ = Moderate  
• 3+ = Dense  
• 4+ = Very dense * 
* Very dense cataract excludes subject from study  
Central Corneal Stromal Edema  (pre-operative and post -operative)  
• None – No evidence of central corneal stroma l swelling with normal transparency  
• Mild – Mild central corneal stroma l swelling  
• Moderate – Moderate central corneal stroma l swelling  
• Severe – Definite widespread cloudiness or haziness giving dull ground glass 
appearance to cornea, or numerous coalescent  bullae  
Corneal Wound Edema  (post -operative only)  
• None – No evidence of corneal wound swelling with normal transparency  
• Mild – Mild corneal wound swelling  
• Moderate – Moderate corneal wound swelling  
• Severe – Definite widespread cloudiness or haziness giving dull ground glass 
appearance to cornea, or numerous coalescent bullae  
 
The slit lamp examination includes the measurement of aqueous cell and flare by the 
Standardization of Uveitis Nomencla ture ( SUN) Working Group  grading system .5  For the 
evaluation of cells and flare, using  a 1 mm x 1 mm slit beam , the following SUN grading  
scheme  must be  used:

3.0  ECD   
 
Specular microscopes that will be u sed in the study must first be certified by the  central 
reading center prior to its use for study purposes.  At least two study staff member s that will  
be obtaining ECD images and u sing the specular microscope as delegated by the PI must be 
trained and  certified by the central reading center to ensure proper and consistent imaging 
prior to  capturing study subject images .  Documentation of such training a nd qualifications 
will be maintained in the site files.   The ECD technicians should be d elegated as a primary or 
back -up technician with the primary ECD technician obtaining ECD images whenever 
possible and the back -up technician obtaining ECD images as ne cessary  in lieu of the 
primary technician . 
 
Clinical sites are to use their specular microscopes in accordance with the manufacturer’s and 
reading center’s recommendations and procedures.   Calibration of specular microscopes will 
be documented and filed at  each clinical site . 
 
Standardized ECD  count metho ds28 will be used to minimize variability. The measurement of 
the ECD  in the central cornea will be performed preoperatively and at three months 
postoperatively (Visit 5) at all sites using a non -contact  Specular Microscope (approved by or 
supplied by the Sponsor) . Three images from the central  part of the cornea will be ob tained 
for each applicable subject visit.   
 
Initial eligibility determination by the sites is not dependent on receiving reading center ECD  
results.   However, subjects with automated counts below an average of 1750 cells/mm2 must 
await confirmation of >150 0 cells/mm2 from the reading center  prior to enrolling the subject.  
 
Study #877 Protocol   
DVisc40 03JAN2019 V6.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 of 57 
 To determine ECD , sites will submit all preoperative and three month postoperative images 
to the reading center (wh ich will be masked) for image analysis.   The reading center will 
determi ne the mean ECD based on the three images.  
 
4.0  INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (IOP ) 
 
IOP measurements must be obtained using a calibrated Goldmann Type Applanation 
Tonometer in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.   Calibration of the Goldmann 
Tonometer is required to be done at least monthly and the results recorded in a calibration  log 
for the device . 
 
5.0  DILATED FUNDUS EXAM  
 
Using an Ophthalmoscope, light is shone into the eye and the retina and the optic nerve  are 
examined. This exam is used to evaluate the internal structures of the eye. The Investigator 
will classify the fundus as “normal” or “abnormal.”  
 
6.0  ULTRASOUND PACHYMETRY  
 
Corneal pachym etry will be performed using an  ultrasound pachymeter available at a clinical  
site. Measurements of corneal pachymetry are to be taken three (3) times at each study visit 
at which pachymetry is required, and the data for all 3 measurements will be entered in the 
study database.  A mean for the 3 measurements will be calculated by the database system  to 
the nearest micron.   The measurement s should be obtained using the standard procedure of 
the site, and by an ophthalmologist, optometrist, or ophthalmic technician, who has been 
certified for use of or appropriately trained on an  ultrasound pachymeter. It is essential the 
site use the same procedure  and device  for all subjects and visits.

 Appendix C: SURGICAL PROCEDURE  
All cataract surgical procedures will be performed by the same surgeon  at a site, using a 
phacoemulsification system adjusted according to the surgeon's usual settings (power 
modulation should be used).   In the event a different surgeon (sub -investigator) will be 
performing the surgical procedures, the site must request in writing sponsor ’s approval  prior 
to surgery.  
Intraoperative surgical staff present during the cataract surgery will confirm their 
commitment to not mention the treatment assignment in the  presence of a subject by signing 
a masking commitment form prior to the initiation of the cataract surgery. This 
documentation will be maintained in the site files.  
  
The surgical procedure will be performed as follows:  
 
• The IRT system will be accessed  as described in Section 9.1.2 of the protocol to identify 
the OVD treatment to be randomly assigned to the subject.   The appropriate OVD 
treatment will be prepared for surgery according to the relevant DFU and made available 
to the Investigator.  
• The eye w ill be prepared for surgery and draped according to the surgeon's standard 
procedure.  
• The surgery will be performed under topical anesthesia (surgeons may use their 
discretion to augment with additional anesthesia).  
• Adequate dilation will be obtained.  
• The main incision will be made using a 1.6 – 2.8 mm keratome. This incision will be 
used as the main incision for the IOL implantation.  
• The test or control OVD will be used to fill the anterior chamber.  
• The continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis will be per formed using surgeon’s medical 
judgment and standard of care . The phacoemulsification equipment will be adjusted 
according to the surgeon’s usual settings (power modulation should be used).  
• Before IOL implantation, the anterior chamber and the capsular bag will be expanded 
with the test or control OVD. When the lens is in the proper position, the OVD must be 
completely removed.  
• The incision should be checked for leaks at the end of the proce dure. Wound closure 
should be sutureless, however, when indicated, may be sutured  or glued  at the discretion 
of the surgeon.  
• Following completion of the surgery, steroid, antibiotic, and/or NSAID drops, as per the 
surgeon’s standard regimen, should be app lied to the eye. A patch, or shield, dressing 
may be used at the discretion of the surgeon, if this represents their standard post -
operative regimen. Additional medications (except IOP lowering drugs) as deemed 
necessary, may be used at the surgeon's discr etion.  
• The Investigator immediately at the end of each  surgery will answer the following 
questions  in writing on a subject -specific source document :  
➢ IOL manufacturer  
➢ IOL model  
➢ Start time of surgery (first incision)  
Study #877 Protocol

 ➢ End time of surgery (wound closure)  
➢ Absolute phaco time (APT) in sec  
➢ Effective phaco time (EPT) in sec  
➢ Phaco system  manufacturer   
➢ Use of venturi or peristaltic pump  
➢ Flow rat e (mL/min)  for OVD removal with irrigation and aspiration (I/A)  
➢ Vacuum level (mmHg)  for OVD removal with I/A  
➢ Total I/A time to remove OVD (post IOL implantation) in 
minutes:seconds:hundredth -of-seconds  
➢ Incision location: cornea, limbus, sclera  
➢ Incision size (mm)  
➢ Estimated total volume of OVD used ( approximate percent usage  per syringe  - e.g., 
75%, 50% ) 
➢ Any intraoperative c omplications or deviations from usual surgical routine.  Answers 
are to be Yes or No for the following : 
 Any device malfunctions, device use errors , or difficulty with device use  (Note: 
Device deficiencies will be reported on a Device Deficiency  Report  form  to the 
Sponsor  and its representative ; the original form will be stored with the site files)   
 Did the surgery need to be aborted for any reason  
 Achieve ment  and maintenance  of adequate pupil dilation  
 Complete removal of  all lens material, including cortex  
 Removal of  all viscoelastic from an terior chamber and capsular bag  
 Detect ion of  any capsular tear , zonular tear or vitreous loss  
 If a suture was placed to seal the corneal incision  
 Use of your standard of care  surgical medications without any prophylacti c IOP-
lowering treatments

 Précis 
 
This is a novel randomized crossover , double -blinded pilot study that aims to investigate 
the effects of different omega- 3 fatty acids, namely EPA and DHA, on lipoprotein 
metabolism.  Subjects will be unblinded for performance of measurements after they complete 
the study.  Subjects will receive EPA or DHA supplements for approximately 6 weeks with a wash out period of 8 weeks between the two arms of the study. The study consists of 4 outpatient visits when laboratory or research samples and CAVI tests will be performed. A 7 -
day food diary, pill count, and r ed cell membrane n -3 levels will be monitored to assess 
compliance.  
 Serum cholesterol is transported by lipoproteins, s uch as VLDL, LDL and HDL, which 
vary in their relationship to cardiovascular risk.  LDL is proatherogenic, whereas HDL is cardio -protective .  Fish oil supplementation, such as EPA and DHA, has been shown to 
reduce triglycerides. EPA supplementation has also been shown to lower LDL -C, whereas 
DHA can raise both LDL -C and HDL -C. These differential effects on lipoproteins may alter 
the cardiovascular protection afforded by fish oil supplementation. This study will test the 
hypothesis that EPA and DHA may diffe r in their LDL -C lowering ability because of 
differences in how they modulate plasma PCSK9 levels, which is a major determinant of LDL -C levels.  In addition, we will assess other parameters related to lipoprotein composition 
and function that may impact t he cardioprotective effect of EPA and DHA. Other reported 
beneficial effects of omega -3 fatty acid  supplementation, such as decreased platelet 
coaguability, markers of inflammation  and changes in gut microbiota , will also be monitored.

 1. Objectives  
 
The overall objective is to e lucidate the differential changes that EPA - and DHA- rich oils 
induce on lipoproteins and lipoprotein metabolism. In particular, we will focus on the effect of EPA and DHA on plasma levels of   PCSK9 as well as   LDL -C levels.   This will be first 
accomplished by performing a  small pilot study to assist in the design of a potential future 
larger clinical trial.    
2. Introd uction  
 A 2007 survey done by the National Center for Health Statistics and NCCAM on the use 
of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in US determined that omega -3 fish oil 
supplements were the most commonly used non- vitamin/non- mineral natural product 
consumed by adults, and the second most commonly consumed supplement  by children
1. 
Among the proportion of survey participants who had used natural products in the last 30 
days, 37% of adults and 31% of children had taken an omega -3 supplement for health reasons. 
Increasing evidence has indicated multiple health benefit of fish oil intake, including its ability to prevent heart disease, inflammation, dyslipidemia and diabetes via multiple 
mechanisms
2. The beneficial e ffects of fish oils appear to be due to long -chain omega -3 fatty 
acids, namely eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are 
similar in structure but different in their carbon backbone length and degree of unsaturation. EPA has 20 c arbon atoms and 5 double bonds (20:5), whereas DHA has a longer chain of 22 
carbon atoms and 6 double bonds (22:6). Their precursors, shorter -chain omega -3 fatty acids, 
primarily alpha -linolenic acid (18:3), are abundant in the diet, but only a very small percent  of 
these fatty acids are converted to the longer chain EPA and even less to DHA (Fig. 1)
3. The 
interconversion of DHA and EPA is also a very inefficient process, thus plasma levels of EPA and DHA are primarily derived from dietary sources, such as fish.

The intake of total omega -3 fatty acids in the United States is relatively low at ~1.6 g/d 
(~0.7% of energy intake). Of this, alpha -linolenic  acid accounts f or ~1.4 g/d, and only 0.1 to 
0.2 g/d comes from EPA and DHA4. A variety of governmental, scientific, and international 
organizations have established recommended target or minimum consumption levels of fish 
and omega -3 fatty acids. For long- chain omega -3 fatty acids, most guidelines are for 
combined EPA+DHA and are based on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the general population
5-8. Generally, these  dietary  guidelines converge on a recommended 
minimum consumption of 250–500 mg/d of c ombined EPA+DHA, and even higher doses for 
the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. For example, American Heart Association (AHA) recommends ~1 g/d of combined EPA+DHA for patients with documented CHD, and 2-4 g/d of combined EPA+DHA for patient s with elevated triglycerides. However, most 
guidelines do not make separate specific recommendations about EPA versus DHA consumption.  
Fish oils can substantially vary in the amounts and ratios of EPA and DHA that they 
contain.  For example, tuna oil nat urally contains more DHA than EPA (Table 1). In contrast, 
blue-fin fish, such as anchovy and sardine, contain more EPA than DHA. Since most 
commercial fish oil/omega -3 supplements are generally purified and concentrated from 
different marine sources, which  have different EPA to DHA ratios, widely different ranges of 
EPA/DHA are commercially available, but most typically range between 0.7 to 1.4 (Table 2).

The mechanisms involved in the shared and different physiological effect s between EPA 
and DHA are not fully understood9. For example, EPA and DHA have shared and distinct 
effects on nuclear receptors and transcription factors, metabolites, and lipid membrane function (Fig. 2). In general, long- chain omega -3 fatty acids are natu ral ligands of several 
nuclear receptors that regulate gene expression, including PPAR, hepatic nuclear factor, liver X receptors, and retinoid X receptors.  They also alter expression of transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element binding -protein and carbohydrate response element binding-
protein (ChREBP)
10, which may contribute to the physiologic effects of omega -3 fatty acids, 
e.g., on lipid metabolism and inflammation. EPA, however, is a more potent agonist of PPAR -
alpha than DHA, whereas DH A appears to more strongly regulate Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 
4-alpha (HNF -4-alpha), Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), and ChREBP11. Both EPA and 
DHA also give rise to resolvins, a newly described class of specialized pro -resolving mediator

 (SPM) that prote cts against prolonged inflammation and tissue injury in several animal 
models, including peritonitis and ischemia -reperfusion12. However, only DHA is metabolized 
to other classes of SPM, such as neuroprotectin -D1 and maresins, which may confer the 
unique i nflammation -resolving properties of DHA13,14. In animal models, neuroprotectin- D1 
promotes neuronal cell survival and may contribute to protective effects of DHA against 
ischemic stroke15. In addition, although both EPA and DHA alter lipid membrane propert ies, 
DHA appears to be especially effective in altering lipid membrane structure and function due 
to its longer hydrocarbon chain length and higher degree of unsaturation16. For example, in rat 
aortic endothelial cells, DHA incorporation increased membrane  fluidity more so than EPA17. 
In cultured mouse lymphocytes, DHA but not EPA modified the distribution and size of lipid rafts, specialized lipid domains in cellular membranes with major regulatory roles on protein 
function and signaling events
18.  
 
Fig. 2 Differences between EPA and DHA at molecular levels  
 
 
 Several investigations have evaluated the combined and separate effects of EPA and DHA 
supplementation on both TG -lowering and LDL -C raising. In a meta -analysis of 21 studies, it 
was concluded that b oth EPA and DHA decreased triglyceride levels, primarily by promoting 
fatty-acid catabolism via peroxisomal beta -oxidation, and also by inhibiting lipogenesis in the 
liver, and accelerating clearance of TG from the plasma
19,20. However, subjects treated wi th 
DHA, but not EPA, showed increases  in LDL -C, as well as in  HDL -C (Fig. 3) 21-25. Mori et al. 
reported that 4 g of purified DHA, but not EPA, increased LDL particle size in mildly 
hyperlipidemic men. Furthermore, EPA and DHA had a  different influence on HDL size 
subfractions23.  The mechanism for the differential effect of EPA and DHA on LDL -C and 
other lipoprotein changes is not fully understood nor whether these differences in lipoprotein 
metabolism relate to cardiovascular disease.

Recently, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a plasma protein 
produced in the liver and the intestine, has been identified as a major determinant of LDL -C 
levels and is now a promising therapeutic target  26,27.  PCSK9 binds to the  extracellular 
domain of the hepatic LDL -receptor causing its internalization and degradation, which leads 
to increased plasma levels of LDL -C.  New LDL -C lowering therapies are being developed 
using monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 to interfere with this process28.  We recently 
observed in apoE -knockout mice on a high fat diet treated for 13- weeks with the human 
equivalent to 4g/day of omega -3 fatty acids with an EPA:DHA ratio -1.5, a significant 
decrease in LDL -C and VLDL -C compared to untreated apoE -knockout mice on the same diet 
(Fig. 3A).  Both hepatic mRNA levels of PCSK9 and plasma PCSK9 protein levels were significantly decreased in mice receiving the omega -3 fatty acid supplement  (Fig. 3B) , which 
could possibly account for the observed beneficial changes in the serum lipoproteins.

  In this clinical trial, we plan to examine the effect of omega- 3 fatty acid supplements 
enriched in either EPA of DHA on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. In particular, we will

 examine their effect of LDL -C and LDL subfraction distribution and whether the se 
differences can be attributed to changes in plasma PCSK9 levels.  In addition, we will perform 
a detailed composition and functional analysis of lipoproteins on subjects treated with the EPA versus DHA enriched fish oil supplements. Given the widespread use of fish oils in the 
general population and the recent concern about their possible lack of effectiveness for 
cardiovascular disease protection
29,30, a more detailed understanding on their effect on 
lipoprotein metabolism is needed.   This may ultimate ly lead to new insights into the optimum 
ratio of omega -3 fatty acids  to use in fish oil  supplement s for cardiovascular health protection .   
 
3. Study Design and Methods  
3.1 Overview  
The study will be a prospective double -blind ed randomized crossover study (Fig. 4) . 
During the first visit, subjects will be screened by  an exclusion/inclusion questionnaire and 
baseline clinical laboratory testing.  If not excluded, they may also be assessed for vascular compliance by C ardio -ankle vascular index  (CAVI) testing
31,32  and the nutritionist will obtain 
a 7-day food diary. Eligible subjects will be randomized  by the NIH pharmacist  to take either 
EPA - or DHA- rich fish oil capsules equivalent to 3g of EPA or DHA  for 6 ± 1 week  in the 
first arm of the study and will return for a follow up . After a wash -out period of 8 ± 2 weeks , 
after a 3rd visit, they will receive the other fish oil supplement for 6 ± 1 week  in the second 
arm of the study. During the fourth and final visit, at the end of the second arm, they will repeat clinical laboratory and may repeat CAVI testing. The participant compliance will be monitored by a seven- day food diary questionnaire, and pill counts at each return visit.  In 
addition, fatty acid composition of red blood cells will be assessed by GC analysis
33.  Subjects 
may be contacted by phone or email at least  once  during each period to monitor compliance 
and any adverse events.  Subjects should also consent to be contacted for a future study. After 
completion of the second arm, results will be unblinded for each patient.

3.2  Visits 
There will be 4 visits for this study.  The return visits can be delayed or anticipated up to 
two weeks, if there are scheduling problems.  The first study day will be the screening and 
baseline followed by three additional visits coinciding with study landmarks. The study will 
be discussed in detail with interested subjects.  Any procedures needed to assess eligibility 
(i.e. blood laboratory tests, pregnancy test) will be performed after obtaining informed 
consent. Prior to the first visit a telephone call may be used to give general information about 
the study, to explain the exclusion/inclusion criteria and the tests that will be performed. This 
will not be considered a screening. In addition, phone calls may be used during the study to 
clarify any questions and to support compliance to the study. Any adverse event will be 
collected and repo rted as per item 12  of this proposal.  
Visit 1: At  the first visit (screening and baseline), the subjects will be consented and will 
be screened by an exclusion/inclusion questionnaire , baseline  laboratory tests and a pregnancy 
test for female s. In addition, 10 mL of blood and a stool sample  (optional)  will be stored for 
research tests. The subject will have vital signs and Body Mass Index measured, and will undergo a history and physical examination. If not excluded, they will receive a  diet and 
exercise assessment to determine their nutritional status , a physical examination  and a Cardio -
Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) test may be performed. Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects 
will be randomized by the NIH pharmacist , will receive a 6-week  (or up to 7 weeks, if 
necessary)  supply of the first dietary supplement (DHA or EPA) , will be instructed to take 4 
tablets, 3 times a day, after meals, for 6 weeks  (12 tablets a day)  and will be schedule d to 
return for a second visit.  
Re-screening Visit as applicable:   Repeat laboratory values, including baseline research 
blood, may be needed to reassess eligibility within 40 days of a screening failure.  If a subject

11 
 is found ineligible, during or after the first visit, the 10 mL of research blood will be  
discarded .  
Visit 2:  Six  weeks after the first visit (+/ - 1 week) the subject will return for their second 
visit.  They  will receive laboratory tests and a pregnancy test for female. In addition, 10 mL of 
blood and a stool sample  (optional) will be stored for research tests. The subject will have 
vital signs and Body Mass Index measured, will undergo a brief physical examination, receive 
a diet and exercise assessment to determine their nutritional status, and a Cardio -Ankle 
Vascular Index (CAVI) test may be performed.   A pill count will also be performed to 
evaluate compliance. At the end of the 2nd visit, the subjects will be instructed to discontinue 
supplementation for 8 weeks.    
Visit 3:  The third visit will occur 1 4 weeks (+/ - 1 week) after starting supplementation.  
At this visit, the subject s will receive laboratory tests and a pregnancy test for female. In 
addition, 10 mL of blood  and a stool sample (optional)  will be stored for research tests. The 
subject will have vital signs and Body Mass Index measured, will undergo a brief physical 
examination, may receive a diet and exercise assessment to determine their nutritional status, and a Cardio -Ankle Vascular Ind ex (CAVI) test may be performed.   At the end of the 3
rd visit, 
subjects will receive a 6 week supply  (or up to 7 weeks, if necessary)  of the second dietary 
supplement (EPA or DHA) and will be instructed to take 4 tablets, 3 times a day, after meals, 
for 6 weeks (12 tablets a day).  
Visit 4:  The fourth, and final, visit will occur 6 weeks (+/ - 1 week) after starting  the 
second supplementation.  At this visit, the subject s will receive laboratory tests and a 
pregnancy test for female. In addition, 10 mL of blood and a stool sample  (optional) will be 
stored for research tests. The subject will have vital signs and Body Mass Index measured , 
will undergo a brief physical examination, may receive a diet and exercise assessment to 
determine their nutritional status, and a Cardio- Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) test may be 
performed. A pill count will also be performed to evaluate compliance. At the end of the 4th 
visit, the subjects will be instructed to discontinue supplementation.     
Subjects will be encouraged to complete the seven day food record prior to the return  
visits, in order to facilitate the nutritional and exercise assessment.  However, if the subject 
does not complete, or only partially completed the seven day food record, the nutritional and 
exercise assessment will still take place and it will determine any changes in life- style.  
The supplement may be dispensed in full or in 2 different prescriptions.

minimum  255 mg of EPA  and 110 mg of DHA from fish oils  (EPA to DHA ratio: 2.3). E ach 
capsule of DHA- rich fish oil contains at minimum  274 mg of DHA and 74 mg of EPA from 
fish oils  (EPA to DHA ratio: 0. 27). The participants will be instructed  to take study drug 
containing approximately either 3g  per day  of EPA or  3g per day of  DHA  in three divided 
doses  (4 capsules, 3 times a day after meals) . With each regimen, the total dosage of EPA plus 
DHA will be approximately 4g per day. The dosing is comparable  with  earlier clinical trials21-
25. They will also be advised to take the supplements provided immediately after meals,  as 
they are better absorbed with fat .

 Drug Interactions:  Clinical studies have not been done to thoroughly examine the effect 
of EPA - or DHA- rich fish oil supplement  with anticoagulants. Patients receiving these fish oil 
supplements  and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation should be monitored 
periodically (e.g., aspirin, NSAIDS, warfarin, coumarin).  
 
Stability :  EPA - or DHA -rich fish oil supplement  will be maintained and distributed as 
directed by the supplement  manufacturer to maximize maintenance and the quality of active 
and inactive ingredients in the supplement. Lots will be dated 3 years from expiration. Capsules are not to be frozen. 
 
Off-label use:  Since EPA -rich fish  oil and DHA- rich fish  oil will be used as a dietary 
supplement and intended only to affect the structure or function of the body and not for a 
therapeutic purpose a IND is not needed. Considering the clinical investigation is de signed to 
study the relationship between a dietary supplement’s effect on normal structure or function in humans or to characterize the mechanism by which a dietary supplement acts to maintain such 
structure or function this study would not need to be conducted under an IND.
 Under DSHEA, 
a dietary supplement is not considered a drug and is not subject to the premarket approval requirements for drugs if the intended use for which it is marketed is only to affect the 
structure or any function of the body (i.e ., not intended to be used for a therapeutic purpose). 
Similarly, whether an IND is needed for a clinical investigation evaluating a dietary supplement is determined by the intent of the clinical investigation. If the clinical 
investigation is intended onl y to evaluate the dietary supplement’s effect on the structure or 
function of the body, an IND is not  required. 
  
However, in order to use a reliable source of EPA -rich fish oil and DHA -rich fish oil, since, 
most U.S. over the counter available supplements are not guaranteed to have EPA/DHA 
concentration intended to use in this study, Nippon Suisan Kaisha, Ltd has generously agreed 
to provide reliable EPA -rich and D HA-rich fish oil for this study, which is the same product 
available in the Japanese market, under a clinical supply agreement with NHLBI. Because the 
products are manufactured outside of U.S., FDA guidelines express the requirement of an 
IND, while the US DA requires a parallel approval for the importation of the supplements . 
6. Laboratory Methods

 be limited, using a locked freezer.  Samples and data will be stored, using codes assigned by 
the investigators or their designee(s). Only the  members of the research team w ill have access 
to the samples and data. Data will be collected during scheduled visits. Data will be kept on 
the NHLBI P drive, accessible through password -protected computers  only available for the 
study investigators and the study statistician. Research  samples will be in accordance with 
NHLBI DIR Biospecimen policy. Data will also be stored in locked file cabinets in locked offices in NIH Clinical Center. Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that 
research data can be attributed to an  individual participant.  
 
At the completion of the protocol (termination ), the IRB and FDA will be notified that the 
trial has finished.  
 
8. Monitoring of Subjects and Criteria for Withdrawal of Subjects   
8.1  Stopping Rules for Subjects  
• A single episode of severe gastrointestinal discomfort that in consultation with the 
physician is severe enough to discontinue the protocol  
• Moderate gastrointestinal symptoms that persists for more than 5 consecutive days 
relating to the supplementation an d as determined by contact with the investigator  
• Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
• Anaphylactic reaction due to consumption of the fish oil supplement  
• New onset atrial fibrillation/flutter  
• Major bleeding episode  
• Subjects taking less than 75% of the fish oil  supplement  
• Any other severe symptoms related to the treatment and as determined by contact with 
the physician. 
 
Subjects who are found to be pregnant or wish to breastfeed during the study will 
automatically be withdrawn. A pregnancy screening will be done for all female volunteers at the first visit and  subjects will be  excluded from the study if pregnant.  It is not known 
whether the omega- 3 supplements are  secreted in breast milk. It is therefore not advisable for 
any breastfeeding woman to participate in this study. Adverse effects of omega -3 supplements  
may include atrial fibrillation. Patients that develop symptoms of atrial fibrillation (palpitations, rapid heart rate, fainting, shortness of breath, etc.) will be instructed to visit the emergency roo m and seek treatment immediately.  In order to prevent any future events, 
participants with atrial fibrillation will be withdrawn from the study.  Individuals that develop an allergy to fish  or shellfish may experience an anaphylactic reaction from the treatment and 
will also be required to visit the emergency room immediately and also withdraw from the study.

 9. Analysis of the Study  
The primary outcome measurement of this study is plasma PCSK9 levels. As secondary 
outcome measurements, changes in triglyce rides,  change in LDL -C, lipoprotein particle 
composition and size, HDL cholesterol efflux capacity and  changes in gut Microbiota . Each 
subject will serve as their own control and will not be randomized into separate treatment 
groups.  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
Sample Size Determination and Methods  
 Sample size determination  is based on change in PCSK9 protein concentration between 
the baseline and follow -up measurements. First, change s in PCSK9 values will be transformed 
if necessary to approximate a normal distribution.  Using these transformed change values, a normal approxim ation will be used to estimate the mean and standard deviation.  
 Secondary analysis will investigate the effects of age, gender, BMI, and other factors on 
change in PCSK9 values by using a linear model. Similar analysis for the secondary outcomes of changes in lipid concentrations will also be conducted.     
 Sample Size  
We have no way to estimate the standard deviation, σ, of change in PCSK9 protein 
concentration  in humans .  One of the goals of this pilot study is to obtain such an estimate.  
Our estimate  of standard deviation will be our sample standard deviation, s.  A normal 
approximation gives  
(𝑛𝑛−1)𝑠𝑠2
𝜎𝜎2~𝜒𝜒2
𝑛𝑛−1 
 
with a (1 -β)x100% upper bound of  
𝜎𝜎 ≤ √𝑛𝑛−1 𝑠𝑠
�𝜒𝜒2
𝑛𝑛−1(𝛽𝛽) 
where 𝜒𝜒2
𝑛𝑛−1(𝛽𝛽) is the β quantile of the chi-squared distribution with n-1 degre es of freedom.  
 With 21 evaluable subjects *, an 80% upper bound (β=.2) on σ is 1.2s.  Thus  we would be 
able to conservatively estimate σ for use in planning a main study.  
 
* evaluable subjects are subjects that have completed the full time line of the study (Figure 4), have collected stool specimens 
and thru the analysis of red cell membrane omega -3 fatty acids (RCM) are found to have taken and absorbed the supplement, 
so they can be analyzed for the effect on PCSK9 levels*  
 
Primary endpoint: change in plasma PCSK9 level , compared to baseline, after 6 weeks of 
EPA - or DHA- rich fish oil supplementation.

 9.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
Descriptive statistics will  be calculated for all variables.  A Box -Cox transformation will 
be fit and used to transform the change from baseline values to approximate normality.  The upper bound for σ will be estimated as shown above.  Analysis of the transformed change 
from baseline values will compare the mean ch anges while accounting for period and group 
effects.    
10. Human Subject Protection  
10.1  Rationale for Subject Selection 
 
Subjects of all genders will be considered for inclusion in this study.  There will be no 
racial, ethnic, or gender discrimination.  Cognitively impaired and institutionalized persons 
will not participate in this study.  Criteria for exclusion or withdrawal from the study are based on the presence of other disease processes that may interfere with the interpretation of our results or situations that may be harmful to the health of subjects.  
10.2     Rationale for the Exclusion of Children  
Participant older than 18  will be considered for inclusion in this study. There is not 
sufficient supporting data to establish an upper limit or safe intake of fish oil/omega -3 fatty 
acids, however, the FDA has ruled that intakes of up to 3 g/d of marine omega -3 fatty acids 
are generally recognized as safe for inclusion in the diet34. 
 
10.3 Rationale for the Exclusion of  Pregnant Women  
Subjects must not be pregnant or actively seeking pregnancy in order to participate in this 
study. Pregnancy may introduce unpredictable effects on lipoprotein metabolism and influence the results of the study. The specific effects of preg nancy in this context may be the 
subject of a separate study. Some form of contraception must be used by subjects while enrolled. Contraception use will be determined by a questionnaire given to the subjects at time of enrollment. 
10.4 Inclusion of NIH Sta ff 
NIH staff (employees, NIH contractors, special volunteers, guest researchers, and trainees) 
may voluntarily participate in this protocol.   
• If the individual requesting to participate in the protocol is a co -worker, the consent from the 
NIH staff member (co -worker) will not be obtained by the staff member’s direct supervisor 
but by another research staff member approved for obtaining informed consent  who is not a 
co-worker .

 • Neither participation nor refusal to participate as a subject in this protocol will have an 
effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the participant’s employment or position at NIH.   
• The consenting staff member will make th e NIH Information Sheet on Staff Research 
Participation available to staff members who are considering enrolling in research. ( SOP 
14F, Appendix C Appendix A  of the protocol ) 
• Employee subjects’ privacy and confidentiality will be respected by protocol and consenting staff the same as for all subjects participating in research protocols.  However, all subjects 
will be made aware that there are limits to these protections.  
• Recruitment, enrollment and compensation of NIH employee subjects will be consistent 
with the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Staff in NIH Intramural Research Studies 
(December 2015) (SOP 14F, Appendix A) and NIH Policy Manual Chapter 2300- 630-
3,”Leave Policy for NIH Employees Participating in NIH Medical Research Studies” 
(HRPP SOP 14F, Appe ndix B). 
10.5    Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts 
Benefits: There are no direct benefits to the patient . However , omega -3 supplements  have 
been shown to decrease triglyceride levels in several clinical trials.  These benefits may lead 
to a decreased risk of future cardiovascular events.  Routine clinical laboratory testing and disclosure of results will be available to all subjects.  Subjects are also entitled to being notified of res ults from the clinical cardio -ankle vascular measurement.  
 Risks/Benefit Analysis:  
As of June 25, 2019, this study is now closed to new subject accrual and continues in data  
analysis only and the level of risk is minimal.  
 
Risk (45 CFR 46.102 (h)(i)): The  research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects  
and 
no prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge 
about the condition or disorder under study.  
 
Study Agent:  
EPA-  or DHA -rich fish oil, commercially available fish oil supplements have minimum 
risk to subjects.  
Generally, a dverse effects of omega -3 fatty acid supplement  may include atrial fibrillation 
of new onset and increased propensity for bleeding. Drug interactions may exist between individuals receiving Aspirin or clopidogrel (Plavix).  
The most common side effects of f ish oil includ e taste perversion, and eructation 
(belching).  Participants will be notified of these effects in the informed consent document. Any subject exhibiting s ymptoms of this condition including palpitations, rapid heart rate, or 
shortness of breath will instructed to go to the emergency room immediately and be withdrawn from the study. Individuals with an unknown allergy to fish or shellfish not 
disclosed at screening may experience an anaphylactic reaction, which will also be instructed 
to go immediately to an emergency room and will require withdrawal from the study.  In rare 
cases, fish oil supplement  can trigger allergic reactions. Symptoms may include diffi culty 
breathing, swelling of the face, fever, or flu- like symptoms and a skin rash.  Some studies

20 
 reported consumption of omega -3-fatty acids is associated with a prolongation of bleeding 
time. However, the prolongation of bleeding time has not been shown to surpass normal limits 
and did not result in clinically significant bleeding episodes35,36. Any patient currently treated 
with an anticoagulant will be excluded from this study.  
 Blood Draw: Subjects may feel lightheaded or dizzy after having blood drawn.  There 
may be pain at the vein puncture site and a slight risk of bruising.  To minimize this r isk, the 
routine blood- drawing protocol will be followed and pressure will be applied to the area.  
 The protocol will follow the NIH Clinical Center MAS policy M95 -9 guidelines for limits 
of blood drawn for research purpose in the Clinical Center. For adul ts, no more than 10.5 
mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, will be drawn for research purposes over any 8- week 
period.  
 Cardio- Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI): Inflation of blood pressure cuffs may cause 
transient discomfort. Subjects with fragile skin may s uffer minor trauma (as per ABIs, related 
to usual BP measurements). This procedure involves the use of a VaSera VS -1500N system; 
an FDA approved vascular screening system.  
10.6    Protocol Consent Processes and Documents  
Each subject will receive an oral and written explanation of the goals, procedures, and 
risks of this study.  The original, signed informed consent document will be placed in the medical record, and the subject will receive a signed copy of the informed consent document.  A copy will also be placed in the shadow chart.  A member of the protocol team will be available to answer questions about the study to be performed.   
An individual  who is an AI on the protocol but not a co-worker will obtain consent from NIH 
employees . NIH employees will be given the NIH Information Sheet on Employee Research 
Participation  to help them understand the possible consequences of participation.  
10.7   P atient Advocate  
A patient’s rights representative is available to patients on this protocol.  The 
representative can be reached at  301-496-2626 and is located in Building 10.  Patients may 
ask any questions about the study and may withdraw their consent at any time.  
11. Conflict of Interest  
There are no conflicts of interest with any fin ancial organization regarding the material 
mentioned in this protocol.  
12. Adverse Event  Management  
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure  the safety of each 
patient while on the study. Adverse events will be attributed ( unrelated, unlikely, possibly,

 probably or definitively) to study medication and/ or disease and AEs will be graded by 
severity utilizing CTC version 4.0. A copy of the criteria can be downloaded at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 All adverse events occurring during the study, including those observed by or reported to 
the research team, will be recorded.    
 An abnormal laboratory value or changes from an abnormal baseline value will be 
considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by any of the following:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact  
 If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken  with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.  
 Abnormal laboratory values not associated with clinical symptoms will be evaluated but 
will not be considered an AE.  
 The laboratory results will be monitored by healthcare professionals and documented if 
clinically significant by the MD or any AIs in the  study.  
 Any and all serious adverse events relating to the acquisition of blood samples, such as 
laceration, dissection, thrombosis of an artery, especially if those events cause injury to the hand requiring surgical correction, will be reported verbally and in writing to the Clinical Director of both the NHLBI and the Clinical Center and the chair of the IRB.  The verbal report will occur within 48 hours of the occurrence.  The written report of the serious adverse event (e.g., death or life -threatening adverse event) will be reported within 7 days.  For all 
other serious adverse events relating to the acquisition of blood samples, the written report will be within 15 days. 
 
The PI will report SAEs to the Sponsor according to the requirements of 21 CFR 312.64(b) and as agreed upon with the sponsor. The Sponsor (or designee) will determine the reportability of the event to the FDA and IND safety report will be submitted to the FDA as required as either a IND Safety Report or Annual report.  
 
12.1 IND Annual Report  
 A summary of all SAEs, non- serious  AEs, and other events will be recorded and submitted to 
the Sponsor and FDA in annual progress reports (21 CFR 312.64(b)).  Annual progress reports will be submitted within 60 days after the anniversary date of the IND.

14. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Based on clinical trials, the ome ga-3 fish oil supplements  have been well tolerated and are 
unlikely to increa se morbidity and mortality in subjects meeting the inclusion criteria of the 
study.  
 
Protocol Monitoring  
As per ICH- GCP 5.18 and 21 CFR 312.50 clinical protocols are required to be adequately 
monitored by the study sponsor. The monitoring of this study wil l be conducted by Clinical 
Research Associates (CRAs)/Monitors employed by an independent firm and working under an agreement with NHLBI to monitor aspects of the study in accordance with the appropriate regulations and the approved protocol. The objective s of a monitoring visit will be: 1) to 
verify the existence of signed informed consent form (ICF) and documentation of the ICF process for each monitored subject; 2) to verify the prompt and accurate recording of all monitored data points, and prompt repor ting of all SAEs; 3) to compare abstracted 
information with individual subjects’ records and source documents (subject’s charts, laboratory analyses and test results, physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, and any other relevant original subject inform ation); and 4) to help ensure investigators are in compliance 
with the protocol. The monitors also will inspect the clinical site regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements (Office for Human Research Protections -OHRP), FDA and 
applicable guide lines (ICH -GCP) are being followed. During the monitoring visits, the

 investigator (and/or designee) and other study personnel will be available to discuss the study 
progress and monitoring visit.  
 
The investigator (and/or designee) will make study documents (e.g., consent forms and 
pertinent hospital or clinical records readily available for inspection by the local IRB, the FDA, the site monitors, and the NHLBI staff for confirmation of the study data.  
 
Safety Monitoring  
Principal Investigator: Accrual and safety data will be monitored by the PI.  The protocol 
will be continuously evaluated for any unusual or unpredicted complications with the aim of detecting and preventing unacceptable increase in morbidity and mortality over and above that anticip ated from niacin. 
NHLBI IRB  
Accrual and safety data will be monitored and reviewed annually by the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB).  Prior to implementation of this study, the protocol and the proposed patient informed consent document will be reviewed and approved by the properly constituted IRB operating according to the 45 CFR 46 Code of Federal regulations.  This committee must approve all amendments to the protocol or informed consent document, and conduct continuing annual review so long as the protocol is open to accrual or follow up of subjects.  
FDA:  An annual progress report, any amendments to the protocol, and any change in the 
status of the protocol will be forwarded to the FDA in compliance with 21CFR 312.33

 17. APPENDIX A: NIH INFORMATION SHEET ON STAFF RESEARCH 
PARTICIPATION (DECEMBER 2015)  
As an NIH employee, contractor, Special Volunteer, Guest Researcher, or trainee, you  may  
participate in intramural research studies unless it is prohibited by your Institute or  Center 
(IC), or if you are excluded by the criter ia of the protocol in which you want to  enroll. The 
inclusion of NIH staff in a particular protocol must also be approved by the  IRB. You may be 
motivated by altruism, a commitment to research in your own or related fields, or want 
access to clinical trials of potential direct therapeutic benefit.  When deciding, you should 
make an informed decision about participation. This  information sheet offers some points to 
consider for NIH staff who are considering  research participation at NIH.  
 
First, similar to an y individual who is considering research participation, you should seek 
adequate information about the study purpose, what is required of you in terms of 
procedures, interventions and time, and the potential risks and benefits of participation.  For 
more information, see the NIH Clinical Center’s public website “Are Clinical Studies  for You?” 
at http://www.cc.nih.gov/participate/studies.shtml . 
 When you are thinking about participation in a research study that is being conducted by 
your supervisor, or others with whom you work closely in your laboratory, branch, or  unit, 
you should consider some additional factors:  
 A. Possible bias: Are you confident that you can be unbias ed about reporting  answers, side 
effects, or other information that could influence the study outcome  or risk to you?  
 B. Confidentiality: Are you comfortable sharing your medical history (including, for example, 
mental health history or STDs) and your soc ial history (e.g. substance  use) with study 
investigators who may be your coworkers, or with the possibility  of them discovering  
something about your health during the study (e.g.  pregnancy status or a new diagnosis)? 
Although every effort will be made to  protect your information and keep it private and 
confidential, your information will be available in medical records and it will be available to  
authorized users  outside of the study team, both in an identifiable and unidentified manner.   
 C. Pressure : Do you perceive any pressure or expectations from your supervisor  or 
colleagues regarding participation? Could that pressure influence your  decision or make it 
difficult for you to choose whether or not to participate?  Remember that it is your choice 
whether or not to participate and that your decision to participate or not should not have an 
effect, either beneficial or adverse, on your position at NIH.  
 D. Time and Compensation:  Can you take time off from work to complete the  study  
requirements or participat e solely during non- duty hours? Can you receive  compensation for  
your participation in this study? Will your supervisor give you  permission to participate

 during work hours? See the NIH Policy Manual 2300 - 630- 3 Leave Policy for NIH Employees 
Participating  in NIH Medical Research  Studies.  
 
E. Consent Process:  Is the person obtaining your consent for the study your  supervisor, a 
subordinate, or co -worker? If so, is there an independent person monitoring the consent 
process? If the study PI is a supervisor and intends to  obtain consent from you, an 
independent person (e.g., through Bioethics or the  NIMH Human Subjects Protections Unit 
[HSPU], or others as approved by the  IRB) must monitor the consent process. If the person 
obtaining consent from y ou is a co -worker then an independent person (e.g., through 
Bioethics or the NIMH  HSPU, or others as approved by the IRB) may be required to monitor 
the consent process, as determined by the IRB for the specific study.  
 
If you are thinking of enrolling as a subject at the NIH Clinical Center and you have any  
questions or concerns, please contact the Office of Human Subjects Research Protections 
(OHSRP) at 301- 402-3444 and/ or the Patient Representative if you are  thinking of enrolling 
as a subject at the NI H Clinical Center on 301 -496-2626. If you are  at a NIH site outside the 
Clinical Center then please contact local site leadership.

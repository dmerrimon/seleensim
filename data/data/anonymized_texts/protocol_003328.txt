13-JAN-2011  6 SYNOPSIS  
Detailed Title  A phase IIIb, open -label, multi -centre immunization study to 
evaluate the safety of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ 
HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine administered 
intramuscularly according to a 0, 1, 6 -month schedule in 
healthy female subjects who received the placebo control in 
the GSK HPV -015 study  
Indication  Cervari x is indicated in females from 10 years of age onwards 
for the prevention of persistent infection, premalignant 
cervical lesions and cervical cancer (squamous -cell carcinoma 
and adenocarcinoma) caused by oncogenic Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) types . 
Rationa le for the 
study and study 
design  Subjects in the HPV -015 study either received the HPV -16/18 
L1 VLP AS04 vaccine or placebo control [Al(OH) 3], 
following a 0, 1, 6 -month vaccination schedule. According to 
the HPV -015 protocol, once the HPV -015 study was 
concluded, the control placebo group would be offered the 
HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine as well.  
As recommended by the study Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC), unblinding and cross -over immunization 
of control recipients with the HPV vaccine will  be provided 
after completion of their end of study activities as follows:  
• For subjects who complete study activities after the 
database is frozen for final analysis, unblinding will occur 
within 4 -6 months after last subject last visit (LSLV) of 
the final  study visit.  
• Subjects who will not participate in any of the extensions 
will be given the option of unblinding before the database 
is frozen for final analysis upon individual request.  
The HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine is licensed in the 
participating countries, but it is not indicated for the age group 
(26 years and above) involved in the HPV -015 study  and this 
study . Approximately 6 00 subjects from the control placebo 
group are expected to enrol in this study . 
This study is thus being conducted to enable  all women, who 
received the control placebo in the HPV -015 study, to also 
receive HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine. Safety data in 
terms of SAEs, medically significant conditions and 
pregnancy (and their outcomes) will be collected during the 
study period.  
Objective (s) • To assess the safety of the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 
vaccine throughout the study period.

planned a t Months 0, 1, 6. There will be a telephone 
contact with the subject at Month 12  (i.e. six month s after 
the third dose of the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine).  
• Safety monitoring:  
 All serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring 
throughout the study period (i.e. from Day 0 up to the 
telephone contact at Month 12) will be reported for all 
subjects.  
 Medically significant conditions (including potential 
immune -mediated diseases [pIMDs]) will be reported 
for all subjects throughout the st udy period.  
 Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes will be reported 
for all subjects throughout the study period.  
Number of subjects  Approximately 6 00 subjects are planned to participate to this 
cross -over vaccination study.

Adequate contraception : Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive 
method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when 
used consistently and correctly (when a pplicable, as 
mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, 
combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable 
progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic 
vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or 
intrauterine device (IUD)  or intrauterine system (IUS), 
vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole 
male partner or male condom combined with a vaginal 
spermicide (foam, gel, film, cream or suppository) or 
male condom combined with a female diaphragm, either 
with or without a vaginal spermicide (foam, gel, film, 
cream, or suppository) .  
For azoospermia, ‘documented ’ refers to the laboratory 
report of azoospermia, required for acceptable 
documentation of successful vasectomy in the subject’s 
male partner.  
Adverse event:  Any u ntoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 
sign ( including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For 
marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to 
produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy),  abuse or 
misuse.  
Eligible:  Qualified for enrolment into the study based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
eTrack : GSK’s tracking tool  for clinical trials.  
Global Study Manager  An individual assigned by GSK Biologicals Headquarters 
who is responsible for assuring the co -ordination of the 
operational aspects and proper conduct of a clinical study,

1.1. Background  
Cervical cancer is the most importan t manifestation of genital human papillomavirus 
(HPV) infection and is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in women worldwide 
[Parkin , 2001a; Parkin , 2001b]. Papillom aviruses, members of the papovaviridae family, 
are non -enveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses which can cause a variety of 
proliferative epithelial lesions in humans, including benign papillomas (warts) and 
invasive cancer [ Lowy , 2001; Zur Hausen , 2002].  
Currently, over 200 different types of HPVs have been recognized. Based on whether 
they infect basal epithelial cells of the skin or the inner lining of tissues, they are 
categorized as  cutaneous or mucosal types [ Burd , 2003]. At least 30 HPV types have 
been identified that infect the genital mucosa [ Bosch , 1995]. HPV types are also 
classified by their relative ma lignant potential into low -risk (LR) types ( e.g. HPV -6, -11, 
-42, -43, and -44) and high -risk (HR) or oncogenic  types ( e.g. HPV -16, -18, -31, -33, -34, 
-35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -56, -58, -59, -66, -68 and -70) [ Burd , 2003]. Persistent infection 
with an oncogenic HPV type has been clearly associated with the development of 
cervical cancer [ Schiffman , 2005] and the association between cervical cancer and 
infection with a HR HPV typ e is supported both by strong epidemiological evidence and 
the detection of HPV DNA in up to 99.7% of cervical cancers worldwide [Schiffman  
2005; Burd  2003].  
The distribution of  HPV types varies within countries and between regions. HPV -16 and 
HPV -18 are the first and second most common types in all regions, with some variation 
in their distribution. HPV -16 is the most prevalent oncogenic HPV type and is present in 
approximately 54% of cervical tumor specimens worldwide. HPV -18 is associated with 
approximately 17% of cervical cancers, with the remaining tumors containing DNA from 
other oncogenic HPV types such as HPV -45 and -31. In combination, these two HPV 
types (HPV -16 and HPV -18) account for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases 
globally [Clifford  2003] . 
In the general population, the estimated worldwide prevalence of HPV among women is 
between 5% and 40% [ Baseman , 2005; Franco , 1999]. This wide variation reflects 
underlying population characteristics  (i.e. age range, geographic area, risk behaviours), 
the use of different HPV DNA test methods, and also di fferences in the sexual activity of 
the individuals studied. Assuming a conservative prevalence of 10% in developed 
countries and 15% in developing countries, one author estimated 270 million HPV 
infections amongst women globally [ Bosch , 2002].  
1.2. GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’ HPV Vaccine  
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)  Biologicals has developed a candidate prophylactic HPV 
vaccine based on L1 proteins of HPV -16 and HPV -18 formulated with AS04 ( comprised 
of aluminium hydroxide [Al(O H)3] and 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl  lipid A [MPL] ). 
The vaccine contains HPV -16 and HPV -18 L1 VLP proteins produced using an 
CONFIDENTI AL 
  1136 21 (HPV -067 EXT 015)  
  Amendment 2 
13-JAN-2011  18 expression system based on the use of insect cells and recombinant Baculoviruses 
encoding L1 proteins of HPV -16 and HPV -18. The recombinant expressed proteins 
undergo  self-assembly to form empty viral capsids referred to as virus -like particles 
(VLPs) [ Kirnbauer , 1992]. A study comparing different vaccine formulations 
demonstrated that the  highest antibody titres were induced by AS04 -adjuvanted vaccine 
formulations [ Giannini , 2006]. The AS04 adjuvant system is comprised of aluminium 
salts (Al(OH) 3) and 3 -O-desacyl -4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and  is also used in 
other vaccines, including a hepatitis B vaccine licensed in Europe for use in 
haemodialysis patients from the age of 15 years and above under the name Fendrix as 
well as in an investigational HSV vaccine.   
To date, more than 60 000 adolesc ent and adult females aged 9 years and above have 
received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine in clinical studies.  A pooled safety analysis 
of data from almost 30 000 adolescent and adult females aged 10 years and above, of 
whom 16 142 received at least one dose of HPV vaccine, showed the v accine to be  
generally well tolerated  in women of all ages [ Descamps , 2009].  In this publication , 
subjects from the HPV -015 trial were included and the safety profile in women aged 26 
and above  was similar to the one in 15 -25 year olds who received the vaccine.  
Results of a large multinational phase III trial in women aged 15 -25 years demonstrated 
high vaccine efficacy against cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and above 
(CIN2+), CIN1+ a nd persistent infection (6 -month and 12 -month definition) associated 
with HPV -16 and/or H PV-18, significant vaccine efficacy against CIN2+ and CIN3+ 
irrespective of HPV type in the lesion as well as evidence of protection against HPV 
types 31, 33 and 45 [Paav onen , 2009 ]. This study also demonstrated the vaccine to be 
generally well tolerated in a broad range of women including those of different 
nationalities and ethnicities [ Paavonen , 2007 ]. 
A long -term eff icacy follow -up study in women aged 15 -25 years at the time of first 
vaccination demonstrated high vaccine efficacy against incident and persistent HPV -
16/18 infections and their associated cervical lesions up to 6.4 years of follow -up [Gall, 
2007; Harper , 2004 ; Harper , 2006 ; The GlaxoSmithKline Vaccine HPV -007 Study 
Group , 2009].  
When tested in young female adolescents, the vaccine induced immune responses that 
were approximately 2 -fold higher than those elicited in women 15 -25 years of age 
[Pedersen , 2007]. In women up to 55 years of age, t he vaccine induced  sustained HPV 
antibody levels up to Month 24 after the first vaccine dose and these a ntibody levels 
remained significantly higher than those seen after natural infection [ Schwarz , 200 9]. 
The first major market in which the vaccine under evaluation in this study  was licensed  is 
Australia , where licensure was obtained  in May 2007 for use in 10 to 45 year old females . 
The vaccine is marketed under the  trade name Cervarix . In September 2007, the vaccine 
was licensed in the European Union for the prevention of high -grade cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN grades 2 an d 3) and cervical cancer causally related to 
HPV types 16 and 18.  In October 2009, Cervarix  has also been approved by the United 
States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA ) for use  in females 10 through 25 years 
of age. The vaccine is currently licensed  in over 100  countries  worldwide.

vaccine formulated with AS04.  
1.3. Rationale for th e study  and study design  
Subjects in the HPV -015 study either received the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine or 
placebo  control [Al(OH) 3], following  a 0, 1, 6 -month vaccination schedule. According to 
the HPV -015 protocol, once the HPV -015 study was concluded, the control placebo  
group would be offered the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine as well.  
As recommended by the study Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), 
unblinding and cross -over immunization of control recipients with the HPV vaccine will 
be provi ded after completion of their end of study activities as follows:  
• For subjects who complete study activities after the database is frozen for final 
analysis, unblinding will occur within 4-6 months after last subject last visit (LSLV) 
of the final study vi sit. 
• Subjects who will not participate in any of the extensions  will be given the option of 
unblinding before the database is frozen for final analysis upon individual request.  
The HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine is licensed in the participating countries, b ut it is 
not indicated for the age group (26 years and above) involved in the HPV -015 study and 
this study. Approximately 600 subjects from the control placebo group are expected to 
enrol in this study.  
This study is thus being conducted to enable all wome n, who received the control placebo 
in the HPV -015 study, to also receive HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine. Safety data in 
terms of SAEs , medically significant conditions and pregnancy (and their outcomes)  will 
be collected during the study period.

measured prior to any study vaccine administration . The preferred route for recording 
temperature in this study will be oral  or axillary . If the subject has fever [fever is defined 
as temperature  37.5°C (99.5°F) on oral  or, axillary or tympanic setting, or  38.0°C 
(100.4°F) on rectal setting]  on the day of vaccination, the vaccination visit will be 
rescheduled within the interval for this visit (see Table 2). 
5.6.3.5.  Vaccination  
• After completing  the prerequisite procedures prior to vaccination, one dose of study 
vaccine  will be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid of the non -dominant 
arm (refer to Section 6.3 for detailed descripti on of the vaccine administration 
procedure). If the investigator or delegate determines that the subject’s health on the 
day of vaccination temporarily precludes vaccination, the visit will be rescheduled 
within the interval for this visit.  
• The vaccinees w ill be observed closely for at least 30 minutes, with appropriate 
medical treatment readily available in case of anaphylaxis following the 
administration of vaccine.  
5.6.3.6.  Recording of medically significant conditions  and SAEs  
• Refe r to Section 8.3 for procedures for the Investigator to record AEs (medically 
significant conditions only) and SAEs that are related to study participation or GSK 
concomitant medicat ion/vaccination and to Section 8.4 for guidelines on how to 
report these AEs/SAEs to GSK Biologicals.  
• The subjects  will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately should they 
manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as serious.  
• Refer to the Refer to the Glossary Of Terms  for the definition of medically 
significant conditions  
5.6.4.  Procedures during follow -up phone contact  
• The investigator or his/her designee will contact the subjects by telephone 
approximately six month s after the third vaccine dose to obtain information on the 
occurrence of any  of the  safety endpoints.  
• The procedures to be performed during the follow -up telephone contact such as 
recording of any concomitant medication/vaccination or medical treatment  and 
recording of medically significant conditions and SAEs are also performed during

13-JAN-2011  29 6.2. Storage and h andling of study vaccine  
The study vaccine  to be administered to the subjects must be stored in a safe and locked 
place with no access by unauthor ised personnel.  
The study vaccine  must  be stored at the defined temperature range (i.e. +2 to +8°C /36F 
to 46F). Please refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies  in the SPM  for more 
details on storage of the study vaccine.  The storage temperature of the vaccine  will be 
monitored daily with temperature monitoring device(s) (at the minimum calibrated) and 
will be recorded as specified in the SPM .  
The storage conditions will be assessed during pre -study activities u nder the 
responsibility of the s ponsor study contact.  
Any temperature deviation  outside the range 0 to + 8C/32 to 46F must be reported to the 
spon sor as soon as detected. Following an exposure to a temperature deviation, vaccine  
will not be used until written approval has been given by the Sponsor . 
In case of temperature deviation between 0 and +2°C/32 and 36°F , the impacted study 
vaccine can still be administered, but the site must take adequate actions to go back to the 
defined range +2 to +8°C/36 to 46°F  and avoid re -occurrence of such a temperature 
deviation.  
Please r efer to  the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies  in the SPM  for details and 
instruc tions on the Temperature deviation process, packaging and accountability of the 
study vaccine.  
6.3. Dosage and administration  of study vaccine  
GSK Biologicals will supply the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine as 0.6 ml liquid in 
pre-filled syringes to be administer ed (0.5ml) into the deltoid of the non -dominant arm on 
a 0, 1, 6 month schedule (refer to  Table 4). Additional syringes will be provided to each 
site to replace broken, lost or damaged syringes as needed.  
The HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04  vaccine is provided as individual pre -filled syringes for 
single use. Each syringe must be brought to room temperature and resuspended (by 
inversion) prior to injection by standard aseptic technique. The study vaccine must be 
used as soon as possible afte r preparation of the syringe.

In addition to the vaccine doses provided for the planned number of subjects (including 
over-random isation when applicable), at least 5% additional doses will be supplied to 
replace those that are unusable.  
6.5. Contraindications to subsequent vaccination  
The following events constitute absolute contraindications to further administration of the 
HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine . If any of these events occur during the study, the 
subjec t must not receive additional doses of vaccine but may continue other study 
procedures at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 8.4.5 ).  
• Anaphylaxis following the administration of the vaccine.  
• Pregnan cy (see Section 8.2)  
• Any serious adverse event (SAE) judged to be related to study vaccine.  
• Administration of another HPV vaccine during the study other than that foreseen by 
protocol.  
• Any acute or newly acquired chronic condi tion at the time of scheduled vaccination, 
which in the opinion of the investigator precludes further administration of the study 
vaccine.  
• Other significant reactions which in the opinion of the investigator (or designate) 
preclude further administration o f the study vaccine (may include severe pain, severe 
swelling, severe limitation of motion, persistent high fever, severe headache or other 
systemic or local reactions).  
• Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, 
including h uman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  
The following events constitute contraindications to administration of the HPV -16/18 L1 
VLP AS04 vaccine  at that point in time; if any of these events occur at the time 
scheduled for vaccination, the subject may  be vaccinated at a later date, within the time 
window specified in the protocol (see Section 5.5), or withdrawn at the discretion of the 
investigator (see Section 8.4.5 ).  
• Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination.  
• Fever is defined as temperature ≥  37.5°C (99.5°F) on oral, axillary or tympanic 
setting, or  38.0°C (100.4°F) on rectal setting. The preferred route for recording 
temperature in this study will  be oral  or axillary . 
• Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory 
infection) without fever can be administered the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 
vaccine .

13-JAN-2011  31 6.6. Concomitant medication/ vaccination  
At each study visit/ contact, the investi gator should question the subject  if she received 
any HPV vaccine other than that foreseen in the study protocol at any time during the 
study period. The trade name of the vaccine, route of administration and date(s) of 
administration should be recorded  in the eCRF . Refer to  Section s 4.3 and 6.5. 
At each study visit/contact, the investigator should question  the subject a bout any 
medication taken  and vaccination received  by the subject . 
All concomitan t medication /vaccination , with the exception of vitamins and/or dietary 
supplements, are to be recorded in the eCRF . This also applies to concomitant medication 
administered prophylactically in anticipation of reaction to the vaccination and any 
medication  intended to treat an AE.  
A prophylactic medication is a medication administered in the absence of ANY  symptom 
and in anticipation of a reaction to the vaccination (e.g. an anti -pyretic is considered to be 
prophylactic when it is given in the absence of f ever and any other symptom, to prevent 
fever from occurring  [fever is defined as temperature  37.5°C (99.5°F) on oral, axillary 
or tympanic setting, or  38.0°C (100.4°F) on rectal setting] ).  
Any treatments and/or medications specifically contraindicated , administered at any time 
during the study period are to be recorded with generic name of the medication (trade 
names are allowed for combination drugs only), medical indication, total daily dose, 
route of administration, start and end dates of treatment.  Refer to  Section s 4.3 and 6.5. 
Similarly, concomitant medication administered for the treatment of a SAE, at any time, 
must be recorded on the SAE  Report / SAE  screens in the eCRF, as applicable . Refer to 
Section 8.1.2  for the definition of a SAE.  
6.6.1.  Time window for recording concomitant medication/ vaccination  
in the eCRF  
All concomitant medication s, with the exception of vitamins and/or dietary supplements, 
administered at ANY  time during the period starting with the administration of each dose 
of study vaccine and ending 30 days  after each  dose of study vaccine must  be recorded in 
the eCRF . 
Any vaccine not foreseen in the study protocol administered in the period beginning 30 
days precedin g each  dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days  after each  dose of study 
vaccine must  be recorded in the eCRF.  
Any investigational medication or vaccine administered throughout the study (i.e. from 
Day 0 through Month 12) must be recorded in the eCRF.

13-JAN-2011  32 8. ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S 
The investigator  or site staff is/are responsible during the study for the detection and 
documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (A E) or 
serious adverse event (SAE) as provided in this protocol .  
Each subject  will be instructed to contact the invest igator immediately should they/ the 
subject manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as serious.  
NOTE: The term AE denotes both non -serious and serious adverse events. In this study, 
only SAEs and non -serious AEs that are medically significant conditions will be 
reported.  
8.1. Safety definitions  
8.1.1.  Definition of an adverse event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation  subject, temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (ne w or exacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
Examples of an AE include:  
• Medically significan t conditions  (please refer to Section 8.1.4  for the definition of 
medically significant condition).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and /or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration 
even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).  
• Signs, symptoms temporally associated with vaccine administration.  
Examples of an AE DO NOT  include:  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
CONFIDENTI AL 
  1136 21 (HPV -067 EXT 015)  
  Amendment 2 
13-JAN-2011  33 • Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
AEs may include pre - or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -
mandated procedures (i.e. inva sive procedures, modification of subject’s previous 
therapeutic regimen).  
Example of events to be recorded in the medical history section of the eCRF:  
• Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a subject prior to the 
start of the study (i. e. prior to the first study vaccination).  
NOTE: In this study, only SAEs and non -serious AEs that are medically significant 
conditions will be reported.  
8.1.2.  Definition of a serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence  that: 
a. Results in death . 
b. Is life -threatening . 
NB: The term ‘life -threatening’  in the definition of ‘serious’  refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might ha ve caused death, had it been  more severe.  
c. Requires hospitalis ation  or prolongation of existing hospital isation . 
NB: In general, hospitalis ation  signifies that the subject has been admitted  at the 
hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospital isation  are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospital isation  or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospital isation ’ occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NB: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza  like illness , and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained 
ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject . 
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporti ng is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalis ation  but may jeopardis e the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. 
CONFIDENTI AL 
  1136 21 (HPV -067 EXT 015)  
  Amendment 2 
13-JAN-2011  34 Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsion s 
that do not result in hospital isation . 
8.1.3.  Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualifying as  adverse  events or serious adverse events  
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis) or other 
abnormal  assessments (e.g. ECGs, X -rays, vital signs, etc ) that are judged by the 
investigator to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the 
definition of an AE, as defined in Section 8.1.1  or of a SAE, as defined in Section 8.1.2 . 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that 
are detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen following 
the sta rt of the study will be reported as medically significant conditions or SAEs, if 
applicable.  
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clini cally 
significant.  
8.1.4.  Medically significant conditions  
Medically significant conditions are defined as:  
• AEs prompting emergency room or physician visits that are:  
1. not related to common diseases, or  
2. not related to routine visits for physical examination or va ccination  
• SAEs that are not related to common diseases.  
Common diseases include: upper respiratory infections, sinusitis, pharyngitis, 
gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, cervicovaginal yeast infections, menstrual cycle 
abnormalities and injury.  
Medically significant conditions include pIMDs.  
8.1.4.1.  Potential immune -mediated diseases  
Potential immune -mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset of medically significant 
conditions that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic 
disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology. AEs that need 
to be recorded and reported as pIMDs include those listed in the table below.  
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgement in 
deciding whether other immune -mediated diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. 
pathophysiology involving systemic or organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and 
should also be recorded as a pIMD.

  Amendment 2 
13-JAN-2011  36 When there is enough evidence to make any of the above diagnoses, the AE must be 
reported as a pIMD. Symptoms, signs or conditions which might (or might not) represent 
the above diagnoses, should b e recorded and reported as AEs but not as pIMDs until the 
final or definitive diagnosis has been determined, and alternative diagnoses have been 
eliminated or shown to be less likely.  
In order to facilitate the documentation of pIMDs in the eCRF, a pIMD st andard 
questionnaire and a list of preferred terms (PTs) and PT codes corresponding to the above 
diagnoses will be available to investigators at study start.  
8.2. Pregnancy  
Any female subjects  that are pregnant or lactating  at the time of vaccination must not 
receive ad ditional doses of study vaccine  but may continue other study procedures at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical rea sons will be recorded as an AE or a 
SAE, as described in Section 8.1.1  and 8.1.2 , and will be followed as described in Section  
8.4.5 . 
A spont aneous abortion is always considered to be a SAE and will be reported as 
described in Section 8.4. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study 
pregnancy AND  considered by the investigator to be reasonably related in time to the 
receipt of the investigational product will be reported to GSK Biologicals as described in 
Section 8.4. While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information f rom 
former study participants, he/she may learn of a pregnancy through spontaneous 
reporting.  
Information on pregnancies identified during screening/prior to vaccine administration is 
not required  to be collected  and communicated to safety.  
8.3. Detecting and recording adverse events, serious adverse 
events  and pregnancies  
8.3.1.  Time period  for detecting  and recording adverse events, serious

The standard time period for collecting and recording medically significant conditions 
will begin  at the first receipt of study vaccine and will end 6 months following the 
administration of the last dose of study vaccine (i.e. at study conclusion) for each subject. 
Medically significant conditions should be recorded in the AE screen of the subjects 
eCRF if they are non -serious and in the SAE screen of the subject’s eCRF if they are 
serious. W hen the medically significant c ondition is considered as a pIMD, it always has 
to be reported in the SAE screen of the subject’s eCRF . See also Section 8.4 for

he/she considers the event reasonably related to the investigational product, the 
investigator will  promptly notify the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs.

13-JAN-2011  38 8.3.2.  Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events  
8.3.2.1.  Active questioning to detect  adverse events and serious adverse 
events  
The investigator will inquire about the occurrence of SAEs and medically s ignificant 
conditions, pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes at each visit during the study and at the 
telephone contact at Month 12. 
All AEs either observed by the investigator or one of his clinical collabora tors or reported 
by the subject  spontaneously or in response to a direct question will be evaluated by the 
investigator  for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and 
definition of SAEs and/or medically significant conditions . AEs not previously 
documented in the study will be rec orded on the Adverse Event screen within the 
subject's eCRF, if applicable . The nature of each event, date and time (where appropriate) 
of onset, outcome, intensity and relationship to the HPV vaccin e should be entered . 
Details of any corrective treatment should be recorded on the appropriate page of the 
eCRF. Refer to Section 6.6. 
As a consistent method of soliciting AEs, the subject should be asked a non -leading 
question such as:  
‘Have you felt different in any w ay since receiving the vacci ne or since the previous 
visit? ’ 
AEs already documented in the eCRF, i.e. at a previous assessment, and designated as 
“not recovered/not resolved” or “recovering/resolving” should be reviewed at subsequent 
visits, as necessary. If these have resolved, the documentation in the eCRF s hould be 
completed.  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the e vent. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE on the eCRF  or SAE screens  as applicable. It is not acceptable for the 
investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to GSK Biologicals 
instead  of the appropriate completed AE/SAE screens  in the eCRF . However, there may 
be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by GSK 
Biologicals. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the 
medical reco rds prior to submission to GSK Biologicals.  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  
The electronic system using SAE screens in the eCRF will be the primary mode for 
reporting SAEs to GSK Biologicals during the study period. In case this electronic 
system for reporting SAEs does not work or after freezing of the subject's eCRF, paper 
SAE Report Forms and the facsimile (Fax) system should be used to report SAEs. Refer 
to Section 8.4.3.1  for details of the back -up reporting system.

  Amendment 2 
13-JAN-2011  39 8.3.2.2.  Assessment of adverse events  
8.3.2.2.1.  Assessm ent of i ntensity  
The investigator will assess  the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all other AEs, including SAEs reported during the study. The assessment will be 
based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.  
The intensi ty of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF  or SAE screen s, as applicable, 
should be assigned to one of the following categories:  
1 (mild)  = An AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activit ies. 
2 (moderate)  = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
3 (severe)  = An AE which preve nts normal, everyday activities  (In 
adults/ adolescents, such an AE would, for examp le, prevent 
attendance at work/ school and would necessitate the 
administration of corrective therapy.)  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category utili sed for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can 
be assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.3.2.2.2.  Assessment of causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational pro duct 
and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgement to 
determine the relationship. Alternative plausible causes, based on  natural history of the 
underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors and the temporal relationship 
of the event to the investigational product will be considered and investigated. The 
investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure and/or Product Information for 
marketed products, in the determination of his/her  assessment.  
There m ay be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However, it is very 
important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event 
prior to submission of the SAE to GSK Biologicals. The investigator may change his/her  
opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE information 
accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory  reporting requirements.

  Amendment 2 
13-JAN-2011  40 Causality of all other AEs than local (injection site) reactions should be assessed by the 
investigator using the following question:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the investigational 
product ? 
NO : The AE is not causally related to administration of the study 
vaccine(s). There are other, more likely causes and administration 
of the study vaccine(s) is not suspected to have contributed to the 
AE. 
YES  : There is a reasonable possibility that th e vaccine(s) contributed to 
the AE.  
Non-serious and serious AEs will be evaluated as two distinct events. If an event meets 
criteria to be determined ‘serious’  (see Section 8.1.2  for definition of serious adverse 
event), additional examinations/tests will be performed  by the investigator in order  to 
determine ALL possible contributing factors applicable to each SAE . 
Possible contribut ing factors include:  
• Medical history  
• Other medication  
• Protocol required procedure  
• Other proced ure not required by the protocol  
• Lack of efficacy of the vaccine, if applicable  
• Erroneous administration  
• Other cause (specify).  
8.3.2.3.  Assessment of outcomes  
Outcome of any non-serious AE or SAE reported during the entire study will be assessed 
as: 
• Recovered/reso lved 
• Not recovered/not resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae  
• Fatal (SAEs only).

SAEs will be reported promptly to GSK as described in Table 7 once the investigator 
determines that the event meets the protocol definition  of an SAE . 
Pregnancies will be reported promptly to GSK as described in Table 7 once the 
investigator becomes aware of a pregnancy in the time period defined in Section 8.3. The 
subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. At the end of the 
pregnancy, whether that be full -term or premature, information on the status of the 
mother and child will be forwarded to GSK. Generally, follow -up should be no lon ger 
than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.  
Any pIMDs that occur in the time period defined in Section 8.3.1 will be reported 
promptly to GSK within the timeframes described in Table 7, once the investigator 
becomes aware of the pIMD.

13-JAN-2011  42 8.4.2.  Regulatory reporting requirements for serious adverse events  
The investigator will promptly report all SAEs  to GSK in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section 8.4.1 . GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility to promptly notify, 
as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agenci es about the 
safety of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the 
investigator to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other subjects are met.  
Investigator safety reports are prepared according to the current GSK policy and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator safety report is prepared for a 
SAE(s) that is both attributable to the investigational product and unexp ected. The 
purpose of the report is to fulfil specific regulatory and GCP requirements, regarding the 
product under investigation.  
8.4.3.  Completion and transmission of SAEs reports to GSK Biologicals  
Once an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, the 
investigator will complete and submit the information in the SAE screens in eCRF within 
24 hours. The SAE screens in eCRF will always be completed as thoroughly as possible 
with all available details of the event and will be submitted by the investigator. If the 
investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying GSK of the event and completing the 
SAE screens in eCRF. The SAE screens in eCRF should be upda ted when additional  
relevant  information is received WITHIN 24 HOURS . 
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report.  
8.4.3.1.  Back -up system in case the electronic SAE reporting system does not 
work  
If the SAE rep orting system has been down for 24 hours, the investigator or his/her 
delegate should fax an SAE report form directly to the GSK Central Safety department 
(please refer to Section 8.4.1 ) within 24 hours. The max imum timeline for reporting 
SAEs to central safety is therefore 48 hours.  
NB. This back -up system should only be used if the electronic reporting system is not 
working and NOT if the system is slow.  
As soon as the electronic reporting system is working ag ain, the investigator or delegate 
must update the SAE screens in the eCRF within 24 hours.  
The final valid information for regulatory reporting will be the information reported 
through the electronic system.  
When additional information is received on a S AE aft er freezing of the subject’ s eCRF, 
new or updated information is to be recorded on the paper SAE Report Form, with all 
CONFIDENTI AL 
  1136 21 (HPV -067 EXT 015)  
  Amendment 2 
13-JAN-2011  43 changes signed and dated by the investigator. The updated SAE Report Form should be 
sent to GSK Biologicals WITHIN 24 HOURS of rece ipt of the follow -up information.  
In rare circumstances, if the electronic system for reporting SAEs does not work and in 
the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable, with a copy 
of the SAE Report Form sent by email or by ma il. Initial notification via the telephone 
does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and submit SAE screens in the 
eCRF (or complete and sign the SAE Report Form if back -up system need to be used).  
In the event of a death determined by the  investigator to be related to vaccination, 
completi on of SAE screens in the eCRF/ sending of the fax (if electronic SAE reporting 
system does not work o r after freezing of the subject’ s eCRF) must be accompanied by 
telephone call to the Study Contact for R eporting SAEs.  
8.4.3.2.  Updating of SAE information after freezing of the subject's eCRF  
When additional information is received on a SAE after freezing of the subject's eCRF, 
new or updated information should be recorded on a SAE Report Form, with all changes 
signed and dated by the investigator. The updated form should be faxed to the GSK 
Biologicals Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department or to the Study Contact 
for Reporting SAEs (refer to the Sponsor Information Sheet) WITHIN 24 HOURS of 
receipt of the  follow -up information.  
8.4.4.  Reporting of pIMDs to GSK Biologicals  
Once onset of a new pIMD or exacerbation of a pre -existing pIMD is diagnosed (serious 
or non -serious) in a study subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete the 
information in the SAE  screens of the eCRF WITHIN 24 HOURS after the he/she 
becomes aware of the diagnosis. A field on the SAE screen allows to specify that the 
event is a pIMD and whether it is serious or non serious. The SAE screens will always be 
completed as thoroughly as p ossible with all available details of the event, in accordance 
with the pIMD standard questionnaire provided. Even if the investigator does not have all 
information regarding a pIMD, the SAE screens should still be completed within 24 
hours. Once additiona l relevant information is received, the SAE screens in the eCRF 
should be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS.  
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report.  
Refer to Sections 8.4.3.1  and 8.4.3.2  for back -up system and updating of SAE 
information after freezing of the subject's eCRF.  
8.4.5.  Follow -up of adverse events and serious adverse events  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactive ly follow each 
subject and provide further information to GSK Biologicals on the subject’s condition.

visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not resolved or recovering /resolving will be 
reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts  until the end of the study . 
Investigators will follow -up subjects:  
• With SAEs or subjects withdrawn from the study as a result of an AE, until the event 
has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeare d, or until the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  
• Or, in the case of other non -serious AEs  (medically significant conditions only) , until 
they complete the study  or the y are lost to follow -up.   
Clinically significant labo ratory abnormalities  will be followed up until they have 
returned to normal, or a satisfactory explanation has been provided. Additional 
information (including but not limited to laboratory results) relative to the subsequent 
course of such abnormalit ies noted for any subject must be made available to the Site 
Monitor.  
GSK Biologicals may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests  and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. If a 
subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognised follow -up period, 
GSK Biologicals will be provided with a copy of any available post -mortem find ings, 
inclu ding histopathology.  
8.5. Treatment of adverse events

hereunder is limited to the unblinding of SAEs to any third parties (e.g. any doctor other 
than the study investigator), in accordance with GSK Biologicals’ standard operating 
procedures.  
The investigator, or oth er physician managing the subject, should contact GSK 
Biologicals’ Central Safety Physician to discuss the need for emergency unblinding.

An investigator should request for unblinding of the su bject’s treatment code only in the 
case of a medical emergency, or in the event of a serious medical condition, when 
knowledge of the investigational study vaccine(s)/product (s) is essential for the clinical

All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be u sed for 
the analysis.  
A subject is considered  a ‘withdrawal’ from the study when no study procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.  
Inves tigators will make an attempt to contact those subjects who do not return for 
scheduled visits or follow -up.  
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF . The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the study was made by 
the subject  herself,  or by the investigator , as well as which of the following possible 
reasons was responsible for withdrawal:  
• Serious adverse event

site, omissions or inconsistencies  detecte d by subsequent eCRF review may necessitate 
clarification or correction of omissions or inconsistencies  with documentation and 
approval by the investigator or a ppropriately qualified designee . In all cases, the 
investigator remains accountable for the stud y data.  
The investigator will be provided with a CD -ROM of the final version of the data 
generated at the investigational site  once the database is archived and the study report is 
complete and approved by all parties . 
11.2.  Monitoring by GSK Biologicals  
Monito ring visits by a GSK Site Monitor are for the purpose of confirming that GSK 
Biologicals’ sponsored studies are being conducted in accordance with the ethical 
principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent 
with GC P and the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (verifying continuing compliance 
with the protocol, amendment(s), reviewing the investigational product accountability 
records, verifying that the site staff and facilities continue to be adequate to conduct t he 
study ).  
The investigator must ensure provision of reasonable time, space and qualified personnel 
for monitoring visits.  
Direct access to all study -site related and source data is mandatory for the purpose of 
monitoring review. The monitor will perform a RDE review and a Source Document 
Verification (SDV). By SDV we understand verifying RDE entries by comparing them 
with the source data that will be made available by the investigator for this purpose.  
The Source Documentation Agreement Form describes th e source data for the different 
data in the RDE. This document should be completed and signed by the site monitor and 
investigator and should be filed in the monitor’s and investigator’s study file. Any data 
item for which the RDE will serve as the source must be identified, agreed and 
documented in the source documentation agreement form.  
For RDE, the monitor will mark completed and approved screens at each visit.  
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and GSK procedures, GSK monitors 
will contac t the site prior to the start of the study to review with the site staff the protocol, 
study requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy regulatory, ethical, and GSK 
requirements. When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also 
include identification, agreement and documentation of data items for which the eCRF 
entries will serve as the source document.  
GSK will monitor the study to verify that , amongst others,  the:  
• Data are authentic, accurate, and complete . 
• Safety and rights o f subjects are being protected .

amendments, any other study agreements, GCP and all applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to 
allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents.  
Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study, the monitor will conduct site 
closure activities with the investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in acco rdance with 
applicable regulations, GCP, and GSK procedures.  
11.3.  Archiving of d ata at study sites  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all site study records in a 
safe and secure location. The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely 
retrieval, when needed ( e.g. audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any 
subsequent review of data in conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting 
systems, and staff. Where permitted by applicable laws/regulations or in stitutional policy, 
some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format other than hard copy 
(e.g. microfiche, scanned, electronic for studies with an eCRF); however, caution needs 
to be exercised before such action is taken. The investiga tor must assure that all 
reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the original  and meet 
accessibility and retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. 
Furthermore, the investigator must ensure there is an acce ptable back -up of these 
reproductions and that an acceptable quality control process exists for making these 
reproductions.  
GSK will inform the investigator/institution of the time period for retaining these records 
to comply with all applicable regulatory  requirements. However, the 
investigator/institution should seek the written approval of the sponsor before proceeding 
with the disposal of these records. The minimum retention time will meet the strictest 
standard applicable to that site for the study, as  dictated by ICH GCP, any institutional 
requirements or applicable laws or regulations, or GSK standards/procedures; otherwise, 
the minimum retention period will default to 15 years.  
The investigator/institution must notify GSK of any changes in the archi val 
arrangements, including, but not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility, 
transfer of ownership of the records in the event the investigator leaves the site.  
11.4.  Audits  
To ensure compliance  with GCP and all applicable regulatory requir ements, GSK may 
conduct a quality assurance audit. Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory 
inspection of this study. Such audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after 
completion of the study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the inve stigator and institution 
agree to allow th e auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate 
his/her time and the time of his/her staff to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and 
any relevant issues.

Since the double -blind study HPV -015 will be extended by a maximum of three 
additional years, according to Protocol Amendment 4, dated 24 March 2010 , it is 
important that central study staff involved in the studies remains blinded till the end of 
study HPV -015 for all subjects who have been participating in HPV -015 and will be 
participating in this study. Therefore, subjects enrolled in HPV -015 extension studies 
such as study HPV -067 cannot retain the HPV -015 subject number as is stated in the 
original protocol. Consequently, different identification numbers will be provided by 
an ex ternal statistician.

Rationale/background for changes:  
Due to their potent immune s timulating effect, there are theoretical concerns that 
modern adjuvants like GSK Biologicals' novel adjuvant systems might result in 
undesirable effects on the body's immune system, which could include onset of new or 
exacerbation of underlying autoimmune diseases in particular. Accordingly, a 
heightened surveillance on the occurrence of any such conditions in recipients of novel 
adjuvant containing vaccines in clinical trials has been put in place by GSK. Protocol 
amendment 1 was hence developed to impleme nt reporting of potential immune -
mediated diseases (pIMDs).  
In addition, the contributing authors, the contact information for Emergency Code 
Break and the formulation of the HPV -16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine  were updated.

However, the investigator will exercise h is/her medical and scientific judgement in 
deciding whether other immune -mediated diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. 
pathophysiology involving systemic or organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and 
should also be recorded as a pIMD.

13-JAN-2011  61 When there is enough evidence to make any of the above diagnoses, the AE must be 
reported as a pIMD. Symptoms, signs or conditions which might (or might not) 
represent the above diagnoses, should be recorded and reported as AEs but not as 
pIMDs until the final or definitive diagnosis has been determined, and alternative 
diagnoses have been eliminated or shown to be less likely.  
In order to facilitate the documentation of pIMDs in the eCRF, a pIMD standard 
questionnaire and a list of preferred terms (PTs) and PT codes corresponding to the 
above diagnoses will be available to investigators at study start.  
Section 8.3.1: Time period for detecting and recording adverse events, 
serious adverse events and pregnancies  
The standard time perio d for collecting and recording medically significant conditions 
will begin at the first receipt of study vaccine and will end 6 months following the 
administration of the last dose of study vaccine ( i.e. at study conclusion) for each 
subject. Medically sig nificant conditions should be recorded in the AE screen of the 
subjects eCRF  if they are non -serious and in the SAE screen of the subject’s eCRF if 
they are serious. When the medically significant condition is considered as a pIMD, it 
always has to be repo rted in the SAE screen of the subject’s eCRF.  See also Section  8.4 
for instructions on reporting of pIMDs.  
The standard time period for collecting and recording pregnancies will begin at the 
first receipt of study vaccine and will end 6 months following ad ministration of the last 
dose of study vaccine ( i.e. at study conclusion). See section  8.4 for instructions on 
reporting of pregnancies.  
The standard time period for collecting and recording SAEs will begin at the first

When additional information is received on a SAE after freezing of the subject's eCRF, 
new or updated information should be recorded on a SAE Repor t Form, with all 
changes signed and dated by the investigator. The updated form should be faxed to the 
GSK Biologicals Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department or to the Study

Section 8.4.4: Reporting of pIMDs to GSK Biologicals  
Once onset of a new pIMD or exacerbation of a pre -existing pIMD is diagnosed 
(serious or non -serious) in a study subject, the investigator (or designa te) must 
complete the information in the SAE screens of the eCRF WITHIN 24 HOURS after 
the he/she becomes aware of the diagnosis. A field on the SAE screen allows to specify 
that the event is a pIMD and whether it is serious or non serious. The SAE screens  will 
always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event, in 
accordance with the pIMD standard questionnaire provided. Even if the investigator 
does not have all information regarding a pIMD, the SAE screens should still be 
completed within 24 hours. Once additional relevant information is received, the SAE 
screens in the eCRF should be updated WITHIN 24 HOURS.  
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report.  
Refer to Secti ons 8.4.3.1 and 8.4.3.2 for back -up system and updating of SAE 
information after freezing of the subject's eCRF.

Amendment 6 Global  
The purpose of this amendment is to account for the COVID -19 pandemic and to minimize the 
risks to the patients in the study as well as healthcare providers by allowing flexibility in the visit 
schedule while social distancing suggestions are in place. All owing for this flexibility does not 
increase the risk of participating in this study as there will be continued contact between the 
patients and study personnel despite postponement of in -person clinic visits.  In addition, this 
amendment seeks to update t he planned analysis for Period 2 (open -label treatment period; week 56) based 
on the primary analysis results from Period 1 (double -blind, placebo -controlled period; week 28). These 
data prompted definition of a separate study hypothesis to “treatment with  REGN2477 prevents the 
formation of new HO lesion in patients with FOP” and addition of new endpoints to test this separate 
hypothesis for Period 2 (week 56)

CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3 Global  
Change and Rationale for Change  Section Changed  
The purpose of this amendment is to revise the protocol 
to reflect new safety information relating to a potential 
risk for epistaxis.  
In order to mitigate the potential risk for epistaxis, 
3 exclusion criteria were added:  
• #18 Patients who are on concomitant antiplatelet 
therapy (egg, clopidogrel), anti -coagulants 
(eg, warfarin, heparin, factor Xa inhibitor, or 
thrombin inhibitors) in the last 30  days or within 
5 half-lives of the therapy, whichever is longer.  
Low dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is 
acceptable.  
• #19 Patients with a history of severe, non-traumatic 
bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization for 
hemodynamic compromise  
• #20 Patients with a known pre -existing medical 
history of a bleeding diathesis (eg,  hemophilia A, 
von Willebrand’s Factor deficiency, platelet count 
≤20x109/L). 
As an additional mitigation strategy, investigators should 
discourage the use of anti -inflammatory drugs that inhibit 
platelet function or are otherwise associated with an 
increased risk of bleeding, to the extent possible.  
Clarified the Low dose acetylsalicyl ic acid (aspirin; 
[≤100  mg/day])  
To aid in the exclusion of patients who may have existing 
propensity for bleeding and to assess the effect of 
REGN2477 administration, baseline and post -treatment 
laboratory measures of coagulation parameters and 
platelet e ffector function were added.  
Added baseline exploratory research sample to explore 
mechanism of epistaxis and REGN2477 mechanism of 
action  
Added antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants, and herbal 
supplements (that inhibit platelet function or are 
associate d with increased risk of bleeding) to the list of 
prohibited medications  
To increase early detection of epistaxis or bleeding 
events, the following were added as adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs):  
• Moderate to severe episodes of non -traumatic 
bleeding 
• Moderate epistaxis (defined as any episode lasting 
longer than 30 minutes or requiring professional 
medical intervention)  
• Severe epistaxis (based on definition of a severe AE

in ACVR1 receptors transduced bone morp hogenic 
protein signaling when stimulated with Activin A.  These 
results indicate that REGN2477 may be effective for all 
FOP mutations.  This change expands the scope of the 
study to include patients with a clinical diagnosis of FOP 
who may have different ACVR1 mutations.   
To support interpretation of the study results, all patients 
will have their ACVR1 gene sequenced during the study 
(mandatory).   
The primary statistical analyses for the study will be based 
on the original study design, not the expanded  study 
population.   Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Study Design,

The statistical analysis was revised to address feedback 
from regulatory agencies, as well as addressing the 
changes related to inclusion of patients with ACVR1 
mutations:  
Use a hierarchical testing procedure instead of the 
Hochberg procedure. Revised Statistical Plan  
Specify hierarchical testing of the 4 efficacy primary 
endpoints  
Specify that the baseline active HO analysis set includes 
all randomized patients who had active HO  lesion at 
baseline  
Specify that patients will be randomized to REGN2477 or 
placebo in a 1:1 ratio by ACVR1 mutation (classic 
[R206H], other) in addition to gender and 
presence/absence of baseline active HO lesions.  
Specify that results are analyzed first  in patients with the 
ACVR1[R206H] mutation and secondly in patients with 
any ACVR1 mutation.

The study design was revised to allow pati ents who 
completed the open label portion of the study through 
week 52, to continue to receive study drug from week 56 
through week 76 or beyond.   
Changed “the 24 -week follow -up period” to the “follow -
up treatment period” (Period 3).  Each patient will 
continue to receive REGN2477 every 4 weeks during this 
period  until they complete the week 76 visit, and all data 
have been collected and validated through the time when 
the last patient randomized into the study completes the 
week 28 visit (Period 1), and  results of the primary 
analyses of safety and efficacy are available to the 
sponsor.  If at the time patients reach the week 76 visit 
but data from the last patient randomized into the study 
through the week 28 visit have not been collected and 
validated,  and results of the primary analyses of safety 
and efficacy are not yet available to the sponsor, patients 
will continue to receive REGN2477 every 4 weeks, 
beyond week 76.   
Patients will have the option to discontinue study 
medication before the beginning  or at any time during 
Period 3, similarly to what occurs at any time during the 
study after patients have signed the informed consent.   
Treatment with REGN2477 will continue provided that 
no safety signals are identified during continuous 
monitoring of t he study by the investigator, medical 
monitor and IDMC.  In addition, all patients will be 
required to maintain contraception during this period.  
Revised footnote #17 in the Schedule of Events, Table  3, 
as this footnote addressed the transition from 
on-treatment to off - treatment which is no longer relevant 
to the study.  
The deletion of this footnote caused footnote #19 for 
Daily Pain NRS and Daily FOP disease activity diary 
from Schedule of Events, Table 1 to be changed to 
footnote#18.  
Removed the post -treatment period as the third 
observation period, because treatment with REGN2477 
will continue during Treatment Follow -up (Period 3) 
through the end of the study.  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Study Design, Study

investigator will be allowed to independently read and 
analyze PET/CT images. Baseline PET/CT images will 
be performed before each patient is randomized into the 
study.  As these baseline images do not contain any 
unblinding data, the PI may util ize these images as part 
of standard of care resulting in not having to duplicate the 
imaging assessments and thereby reducing the patients’ 
total annual radiation exposure.  Section 8.2.2.1 Positron Emission

CONFIDENTIAL  CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study to  Assess the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Effects on Heterotopic Bone Formation of REGN2477 
in Patients with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva  
Site Location(s)  
 Principal Investigator  The study will be conducted at multiple sites globally  
TBD  
Objective(s)  Primary Objective:  
The primary safety objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability 
of REGN2477 in male and female patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans 
progressiva (FOP).  
The primary efficacy objective of the study is to assess the effect of 
REGN2477 versus placebo on the change from baseline in heterotopic 
ossification (HO) in patients with FOP, as determined by 18-NaF uptake in 
HO lesions by positron emission tomography (PET) and in total volume of 
HO lesions by computed tomography (CT).  
Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To compare the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on pain due to 
FOP, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) for pain based 
on daily numeric rating scale (NRS) scores  
• To assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on the change from 
baseline in HO, as determined by the number of new HO lesions 
identified by 18F-NaF PET or by CT  
• To assess the effect of REGN2477 versu s placebo on the change from 
baseline in 18F-NaF standardized uptake value maximum (SUV max) of 
individual active HO site (s) by PET  
• To assess the effect of REGN2477, between week 28 and week 56, on 
the number, activity, and volume of HO lesions identified by 18F-NaF 
PET or by CT in patients who switch from placebo to REGN2477 at 
week 28 versus the same patients between baseline and week 28  
• To assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on the change from 
baseline in biochemical markers of bone formation  
• To characterize the concentrations of total activin A at baseline and 
over time following the first dose of study drug  
• To characterize the concentration -time profile (pharmacokinetics 
[PK]) of REGN2477 in patients with FOP  
• To assess the immunogenicity of R EGN2477

CONFIDENTIAL  Study Design  This is a phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled, 2 -period study designed to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and effects on heterotopic bone formation 
of repeated doses of 10 mg/kg REGN2477 administered intravenously (IV), 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) in adult patients with FOP.  
Up to 40 patients with FOP disease activity may be enrolled at multiple sites 
globally to yield approximately 24 or more patients with the classic type I 
activin A receptor  with a R206H mutation (ACVR1[R206H]) a nd active HO 
at baseline as determined by 18F-NaF PET/CT.  
This study consists of a screening/baseline period (day -28 to day -1), 
2 treatment periods and a follow -up treatment period.  The 3  treatment periods 
are: 
• Period 1 : a 6-month randomized double -blind placebo -controlled 
treatment period  
• Period 2 : a 6-month open -label REGN2477 treatment period  
• Period 3 : a follow -up treatment period with REGN2477 continuing until 
patients have completed the week 76 visit, and all data have been 
collected and  validated through the time when the last patient randomized 
into the study completes the week 28 visit (Period 1), and results of the 
primary analyses of safety and efficacy are available to the sponsor.  
Patients who meet initial eligibility screening wil l have baseline procedures 
conducted.  
In light of the public health emergency related to the COVID -19 pandemic, 
the continuity of clinical study conduct and oversight may require 
implementation of temporary or alternative mechanisms.  Examples of 
alternati ve mechanisms may include, but are not limited to, any of the 
following:  phone contact, virtual visits, telemedicine visits, online meetings, 
non-invasive remote monitoring devices, use of local clinic or laboratory 
locations, and home visits by skilled s taff.  All temporary mechanisms 
utilized, and deviations from planned study procedures in response to 
COVID -19 are to be documented as being related to COVID -19 and will 
remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency and/or 
until the  COVID -19 pandemic is deemed manageable and no longer 
interfering with the conduct of trials at individual sites.  
During Period 1, patients will be randomized to receive REGN2477 at 
10 mg/kg dose or matching placebo, administered IV Q4W through week  24, 
for a total of 7 doses.  Randomization will be stratified by gender, by classic 
ACVR1[R206H] mutation/different ACVR1 mutations, and by 
presence/absence of baseline active HO lesions as determined by  18F-NaF 
PET/CT.  Index HO lesion identified at baseline an d new HO lesions will be 
assessed by imaging endpoint measures including whole body 18F-NaF PET 
and whole body low dose CT at week 8 (day 57 [±7 days]), and week 28 
(day 197 [±7 days]).  Serum samples for the determination of REGN2477 
concentrations and an ti-drug antibody (ADA) will be collected.  
To ensure safety, individual patients will be closely monitored and safety of 
each dose of study drug will be reviewed by the investigator and Regeneron 
medical monitor prior to administering the subsequent repeate d dose.  The 
safety review to be conducted by the investigator and Regeneron medical 
monitor prior to study drug infusions on visits 2, 5, 6 and 7 (Period 1) and 
visits 11, 12, 13 and 14 (Period 2) will include evaluation of laboratory test 
(hematology, bl ood chemistry and urinalysis) results collected as part of these 
visits.  For the remaining study visits, assessment of results of hematology, 
blood chemistry and urinalysis tests planned for these same visits may be 
performed, but will not be required pri or to study drug infusion. The decision

CONFIDENTIAL  not to wait for the results of these exams, processed at the study’s central 
laboratory, should be made on a case -by-case basis, if the patient’s clinical 
condition, adverse event profile, and assessment of vital sig ns, ECGs and 
previous laboratory test results indicate that the patient is suitable to receive 
the next dose of study drug.  For the study visits after week 56 (Period 3), the 
need for a safety review by the investigator and Regeneron medical monitor 
will be decided on a case -by-case basis. In addition, the Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will regularly monitor the unblinded safety 
data.  In the event that a significant tolerability issue or safety concern is 
identified, dose modification or st udy drug discontinuation may be 
implemented.  
All patients who complete the Period 1 double -blind treatment will receive 
REGN2477 open -label in Period 2, administered IV at a dose of 10  mg/kg 
Q4W through week  52, for a total of 7 doses.  For patients previ ously treated 
with placebo drug, week 28 (day 197) assessments will be considered as 
pretreatment baseline for safety and efficacy analysis of this period of the 
study.  Serum samples for the determination of REGN2477 concentrations 
and ADA will be collect ed. Index HO lesion identified at baseline and new 
HO lesions will be assessed by imaging endpoint measures including whole 
body 18F-NaF PET and whole body low dose CT at week 56 (day 393 [±7 
days]), and at week 76 (day 533 [±7 days]).  
In light of the publ ic health emergency related to the COVID -19 pandemic, 
Investigators may perform study visit 18 (week 56) imaging exam employing 
only whole body low -dose CT scans.  Assessment of imaging endpoints 
without the PET scan may be implemented to mitigate the dela y to acquire 
images due to the inaccessibility to PET/CT imaging centers and/or 
unavailability of the 18F-NaF tracer.  In addition, the timing for study visit 18 
(week 56) is flexible as long as any changes are documented.  This low -dose 
CT scan may be per formed by trained staff either at study site or at other 
clinical sites with access to a qualified CT scanner or using a mobile qualified 
CT scanner at a local community healthcare setting close to patient or at a 
home visit, contingent upon prior concurre nce and approval from the 
Investigator and Regeneron medical director.  Individual patient dose 
modification will be determined on a case -by-case basis as described in the 
protocol.  Study level dose modification will be determined by the sponsor 
upon reco mmendation of the IDMC following their review of safety, PK, and 
total activin A (target engagement) data available at the time.  
During the follow -up treatment period with REGN2477 (Period 3), from 
week  56 until the end of study, efficacy and safety procedures will be 
performed, and serum samples for the determination of REGN2477 
concentrations and ADA will be collected.  Each patient will continue to 
receive REGN2477, provided that no safety signals are identified during 
continuous monitoring of the study by the investigator, medical monitor and 
IDMC.  In addition, during this period, all patients will be required to maintain 
contraception.  
Study Duration  The duration of the double -blind treatment period (Period 1), and open -label 
treatment and assessment period (Period 2) for a patient is approximately 
56 weeks, excluding the screening period.  The follow -up treatment period 
will begin at week 56 and continue until patients have completed the week 76 
visit (Period 3), and all data have been coll ected and validated through the 
time when the last patient randomized into the study completes the week 28 
visit (Period 1), and results of the primary analyses of safety and efficacy are 
available to the sponsor.

CONFIDENTIAL  After Period 3 (week 76), patients can con tinue to receive REGN2477 
treatment every 4 weeks until any 1 of the following occurs: clinical 
development of REGN2477 is terminated, the risk -benefit is deemed 
unfavorable in this patient population, other means of access to REGN2477 
(eg, expanded access  protocol) becomes available for study patients for whom 
the benefit -risk assessment for REGN2477 treatment remains positive, or , 
approval of the drug by the competent regulatory authority governing each 
respective country (eg, European Commission for EU M ember States) with 
commercial availability.  A limited number of assessments for safety, 
efficacy, and clinical pharmacology parameters will be conducted.  
Population   
 Sample Size:  Up to 40 patients with FOP may be enrolled at multiple sites globally to yield 
approximately 24 or more patients with the classic ACVR1[R206H] mutation 
and active HO at baseline.  
 Target Population:  The study population will consist of male and female adult patients aged 18  to 
60 years of age, with a clinical diagnosis of FOP based on findings of 
congenital malformation of the great toes, episodic soft tissue swelling, and/or 
progressive HO, and confirmed with documentation of ACVR1 genotype, 
including the classic [R206H] or different ACVR1 mutations.  If at the time 
of screening, the patient does not have documentation of what ACVR1 
mutation he/she carries or it cannot be retrieved, genotyping will need to be 
performed prior to randomization.  Patients must have had FOP disease 
activity within 1  year of screening visit, defined as pain, swelling, stiffness, 
and other signs and symptoms associated with FOP flare -ups; or worsening 
of joint function, or radiographic progression of HOs (increase in size or 
number of HO lesions) with/without being associated with flare -up episodes.

Procedures and Assessments  Safety Assessments  
Safety procedures and assessments will include vital signs assessment, 
physical examination, a menstrual cycle history, electrocardiogram, and 
laboratory testing.  
ACVR1 Gene Sequencing  
A blood sample for future ACVR1 gene sequencing will be preferably 
collected from patients at the screening/baseline visit. However, it can be 
collected at any time during the study period, as the result of this test it is not 
to be used for assessment of study eligibility.   
Imaging Procedures  
Positron emission tomography with 18F-NaF and volumetric CT will be used 
to measure the change in heterotopic bone formation.  
Clinical Endpoint Measures  
Clinical endpoint measures will include the NRS categorical scal e of pain, the 
FOP disease activity assessment via patient diary, the patient reported FOP 
Independent Activity of Daily Living (FOP I -ADL) Questionnaire based on 
the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS), the Europol 5 dimensio ns questionnaire with a 3 -level scale (EQ -
5D-3L), the physician assessment of cumulative analog joint involvement 
scale (CAJIS) and spirometry assessment of pulmonary function.  
Biomarker Procedures  
Blood will be collected for the analysis and discovery of  biomarkers, 
including but not limited to biochemical bone formation markers (BSAP, tAP 
and P1NP), hs -CRP, as well as mechanism based biomarkers related to the 
activin A and activin receptor pathway including but not limited to Activin 
and BMP ligands or m arkers that may elucidate the mechanism of action of 
REGN2477, and whole blood RNA analysis.  Blood for a separate optional 
genomics sub -study will also be collected in patients who consent to analysis. 
This analysis will be an exploratory pharmacogenomics  analysis that may 
include genome wide analysis that is additional to the mandatory ACVR1 
gene sequencing noted above.

CONFIDENTIAL  Pharmacokinetic and Anti -Drug Antibody Assessments  
Serum samples for measurements of drug concentration, activin A 
concentration, and ADA  will be collected.  Any unused serum samples may 
be used for exploratory biomarker research or future biomedical research.  
Statistical Plan  Justification of Sample Size  
Randomization will be stratified by the presence/absence of active HO lesions 
at baseline, to allow analyses of efficacy endpoint measures defined solely for 
patients with active HO at baseline.  Patients without active HO lesions at 
baseline will contribute to the assessment of safety and other endpoint 
measures.  Randomization will a lso be stratified by gender and classic 
ACVR1[R206H] mutation/different ACVR1 mutations.  
The sample size estimation for at least 24 patients (12 patients per treatment 
group) with active HO at baseline and classic ACVR1[R206H] mutation is 
based on statisti cal considerations for the following efficacy endpoints: 
percent change from baseline in (1) total lesion activity by 18F-NaF PET over 
28 weeks, (2) total HO volume by CT at week 28, and (3) 18F-NaF SUV max at 
week 8.  Accounting for a 20% dropout rate at w eek 28, the sample size would 
yield approximately 10  patients per treatment group for week -28 analyses.  
This sample size will provide 80% power at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level 
in allowing the detection of an observed treatment difference in the order  of 
57%, 65%, and 40% reduction in the total lesion activity by 18F-NaF PET, the 
total HO volume by CT, and the 18F-NaF SUV max, respectively, if the measure 
variability in FOP patients is similar to that observed in other bone diseases 
and the FOP mouse mo del.  Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that different 
mutations in the ACVR1 receptor transduced BMP signaling when stimulated 
with activin A.  These results suggest that REGN2477 may provide beneficial 
clinical impact on HO in patients with FOP, irres pective of the underlying 
ACVR1 mutation.   
Statistical Hypotheses  
Hypothesis (Period 1 [Week 28])  
The following null and alternative hypotheses will be tested sequentially for 
the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints respectively:   
H0: No treatment di fference between REGN2477 and placebo  
H1: There is a treatment difference between REGN2477 and placebo  
Hypothesis (Period 2 [Week 56])  
For the Period 2 (week 56) analyses, the following primary and key secondary 
null hypotheses will be tested:  
H1,1: There is no difference in number of new (relative to week 28 scan) 
HO lesions as assessed by CT per patient at week 56 compared to the 
number of new (relative to baseline scan) HO lesions as assessed by CT 
per patient at week 28 in placebo/REGN2477 group in AHO (primary)

Statistical Methods  
Efficacy Analysis for Period 1 (Week 28)  
Percent change from baseline in targeted total lesion activity 18F -NaF PET at 
week 8 and 28 weeks will be analyzed in AHO or AHOC using a mixed -effect 
model with repeated measures (MMRM)  model.  The model will include 
treatment, gender, ACVR1 mutation type (AHO analysis set only) as fixed 
effects, time point, and treatment -by-time point interaction, as well as, the 
continuous fi xed covariates of baseline value and baseline value -by-time 
point interaction. An unstructured covariance matrix can be used in this model 
to account for within -patient correlation.  Time weighted average over 28 
weeks will be estimated from the model.  Different parameterization of 
MMRM model will be utilized if at least 1 patient is missing all post -baseline 
values. Because all the patients in AHO or AHOC have active HO at baseline, 
the stratification factor for baseline HO status will not be included in the 
model.  
Percent change from baseline in the total volume of HO lesions as assessed 
by CT at week 28  will be analyzed  in AHO or AHOC using  MMRM model. 
The model will include treatment, gender, ACVR1 mutation type as fixed 
effects, time point, and treatme nt-by-time point interaction, as well as, the 
continuous fixed covariates of baseline value and baseline value -by-time 
point interaction.  An unstructured covariance matrix can be used in this 
model to account for within -patient correlation.  Different par ameterization 
of MMRM model will be utilized if at least 1 patient is missing all post -
baseline values.  
Analysis of Time -weighted average (standardized AUC) change from 
baseline in daily pain due to FOP by the daily NRS over 28 weeks  will be 
performed in A HO or AHOC using the ANCOVA with treatment, gender, 
ACVR1 mutation type (AHO analysis set only) as factors , and the baseline 
value as continuous covariate.  
In order to handle multiple testing of the 4 primary and 2 key secondary 
efficacy endpoints, hierar chical testing procedure will be applied at a 2 -sided 
5% significance level.  Hypothesis for the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoint will be formally tested only if hypothesis for the preceding endpoint 
is significant at the 2 -sided 5% level.  The order of testing sequence for 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints is as follows:

No further multiplicity adjustments will be made for testing other secondary 
efficacy endpoints and exploratory endpoints where  nominal p -values will be 
provided for descriptive purpose.  
Efficacy Analysis for Period 2 (Week 56)  
These analyses are new and independent from that of Period 1 and warrant 
their own overall 2 -sided type I error rate of 10% (alpha of 0.1) which is 
consistent with regulatory guidance for studies in rare diseases.  The small 
inflation of alpha is also nece ssary to handle the possibility of patients with 
missing week 56 imaging assessment due to COVID -19.  
The type -I error rate will be controlled at 0.10 for the primary and key 
secondary null hypotheses in Period 2 (week 56).  To control the type -I error 
rate for the primary and key secondary endpoints in Period 2 (week 56), a 
hierarchical testing procedure will be applied at a 2 -sided 10% significant 
level to test the above hypotheses in the specified order.  The key secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be test ed only if statistical significance is established 
for the primary endpoint.  No further adjustments will be made for other 
secondary and exploratory endpoints in Period 2 (week 56), for which 
estimates, 95% CI, and/or nominal p -values will be provided for  descriptive 
purpose.  
The COVID -19 pandemic has affected the conduct of the study mainly by 
causing delay in dose administration, delay in the collection of the PET/CT 
scans due to site closure, and unavailability of 18F-NaF due to interruption of 
tracer p roduction. Some patients may not be able to complete their week 56 
scans within the protocol -specified visit window and may only be able 
complete their scans using CT -only modality.

CONFIDENTIAL  The week 56 efficacy analyses  of imaging endpoints will be conducted usi ng 
COVID -19 modified Intent -To-Treat (COVID -19 mITT) principle which will 
analyze only those patients for whom:  
• at least 1 post -week 28 scan is collected and,  
• the time period between any 2 consecutive doses is less than 
9 weeks (63 days) in Period 2 and,  
• no more than 1 dose was missed in Period 2  
This will ensure that primary analyses for imaging endpoints will include 
patients with continuous saturating levels of REGN2477.  For patients whose 
week 56 scans are delayed, the first delayed scan available aft er the week 28 
scan will be used to impute the week 56 data in the primary analyses. In the 
absence of a PET/CT scan, data from available CT -only scans will be used to 
analyze the primary endpoint and other secondary imaging endpoints, if 
applicable. This imputation ensures that the estimation of the treatment effect 
will not be biased by the COVID -19 pandemic.

Primary and Additional Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  
Primary analysis of safety and efficacy data of the randomized double -blind 
placebo -controlled period (Period  1) of the study will be performed once all 
data have been collected and validated through the end of this period 
(Period  1, week 28; database lock [DBL] 1).  Additional analyses of safety 
and efficacy data will be performed following the open -label REGN2477 
period (Period  2; week 56; DBL 2), and at the end of the follow -up treatment 
period at week 76 (Period 3, Week 76; DBL 3 ).  Since the key efficacy 
measure data collection for Period 1 will have been concluded at the time of 
the first analysis (Period 1, week 28; DBL 1) and the radiographic data for 
subsequent periods had not been read nor entered into the database, the fina l 
analysis for Period 1 is not considered an interim analysis for subsequent 
periods and no multiplicity adjustments are needed.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
REGN2477 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and blocks signaling 
of activin A.  REGN2477 is being developed for the treatment of fibrodysplasia  ossificans 
progressiva (FOP), an ultra -rare genetic disorder affecting approximately 800 patients worldwide.  
Characteristics of FOP include progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) of skeletal muscle, 
ligaments, tendons, and fascia, which leads to joint  immobility, significant disability, pain and 
premature death ( Kaplan 2010 , Aleman -Meunch 2012 , Hüning 2014 ).  There is no approved 
treatment for the preven tion or reversal of HO associated with FOP.  Fibrodysplasia ossificans 
progressiva appears to be caused by mutations in the region encoding for the intracellular domain 
of type I activin A receptor (ACVR1) with the most common mutation observed in patients  being 
ACVR1[R206H] ( Hüning 2014 ).  Recent studies in a conditional -inducible mouse model of FOP 
have demonstrated that the ACVR1[R206H] variant drives HO by conferring to the receptor the 
abnormal ability to recognize activi n A as an agonistic ligand resulting in abnormal bone formation 
similar to the clinical condition ( Hatsell  2015 ).  In this model, exogenous activin A drives 
exuberant HO activity and REGN2477 administration dramatically halt s heterotopic bone 
formation.  In vitro studies demonstrated that different mutations in the ACVR1 receptor 
transduced bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling when stimulated with activin A 
(Hino  2015 ).  These results indicate  that REGN2477 may suppress HO for patients with FOP who 
have ACVR1 mutations other than ACVR1[R206H].  Taken together, these data suggest that 
REGN2477 may be an effective treatment for FOP  irrespective of the underlying ACVR1 
mutation . 
This study (R2477 -FOP-1623 LUMINA -1) is designed to test the hypotheses that 1)  REGN2477 
is generally well tolerated and 2)  REGN2477 inhibits HO in patients with FOP. Positron emission 
tomography (PET) with 18F-NaF and volumetric computed tomography (CT) will be used to 
measure the change in heterotopic bone formation.  18F-NaF PET has been shown in several other 
disease settings to provide a sensitive, specific, and whole body quantitative measure of bone 
mineralization activity.  The use of 18F-NaF PET and other imaging mo dalities, such as 
Technetium -99 (99mTc) bone scan, are able to detect HO lesions in FOP patients ( Eekhoff  2016 , 
Fang 1986 , Herford 2003 , Trikha 2005 , Tulchinsky 2007 ).  In the Regeneron mouse model of 
inducible FOP, HO lesions have been shown to be detectable by 18F-NaF PET and HO activities 
in these lesions are markedly dimini shed following treatment with REGN2477 (see the 
Investigator’s Brochure [IB]).  It is hypothesized that use of 18F-NaF PET may allow an assessment 
of treatment effect in a relatively small number of patients as early as 8 weeks after treatment 
initiation a nd may be the most sensitive modality to quantify total change in HO activity during 
the 6 -month treatment time planned for Period 1 of this study.  Because this modality has not been 
previously studied in patients with FOP, this study also plans an assess ment of change in the total 
volume of HO (as assessed by quantitative CT) over the 6  month treatment interval as well as a 
change in the number of new lesions during this period (as assessed by 18F-NaF PET and CT).  
Additional endpoints captured in this st udy will include changes in biochemical biomarkers of 
bone turnover and changes in clinical measures for joint function and patient reported disease 
activity and activities of daily living. Patients with FOP describe pain associated with their disease, 
at times refractory to analgesic treatments.  Pain severity will be assessed daily in this study 
through the Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS).

CONFIDENTIAL  This study plans to enroll up to 40 adult male and female FOP patients to ensure inclusion of 
approximately 24 or mo re patients with the classic [R206H] ACVR1 mutation and active HO 
lesion detectable by 18F-NaF PET at baseline to allow the assessment of change from baseline 
treatment effects on key efficacy endpoints of heterotopic bone formation.  The protocol 
amendmen t 1 expands the scope of patient eligibility by opening enrollment to patients with a FOP 
diagnosis and documentation of any ACVR1 mutation.  During the study, all patients will have 
their ACVR1 gene sequenced as part of the study.  The study will consist of 3 treatment periods.  
The first period (Period 1) will be a 6 -month randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
treatment period evaluating changes from baseline in HO by 18F-NaF PET and CT at 8  weeks and 
6 months.  The second period (Period 2) will be  a 6-month open -label treatment period, during 
which all patients in the study will be treated with REGN2477.  Patients previously treated with 
placebo will be crossed over to REGN2477 to allow for an assessment of a 6 -month treatment 
effect; patients prev iously on REGN2477 will be treated with REGN2477 for an additional 
6 months to allow for an assessment of a 12 -month treatment effect.  The third period (Period 3) 
will be a follow -up treatment period during which all patients in the study will continue to  be 
treated with REGN2477 at monthly visits until the patients have completed the week 76 visit, and 
all data have been collected and validated through the time when the last patient randomized into 
the study completes the week 28 visit (Period 1), and res ults of the primary analyses of safety and 
efficacy are available to the sponsor.  The patients who reach the week 76 visit will continue 
REGN2477 treatment consistent with Regeneron corporate policy governing access to 
investigational drugs in confirmator y clinical studies (Section  5.1.4 ).  Patients will have the option 
to discontinue study medication before the beginning or at any time during Period 3, similarly to 
what occurs at any time during the study.  The proposed dose regimen is 10 mg/kg, given 
intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks (Q4W).  
The LUMINA -1 study is currently ongoing, and all patients have completed Period 1 
(double -blind, placebo -control led period; see the IB).  The results from the primary analysis of 
efficacy in Period 1 of the LUMINA -1 study demonstrated clinical benefit of REGN2477 for the 
treatment of FOP by markedly reducing the number of new heterotopic bone lesions as assessed 
by both18F-NaF PET and CT (see Section  3.3.1 ).  These results refined our understanding of the 
pathophysiology of FOP and the role of activin A in the di sease.  Together with the understanding 
of the genetics of this disease and with the complementary preclinical animal model data, the 
clinical data from the primary analysis of LUMINA -1 indicate that activin A is required for the 
formation of new lesions i n patients with FOP but does not seem to play a major role in the 
progression of existing lesions by PET or CT.  Moreover, these data demonstrate that REGN2477 
provides improvement on clinically meaningful endpoints, ie, formation of new HO bone lesions 
and inhibition of flare -up episodes for this disease.  
Treatment with REGN2477 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile (see the IB).  During 
Period  1 (the 28 -week double -blind treatment period), the majority of treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) were  mild to moderate in severity.  Notable imbalances in TEAEs for the 
REGN2477 group included Epistaxis, Acne, Madarosis, and a composite of skin and soft tissue 
infections including Abscess, Folliculitis, and Cellulitis.  A pathophysiologic explanation for these 
adverse events (AEs) has not been identified, although with respect to epistaxis, data to date 
suggest that REGN2477 does not inhibit platelet number, function, or clotting activity 
(see Section  3.4.3  and Section  3.4.4 ).

3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE   
3.1. Hypothesis:  Period 1 Double -Blind, Placebo -Control Treatment 
Period (Week 28)  
Prior to the conduct of this LUMINA -1 study, the hypothesis was that activin A is required for the 
formation and progression of new and existing active HO.  By blocking activin A, there was an 
expectation that compared to placebo, REGN2477 would show a mar ked reduction of HO (on both 
existing target lesions identified at baseline and new lesions that might develop after baseline). 
This effect would be evidenced by decreases in 18F-NaF PET uptake into existing active lesions 
and inhibition of the growth of h eterotopic bone lesions by volumetric CT.  
The hypotheses were:  
1. REGN2477 is generally well -tolerated in patients with FOP  
2. Treatment with REGN2477 reduces HO in patients with FOP   
3.2. Hypothesis:  Period 2 Open -Label Period (Week 56)  
Results from the prespecifi ed primary efficacy analysis from Period 1 (28 -week, double -blind 
period) have indicated that REGN2477 prevents occurrence of new HO lesions (see the IB).   
Upon analysis of the results of time weighted average of percent change from baseline in total 
lesion activity by PET through week 28 and percent change from baseline in total volume of HO 
by CT at week 28, it became clear that the overall reduction of these measures observed in patients 
treated with the REGN2477 compared to those treated with placebo w as mainly driven by an 
approximately 90% decrease in the number of new lesions, as detected by both PET and CT.  The 
quantification of new lesions by each modality was highly concordant with one another.

CONFIDENTIAL  These results support a new hypothesis:  
1. Treatment  with REGN2477 prevents the formation of new HO in patients with FOP  
3.3. Rationale  
3.3.1.  Rationale for Clinical Development of REGN2477 for FOP  
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a devastating ultra -rare autosomal dominant genetic 
disease for which there is  no effective treatment currently.  It is caused by mutations in the ACVR1 
gene (also known as ALK2, Shore 2006 ).  Preclinical data generated at Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) provide strong rationale for evaluati ng REGN2477, an anti -
activin A antibody, for the treatment of this disease.  
The FOP disease is characterized by childhood onset and life -long episodic and progressive HO 
in soft tissues, which can lead to joint immobility, skeletal deformity, and severe di sability.  Early 
mortality is common, often in the fifth decade, principally due to cardiorespiratory failure from 
thoracic insufficiency syndrome.  Disease flare -up episodes, often reported by patients as acute 
onset of painful or non -painful soft tissue swelling, joint stiffness, or loss of joint mobility, are not 
predictable in their occurrence, are variable in severity and duration (from days to many months), 
and do not always result in HO ( Pignolo 2016 , Kaplan 2016 ).  Pain associated with FOP disease 
activity may be severe and even refractory to opioid analgesics.   Heterotopic bone formation and 
disability may develop insidiously without acute flare -up symptoms ( Pignolo  2016 ).  Bone 
scintigraphy and the more sensitive and specific 18F-NaF PET method readily detect multiple focal 
HO lesions with abnormally high uptake of bone homing tracers in body regions where patients 
with FOP repor t experiencing flare -up symptoms and in regions without symptoms ( Fang 1986 , 
Herford 2003 , Trikha 2005 , Tulchinsky 2007 , Eekhoff 2016 ).  There are currently no effective 
treatments to prevent or inhibit HO in patients with FOP.  Surgical attempts to remove the 
heterotopic bone in patients with FOP result in more aggressive episodes of HO and are rare ly 
conducted.  Disease flare -ups are typically treated with high doses of glucocorticoids or non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory medications; however, these agents have not been shown to affect the 
course of HO.  
Regeneron has developed a murine model of FOP th at conditionally expresses the most common 
mutation variant of ACVR1, ACVR1[R206H], which is seen in patients with FOP, and recreates 
key features of the human disease.  This animal model displays heterotopic bone formation in soft 
tissues, spontaneously o r following tissue injury, and exacerbation following surgical resection of 
bony lesions.  In this model, blockade of activin A by REGN2477 not only prevented the onset of 
HO if given prophylactically prior to induction of HO, but also halted the progressi on of pre -
existing HO if given as a treatment after HO has been induced ( Hatsell 2015 , see IB).  Recent in 
vitro studies demonstrated that different mutations in the ACVR1 receptor transduced BMP 
signaling when stimulated wi th activin A ( Hino  2015 ).  These data indicate that REGN2477 may 
suppress HO for patients with FOP who have ACVR1 mutations other than ACVR1[R206H].  
Taken together, these results suggest that REGN2477 may provide beneficial cl inical impact on 
HO in patients with FOP, irrespective of the underlying ACVR1 mutation.   Preclinical imaging 
data support the use of both 18F-NaF PET and CT to follow disease progression and treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL  The LUMINA -1 study is currently ongoing, and all pat ients have completed Period 1 
(double -blind, placebo -controlled period).  The study database for the analysis of Period 1 was 
locked (19 Nov 2019 for clinical results and 13 Dec 2019 for imaging results).  The results of the 
primary efficacy and safety ana lysis for Period 1, after adult patients received 7  monthly infusions 
of either REGN2477 or placebo with at least 28  weeks of follow -up, showed that REGN2477 
reduced average total lesion activity (by 18F-NaF PET) from baseline over 28  weeks by 
approximatel y 25% (LS mean difference) compared to placebo (p=0.0741; see IB for details).  
Correspondingly, there was an approximate 25% (LS  mean difference) decrease in bone lesion 
volume (both new and existing lesions) compared to placebo as measured by CT (p=0.373 ).  These 
results were largely driven by marked decreases of nearly 90% in the incidence of new lesions 
irrespective of imaging modality (p<0.01).  The percent of patients who developed 1 or more new 
HO lesions as assessed by PET was lower in the REGN2477 treatment group (3 of 20  patients 
[15%]) as compared to placebo (11 of 24 patients [45.8%]) through week 28 (prespecified 
p=0.050).  Similarly, the percent of patients who developed new HO lesions as assessed by CT 
was again lower in the REGN2477 treatment  group (3 of 20 patients [15%]) compared to placebo 
(11 of 24  patients [45.8%]) through week 28 (post -hoc p=0.050).  The identification of lesions as 
"new" versus "existing" at baseline was specified in the imaging charter.  Taken together, these 
results i ndicate that while REGN2477 has a relatively modest treatment effect on the attenuation 
of existing lesions, there was a large effect preventing the occurrence of new lesions.  
In addition, an analysis to compare low -dose CT -only and PET/CT reads on new HO  lesions from 
the LUMINA -1 study was performed by the Sponsor.  Low -dose CT -only reads (ie, in the absence 
of PET scan) were performed by 2 new independent blind readers and a new blinded adjudicator.  
The readers and adjudicator assessments were entered i nto a separate electronic data capture 
(EDC) system.  The CT -only reads and lesion quantification were carried out following the same 
procedures described in the Imaging Review Charter.  
This analysis to compare the performance between PET/CT and low -dose CT-only showed there 
was no marked difference detected in the performance between PET/CT and CT reads (p=0.75). 
Specifically, the CT -only reading methodology reconfirmed the REGN2477 treatment effects on 
number or percentage of patients with new lesions, t otal number of new lesions, and volume of 
new lesions seen by the primary PET/CT reading methodology.  Thirty -eight new lesions were 
identified by the CT -only reads and 30 new lesions were identified by the PET/CT reads.  Only 
1 lesion out of 38 new lesion s identified by the CT -only reads was in REGN2477 group, and 3 out 
of 30 new lesions identified by the PET/CT reads were in REGN2477 group.  
Additional to the data indicating that activin A mostly serves to initiate the biologic events that 
ultimate result in heterotopic bone formation, the incidence of patient -reported flare ups was also 
reduced by 50% (prespecified p=0.032), while investigator -reported AEs of flare ups were 10% 
for REGN2477 and 42% for placebo (post -hoc p=0.039).  A favorable trend for red uced daily 
average pain as measured by NRS was seen in the REGN2477 groups compared to placebo.  
These data have prompted the definition of separate study hypotheses for the open -label treatment 
period (week 28 to week 56; Section  3.2) and addition of endpoints consistent with these 
hypotheses to confirm the efficacy of REGN2477 in preventing the formation of new HO and 
reducing flare -ups (Section  4.3).  
Further details of REGN2477 clinical data and preclinical data to support clinical development 
may be found in the IB.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.3.2.  Rationale for Study Design  
The study population will consist of adult male and female patients with FOP who are 18 to 
60 years old with documentation of any ACVR1 mutation and a recent history of active disease or 
HO progression as assessed by their treating physician within the last y ear.  All patients with FOP 
who enroll in the study will have a blood sample collected for sequencing of their ACVR1 gene 
during the study.  This information will support interpretation of the study results.   
Up to 40 FOP patients with or without current flare-up activities may be enrolled and randomized 
1:1 to REGN2477 or placebo treatment initially.  We estimate that at least 60% of FOP patients 
will have at least 1 active HO lesion, detected by 18F-NaF PET/CT at baseline.  Enrollment of up 
to 40 patient s is expected to yield approximately 24 or more patients with the classic 
ACVR1[R206H] mutation and active HO at baseline.  Randomization will be stratified by 
presence/absence of baseline active HO lesions, to allow change from baseline analyses of key 
efficacy endpoint measures such as 18F-NaF uptake in HO lesions.  Patients without baseline active 
HO lesions will contribute to the assessment of safety and other endpoint measures such as 
development of new HO lesions.  Randomization will also be stratifie d by gender and  classic 
ACVR1[R206H] mutation/different ACVR1 mutations . 
As there is no effective treatment for this severe rare disease, which often has a variable and 
insidious course, a placebo -controlled study is appropriate and will allow longitudinal  
documentation of disease activity and progression in both treatment groups in a blinded fashion to 
rigorously assess efficacy and safety of REGN2477.  The 1:1 randomization ratio serves to 
minimize potential erroneous conclusions due to imbalance between the 2 treatment groups, and 
limits the number of patients exposed to REGN2477 until initial safety is established.  
No active comparator is being considered because there is no effective therapy for this disease.  
Patients in both groups will be allowed to  receive standard of care therapies, including 
glucocorticoids and analgesics as needed for symptomatic management of the disease.  Treatment 
difference in use of glucocorticoids and analgesics will be exploratory endpoints in this study.  
Bisphosphonates,  which are sometime prescribed to patients with FOP, will not be allowed during 
the study, as these drugs are known to affect bone biomarkers and 18F-NaF uptake by the normal 
skeleton.  Also, denosumab, imatinib and isotretinoin should not be prescribed to  study patients as 
these drugs may affect skeletal bone turnover.   
This study is designed as a 3 -period study, with an initial 6 -month randomized double -blind 
placebo -controlled treatment period (Period 1), a subsequent 6 -month open -label REGN2477 
treatment period (Period 2) for all patients in the study, and a follow -up treatment period (Period  3) 
with continued use of REGN2477.  
The 6 -month duration of Period 1 was chosen based on our current knowledge of HO progression 
in FOP as assessed by the co -primary and key secondary imaging endpoints measures.  Cross -
Sectional and longitudinal 18F-NaF PET data in a small number of FOP patients showed 
abnormally high levels of 18F-NaF uptake at multiple heterotopic locations and that detection of 
new HO lesio ns by PET was highly sensitive and preceded that by CT.  In these patients, PET 
detectable lesions progressed to CT detectable calcified bony lesions in approximately 6 months, 
and often resulted in functional limitations ( Eekhoff 2016 ; for more details see Section  3.3.3.1 ).  
Based upon observation of 99mTc bone scans as well as18F-NaF PET from FOP patients, it is 
anticipated that a majority of the patients (more than 60%) in this planned study will have at lea st

CONFIDENTIAL  1 active lesion which will demonstrate increased 18F-NaF uptake (as measured by maximum 
SUV max) at baseline.  Without treatment, 18F-NaF uptake in an individual lesion decreases within 
6 months, as bone fully calcifies and becomes visible on CT.  Theref ore, to observe a change from 
baseline treatment effect of lesions active by PET at baseline, we chose an early time point of 
8 weeks post -treatment.  This early time point is expected to allow sufficient time for drug action 
in tissue, while permitting a distinction of the effect of the drug from that of the natural HO bone 
maturation process.  It is expected, however, that HO is a dynamic process in these patients and 
that without treatment, patients would have a number of lesions which would wax and wane  during 
a 6-month period of time whereas an effective therapy which inhibits HO activity would decrease 
this activity.  For this reason, a co -primary endpoint measure in this study will be the Total Lesion 
Activity (sum of 18F-NaF uptake in all active HO l esions by PET) from baseline through 6 months 
to allow for detection of treatment effects on both existing lesions and new lesions.  Volumetric 
assessment of HO lesions by CT over 6 months will also allow assessment of growth of HO lesions 
and transition o f PET detectable lesions to CT detectable mature HO lesions.  
Based on patient reports, FOP patients experience an average of 2 flare -ups per year, with a sub -
set of flare -ups leading to HO. However, HO has also been reported without being preceded by 
flare-ups ( Pignolo 2016 ). Therefore, we anticipate that, in the absence of treatment, a number of 
new HO lesions will develop over the 6 -month treatment period. The Total Lesion Activity (sum 
of 18F-NaF uptake in all active HO le sions by PET) from baseline through 6  months allows 
detection of treatment effects on both existing lesions and new lesions.  
After completion of Period 1 (the 6 -month double -blind placebo controlled period), patients will 
enter Period 2, during which all patients will be treated open -label for 6 months with REGN2477 
but will remain blinded to their previous treatment assignment.  Those patients who had been in 
the placebo group in Period 1 will be crossed over to REGN2477 treatment in Period 2, thereby 
allowing all patients participating in this study to contribute to the evaluation of REGN2477 safety 
and efficacy.  Patients who had been in the REGN2477 group in Period 1 will be treated with 
REGN2477 for an additional 6 months in Period 2 to provide an asse ssment of a 12 -month 
treatment effect.  
At the end of the Period 2, patients will continue to be treated with REGN2477 monthly during 
the follow -up treatment period (Period 3) until patients have completed the week  76 visit, and all 
data have been collected  and validated through the time when the last  patient randomized into the 
study completes the week 28 visit (Period 1), and results of the primary analyses of safety and 
efficacy are available to the sponsor.  If at the time patients reach the week 76 visi t data from the 
last patient randomized into the study through the week 28 visit have not been collected and 
validated, and results of the primary analyses of safety and efficacy are not yet available to the 
sponsor, patients will continue to receive REGN2 477 Q4W beyond week 76.  During this follow -
up treatment period (Period 3), each patient will continue to receive REGN 2477 provided that no 
safety signals are identified during continuous monitoring of the study by the investigator, medical 
monitor and In dependent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).  In addition, during this period, all 
patients will be required to maintain contraception use.  Patients will have the option to discontinue 
study medication at any time during Period 3, similarly to what occurs at any time during the study 
after patients have signed the informed consent.

CONFIDENTIAL  3.3.3.  Rationale for Efficacy Endpoint Measures (Period 1; Week 28)  
Heterotopic ossification is the key clinical feature of FOP and the primary cause of immobility, 
disability, pain, an d early mortality. Therefore, our choices of efficacy endpoint measures are 
aimed at allowing a rapid and sensitive assessment of the potential drug effect of inhibiting activin 
A on heterotopic bone formation.  
3.3.3.1.  18F-NaF Positron Emission Tomography  
The 18F-NaF PET imaging will be utilized in this study to assess active HO lesions (lesions with 
rapid mineralization in a period of active growth compared to normotopic skeleton and HO lesions 
that have matured and no longer grow) at baseline, week 8, week 28, we ek 56, and week  76.  The 
inherent quantitative nature of this imaging modality and our understanding of the biology of HO 
progression in FOP provide the rationale and we intend to qualify this endpoint measure during 
this study.  
18F-NaF is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved PET tracer widely used to detect 
abnormal osteogenic activity in several bone pathologies such as Paget’s disease, ankylosing 
spondylitis, and osteoblastic bone metastases ( Grant 2008 ).  When combined with CT, 18F-NaF 
PET has a sensitivity and specificity of >90% for the detection of osteoblastic metastases 
(Even -Sapir 2006 ).  Following IV administration, 18F-NaF is rapidly cleared from the plasma int o 
the skeleton and binds to bone at a high rate, leading to an elevated target -to-background ratio 
signal ( Blake 2012 , Even -Sapir 2006 ).  Uptake of 18F-NaF is concentrated at sites of high 
osteoblastic activity where the 18F ions bind to the newly mineralizing bone in a manner 
proportional to the apposition rate of bone, as shown by double tetracycline labeling studies in a 
porcine model ( Piert 2001 ).  Due to the inherent quantitative capability of PET, 18F-NaF imaging 
provides an objective, non -invasive measure that is proportional to the rate of bone formation.  
18F-NaF PET/CT has been used in monitoring treatment effects on bone in other diseases. For 
example, i n a study of 14 patients with Paget’s disease, the SUV max and tracer bone incorporation 
rate (K i) were found to be significantly higher in Pagetic bone than in normal bone 
(35.07±23.86  vs. 7.15±4.76 and 0.114±0.115 vs. 0.014±0.008 mL/min/mL, respectively, 
mean  ± standard deviation [SD], p<0.05 for both measures). Following treatment with 
bisphosphonates under various regiments from single IV injection to daily oral administration 
significant reduction of PET signal in Pagetic bone was observed compared to b aseline 
(-27.84±24.59 at 1 month and -44.64±23.61% at 6 months, p<0.05 at both time points) 
(Installe  2005 ). 
Pilot studies ( Eekhoff 2016 ) in a small number (N=4) of FOP patients evaluated by whole body 
18F-NaF PET scan showed all patients had metabolically active HO lesions, with elevated 18F-NaF 
uptake above the background levels of surrounding soft tissue and normal mature bone 
(Win 2014 ). Though there is limited data with this specific imaging modality, other bone scan data 
using 99mTc, which also detects bone mineralization, have demonstrated uptake in areas of HO in 
patients with FOP ( Fang 1986 , Herfo rd 2003 , Trikha 2005 , Tulchinsky 2007 ). Collectively, these 
results are consistent with those observed in the FOP mouse model with the ACVR1[R206H] 
mutation, which showed that the areas of active HO demonstrate abnormally high uptake of 18F-
NaF on PET. In these mice, administration of REGN247 7 inhibits heterotopic bone formation and 
markedly decreases 18F-NaF PET uptake in HO lesions (see IB). It is thus hypothesized that 
normalization in 18F-NaF uptake in pre -existing active HO lesions or a reduction in the number of 
                                        VV-RIM-00123469-1.0 Approved - 28 Aug 2020 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  new active HO lesions in patients treated with REGN2477, compared with those treated with 
placebo, can provide evidence of a “proof of concept” for the treatment effect of REGN2477 on 
HO activity and that eventually this effect will translate into a reduction in HO lesions as dete cted 
by CT.  Time -weighted percent change (AUC analysis) from baseline in Total Lesion Activity 
by18F-NaF PET to week 28 compared to placebo is chosen as 1 of the co -primary efficacy 
endpoints to assess the drug effect on heterotopic bone formation activit y in existing and new 
lesions.  
3.3.3.2.  Quantitative Whole Body CT  
Percent change from baseline in the total volume of HO lesions as assessed by CT at week 28 
compared to placebo is chosen as another of the co -primary efficacy endpoints, to allow 
assessment of grow th of HO lesions.  
In the FOP mouse model, microCT was also used to demonstrate the treatment effects of 
REGN2477.  In this model, REGN2477 prevented new HO lesion development and halted 
progression of existing HO lesions (see the IB for more detail).  Alth ough there are no published 
longitudinal natural history data on the change of HO lesion volume, it is known that new areas of 
HO in patients with FOP are detectable by CT in 3 to 6 months following tissue trauma, flare -up, 
or surgical procedures ( Eekhoff 2016 , Kaplan 2016 , Kitoh 2013 ).  Thus, it is anticipated that a 
treatment effect may be observed by CT in a 6 -month time -frame.  This study will also assess the 
treatment effect of REGN2477, as compared with placebo, on number of new HO lesions, in 
addition to changes in HO lesion volume by CT at 28  weeks.  Without treatment, active HO  lesions 
that are detectable by the very sensitive  18F-NaF PET measure at baseline  are expected to coalesce 
over time into mature HO lesions that will be detectable by CT.  Therefore, a treatment effect may 
be discernable by comparing the number of new CT detectable HO  lesions in REGN2477 -treated 
patients versus placebo -treated patients . 
3.3.4.  Rationale for Efficacy Endpoints (Period 2; Week 56)  
All patients remaining in the study have transitioned to the open -label REGN2477 treatment 
periods, Periods 2 (Section  5.1.3 ) and Period 3  (Section  5.1.4 ).   
The switch of patients in the placebo group to REGN2477 treatment will allow the confirmation 
of the study hypothesis for Period 2 (Section  3.2) that REGN2477 treatment leads to the prevention 
of new heterotopic bone formation compared to control.  The "control" is the experience of these 
same patients during the preceding placebo treat ment period (Period 1).  New HO related primary 
endpoint and key secondary endpoints will be evaluated in Period 2 (week 56; Section  4.3).  These 
analy ses are new and  independent from that of Period 1 and warrant their own overall type I error 
rate of 10% (alpha of 0.1) which is consistent with regulatory guidance for studies in rare diseases.  
The small inflation of alpha is also necessary to handle the possibility of patients with missing 
week 56 imaging assessment due to COVID -19 (Section  10.4.3.2.4 ).  The previously specified HO 
related secondary e ndpoints  will also be assessed in Period 2 (week 56).  Additionally, assessment 
of the patients who continue REGN2477 treatment from Period 1 (double -blind period) will allow 
the confirmation of the persistence of effect of REGN2477 in reducing new heterot opic bone 
formation with the continued REGN2477 treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL  In light of the public health emergency related to the COVID -19 pandemic, announced by the 
World Health Organization on 11 March 2020, Investigators may perform study visit 18 (week  56) 
and/or vi sit 23 (week 76) imaging exams employing only whole -body low -dose CT scans. 
Assessment of the imaging endpoints without the PET scan may be implemented to mitigate the 
delay to acquire images due to the inaccessibility to PET/CT imaging centers and/or unav ailability 
of the 18F-NaF tracer.  The analysis to compare the performance between PET/CT and CT in Period 
1 (week 28) showed there was no marked difference detected in the performance between PET/CT 
and CT reads (details in Section  3.3.1 ).  Specifically, the CT -only reading method reconfirmed the 
REGN2477 treatment effects on number or percentage of patients with new lesions, to tal number 
of new lesions, and volume of new lesions seen by PET/CT method primary read.  Based on this 
finding, the CT -only reading method will also be used to analyse all week 56 endpoints.   
The effect of REGN2477 on ‘flare -up’ will be evaluated in Peri od 2 with a new endpoint based on 
investigator -assessed flare -ups’ and the previously specified endpoint based on patient -assessed 
flare-up (by patient e -diary; Section  4.3.3 ) which will be analyzed in patients who switch from 
placebo in Period 1 to REGN2477 in Period 2 (Section  10.4.3.2.3 ). 
3.3.5.  Biochemi cal Markers of Bone Formation  
Biochemical markers of bone formation, bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and total 
alkaline phosphatase (tAP), are elevated in some patients with FOP at levels 2 - to 6-fold above 
those found in healthy subjects ( Al Kaissi 2016 , Kitoh 2013 ).  Elevations in these markers of bone 
formation are thought to be due to HO activity.  REGN2477 may depress the levels of these 
markers if they are elevated, compared with  the levels in patients who receive placebo.  Therefore, 
the effect of REGN2477 on these biomarkers as well as on other biochemical markers of bone 
formation and resorption will also be assessed.  
3.3.6.  Clinical Endpoint Measures  
We plan to measure clinical aspec ts of FOP disease activity (number and duration of flare -ups, 
location and severity of FOP disease signs and symptoms) via a daily diary completed by patients, 
physician assessment of joint involvement using the Cumulative Analog Joint Involvement Scale 
(CAJIS; Kaplan 2017 ), investigator -assessed flare -ups, patient reported quality of life assessments 
using the EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire with a 3 -level scale (EQ -5D-3L), additional 
questions relevant to Independent Acti vities of Daily Living for FOP patients from the Patient 
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) (collectively called the FOP I -
ADL Questionnaire), and spirometry assessment of pulmonary function. These measures will 
allow us to explore t he correlation between the longitudinal change in disease activities and the 
change in HO activities detected by imaging and biochemical measures of heterotopic bone 
formation. Patients with FOP describe pain associated with their disease, at times refract ory to 
analgesic treatments. Pain severity will be assessed daily in this study using a NRS, via the e -diary.  
3.3.7.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
The dose and dose regimen proposed for this study is 10 mg/kg IV Q4W.  In the FIH single -dose 
study, 10 mg/kg of REGN 2477 was generally well -tolerated and demonstrated saturation of target 
over the proposed dosing interval.  Therefore, it was chosen to initiate this proof of concept study 
in FOP.  The rationale for this dose and dose regimen is further discussed below.

CONFIDENTIAL  The clinical data from the FIH study of REGN2477 have demonstrated that single doses of 
10 mg/kg IV appear to be generally well -tolerated. In this study, single doses of REGN  2477 were 
administered IV and subcutaneous (SC) in healthy women not of child bea ring potential.  This 
study has been completed and database lock (DBL) occurred on 14 February 2017. A total of 
40 healthy subjects have received placebo or REGN2477 in a 1:3 ratio, with REGN2477 
administered at 0.3, 1, 3,  or 10 mg/kg IV and 300 mg SC doses.  Top line anal ysis of the final 
unblinded safety data indicates that all dose levels have been well -tolerated, and no safety signals 
have been identified. Top line PK and total activin A (a measure of target engagement) data from 
the FIH study demonstrate that 10 mg/kg dose will likely saturate the target over the Q4W dosing 
interval selected for this study, but that 3 mg/kg and lower doses may be subsaturating (see more 
detail in the IB).  
Preclinical efficacy data in FOP mice indicate that, in a prophylactic prevention  model, significant 
reduction in heterotopic bone formation was observed following 1 mg/kg given IV every week, 
and maximal effects were seen with 10 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg doses given SC every week.  At the 
1 mg/kg dose, the trough concentration of REGN2477 i n these mice was approximately 5  mg/L.  
Preliminary pharmacokinetics and activin A target engagement data from the FIH study suggest 
that a 10 mg/kg dose level, when administered Q4W, is likely to saturate the activin A target and 
to achieve, at 1 month, t rough drug levels above the pharmacologically active drug level observed 
in the FOP mouse model.  It is unknown, however, what concentrations of REGN2477 will be 
required to demonstrate a treatment effect in FOP patients with active HO.  Given the severity  of 
the disease and rarity of FOP patient, it is proposed that the 10 mg/kg dose given Q4W is likely to 
provide target coverage and is justified with appropriate close monitoring (see Section  3.4.1  and 
Section  3.4.2 ).  
Results from a chronic non -human primate preclinical toxicology study support this planned study 
in patients with FOP.  A 26 -week good laboratory practice (GLP) -compliant toxicology study was 
conducted in cynomolgus monkeys.  This study had a 12 -week recovery period.  There have been 
no adverse effects seen after 26 weeks of dosing  in this study at dosages up to and including 
50 mg/kg/week.  Therefore, the no -observed -adverse -event -level (NOAEL) in this study was 
50 mg/kg, the highest dose tested.  Based on systemic drug exposures in this toxicology study, the 
selected human dose of  10 mg/kg Q4W provides sufficient safety margin (exposure multiple) of 
approximately 5 -fold for the current study design.  
In 5-week GLP studies in rats, a 50 mg/kg NOAEL was established in female rats.  In male rats, 
however, REGN2477 related severe inflam mation was observed histologically in the epididymis 
and efferent ducts, resulting in a NOAEL of 0.2 mg/kg/week.  At dose levels above 0.2  mg/kg, 
decreases in sperm motility and counts were observed, which recovered after drug washout.

CONFIDENTIAL  Though the rat has been identified as the most sensitive species for the epididymal/testicular 
toxicity, 2 additional GLP 5 -week toxicity studies were conducted in 2 additional non - human 
primate species, green monkeys and marmoset monkeys, in order to better understand the potential 
effect of REGN2477 in humans.  Animals in these studies received REGN2477 once weekly for 
5 weeks.  Preliminary results of these ongoing studies have identified minimal inflammation and 
sperm stasis within a portion of the efferent ducts, with no  findings in the epididymis.  The severe 
effects on sperm quality (decreases in sperm motility and counts) observed in the rat studies were 
not observed in the short -term or long -term primate studies.  Marked differences in the magnitude 
of inflammation se en in rats versus nonhuman primates are considered to reflect species 
differences in the respective anatomy of the epididymis and efferent ducts ( Foley 2001 , La 2012 ).  
Nevertheless, epididymal toxic ity will be considered a potential risk for anti -activin A treatment 
pending further clinical experience.  
Patients in this proof of concept study will be closely monitored and safety data will be carefully 
reviewed by an IDMC (see Section  5.3.1 ) for any tolerability issues or safety signals.  In the event 
that significant tolerability issues or safety signals were to be identified, the dose level may be 
adjusted downward.  Dose modification and study drug treatment discontinuations rules are 
described in detail in Section  7.2). 
3.4. Study -Specific Safety Considerations and Monitoring  
A benefit versus risk assessment of REGN2477 is described in the IB.  
Study Conduct in Response to COVID -19 
Included in this amendment are  measures to account for the COVID -19 pandemic and to minimize 
the risks to the patients in the study as well as healthcare providers by allowing flexibility in the 
visit schedule while social distancing suggestions are in place.  Allowing for this flexibi lity does 
not increase the risk of participating in this study as there will be continued contact between the 
patients and study personnel despite postponement of in -person clinic visits.  
3.4.1.  Potential Risk for Reproductive Organ Adverse Events in Male Patient s and 
Monitoring  
As stated above, it is unclear whether the male reproductive organ findings from the rat will 
translate into clinically meaningful changes in the humans.  Because patients with FOP suffer from 
a severe, debilitating, and ultimately fatal a utosomal dominant genetic disease and because there 
is no approved treatment available, it is proposed that the potential benefit of REGN2477 in 
reducing HO activity may outweigh the potential risk of male reproductive changes.  
Male patients in this study will be informed of the potential risk of developing AEs of pain and/or 
discomfort, and swelling of the scrotum region, and decreased sperm counts, motility, and fertility.  
Sperm banking as a mitigating strategy for the potential risk of reduced fertility  following 
treatment should be discussed with male patients.  If requested, sperm banking procedures may be 
conducted as directed by the patient’s own physician before the start of study drug treatment and 
will not be a study procedure.  Baseline urogenita l exams, including scrotum ultrasound with 
Doppler, will be conducted prior to initiation of treatment and patients will be followed for relevant 
AEs.  Specifically, complaints of epididymitis, orchitis, hydrocele, scrotum pain, or scrotum 
swelling will be  followed as adverse events of special interest (AESIs, see Section  9.4.3 ).  Patients

CONFIDENTIAL  who experience any of these AEs will be evaluated by a study ur ologist, and will be referred for 
clinical care by an appropriate specialist.  Scrotum ultrasound may be performed, if clinically 
warranted, during follow -up of the AE.  Biomarkers of testicular injury (serum concentrations of 
testosterone, follicle stimul ating hormone [FSH], and luteinizing hormone [ LH]) will be monitored 
throughout the study.   
3.4.2.  Potential Risk for Teratogenicity/Fetal Toxicity and Pregnancy Monitoring and 
Prevention  
Results in an ongoing enhanced pre/postnatal development study of REGN2477  in cynomolgus 
monkeys showed a potential risk for teratogenicity/fetal toxicity.  REGN2477 has had no 
abortifacient effects thus far, nor has it resulted in any maternal toxicity.  However, treatment with 
REGN2477 resulted in some early births, infant mal formations, a stillbirth, and infant mortality 
(for detailed description of the study, see IB).  In the 50 mg/kg group, none of the pregnancies 
resulted in a normal birth; all had severe total body alopecia, and died shortly after birth or were 
stillborn.  The cause of death has not yet been established.  Exposure to 5  mg/kg did not result in 
severe alopecia or mortality; however, some of these animals had adverse findings of teeth 
abnormalities and neurological deficiencies during their functional observat ion battery.  Data 
collection from this study’s remaining in -life phase is still incomplete.  
Strict measures will be taken to avoid giving REGN2477 to pregnant women.  Women of child 
bearing potential (WoCBP) will only be enrolled in this study after the r esults of a pregnancy test 
are negative.  Pregnancy testing will be performed and a negative pregnancy result will be 
confirmed prior to each subsequent dose administration.  Monthly menstrual history will be 
collected, and pregnancy testing and reminders for contraception use will be conducted during the 
study and during the follow -up period.  In addition, WoCBP and male patients with WoCBP 
partners will be instructed to use highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study.  
While the level o f antibody drugs in the semen are normally found at extremely low levels, the 
levels of REGN2477 that may cross into the semen is unknown, given the potential for 
inflammation of the efferent duct associated with REGN2477 treatment.  Therefore, a more 
conservative approach to contraception requirements will be applied to male patients enrolled in 
this study.  Male patients with WoCBP partners will be asked to use condom to prevent fetal 
exposure and to inform and ensure their female partners to use highly e ffective contraception 
measures to prevent pregnancy. In case pregnancy occurs, the investigator will follow the 
pregnancy until delivery (Section  9.4.3 ). If the pregnancy continues to term (delivery), the health 
of the infant will be followed -up for a period of 3 -months postnatally.  
3.4.3.  Risk for Epistaxis and Monitoring  
Due to AEs of epistaxis reported during the conduct of the R2477 -FOP-1623 study throu gh 
30 Jan 2019, epistaxis was considered a potential risk with REGN2477.  Results from 
R2477 -FOP-1623 safety analysis during the 28 -week double blind treatment period (Period 1) and 
up to data cut -off date of 17 Sep 2019 showed imbalances in TEAEs, with hi gher incidence of 
epistaxis in the REGN2477 group (50.0%) compared to placebo (16.7%).  When patients in the 
placebo group transitioned to REGN2477 in the ongoing open -label period (Period 2), epistaxis 
was reported in a total of 9 (20.9%) patients, includin g 5 (20.8%) patients who received placebo 
during the double -blind treatment period and 4 (21.1%) patients who received REGN2477 during 
the double -blind treatment period.  Although epistaxis has been a frequently reported TEAE, the

CONFIDENTIAL  reported events have been predominantly mild in severity with no effect on patients’ ability to 
receive REGN2477 .  Only 1 patient experienced a serious event of epistaxis.  The study is ongoing, 
and patients are in the open -label period (Period 2) or the follow -up treatment period (Period 3) . 
In toxicology studies with monkey and rats, REGN2477 50 mg/kg/week treatment (26 -weeks for 
monkeys, 5 -weeks for rats) did not result in epistaxis findings, other bleeding events, or 
abnormalities in coagulation test results in either species.  
In the completed R2477 -HV-1525 study which evaluated a single -dose administration of 
REGN2477 10 mg/kg IV, there were no episodes of epistaxis or other bleeding episodes.  In the 
completed R2477 -1033 -HV-1621, 6 subjects received REGN2477 alone (10 mg/kg IV ) and 
24 subjects received REGN2477 (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 10 mg/kg) in combination with REGN1033 
(6 mg/kg REGN1033).  One 1 episode of mild epistaxis occurred in 1 subject who received the 
10 mg/kg REGN2477 + 6 mg/kg REGN1033 combination (high dose).  This  epistaxis AE occurred 
3 days after administration of study drug, was considered mild, and was assessed by the 
investigator as related to the study drug.  
In order to mitigate the potential risk for patients, 3 exclusion criteria were added to this protocol : 
1) concomitant antiplatelet therapy (other than low dose acetylsalicylic acid) or anticoagulants, 
2) any history of severe, non -traumatic bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization for 
hemodynamic compromise, 3) known preexisting medical history o f a bleeding diathesis 
(Section  6.2.2 ).  In addition, investigators should discourage the use of anti -inflammatory drugs, 
to the extent possible.   
In ord er to monitor the occurrence of epistaxis or other important bleeding episodes, moderate 
epistaxis (defined as any episode lasting longer than 30 minutes or requiring professional medical 
intervention), severe epistaxis (based on definition of a severe AE as described in Section  9.5.1 ), 
and other AEs of moderate to severe non -traumatic bleeding will be followed as adverse events of 
special interest (AE SIs, see Section  9.4.3 ). 
Baseline and post -treatment assessment of coagulation parameters (activated partial 
thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, international normalization ratio [INR], thrombin time), 
fibrinogen, and platelet effector function will be performed.  For all patients who are currently 
enrolled in the study, the assessment of coagulation parameters (including, but not limited to 
activa ted partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, INR) and platelet effector function will 
be performed at their next evaluation, unless these tests have been performed in the past year.  If 
possible, for patients with a moderate or severe AESI of epistax is or other non -traumatic bleeding, 
the investigator should attempt to obtain an unscheduled assessments of coagulation parameters 
and platelet effector function as close as possible to the time of this AESI.  
3.4.4.  Risk for Skin and Soft Tissue Infection and Mon itoring  
During the double -blind treatment period (Period 1) of the ongoing R2477 -FOP-1623 study, skin 
infection TEAEs (including folliculitis, abscesses, cellulitis, and pustular rash) were reported in 
patients treated with REGN2477 and none of the patient s treated with placebo.  None of these 
events were serious, severe, or led to discontinuation of study treatment.  
During the open -label treatment period (Period 2/3) of R2477 -FOP-1623 study, skin and soft tissue 
infection TEAEs (including folliculitis, fur uncles, abscess, carbuncle, and cellulitis) were reported 
in patients treated with REGN2477, including patients treated with placebo and patients treated

CONFIDENTIAL  with REGN2477during Period 1.  Two patients experienced serious abscesses which required 
admission to the hospital for incision and drainage.  The events resolved, and the patients continued 
to receive REGN2477 after a temporary treatment interruption.  
In the completed R2477 -HV-1525 study, no TEAEs involving skin and soft tissue infections were 
reported.  In the completed R2477 -1033 -HV-1621 study, acne was reported in 1 (12.5%) patient 
and skin infection in 1 patient (12.5%).  
Special attention should be directed towards early detection of skin and soft tissue infections.  
Good hygiene and early and proactiv e monitoring for potential lesions is recommended.  Particular 
attention should be paid to areas with poor ventilation, such as the perigenital and underarm areas.  
3.4.5.  Potential Iatrogenic Injuries  
Soft tissue injuries, especially those involving muscle, may induce flare -ups and HO in patients 
with FOP.  There have been anecdotal reports of flare -ups induced by phlebotomy procedures and 
blood pressure cuff pressure.  Study personnel will be trained to minimize the risk of iatrogenic 
soft tissue injuries.  
3.4.6.  Radia tion Exposure  
Positron emission tomography/CT is an imaging procedure that involves ionizing radiation 
exposure to the patient.  The ionizing radiation deposited in tissue is expressed in units of mSv.  
The effective dose (ED) is a single figure that refer s to the tissue -weighted radiation dose to the 
subject, accounting for stochastic risk effects associated with the radiation exposure.  In the US, 
the maximum recommended allowed ED for an adult research subject in a single year is 50  mSv 
(CFR 21, vol. 5, 2015).  In the European Union, the guidelines for studies intended to gain 
knowledge directly aimed at the prevention or cure of disease establish an ED limit of up to 20  mSv 
per year for adult subjects.  In the present study, for an adult patient each dos e of 18F-NaF will 
result in an annual ED of approximately 2.4 mSv to 8.9  mSv, while a CT scan will result in an ED 
of approximately 2.9 mSv to 5.1  mSv, for a cumulative ED range of 16 mSv to 42  mSv.  For all 5 
scans planned for the study, the total ED rang e is approximately 25 mSv to 56  mSv.  In selected 
cases, a single low -dose CT scan may change the total ED range to 29 mSv to 60 mSv.  The total 
radiation exposure during the entire study could be up to the equivalent of 3  diagnostic CT  scans 
of the chest,  abdomen, and pelvis.  Radiation risk information will be included in the informed 
consent form.

Anti-drug antibody variables include status (positive or negative) and titer as follows:  
• Total number of patients whose response in the ADA assay is negative at all time points 
analyzed  
• Pre-existing immunoreactivity: defined either as a positive ADA assay res ponse at 
baseline with all post -dose ADA assay results negative, or a positive assay response at 
baseline with all post -dose ADA assay responses less than 9 -fold over baseline titer 
levels  
• Treatment -emergent: defined as any positive ADA assay response when  baseline 
results are negative or missing.  Treatment -emergent responses are further classified 
as:

least 2 consecutive post baseline samples separated by at least a 12 -week post 
baseline period (based on actual sampling time), with no ADA -negative samples 
in-between, regardless of any missing samples or a positive response at the last 
ADA sampling time point,  
− Indeterminate: a positive response at the last collection time point only, regard less 
of any missing samples, or  
− Transient: not persistent or indeterminate, regardless of any missing samples, 
ie, may be positive over less than a 12 -week post baseline period, and not positive 
on the last ADA sampling time point.  
• Treatment -boosted: defi ned as any post -dose positive ADA assay response that has titer 
≥9-fold over the baseline titer when baseline results are positive  
• Titer values  
− Low (titer <1,000)  
− Moderate (1,000≤ titer ≤10,000)  
− High (titer >10,000)  
5. STUDY DESIGN  
5.1. Study Description and Durat ion  
This is a phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled, study designed to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, PK, and effects on heterotopic bone formation of repeated doses of 10 mg/kg IV 
REGN2477 Q4W in adult patients with FOP.  Patients may be enrolled a t multiple sites globally.  
Up to 40 FOP patients may be enrolled to yield approximately 24 or more  patients with the classic 
ACVR1[R206H] mutation and with active HO at baseline as determined by 18F-NaF PET/CT.

CONFIDENTIAL  As depicted in the study design schematics ( Figure  1), this study consists of a screening/baseline 
period (day -28 to day -1), two 6 -month treatment periods, and a follow -up treatment period 
(Perio d 3).  The 3  treatment periods are:  
• Period 1: a 6 -month randomized double -blind placebo -controlled treatment period  
• Period 2: a 6 -month open -label REGN2477 treatment period  
• Period 3: a follow -up treatment period with REGN2477 continuing until patients have  
completed the week 76 visit, and all data have been collected and validated through the 
time when the last patient randomized into the study completes the week  28 visit 
(Period 1)  
After Period 3 (week 76), patients can continue to receive REGN2477 treatme nt Q4W based on 
details described in Section  5.1.4 .  A limited number of assessments for safety, efficacy, and 
clinical pharmacology parameters will  be conducted.   
In light of the public health emergency related to COVID -19, study procedures, including study 
drug administration, may be conducted by trained staff at or near patients’ residences (ie, at home 
visits) or at alternative sites established to minimize study patient to exposure to the SARS -CoV -2.

Study Visit 1  
 
Note:  The patients who completed through study week 76 may c ontinue REGN2477 treatment beyond week 80 
(described in Section  5.1.4 ). 
5.1.1.  Screening/Baseline Period (Day -28 to Day -1): Study Visit 1  
During the scree ning/baseline period, all patients will undergo the informed consent process and 
screening/baseline procedures.  Procedures during this visit may be conducted on different days 
(Table  1). 
The following screening procedures will be conducted: review of medical/surgical history and 
prior/concomitant medications, physical exams, confirmation of clinical diagnosis of FOP and 
documentation of ACVR1 genotype, including the classic [R206H] or diff erent ACVR1 mutations, 
laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG, and the study physician’s assessment of a patient’s 
ability to undergo imaging and other procedures described in the study protocol.  If at the time of

CONFIDENTIAL  screening, the patient doesn’t have doc umentation of what ACVR1 mutation he/she carries or it 
cannot be retrieved, then the study site staff should collect a blood sample for determination of the 
ACVR1 mutation prior to randomization.  Laboratory assessments and other procedures used to 
determi ne eligibility may be repeated once during the screening period.  Patients and their primary 
caregiver(s), if assistance is needed, will be given instructions on how to complete the FOP disease 
activity diary and the pain NRS.  For male patients, baseline urogenital exams will be conducted 
by the study urologist and scrotum ultrasound will be performed to aid detection of existing 
abnormality and to capture pretreatment baseline image.  For all patients, an assessment of 
coagulation parameters (including, b ut not limited to activated partial thromboplastin time, 
prothrombin time, INR, thrombin time), fibrinogen, and platelet effector function will be 
performed at baseline visit for newly enrolled patients and prior to next administration of study 
drug for en rolled patients. In addition, assessment of coagulation parameters and platelet effector 
function will be performed at several visits during Period 1 and Period 2 to explore mechanism of 
epistaxis  and REGN2477 mechanism of action ( Table  1 and Table  2).  If possible, for patients 
with a moderate or seve re AESI of epistaxis or other non -traumatic bleeding, the investigator 
should attempt to obtain an unscheduled assessment of coagulation parameters and platelet effector 
function as close as possible to the time of this AESI.  
Patients who meet initial elig ibility screening will have baseline procedures conducted.  Baseline 
imaging procedures (whole body 18F-PET, low dose CT) will be performed within 1 week of study 
drug administration (study day 1), ie, within study day -7 to day -1, to identify and charact erize 
index HO lesions.  Patients must be physically able and willing to undergo both PET and CT 
measures to be eligible for this study.  Pre -dose baseline PK, anti -drug antibody, activin  A, and 
other biomarker samples will be collected.  Pretreatment CAJI S, daily pain NRS, patient reported 
FOP disease activity diary, and other patient reported outcome questionnaires will be completed.  
The baseline entry for both the daily pain NRS and the daily FOP disease diary will be on day -1.  
A blood sample will be collected from all patients for future ACVR1 gene sequencing.   
Women of child bearing potential and male patients with WoCBP partners will be reminded at all 
visits to adhere to highly effective contraception (defined in exclusion criteria 16 and 17).  
Pregnancy status and menstrual cycle history  of WoCBP will be monitored through the end  of the 
study.   
5.1.2.  Period 1:  Double -Blind Treatment (Week 1 [Day 1] to Week 24 [Day  169]) and 
End of Period 1 Assessments (Week 28 [Day 197])  
Patients will be randomized to receive REGN2477 at 10  mg/kg dose or match ing placebo, 
administered IV Q4W through week  24, for a total of 7 doses, as outlined in the schedule of events 
(Table  1).  Randomization will be strati fied by gender, classic ACVR1[R206H] mutation/different 
ACVR1 mutations, and by presence/absence of baseline active HO lesions as determined by 
18F-NaF PET/CT.  Baseline imaging data will be reviewed by a central imaging analysis vendor 
and Regeneron Clinical Imaging Director prior to randomization.  
Patients will be closely monitored for a minimum of 120 minutes after administration of study 
drug.  
To ensure safety of this approach, individual patients will be closely monitored and safety of each 
dose w ill be reviewed by the investigator and the Regeneron medical monitor prior to 
administering the subsequent repeated dose.  The safety review to be conducted by the investigator

CONFIDENTIAL  and Regeneron medical monitor prior to study drug infusions on visits 2, 5, 6 and 7 (Period 1) and 
visits 11, 12, 13 and 14 (Period 2) will include evaluation of laboratory test (hematology, blood 
chemistry and urinalysis) results collected as part of these visits (see Section  8.1).  For the 
remaining study visits, assessment of results of hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis tests 
planned for these same visits may be performed, but will not be required prior to study drug  
infusion.  The decision not to wait for the results of these exams, processed at the study’s central 
laboratory, should be made on a case -by-case basis, if the patient’s clinical condition, TEAE 
profile, and assessment of vital signs, ECGs and previous la boratory test results indicate that the 
patient is suitable to receive the next dose of study drug.  For the study visits after week 56 
(Period  3), the need for a safety review by the investigator and Regeneron medical monitor will be 
decided on a case -by-case basis.  In addition, the IDMC (see Section  5.3.1 ) will regularly monitor 
the unblinded study -level safety data.  
In the event that a significant tolerability issue or safety concern is identified, dose modification 
or study drug discontinuation may be implemented according to Section  7.2. 
Efficacy and safety procedures will be performed as outlined in the schedule of events ( Table  1).  
Adverse events will be assessed as described in Section  9.4.  Index HO lesion identified at baseline 
and new HO lesions will be assessed by imaging endpoint measures including whole body 18F-NaF 
PET and wh ole body low dose CT at week  8 (day 57 [±7  days]), and week 28 (day 197 [±7  days]).  
Clinical endpoints will be assessed by investigator or patient reported outcome measures at week 
28 (day 197 [±7  days]).  The daily pain NRS and FOP disease activity diary  will be checked at 
every visit for completeness.  
Serum samples for the determination of REGN2477 concentration and ADA will be collected.  
Serum samples for the determination of bone formation and mechanism of action biomarkers, 
BSAP, tAP, and P1NP, inflam mation biomarker, hs -CRP, as well as markers related to the Activin 
A and Activin receptor pathway including but not limited to Activin and BMP ligands or markers 
that may elucidate the mechanism of action of REGN2477 will be collected.  
Additional biomarke r samples will be collected as described in the schedule of events ( Table  1).

[Day 365]) and End of Period 2 Assessments (Week 56 [Day 393])  
All patients who complete the double -blind treatment p eriod will receive REGN2477 administered 
IV at a dose of 10  mg/kg Q4W through week  52, for a total of 7 doses as outlined in the schedule 
of events ( Table  2). 
Efficacy and safety procedures will be performed as outlined in the schedule of events ( Table  2).  
For patients previously treated with placebo drug , week 28 (day 197) assessments will be 
considered as pretreatment baseline for safety and efficacy analysis of this period of the study.  
Index HO lesion identified at baseline and new HO lesions will be assessed by imaging endpoint 
measures including whol e body 18F-NaF PET and whole body low dose CT at week  56

5.1.5.  Study Stopping Rules  
5.1.5.1.  Study Stopping Criteria  
The emerging benefit -risk profile of REGN2477 treatment will be closely monitored by an IDMC.  
The IDMC (defined in Section  5.3.1 ) will monitor unblinded data on an ongoing basis to assess 
the risk/benefit profile of REGN2477.  The IDMC will meet to review the unblinded safety data 
after 6 patients have completed 4 weeks of study drug treatment and safety data has become 
available, and monthly thereafter.  As the study progresses, based upon the enrollment rate, the 
cumulative review of safety data, and at the discretion of the IDMC members, the IDMC may 
choose to meet on a quarterly basis.  
If at any time the IDMC has signi ficant concerns regarding a meaningful imbalance in SAEs and 
AESIs, the IDMC may make a recommendation to the sponsor to temporarily halt the study 
(screening, randomization, or dosing of study drug) for additional review.  Based on the outcome 
of the revi ew and discussions with investigators and if appropriate, regulatory authorities, the study 
may be suspended, restarted, or terminated.  In the event of a study restart after a temporary halt, 
dose modification, if needed, will be determined as described i n Section  7.2.1 . 
The IDMC will not conduct any formal efficacy analyses, other than in their oversight of safety 
and evaluation of risk benefit profi le.  There are no formal early stopping criteria for efficacy.  
5.1.5.2.  Individual Patient Stopping Rule  
Dosing in an individual patient may be temporarily or permanently stopped according to 
Section  7.2.2 . 
5.1.6.  End of Study Definition  
The end of study for this study is defined as the last visit of the last patient.  
5.2. Planned Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned.  
5.3. Study Committees  
5.3.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC, composed of members who are independent from the sponsor and the study 
investigators, will monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of cumulative unblinded 
safety data.  If requested, the IDMC may h ave access to any other data for the purposes of a 
risk-benefit assessment.

REGN2477.  
During the follow -up treatment period (Period 3), each patient will continue to receive open label 
REGN2477.  
7.2. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
7.2.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification will be allowed if emerging safety signals indicates the need for a reduct ion of 
dose level according to the criteria set out below.  Dose modification will imply a reduction from 
10 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg IV Q4W in patients with FOP.  
To ensure safety of this approach, individual patients will be closely monitored and safety of each 
dose will be reviewed by the investigator and Regeneron medical monitor prior to administering 
the subsequent repeated dose. The blinded safety review to be conducted by the investigator and 
Regeneron medical monitor prior to study drug infusions on visits  2, 5, 6 and 7 (Period 1) and 
visits 11, 12, 13 and 14 (Period 2) will include evaluation of laboratory test (hematology, blood 
chemistry and urinalysis) results collected as part of these visits (see Section  8.1). For the 
remaining study visits, assessment of results of hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis tests 
planned for these same visits may be performed, b performed, but will not be requir ed prior to 
study drug infusion.  The decision not to wait for the results of these exams, processed at the 
study’s central laboratory, should be made on a case -by-case basis, if the patient’s clinical 
condition, TEAE profile, and assessment of vital signs , ECGs and previous laboratory test results 
indicate that the patient is suitable to receive the next dose of study drug.  For the study visits after 
week 56 (Period 3), the need for a safety review by the investigator and Regeneron medical 
monitor prior t o infusion of REGN2477 will be decided on a case -by-case basis.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Page 72 of 126 
CONFIDENTIAL  7.2.1.1.  Individual Level Dose Modification  
Individual patient dose modification will be determined on a case -by-case basis based on the 
discussion between the investigator and Regeneron medical monit or, Regeneron Global Patient 
Safety , and approved by the Vice President Early Clinical Development or his/her designee.   
If 1 of the following occurs, individual dose modification will be considered;  
• Occurrence of 1 severe AE deemed to be related to the study drug.  
• Moderate to severe scrotum pain or swelling not otherwise justified by an alternate 
etiology after urology follow up assessment.  
The following AEs will not be considered as meeting the dosing modification rule:  
• Any AE that has a clear alternati ve causation  
• Episodes of flare -up or worsening of signs and symptoms of FOP  
After individual level dose reduction and depending upon the patient’s clinical evolution following 
1 or more infusions of 3 mg/kg IV of Q4W study drug, the investigator may consid er resuming the 
original 10 mg/kg IV Q4W dosing regimen.  The investigator will communicate with Regeneron 
medical monitor before resuming the original dose.  Prior to resuming the original dose, the 
Regeneron medical monitor will discuss with Regeneron Gl obal Patient Safety and obtain approval 
by the Vice President Early Clinical Development or his/her designee.  
Any individual level dose modification that occurs will be communicated by Regeneron medical 
monitor to the IDMC in a timely manner.  
7.2.1.2.  Study Level Dose Modification  
The IDMC (see Section  5.3.1 ) will regularly monitor the unblinded safety data and, based on 
significant concerns regarding a meanin gful imbalance in the frequency and/or severity of AEs or 
altered laboratory results, may make recommendations to the sponsor to consider dose 
modification.  
Study level dose modification will be determined by the sponsor upon recommendation of the 
IDMC fol lowing their review of safety, PK, and total activin A (target engagement) data available 
at the time.  
7.2.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study  
will be asked to return to the cli nic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule and for 
blood sample collection for measurement of serum drug and target, and ADA:  at 4 weeks, 8  weeks, 
16 weeks, and 28 weeks after the last dose of study drug.  Safety lab exams (ie, hematology, blood 
chemistry and urinalysis) may also be collected during these visits at the investigator's discretion.  
A blood sample collection for assessment of ADA will occur at the patient’s last visit.  
Patients  who permanently discontinue from study drug and wh o opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section  8.1.2 .

7.3. Management of Acute Reactions  
7.3.1.  Acute Infusion Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of infusion reactions mus t be available for 
immediate use.  All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined  in Section  9.4.1 ) and 
graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section  9.5.1 . 
7.3.1.1.  Interruption of the Infusion  
The infusion should be interrupted if any of the following AEs occur:  
• cough  
• rigors/chil ls 
• rash, pruritus (itching)  
• urticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
• diaphoresis (sweating)  
• hypotension  
• dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
• vomiting  
• flushing  
The reaction(s) should be treated symptomatically, and the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the 
original rate  provided that the symptoms are adequately managed.  
If investigators feel there is a medical need for treatment or discontinuation of the infusion other 
than described above, they should use clinical judgment to provide the appropriate response 
according t o typical clinical practice.

• other neurologi cal symptoms (confusion, loss of consciousness, paresthesia, 
paralysis  etc) 
• any other symptom or sign that, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants 
discontinuation of the infusion  
7.4. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Patients will be randomly assigned to re ceive REGN2477 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio (REGN2477: 
placebo) on study day 1.  Patients will be randomized according to a central randomization scheme, 
using an interactive response technology (IRT) provided to the designated study pharmacist or 
qualified d esignee.  
7.4.1.  Blinding  
Study patients, investigators, Regeneron Study Director, medical monitor, study monitor, and any 
other Regeneron or contract research organization (CRO) personnel who are in regular contact 
with the study site will be blinded to treatmen t assignment during the double -blind treatment 
period of the study.  
The PET and CT imaging and bone biomarker data collected after randomization will not be 
communicated to the sites or the sponsor’s study team members who may have regular interactions 
with the sites, until the study data is locked for primary analysis or subsequent analysis in the 
study.  
Drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used.  In order to maintain the blind, 
lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to individuals involved in 
study conduct .  An unblinded pharmacist or qualified designee at the site will prepare the drug 
product prior to transferring it to study personnel involved in other study conduct.  The person 
preparing the drug  will not participate in other aspects of study conduct.  
7.4.2.  Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding  of treatment assignment for a patient  may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy).  
• If unblinding  is required:  
− Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind  the treatment assignment.  
                                        VV-RIM-00123469-1.0 Approved - 28 Aug 2020 GMT-5:00

investigator for the site will unblind the patient.  
− The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee before unblinding  the 
patient, whenever possible.  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other t han the unblinded study 
pharmacist/designee (when applicable),  at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the 
case of a true emergency.  In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site 
fulfilling that role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
7.5. Treatment Logist ics and Accountability  
7.5.1.  Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
A medication numbering system will be used to label the investigational study drug.  Lists linking 
medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups (or companies) 
responsib le for study drug packaging.  In order to maintain the blind, these lists will not be 
accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.

1. Procedures other than those associated with drug administration and imaging procedures 
may be conducted by trained study staff at or near patients’ residences (ie, at home visits).  
2. Study visit 3 (day 2) will be conducted in the clinic following the first dose of study drug, 
although no study drug administration or imaging procedure is conducted at this visit.  
3. Procedures may be conducted on different days during the screening/baseline period, if 
needed.  Blood draws for laboratory testing at the screening visit will be collected in a 
fasted state (after an 8 -hour fast).  No other blood draw will require fasting.  
4. Medical histor y should include detailed FOP history, and prior medication and surgery for 
treatment of FOP.  
5. Documentation of ACVR1 genotype, including classic [R206H] or different ACVR1 
mutations should be obtained for study file.  If at the time of screening, the patie nt doesn’t 
have documentation of what ACVR1 mutation he/she carries or it cannot be retrieved, then 
the study site staff should collect a blood sample for the testing by the investigator to 
determine the ACVR1 mutation prior to randomization .  This testing , which will be 
performed on an as needed basis, is separate from the mandatory whole blood collection 
described in footnote #21.   
6. All patients who receive study drug will be closely monitored after each study drug 
administration for at least 2 hours.  
7. Study procedures within each visit may be conducted on different days, within the stated 
visit window.  If conducted on the same day, vital signs and ECG will be conducted before 
blood sampling, and blood samples (except 18F-NaF tracer concentrations) will be  collected 
before imaging procedures. Study drug administration will be performed last at that study 
visit.   
8. On study day 1 (Period 1) and on study day 197 (Period 2), vital signs will be collected 
pre-dose and post -dose at 1 hour and 4  hours after the en d of infusion.  On subsequent 
visits, vital signs will be collected prior to dosing.  
9. On study day 1 (Period 1) and on study day 197 (Period 2), ECG will be conducted pre -
dose and post -dose 1 hour and 4 hours after the end of infusion.  On subsequent visits , ECG 
will be conducted prior to dosing.  ECG and symptom -directed physical examination may 
be performed during Period 3 at the investigator’s discretion.  
10. Menstrual history and pregnancy status of WoCBP will be determined at the screening 
visit.  Menstrual  events and pregnancy status of WoCBP will be monitored at each visit, 
except visit 3 and visit 4.  For all patients, contraception use will be confirmed.  A negative 
result for the pregnancy test must be obtained prior to each study drug administration. A fter 
week 56, urine pregnancy testing will be performed prior to each REGN2477 dose 
administration.  A serum pregnancy test will be performed at the patient’s end of study 
visit.  
11. In some patients, it may not be possible to obtain venous blood samples for a ll tests. Serum 
pregnancy tests and other blood tests for determining eligibility must be obtained.  Blood 
samples for safety labs will be prioritized.

CONFIDENTIAL  12. The baseline imaging assessments by 18F-NaF PET and low dose CT must be conducted 
between day -7 to day -1. 
13. The 18F-NaF PET may be performed at a separate location than the study clinic, within the 
visit window, before study drug administration.  Blood samples for the determination of 
the tracer concentration in plasma will be collected for baseline and week 56 imaging 
sessions from a subset of patients who will undergo an optional dynamic PET scan.  Any 
incidental findings identified through PET/CT scans will be reported to the investigator 
and medical monitor.  The investigator will communicate any findings to the patient.  
14. Daily pain NRS score and FOP disease activity will be collected as entries in a diary 
completed by.  If the patient is physically unable to or requires assistance to complete the 
e-diary on their own caregivers can complete or provide assis tance in completion of the e -
diary.  Caregivers can only physically assist with completion of the e -diary and there is to 
be no interpretation of patient disease activity on their part.  
15. Separate consent is required for participation in the optional genomic  DNA sub -study and 
collection of blood sample (DNA).  The blood sample for genomic DNA should be 
collected on day 1 or may be collected at any visit.  
16. Patients will undergo end of double -blind treatment (Period 1) assessments at the week 28 
visit (Period 1), which is the first visit in the open -label treatment (Period  2) with 
administration of open -label REGN2477.  
17. The week 80 column illustrates additional visits and procedures to be performed Q4W 
(study drug administration, concomitant medications, and saf ety assessments) and every 
24 weeks (laboratory testing, clinical endpoint measures, PK/drug concentration and ADA 
samples).  The first collection of the assessments conducted every 24 weeks would be at 
week 100  (visit 29) .  The serum pregnancy test should  only be required when the patient is 
performing the last visit in the study and thereafter will not receive additional infusions of 
REGN2477.  The criteria for continued administration of REGN2477 after week 76 is 
described in Section  5.1.4 . 
18. The baseline entry for both the daily pain NRS and the daily FOP disease activity diary 
will be on day -1. 
19. Patients will undergo end of open -label treatment (Period 2) assessments at the week 56 
visit, which is the first visit of the follow -up treatment period (Period 3).  
20. Patients can be rescreened for study participation.  
21. All patients will have a whole blood sample collected, preferably at the screening/basel ine 
visit, for future ACVR1 gene sequencing.   However, the sample can be collected at any 
time during the study period, as the result of this test is not to be used for assessment of 
study eligibility.  
22. Depending upon the level of musculoskeletal compromise  for a patient, the measurement 
of the patient’s height may not be precise or sometimes not possible to be assessed.  
23. A urinalysis and culture will be collected/performed if there is an AESI (only applicable to 
male patients).

questionnaire is not available in a patient’s native language at the time of enrollment that 
questionnaire will not be part of the required study procedures for that patient.  
25. For patients already enr olled in the study, the blood sample for these assessments will be 
collected at their next visit, unless these assessments have been performed in the past year.  
These assessments will be conducted locally.   
26. Study drug to be administered IV by trained nur sing staff either at study site or in local 
community healthcare setting close to patient or at a home visit.  
27. A low -dose CT only scan may be performed if 18F-NaF tracer or PET/CT scanner is 
unavailable during a scheduled visit (Section  5.1.3 , Section  5.1.4 ).  This low -dose CT scan 
may be perform ed by trained staff either at study site, at other clinical sites with access to 
a CT scanner, or using a mobile qualified CT scanner at a local community healthcare 
setting close to patient or at a home visit.  
28. After the week 56 visit, samples for hematol ogy, blood chemistry and urinalysis will be 
collected every 24 weeks. After the week 80 visit (visit 2 4) samples will continue to be 
collected as outlined in footnote 17 with the next sample collection at week 100 (visit 29). 
Although blood for safety will  be collected approximately every 6 months, at the discretion 
of the study physician, additional blood and urine samples may be collected if a safety 
concern arises.  
8.1.2.  Early Termination Visit  
Patients who are permanently withdrawn from the study drug will be  asked to return to the clinic 
for an early termination visit consisting of week 56 study assessments.  Patients who permanently 
discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study will be asked to return to 
the clinic for all remaining stud y visits per the visit schedule and for blood sample collection for 
measurement of serum drug and target, and ADA: at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 28 weeks 
after the last dose of study drug.  Safety lab exams (ie, hematology, blood chemistry and urinaly sis) 
may also be collected during these visits at the investigator's discretion (Section  7.2.2 ).  A blood 
sample collection for assessment of ADA will occur at the patient’s last visit.  
8.1.3.  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep patients on the study schedule.  Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, or for any 
other reason, as warranted.  
8.2. Study Procedures  
8.2.1.  Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility 
or characterizing the baseline population:  medical, prior  medication, and surgical history, 
urogenital exam and scrotum ultrasound with Doppler (for male patients only), confirmation of 
FOP diagnosis including documentation of ACVR1 mutation, blood collection for ACVR1 gene

undergo imaging and other procedures described in the study protocol.  
8.2.2.  Imaging Procedures  
8.2.2.1.  Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Procedures  
Positron emission tomography with 18F-NaF and volumet ric CT will be used to measure the change 
in heterotopic bone formation.  The PET/CT scans will be performed at the time points specified 
in Section  8.1.  PET/CT scans will be used to assess changes to the uptake of 18F-NaF in suspected 
active HO lesions as well as uptake into new lesions over time.  A PET/CT scanner will be used 
to acquire dynamic and/or static emission and CT images from patients wi th FOP.  All patients 
will undergo whole body static emission 18F-NaF PET scan.  An optional dynamic emission 18F-
NaF PET scans may be performed in a subset of patients, based on sites’ capabilities and patients’ 
consent, over a predefined region of the body using a single -bed position.  Static emission PET 
scans will be performed in the same session after the dynamic scan is completed.  Static emission 
PET scans axial field of view will be specified in the imaging manual.  Low -dose CT acquisitions 
will be performed contemporaneously and will cover similar regions as those of the static emission 
PET scan.  Blood samples will be collected for assessment of 18F-NaF concentration in plasma 
from the subset of patients who will consent and undergo dynamic emissio n 18F-NaF PET scans.  
Patients will not need to fast, and may take all their usual medications as permitted by the study 
(see Section  7.6).  Patients  should be well hydrated to promote rapid excretion of the tracer to 
decrease radiation dose and to improve image quality.  Patients should be positioned comfortably 
on the bed of the scanner with supportive aids (eg, pillows and blankets) as necessary to minimize 
involuntary movement during the scan.  
Detailed descriptions of the PET/CT procedures and the criteria for identifying active HO lesions 
will be provided in the study imaging manual.  Personnel at all sites will undergo training for 
PET/CT acquisit ion procedures as described in the study imaging manual.  The sponsor or its 
representative(s) will conduct site visits to monitor and ensure that the study is executed according 
to the study protocol.  The PET/CT scans will be read and analyzed using a blinded central reading 
center.  The investigator will be allowed to independently read and analyze baseline PET/CT 
images while blinded to subsequent study treatment.  In order to avoid potential unblinding, the 
investigator will not be allowed to read or  analyze PET/CT images acquired from a patient 
randomized into the study after study drug dosing has been initiated.  
In the event that a pathological finding that potentially requires medical attention (eg, suspected 
malignancy) is identified, the sponsor and the investigator will be informed of the finding. The 
imaging data may be provided to the investigator upon discussion with the sponsor.  The 
investigator will communicate any findings to the patient.  
In light of the public health emergency related to the COVID -19 pandemic, Investigators may 
perform study visit 18 (week 56) and/or visit 23 (week 76) imaging exams employing only 
whole -body low -dose CT scans.  Assessment of imaging endpoints without the PET scan may be 
implemented to mitigate the delay to  acquire images due to the inaccessibility to PET/CT imaging 
centers and/or unavailability of the 18F-NaF tracer.  In addition, the window for the week 56 
imaging assessments can be flexible (eg, as soon as feasible or later when possible) to respond to 
COVID-19 related travel restrictions.  This low -dose CT scan may be performed by trained staff

8.2.3.  Clinical Endpoint Measures  
With the exception of the Daily Pain NRS and FOP disease activity e -diary, if a study ques tionnaire 
is not available in a patient’s native language at the time of enrollment that questionnaire will not 
be part of the required study procedures for that patient.  
8.2.3.1.  Numeric Rating Scale Pain Evaluation  
The NRS is a categorical rating scale used by patients to rate their pain associated with FOP.  
Patients will be asked to rate their pain on a scale that ranges from “0” (no pain) to “10” (worst 
possible pain).  The NRS measurements will be performed at the screening and baseline visits, and 
daily thr oughout the study and the results recorded in the e -diary device.  Patients and their 
caregiver (if applicable) will be trained on its use at the screening/baseline visit ( Section  8.1) and 
are instructed to record their current, least, and worst pain scores in the e -diary each day throughout 
the study.  The average of the 3 ratings will be used to represent the patient’s level of pain over 
the previous  24 hours ( McCaffery 1989 ).  Completion of the Daily Pain NRS will be reviewed at 
the visits listed in Section  8.1.  The baseline entry for the daily pain NRS diary is day -1. 
8.2.3.2.  FOP Disease Activity Assessment  
Assessment of FOP disease activity, including flare -up location, frequency, and duration, as well 
as the severity of selected FOP disease signs and symptoms, incl uding pain, swelling, joint 
stiffness, and decrease in movement which will be rated by patients using a 4 -point scale for each 
(0: no symptom; 1: mild; 2: moderate; 3: severe).  
Patients and their caregiver (if applicable) will be trained on its use at the screening/baseline visit 
(Section  8.1) and are instructed to record their scores in the e -diary each day throughout the study.  
The FOP disease activ ity diary will be reviewed at the visits listed in Section  8.1.  The baseline 
entry for the daily FOP disease activity diary is day -1. 
8.2.3.3.  FOP Independent Activities of Daily Living  
Patient reported ability to independently perform activities of daily livin g (I-ADL) will be assessed 
via a questionnaire, FOP I -ADL.  Questions in the FOP I -ADL are selected from the PROMIS 
bank of questions.  For questions 1 to 24, each activity is rated from (1) “unable to do” to (5) 
“without any difficulty”, and for questions  25 to 28, each activity is rated from (1) “cannot do” to 
(5) “not at all” .  The FOP I -ADL will be reviewed at baseline and at the visits listed in Section  8.1.  
For languages where the FOP I -ADL questionnaire is not currently available in a validated form, 
patients will not complete this assessment during the course of the study.  
8.2.3.4.  EQ-5D-3L Questionnaire  
The EQ -5D-3L is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in 
order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal.  The EQ -
5D-3L as a measure of health related quality of life, defines health in terms of 5  dimensions:

CONFIDENTIAL  mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression.  Each dimension has 
3 ordinal levels of severity: absence of problems or issues with the specific dimension, eg, “no 
problems” (1), “some problems” (2), “severe problems” (3). Overall health state is d efined as a 5 -
digit number.  Health states defined by the 5 -dimensional classification can be converted into 
corresponding index scores that quantify health status, where 0 represents “death” and 1  represents 
“perfect health”.  In the final part of the EQ -5D-3L, participants are asked to rate “your own health 
state today” from 100 (best imaginable health state) to 0 (worst imaginable health state).  Patients 
will complete the questionnaire at time points according to Section  8.1.  For languages where the 
EQ-5D-3L questionnaire is not currently available in a validated form, patients will not complete 
this assessment during the course of the study.  
8.2.3.5.  Cumu lative Analog Joint Involvement Scale  
Physician assessment of joint involvement will be conducted using the CAJIS at the visits listed 
in Section  8.1.  The CAJIS is an assessment of 15 major joints; each major joint rated normal 
unaffected (0), affected (1), or completely functionally ankylosed (2) ( Kaplan 2017 ).  The total 
score ranges from 0 to 30.  Physicians at all si tes will undergo training for CAJIS assessment.  
8.2.3.6.  Pulmonary Function by Spirometry  
Forced vital capacity [FVC] and FEV1 [forced expiratory volume in 1 second] and the ratio of 
FEV1/FVC will be determined by spirometry in patients who are able to undergo this  procedure 
at baseline, week 28, week 56, and week 76.  
8.2.4.  Safety Procedures  
8.2.4.1.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including body temperature, blood pressure , heart rate, pulse, and respiration, will be 
collected at the visits specified in Section  8.1, and at the early termination visit, if applicable.  
Blood pressure will be measured from a consistent resting position.  
8.2.4.2.  Physical Examination  
A thorough and complete physical examination will be performed at the visits specified in 
Section  8.1, and at the early termination visit, if applicabl e.  Care should be taken to examine and 
assess any abnormalities that may be present, as indicated by the patient’s medical history.  
Targeted physical examinations may be performed, if appropriate, depending upon AEs and/or 
laboratory or ECG abnormalities . 
Physical exams for the screening visit may be conducted on a different day from the initial 
screening visit, as long as they are conducted within the screening window.  
8.2.4.3.  Menstrual History  
Assessment of menstrual cycle history for WoCBP will be conducted at  baseline and at the visits 
specified in Section  8.1 to identify any changes in occurrence, frequency, duration following study 
drug treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.4.4.  Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiograms should be performed before blood is drawn during visits requiring blood 
draws.  A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the visits specified in Section  8.1 and at the 
early termination visit, if applicable.  The ECG should be performed prior to administration of 
study drug, if these were to occur on the same day.  
Each ECG consists of a 10 -second recording of the 12  leads simultaneously, leading to a single 
12-lead ECG (25 mm/s, 10 mm/mV) printout with evaluation (HR, PR, QRS, RR, QT intervals, 
and QTc) including date, time, number of the patient, signature of the research physician, and at 
least 3 complexes for each  lead.  The automatic reading will be used for immediate safety 
assessment.  The investigator’s medical opinion and automatic values will be recorded in the 
electronic case report form (CRF).  
8.2.4.5.  Laboratory Testing  
Blood draws for laboratory testing at the scr eening visit will be collected in a fasted state (after an 
8-hour fast).  No other blood draw will require fasting.  Hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis 
testing samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory.  Detailed instructions for blood sample 
collection are located in the laboratory manual provided to study sites.

adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), growth hormone (GH), testosterone (total and free; male 
patients only), LH, FSH, estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4), 
amylase, and lipase.  
Blood or urine samples will be collected from female patients at the visits specified in Table  1 for 
a pregnancy test before study drug administration.  
A urinalysis and culture will be collected/performed if there is an AESI (only applicable to male 
patients).  
Blood samples will be collected at baseline and various timepoints (Table  1 and Table  2) for 
measurement of coagulat ion parameters (including, but not limited to activated partial 
thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, INR, thrombin time), fibrinogen, and platelet effector 
function.  For all patients who are currently enrolled in the study, blood samples will be collect ed 
prior to next administration of study drug for measurement of coagulation parameters (activated 
partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, INR, thrombin time), fibrinogen, and platelet 
effector function, unless these tests have been performed in the  past year.  These assessments will 
be conducted locally.  If possible, for patients with a moderate or severe AESI of epistaxis or other 
non-traumatic bleeding, the investigator should attempt to obtain an unscheduled assessment of 
coagulation parameters and platelet effector function as close as possible to the time of this AESI.  
Abnormal Laboratory Values and Laboratory Adverse Events  
• All laboratory values must be reviewed by the investigator or authorized designee.  
• Significantly abnormal test results t hat occur after start of treatment must be repeated 
to confirm the nature and degree of the abnormality.  When necessary, appropriate 
ancillary investigations should be initiated.  If the abnormality fails to resolve or cannot 
be explained by events or con ditions unrelated to the study medication or its 
administration, the medical monitor must be consulted.  
• The clinical significance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease 
under study, must be determined by the investigator.  
Criteria for  reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in Section  9.4.5 .

8.2.5.1.  Drug Concentration and Total  Activin A Concentration Measurements and 
Samples  
Serum samples for measurement of drug concentration and total activin A concentration will be 
collected at visits listed in Section  8.1.  Samples will be collected before dosing on days when 
study drug is administered.  
Any unused serum samples collected for drug concentration measurements may be used for 
exploratory biomarke r research (Section  8.2.6 ) or future biomedical research (see Section  8.2.7 ). 
8.2.5.2.  Anti -Drug Antibody Measurements and Samples  
Serum samples for ADA assessment will be collected at visits listed in Section  8.1.  Samples will 
be collected before dosing on days when study drug is administered.  Any unused serum samples 
collected for ADA assessments may be used for exploratory biomarker research (Sect ion 8.2.6 ) or 
future biomedical research (see Section  8.2.7 ). 
8.2.6.  Biomarker Procedures  
Blood samples for analysis of biomarkers and whole blood for RNA analysis will be collected at 
visits according to  Section  8.1.  The biomarkers studied will be ones considered to be relevant to 
the pathophysiology of FOP, target engagement, safety and the mechanism of action of anti -activin 
A treatment.  
Biomarker mea surements, including those of the biochemical bone formation markers and 
inflammation markers, will be performed in serum or plasma samples to discover and determine 
effects on biomarkers of FOP or on relevant physiological and pathogenic processes.  Bioma rkers 
studied may include but need not be limited to biochemical bone and cartilage formation markers 
(BSAP, osteocalcin, P1NP), Total Procollagen Type 1 C -Terminal Propeptide, matrix 
metalloproteinase 13, and type IIA procollagen amino terminal propeptide  or inflammation 
markers (hs -CRP).  The list may change, as it is recognized that more relevant or novel biomarkers 
may be discovered during the process of this study.  Investigators will be blinded to the bone 
biomarker data.  
Markers related to the Activi n A and the Activin receptor pathway including but not limited to 
Activin and BMP ligands may be explored to understand the impact to other ligands that signal 
through mutant ACVR1 and that may be impacted by REGN2477.  
RNA may be isolated from whole blood to evaluate the gene expression relating to the activin A 
pathway, FOP disease, other bone diseased related to HO, and anti -activin A treatment using 
methods that may include transcriptome sequencing.  
The RNA samples will be double -coded as defined by the International Council for Harmonisation  
(ICH) guideline E15.  
Samples (biomarker or RNA) may be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database 
lock and may be used for research purposes.  Any residual samples will be destroyed.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.2.7.  Future Biomed ical Research  
Additional serum and plasma will be banked for future biomedical research to further explore 
hormonal levels, biomarkers associated with FOP, bone and cartilage formation, and inflammation 
as specified in Section  8.2.6 , and with anti -activin A inhibition by REGN2477 ( Section  8.1), and 
in the event that additional biomarkers are discovered in the field of FOP research.  These 
biomarkers may be evaluated following completion of the study and will not be reported in the 
clinical study report.  
The biomarker samples for stud y-related research, as well as unused PK and ADA samples, will 
be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock.  The samples may be utilized 
for future biomedical research of FOP, and bone diseases related to HO.  No additional sampl es 
will be collected for future biomedical research.  After 15 years, any residual samples will be 
destroyed.  
8.2.7.1.  Optional Genomic Study: DNA Analysis  
Patients who agree to participate in the optional genomics sub -study will be required to sign a 
separate info rmed consent form (ICF) before collection of the sample.  Patients are not required to 
participate in the genomics sub -study in order to enroll in the primary study.  Blood samples for 
DNA extraction should be collected on day 1/baseline (pre -dose), but ma y be collected at any 
study visit after screening.  
The DNA sample for the sub -study will be double -coded as defined by the ICH guideline E15.  
Sub-study samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock and 
may be used for  research purposes.  The purpose of the genomic analyses is to identify genomic 
associations with clinical or biomarker responses, other clinical outcome measures and possible 
AEs.  In addition, associations between genomic variants and prognosis or progre ssion of FOP as 
well as other HO and bone diseases may also be studied.  These data may be used or combined 
with data collected from other studies to identify and validate genomic markers related to the 
REGN2477 or FOP, and other HO and bone diseases.  Ana lyses may include sequence 
determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of candidate genes and surrounding 
genomic regions. Other methods, including whole -exome sequencing, whole -genome sequencing, 
DNA copy number variation may also be performed .  The list of methods may be expanded to 
include novel methodology that may be developed during the course of this study or sample storage 
period.  The results of these analyses will be reported separately from the clinical study results.   
9. SAFETY DEFINITI ONS, REPORTING, AND MONITORING  
9.1. Obligations of Investigator  
The investigator must promptly report to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee 
(EC) all unanticipated problems involving risks to patients .  This includes death from any cause 
and a ll SAEs related to the use of the study drug.  It is recommended that all SAEs be reported to 
the IRB/EC, regardless of assessed  causality.

CONFIDENTIAL  9.2. Obligations of Sponsor  
During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner all SAEs that are 
both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug (suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction [SUSAR]), to the health authorities, IRBs/EC as appropriate, and to the 
investigators.  
Any AE not listed as an expected event in the IB or in this protocol will be considered unexpected.  
Any worsening of or new onset of symptoms related to FOP that occur during the 
screening/washout period prior to study drug administration will be considered expected.  
In addition, the sponsor will report in  an expedited manner all SAEs that are expected and at least 
reasonably related to the study drug to the health authorities, according to local regulations.  
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the clinical study report to health authorities and IRB/EC as appropriate.  
9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug, which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, which is 
temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.  
An AE a lso includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug.  
9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  In-
patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital or an emergency room for 
longer than 24 hours.  Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital 
stay that is longer than originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to the 
development of a new AE, as determined by the investigator or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
                                        VV-RIM-00123469-1.0 Approved - 28 Aug 2020 GMT-5:00

CONFIDENTIAL  • Is an important med ical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatme nt in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
Note:  In addition to the criteria above, a new diagnosis or progression of a malignancy in patients 
enrolled in the study will also be considered a SAE.  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  See Section  9.4 for more 
information on recording and reporting SAEs.  
9.3.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and  rapid communication by the investigator 
to the sponsor can be appropriate.  Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it.  Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by the 
trial sponsor to ot her parties (eg, regulators) might also be warranted (Section  9.4.3 ) 
9.3.4.  Infusion Reactions  
Infusion reactions are defined as any AE that occurs during t he infusion or within 2  hours after the 
infusion is completed.  All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (defined in Section  9.3) and 
graded u sing the grading scales as instructed in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
9.4.1.  Adverse Events  
The investigator (or designee) will record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent 
is signed until the end of study.  Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be 
followed.  
Information on follow -up for AEs is provided in Section  9.4.6 .  Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG 
abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs as outlined in Section  9.4.5 . 
9.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study drug, must be reported to the 
sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours.  Refer to the study reference manual for the procedure to 
be followed.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report.  
Substantiating data such as relevant hospital or medical records and diagnostic test reports may 
also be requested.

CONFIDENTIAL  In the event the investig ator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the study, the 
following will apply:  
• SAE with an onset within 30 days of the end of study  or within 113 days of last study 
drug administration if the patient was terminated early from the study:  the S AE will 
be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain follow -
up information on the outcome until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
• SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of study/early termin ation 
visit:  only fatal SAEs and those deemed by the investigator to be drug -related SAEs 
will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or  intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if 
associated with an AE.  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the  sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female or female partner of a male , during the study 
or within 30 week s of the last dose of study drug.  Any complication of pregnancy 
affecting a female study patient or female partner of a male study patient, and/or 
fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE.  
Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator 
will be provided a pregnancy tracking form and follow the pregnancy until delivery.  
If the pregnancy continues to term (delivery), the health of the infant will be 
followed -up for a period of 3 -months postnatally.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest:   All AESI , serious and non -serious, must be reported 
within 24 hours of identification using the same reporting process as for SAE 
reporting, per Section  9.4.2 . 
AESI for this program at current time are:  
• Epididymitis  
• Orchitis (inflammation of the testicles)  
• Hydrocele (fluid buildup around 1 or both testicles)  
• Scrotum pain  
• Scrotum swelling  
• Moderate to severe episodes of non -traumatic bleeding  
• Moderate epistaxi s (defined as any episode lasting longer than 30 minutes or 
requiring professional medical intervention)  
• Severe epistaxis (based on definition of a severe AE as described in Section  9.5.1 )

CONFIDENTIAL  Refer to the study manual for the procedures to be followed.  
9.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within 30 days.  
Refer to the study reference manual for the procedures to be followed.  
9.4.5.  Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should b e reported as an 
AE include:  
• the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
• the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
• the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding should 
be reported as a n AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  event info rmation will be collected until the  patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be  graded according to the following scale:  
• Mild:   Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning 
level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief 
of symptoms, but may be given because  of personality of the patient.  
• Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.

CONFIDENTIAL  • Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or in capacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the patient’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patient hospitalized.  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indi cates.  
Infusion Reactions  
The severity of infusion reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of the grade):  
• Mild :  Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated.  
• Moderate :  Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly to 
symptomatic treatment (eg, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids); prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤24 hours.  
• Severe :  Prolonged (eg, not rapidly responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief 
interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; 
hospitalization indicated for clinical sequelae; life -threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated; death.  
9.5.2.  Evaluat ion of Causality  
Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug:  
The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by the blinded investigator, and will be a 
clinical decision based on all available information.  The following question will be addressed :

Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators pa rticipating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the IB or this 
protocol, and  has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the medicinal/study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This Section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study.  The SAP may 
be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make 
changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned 
analyses.  The final SAP for Period 1 (double -blind treatment period; week 28) was issued before 
the database was locked ( 19 N ov 2019 for clinical results and 13 Dec 2019 for imaging results ).  
No changes have been made to the SAP with regard to the specified Period 1 analyses as those 
analyses have already been conducted.  
Prior to the DBL for Period 2 (open -label treatment perio d; week 56), an SAP amendment will be 
issued to present the definition of the separate study hypothesis for the open -label treatment period 
(week 28 to week 56; Period 2) and the new analyses to test efficacy of REGN2477 in preventing 
the formation of new HO lesions.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  4. 
10.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
10.1.1.  Statistical Hypothesis (Period 1 [Week 28])  
The primary efficacy en dpoints of the study are   
• Time -weighted average (standardized area under the curve [AUC]) of the percent 
change from baseline in total lesion activity by 18F-NaF PET over 28 weeks in AHO  
• Percent change from baseline in the total volume of HO lesions as as sessed by CT at 
week 28 in AHO  
• Time -weighted average (standardized area under the curve [AUC]) of the percent 
change from baseline in total lesion activity by 18F-NaF PET over 28 weeks in AHOC  
• Percent change from baseline in the total volume of HO lesions as assessed by CT at 
week 28 in AHOC  
The key secondary efficacy endpoints are  
• Time -weighted average (standardized AUC) of the change from baseline in daily pain 
due to FOP, as measured using the daily NRS over 28 weeks in AHO  
• Time -weighted average (standa rdized AUC) of the change from baseline in daily pain 
due to FOP, as measured using the daily NRS over 28 weeks in AHOC

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 102 of 126 
CONFIDENTIAL  The following null and alternative hypotheses will be tested for efficacy endpoints respectively:  
H0: No treatment difference between REGN  2477 and placebo  
H1: There is a treatment difference between REGN  2477 and placebo  
Testing of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will follow a hierarchical testing 
procedure to address multiplicity at an overall 2 -sided alpha=0.05 signif icance level.  Testing of 
the key secondary efficacy endpoints will follow a hierarchical testing sequence only if statistical 
significance is established for all primary endpoints.  The order of testing sequence for primary 
and key secondary efficacy endp oints is detailed in Section  10.4.3.1.4 .  No further adjustments 
will be made for other secondary and exploratory endpoints, for which nominal p -values will be 
provided for descriptive purpose only.  
10.1.2.  Statistical Hypothesis (Period 2 [Week 56])  
For the efficacy analyses in Period 2 (week 56), the key statistical comparisons will be based on 
within group (placebo/REGN2477) comparisons for the patients who  were randomized to placebo 
in the double -blind period and switch to REGN 2477 in the open -label period (Period 2).  
For the Period 2 (week 56) analyses, the following primary and key secondary null hypotheses 
will be tested:  
• H1,1: There is no difference i n number of new (relative to week 28 scan) HO lesions as 
assessed by CT per patient at week 56 compared to the number of new (relative to 
baseline scan) HO lesions as assessed by CT per patient at week 28 in 
placebo/REGN2477 group in AHO (primary)  
• H2,1: There is no difference in total volume of new (relative to week 28 scan) HO lesions 
per patient as assessed by CT at week 56 compared to the total volume of new (relative 
to baseline scan) HO lesions per patient as assessed by CT at week 28 in 
placebo/REGN24 77 group in AHO (key secondary)

CONFIDENTIAL  To control the type -I erro r rate at 0.10 for the primary and key secondary null hypotheses in 
Period  2, a hierarchical testing procedure will be applied at a 2 -sided 10% significant level as 
detailed in Section  10.4.3.2.4 .  No further adjustments will be made for other secondary and 
exploratory endpoints in Period 2, for which estimates, 95% CI, and/or nominal p -values will be 
provided for descriptive purpose.  
10.2. Justification of S ample Size  
Randomization will be stratified by the presence/absence of active HO lesions at baseline, to allow 
analyses of efficacy endpoint measures defined solely for patients with active HO at baseline 
(Section  10.3.1 ).  Patients without active HO lesions at baseline will contribute to the assessment 
of safety and other endpoint measures ( Section  10.3.4 , Section  10.3.3 ).  Randomization will also 
be stratified by gender and classic ACVR 1[R206H] mutation/different ACVR1 mutations.  
The sample size estimation for at least 24 patients (12 patients per treatment group) with active 
HO at baseline and classic ACVR1[R206H] mutation is based on statistical considerations for the 
following efficac y endpoints: percent change from baseline in (1) total lesion activity by 18F-NaF 
PET over 28  weeks, (2) total volume of HO lesion by CT at week 28, and (3) 18F-NaF SUV max at 
week 8.  Accounting for a 20% dropout rate at week 28, the sample size would yiel d approximately 
10 patients per treatment group for week -28 analyses.  This sample size will provide 80% power 
at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level in allowing the detection of an observed treatment difference 
in the order of 57%, 65%, and 40% reduction in  the total lesion activity by 18F-NaF PET, the total 
volume of HO lesion by CT, and the 18F-NaF SUV max, respectively, if the measure variability in 
FOP patients is similar to that observed in other bone diseases and the FOP mouse model ( Table  4).  
Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that different mutations in the ACVR1 receptor transduced 
BMP signaling when stimulated with activin A ( Hino 2015 ).  These results suggest that 
REGN2477 may provide beneficial clinical impact on HO in patients with FOP, irrespective of 
the underlying ACVR1 mutation.  
No prior published data on treatment effects in patients with FOP using these endpoints are 
available; however, numerous case reports show positive 99mTc methylene diphosphonate (MDP) 
bone scan, as well as an abnormally high 18F-NaF PET signal in a small c ohort of patients with 
FOP at the site of flare -up and "asymptomatic" locations.  
There is no precedent in patients with FOP to allow estimation of variance or clinically meaningful 
effect sizes for these endpoints. Based on studies in other bone diseases i n human and in the FOP 
mice, changes are estimated at a magnitude of 73% for the total lesion activity by  18F-NaF PET, 
65% for the total volume of HO lesion by CT, and 50% for 18F-NaF SUV max PET.  
There are 18F-NaF PET (SUV max) data available from a bisphos phonate treatment study of 
14 patients with Paget's disease ( Installe 2005 ). In this study, 18F-NaF PET/CT was used to monitor 
treatment effects on bone. The SUV max and bone influx constants (Ki) were found to be 
significan tly higher in Pagetic bone than normal bone (mean±SD are 35.07±23.86 vs. 7.15±4.76 
and 0.114±0.115 vs. 0.014±0.008 mL/min/mL, respectively, where p<0.05 for both measures). 
Following treatment with bisphosphonates, a significant reduction of PET signal in Pagetic bone 
was observed compared to baseline ( -27.84±24.59% at 1 month and -44.64±23.61% at 6  months, 
P<0.05 at both time points ( Installe 2005 ). These data yielded a log -scale SD~0.36 for 1 -month 
change. Assuming a 50% r eduction by REGN2477 versus placebo in total lesion activity by 
18F-NaF SUV max PET and a log -scale SD~0.36, the sample size required for week -28 analysis

CONFIDENTIAL  assuming the effect size of 1.9 is 6 patients with active lesion per arm for 80% power at a 2 -sided 
0.05 significance level.  
Prior data for total lesion activity by 18F-NaF PET and total volume of HO lesion by CT in FOP 
are available only in mice.  
REGN2477 treatment yielded an effect size of 2.2 and a log -scale SD of approximately 0.60 in 
reducing induced HO total lesion activity in mice as measured by 18F-NaF PET AUC. Assuming 
an effect size of 2.2, the sample size required for week -28 analysis is 5 patients with active lesion 
per arm for 80% power at a 2 -sided 0.05 significance level.  
Effect sizes for tot al volume of HO by CT ranged 0.9  to 1.4 with a log -scale SD of 0.75 to 1.0. 
Assuming larger effect size of 1.4 and smaller log -scale SD of 0.75, the required sample size for 
week -28 analysis is 10 patients with active lesion per arm for 80% power at a 2 -sided 0.05 
significance level.  
Considering that FOP is a rare disease and the robust preclinical efficacy of REGN2477, in the 
interest of maintaining smallest reasonable sample size, larger target effect sizes are used to 
compute power for potential sample s ize for this study.  The calculations, which were carried out 
on log -scale (ie, ln[post/pre]) and back -transformed to express differences in percent change scale, 
are summarized in Table  4.

CONFIDENTIAL  10.4.3.1.1.  Primary Endpoints:  Total Lesion Activity by 18F-NaF PET  
For 18F-NaF uptake at HO site, measured by SUV, the following analysis is planned:  
• All active HO lesions per patient will be i dentified and indexed at baseline. Up to 
7 lesions will be identified as target lesions, and their associated 18F-NaF SUV mean, 
SUV max by PET, and their volume by CT will be derived.  These index lesions will be 
assessed again on the post -dose treatment per iod visit scans.  New lesions that arise 
during the post -dose treatment period will be assessed similarly.  
• Total lesion activity by PET per patient will be derived for each time point as the sum 
of individual target HO lesion SUV mean x metabolic volume.  P ercent time weighted 
average (standardized AUC, ie, AUC divided by 28) of percent change from baseline 
will be calculated for each patient as the AUC of percent change from baseline in total 
lesion activity by 18F-NaF PET over 28 weeks divided by 28. The A NCOVA model 
will be used to analyze time weighted average of percent change over 28 weeks.  The 
model will include treatment, gender, ACVR1 mutation type (classic, nonclassic) and 
baseline total lesion activity as a covariate.  In case of substantial imbal ance at baseline 
in the number of patients in the randomization strata: gender, ACVR1 mutation type, 
strata factor(s) may be excluded from the model.  If both imaging scans at week 8 and 
28 are missing, then mean of percent changes of placebo group at week  8 and 28 will 
be used for imputation.  If imaging scan for only week 8 is missing, linear interpolation 
of percent change between the baseline and week 28 will be used to calculate AUC.  If 
imaging scan for week 28 is missing, percent change at week 8 wil l be carried forward 
to week 28 for calculating AUC.  
10.4.3.1.2.  Primary Endpoints: Total HO Volume by CT  
• Total HO volume by CT in each patient will be derived for each time point as the Sum 
of all individual HO lesion volume  
• Percent change from baseline in the tota l volume of HO lesions as assessed by CT at 
week 28 will be analyzed in AHO or AHOC using MMRM model.  The model will

treatment -by-time point interaction, as well as, the cont inuous fixed covariates of 
baseline value.  In case of substantial imbalance at baseline in the number of patients 
in the randomization strata: gender, ACVR1 mutation type, strata factor(s) may be 
excluded from the model.  An unstructured covariance matrix  can be used in this model

hierarchical testing procedure will be applied at a 2-sided 5% significance level.  Key secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be tested in a (hierarchical order after all primary efficacy endpoints 
achieve statistical significance at an overall 2 -sided alpha=0.05 significance level. The testing 
sequence is as f ollows:  
Time -weighted average (standardized AUC) of the percent change from baseline in 
total lesion activity by18F-NaF PET over 28 weeks in AHO  
 
Percent change from baseline in the total volume of HO lesions as assessed by CT at

Sensitivity analy ses will be performed for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints when 
misclassification of ACVR1 mutation type occurs.  
10.4.3.2.  Analysis of Efficacy Endpoints in Period 2 (Week 56)  
In the placebo/REGN2477 group (placebo patients who switch to REGN2477 after the 
double -blind period), efficacy analyses will focus on the within group statistical comparisons of 
Period 1 versus Period 2.  
The COVID -19 pandemic has affected the conduct of the study mainly by causing delay in dose 
administration, delay in the c ollection of the PET/CT scans due to site closure, and unavailability 
of 18F-NaF due to interruption of tracer production. Some patients may not be able to complete 
their week 56 scans within the protocol -specified visit window and may only be able complet e 
their scans using CT -only modality.

CONFIDENTIAL  The week 56 efficacy analyses of imaging endpoints will be conducted using COVID -19 modified 
Intent -To-Treat (COVID -19 mITT) principle which will analyze only those patients for whom:  
• at least 1 post -week 28 scan is collected and,  
• the time period between any 2 consecutive doses is less than 9 weeks (63 days) in 
Period 2 and,  
• no more than 1 dose was missed in Period 2  
This will ensure that primary analyses for imaging endpoints will include patients with continuous 
saturating levels of REGN2477. For patients whose week 56 scans are delayed, the first delayed 
scan available after the week 28 scan will be used to impute the week 56 data in the primary 
analyses. In the absence of a PET/CT scan, data from available CT -only scans will be used to 
analyze the primary endpoint and other secondary imaging endpoints, if applicable. This 
imputation ensures that the estimation of the treatment effect will not be biased by the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
In the REGN2477/REGN2477 group (patien ts who continue receiving REGN2477 beyond 
week  28), the estimates of treatment effects at week 56 will be provided with 95% confidence

double -blind study drug will be presented by specific time periods for each treatment group.  The 
time periods of interest will be specified in t he SAP.  In addition, duration of exposure during the 
study will be summarized for each treatment group using number of patients, means, SD, 
minimums, medians, and maximums.  A summary of the number of doses by treatment group will 
be provided.  
10.4.4.4.  Treatment C ompliance  
Compliance with protocol -defined investigational product will be calculated as follows:  
Treatment compliance = (Number of injections of study drug during exposure period)/(Number of 
planned injections of study drug during exposure period on or b efore the time that the patient 
discontinues from the study) x 100%.  
Treatment compliance will be presented by specific ranges for each treatment group.  The ranges 
of interest will be specified in the SAP.

generated.  Levels of biomarkers including mean and medians will be evaluated for change from 
baseline through the end of the study.  
Biomarker endpoints may be further assessed using an MMRM based on log -transformed data.  
Results will be back -transformed and expressed as percent change from baseline for each 
treatment. Time weighted average (standardized AUC) may be compared between treatments if 
appropriate.  
10.5. Primary and Additional Analysis  
Primary analysis of safety and efficacy data of the randomized dou ble-blind placebo -controlled 
period (Period 1) of the study will be performed once all data have been collected and validated 
through the end of this period (Period 1, week 28; DBL 1).  Additional analyses of safety and 
efficacy data will be performed foll owing the open -label REGN2477 treatment (Period 2, week  56; 
DBL 2), and at the end of the follow -up treatment period at week 76 (Period 3, week 76; DBL 3).  
Since the key efficacy measure data collection for Period 1 will have been concluded at the time 
of the first analysis (Period 1, week 28 ; DBL 1) and the radiographic data for subsequent periods 
had not been read nor entered into the database , the final analysis for Period 1 for subsequent 
periods is not considered an interim analysis and no multiplicit y adjustments are needed.   
10.6. Additional Statistical Data Handling Conventions  
The following analysis and data conventions will be followed:  
Definition of baseline:  
• Unless otherwise specified, the baseline assessment for all measurements will be the 
latest available valid measurement taken prior to the administration of investigational 
product.

CONFIDENTIAL  General rules for handling missing safety data:  
• If the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is incomplete or missing, it will 
be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study medication, except if an 
incomplete date (eg, month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to 
treatment.  If the partial date indicates the same month or year of the intake of study 
medication date, then the s tart date by the study medication intake date will be imputed; 
otherwise, the missing day or month by the first day or the first month will be imputed.  
• No imputations for missing laboratory data, ECG data, vital sign data, or physical 
examination data will  be made.  
10.7. Statistical Considerations Surrounding the Premature Termination 
of a Study  
If the study is terminated prematurely, only those parameters required for the development

14. ETHICAL A ND REGULATORY CONSID ERATIONS  
14.1. Good Clinical Practice Statement  
It is the responsibility of both the sponsor and the investigator(s) to ensure that this clinical study 
will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki, and that are consistent with the ICH guidelines for GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
14.2. Informed Consent  
The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP.  
The ICF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to 
submission to the appropriate IRB/EC.  A copy of the IRB/EC -approved ICF and documentation 
of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study site.  
It is the responsibili ty of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain 
written informed consent from each patient prior to his/her participation in the study and after the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been e xplained to the patient in 
language that he/she can understand.  The ICF should be signed and dated by the patient and by 
the investigator or authorized designee who reviewed the ICF with the patient.  
• Patients who can write but cannot read will have the IC F read to them before signing 
and dating the ICF.  
• Patients who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read 
to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to confirm 
that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient's study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the ICF must 
be reviewed and updated appropriately.  All study patients must be informed of the new 
information and provide their written consent if they wish to continue in the study.  The original 
signed revised ICF must be maintained in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to 
the patient.  
14.3. Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
patient will be maintained.  Patients should be identified by their patient identification number, 
only, on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor.  Documents that will not be submitted 
to the sponsor (eg, signed ICF) must be kept in strict confidence.

30 days’ notice.  The final decision should be made through mutual agreement with the sponsor.  
Both parties will a rrange the close -out procedures after review and consultation.  
Sponsor’s Decision  
The sponsor will notify the investigator(s) of a decision to close -out a study site in writing.  
Reasons may include the following, among others:  
• The investigator has receiv ed all items and information necessary to perform the study, 
but has not enrolled any patient within a reasonable period of time  
• The investigator has violated any fundamental obligation in the study agreement, 
including but not limited to, breach of this p rotocol (and any applicable amendments), 
breach of the applicable laws and regulations, or breach of any applicable ICH 
guidelines  
• The total number of patients required for the study are enrolled earlier than expected

CONFIDENTIAL  22. INVESTIGATOR’S AGREE MENT  
I have read the attached protocol: “A Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study to Assess the Safety, 
Tolerability, Ph armacokinetics, and Effects on Heterotopic Bone Formation of REGN2477 in 
Patients with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva” , and agree to abide by all provisions set forth 
therein.  
I agree to comply with the current International Council for Harmonisatio n Guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice and the laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines of the community, country, state, 
or locality relating to the conduct of the clinical study.  
I also agree that persons debarred from conducting or working on clinical studies by any court or 
regulatory agency will not be allowed to conduct or work on studies for the sponsor or a partnership 
in which the sponsor is involved.  I will immediately disclose it in writing to the sponsor if any 
person who is involved in the st udy is debarred, or if any proceeding for debarment is pending, or, 
to the best of my knowledge, threatened.  
This document contains confidential information of the sponsor, which must not be disclosed to 
anyone other than the recipient study staff and memb ers of the IRB/EC.  I agree to ensure that this 
information will not be used for any purpose other than the evaluation or conduct of the clinical 
investigation without the prior written consent of the sponsor.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  1. FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN ASSESSING THE 
RELATIONSHIP OF ADVE RSE EVENTS TO STUDY 
DRUG AND STUDY CONDU CT  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug or study 
conduct?  
No: 
• due to external causes such  as environmental factors or other treatment(s) being 
administered  
• due to the patient’s disease state or clinical condition  
• do not follow a reasonable temporal sequence following the time of administration of 
the dose of study drug  
• do not reappear or wors en when dosing with study drug is resumed  
• are not a suspected response to the study drug based upon preclinical data or prior 
clinical data  
Yes: 
• could not be explained by environmental factors or other treatment(s) being 
administered  
• could not be explained  by the patient’s disease state or clinical condition  
• follow a reasonable temporal sequence following the time of administration of the dose 
of study drug  
• resolve or improve after discontinuation of study drug  
• reappear or worsen when dosing with study dr ug is resumed  
• are known or suspected to be a response to the study drug based upon preclinical data 
or prior clinical data

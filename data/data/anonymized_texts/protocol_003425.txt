Study Title  
CAPABLE Transition s: A Home Health Agency -Based Intervention to Optimize the 
Hospital or Post-Acute Care  Facility -to-Home T ransition  
Objectives  
This study’s primary objective is to serve as a feasibility study  of an intervention to assist 
older adults in the hospital or post-acute care  facility -to-home transition and to  test and 
refine procedures  as they relate to:  
• screening, enrollment, and retention of study participants  
• fidelity to and perceived benefit  of the intervention  
• data completeness with regard to our intermediate and primary outcomes  
This stud y’s secondary objective is  to obtain preliminary data on home time, quality of life, 
and health care utilization  at three and six months  following  post-acute care facility 
discharge.  
Design and Outcomes  
This study  is a randomized, care -as-usual  (CAU) -comparator , unblinded clinical trial of an 
occupational therapy  (OT)-led in -home intervention designed to help older adults with and 
without dementia successfully transi tion to their homes following a  hospital or  post-acute 
care facility discharge. In total, we plan to recruit 60 adults  (36 in the  intervention and 24 
in the CAU arms)  aged 65 years and older recently discharged  from a hospital or  post-
acute care facility  and admitted to a Medicare -certified home health agency ( CHHA ). 
Throughout the study, we will continually seek to enhance and optimize the study protocol 
and procedures to enhance recruitment . Our pilot study’s main  outco mes relate to the 
feasibility of the study. These outcomes include study recruitment and retention, fidelity to 
and perceived ben efit of the intervention, and data completeness with regard to our 
intermediate and primary clinical outcomes (home time, quality of life, health care 
utilization ). We will assess participants at the  time of study enrollment and three and six 
months following hospital or post-acute care facility discharge with a combination of in -
person interviews and review of medical health records.  
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 2  
Interventions and Duration  
CAPABLE Transitions : The intervention group will receive  an OT -led multidisciplinary in -
home intervention in which the study OT ( <6 visits), RN ( <5 visits), and handyworker  (<2 
visits)  work with participants over three  months. Study staff will follow participants for six 
months with assessment s occurring at study enrollment as well as three and six  months 
following hospital or post -acute care facility  discharge. The intervention group also will 
receive CHHA CAU services.  Figure 1  only shows the intervention and assessment 
sessions (CHHA CAU are  not shown).  
Care -as-Usual : The comparator group, receives CHHA  CAU  services, which can include  
nursing, home health aide, medical social work, and occupational,  physical , and speech 
therapy services . CHHA clinicians will determine the types and duration of services that 
CHHA clients in this group receive, which will be completely independent of the research 
study.  The duration of CHHA can vary dramatically across CHHA clients (e.g., range from 
a single visit to having  weekly visits for more than a year). Regardless of the types or 
duration of CHHA services received, s tudy staff will follow the CAU group for six months 
with assessments occ urring at study enrollment as well as three and six  months following 
hospital or  post-acute care facility discharge.  Even if study participants are receiving 
CHHA CAU services beyond six months, participation in the  research  study will end at the 
sixth month assessment.  
Sample Size and Population  
Our target populatio n consists of English-speaking adults aged 65 years and older  with 
and without dementia  who live in the Rochester region and are admitted to a CHHA 
following a  hospitalization or  post-acute care facility stay. We  will continue to  revise the  
study protocol  as needed  to enhance recruitment . We will utilize a stratified random 
permuted block method of randomization .1 Study staff will stratify participants into two 
groups based on the presence or absence of moderate or severe cognitive impairment  as 
determined by a Mini -Mental Status Exam (MMSE)  score . Following stratificati on, the 
study will use permuted block  randomization  to randomize participants to the intervention 
or CAU groups ). We thereby  anticipate enrolling 60 participants in this pilot study.

Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 5 1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
This study’s primary objective is to serve as a feasibility study  of an intervention to assist 
older adults in the hospital or post-acute care  facility -to-home transition and to  test and 
refine procedures  as they relate to:  
• screening, enrollment, and retention of study participants  
• fidelity to and perceived benefit  of the intervention  
• data completeness with regard to our intermediate and primary outcomes  
Achieving this objective will inform the development of a larger clinical trial . This larger 
clinical trial will test the hypothesis that, among older adults discharged from hospitals or 
post-acute facilities  (e.g., inpatient  rehabilitation facilities and skilled nursing  facilities ) and 
admitted to a CHHA , those who receive CAPABLE Transitions  will spend more days alive 
in their homes, have a higher quality of life, and have decreased utilization of emergency 
department, acute medical, and SNF care  compared to older adults who receive CHHA 
CAU . 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
This study’s secondary objectives are to obtain preliminary data on home time, quality of 
life, and hea lth care utilization  at three and six  months following hospital or post-acute 
care facility discharge.  
2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Hospital and Post -Acute Care  Facility -to-Home Transition s 
Older adult s with chronic illnesses often experience repe ated transitions in care , especially 
people  with dementia .2-6 These transitions  can be burdensome to individuals and their 
caregivers7 and are associated with complications, health status decli ne, and poor quality 
of care .2, 8-10 In 2018, 1.6 million fee -for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries used SNFs  
at least once.11 Although 84% of those admitted to SNFs desire community discharge,12 
only 56% of post -acute care SNF admissions are discharged to the community within 100 
days.13 Even among those discharged from the SNF, many struggle with the transition 
back to the community.14, 15 For instance, among older adult po st-acute SNF care 
Medicare beneficiaries in North and South Carolina, 22% use acute services within 30 
days of SNF discharge (67% of whom were rehospitalized).14 There is also wide variation 
in discharge outcomes between higher and lower performing SNFs (e.g., 30 -day 
potentially avoidable readmission rates of 3.9% and 7.8% for the 25th and 75th 
percentiles),11 indicating an opportunity for improving discharge outcomes. Furthermore, 
if SNF discharge outcomes were improved, SNF provide rs may be more willing to 
discharge “high -risk” patients to the community, potentially resulting in fewer post -acute 
care SNF patients transitioning to nursing home long -term care.  
2.2 Study Rationale  
There are numerous barriers to a successful hospital and po st-acute care facility -
to-home discharge : Although care transitions are common among older adults,3-5 these 
transitions are fraught with risk that older adults and their caregivers may be poorly 
prepared to manage.7 The reasons why many older adults struggle with the hospital or 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 6 post-acute care facility -to-home transition are complex and multifactorial. For example, 
patient -level (e.g., male gender, cognitive im pairment, functional impairment, Medicaid 
eligibility) and SNF -level (e.g., SNF quality) factors can affect an older adult’s ability to 
return to and remain in the community.14, 16 -22 Additionally, f ollowing discharge, the medical 
care of the older adult must transfer from the hospital or SNF providers to the PCP and 
other outpatient medical  providers in a timely and effective manner, and there can be 
breakdowns in communication between health care providers. Transitions of care also can 
exacerbate medication -related issues7 (e.g., ability to manage medications, redundant 
medications). Furthermore, unmet health -related social needs are frequently overlooked 
during health care transitions and can negatively affect health outcomes and services 
utilization.23 Many older adults discharged from the hospital or post-acute SNF care also  
have had a significant medical event that has decreased their level of functioning, placing 
their ability to manage in the homes at risk. Over the past two decades, there have been 
many efforts to address these issues to improve  care transitions – efforts that have 
successfully reduced rehospitalizations, SNF readmissions, and mortality.24 
Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, many older adults were referred to home health 
agencies from SNFs . However, there is evidence that the pandemic is dramatically 
changing p ost-acute and home health care - in 2018, 66% of home agency referra ls 
nationally came from doctors’ offices .25 Due to the dramatic reduction in SNF referrals  to 
home health agencies  and in consideration of the likely dramatic post -acute care changes 
nationwide, our recruitment criteria will include referrals from hospitals, inpatient 
rehabilitation facilities, and skilled nursing facilities. A review of Medicare inpatient hospital 
claims from June 2020 estimates a 4.6% increase in home health care  compared to June 
2019 , and a 25.4% decrease in SNF discharges .26 Although we design ed our intervention 
with the SNF -to-home transition in mind, CAPABLE Transitions is a care transitions 
intervention that will work similarly in the hospital -to-home transition and would involve no 
additional modifications to do so.  
Care transition interventions overview and knowledge gap : Care transition 
interventions have included advanced practice nurses who serve as transition coaches,27-
29 nurse discharge coordinators,24, 30, 31 pharmacists,30 telemonitoring,32, 33 telephone 
support,32, 33 and home visits,24, 29, 33 which have emphasized educational components 
(e.g., medication self -management) and care coordination. Complex interventions 
targeting the patients’ capacity for self -care appear particularly effective34 as do 
interventions bridging pre - and post -discharge set tings.24 “The vast majority of care 
transitions literature has been hospital -focused…” ,24 however, and the evidence to inform 
post-acute care facility -to-home discharges, specifically, is limited . Additionally, many of 
the interventions designed for the hospital settings are too resource -intensive (e.g., 
reliance on nurse practitioners, pharmacists) for post-acute care SNFs to easily adapt and 
adopt. A 2015 review found onl y two SNF -based interventions designed to reduce hospital 
readmissions .35 Project ReEngineered Discharge  (“Project RED”) is one such intervention, 
which reduced 30 -day hospitalization following  SNF discharge from 18.9% to 10.2%. 
Although effective, this intervention is unlikely to be widely disseminated as it consists of 
11 components that necessitate comprehensively overhauling the SNF discharge process 
and requires actions by social workers, n urse practitioners, secretaries, nursing, and home 
care liaisons and coordinators.36 The second inter vention consisted of a specialized 
geriatric rehabilitation unit that included a comprehensive geriatric assessment, a 
geriatrician, a geriatric nurse practitioner, and follow -up telephone case management. A 
pilot study suggested that this intervention res ulted in fewer ED visits and hospital 
readmissions after SNF discharge.37 This pilot study was conducted in  2005 and, to our 
knowledge, has not been examined in a follow -up randomized clinical trial. Efforts are 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 7 underway to optimize the SNF -to-home transition, and Connect -Home is a four -step 
transitional care intervention to be delivered by SNF staff. Connect -Home’s four steps are 
as follows: step 1 is to create transition of care plan, step 2 consists of a care plan meeting, 
step 3 is to implement the care plan, and step 4 consists of a social worker calling the 
patient or caregiver within 72 hours of discharge .38 Overall, there is little empirical evidence 
on how to optimize the SNF-to-home transiti on, however. To our knowledge, no study has 
examined a CHHA -based intervention to assist older adults in transitioning from the SNF 
to home.  
To address this critical gap in knowledge and improve outcomes for older adults 
experiencing the SNF -to-home transi tion, we are proposing to conduct a pilot study of a 
targeted intervention, CAPABLE Transitions , which will assist older adults who are 
discharged not only from the hospital, but also from post -acute  care facilities (SNFs or 
inpatient rehabilitation facili ties) to CHHA  services in the community.  
Original CAPABLE : Community Aging in Place, Advancing Better Living for Elders  
(CAPABLE ) includes an interdisciplinary team of a registered nurse (RN), OT, and 
handyworker . The CAPABLE  intervention consists of an as sessment -driven, client -
specific package of interventions that ar e delivered over approximately four  months by an 
OT (<6 visits), RN ( <4 visits) and a handyworker  team.39 CAPABLE  has been shown to 
decrease ADL impairment (by 30% and 45% when compared to a n active control or 
baseline impairment, respectively ) 40 as well as home hazards and depression in 
community -dwell ing older adults.39, 41 CAPABLE  also reduces utilization of inpatient and 
outpatient medical services among older adults.42 CAPABLE  is becoming widely 
disseminat ed. Of note, CAPABLE  was originally designed for functionally limited, but 
medically stable and cognitively intact older adults. CAPABLE  excluded those who had 4 + 
hospitalizations in the prior 12 months or were receiving in -home physical therapy, OT, or 
nursing services. These exclusions are pertinent to older adults transitioning from the 
hospital or post-acute care  facility -to-home as this group has high levels of acute medical 
care use, cognitive impairment, and home health services utilization.14, 43 Wheth er 
CAPABLE  performs similarly in those with more acute medical needs and/or cognitive 
impairment is uncertain. It is also unclear whether CAPABLE  can be delivered from within 
a CHHA  organization . We therefore have developed CAPABLE Transitions , an 
interven tion that adapts CAPABLE  to this more vulnerable population, adds a transitions 
of care component, and is designed to be delivered within a CHHA.  
CAPABLE Transitions  – A home health agency -based intervention for older adults 
transitioning from the hospita l or post -acute care  facilit y to home : We have designed 
CAPABLE Transitions  to help older adults return to and remain in the community. Similar 
to CAPABLE , CAPABLE Transitions  consists of  an OT -led multidisciplinary team in which 
the study OT ( <6 visits), RN ( <5 visits), and  handyworker  (<2 visits) deliver an in -home 
intervention over approximately three  months. Also similar to CAPABLE , CAPABLE 
Transitions  aims to harness the older adult’s motivation by addressing functional goals 
that the older a dult or dyad prioritizes as well as changing home factors in support of these 
functional goals and to improve home safety. CAPABLE Transitions  expands upon 
CAPABLE , however, by also focusing on care transitions, and thereby has two core 
elements. The first  element consists of an RN-delivered brief care transitions intervention. 
The care transitions element is informed in part by Coleman’s Care Transitions 
Intervention Model.27 This element seeks to ensure connection to and communication with 
the PCP and outpatient medical services, to address barriers to medication management, 
and to screen for and link older adults to appropriate services for unmet health -related 
social needs.  
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 8 Whereas the first element primarily aims to facilitate the transfer of care from the  hospital 
or post-acute care facility to the outpatient and home settings, CAPABLE Transitions’  
second element seeks to optimize the ability of the older adults to functio n in their homes. 
To do so, we modified CAPABLE  in four ways. First, given the acuity of the older adults 
our intervention target s, the Study OT and RN  visits will occur more frequently in the first 
few weeks following the transition relative to the origin al CAPABLE  intervention  (e.g., 
every 1 -2 weeks rather than every 2 -4 weeks , with flexibility  to account for participant 
preference, participant availability (e.g., may be hospitalized), and varying CHHA clinical 
demands ). Second , following the transition h ome, all the CHHA clients in our study will be 
receiving CHHA nursing services and many also will be receiving CHHA OT services . For 
CHHA clients randomized to our intervention arm, in addition to CHHA RN +/ - CHHA OT 
services, they will receive CAPABLE Tra nsitions  RN and OT services delivered by the 
same CHHA RN and CHHA OT. The CAPABLE Transitions  intervention can be delivered 
either at the end of a CAU RN and OT in -home session or at a separate in -home visit.  Of 
note, CAPABLE Transitions’  OT services focu s on client -prioritized functional goals while 
CAPABLE Transitions’  RN services target client -prioritized conditions and syndromes that 
may be impairing function (e.g., depression, pain, incontinence) as well as fall prevention 
and communication with the PCP.  In contrast, CHHA CAU OT and RN services are 
generally directed by a physician’s order and tend to focus on a specific medical  problem 
identified by the physician (e.g., wound care, diabetes management, upper extremity 
mobility) . Third , our intervention will include those with moderate or severe cognitive 
impairment (including dementia) , regardless if they have live -in caregivers , who may 
potentially live alone . Optionally, we may deliver the intervention to  a caregiver -participa nt  
dyad , regardless of cognition , if there is a caregiver willing to serve as a study partner . An 
MMSE  score of 20 or less indicates that a  moderate or severe cognitive impairment is 
present.44, 45 ,86 Fourth , CHHA clients and dyads will determine the dose of the intervention 
and whether to participate in the various components of the intervention. T he different 
intervention components include:  
• RN care transitions home visit  
• OT comprehensive assessment and development of clien t-prioritized functional 
goals  
• client -OT work toward s addressing functional goals  
• handyworker  home safety repairs  
• handyworker  home modifications to support patien t-prioritized functional goals  
• RN in -depth assessment on pain, depression, strength/balance, medication 
concerns, and outpatient medical provider communication and development of 
client -prioritized goals as they relate to  these issues  
• client -RN work on addressing RN domain goals  
It is important to note that the services provided by the Study OT and RN differ from those 
offered by CHHA CAU OT and RN visits. Whereas CHHA CAU OT and RN services are 
often focused on a specific  problem or on disease management (e.g., diabetes, wound 
care, heart failure), Study OT and RN visits are designed to: 1) Let the client drive the 
treatment plan, 2) enhance client self -efficacy (e.g., change comes from the client), 3) 
customize treatment strategies to client -identified concerns, capabilities, and environment, 
4) address the environment (e.g., assess the clients’ functioning in their home), 5) 
coordinate with handyworker  services to optimize the environment for function and safety, 
and 6) focus on function rather than disease management.  
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 9 We expect that this clinical trial will present minimal risk to study participants. This study 
will involve questionnaires, interviews, function -focused physical activity and exercises, 
and examination of medical records for which the primary risk is invasion of privacy, 
breach of confidentiality, or the participants becoming fatigued or stressed.  
Theoretical foundation : Our intervention is based on several different theoretical 
foundations. First, Freedman’s Disability Framework (which is informed in part by the 
World Health Organization’s International Classification of Functioning and Disability, 
Nagi’s disability model, and others) ind icates that environment impacts an older adult’s 
health conditions, impairments, and capacity, which can in turn be mitigated by 
accommodations (e.g., changes to the environment, compensatory strategies).46 Second, 
Andersen’s Behavioral Model considers  how predisposing (e.g., sociodemographics), 
enabling (e.g., social support, environment, insurance), and need (e.g., medical 
conditions, functional and cognitive impairment) can impact health care access and 
utilization as well as health outcomes.47, 48 Third, the Cumulative Complexity Model 
considers how the balance of older adult workload (illness management requirements) 
and capacity (ability to manage illness) help determine (along with other factors) the 
success or failure of transitions of care.49 Lastly, we will draw upon Dr. Coleman’s Care 
Transitions Intervention framework, which identifies “four pillars” (e.g., medication self -

Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 10 Table 1. Overview of CAPABLE Transitions  – An Intervention to Optimize the  hospital or post -acute care facility -to-Home Transition  
Study Population : older adults with and without dementia admitted to a certified home health agency (CHHA) services after being discharged from a hospital 
or post-acute care facility .  
Inclusion Criteria : aged 65 years or older, English -speaking, admitted to CHHA  following a hospitaliza tion or post-acute  facility admission , live in  the 
Rochester, NY  region . 
Exclusion Criteria : have a terminal diagnosis, receiving active cancer treatment, plan to move within one year, and who are COVID -19 positive, have 
suspected COVID -19 infection, or resides with a person who is COVID -19 positive or has suspected COVID -19. 
Intervention Time Fr ame. Although we will have optimal visit timeframes, these timeframes  are guidelines . We expect that real -world situations will 
sometimes result in intervention visits that occur outside of these “optimal” timeframes :  
- OT Home Visits  (6 total visits) : 
#1 ideally as soon as possible after RN visit #1 (optimally within 1 -2 week s; may occasionally occur prior to RN visit #1 ),  
#2-4 optimally within  1-2 weeks  thereafter  OT visit #1 ,  
#5-6 optimally  within  3-4 weeks thereafter  OT visit #4,  
- Handyworker  Home Visits : as soon as possible after OT visit #2 (ideally completed within 3 weeks from CHHA admission , which typically occurs within 
several days of hospital or post-acute  care facility discharge ) 
- RN Home Visits  (5 total visits) :  
#1 will occur as soon as possible after CHHA admission  (optimally within 1 -2 week s),  
#2 optimall y within 1-2 weeks after RN  visit #1,  
#3-5 optimally within 2-4 every weeks thereafter  RN visit #2 . 
- As this is a feasibility study, we will have relatively broad study windows for when the intervention can be administered . The study int ervention will 
not extend past 5  months following hospital or post -acute care  facility  discharge, however. Of note, the intervention will be disc ontinued for study 
participants with a prolonged hospitalization as described in Section 8  of the protocol . 
- After each OT or RN visit, the study participants will be asked whether they would like to continue with the intervention.

Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 13 3 STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a randomized, CAU -comparator, unblinded clinical trial of an in -home 
multidisciplinary intervention, CAPABLE Transitions , designed to help older adults 
successfully transi tion to their homes following hospital or post-acute care facility 
discharge. We plan to conduct this study for three years and  to recruit 60 adults ( 36 in the 
intervention and  24 in the  CAU arms) aged 65  years and older  with and without dementia  
recently discharged from a hospital or  post-acute care facility and admitted to a CHHA. 
Prior to randomization, we will stratify the 60 participants based on the presence or 
absence of moderate or severe cognitive impairment. CAPABLE Transitions  consists of  
an OT -led multidisciplinary team in which the study OT ( <6 visits), RN ( <5 visits), and 
handyworker  (<2 visits) deliver an in -home intervention ov er three  months. Study staf f will 
follow participants for six  months with assessments oc curring at study enrollment as well 
as three and six  months —following hospital or post -acute care facility discharge.  
Our pilot study’s primary  outcomes relate to the feasibility of the study and include study 
recruitment and r etention, fidelity to and perceived benefit  of the intervention, and data 
completeness. The pilot study’s secondary outcomes are to obtain preliminary data on 
home time, quality of life, and health care utilization  at three and six months following 
hospital or post-acute care facility discharge . 
4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
This study’s target population is older adults living in an urban  area who are admitted to a 
CHHA after discharge from a hospital or post-acute  care facility . To participate in the study, 
with few exceptions (e.g., active cancer treatment, terminal diagnosis), there will be no 
restrictions based on sex, health status, or medical cond itions, and all of the following 
inclusion criteria must be met:  
• admitted to CHHA following  a hospitalization or  post-acute care facility stay (if 
not referred from CHHA , we will collect data on where  patient referral  is from)  
• live in the Rochester, NY  region  
• aged 65 years or older  
• English -speaking  
• agree to study participation  
We will deliver this intervention within a CHHA and with CHHA clinicians to enhance the 
scalability and the ease of dissemination if CAPABLE Transitions  is effe ctive.  However, it is 
acceptable if patients have been admitted and then discharged from CHHA within the 
screening timeframe, or if par ticipants  may be working with other CHHA (staff such as PT or 
OT) and do not curren tly have an assigned CHHA registered nurse .  
CHHA clients , regardless of their cognition, will have the option to include a study 
partner that may  live with the study subject and be a primary caregiver  to the study 
subject . Study partners may attend home visi ts and intervention sessions and be available 
via phone to answer questions from the research assistant.  If needed, they must be available 
for other information via phone to be obtained from study staff. They may be asked genera l 
questions (e.g., age, sex) and about  their relation ship to the study participants and the 
participant’s daily functioning, wellbeing, and health services use . 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 14 4.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
We will exclude p otential participants from study participation who do not s atisfy all of the 
inclusion criteria or meet any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline:  
• plan to move within one year  
• has a terminal diagnosis (e.g., <1 ye ar life expectancy, in hospice)  
• receiving active cancer treatment  (active treatment includes surgery or a 
course of radiation or chemotherapy; it does not include long -term 
maintenance treatment such as daily hormonal treatment of prostate cancer)  
• inability  or unwillingness of individual or legal guardian/representative to give 
written  informed consent . 
• has been discharge d to home  from a hospital or post-acute care facility for 
more than 28 days  
• are COVID -19 positive, have suspected COVID -19 infection, or resides with a 
person who is COVI D-19 positive or has suspected COVID -19. 
4. 3 Study  Enrollment Procedures  
We will recruit older adults newly admitted to UR Medicine Home Care  following discharge 
from a hospital or  post-acute care  facility . UR Medicine Home Care is a CHHA that 
provides se rvices to a six-county  region in Upstate New York.  
• Identification : The CHHA has clinical team s based on geographic region. The 
study OT and RN will be on the same CHHA team, which will be assigned to a 
region in Monroe County, NY  that includes the Rochester  region . The study RN 
and OT will regularly screen all of their CHHA intakes to identif y potential study 
participants  (e.g., discharged from post -acute care facility , does not have a 
terminal condition). The study RN  and study O T will ask clients passing the initial 
screen if they are interested in participating in our research study.  The study RN 
and OT will also offer participants a recruitment  brochure to introduce and provide 
information to home health patients if they are in terested.  For residents indicating 
an interest to participate in the research study  and agree to have a study staff 
member visit them to provide more information , the study RN , OT,  and CRC will 
work together to schedule an in -person screening visit that is  convenient to the 
potential participant.  In addition to the URMHC interventionists  recruiting 
participants  among their new admissions , we will contact potentially eligible 
URMHC clients who have indicated that they are interested in participating in 
resea rch when they complete the new consent process  via URMHC . This new 
consent process is for ALL URMHC patients admitted to URMHC services in which 
they can "opt in" or "opt out"  of being contacted by a UR researcher if there is a 
study they qualify for.  Only patients who have consented  will be contacted  by the 
CRC .  
• Study sample representativeness : At each stage of the screening and 
recruitment process,  we will document the proportion of CHHA clients  who are 
not eligible for our study, are not interested in p articipating in our study, or are 
lost to follow -up. For these CHHA clients we will only keep basic demographic 
information such as age, sex, and race and ethnicity to allow us to track those 
who do and do not participate in our study; those older than 89 will be grouped 
in a 90+ age category.  We will also utilize ICD -10 codes as part of the 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 15 screening process for the CHHA to help us identify participants that have 
dementia or cognitive impairment . However, we will not  base our recruitment 
criteria or num bers based on  this dementia category but will prioritize people 
with dementia.  This information will help us determine the representativeness 
of our study sample and to examine whether there are subgroups that are  
unlikely to participate in the study  (in w hich case, we made need to bolster 
recruitment efforts for certain subgroups ). 
• Consent procedures : As part of the consent process, study staff will 
systematically assess capacity for consent with a series of open -ended 
questions administered to the potenti al participant that follows explanation of 
the study  (see Det ermination of Consent Capacity F orm). These questions will 
address the participant’s knowledge and understanding of the study’s 
objectives, the voluntary nature of participation, ability to withd raw at any time, 
and possible risks and benefits of participation. For those unable to 
demonstrate capacity for consent, we will seek to obtain surrogate consent. 
Surrogate consent for dementia research is widely accepted by the general 
public,54, 55 and we will only enroll older adults with a surrogate consent if the 
older adult also assents to participate in the study  and the surrogate consenter 
is able to demonstrate capacity for consent . We will not enroll any older adult 
who is unable to demonst rate capacity to provide informed consent if they do 
not have surrogate consent available. Although we will not enroll these older 
adults, we will compensate them with  $10 for completing the screening 
procedures.  
• Randomization : Immediately following termi nation of the baseline 
assessment interview, study staff will random ly assign  participants via a 
stratified random permuted block method .1 Randomization will be stratified 
based on cognitive impairment status ( moderate/severe cognitive impairment 
present: MMSE score < 20; moderate/severe cognitive impairment absent: 
MMSE > 21).44, 45 ,86 Block randomization will then occur within each strata to 
ensure appropriate  allocation to the treatment and CAU groupings. REDCap56 
will track  the randomization groupings.  
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
CAPABLE Transitions  overview : CAPABLE Transitions is informed by theory and 
evidence -based practices (Table 1)  and consists of <11 in -home visits by an OT and RN 
over three  months. Every participant that completes the CAPABLE Transitions  
intervention will receive each component of the intervention (e.g., care transitions 
assistance, assessment, education, problem -solving activities), but the interventionists will 
tailor the content to each participant’s goals and risk profile. University of Rochester 
Medicine Home Care will document i nformation about study participation in the older 
adults’ electronic health records. Table 2 provides a detailed overview of the intervention 
timeline and content . The RN/OT visits will occur  as soon as possible following the 
minimum possible number  of wee ks after the prior visit.  The study visit  timeline will be 
flexible to accommodate for  both the interventionists and the participants needs . In 
instances where there is a deviat ion from our  protocol , we will complet e a Note to File in 
our regulatory file (e.g., if an interventionist is on sick leave or if the participant has been 
hospitalized).  To help ensure fidelity to the intervention, the Study OT and RN will 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 16 complete standardized training for CAPABLE  provided by Johns Hopkins School of 
Nursing. We will augment this training with training specific to CAPABLE Transitions  that 
accounts for the care transitions RN visit and other adaptations we are  making to 
CAPABLE  (e.g., increased frequency of visits early on, invol vement of a Study Partner).

Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 19 Intervention delivery characteristics : CAPABLE Transitions  consists of an OT -led 
multidisciplinary team in which the study OT ( <6 visits), RN ( <5 visits), and handyworker  
(<2 visits) deliver an in -home intervention over  approximately  three  months with each OT 
and RN visit lasting about  60-90 minutes.  The OT and RN visits are more frequent ear lier 
in the intervention to assist older adults with the hospital or post -acute care facility -to-
home  transition. We gradually increase the timing interval between visits so that 
participants have time to practice strategies or activities following the in -home sessions.  
All study participants who decide to receive the full dose of the intervention will receive a 
total of 6 OT visits and 5 RN visits. The number of handyworker  visits will depend on the 
modifications and repairs that are needed by the participant (e.g., if everything can be 
completed in 1 visit, then participants only will have 1 handyworker  visit). There may be 
rare instances for which the handyworker  visits the  home more than twice (e.g., perhaps 
the participant has a change in functioning during the course of the intervention that would 
benefit from an additional home modification).  Additionally,  the handyworker services may 
be unnecessary for all participants (e.g.,  some participants may decline handyworker 
services if they already live in an age -friendly home or community ). While receiving the 
study intervention, CHHA clients also will receive CAU from the CHHA (which may include 
OT services). The study OT and RN will be the same  clinicians who deliver CHHA CAU . 
To do so, they will either lengthen the CAU visit or have a separate visit solely for the 
intervention. Data from the CHHA indicate that the median length of a home health 
episode of care is 29 d ays (Q1: 17 days, Q3: 47 days).  For study participants who 
complete the CAPABLE Transitions  intervention, we anticipate that most will complete the 
OT and RN sessions in approximately 90 days , and  the intervention sessions will not 
continue past 5 months follo wing hospital or post -acute care facility discharge  (unless 
there is an exception noted in a Note to File document) . Therefore, we expect that the 
majority of study participants will have CHHA CAU that temporarily overlaps with the 
CAPABLE Transitions  intervention. We anticipate that there will be minimal “leakage” of 
the study intervention services to the CHHA CAU because the OT and RN actions for 
CAPABLE Transitions  will follow a manual based on CAPABLE  training  and these actions 
are markedly  different from their usual CHHA CAU roles .  
The clinical research coordinator  (CRC)  will maintain a  calendar to facilitate coordination 
of the intervention and ensure that study visits occur as detailed in the study protocol. A 
secure share site (UR Box) that can be remotely accessed will enhance communication 
between the OT, RN, and handyworker . This s ite also will enable study staff to monitor 
electronic documentation for study fidelity and to help assess study costs. The OT will 
have responsibility for case coordination with the  CHHA staff and  other interventionists 
and for  identifying the necessary supplies  to order , which include home modifications and 
repairs . Monthly to bimonthly meetings with the OT, RN, handyworker , CRC , and PI will 
ensure communication, adequate supervision, and appropriate fidelity to the interventio n. 
Of note, CHHA clients and dyads will determine the dose of the intervention (e.g., number 
of visits) and whether to participate in the various components of the intervention  (e.g., 
types of visits such as OT, RN, and handyworker  services) . More specifically, after each 
OT or RN visit, the study participants will be asked whether they would like to continue 
with the intervention. The study participants can thereby determine the dose of the 
intervention they receive as they can  discontinue par ticipation in the intervention at any 
time (see Section 8 for additional detail  regarding intervention discontinuation ), but still 
continue their participation in the study assessments . Our interventionists may also 
terminate the study intervention if iden tified goals are completed (or unable to be 
comp leted) and there are no further participant -interventionist agreed -upon goals to work 
on. 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 20 As previously stated , the study interventionists are practicing home health clinicians that 
are highly experienced wor king with older adults who have cognitive impairment. Our 
study’s goal is to improve home safety and functioning and the intervention is catered 
directly to the needs, ability, and goals of the participants – no two participants will receive 
the same inter vention. The clinicians will not have participants perform exercises or tasks 
that are unsafe or beyond their ability.  
 The different intervention components include:  
• RN care transitions home visit  
• OT comprehensive assessment and development of clien t-prioritized functional 
goals  
• client -OT work toward s addressing functional goals  
• handyworker  home safety repairs  
• handyworker  home modifications to support patien t-prioritized functional goals  
• RN in -depth assessment on pain, depression, strength/balance, medication 
concerns, and outpatient medical provider communication and development of 
client -prioritized goals as they relate to these issues  
• client -RN work on addressing RN domain goals  
Interve ntion protocol, OT : This OT intervention protocol was adapted from the original 
CAPABLE  intervention.40 The OT meets with participants for up to six sessions within 
approximately three months of randomization.   
In the 1st and 2nd OT sessions , the OT meets with participants and conducts a semi -
structured clinical interview using the Client -Clinician Assessment Protocol (C -CAP) that 
has been tested for its psychometric properties for use in home -based and home 
modification programs.57 The C -CAP provides a systematic approach from which to 
identify and prioritize performance areas that are problematic to participants. For each 
performan ce area identified, the OT observes the participant’s performance and evaluates 
safety, efficiency, difficulty, and presence of environmental barriers and supports. The OT 
will provide a three -ring binder ( CAPABLE  notebook) which will contain educational 
materials, contact information and a calendar to integrate the sessions by the RN and 
handyworker  interventionists.  Also,  in the course of this session, the OT assesses the 
environmental home safety (common safety and mobility risks include holes in walkway s, 
uneven carpeting, and absent railings or banisters). Based on the environmental 
assessment, observation of ADL activities, and identification of the participant’s goals, the 
OT and participant discuss possible environmental modifications. The OT then cr eates a 
list of agreed upon assistive devices and housing repairs for the handyworker .  
In 3rd, 4th, and 5th OT sessions , the OT engages the participant in problem -solving to 
identify behavioral and environmental contributors to performance difficulties and 
strategies for attaining functional goals. The OT trains participants to use specific 
strategies such as energy conser vation techniques, simplifying tasks and the environment, 
and using assistive devices. Also, the OT provides balance and fall recovery techniques 
to decrease fear of falling. In each session, the OT reinforces strategy use, reviews 
problem -solving, refines  strategies, and provides education and resources to address 
future needs. Home modifications (grab bars, rails, raised toilet seats) are coordinated 
with the handyworker  to assure that they are provided in a timely manner and meet the 
needs of the partici pant. The OT follows up with training in their use.  
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 21 In the final (6th) OT session , the OT reviews all techniques, strategies and devices, and 
helps the participant to generalize success to other situations.  
Intervention protocol, RN : This RN intervention protocol was adapted from the original 
CAPABLE  intervention.40 The RN meets with participants for up to five sessions within 
approximately three months of randomization.  
In the 1st RN session , the RN meets with the participants and works with the CHHA client 
to create a list of medical providers and scheduled appointments and to identify any 
barriers to attending outpatient medical appointments. The RN emphasizes the 
importance of follow -up outpatient appoin tments and works with the participant to address 
barriers to attending appointments or any questions the participants may have for the 
medical providers. At this initial visit, the RN also assesses the participant ’s medications 
as well as the participant’s  ability to manage her own medications and tailors intervention 
as indicated by the assessment.  Additionally, the RN will work with the participant to 
identify key symptoms and signs to monitor for that should prompt an urgent medical work -
up. Lastly, the RN conducts a health -related social needs screener and works with the 
participant to make appropriate referrals to community resources as needed.  
The 2nd RN session  occurs approximately 2-3 weeks after the first RN session. In this 
session, the RN assesse s the participant using the C -CAP RN developed specifically for 
CAPABLE in which the RN focuses on how and whether pain, depression, strength and 
balance, medication management , and communication with PCP impact daily function.58 
In this assessment, the RN and the participant identify and prioritize goals, and make plans 
to achieve those goals. The RN also adds educational resources to the CAPABLE 
notebook to reinforce its use as a resource.  
In the 3rd and 4th RN sessions , the RN and the participant work on the goals identified 
through the C -CAP RN. In each session, the RN reinforces strategy use, reviews problem -
solving, refines strategies, and provides education and resources to address future needs 
(e.g., pill box for medication  management).  
In the final (5th) RN session , the RN reviews the participant’ s strategies and helps to 
generalize them to other possible challenges.  
Intervention protocol, handyworker : This handyworker  intervention protocol was 
adapted from the original CAPABLE  intervention.40  
The hand worker portion is contracted through handyworker  services provided by a local 
non-profit aging services agency, Lifespan (Lifespan, Rochester, NY). Lifespan has a 
program entitled, “Home -Safe-Home,” which has been available to the community for over 
20 years.59 The Home -Safe-Home Program provides home modifications such as grab 
bars, tub grips, shower seats, handheld showers, commodes, railing modifications, and 
other simple yet effective modifications that reduce the risk o f falling. It modifies 
approximately 900 -1000 homes a year. This program is funded in part  through grants from 
various organizations. In an evaluation of this program, 82 (94%) of survey ed Home -Safe-
Home participants reported feeling more comfortable in th eir home since the home 
modifications and 57 (65.5%) reported increased independence, most frequently with 
bathing (68.4%), followed by use of the bathroom and stairs (49.1%).60 To deliver the 
Home -Safe-Home Program, Lifespan employs a handyworker  (the current handyworker  
has been in this role since 2014).  Upon agreeing to participate in this study and after being 
random ly assigned  to the CAPABLE Transitions  intervention arm, study participants will 
be enrolled in Lifespan’s Home -Safe-Home Program.  Lifespan also has liability insurance 
for this program and, should any participants have problems with the handyworker  
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 22 modifications  or installations, they can follow -up with Lifespan and the handyworker . Of 
note, study participants will not need to identify themselves to Lifespan as  they will be 
enrolled in the Home -Safe-Home Program via their participation in our study. Furthermore, 
the handyworker , Ken Posman, is Lifespan’s Home -Safe-Home Program coordinator and 
will be doing the handyworker  modifications for all of our study parti cipants. As such, 
additional  study  communication with Lifespan will not be needed as Lifespan will be fully 
aware of all of the study participants’ involvement in the Home -Safe-Home Program as 
well as their participation in our study. We will pay Lifespan to deliver the Home -Safe-
Home handyworker  services to our CAPABLE Transitions participants. The handyworker  
will help coordinate the ordering of the assistive devices as well as the repair and 
modification supplies. The handyworker  has extensive experience working with older 
adults in the area , and  will make as many home visits as it takes to provide the  study  
renov ations/modifications. The budget for home repairs, home modifications, and 
assistive devices is $1,200 per household, similar to CAPABLE’s $1,300,40 an amount that 
was adequate for most renovations necessary for safer, more functional homes.  We also 
have extra funds available if necessary,  for unusual situations (e.g., if we need to replace 
or repair equipment we purchased/installed during the course of the study).  
If home repairs or modifications outside the Handyworker’s scope of practice are indicated 
(e.g.,  plumbing, carpentry, or elect rical work ), participant compensation may include 
additional cash payments for home repair and modification services performed through 
Catholic Family Center’s HomeWorks Program. HomeWorks  is a program that provides 
low-cost home maintenance/repair support  to older adults.  These additional cash 
payments of $100 would cover the expense of enrolling in HomeWorks (for 3 months) and 
obtaining an initial estimate of the cost of the modifications/repairs and/or the expense of 
minor  home repairs and modifications that are recommended and agreed upon by our 
study interventionists and performed by Catholic Family Center's HomeWorks contractors.  
Of note, HomeWorks limits the maximum service charge to $500. As many of the 
participants may not have funds available to pay for the costs of these services upfront, 
the study team will provide this  compensation to the participants in cash prior to having 
the participants pay for these services  (maximum compensation for HomeWorks services 
would be $500 per parti cipant, and is included in the $1,200 budget for home 
repairs/modifications and assistive devices) . Participants will be notified at time of 
informed consent that depending on the amount they are paid, they may be asked to 
submit a W -9 form, which includes  their Social Security Number. No repairs or 
modifications to the participants’ home s, however, will be made without the participants’  
permission  
Similar  to above, if larger  home repairs or modifications outside of both Lifespan  and 
Catholic Family  Center’s scope of practice are indicated (e.g.,  masonry, bathroom 
remodeling ), participant compensation may include additional cash payments for home 
repair and modification servic es performed by  another person (e.g., a handy worker or 
separate contractor) or agency (e.g., bathroom modelers) within our allowed budget. This 
will allow participants to complete indicated home repairs or modifications that are outside 
the scope of both Lifespan and CFC capabilities. We will only reimburse participants for 
agreed upon repairs and modifications that are consistent with the objectives of the 
CAPABLE Transitions intervention . Additionally, we plan to obtain an estimate of the work 
prior to a greeing to reimburse it. These additional cash payments would cover obtaining 
an initial estimate of the cost of the modifications/repairs as well as the expense of the 
home repairs and modifications that are recommended and agreed upon by our study 
interv entionists and performed by these contractors or agencies . The total cost of these 
and other services provided to the participant will not exceed the $1,200 budget for home 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 23 repairs/modifications and assistive devices.  In unusual circumstances (e.g., much n eeded 
home safety repair), we  may also be able  to reimburse participants  for expenses 
exceeding $1,200 if necessary to  improve home safety or function and our budget allows.  
No repairs or modifications to the participants’ homes, however, will be made with out the 
participants’ permissi on. Participants will be responsible for any costs that are associated 
with maintaining or replacing these items following the termination of  the study . 
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
Study staff and interventionists will conduct CAPABLE Transitions  as outlined by this 
protocol.  This protocol has been adapted from the original CAPABLE  intervention with 
several notable changes. First, t he OT visits will occur more frequently in the first  few 
weeks following the transition relative to the original CAPABLE  intervention. Second , we 
will adapt CAPABLE Transitions so that CHHA OTs and RNs deliver the intervention within 
a CHHA setting. Third , our intervention will include those with moderate or severe 
cognitive impairment  who may live alone . If they have caregivers  interested and willing to 
participate , we may  deliver the inter vention to the dyad  consisting of an older adult 
regardless of cognition and their Study Partner . Some partic ipants with intact cognition 
may appreciate having a study partner available throughout the intervention .  Fourth , 
CHHA clients and dyads will determine the dose of the intervention and whether to 
participate in the various components of the intervention. We will offer flexibility for the 
intervention visits to meet the needs of the interventionists and the participa nts.  
The CRC  will systematically monitor the delivery of the intervention to make sure that the 
study interventionists are adhering  to the intervention’s protocol . Additionally, to help 
ensure fidelity to the intervention, the interventionists will receiv e standardized training 
offered through The Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing.61 This training will 
complement the content presented in the intervention’s protocol . Johns Hopkins University 
School of Nursing CAPABLE  Training courses include  the following (of note, no p erson 
identifiers of the study participants will be shared) :  
• Training manuals for RNs and OTs  
• OT and RN initial assessment forms  
• Documentation for ms for all ten home visits  
• Brainsto rming and action planning forms  
• CAPABLE exercise book, Health Passport, me dication calendar and items for 
participant's folders  
• Tip book for participants  
• Webinars for additional training and information sharing. These are offered live 
and recorded and archived by topic for later access  
• Office hours so trained clinicians, program  administrators and construction 
partners can ask questions, discuss challenging cases, share equipment 
solutions and participant successes  
• Review of up to 3 work orders for each CAPABLE trained OT during office hours  
• Access to Vimeo video clips of visit scenarios  
• Access to other CAPABLE sites' outcomes and experiences through an online 
user group  
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 24 We will monitor the following fidelity components: intervention adherence, intervention 
exposure/dose, quality of delivery, participant engagement, and differentiation between 
critical intervention features.62-64 Adherence consists of the extent to which intervention 
components were delivered as prescribed in the study manuals. Exposure considers the 
number of intervention sessions and the time interventionists spent assisting participants. 
Quality of intervention delivery considers qualitative aspects of the delivery independent 
of the intervention content such as interventionist enthusiasm and global estimates of 
intervention effectiveness. Participant engagement is a measure of participant en thusiasm 
and degree of participation in the intervention. Intervention differentiation will help us 
identify which elements of the intervention are essential and a check to make sure that 
the participants in the intervention only received the plan interven tion.64 To assess these 
varied fidelity domains, we will use a combination of direct assessment (e.g., observation 
via audiotapes) and indirect measures (e.g.,  OT/RN  self-report).62 Similar to prior work, 
we also rely upon a combination of Likert and yes/no items to measure fidelity.65 More 
specifically, the CRC will review the audio recorded intervention sessions and will 
complete the Likert and yes/no items while listening to the recording (no transcripts of the 
recordings will be generated). As a group, we will review the fidelity sc ores generated by 
the CRC review of the audiotapes during our regularly  scheduled  CAPABLE Transitions  
meetings and will use these findings to identify any potential issues that the Study OT and 
RN should address to improve the quality of their administrati on of CAPABLE Transitions . 
Tracking these fidelity metrics longitudinally should provide us with near real -time 
feedback to allow us to improve the delivery of the intervention as we move forward. We 
will use an encrypted voice recorder for this purpose . We will label these audio recordings 
using de -identified numbers only and will store the recordings on secure University of 
Rochester servers and/or the CRC  and PI’s computers. Access to these audio recordings 
will be password protected and audi o recordings  will be destroyed  consistent with federal 
guidelines  and the University of Rochester RSRB Policy 405 .  
For this pilot study, the r esearch staff, interventionists, and participants will not be blinded 
to randomization assignment.  
5.3 Concomitant Interventions  
5.3.1  Allowed Interventions  
With the exception of hospice services and active cancer treatment, participants are 
allowed to receive any medication, treatment, or in -home or outpatient me dical services 
while in the study.  If study participants are briefly hospitalized, we will plan to continue the 
intervention. P rolonged hospitalization would substantially interfere with the delivery of the 
intervention (i.e., 14+ days in first month of in tervention, 21+ following the first month), 
however, and we would discontinue the intervention if prolonged hospitalization were to 
occur.  
5.3.2  Required Interventions  
The only required intervention is that study participants have to be admitted to CHHA 
service s following discharge from a hospital or  post-acute care  facility.  
5.3.3  Prohibited Interventions  
We will exclude older adults who  are receiving hospice services or active cancer 
treatment.  
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 25 5.4 Adherence Assessment  
We will ensure and monitor study adherence and fidelity through several mechanisms. 
First, study interventionists will complete the standardized training offered through The 
Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, which will complement the study’s protocol.  
Second, for the care transitions intervention component, the RN will participate in -person 
training and role-playing  sessions to reinforce the procedures o utlined in the study’s 
training manual.  Third, monthly to bimonthly meetings with the OT, RN, handyworker , 
CRC , and PI will ensure communication, adequate supervision, and appropriate fidelity to 
the intervention. Fourth , we will routinely audio record intervention sessions to monitor 
fidelity and for quality control review. These audio records will be randomly assessed and 
scored by a fidelity checklist that examines session content  (e.g., are the main content 
areas covered?) and  study staff and interventionist competence (e.g., greets patient, 
listens , shows positive regard). Fifth , we will monitor the proportion of study participants 
that complete each portion of the study (e.g., OT intervention, RN intervention, 
handyworker  home repairs and modifications). Lastly, we will routinely monitor whether 
the after/between visit actions (e.g., communication  with handyworker , completion of  
indicated referrals) are performed .

*Both treatment groups receive CHHA CAU services (intervention arm receives CAPABLE Transitions  and CHHA CAU; comparator arm only receives CHHA CAU). CHHA 
CAU services can include nursing, home health aide, medical social work, and occupational, physical, and speech therapy servi ces. CHHA clinicians will determine the types 
and duration of services that CHHA clients in this group receive, which will be completely independent of the research study. The duration of CHHA can  vary dramatically 
across CHHA clients (e.g., range from a single visit to having weekly visits for more than a year).

Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 32 6.2 Description of Evaluations  
6.2.1  Initial  Screening  
The initial  screening will be conducted by the study RN and OT who also function as 
CHHA clinician s. The RN and OT  will regularly screen all of their CHHA intakes to 
identify potential study participants (e.g., discharged from a post-acute  care facility , 
does not have a terminal condition). The RN  and study OT  will ask clients passing the 
initial screen if they are interested in participating in our res earch study. For residents 
indicating an interest to participate in the research study, screening and study 
enrollment must be completed in 28 or fewer days  since  hospital or post-acute care 
facility  discharge  as the timing of the CAPABLE Transitions  is an important aspect of 
the intervention. We will exclude CHHA clients for whom we are unable to screen and 
enroll in the study within this 28-day period. In addition to the URMHC interventionists  
recruiting participants  among their new admissions, we will  contact potentially  eligible 
URMHC clients who have indicated that they are interested in participating in research 
when they complete the new consent process via URMHC. This new  consent process 
is for ALL URMHC patients admitted to URMHC services in which they can "opt in" or 
"opt out"  of being contacted by a UR researcher if there is a study they qualify for.  Only 
participants who have consented to be contacted will be contacted by the CRC.  
Study staff will regularly work with the RN and OT  to review the study inclusion and 
exclusion criteria to consider whether any new admissions scheduled for CHHA 
services may qualify for the study. Unless the  potentially eligible  CHHA client 
expresses interest in participating in the study, CHHA clinician s will not share  
identifiable information with study staff. The RN , OT, and research coordinator  will 
examine the following criteria:  
• admitted to CHHA following a hospital or post-acute care  facility discharge  
• live in the Rochester, NY  region  
• age 65 years and older  
• English -speaking  
• has a terminal diagnosis or receiving active cancer treatment  
• able and willing to participate in a research study  
 
6.2.2  Baseline Assessment, Enrollment, and Randomization Visit  
This evaluation must occur in 28 or fewer  days of hospital or post-acute care facility  
discharge and will make the final determination as to whether the CCHA client is 
eligible for the study.  
Consenting Procedure  
Study staff  will introduce the study and obtain written informed consent from the CHHA 
client (or from a surrogate decision maker if CHHA client is unable to provide informed 
consent but assents to the study). Written informed consent will occur prior to 
conducting t he cognitive test (MMSE), which  will determine if moderate or severe 
cognitive impairment is present.44, 45 Following recommendations86, we will modify the 
MMSE orientation questions to reflect our admin istration in community -dwelling  older 
adults , rather than clinical  or hospital  settings. Study enrollment is stratified by 
cognitive impairment status , and we will prioritize recruitment of people with dementia 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 33 over those without . Additionally, i f moderate or severe cognitive impairment is present, 
study staff will only finalize enrollment of a CHHA client into the study if they are able 
to provide informed consent or provide assent with the presence of a LAR . If a potential 
participant is unable to provide informed consent and does  not have a LAR  available  
for informed consent , study staff will terminate the interview  prior to collecting any 
additional research  information  and compensate the participant $10 for completing the 
screening procedures  
Study participants and Study Partner s will sign two copies of the consent form 
documents. They will keep one signed copy and the study staff will keep the other 
signed copy. For the study staff copies of the consent form, we will  upload the signed 
consent forms and associated documents i nto an electronic database (UR Box) for 
maintenance and long -term storage of the consent forms. We will also retain paper 
copies of the consent documents and all other paper source documents in the study 
files. No st udy documents will be destroyed during the RSRB required period for 
retention of records , though we may additionally scan and upload materials into a 
secure UR Box folder only accessible to study personnel, for backup purposes . Only 
after completing the co nsent process and obtaining written  informed consent,  will 
study staff  commence with the screening process and baseline assessment interview.  
Enrollment  
CHHA clients who satisfy our inclusion and exclusion eligibility criteria will be 
considered enrolled in the study after they (or a surrogate decision -maker) have signed 
the informed consent form.  
Baseline Assessments  
For participants who have been succes sfully screened for eligibility  and are enrolled 
into the study,  baseline assessments are performed against which to measure the 
study ’s intermediate and primary  outcome s as well as to account for pertinent 
covariate data . The baseline assessment will examine the following domains  (see 
Section  6.1 for detailed description of measurements) : 
• Sociodemographics  
• Health and Functioning  
• Mental Health and Cognitive F unctioning  
• Home Environment  
• Medical Services Use (Self-Reported)  
• Study Partner Questions (If Applicable)  
• Chart Extraction  regardless of PCP affiliation  (e.g., Medical Conditions, 
Medications, and Medical Services Use, Communication)  
 
Randomization  
Immediately f ollowing termination of the baseline assessment interview, study staff will 
random ly assign  participants via a stratified random permuted block method .1 
Randomization will be stratified based on cognitive impairment status 
(moderate/severe cognitive impairment present: MMSE score < 20; moderate/severe 
cognitive impairment absent: MMSE > 21).44, 45 ,86 Block randomization will then occur 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 34 within each strata to ensure appropriate  allocation to the treatment and CAU 
groupings. REDCap56 will track  the randomization groupings. The study intervention 
will commence as soon as possible following randomization.  
Compensation  
Of note, in addition to receiving compensation for their time participating in the 
research assessment interviews, p articipant compensation may include additional 
cash payments to cover the expense of home repairs and modifications that are 
recommended  and agreed upon  by our study interventionists and performed by 
Catholic Family Center's HomeWorks contractors  (up to a maximum of $500 per 
participant) . 
6.2.3  Intervention Visits ( <11 total visits)  
The intervention will proceed as outlined in the CAPABLE Transitions’  protocol . In 
addition to delivering the intervention, the study OT and RN will assess the 
engagement of the study participant or dyad with the intervention. The study OT and 
RN also will monitor for the presence of study -related adverse events at each visit.  
6.2.4  Follow-Up and Final Assessment Visit 
Including the baseline assessment visit (on day 0), study staff  will conduct the follow -
up and final assessment visits at approximately 90 days (+/ - 15 days) and 180 days 
(+/- 30 days) , respectively . Of note, many participa nts likely still  will be receiving the 
intervention at the 90 day assessment. At the 180 day assessment, however, no 
participants will be receiving the intervention. These assessment visits will examine 
the same domains that the baseline assessment examine s, but also will include 
questions to obtain informat ion on intervention feedback . The follow -up assessments 
will examine the following domains : 
• Socio demographics  
• Health and Functioning  
• Mental Health and Cognitive F unctioning  
• Home Environment  
• Medical Services Use (Self-Reported)  
• Study Partner Questions (If Applicable)  
• Chart Extraction  regardless of PCP affiliation  (e.g., Medical Conditions, 
Medications, and Medical Services Use, Communication)  
• Study Fidelity  
• Intervention Feedback  (intervention arm only)  
The CRC or research assistant also will perform the determination of capacity for 
informed consent at these 3 - and 6-month intervals to screen for whether participants 
who initially demonstrated capacity for informed consent may have lost the ability to 
provide informed consent. If they are unable to demonstrate capacity for informed 
consent, we will go through the e ntire consent process again, and those unable to 
demonstrate informed consent only will be able to continue with study participation if 
they have a legally authorized representative ( LAR; see Section 7.3.1 for definition of 
LAR) who also will need to demonstrate capacity to provide informed consent prior to 
signing the informed consent document. If the older adult is unable to provide informed 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 35 consent and does not have a LAR able to provide  informed consent, they will not be 
able to continue with the study and the in -person assessments and interventions 
sessions will cease.  
Additionally, for participants who discontinue the study intervention, unless the 
participants refuse to participate in  the study assessments, the CRC  or research 
assistant will continue to conduct assessments per the assessment schedule.  
Assessment for adverse events will terminate when in -home assessment visits are 
concluded  at approximately 180 days following  hospital or  post-acute care facility  
discharge, which also marks the period for when participation in the study terminates. 
Of note, this last assessment visit will occur after the OT and RN intervention sessions 
have been completed (for many participants , the last assessment visit will occur 
approximately 2 months following the termination of the intervention) . Possible 
reasons for early termination of the study intervention include participants are no 
longer willing to participate in the intervention or that participants have moved, 
transitioned to a nursing home for long -term care, or died (see Section 8 below for a 
detailed list of intervent ion discontinuation procedures).  
7 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
7.1 Risk Category/Potential Risk  
Minimal risks to study participants are expected . For the assessment interviews, the 
primary risk is invasion of privacy, breach of confidentiality (if safety issues such as elder 
abuse are detected), or mild reactions of distress or fatigue. Given that assessments are 
conducted in the participant ’s homes, others could be present, which risks revealing the 
participant’s involvement in the study. Participants will have full discretion in having others 
present. Assessment measures and procedures have been safely used in pr evious 
research with older adults; no sustained negative effects from assessments are expected, 
but negative outcomes cannot be ruled out.  
Similarly, with regard to the intervention sessions, some participants may experience 
some discomfort, or fatigue in having study staff in their homes for the intervention 
sessions. Additionally, as the intervention sessions may include exercises to enhance 
function and reduce the risk of falls, some patients may be physically fatigued at the end 
of these sessions  (in pa rticular, the OT sessions can include physical activities such as 
simplifying tasks and the environment, using assistive devices, and balance  and fall 
recovery techniques to decrease fear of falling ). The original CAPABLE  was well received 
and tolerate d by  older adult participants, however, who uniformly reported that the 
intervention benefited them.81, 82 Additionally, as CAPABLE Transitions  likewise aims to 
improve home safety by reducing the presence of environmental hazards (ho me hazards 
is an intermediate outcome), we expect that those participating in our intervention will be 
at less risk of experiencing adverse events such as falls.  
If a participant’s cognition declines such that she is unable to work towards her study 
goals , our interventionists will work with the participant to identify new goals to work on. If 
the capability of a participant changes (for worse or better) such that there are no further 
identified feasible goals to work on, we will end the intervention. Our intervention is 
multifaceted (e.g., handyworker, OT, and RN), meaning that  only those components for 
which there are no clear objectives or workable goals  may terminate.  This also could occur 
if a participant achieves their goals quickly, thereby only r equiring a few of the 
interventionist sessions rather than all of the possible sessions . 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 36 We will train both the study interviewers and interventionists to handle these minimal 
discomforts if they occur  (e.g., if a participant is becoming fatigued, can chan ge activities 
or terminate the session)  and will conduct assessments regarding intervention safety at 
every in -home visit. During these assessments, study staff will regularly query for the 
occurrence of adverse events. Although we do not anticipate there to be any serious 
adverse events related to our intervention, staff will systematically monitor for these events 
during the intervention and follow -up periods and report them  should they occur  
(consistent with RSRB policy 801, “Reporting Research Events”) . 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
At each intervention session , study staff will inquire about the occurrence of  adverse 
events and significant adverse events  since the last visit  (timing of  intervention  sessions  
shown in Table 2). This schedule of assessments is such that, as the intensity of the 
intervention is the greatest, so will we monitor for the occurrence of adverse events  most 
intensely, which will help us identify the presence of any study -related adver se events.  
7.3 Protection Against Risks  
This section provides information on how risks to participants in the study will be mediated 
and specifies events that would preclude a participant from continuing with the 
intervention. This section also includes the i nformed consent procedures and measures 
to protect participants against risk during the study.  
7.3.1   Informed Consent Process  
This section explains the informed consent process and how it is used to protect 
participants.  
• The consent process informs a volunteer about the study, indicates the 
participation is voluntary , and states that the volunteer  has the right to stop at any 
time. Risks are delineated  in the informed consent form and described orally during 
the consent  process.  
• Individuals will provid e written informed consent prior to  the start of the in-person 
screening activities or the baseline interview. Consent forms only will be used if 
they have a current IRB approval stamp. The informed consent process will be 
conducted in a manner to facilita te questions from potential study subjects. If a 
study team member is unable to answer a question, an investigator will be 
contacted. All questions from potential subjects  will be answered prior to  obtaining 
a signature. The PI, a Co-I, or an IRB -approved consent designee must be present 
when a subject signs the informed consent form. That member of the study team 
must sign the informed consent form at the same time and in the presence of the 
subject . The consent form must be signed and dated by the subject  and the 
consent designee. No subjects will be involved in research activities unless an 
investigator or a designated study staff has obtained documentation of legally 
effective informed consent of the subject. The collection of protected health 
informatio n and questionnaires are considered to be research activities requiring 
prior documentation of informed  consent.  
• The study RN will regularly screen all of her CHHA intakes to identify potential 
study participants (e.g., discharged from a post-acute care fa cility, does not have 
a terminal condition). The study RN  will ask clients passing the initial screen if they 
are interested in participating in our research study. For residents indicating an 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 37 interest to participate in the research study  and agree to have  a study staff 
member visit them to provide more information , the study RN and CRC will work 
together to schedule an in -person screening visit that is convenient to the potential 
participant. Consent only will be sought under circumstances that provide the  
prospective subject sufficient opportunity to consider whether to participate and 
that minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The information that 
is given to the subject or representative shall be in language understandable to 
the subje ct. Potential study subjects will be given ample time to read and consider 
the consent form. All subjects will be reminded of the voluntary nature of study 
participation. Using the consent form to structure discussion, research personnel 
will explain the s tudy, its potential benefits and risks, and alternatives, and 
document the consent process by signature of the subject and the person 
obtaining  consent. During informed consent procedures, individuals will be told 
about possible risks and benefits of participation. This will include information that 
questions asked may cause them to feel uncomfortable or upset. Subjects will be 
informed that they may withdraw from an assessment at any time for any reason 
and receive full reimbursement for that assessme nt, and that they may withdraw 
from the research study at any time without negative consequences. Subjects are 
further informed that research staff will perform an immediate evaluation of their 
safety should safety concerns arise during assessments or inte rvention sessions. 
For non -acute medical or psychological concerns research staff identify, we will 
recommend that subjects follow -up with their primary care physicians. Research 
staff will assess the subject’s capacity with an RSR B-approved Determination of 
Consent Capacity F orm that has been successfully implemented in other studies 
of older adults and consists of open -ended questions that will address the potential 
subject’s knowledge and understanding of the study’s objectives, general 
procedures, volun tary nature of participation (ability to withdraw), and possible 
risks and benefits of participation. For individuals who have difficulty in one or 
more of these areas, further review of the relevant elements of the study will be 
provided in order to impro ve their knowledge and understanding to a level that 
enables them to make a meaningful choice about participation. Those who 
demonstrate adequate capacity to consent will be invited to sign the informed 
consent form to enroll as a research subject. The con sent will be an ongoing 
process during the study. Explanations of the study and verbal consent will be 
conducted at each data collection. Subjects will be reminded that their participation 
is voluntary and that they can withdraw at any time for any  reasons . 
• For potential subjects who lack the capacity to provide informed consent, study 
staff will only proceed with the research study if the potential subject  assents to 
the study and a legally authorized representative (LAR)  is willing to: 1) enroll 
the parti cipant in the research study , 2) demonstrates capacity for consent,  and 3) 
signs the consent form. A LAR is an individual authorized to consent on behalf of 
a prospective research participant. Of note, failure to object is not assent and 
resistance to a re search procedure in a non -verbal subject is an indication of 
dissent for that procedure. Federal regulations (45 CFR 46.116 and 21 CFR 50.20) 
defer to state law for persons authorized to provide such consent. Consistent with 
RSRB policy and congruent with New York State Public Health Law, Article 29 -C 
and Article 29 -CC (Family Health Care Decision Act), t he persons  listed  below  in 
order of authority, may act as a LAR to give consent to research participation for 
persons with decisional  impairment . If a pers on listed is not reasonably available, 
or is unwilling or  incompetent to make a decision regarding research participation 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 38 on behalf of the subject, the authority falls to the person of next highest priority.  
1. A health care agent properly designated on a hea lth care proxy form;  
2. A court -appointed guardian under the New York Mental Hygiene Law Article 
81; 
3. A research proxy (individual designated by the research subject, while 
retaining the decisional capacity to do so), to make decisions for her/him 
regarding pa rticipation in research;  
4. A family member or friend (in the priority listed below) pursuant to the New 
York State Family Health Care Decisions Act (Public Health Law Article 29 -
CC): 
a. A spouse or domestic partner;  
b. An adult son or daughter;  
c. A parent;  
d. An adul t brother or sister; or  
e. A close friend, who is an adult (18 years or older) and has a close 
personal relationship with the subject, provided that the individual 1) 
provides a signed written statement , in a format approved by the 
RSRB, to the PI that he/she is a close friend of the subject, 2) that 
he/she has maintained such regular contact with the patient as to be 
familiar with the patient’s activities, health, religious or moral beliefs, 
and 3) stating the facts and circumstances that demonstrate su ch 
familiarity . 
7.3.2  Protection Against Risks  
This section describes measures to protect participants against study specific risks, as 
well as plans for notifying participants of trial results during and after the conclusion of the 
trial and providing the participants’ health providers with the appropriate information from 
the trial, as needed, concerning individual participants. Study procedures, both 
assessments and interventions, pose mini mal risk to participants. Below  we describe 
potential risks and st udy procedures to protect against these risks.  
The PI (Dr. Simning) will be responsible for prompt reporting of new information and other 
study -related safety information such as study -related or unexpected adverse events and 
protocol deviations that invol ve a safety issue to the RSRB, sponsor, federal agencies, 
and other required entities. Expected, non -study -related adverse events also will be 
tracked and reported on in the RSRB continuing reviews. The study will be modified to 
address safety issues or ev en put on hold if necessary. The PI will review the data 
periodically to identify any problems and potential risks.  
• In order to protect the confidentiality of subject information , we will take a 
number of precautions. These include training research interv iewers in 
confidentiality procedures; entry and storage of data using coded identification 
labels; maintenance of project computers in secure locations with restricted 
access by enforced password protection; and use of Health Insurance Portability 
and Acco untability Act (HIPAA ) compliant data management software ( e.g., 
REDCap, Box ). Back -ups of study files will be made daily to allow for recovery of 
data due to disk failure. All data, including assessment measures, will be obtained 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 39 with the written consent of the patient. Information pertaining to individual 
participants will be released with the patient's informed and written consent only, 
except in unusual cases where withholding the information might pose a serious 
risk or danger to the participant or oth ers. All data will be identified by a uniquely 
coded study number assigned to each participant. Access to the master list of 
study numbers will be restricted to the PI and CRC . Confidentiality will be further 
maintained by the storage of "hard copy" data i n locked files in a locked office. 
Access to computerized data is restricted and subject to review by the PI. 
Publications or presentations will report only cumulative data or descriptions 
certain to maintain participants' anonymity. All data collection in volving human 
subjects will be HIPAA compliant. All data involving human subjects will be 
stripped of any identifiers; the data w ill be stored in secure program s called 
REDCAP  and Box , which manage protected health information in a HIPAA 
compliant manner. Audio recordings will occur on encrypted devices, will be 
password protected, and will be destroyed in accordance with local and federal 
guidelines to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable  information.  
• In order to protect subjects’ priva cy, audio recordings of intervention session only 
will be made with subjects’ written consent; subjects will be free to refuse to 
answer any questions they would prefer to not answer; and interviews will be 
conducted in private  settings.  
• Risks associated with emotional distress or fatigue will be minimized by 
employment of research personnel and interventionists with appropriate 
backgrounds and work experience with older adult subjects. The baseline 
research interview will last approximate ly two hours in total. Given the length of 
time involved for this assessment, and concerns regarding subject health and well -
being, subjects will be reminded that if they become fatigued, they may terminate 
the interview at any time, and that the interview  can be conducted over multiple 
sessions as needed. Research personnel will be trained to recognize potential 
signs of fatigue among older adult  subjects, and to actively suggest alternative 
data collection strategies (e.g., telephone -based and mail -in int erviews), in order 
to reduce the possibility of overwhelming study subjects and to ensure 
completeness of data collection. These strategies have been employed effectively 
in the PI’s past research involving older adult  populations.  
o During the course of ass essment interviews, research staff will monitor 
subjects' reactions for signs of distress or fatigue. If necessary, subjects may 
take breaks from the interview, or complete the interview over several sessions 
if fatigue becomes a  concern.  
o If a subject’s le vel of emotional distress becomes a concern, the research staff 
member will evaluate the subject's emotional state and safety and will briefly 
attempt to de -escalate the patient's distress. If these measures do not 
effectively reduce the subject’s distress  within 10 -15 minutes and, depending 
on the severity of the subject’s distress, research staff will call Dr. Simning (or 
the person covering for him), who will maintain a cell phone for this purpose.  
o The study subjects will consist  of a population of funct ionally impaired older 
adults with a recent acute medical illness. Research staff therefore will be 
trained in the study’s safety protocols for managing acute medical events (e.g., 
chest pain, loss of consciousness), suicide risk, and elder abuse. Subjects  will 
be informed that study staff will perform an immediate evaluation of their safety 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 40 should concerns arise during assessments or treatment sessions. Subjects 
also will be informed that their confidentiality may be breached should 
concerns arise about th eir safety (e.g., if emergency medical services are 
needed). Finally, they will be informed that suspected child abuse will be 
reported, as mandated by law , as well suspected elder abuse . Any subject 
who endorses death or suicidal ideation will be asked ad ditional questions to 
assess her/his safety. Any endorsements of active suicidal ideation will involve 
notifying Dr. Simning for review of risk and protective factors and consideration 
of emergency psychiatric services. Dr. Simning is a board -certified ger iatric 
psychiatrist with expertise in suicide evaluation and management and 
regularly provides clinical care to older adults who are distressed and at risk 
for suicide. While it is expected (based on prior research) that only a small 
minority of subjects f or the current study will report significant distress (and 
even fewer suicide ideation or elder abuse), research staff will be trained in 
the study’s safety protocol and data from each assessment will be reviewed 
with Dr. Simning weekly, or more often if n eeded. A small minority of 
participants may experience elder abuse. In the case of suspected elder 
abuse, subjects will be given an immediate referral to  appropriate community -
based resources (e.g., Adult Protective Services,  the Elder Abuse Prevention 
Program of Rochester ), which provide crisis intervention services, and the 
primary care provider will be contacted via a letter and/or a phone call. Any 
suspected cases of elder abuse will be immediately reviewed with the PI 
before research staff sends the as sessment. Situations involving potential 
imminent safety concerns may involve the use of emergency services and law 
enforcement authorities. A similar safety protocol has been used successfully 
in Dr. Simning’s prior studies as well as other University of Rochester studies 
involving older adults.  
o The study PI (Dr. Simning) will provide weekly (and as needed) supervision to 
research staff. In addition, Dr. Simning is a licensed geriatric psychiatrist and 
is experienced in working with older adults, including  those experiencing 
emotional distress and will available as  needed.  
o To ensure appropriate safety precautions when conducting in -person study 
procedures, the process for conducting in -person visits outlined in the Guidance 
for Human Subject Research will b e followed  to mitigate risk for COVID -19. 
When/if a participant or a caregiver develops COVID or there is a suspicion of 
COVID, we will reschedule/postpone visits accordingly.  
8 INTERVENTION AND STUDY  DISCONTINUATION  
There are several ways this intervention and/or study can terminate for study participants:  
1) Intervention discontinuation by the study participant: Study participants may withdraw 
voluntarily from participation in the study at any time and for any reason. If the participant 
withdraws from participating in the intervention, with th e permission of the participant, we 
will continue with the follo w-up assessment interviews (at three  and six months) to monitor 
their response to the intervention via intention -to-treat principle s and to help capture study -
related AE and SAEs. If a partici pant were to experience an AE, we also would ask their 
permission to follow them until the AE has resolved (even if this extends past the study 
period).  Of note, there are two subgroups within this category. The first subgroup consists 
of those who are sat isfied with the intervention (e.g., perceive that they have benefited 
from the intervention), but no longer want to receive it (e.g., they want a smaller “dose” of 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 41 the intervention). The second subgroup consists of those who elect to discontinue to the 
intervention because they are not satisfied with the intervention (e.g., do not perceive that 
they have benefited from the intervention), and therefore no longer want to receive it.  
2) Study withdrawal by the study participant: Study participants may withdraw  voluntarily 
from participation in the study at any time and for any reason. This category will be for 
participants who decide to withdraw participation from any additional study activities 
including the intervention and study assessment s. 
3) Intervention discontinuation by the study team: We will discontinue the intervention in 
the situations  outlined below. Of note, if the participant is agreeable and able, we will 
continue to conduct the study assessments after the intervention is discontinued.   
• Death (many of the participants will have severe, chronic medical comorbidities 
and we anticipate that some may die during the course of the study)  
• Changing residences (including transitioning to nursing home long -term care)  
• Prolonged hospitalization that substa ntially interferes with the delivery of the 
intervention (i.e., 14+ days in first month of intervention, 21+ days following the 
first month)  
We will not replace participants who withdraw from the study.  
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
9.1 General Design Issues  
This study is a randomized, CAU -comparator, unblinded, 60-subject clinical trial of an OT-
led in -home intervention designed to help older adults successfully transition to their 
homes following a hospital or post-acute care  facility discharge.  This research p roject is 
designed to be an iterative pilot study whose primary objective is to examine the feasibility 
of the CAPABLE Transitions  intervention and the assessment of the study’s intermediate 
and primary outcomes. Guided by research staff experiences, feedb ack from the study 
interventionists and participants , and our treatment fidelity data , we will continually seek 
to enhance and optimize the study protocol and procedures to improve recruitment . Such 
modifications could include adjustments to the interventi on schedule or content or updates 
to our recruitment and retention process.  
Given the focus on feasibility rather than hypothesis testing, this study is not blinded. This 
lack of blinding will enable the study CRC , research assistant, and/or PI to work closely 
with the study interventionists and treatment group participants to ide ntify ways to enhance 
the study and its procedures.  
Our analyses will largely consist of univariate statistics to examine the proportions and 
means and variance of the primary and secondary outcomes  listed below  and in Table 3. 
Primary outcomes:  
• screening, enrollment, and retention of study participants  
• fidelity to and perceived benefit  of the intervention  
• data completeness with regard to our intermediate and primary outcomes  
Secondary outcomes (at three and six months  following hospital or  post-acute care facility 
discharge ): 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 42 • home time  
• quality of life  
• health care utilization  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
The total sample size of 60 is consistent with a prior pilot study of the original CAPABLE  
intervention, which had 40 participants.81 This sample size is not powered to test 
hypotheses or to compare differences across the care -as-usual and treatment groups.  
9.2.1  Treatment Assignm ent Procedures  
Study staff will random ly assign participants via a stratified random permuted block 
method .1 Randomization will be stratified based on cognitive impairment status 
(moderate/severe cognitive impairment present: MMSE score < 20; moderate/severe 
cognitive impairment absent: MMSE > 21).44, 45 ,86 We will conduct block randomization to 
ensure that there is appropriate allocation to the treatment and CAU groups across 
moderate/severe cognitive impairment strata. REDCap56 will track  the randomization 
groupings. In total, 60 participants will enroll in this study . We will prioritize the recruitment 
of people with dementia over those without , but aim to increase our recruitment of non -
cognitively impaired patients as well . Because  the goal of this pilot study is to focus on 
feasibility , the bias that may be introduced by having unblinded research staff is of minimal 
concern at this stage.  
9.3 Interim analyses  and Stoppin g Rules  
As the primary objective is to examine CAPABLE Transitions’  feasibility rather than clinical 
effect, we are not planning to conduct interim analyses with associated stopping rules . 
9.4 Outcomes  
9.4.1  Primary O utcomes  
The primary study outcomes consist of the feasibility measures  listed below.  
1) Screening, enrollment, and retention of study participants: We will conduct 
univariate analyses to evaluate how many CHHA participants we screened, how 
many enrolled, and how many successfully finished the study.  
2) Fidelity to and perceived benefit  of the intervention  (at three and six months) :  
a. To assess fidelity to the intervention, s tudy staff will examine audio 
recordings of the intervention sessions and in -between session procedures 
(e.g., handyworker  work order completed) and score whether the OT/RN 
completed the critical components associated with the intervention 
session. We will  score completion of the critical components as “yes” or 
“no” and will then conduct univariate analyses to examine OT/RN 
adherence to the study protocol for the intervention sessions.   
b. To evaluate perceived benefit  of the intervention, study staff will con duct 
interviews a t three and six months to obtain survey responses to Likert item 
scales on CAPABLE Transitions  perceived benefit and burdensomeness 
to study participants. We will analyze these Likert item responses with 
univariate statistics. For narrative feedback, we will examine individual 
participant quotes and reported concerns for which we will not conduct 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 43 statistical analyses.  
3) Data completeness with regard to our primary and intermediate outcomes at three 
and six months: We will use univariate statistics to examine the proportion of the 
CAU and intervention group participants who have information on our prim ary (i.e., 
home time, quality of life, health care utilization ) and intermediate (e.g. , timing and 
frequency of medical appointments, frequency of communication with medical 
providers , medication adherence, anxiety and depressive symptoms, physical 
functio ning, home hazards, fear of falling, mobility, self -efficacy, pain) outcomes.  
9.4.2  Secondary O utcomes  
This study’s secondary objectives are to obtain preliminary data on home time, quality of 
life, and health care utilization  at three and six months following hospital or post-acute 
care facility  discharge . Univariate analyses will provide the means and standard deviations 
for these outcomes.  
9.5 Data Analyses  
Data analyses will consist of univariate analytic approaches. For this pilot study, we have 
no pl ans to perform across groups comparisons or to test hypotheses.  Although our 
sample size is too small to facilitate across group comparisons or hypotheses testing, the 
24 CHHA CAU participants will provide  precision and variance estimates  for our primary 
clinical outcomes among the comparator group, which subsequently will be used to  inform 
sample size calculations for the large -scale clinical trial to follow.83 
10 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Study staff (e.g., CRC , research assistant ) will collect and obtain study data directly from 
the participants (via in -person interviews) as well as from the participant’s medical records. 
The collection, transfer and storage of data will be conducted in compliance with HIPAA 
and structured to minimize risk of protected health informa tion disclosure. All records 
related to a participant’s research will be stored in locked filing cabinets or on computers 
protected with passwords. Furthermore, s tudy staff will record data directly into  data 
collection forms that are present in  REDCap  and all web -based information transmission 
is encrypted . We also will rely on UR Box to store electronic information, which is HIPAA 
compliant. The database servers are housed in secure institutional data center facilities at 
University of Rochester . Addition ally, audio recordings of  intervention  sessions will  monitor 
fidelity and assist with  quality control review. These audio recordings will be labeled using 
de-identified numbers only and will be stored  on secure University of Rochester servers 
and/or the CRC  and PI’s computers. We will also use an encrypted voice recorder to 
protect participants’ protected health information.  Access to these audio recordings will be 
password protected and audi o recordin gs will be in accordance with local and federal 
guidelines . The protocol include s a list of the study survey measures (Table 3) . During the 
RN and OT intervention sessions, the RN and OT may decide to skip certain 
questions/items to focus on issues that are most relevant to each participant.  
Consequently,  study interventionist s can, at their discretion, skip or not complete 
questions  in these assessments  that they feel are less relevant to the participants they are 
working with  for the study intervention visits . For fields/questions we believe are critical to 
the study, we will make sure that they require a response in REDCap  and cannot be 
skipped , such as Adverse Event assessment s. 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 44 10.2 Quality Assurance  
10.3.1  Training  
To ensure appropriate human research knowledge, all study personnel with access to 
subject research data will have completed mandatory training in the protection of 
human research participants per guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Health 
and Huma n Services, Office for Human Research Protections 
(https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/) and per guidelines of University of Rochester Medical 
Center ( URMC ). Any additional personnel will complete this training before having 
access to the study databases. Consistent with University of Rochester Medical 
Center RSRB policy, all investigators and research staff will complete certification by 
the RSRB, which requires completion of a course that contains topics such as “History 
and Ethical Principles,” “Privacy and Confide ntiality,” “Informed Consent, ” and “The 
Federal Regulations.”  This course provides a substantial resource to the investigators 
for understanding the ethics and regulations governing research with human subjects. 
Research staff also will be trained to asses s, de -escalate, and activate appropriate 
levels of care for those experiencing emotional distress  
10.3.2  Quality Control Committee  
Not applicable.  
10.3.3  Metrics  
Audiotaping of intervention sessions will be routinely conducted for fidelity and quality 
control review. OT/RN adherence to the intervention also will be quantified. 
Additionally,  the PI and CRC  will regularly monitor the database to ensure that data 
are appropriately recorded and complete.   
10.3.4  Protocol Deviations  
Study staff must  not deviate from the protocol, except to protect the life and physical 
well-being of a participant in an emergency. All deviations from the protocol, with the 
reason for the deviati on and the date of occurrence, will be documented using the 
Protocol Deviation Tracking Log F orm . Protocol deviations will be reviewed and 
evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate corrective and 
preventive actions will be instituted.  
10.3.5  Monitoring  
The principal investigator will be responsible for monitoring the study. Ro utine 
monitor ing will occur to verify that:  
• participant enrollment is being achieved  
• the inclusion/exclusion criteria has been met at enrollment  
• the correct version of the informed consent has been signed by the subject  
• AEs and SAEs  have been  captured and properly repo rted 
• verify that the data are accurate and complete  
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 45 11 PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review  
The Universit y of Rochester Medical Center’s RSRB  will review and approve this study’s  
protocol and its informed consent document and any subsequent modifications.  
11.2 Informed Consent Forms  
We will obtain signed consent form s from each  participant. As many of our participants 
may have cognitive impairment that could affect their ability to provide informed con sent, 
we will systematically evaluate their capacity for informed consent. To do so, the CRC  or 
research assistant will read the consent form to participants, who will be encouraged to 
ask questions throughout the process. To determine capacity for informed consent, at the 
conclusion of the consent process and prior to signing the consent form, st udy staff will 
ask all participants the following questions:  
• Could you please tell me what this study is about?  
• What are the potential risks to you of participating in this study?  
• What are the benefits for participating in this study?  
• Do you understand t hat your participation in this study is voluntary and that you 
may stop at any time or not answer any questions that you feel uncomfortable 
answering?  
• Do you have any questions about the interview?  
If in answering these questions the participant is unabl e to demonstrate an understanding 
or appreciation of the issues, research staff and the participant will further review the 
consent form and repeat the pertinent questions. Participants who achieve a 
demonstrated understanding of the study will be determin ed to have capacity to provide 
informed consent. For those who do not, research staff will attempt to identify a  legally 
authorized representative  (LAR; see  Section 7.3. 1 for definitio n of LAR) who also will need 
to demonstrate capacity to provide informed  consent prior to signing the informed consent 
document. If the older adult is unable to provide informed consent and does not have a 
LAR able to provide informed consent, we will thank them for their time  with $10 for 
completing the screening and procedur es and inform them that they are not eligible for the 
study. Participants’ answers are tracked on a Determination of Consent Capacity Form 
that is kept with the research record as documentation of the consent process . For 
participants/LARs unable to provide informed consent , however, we will document the 
reason for study ineligibility on the  Determination of Consent Capacity Forms . On these 
forms , we will not  include any personal identifiers, but rather will use a screening ID 
number to track  completi on of these forms for participants and, if applicable, LARs. For 
participants and LARs unable to provide informed consent and who are not enrolled in the 
study, the  screening ID number will not be linked to any personal identifiers. For enrolled 
participan ts who thereby demonstrate and provide informed consent or who have an LAR 
that provides  informed  consent, however, we will link these screening ID numbers with an 
assigned  study -specific ID number  that can be linked  to identifiers we are collecting for 
the study . We will not keep any identi fiable information  for older adults /LARs who do not 
or are unable to sign consent to participate in our study . Rather, w e will only keep basic 
demographic information such as age, sex, and race and ethnicity to allow us to track 
those who do and do not participate in our study; those older than 89 will be grouped in a 
90+ age category .  
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 46 11.3 Participant Confidentiality  
All participant data, including assessment measures, will be obtained with the written 
consent of the partici pant or surrogate decision -maker. All data collection will be HIPAA 
compliant, and a uniquely coded study number assigned to each participant will identify 
participant data  (i.e., a participant ID number) . To protect the confidentiality of participant 
information, we will take a number of precautions:  
• use research personnel trained in confidentiality procedures  
• enter and store data on highly secure servers  
• maintain project computers in secure locations (e.g., locked offices)  
• restrict access to study data to study personnel on a needed to know basis that 
is enforced with password protection  
• minimal reliance on paper documents  
• publications or presentations will report only cumulative data or descriptions 
certain to maintain participants'  anonymity  
In particular, we will rely on URMC’s REDCap servers housed in a local data center at the 
University of Rochester (all web -based information transmission is encrypted). REDCap 
was developed in a manner consistent with HIPAA security requirements  and is 
recommended to University of Rochester researchers by the URMC Research Privacy 
Officer and Office for Human Subject Protection. Access to computerized data is restricted 
and subject to review by the PI. In accordance with local and federal guideli nes, we will 
keep study data for a minimum of three years following submissions of the final reports to 
NIA. 
Furthermore, i nformation pertaining to individual participants will be released with the 
participant’s informed and written consent only, except in  unusual cases where 
withholding the information might pose a serious risk or danger to the participant or others . 
If necessary, information also may be released without written permission of the 
participant for monitoring by the RSRB, NIA, OHRP, or other governmental agency .  
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by  the RSRB, the NIA, the Office for Human 
Research Protections , or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that 
research participants are protected.  
12 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This research study will be conducted only after receiving approval from University of 
Rochester Medical Center’s Research Su bjects Review Board. Human research at 
University of Rochester is grounded in foundational ethical principles. These guiding 
ethical principles are embodied in the Nuremberg Code of 1947, the Declaration of 
Helsinki of 1964 and its subsequent revisions (Wo rld Medical Association), and particularly 
in the Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human 
Subjects of Research issued by the National Commission for the Protection of Human 
Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Researc h in 1979. The Belmont Report principles 
of respect for persons, beneficence and justice are accepted as critical for the ethical 
conduct of human subject research . Additionally, this study will adhere to the principles of 
NIH’s Good Clinical Practice desi gned to help assure the safety, integrity, and quality of 
 
Version 2.5– November  2022 , pg. 47 clinical trials and address elements related to the design, conduct, and reporting of clinical 
trials.  
13 COMMITTEES  
Given that CAPABLE Transitions  is a minimal risk study, a data and safety monitoring  
board is not warranted. Instead, this study will have a research mentorship committee that 
will provide broad oversight of the study. This committee will include mentors on the K23 
award and will have broad oversight on all aspects of the study and will p rovide expert 
feedback as needed should the study experience difficulties in its operationalization and 
implementation.  
14 PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  
Although this pilot study is neither designed nor powered to test a hypothesis, we 
nonetheless plan to publish and/or present  on the interven tion’s protocol, development, 
and preliminary findings.

 PIONEER -01 STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Sponsor:  Seno Medical Instruments , Inc. 
 
Study Title : A Pivotal Study of Imaging with Opto-acoustics to diagnose breast masses 
detected by mammography and/or clinical findings : A NEw Evaluation Tool 
for Radiologists  
 
Study Phase  Pivotal, Non -Significant Risk  Study   
 Name of Finished  
 Medical Device  
(Investigational Device):   Imagio , is an opto-acoustic (OA) imaging system designed to concurrently 
collect images in conjunction with diagnostic ultrasound (co -registered OA 
and B-mode imaging) . 
  
Indications for Use:  Imagio  is indicated for use for opto-acoustic (OA) evaluation of breasts in 
women who are referred for a diagnostic breast ultrasound work -up due to 
a suspicious mass (including both palpable and non -palpable) or an imaging 
finding such as architectural distortion, asymmetry, or suspicious calcifications .  
  This device is not intended to be used as a replacement for mammographic screening or for definitive pathologic diagnosis.  
 
Study Objectives  
 and Endpoints :  The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Imagio  for the vis ualization of suspicious masses when compared to the 
Imagio  ultrasound  component .  The following outcomes  will be evaluated to 
determine whether I magio : 
 
1. Has superior specificity (primary) relative to  Imagio ultrasound  (IUS) 
with non -inferior sensitivity (secondary)  relative to I US.  
2. Has clinically acceptable predictive value of a positive test (PPV) and of 
a negative test (NPV) for a range of possible  breast cancer prevalence . 
3. Downgrades benign masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b relative to 
IUS. 
4. Downgrades  masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b according to the 
site investigator.  
5. Upgrades malignant  masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b relative to 
IUS. 
6. Achieves  a high degree of concordance with the biopsy outcome . 
7. Is safe.

Study Design:    This is a prospective, controlled, multi -center , observational study that will 
compare Imagio OA versus the ultrasound component  (IUS) for the 
visualization of suspicious masses .   
 
Pilot/Pivotal Study:                     The Pilot Study (Pilot Phase of the Pivotal Study) data will be used to 
validate the existing algorithm to a pre -determined diagnostic rule set 
based on OA image characteristics established in a previously conducted 
independent Feasibility Study. The Pilot  Study will collect imaging data 
from 100 subjects passing Quality Assurance review conducted by three 
central radiologists  blinded to clinical history and histopathology outcome .  
Then a pool of at least 20 other independent radiologists  (readers)  not 
affiliated with any sites will be prospectively trained and then tested for 
proficiency using the image sets constructed by the central radiologists using the last 70 of  the 100 Pilot cases .  The first 30 cases will be used to 
familiarize  readers with the image sets, the viewing logistics, and the eCRF 
to be completed , prior to reader proficiency testing .  Upon establishing 
and meeting prospective rules for proficiency (based on Imagio sensitivity  
[missing at most one cancer]  and Imagio sp ecificity >30%  after excluding 
the first 30 cases to allow for learning ), a subset of  7 proficient readers will 
be selected for  purposes of   read ing IUS and Imagio  OA and 3 other 
readers will be selected to share the  reimbursement reads  of multiple 
combina tions of imaging modalities with or without Imagio,    The 
registration readers will be selected  at random based on availability and 
once all readers are tested for proficiency;  reimbursement readers will be 
selected by the Seno Medical Director.  All registration readers will be 
proficiency tested and selected prior to making any Pivotal Study i.e., reads 
for subjects 101  and beyond , which will constitute the Pivotal Study .  All 
effectiveness analyses will be conducted at the mass -level ; it is projecte d 
that no more than 5% of all subjects will have multiple masses.  A 
minimum of  100 Pilot Study masses  and at least  1,700 Pivotal Study 
masses  pass ing QA review and  excluding enrollment failures  are to be 
included.  Enrollment will continue until there are 100 Pilot Study masses  
and at least 1, 700 Pivotal Study masses  that pass both criteria.  The 100 
Pilot Study cases will be used for education, training, and publication purposes; o nly the Pivotal Study cases will be used to support Imagio  
registration  for this indication for use.  All selected registration readers will 
evaluate all masses  according to a MRMC design.  To mimic  the real world 
setting as closely as possible, all readers will receive feedback on the histo pathology results in read only mode following their case  reads  after 
completing their locked evaluations; readers may not change results after 
receiving feedback.  For the Pivotal Study, subsets of 5% of registration image sets and 2.5% of all reimbursement image sets will be reread to 
assess learning and consistency ; the first reads will be used in the data 
analyses for registration and reimbursement .  The PMA filing will be based

(co-registered B -mode imaging)  ultrasound.  Use  of color or power 
Doppler using a single  linear conventional ultrasound probe will be 
separately assessed for research purposes and the Doppler information 
will not be used in the analysis of this study for determining the safety 
and effectiveness of Imagio.   
 
Control:    The subject  will serve as her own control for the study.  Imagio  OA 
evaluation results will be compared with the Imagio ultraso und 
component (IUS) for the registration read and Imagio will also be 
assessed  in combination with Mammography and conventional 
diagnostic ultrasound (CDU) image  sets for the reimbursement reads .  
The ultrasound component of Imagio, designated IUS, will serve as 
the “internal control .”  If a biopsy is performed, then the histology 
will serve as the gold standard; if a biopsy is not performed at study 
entry or for 12 months following study entry with no change in the 
target mass according to CDU  (if perfo rmed ), then the subject is 
considered to be a True -Negative for analysis purposes  as  confirm ed 
by the Truth Panel .  
 
Study Duration:    The duration of study participation for each subject will be up to 12 
months  depending on the screening BI RADS score and decision to 
biopsy.   The duration of the entire study, from first subject enrolled until 
the last subject last visit is anticipated to be 24 months.

INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 BACKGROUND OF BREAST  CANCE R 
 
 Breast cancer has the highest percentage of new cases  (28%) among all female cancer cases in the 
USA [1] and is the most common cause of cancer -related death for women between ages of 20 -59 
years. Yet, it remains difficult to definitively diagnose witho ut performing a biopsy despite the 
existence of multiple screening and diagnostic imaging methodologies. According to the American College of Radiology (ACR), the ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are “evidence -based 
guidelines to assist referring physicians a nd other providers in making the most appropriate 
imaging or treatment decision for a specific clinical condition. By employing these guidelines, providers enhance quality of care and contribute to the most efficacious use of radiology . The 
guidelines are developed by expert panels in diagnostic imaging, interventional radiology, and 
radiation oncology . Each panel includes leaders in radiology and other specialties. There are more 
than 175 topics with over 850 variants in the March 2011 version” [2] . The fo cus of these 
guidelines is to address the on- going dilemma of the majority of biopsies performed resulting in a 
benign diagnosis, thus representing an excessive number of procedures and a significant burden 
on current delivery of healthcare and on the subj ect. 
 There are multiple reasons for the bias toward performing a biopsy beyond the psychological burden of a suspicious mass  in the breast . Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with variability 
in genetic and hormonal influences, which contribute to its var ied pathobiology [3] . Consequently, 
the clinical and radiographic manifestations and histopathology of breast cancer are variable . 
Furthermore, breast tissue is also heterogeneous containing fat, glandular and fibrous tissue . The 
structure of the br east and the nature of breast cancer present a great challenge for imaging 
technologies to detect cancerous masses  reliably and to differentiate them from benign masses . 
Seno ’s imaging technology  addresses  this challenge by utilizing two  very different  real time   
temporally   interleaved  modalities, opto -acoustic (OA) and diagnostic ultrasound (US), thus 
providing co -registered and temporally fused functional and anatomical information . This 
combination has the potential to add  diagnostic information to help the  radiologist  evaluate 
suspicious breast masses in an efficient manner .  
 Judah Folkman, MD, discovered that rapidly growing cancer cells need additional blood supply and gradually develop a dense microvascular network inside or around tumors required f or tumor 
growth and progression. Vascularization of the tumor occurs through a series of sequential steps before or during the multistep progression to neoplasia [4] . This vascularization or angiogenesis is 
a marker of breast cancer development and has cli nical implications in diagnosis and treatment. 
Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the process of metastasis is also angiogenesis -
dependent [5] . In this regard, pharmaceutical companies are pursuing tumor angiogenesis as one 
potential target f or breast cancer chemotherapy agents [6].

In the early stage s of cancer development , the tumor depends on blood vessels in the surrounding 
healthy tissue to support its continued growth. A tumor without its own independent supply of 
new blood vessels may be restricted in its growth to about 2 mm in size with just a few million cells and be non- life threatening [7].  
 Many of these breast tumors will remain small for years before transitioning to a rapid growth stage when the rate of the cell growth is much  greater than the rate of apoptosis and requires new 
capillary blood vessels. These angiogenesis related micro -vessels have fragmented basement  
membranes and are leaky, making them more penetrable by malignant cells than are mature vessels . This new vascul ar phase of growth is usually followed by rapid tumor growth, vessel 
leakage and metastasis [7] .  
 The ACR Practice Guideline for the Performance of Screening and Diagnostic Mammography, June 2008, states that “periodic mammography screening of age -appropr iate asymptomatic 
women is currently the only imaging modality that has been shown by the preponderance of data to reduce breast cancer mortality” [8].   Mammographic sensitivity for breast cancer detection does decline significantly with increasing 
breast  density , yet mammography is still of value  in older women with dense breasts [9]. 
Mammography uses low -dose amplitude -X-rays (ionizing radiation at around 0.7 mSv) to 
examine the breast . A screening mammography is intended to detect unsuspected breast can cer in 
asymptomatic women based on mediolateral- oblique (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) views of the 
breast . Based on the radiologists’ reading of the screening mammogram, he/she determines the 
need for further diagnostic evaluation [8].   
Accepted technologies for diagnostic evaluation include conventional diagnostic mammography, conventional diagnostic ultrasound, and MRI . Diagnostic mammography, which like screening 
mammography uses ionizing radiation, is used to evaluate subjects  who have signs and/or 
symptoms of breast disease, imaging findings of concern, or prior imaging findings requiring specific follow -up. In addition to the MLO and CC views, a diagnostic mammogra m includes 
views to evaluate a specific area of clinical concern, e.g. , spot compression, spot compression 
with magnification, and others [8].  
 Indications for  conventional diagnostic ultrasound include but are not limited to evaluation and 
characterization of palpable masses and other breast related signs and/or symptoms; evaluation of suspected or apparent abnormalities detected in other imaging studies ; initial imaging evaluation 
of palpable masses in women ≤  30 years of age ; and, in lactating and pregnant women. Unlike 
mammography, conventional diagnostic ultrasound does  not use ionizing radiation. ACR 
recommends the use of “a high -resolution, real -time linear array scanner operating at a center 
frequency of at least in the range of 10 MHz and preferably higher” . The breast sonogram is 
correlated to the clinical signs or symptoms and with mammographic and other appropriate imaging studies [ 9].

Color Doppler has bee n used as an adjunct to conventional diagnostic ultrasound because once 
malignant masses  achieve a certain size they need to generate neovascularity to sustain further 
growth.  Color Doppler uses phase information to assess direction and velocity of blood flow. 
Color Doppler is very user dependent and  has not been completely  success ful in demonstrat ing 
tumor neovascularity. Power Doppler assesses amplitude changes, does not assess direction of 
flow, but is more sensitive to low flow states and less angle dependent than color Doppler. It demonstrates tumor neovascularity slightly better than does color D oppler in most cases .  
However, power D oppler  is still very operator dependent and is also not completely successful in 
demonstrating tumor neovascularity.  
 While the role of ultrasound has been primarily diagnostic, as described above, its role as an ancillary screening test in women who have dense tissue on mammography (where mammographic sensitivity is reduced and breast cancer risk is increased) is expandi ng. It has been 
shown repeatedly that ancillary screening ultrasound can find 3 to 4 per thousand cancers that are missed on mammography in women who have dense breasts, causing more and more centers to offer this service. One of the costs of ancillary ult rasound screening is false positive studies that 
ultimately result in biopsy of benign mass es. As the role of ancillary screening breast ultrasound 
expands, the number of potential biopsies of benign mass es will surely increase unless more 
accurate and app ropriate characterization of benign mass es is found thus obviating the need for 
biopsy.  
 MRI does not use ionizing radiation to produce computerized images of internal body tissues and is based on nuclear magnetic resonance of atoms within the body induced by the application of a 
strong magnetic field and radiofrequency waves . MRI is typically reserved for screening of high 
risk women, i.e., greater than 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer, assessing the extent of a new 
breast cancer prior to definitive inte rvention assessing the effect of chemotherapy or a known 
malignancy and additional evaluation of clinical or imaging findings  as a problem solving 
technique . Ultrasound is often used to further charact erize abnormalities detected by MRI.  
 According to ACR, MRI equipment specifications and performance should take into account resolution, contrast and field strength, simultaneous bilateral imaging, use of contrast agents , 
scanning time , and use of a dedicated MRI breast coil [ 10].  
 Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a metabolic image and is used in some instances for diagnostic evaluation but not as widely as other modalities . Breast -specific gamma imaging is another problem- solving tool in breast imaging that 
uses injection of a gamma- emitting radioisotope to detect breast cancers but is not in wide use .  
 Depending on the outcome of the diagnostic evaluation, the subject  may be referred for breast 
biopsy, to establish a histopathologic diagnosis . The breast imaging challenge, therefore, is to 
concurrently maximize the sensitivity and specificity to increase detection of breast cancer while decreasing the number of biopsies and while utilizing lower cost technologies and procedures.

1.2 Investigational Device – Mechanism of Action  
 
OA imaging is based on the capability of optical pulses to generate diagnostic ultrasound (acoustic pressure) [ 11-13]. Pulses of near -infrared light at two wavelengths are applied 
sequentially to breast tissue . Internal optical absorption leads to the preferential deposition of 
energy in tissue volumes with an enhanced absorption coefficient (i.e., malignant masses  and 
vasculature) . Red light (757nm) is absorbed predominantly by hypoxic  (de-oxygenated)  blood, 
while near -infrared light (1064nm) is absorbed predominantly by normally oxygenated blood. The 
amount of light (optical fluence) is below the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE ) for single 
pulse exposure and maximum power for a pulse train of continuous pulses  according to the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standards for Safe Use of Lasers ( ANSI Z136.1) . 
The light excitation causes a mass  to emit a pressure (acoustic) wave, which is detected by an 
array of acoustic sensors within the hand- held bre ast probe [ 14]. OA imaging technology has the 
merit of both the high contrast resolution of optical imaging and the high  spatial  resolution  and 
penetration of ultrasound  imaging which has been established in numerous studies and published 
in peer reviewed  literature [ 15-21]. OA technology incorporates laser illumination and ultrasonic 
detection and is expected to achieve sensitivity and enhanced resolution in the breast tissue at  
depths more than sufficient to image any breast size . In prior studies Seno  has demonstrated the 
capability of OA imaging to visualize a 1 mm diameter target at the depth of 8 cm in a custom-
designed tissue phantom . The phantom used a 2% milk/distilled water mixture to obtain optical 
properties of µ a = 0.1/cm (optical absorption) , µs’= 9.8/cm (optical scattering), and g = 0.8 
(anisotropy) with a 1 mm Teflon tube containing heparinized blood.  
 
Proprietary algorithms perform co -registration of OA and diagnostic ultrasound images and 
provide much more detailed diagnostic information than the two technologies applied alone in a sequential manner; refer to Figure 1.

Simultaneously, a diagnostic ultrasound image is acquired and co-registered  with the OA image, 
providing a co- registered temporally interleaved  and fused functional and anatomical map of the  
suspicious mass  or abnormal tissue . This information, based on blood concentration in the 
neovasculature  of the suspicious area and its oxygen saturation, is unique to OA technology.  
 
The main chromophores in tissue that absorb illumination in the near -infrared range are 
oxygenated or deox ygenated molecules of hemoglobin in the blood. The contrast in OA imaging 
largely results from the paradigm of  uneven  vascular  distribut ion in herent to  cancer . Growing 
cancerous tumors develop an extensive network of blood vessels through the process of angiogenesis  where there is  increased blood flow to the cancerous tissue.  
 Seno ’s Imagio  will be tested as a n alternative to current commercially available ultrasound- only 
technology, which is used as the adjunctive technology for women found to have a suspi cious 
mass after a screening mam mography . Unlike other functional imaging modalities, such as MRI,

Seno ’s technology does not require any contrast agent . Seno ’s imaging modality is expected to 
uniquely increase diagnostic confidence by revealing the two functional hallmarks of a potential 
malignancy :  the presence of abnormal blood vessels (angiogenesis) and the r elative reduction in 
oxygen content of hemoglobin, in addition to the architecture and density of the suspicious area as 
defined by the diagnostic ultrasound component of the system .  
 
1.3 Previous Studies  
 
Early research proof of concept studies provided the company with supporting data to modify and 
enhance diagnostic performance of the  Imagio  by functional characteristics of real time opto -acoustic 
imaging performed  at two wavelengths of Nd:YAG or Alexandrite lasers . Imagio  was also tested on gelatin 
phantoms simulating dense breast with blood vessels having blood with various degree s of oxygen  
saturation . Experiments demonstrated that OA imaging is capable of not only visualizing shape and 
dimensions of blood vessels, but also differentiating deoxygenated blood from oxygenated blood.  
 
Seno  has completed enrollment into its Exploratory Study , “Clinical evaluation of Opto -Acoustic 
Tomography for detection and diagnostic differentiation of breast tumors”, Cancer Therapy and Research 
Center ( CTRC ), at the University of Texas Science Center in San Antonio, TX, under the institution’s IRB 
approval for a non -significant risk study.  
 The Exploratory Study collect ed data to refine the electro -mechanical design, including software and user 
interface so that a robust and consistent algorithm could be trained on a stable system configuration . A 
total of 55 subject s were enrolled at CTRC . Critical hardware  and software  components that affect signal 
acquisition (i.e., optical, probe, analog, and analog/digital components) were finalized at the close of this study and locked down.  
 
Over 150 subjects were  enrolled in the complete  Feasibility Study to determine the ability of Imagio to 
help detect benign and malignant features to aid the radiologist in making more accurate diagnoses  and 
the appropriate biopsy decision .  This study was conducted  at the Cancer Therapy and Research Center 
(CTRC) at The University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, Texas and at South Texas 
Radiology Imaging Centers (STRIC) under the institutions IRB approvals for non -significant risk.  The 
Feasibility St udy provide d data to train the algorithm and to identify separate sets of features that 
characterize benign and malignant disease.  T he Feasibility Study include d subjects with negative 
diagnostic ultrasound ( NDU ) results and positive diagnostic ultrasound   (PDU ) results of varying 
histo pathology diagnoses , size s, location s, dept hs, ages, ethnicities, and race s. These subject -specific 
characteristics are intended to identify any unusual subpopulations ; to date, there are no such known 
exclusions other than subjects with obscured views and subjects on medications with the potential to 
activate dermatologic conditions.  The Feasibility Study provided the estimates used to compute the 
Pivotal Study sample size.   
 
1.4     Rationale for the PIONEER Study  
 
Imagio   is not yet approved for use and must be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)

before it can be distributed for commercial use .  If Imagio is approv ed for use , then potential benefits 
include sparing biopsies as well as improving the ability  to diagnose cancer s missed by  conventional  
diagnostic ultrasound and mammography.  There is also an unmet need in BI -RADs 4a subjects, where the 
risk of malignancy is low , but biopsy is mandatory, resulting in a large percentage of biopsies of benign 
mass es.  If Imagio can successfully  downgrade benign masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b  to  BI -
RADS 2 or 3  by reducing the a priori risk  of malignancy 5 -fold (according to the POM), then subject s can 
be offered the option of short interval follow -up di agnostic ultrasound studies. Thus Imagio could  
improve efficiencies in diagnosis .  In addition, the reduced discomfort of the procedure  and minimal 
potential side effects  are further considerations.  For physicians, increased diagnostic certainty enhances 
subject  care . Last, t here may be  cost savings  for payers and for the healthcare system , resulting both 
from a reduction in the number of biopsies (i.e., those benign masses which  have a reduced POM 
following Imagio ), and from a greater diagnostic confidence when a biopsy is required  that leads to 
earlier intervention . A more efficient diagnostic pathway  may benefit all affected constituents in the 
screening and  diagnosis of breast cancer.    
 
The components used within the Imagio system have  a proven safety record .  Both lasers and 
conventional diagnostic ultrasound  have been used in diagnostic procedure  for decades  with acceptable 
risk profiles . Imagio , which uniquely combines opto -acoustic and diagnostic ultrasound  technology , will 
be tested to see if it will allow physicians to rapidly and effectively discern between benign and malignant 
mass es with minimal potential side effects.  
 
2  STUDY OBJECTIVES   
 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Imagio for the visualization and classification  of suspicious masses when compared to the Imagio  ultrasound  component .  The 
following outcomes  will be evaluated to determine whether I magio : 
 
1. Has superior specificity relative to I US (primary) with non -inferior sensitivity (secondary)  relative 
to IUS.  
2. Has clinically acceptable predictive value of a positive test (PPV) and of a negative test (NPV) for a 
range of possible  breast cancer prevalence . 
3. Downgrades benign masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b according to IUS . 
4. Downgrades benign masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a or 4b according to the site investigator.  
5. Upgrades malignant masses classified as BI -RADS 3, 4a, or 4b relative to IUS.  
6. Achieves  a high degree of concordance with the biopsy outcome.  
7. Is safe .  
 Color or power Doppler data may be optionally collected during the conventional diagnostic ultrasound examination at the discretion of the site investigator for research purposes. Data from Imagio evaluation of lymph nodes will also be optionally collected for research purposes.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
 
This is a prospective, controlled, multi- center observational study that will compare the combined 
ultrasound and opto -acoustics results of Imagio with the ultrasound component of Imagio (“internal 
control”) .  Investigators will have the option to also collect color or power Doppler  information during the 
conventional ultrasound examination on a case -by-case basis .  The Doppler information will not be used 
in the analysis of this study for determining the safety and effectiveness of Imagio.    
 
The study will initially consent subjects who have al ready had a suspicious finding within the previous 45 
business  days, by palpation or by a screening or diagnostic methodology other than ultrasound  and are 
scheduled to undergo  or already have had  a conventional diagnostic ultrasound  as per the site best 
practice guidelines .  At least 2,000 subjects will be prospectively  enrolled  upon confirmation of being BI -
RADS 3 , BI-RADS 4, or BI -RADS 5 to obtain  a sufficient number of benign  masses (at least 1,000 masses)  
and, if there is not a sufficient number , then the total number of subjects may increase slightly to achieve 
the target number for benign  masses.  All selected subjects will then undergo an I magio  evaluation  that 
must take place  before any scheduled  biopsy ; if a biopsy is to be performed, then the biopsy specimen 
may be evaluated by an independent histopathologist . Following Seno’s Medical Director review, in 
selected cases, histopathologic specimens from core and / or excisional biopsies will be sent to ce ntral 
pathology for review .  Subjects that may be selected for central pathology review would include:  
 
1. High risk lesions  
2.  Lesions  with histologic -imaging discordance   
3. Some with classically positive or classically negative OA studies  
4. Some of whom are suspected of having false positive or false negatives OA studies . 
5.  Other lesions as designated by the Seno ’s Medical Director  
 
All subjects not undergoing an immediate biopsy will be followed for an additional 12 months with an Imagio  evaluation at the end of the 12 month follow -up.  If possible , for subject management efficiency, 
once the subject agrees to participate in the study and her biopsy  date  is determined, then she can be 
scheduled for Imagio  evaluation  after the biopsy decision and sche duling, but prior to the biopsy.  
Follow -up will end when the subject undergoes a biopsy prior to 12 months or once the subject has been 
followed for 12  months.   The decision to  biops y will be made solely by the site according to best practice 
without cons idering the Imagio evaluation outcome , but may include the CDU evaluation ; if a biopsy is to 
be performed, then the biopsy specimen may be evaluated by an independent histopathologist .

1 The decision to biopsy is made upon investigational site’s standard of care and not based on the

A multi -reader, multi- case ( MRMC ) methodology will be used  for the Pivotal Study  where 7 independent 
radiologists passing prospective proficiency criteria will evaluate each of the Pivotal Study subjects for the 
registration reads (Imagio and IUS image sets) and 3 other qualified independent radiologists will share 
the evaluat ion of  each of the Pivotal Study subjects for the reimbursement reads . The total number of 
subjects depends on  accruing at least 1,000  benign   masses and if there is not a sufficient number then 
the total number of masses  may increase slightly to achieve the minimum  number of 1,000 benign  
masses . The readers will also re read  5% of the registration cases and 2.5% of the reimbursement cases  to 
assess temporal trends intra -observer variability and consistency.  
 
Each registration reader will review the data from  two image sets (IUS and Imagio) for each case; each 
independent read er will evaluate  Imagio  according to a pre -determined diagnostic rule set based on OA 
image characteristics  and will similarly evaluate IUS according to another pre -determined diagnostic rule 
set where  each reader will estimate  the probability that the mass is  cancer on a scale from 0 % to 100%  in 
5% increment s (1% if <10% or >90%).  Readers will assess the image sets in the following  pre-defined 
order during independent review sessions; this pre -defined order is consistent with medical practice :  
Imagio diagnostic ultrasound alone  (IUS)  
Imagio (diagnostic ultrasound plus opto -acoustics).  
 
The final sample size of the Pivotal Study will be determined by an interim analysis after the first 800 
Pivotal Study  subjects (cases 101 -900 passing Quality Assurance review) have been evaluated with Imagio 
plus the results of any pre -scheduled biopsies ; the final sample size will depend on the  numbers of 
masses  biopsie d, the percent of biopsied  masses  with a cancer diagnosis, and the sensitivit ies and 
specificities for Imagio and IUS  among biopsied masses .  The interim analysis will be conducted once at 
least four of the seven registration readers complete the review of the 800 cases.  Results will be shared with partners for business planning purp oses but will not be shared with sites or published until the study 
is completed.   
 
3.2. Independent Reader Sele ction   
 The study will utilize quality assurance readers (QARs) and independent readers (IRs) chosen based upon their education, experience, and  training.   Each receive training appropriate to their roles.  QARs receive 
training how to check videos, image frames, and annotations.  IRs receive training how to use reading 
stations, how to evaluate image sets based on standardized materials and case  studies, how to complete 
and submit eCRFs, and how to receive real time feedback on their performance.  All training is either led 
or supervised by the study Medical Director.  The IR training process is conducted over a period of several months, and incl udes the following:  
    
 
 
Seno Clinical Study Protocol: PIONEER -01 Confidential

1.       During off- site sessions, the IRs are trained in the protocol, GCP and 21 CFR Part 11, the Imagio  
device operation, the core imaging database, eCRF entry, and how to review Imagio images 
including the features.  
2.       During webinars, the IRs receive additional training how to evaluate Imagio videos and frames.  
3.       The IRs review image sets, enter their evaluations into a training database, and receive feedback 
in a group -setting.  
4.       The IRs receive additional train ing on the core imaging database (LifeRx and CLIB) and the 
process for eCRF completion . 
 A multi -stage process is implemented to establish reader proficiency and to select independent readers 
using Feasibility Study data, Validation and Verification Study data, and the Pilot Study data.  The Pilot Study (Pilot Phase of the Pivotal Study) data are used to confirm the acceptability of the existing algorithm to be evaluated according to a pre -determined diagnostic rule set based on OA image 
characteristics (established in the  previously conducted Feasibility Study ). The Pilot Study collects imaging 
data from 100 subjects passing Quality Assurance review conducted by three central radiologists under 
the direction of the ICC.  A pool of at least 20 other independent radiologists not affiliated with the ICC or 
any sites will be  prospectively trained by the Seno  Medical Director through face -to-face and webinar 
lectures as well as through reading practice sessions.  All such trained readers ar e then screened by Se no 
for willingness to cooperate and ability to understand opto -acoustics.  Equipment is then installed in their 
preferred reading environment and reading software i s loaded for conducting further practice sessions.  
These readers a re then tested for profic iency using the image sets constructed by the central radiologists 
using the last 70 of the 100 Pilot cases; the first 30 cases are  not be used in order to let individual readers 
get familiar with the image sets, the viewing logistics, and the eCRF to be c ompleted.  Readers are not 
given a second chance to establish proficiency unless the pool of proficient readers is depleted due to 
reader dropouts.  
 
Upon establishing and meeting prospective rules for proficiency (based on Imagio sensitivity [missing at 
most one cancer] and Imagio specificity > 30% after excluding the first 30 cases to allow for learning), a 
subset of 7 proficient readers are selected for registration  reads (IUS and Imagio) and 3 other readers are 
selected for reimbursement.  The registratio n readers are selected among those meeting  the proficiency 
standard; reimbursement readers are  selected by the Seno  Medical Director.

All registration readers will be tested and selected prior to making any further Pivotal Study reads for 
subjects 101  and beyond  which will constitute the Pivotal Study . All effectiveness analyses will be 
conducted at  the mass -level; it is projected that no more than 5% of all subjects will have multiple 
masses. A minimum of  100 Pilot Study cases and 1, 700 Pivotal Study cases must pass QA review and must 
not be enrollment failures to be included in the respective Pilot and Pivotal Stud y analys es.  Enrollment 
will continue until there are 100 Pilot Study cases and at least 1, 700 Pivotal Study cases that pass both 
criteria.   The 100 Pilot Study cases will be used for education, training, and publication purposes; only the 
Pivotal Study cases will be used to support Imagio registration for this indication for use.  
 All selected registration readers will evaluate all masses th at pass QA review according to a MRMC design  
for the pivotal phase .  To mimic the real world setting as closely as possible, all readers will receive 
respective feedback on the histopathology results after completing their locked evaluations; readers may 
not change results after receiving feedback .   
 
For the Pivotal Study component, subsets of 5% of registration image sets and 2.5% of all reimbursement 
image sets will be reread to assess learning and consistency ; the first  reads will be used in the data 
analyses for registration and reimbursement .  Readers will be required to turn in their evaluations before 
conducting the rereads which will be  conducted once the respective reader completes their Pivotal Study 
reads.  
 
3.3. Rationale for Study Design and C ontrol Group s 
 
Imagio will be assessed as a diagnostic test in the characterization of suspicious breast masses. The conventional  diagnostic ultrasound  will serve as the “external control”  while the diagnostic ultrasound  
component of Imagio will serve as an “internal control .”  The primary focus will be on the evaluation 
using the internal control.  
 
The ultimate diagnosis depends on the histopathology examination of the biopsy from the suspected 
mass by a n independent   Histopath ologist. The Histopathologist can elect to select slides for th e final 
diagnosis review.  This diagnosis will be included in the PMA submission.  After designating the diagnosis, 
the independent Histopatho logist may  assess histopathologic specimens  to better correlate specific 
internal and peritumoral findings (such as vessel density, neovessel count, cell density, type of host 
response to tumor, internal necrosis and hemorrhage, water content, etc.) with the opto -acoustic images 
and to help better understand the causes of opto -acoustic findings.   Results of th e  detailed 
histopathology  review  will be p ublished separately from the FDA submission but will be available to 
regulatory agencies upon request .  
 
Following Seno’s Medical Director review, in selected cases, histopathologic specimens from core and / or excisional biopsies will be sent to central pathology for review.  Subjects that may be selected for central 
pathology review would include:  
1. High ris k lesions  
2. Lesions with histologic -imaging discordance  
3. Some with classically positive or classically negative OA studies  
4. Some of whom are suspected of having false positive or false negatives OA studies.

 In the absence of new findings, th e decision to not recommend a biopsy during the first 12 months will be 
regarded as evidence of no disease , True Negative (TN) for those not biopsied; this is in accordance with 
FDA guidance regarding study analysis  conventions .  
 The study design will evaluate the specificity  as the 
primary effectiveness endpoint and the sensitivity as secondary effectiveness endpoint for comparing Imagio relative to the pre -biopsy conventional diagnostic ultrasound  images and histo logy results (if 
biopsy is performed). To ensure consistency, the assessment of all imaging studies including Imagio will be managed  by an independent Imaging Coordination Committee (ICC) to coordinate  the pool of 
potential readers for the Pilot /Pivotal  Study and the subset of 7 qualifying readers for the P ivotal Study in 
accordance with FDA MRMC imaging review guidelines .  Each registration reader will independently 
evaluate  both  image sets per subject once all imaging data are available  per subject .   
In addition, a Truth Panel will consist o f at least  two independent expert radiologists and a 
Histopathologist ; the Truth Panel will work closely with the Sponsor and /or designee to adjudicate all 
cases and to review anomalies relating to pathology, imaging, subject history, and clinical course  for the 
additional purpose of alerts regarding subjects at risk for malignancy , but not biopsied.    
The major anticipated advantages of co-registered OA and B- mode  imaging are as follows:  
 
1. High optical contrast between potentially malignant and benign tissues that  results from 
enhanced density of the microcirculation network within and around masse s and enhanced 
thermo -elastic expansion coefficient in potentially malignant masse s; 
2. High sensit ivity of detection due to efficient opto -thermal generation of pressure in masse s, and 
sensitive detection of resulting ultrasonic waves with novel piezoelectric array s; and 
3. High ( ≤1 mm) spatial resolution that  results from pulsed laser excitation and time -resolved 
detection of ultrasonic signal profiles with array detectors;  
4. Substantial depth of monitoring (up to 8 cm in tissue phantoms) that  results from deep 
penetration of the near -infra- red photons in tissues, efficient conversion of laser energy into 
acoustic pressure waves propagating through the breast , with negligible  attenuation and minimal 
distortion, and from high sensitivity of piezoelectric arrays ; and  
5. Applicability to breasts of a broad range of mammographic density, including those with 
radiographically dense breasts.
 
3.4.  Study Duration  
 Subjects are to be enrolled after decision to biopsy  or not to biopsy .   Each subject will undergo consent 
to have an Imagio evaluation , which must be completed within 10 business days of t he Enrollment Visit; 
the Imagio evaluation  must be performed prior to any biopsy.  Thus all selected subjects will undergo an 
Imagio  evaluation  following conventional diagnostic ultrasound and in some cases mammography before 
any immediate biopsy.  For subject managemen t efficiency, once the subject agrees to participate in the 
study and her biopsy is scheduled, she can then be scheduled for Imagio prior to the biopsy.  The subjects 
must have the Imagio evaluation within 45  business days before the biopsy . Core needle bi opsy, image 
guided directional vacuum assisted needle biopsy  (DVAB) , or surg ical biopsy will be performed.   For

subjects requiring a second biopsy, additional time (up to 45 business days) will be permitted to perform 
the second biopsy .  Any such decisions to biopsy will be made solely by the site without considering any  
Imagio evaluation outcom es. 
  
 
All subjects not undergoing an immediate biopsy will be followed clinically for an addit ional 12 months .  
All subjects will have an Imagio  evaluation at the first Imaging Visit   and a subsequent Imagio  evaluation  
before any subsequent biopsy that might be necessary because of an interval clinical finding during the 
12 month follow -up or because of a 6 month follow -up conventional diagnostic ultrasound that has been 
recommended by the investigator . If the interval clinical problem does not result in a recommendation 
for biopsy,  the investigator may schedule a 6 or 12 month follow -up visit at their discretion. Follow -up 
will end when  either:  
1. The subject undergoes a biopsy by  12 months , or  
2. Once  the subject has been followed f or at least  12 months . 
 
Any such decisions to biopsy will be made solely by the site investigator without considering the Imagio  
evaluation outcom e.  
 
Each subject will attend up to 4  visits:  
• A Screening Visit . 
• An Enrollment Visit (Day 1) .  
• 1 or 2 Imaging Visits (Day 1 to Day 10; a second Imaging Visit will occur for any biopsy within 12 
months for those subjects with a biopsy scheduled before the first Imaging Visit) . 
• A Follow -Up Visit at 12 months ( if no biopsy is scheduled within 12 months of the Enrollment 
Visit) . 
The Screening Visit, Enrollment Visit, and 1st Imaging Visit may all occur in proper sequential order in one 
day.  
 
3.5.  Ultrasound Visualization and Annotation 
 
The conventional diagnostic ultrasound part of the study will include at least  orthogonal viiew  Radial and 
Anti-Radial views of the mass  or longitudinal and transverse views ). In some cases, additional views may 
be necessary (when the maximum d iameter is not in Radial and Anti- radial planes, for example). The scan 
protocols will be those recommended in the “ACR 2011 Practice Guidelines for the Performance of a 
Breast Ultrasound Examination ”, except that the subject  name, hospital reference number, and birth date 
will be excluded from the image for purposes of maintaining anonymity. (The PDF file for the ACR 
guidelines is attached in Appendix C.)  
 The views will be properly annotated to be ACR BI -RADS  breast ultraso und lexicon compliant and will 
include:  
1.  Breast side  
2.  Clock -face position  
3.  Distance from the nipple

4.  Transducer orientation   
 
A mass  at 10:00 in the right breast 8 cm from the nipple scanned in the radial plane would be at R 10:00 
N8 RAD . 
 Views will be obtained with and without measurement calipers.  The presence of calipers may interfere 
with surface characteristics evaluation from standard diagnostic and I magio gray scale images.  
 
The views obtained during the Imagio scan and the labeling of the Imagio views must precisely replicate 
the views and annotation used for the diagnostic ultrasound part of the study. The exact views used for diagnostic ultrasound will  be established  during the Imagio scan.  At a minimum, two orthogonal views 
(longitudinal/tran sverse or radial/anti- radial) will include both freeze frame images with and without 
calipers, and slow video “sweeps” through the lesion in both planes.   
 
Color or power Doppler images may be collected during the conventional ultrasound examination for 
research purposes , but must be obtained in the same views used for diagnostic  ultrasound and for the 
Imagio scan  and must be annotated identically to the diagnostic gray scale and Imagio  image s.  
 
The acoustic gel used will either be provided by or approve d for use  by Seno. The gels will be non -
colored, as colored gel is anticipated to interfere with the optical part of the opto -acoustic examination . 
 
All images used for this  study will be anonymized  to be HIP AA compliant  prior to review by the 
independent QA evaluators  and the independent readers .  Subjects in this study will be assigned 
identifying subject numbers and their names and medical facility record numbers will be hidden on all accumulated images. The images will identify the subject only by subject numbers. The database that links the subj ect number with the subject names, medical facility record numbers, and birth dates will be 
maintained by the chief investigator and co -investigator and access to this database will be limited to the 
investigators  and the Seno Medical Instruments, Inc.  site monito r. 
 Informed consent will be obtained before Imagio imaging can be performed. The c onsent form te mplate 
is included in Appendix B . 
 
4. STUDY POPULATION SEL ECTION 
 
4.1. Study Population  
 At least 2,000 subjects will be prospectively enrolled upon confirmation of being BI -RADS 3, BI -RADS 4, or 
BI-RADS 5 to obtain a sufficient number of benign masses (at least 1,000 masses) and, if there is not a 
sufficient number, then the total number of subjects may increase slightly to achieve the target number for benign masses.    The following  masses  will be considered enrollment failures:

5. DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
5.1. Description of Investigational Device  
 
Imagio  utilizes acoustic pressure waves generated by stimulating the tissue with pulsed laser energy to 
obtain images of the tissue structures , including those containing concentrations of oxygenated and 
deoxygenated hemoglobin . It also uses diagnostic ultrasound  transmitted and received signals to form 
diagnostic ultrasound  images of the internal soft tissue . The investigational device consists of these sub -
systems  and components : 
 5.1.1  Opto -acoustic Probe: A handheld OA linear probe  contain s a wideband diagnostic ultrasound 
array that can  be used as a  traditional diagnostic ultrasound transducer over a range of frequencies from  
4 MHz to 16 MHz at 20 dB power point  and can also r eceive optic ally generated acoustic frequencies that 
    
 
 
Seno Clinical Study Protocol: PIONEER -01 Confidential  
300176 Rev  8  PIONEER 01 Protocol Amendment 3.2   
Eff. Date: October 15, 2015 
 Page 30 of 80 
  
range from 0.1 MHz to 18 MHz at 20 db power point. With the integrated  laser light delivery system , the 
hand -held prob e can  operate in a multiplexing mode so that the same probe can be used to create co -
registered, temporally interleaved and fused functional OA and anatomic diagnostic ultrasound . The OA 
duplex probe footprint is no greater than 56 mm long by 36 mm wide , with the ultrasound transducer size 
being 38 mm long by 4 mm wide.  
 
5.1.2  Laser : A Class IIIB laser subsystem generates the necessary output energy, pulse widths and 
wavelengths to provide the breast illumination to initiate the OA effect . The laser component is based on 
laser technology found in previously 510(k) cleared dermatological devices; the lasers are supplied by a FDA registered OEM manufacturer. The lasers are activated via a footswitch . 
 
5.1.3  Electronics : The system electronics provide the necessary signal processing, control, digital 
processing and image reconstruction to convert OA and diagnostic ultrasound  signals into the desired 
clinical displays and operations, and to combine those with similarly generated diagnostic ultras ound  
images.  
 5.1.4  Diagnostic Ultrasound : The diagnostic ultrasound subsystem is provided by an FDA registered 
OEM manufacturer. The system is capable of processing and displaying conventional  diagnostic 
ultrasound  images  as well as co-registered OA and B -mode images .  
 5.1.5  Software : The software controls the overall data flow from the data acquisition process to the 
display of the final co-registered  OA and diagnostic ultrasound images.  The system continuously acquires 
both OA data from the dual lasers and diagnostic ultrasound  images from the diagnostic ultrasound 
subsystem. Ancillary data such as the physician annotations are stored and saved in DICOM format.  
 
5.2. Potential  Risks  
 
Risks associated with the intended use of I magio  include potential laser exposure, acoustic output 
exposure, and contamination due to insufficient cleaning/disinfection of subject/user contacting 
materials .   Section 5.4 identifies potential risks to study  subjects.  
 
In addition to these risks, Seno  has considered the following potential sources of risk to the subject or 
operator:   
 
5.2.1  Applicable Energy Hazards : Electrical, heat, mechanical force/moving parts, non -ionizing 
radiation, and electromagnetic fields; comparable to other electro -mechanical software controlled 
devices, with the following exception : 
 
When I magio  is prepared for imaging, the laser shutter can be opened and the laser will deliver near 
infrared pulses to the subjec ts’ breast through a light delivery system. All  subjects  and study personnel in 
or near the experimental area will wear eyewear  specially designed for protection against laser 
illumination in the near infrared spectral range. However, no leakage of laser light is anticipated  from 
either laser system or light delivery system . Laser illumination at safe levels will be used for the proposed 
in vivo studies, according to FDA Performance Standards for Light -Emitting Products, 21 CFR Part 1040, 
1998.

ANSI Z136.1 -1993, “American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers,” published by the American 
National Standards Institute, Inc, defines the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) for laser irradiation of skin as equal to 20 to 100 mJ/cm
2 depending on the wavelength in the spectral range from 700 nm to 
1100 nm (Nd:YAG laser or Alexandrite laser) and low repetition rate of nanosecond laser pulses [ 22]). The 
repetition rate of laser pulses must be limited to assure that the laser -induced pressure and heat 
dissipates from the irradiated volume during the time between two consecutive laser pulses.  The OA 
functionality has been tested to be below the Maximum  Perm issible Exposure (MPE ) for single pulse 
exposure and maximum power for a pulse train of continuous pulses .   
 In addition to testing the MPE for laser radiance, Seno  has separately tested the acoustic output of the 
diagnostic ultrasound subsystem according to FDA’s “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Information for 
Manufacturers Seeking Marketing Clearance of Diagnostic Ultrasound Systems and Transducers,” 
September 9, 2008.  
 Seno  also assessed the cumulative non -ionizing radiation exposure from  the laser and ultrasound  
subsystems as well as transient temperature effects (individual and combined thermal effect), on blood, blood vessels, and adjacent tissues in the laser/ultrasound propagation pathway .    
 Conclusion: On the basis of this informat ion, FDA notified Seno  on October 28, 2011 that the Imagio 
breast imaging system is non -significant risk for this study.  
 
5.2.2 .  Applicable Biological Hazards : Bio-burden, bio -contamination, toxicity, cross -infection, inability to 
maintain hygienic safety, and degradation  are comparable to other electro -mechanical software 
controlled devices . Subject/user contacting materials have been assessed and found to be commonly 
used in commercially available medical devices . Seno  has contracted with  NAMSA, No rthwood, OH, to 
conduct the required biocompatibility testing to ISO 10933 : Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 
1: Evaluation and Testing. This testing is currently on -going.   
 
Cleaning and disinfection of the OA probe with  Sani-Cloth ® AF3 Germicidal Disposable Wipes  is described 
in the Study Instructions for Use Manual. Cleaning and disinfection of the OA probe is  required prior to 
the first subject of the day and after each subject.  
 5.2.3.  Environmental Hazards : Electromagnetic, inadequate supply of power, restriction of cooling, 
likelihood of operation outside of prescribed environmental conditions, storage outside of prescribed 
environmental conditions, incompatibility with other devices, accidental mechanical damage, 
contaminat ion due to waste products and/or device disposal  are comparable to other electro -mechanical 
software controlled devices.  
 
5.2.4.  Hazards related to the Use of the Device : reasonably foreseeable misuse of the device, system 
noise, and use of the device by unskilled personnel, incorrect measurement and other metrological 
aspects, incorrect diagnosis, incompatibility with consumables/accessories/other devices, hazards from 
contraindicated pharmaceuticals, and hazards from contraindicated subject classes;  comparable to other 
electro -mechanical software controlled devices.

5.2.5.  Hazards arising from Functional Failure, Maintenance, and Aging : inadequacy of performance 
charact eristics for intended use, lack of or inadequate specification for maintenance, including 
inadequate specification of post -maintenance functional checks, inadequate maintenance, lack of 
adequate determination of end of device life, loss of electrical /mech anical integrity, inadequate 
packaging (contamination/deterioration of the device), improper reuse, delayed cumulative effects from 
long- term use; comparable to other electro -mechanical software controlled devices.  
 
5.2.6  General Hazards : hazards introduce d by changes made to manage risk, hazards from design 
changes, and hazards from system assembly; comparable to other electro -mechanical software 
controlled devices.  
 
5.2.7  Testing and Mitigation of Hazards : Seno Medical  Instruments, Inc.  has conducted appropriate 
design verification and design validation testing  to ensure that device related risks are controlled and that 
the residual risk is at acceptable levels for this type of investigational device . Seno  has performed testing 
according  to the FDA recognized standards listed in the table below.   In those cases where risk could not 
be mitigated via design, labeling and training serves to notify the investigator of potential hazards  or 
hazardous situations in the instructions for use and/o r in the exclusion criteria for this protocol, e.g., 
exclude women with or undergoing treatment for a photosensitive disease to mitigate risk of 
exacerbating a pre -existing condition such as lupus erythematosus .

5.4.     Reader Training  
The independent reader s (IRs) were chosen based upon their education, experience, and ability to receive 
a passing score on a pre -read Proficiency Test.    All IRs received the same training, using the same 
materials and IMAGIO images, and all trainings were either led or supervi sed by the study Medical 
Director.   The process of training was conducted over a period of several months, and included the 
following:  
 
1. During off- site sessions, the IRs are trained in the protocol, GCP and 21 CFR Part 11, the Imagio  
device operation, the core imaging database, eCRF entry, and how to review Imagio images 
including the features.  
2. During webinars, the IRs receive additional training how to evaluate Imagio videos and frames.  
3. The IRs review image sets, enter their evaluations into a training dat abase, and receive  feed  back  
in a group -setting.  
4. The IRs receive additional training on the core imaging database (LifeRx and CLIB) and the process 
for eCRF completion . 
 
 
5.5 Truth Panel  
 
The Truth Panel will consist of a histopathologist and at least two radiologists.   
 
The histopathologist will review all pathology reports inclusive of core biopsy reports and surgical 
pathology reports for each subject with a biopsy for determining the definitive diagnosis and for 
identifying and resolving inconsistent in formation. Seno Medical representatives will provide the two 
reports to the histopathologist for review and adjudication. In addition, BMS and Seno Medical representatives will provide packets to the Truth Panel for selected cases as follows:  
 
• Cases where the number or numbering of suspicious masses is under dispute (per IRs)  
• Cases with questionable eligibility  
• Cases with high risk histology’s  as identified by the Central Histopathologist  
• Cases where individual IR’s identified problems with specific image s ets 
• Cases not biopsied and being followed  to determine if a mass was a True -Negative (TN)  
 BMS will provide selected images meeting the above criteria to the Truth Panel who will determine truth regarding benign or malignant for submitted imaging data.

The Truth Panel will collaborate to perform the following tasks:  
 
1.    Generate queries to sites to be managed by Seno Medical  
2.    Complete a CRF per patient deeming truth regarding:  
 
• Number and location of specific lesions  
• Histologic opinion and interp retation including benign or malignant classification  
• Mass -specific True -Negative designation  
 
5.6. Evaluation of Risk / Benefit  
 
There is a minimal risk ( 0.4% or 1:269 ) that a subject  may experience discomfort, including tingling or 
warmth, during the Imagio scan.  The discomfort , if experienced, is not associated with any visible skin 
changes and resolves immediately at the completion of the scan  without treatment.  To date there have 
been no reports of unanticipated adverse device ef fects for this investigation .  Previous studies using 
comparable prototype systems have been declared  to be non -significant risk .  
  
Conclusion: FDA notified Seno  on October 28, 2011, that the agency believes that the I magio  breast 
imaging system is  non-significant risk  for this study . 
 
Based on the recommendation of the QA evaluators, the independent readers, and the Truth Panel for missed masses not biopsied , the Medical Monitor will be immediately notified and will in turn notify the 
site investigator.  
 
5.7. Central Histopathology Review  
 Following Seno’s Medical Director review, in selected cases histopathologic specimens from core and / or 
excisional biopsies will be sent to central pathology for review.  Subjects that may be selected for central 
pathology review would include:  
1. High risk lesions  
2. Lesions  with histologic -imaging  discordance  
3. Some with classically true positive or classically true negative OA studies  
4. Some of whom are suspected of having false positive or false negatives OA studies . 
5.   Other lesions as designated by Seno’s M edical Director  
 
This may include the initial biopsy, any  second biopsy, and any subsequent biopsy  or surgical excision  
during the first 12 months after study enrollment.   The central h istopathology review will be used for all 
analyses.    All histopathology specimens will be labeled using the Study ID and the d ate that the 
specimen was collected.  
 
All specimens should be formalin -fixed and paraffin -embedded. Sections should be cut at a thickness no 
greater than 4 microns, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, and cover- slipped in the routine manner. 
One original slide or recut from each paraffin block and one original slide of each immunohistochemical 
stain performed should be sent via Federal Express to:

5.8. Standard Diagnostic Measure (SDM) as Comparator   
 
The diagnostic ultrasound of Imagio will serve as the “internal control”. The conventional diagnostic 
control will service as the “external control”; the CDU  must be completed within 45 business  days prior to 
the Screening Visit and interpreted before the Enrollment Visit .  If a biopsy is to be performed during the 
first 12 months, then a ny planned biopsy during the first 12 months must be scheduled to  take place 
within 30 business  days after the I magio  evaluation . The histologic findings of the  biopsy procedure will 
serve as a gold standard for I magio  and the decision to not perform a biopsy during the first 12 months 
will be regarded as evidence of no malignant disease for those not biopsied , subject to review by the 
Truth Panel . Subjects requiring a second biopsy will be allowed additional time (up to  45 business  days ) to 
undergo a second biopsy .     
 The presented study design will evaluate all images that contribute to the decision to either perform a 
biopsy or to follow the subject for up to 12 months ; this includes  mammography will be read alone and in 
combination with conventional diagnostic ultrasound and Imagio w hich w ill be separately read by the 
reimbursement readers.  The registration readers will focus on  the IUS and Imagio image sets to  be read 
in the following  pre-defined order :  
 
1.  Imagio diagnostic ultrasound  alone  (IUS)  
2.  Imagio (diagnostic ultrasound  plus opto -acoustics  [OA] ). 
 
Specific image  sets may include screening and diagnostic mammograph y as well as other diagnostic 
images  but excluding the optional color or power Doppler .  The images will be received, assigned, sent, 
recorded, and received back by the Imaging Coordinat ion Committee.  The ICC will manage the image set 
review process by the independent readers .  To preserve their independence and objectivity as well as to 
minimize bias, the independent readers  will NOT have access to any clinical data, any  decision s to biopsy , 
or to any  biopsy outcomes .  
 
The Medical  Monitor will be contacted regarding any biopsied cases where it is unclear whether the 
correct site was biopsied as well as  have access to all unbiopsied cases where the QA evaluators or the

independent readers identified a new suspicious mass with a high probability of malignancy to be 
conveyed to the respective site investigator.    
 The Data Rights Docume nt identifies the  individuals who have rights and restrictions to the de -identified 
subject data.  The investigator will not have access to the reader  reviews  (including the final 
interpretation) . The independent readers  will have access to relevant images used to make the decision 
to perform  the diagnostic ultrasound  in addition to the I magio  image s in order to perform evaluations  for 
the above -stated image series  used to evaluate the subjects for the BI -RADs 4a or 4b  classification and if a 
decision is made to biopsy .  Seno will have access to reader results once the biopsy is completed and the 
image sets are read by all registration readers.  
  
 
5.9. Comparator Device Components  
 
Imagio  is an investigational device that has not been approved for commercial use by the US FDA . 
However, FDA has notified Seno on October 28, 2011, that the agency believes that I magio  is non -
significant risk for this study.  Imagio includes  subsystems and comp onents that are comparable to 
commercially available medical devices : 
 
5.9.1. Proprietary Device N ame : PR3 Ultrasound System  
Classification : Ultrasonic imaging system  
Regulation Number: Title 21 CFR 892.1560 
Medical Specialty : Radiology  
Medical Device Regulatory Class : II (Special Controls ) 
510(K): K080935  
 
Imagio  is similar to the PR3 Ultrasound system in that both systems use ultrasound waves propagating 
through tissue to obtain images of  soft tissue . The diagnostic  ultrasound  component of Imagio  uses the 
standard parameters of the PR3 Ultrasound system . However, the opto -acoustic part of I magio  employs 
passive detection of low -amplitude ultrasound waves instead of ultrasou nd-emissions  used by the PR3 -
USI. 
 
5.9.2. Proprietary Device N ame : Candela Gentle LASE  Laser  
Classification : Dermatological Vascular Lesion Laser  
Regulation Number: Title 21 CFR 878.4810 
Medical Specialty : Dermatology  
Medical Device Regulatory Class : II (Special Controls )  
510(K): K083207  
 
Imagio  is similar to the Candela Gentle LASE  Laser in that both systems employ pulsed lasers operating in 
the near infrared spectral range, and both lasers are used for illumination of skin . Both lasers employ a 
Class IIIB  laser, with the Candela Gentle LASE  Laser  providing a higher energy per pulse .

5.10. Treatments Administered : Not applicable.  
 
5.11. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject : Not applicable.  
 
5.12. Method of Assigning Subjec ts to Treatment Groups  
 
This is a prospective, controlled, multi- center observational study where all subjects undergo  a diagnostic 
ultrasound, to make a biopsy decision , and then are consented .   All subjects will then  undergo the I magio  
evaluation following  conventional diagnostic  procedures . Thus, there is no randomization . 
 5.13. Blinding  
 
Subjects will not be blinded to study procedures but will not have access to the I magio  evaluation result.  
 
The investigator will have access to all conventional diagnostic ultrasound , mammography , and  biopsy 
report s, but the interpretation of the I magio  evaluation will not be provided to the investigator.   The 
investigator will also have the option to perform  the color or power Doppler  during the conventional 
ultrasound examination for research purposes.   The Doppler information will not be used in the analysis 
of this study for determining the safety and effectiveness of the Imagio .   
    
The 7 independent registration readers  and the 3 other independent reimbursement readers per case  will 
have separate access to the relevant  images and videos used to make the decision to perform  or defer  a 
biopsy in addition to the I magio  diagnostic ultrasound  image  and opto -acoustic image .  Imagio  and IUS 
are regarded as the two  most imp ortant image sets for comparisons ; these will be the image sets to be 
reviewed by the registration readers .  Mammography is regarded as the most likely referral methodology 
and will be read alone and in combin ation with CDU and Imagio by the reimbursement readers.  Readers 
will not have access to the background clinical information or to the histopathology report . The Truth 
Panel will have access to all clinical data, QA evaluator,  and independent reader result s to be able to alert 
the study medical monitor regarding any high risk subjects; the Seno  study coordinator  will in turn alert 
the study investigator in the event that the subject was not biopsied  or the biopsy report was missing . 
 
 
5.14. Concomitant Therapy : Not applicable.   
 5.15. Restrictions : 
None  
 
5.16. Treatment Compliance  
 
Imagio  will be operated only by study personnel trained by Seno personnel or their representatives. 
Subject compliance is ensured.

5.17. Packaging , Labeling , and Instructions  for Use   
 
Seno  will ship investigational devices to participating sites ut ilizing packaging materials that protect the 
investigational devices from potential damage during transit.   Seno personnel will unpack and install the 
study device as well as conduc t and document operator training  for study personnel . 
 
Imagio  will bear appropriate investigational device labeling, to include the statement: “Caution – 
Investigational Device . Limited by United States Law to I nvestigational Use.” 
Seno will also provide adequate instructions for use written at a comprehension level appropriate for the 
operators participating in this study; please refer to S ection 5.3.

6.2. Study Visits  
 
6.2.1  Screening Visit  
 
The following procedures will be conducted at the Screening Visit:  
1. Qualify subject  
2. Verify from images and/or reports  that a suspicious mass was seen  
3. Confirm that a conventional diagnostic ultrasound is to be performed  or has been performed.  The 
conventional diagnostic ultrasound should be performed prior to consenting the subject.  
4. Confirm that the subject has a n undiagnosed  suspicious finding within the previous 45   business 
days , by palpation or by a screening or diagnostic methodology other than ultrasound  
 
6.2.2.  Enrollment Visit, Day 1  
 
The following procedures will be c onduct ed at the Enrollment  Visit:  
1. Verify from mammograms and reports that a suspicious mass was seen  
2. Confirm that conventional  diagnostic ultrasound and all other diagnostic tests were performed  
3. Confirm that the biopsy decision has been made  
4. Review HIPAA form and informed consent form with subject and obtain signature; consent to both forms must be obtained prior to performing any study procedures.  
5. Full assess ment of subject eligibility with inclusion/exclusion criteria  
6. Record  demographics and medica l history  
7. Document  date of informed consent signature and HIPAA authorization in the eCRF . 
 
Upon completion of the conventional diagnostic ultrasound:  
8. Determine whether the subject had a conventional diagnostic ultrasound  that resulted in a 
recommendation for biopsy or a recommendation not to biopsy . 
9. Schedule I magio evaluation to take place within 1 0 business days  of the Enrollment Visit . 
 
After completion of the I magio  evaluation  and prior to the biopsy, the subject will complete the Subject 
Completed Survey .   
 Subjects may be asked to return to the clinic to repeat the Imagio scan if (a) the image quality is not acceptable for review by the independent QA evaluators and (b) they have not under gone a biopsy 
procedure.  
 
Group Determination:   For the purpose of sub ject follow -up activities, subjects will be categorized into 
the Biopsied  Group or Unbiopsied  Group.  Classification will be determined  by the respective site 
investigator based on the following criteria:  
 
    
 
 
Seno Clinical Study Protocol: PIONEER -01 Confidential  
300176 Rev  8  PIONEER 01 Protocol Amendment 3.2   
Eff. Date: October 15, 2015 
 Page 42 of 80 
  
Biopsied  Group Criteria:  
Has at least one or up to  three suspicious solid mass es or suspicious complex mixed cystic and solid 
mass es (as either the cause of the clinical or mammographic finding) that the investigator has 
characterized as either BI -RADS 4 or 5, a biopsy has been recommended for all masses and that 
subject has agreed  to have a biopsy for each suspicious mass that has been identified . 
 
Unbiopsied Group Criteria: 
 
Has at least one solid mass, complex cystic and solid mass , or indeterminate cystic versus solid lesion 
(as either the cause of clinical or mammographic finding), that the investigator has characterized as 
BI-RADS 3 or has ≤2% POM, and for which the subject has chosen to have either biopsy or short 
interval follo w-up. If greater than one mass is found and each mass is not recommended for biopsy, 
then only one mass of the site’s choice will be designated as the primary mass and will be followed for up to 12 months; Ideally, the mass with the highest POM as per the investigator will be selected 
for follow -up.  
 
6.2.3. Imaging Visit (s), Day 1 - 10  
 
Within 10 business days  of the completion of the Enrollment  Visit  and before any scheduled image -
guided biopsy , the subject will undergo  the Imagio  study  evaluation . The Imagio  evaluation  will be 
performed according to the I magio  Instructions for U se provided for this clinical study .    Subjects may be 
asked to return to the clinic to repeat the Imagio scan if (a) the image quality is not acceptable for review 
by the independent evaluators and (b) they have not under gone a biopsy procedure.  Seno Medical 
Instruments, Inc. or their designees may be present during the procedures to provide technical support.   
 The study data will be recorded using electronic data captur e (EDC) . Any adverse event s that occur during 
this Visit will be entered into the eCRF .  
 The investigator is to ensure that the site histopathology report is obtained and the relevant results are 
entered into  the eCRF .  The central histopathology report will contain cell type, histologic grade for 
invasive malignant mass es and nuclear grade for in situ carcinomas. Additionally, the Sponsor will assign a 
blinded sonographer to independently determine the  maximum diameter of the index mass  and extent of 
disease (which includes n ot only the maximum diameter of the index mass , but outside -to-outside 
dimensions between multifocal and/or multicentric invasive disease and/or maximum outside -to-outside 
largest dimension of combined invasive and in situ disease ); the sonographer may be a Sponsor employee 
without access to diagnosis, histopathology results, reader scores, and nom ogram results .  Also included 
will be estrogen, progesterone, and Her -2 receptor status, lymph node status and number  of positive 
lymph nodes. All of these histopathologic prognostic features will be entered into the eCRF. These 
histopathologic features are known to correlate with biologic behavior of the mass , as will b e its OA 
characteristics. Thus, certain OA features  are expected to correlate better with some prognostic 
histopathologic parameters than with some others.  
 If the subject does not  undergo biopsy of the breast mass  within 12  months of enrollment,  a subsequent 
Imagio evaluation will be performed together with any other indicated imaging studies at the 12 month

follow -up Visit .  In addition,  the Imagio  evaluation visit will be conducted prior to  any scheduled biopsy 
that is indicated by interval clinical and/or imaging findings within the 12 month follow -up period .  
 
 6.2.4.  Follow -up for Subjects with Subsequent Biopsy  Within 12 Months Post -Enrollment  
 Subjects who  are scheduled for biopsy because of new interval clinical or imaging findings that present 
within 12 months of the Enrollment Visit will have an I magio  evaluation in addition to  (prior to) the 
biopsy being performed .  The Imagio protocol will be performed  according to the I magio  Instructions for 
Use provided for this clinical study.  The study data will be recorded using electronic dat a capture (EDC) . 
Any adverse events that occur during this visit will be report ed. The investigator is to ensure that the 
histopathology report is obtained and  the relevant results are  entered into  the eCRF . 
 
6.2.5.  12 month Follow -up Visit for Subjects with No Biopsy  
 
For non-biopsied  subjects, a second and final Imagio evaluation and any other indicated imaging 
evaluations  will be performed at the 12 month Follow -Up Visit.   If an interval clinical and/or imaging 
problem arises before 12 months that would require a biopsy at that time, an Imagio e valuation and any 
other indicated imaging studies will be performed ( 45 days) before the biopsy.  Truth Panel confirmation 
of mass  change will be used to establish truth regarding mass changes ; if no biopsy is recommended at 
the Month 12 Evaluation, and if there are no new symptoms, no new physical findings, and no new 
imaging abnormalities, the subject will be considered to be a Tru e-Negative ( TN), subject to truth panel 
review.  
 
6.3. Study Evaluations  and Procedures  
 
6.3.1.  Informed Consent  
 
Prior to  the initiation of any study activities, written informed consent and HIPAA authorization shall be 
obtained from all subjects ; this will cover any additional data in the event that the subject is to be 
followed for 12 months and if a biopsy takes place during the subsequent 12 month follow -up. Subjects 
will authorize the investigator to submit  those  images used to make the decision to perform a biopsy  or 
to continue follow -up.    
 
6.3.2.  Demographic s 
 Demographics will be documented in the electronic C ase Report Form (eCRF ). This will include date of 
birth , race, and ethnicity .  
 
6.3.3.  Subject Survey  
 
After completion of the I magio  evaluation  and prior to the biopsy , the subjec t will complete  the Subject

Data Form.  
 
6.3.4.  Adverse Events  
 Adverse events (AEs) will be collected as outlined in Section 6.5 .
 
 
6.4. Effectiveness Assessments  
 
Blinded I magio  results will be transferred to the independent I CC that will review all screening and 
diagnostic imaging conducted including all  Imagio  results  at baseline, prior to any biopsy  (i.e. Month 6) , 
and at  Month 12 if no biopsy is scheduled .  Any imaging studies performed after the Enrollment Visit but 
before the biopsy will also be forwarded to the ICC  for independent reader review.  
 
The histopathology report will be used to establish the diagnosis ; if no biopsy is recommended at the 
Month 12  evaluation , then the Truth Panel will consider all imaging and pathology  findings  to decide if a 
True Negative determination can be made. .  
 6.4.1  Statistical Endpoints  
 
The following statistical metrics  are to be determined for each image set relative to the histopathology 
diagnosis:    
 
1. True-positive rate or sensitivity (Se)  
2. Specificity (Sp)   
3. Concordance (percent true positive [ TP] or true negative [ TN]) 
4. Positive likelihood ratio ( PLR = Se/(1 -Sp)) 
5. Negative likelihood ratio ( NLR = Sp/(1 -Se)) 
6. Predictive values of a negative test (NPV  = TN/(FN+TN) ) 
7. Predictive values of a positive test (PPV  = TP/(FP+TP) ) 
8. Odds ratio (OR  = (TP/FP) / (FN/TN)) .  
 
 
6.5. Safety Assessments 
 
Criteria specified in this section will be used to define, evaluate , and report  subject  safety  during the 
course of their participation in the study .  This NSR study will be conducted under safety reporting 
requirements found in 21 CFR 812.150(a)( 1) and 21 CFR 812.150(b)(1) .

6.5.1  Defining, Recording and Reporting Events  
 
6.5.1.1  Adverse Event (AE )  
 
An AE is defined as any untoward  medical occurrence in a subject . This means any clinically 
adverse sign, symptom, syndrome or illness that occurs or worsens during the course of the 
study, regardless of causality, that is not otherwise being measured in the study.  
 
Each AE will be evaluated for its  seriousness, severit y and association with the Imagio study.   
Adverse events will be followed until resolution or for the duration of the study.  
 
6.5.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE )  
 The se verity of AEs will be assessed according to the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) 14155 -1 SAE definition.  A device -related SAE will be defined as an SAE in 
which the Imagio  device relationship cannot be ruled out.  
 
An AE that meets any of the following criteria will be considered an SAE for protocol purposes : 
 
1. Led to death  
2. Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
 
• Resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury;  
• Resulted in permanent impairment of a body s tructure or a body function;  
• Required in -subject hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization; or,  
• Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
 
• Resulted in persisten t or significant disability or incapacity; or  
• Important AEs that are not immediately life -threatening or do not result in death or 
hospitalization but, based on the training physician’s  medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed 
above.  
 
Neither a biopsy nor a diagnosis of breast cancer is considered to be an adverse event.    
 
 
 
6.5.1.3  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE )  
 
    
 
 
Seno Clinical Study Protocol: PIONEER -01 Confidential

 Page 46 of 80 
  
As defined by FDA regulation at 21 CFR 812.3(s):  
Unanticipated adverse device effect  means any serious  adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, 
or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application  (including a supplementary plan or application),  or any other 
unanticipated serious  problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 
welfare of subjects.  
 
An observer in this study must report any  suspected  UADE to the Seno Medical Director within 24 
hours of learning of the occurrence. Seno will then report any concerned  UADE s, as required by 
FDA regulations .  
 
6.5.2  Evaluation of Severity  
 
The severity of AEs will be assessed according to the following definitions:  
 
Mild: The AE is noticeable to the subject but does not interfere with routine activity . The AE does not 
require any action in connection with the study treatment.  
 Moderate: The AE interferes with routine activity , but responds to symptomatic therapy or rest . The AE 
may require action concerning the study treatment.  
 
Severe:  The AE significantly limits the subject's ability to perform routine activities despite symptomatic 
thera py. The AE may require action concerning the study treatment . 
 
Life-Threatening: The AE is of a nature that  the subject is at immediate risk of death, even if not related 
to the study treatment. The AE may require action concerning the study treatment.  
 6.5.3  Evaluat ion of AE Relationship to Investigational Device  
 
The relationship between an AE and the study device  (investigational device ) will be determined by the 
investigator on the basis of his or her clinical judgment and the following definitions : 
 
  
 
Table 4: Evaluation of AE Relationship to Investigational Device  
Likely related  AEs with clear  temporal and/or spatial relationship to  study  device , with 
no clear alternative underlying cause.  
Probably related  AEs with reasonable  temporal and/or spatial relationship to study device 
that cannot be readily explained by the subject’s clinical state or other 
agents/therapies.  
Possibly related  AEs with fair temporal and/or spatial relationship to study device , with no 
clear alternative underlying cause.

Not related   AEs that do NOT  follow a temporal and/or spatial relationship to study 
device and can be readily explained by an alternative cause, such as an 
accidental injury or expected progression of an underlying or concomi tant 
disease.  
 
 
6.5.4  Reporting of Adverse Events  
 
After the informed consent has been obtained , the investigator, or designee, will determine whether any 
AEs have occurred . Any AEs will be reported in the subject’s medical record and on the AE CRF page, and 
each will be classified according to the aforementioned criteria.  
 
The following categories of adverse events will be entered onto the eCRF:  
1. Any adverse events related to the breast in which the lesion(s) is identified  
2. Any procedure -related adverse events  includ ing adverse events associated with mammography, 
conventional diagnostic ultrasound, Imagio, or biopsy.  
 
Any pre -existing conditions that are detected as part of the Enrollment  procedures must  be reported in

 The investigator, or designee must complete the UADE form and notify the sponsor or sponsor’s authorized representative within 24 hours . The investigator will report all AEs  and UADEs to his/her IRB, 
as per the IRB guidelines.   
 
6.6 Removal of Subjects from the Study  
 
The investigator may withdraw a subject from this stud y to promote subject safety and/or due to 
protocol non -compliance.   
 
6.7 Appropriateness of Measurements  
 
Imagio  was developed to complement and to add additional knowledge to  existing imaging modalities . 
The selected endpoints (sensitivity, specificity , concordance (percent TP and TN), positive likelihood ratio 
(Se/ (1-Sp)), negative likelihood ratio (Sp / (1-Se)), NPV and PPV), and odds ratio give an adequate 
characterization of the I magio  System  in the indication s for use by : 
 
• Decreasing  the number (percent) of women  potentially  undergoing biopsy by identifying those 
unlikely  to have a malignant mass while not increasing the number (percent) of false -negative  to 
a clinically unacceptable level (see N on-Inferiority margin discussion).  
• Showing that Imagio has a sufficiently high  specificity  relative to  the Imagio ultrasound  
component .  
• Showing that Imagio features differentiate between benign and cancer cases.  
• Down classifying BI -RADS 3, 4a, and 4b subjects according to the site investigator.  
• Down classifying BI -RADS 3, 4a, and 4b subjects according to IUS . 
• Up classifying BI -RADS 3, 4a, and 4b subjects according to IUS  
 
7. QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
 
Seno or its designated representatives performs at least monthly quality assurance checks on all 
investigational devices at participating sites . Phantoms and testing protocols will be supplied . The

investigational devices will be delivered and installed by Seno . Seno  will provide guidance on the daily 
operation, back -up, and maintenance of all investigational device s including data transfer.    
 
A Truth Panel will consist of  two independent expert radiologists  and a histopathologist; the Truth Panel 
will work closely with the Sponsor and /or designee to adjudicate all cases and to review anomalies 
relating to pathology, imaging, subject history, and clinical course for th e additional purpose of alerts 
regarding subjects at risk for malignancy, but not biopsied.  
 
• Quality Control and Assurance are conducted by the core imaging lab.  A QA evaluator who is a QA 
radiologist (QAR) (separate from the independent reviewers) will perform an image/lesion pairing 
assessment once the ICC  performs the QA of all demographic  data, checks  image completeness and 
quality , and resolves all discrepancies.  The ICC  must perform this QA befor e the independent review 
can take place. The QARs will also check if lesions scanned with Imagio at the site match the same 
lesion(s) seen on all imaging modalities at the site.  The QA Radiologists review and select the 
relevant images and videos to allow  unbiased and least burdensome IR review and ensure the 
imaging data can be read consistently, without ambiguity.  In addition, criteria are in place to identify 
unbiopsied cases with a risk of malignancy according to the independent registration readers.    
 
For the Pivotal Study component, subsets of 5% of registration image sets and 2.5% of all reimbursement image sets will be reread to assess learning and consistency.  
 
 In addition, Seno  or its designated representatives will monitor all clinical studie s that it sponsors . Before 
the enrollment of subject s in this study, the sponsor or sponsor’s authorized representative and the 
investigator will review the protocol, the eCRF and instructions for completing them, the procedure for 
obtaining informed consent and the procedure for reporting AEs/ UADEs/ SAEs . Site monitoring visits will 
be performed by the sponsor or sponsor’s authorized representatives on a regular basis . During these 
visits, information recorded in the eCRFs will be verified against source documents . The eCRF will be 
reviewed for device perform ance and compliance issues, safety information, legibility, completeness, 
accuracy and logical consistency . The data will reside in an electronic database . Additional computer 
programs that identify selected protocol violations, out -of-range data and other  data errors may be used 
to help monitor the study . As necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to the 
investigator. 
 
 
Independent auditors from the sponsor or sponsor’s authorized representative will be allowed by the 
investigator to audit previously monitored data . In addition, audits may be conducted by appropriate 
regulatory authorities.  
 
Data entered in the eCRF will be source verified for accuracy and completeness . In addition, protocol 
compliance and compliance with FDA and E U regulations, including GCP, ICH , and ISO  requirements , will 
be verified.

8. STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
8.1 General Considerations  
 
8.1.1  Statistical Strategy  
 
This is a MRMC design involving two image sets (Imagio and its’ ultrasound component) for registration 
(according to 7 independent readers) and multiple combinations of image sets for reimbursement 
(according to 3 other independent readers) .  The registration readers will review all cases while the 
reimbursement readers will read multiple  combinations of image sets .  The PMA filing will be based on 
the registration results with the reimbursement results to be submitted  at a later date.    
 A total of at least  1700 women at 16  US sites are planned to undergo an I magio  evaluation  following 
prospective enrollment , provided there are a sufficient number of benign  masses (at least 1,000 masses)  
and, if there is not a sufficient number , then the total number of  subjects will increase to achieve at least 
1,000  benign  masses. Subjects  with a n undiagnosed  suspicious finding within the previous 45 business 
days, by palpation or by a screening or diagnostic methodology other than ultrasound , and scheduled to 
undergo a conventional diagnostic ultrasound will be prospectively screened . Subjects with only a BI-
RADS 1  or BI -RADS 2 classification will be regarded as screen failures.  This strategy reduces referral bias 
and accounts for a consecutive  series  of BI -RADS 3  and BI RADS 4  cases  not discovered according to CDU.  
Once a decision has been made to biopsy (yes or no), the subject  will then undergo an Imagio  evaluation  
of all masses to be biopsied (up to a total of three per subject from both breasts) .  The I magio  results will 
not be used to decide whether or where to biopsy or to reverse the decision to biopsy; also no study -
related follow -up is planned after the biops y. 
 
 The analyses will be performed at the mass level since some subjects will have more than one mass biopsied.   It is expected that no more than 5% of all subjects will have multiple masses so no repeated 
measures analyses are planned , that is, all lesions will be treate d as independent observations . 
 Subjects will be drawn from the following four  subpopulations selected by the site investigator to  
undergo diagnostic ultrasound  and then Imagio : 
 
• Callbacks for additional evaluation of suspicious area( s) identified by imaging other than 
ultrasound.  
• Diagnostic referral to assess focal physical symptoms and / or signs that were either a chief 
complaint of the subject or were elicited by the healthcare practitioner  (excluding focal breast 
pain in the absence of other positive clinical findings) . 
• Interval Clinical Problems (symptoms or physical findings excluding isolated focal breast pain, that 
have  developed between  yearly mammograms) . 
• Other referrals to diagnostic conventional ultrasound  including subjects  younger than 30 years 
old for a clinically suspicious area, or subjects  referred from a screening MRI because of an

abnormality . 
 
These subpopulations will be analyzed in aggregate as well as individually.   
 The Imagio diagnostic ultrasound  component will serve as the “internal control” .   
 The specificity determined by a 2% POM is the primary effectiveness endpoint while the sensitivity is  the 
secondary effectiveness endpoint.    
 Multiple effectiveness endpoints will be assessed (one primary  and four secondary) so the overall 5% 
Type I error will be controlled by requiring two -sided p=0.01 to establish statistical significance.     
Specificity will be tested first according to a superiority test while sensitivity will then be tested according 
to non -inferiority tests .  Testing will be based  on the specificity  (primary endpoint)  and sensitivity  
(secondary endpoint) , both based on a 2% Probability of Malignancy (POM) .  The overall specificity 
exceeding 40% will also be tested.  In addition, downgrading benign masses and upgrading malignant 
masses  using Imagio relative to the site and  relative to IUS will be evaluated.  
 The superiority test and the non -inferiority  tests will each  have at least 80% power to  test their re spective 
hypothes es according to a two-sided test with overall 1% Type I error.  The histo patho logy findings of the 
biopsy procedure will serve as a gold standard for I magio .  The decision to not recommend a biopsy 
during the first 12 months together with a negative 12 month clinical and imaging follow -up and no 
evidence of a >20% increase in the mass will be regarded as evidence of  no disease (True -Negative for a 
negative OA/FN for a positive screening OA ) for those initially not recommended  for biops y.  
 
A total of 7  independent radiologists will be assigned per each case to independently evaluate both image 
sets (IUS and Imagio) per subject .  In addition, 3 other independent readers will perform the 
reimbursement reads .  All independent r eaders will evaluate all Pivotal Study cases ; the readers  will also 
review 5% of all cases to assess temporal trends and consistency ; the initial evaluation will be used in all 
analyses .  
 
Each registration reader will review the data from the two image sets  (IUS, Imagio ) for each case; each 
reader will evaluate Imagio according to a pre -determined diagnostic rule set based on OA image 
characteristics  and will similarly evaluate IUS according to another pre -determined diagnostic rule set and 
each  reader will estimate the probability that the mass is  cancer on a scale from 0% to 100% in 5% 
increments (1% if ≤ 10% or > 90% ).   Readers will assess IUS  and Imagio  in this pre -defined order during 
independent review sessions ; this pre -defined order is  consistent with medical practice.  
 
Registration readers will also have access to the results of two locked nomograms to separately predict 
the POM and the probability of cancer.  These nomograms were constructed from the Pilot Study cases  
using a linear m odel for the POM and a logistic regression model for the probability of cancer.  The 
nomograms are constructed from the five  feature scores for Imagio from a blinded review performed by 
Dr. Stavros.  The registration readers do not need to use the results of the nomograms in making their POM judgments, but they will immediately see the two predictions as soon as they score the five

features.  The sensitivity and specificity of the nomograms will also be evaluated using the average 
predicted score; if the av erage is ≤0.1, then the case is predicted to be benign.    
 The final sample size of the Pivotal Study will be determined by an interim analysis after the first 80 0 
Pivotal Study  subjects (cases 101 -900 passing Quality Assurance review) have been evaluated with Imagio 
plus the results of any pre -scheduled biopsies ; the final sample size will depend on the  numbers of 
masses biopsied, the percent of biopsied masses with a cancer diagnosis, and the sensitivities and 
specificities for Imagio and IUS among biopsied masses .  The interim analysis will be conducted once at 
least four of the seven registration readers complete the review of the 800 cases.  Results will be shared 
with partners for business planning purposes based on all 7 registrati on readers but will not be shared 
with sites or published until the study is completed.  The final sample size will not exceed 2,400 masses .  
 The study design will require all images to be managed  by an independent  ICC according to  FDA 
guidelines  (FDA Clinical Performance Evaluation : Considerations for Computer- Assisted Detection Devices 
Applied to Radiology Images and Radiology Device Data –  Pre-market Approval [PMA] and Pre -market 
Notification [510k] Submissions, October 21, 2009 ).  The ICC will assign multiple readers per team to  
review all images leading to the decision to either perform a biopsy or to follow the subject for up to 12 
months.  To best replicate clinical relevance where mammography and conventional diagnostic 
ultrasound will be read first in practice, the image sets will be read in the following order:  
 
1. Imagio diagnostic ultrasound  alone  
2. Imagio ( diagnostic ultrasound  plus opto -acoustics).  
 
To preserve their independence and objectivity as well as to minimize bias, the independent readers  must 
lock their IUS evaluations before being allowed to begin their Imagio evaluations; in addition , readers will 
NOT have access to any clinical data but will have access to  biopsy outcomes  once  they record and lock 
their evaluations.  Then reader s will have controlled access to biopsy outcomes in units of 25 cases to 
simulate the real world setting where practicing radiologists receive outcomes . 
 
Variable referral patterns across sites are expected.  The referral pattern also varies depending on study 
site (academic vs. private practice) , age, risk factors  (family history of breast cancer, obesity ), and breast  
BI-RADS density . Note that pre- screening and referral patterns influence diagnostic performance, helping 
to explain a breast cancer detection rate (BCDR) ranging between 18% and 40%.  Endpoints of family 
history of breast cancer and obesity were not collected in this study.  
 
The histologic findings of the biopsy procedure will serve as a gold standard for Imagio and the decision to not recommend a biopsy during the first 12 months will be regarded as evidence no  of disease (True -
Negative) for those not recommended for biopsy.  Images will be assessed according to if the biopsy was 
performed immediately, delayed, or irrespective of timing  through the 12 month follow -up interval.   
 
High risk histologies will be analyzed separately from benign and malignant histologies in all dat a 
analyses.   This reflects current practices where high risk masses are considered to be benign histologies 
but are always removed.

In general, s uperiority will be assessed using a two-sided 9 9% lower bound > 0 while  non-inferiority  will be 
assessed using  a one -sided 9 9.5% lower bound greater than or equal to the non -inferiority margin .  
 
8.2 Study Hypotheses  
 
The above considerations motivate multiple hypotheses . As pre -specified below, Hypothesis 1 tests 
Imagio specificity superiority versus IUS (H1) while Hypothesis 2 tests Imagio sensitivity non -inferiority 
versus IUS (H2).  Hypothes es 3 and 4  test if the stand alone Imagio s pecificity  is at least 40 % (H3) and the 
stand alone sen sitivi ty is at least 9 0% (H 4).  Hypothesis 5 tests the hypotheses for using Imagio to 
downgrade benign masses to BI -RADS 2 and 3 from BI -RADS 3, 4a, and 4b using IUS  (H5) and upgrade 
malignant masses relative to IUS  (H6).   
    
 
The study hypotheses are as follows:  
 8.2.1.  Hypothesis 1 : The Imagio specificity is superior to IUS specificity  
Null hypothesis) Ho:  Imagio specificity –  IUS specificity < 0%  
versus    
Alternative hypothesis) Ha: Imagio specificity –  IUS specificity > 0%  
A 6% absolute advantage in specificity is regarded as being the minimum meaningful advantage to help 
spare biopsies .  Specificity superiority will be tested against the null hypothesis of no difference.  
 
8.2.2.  Hypothesis 2 : The Imagio  sensitivity is non -inferior to IUS  
 
Null hypothesis) H
o:  Imagio sensitivity  – IUS sensitivity ≤ - 5% 
 
versus    
 
Alternative hypothesis) H a: Imagio sensitivity  – IUS sensitivity > - 5% 
 Sensitivities are expected to be at least 95% for both Imagio and IUS.  A  5% sensitivi ty non -inferiority 
margin is regarded as being clinically meaningful.  
  
8.2.3. Hypothesis 3:  Imagio  has acceptable stand -alone specificity  
Null hypothesis) H o:  Specificity = 40%  
versus  
Alternative hypothesis) H a: Specificity > 40%

300176 Rev  8  PIONEER 01 Protocol Amendment 3.2   
Eff. Date: October 15, 2015 
 Page 54 of 80 
  
A stand -alone specificity exceeding 40%  is regarded as being clinically meaningful.  
 
8.2.4. Hypothesis 4:  Imagio  has acceptable stand -alone sensitivity  
 Null hypothesis) H
o:  Sensitivity = 90% 
 versus     
 
Alternative hypothesis) H
a: Sensitivity > 90% 
 
A stand -alone sensitivity exceeding 95 % is regarded as being clinically meaningful.  
 
8.2.5. Hypothesis 5:  Imagio  evaluation improves the overall diagnostic efficiency for benign masses as  
measured by the relative risk  in the BI -RADS  3 and BI RADS 4a and BI RADS 4 b subgroup s according to IUS .  
A reduction of BI -RADS 4a  and BI-RADS 4b according to IUS to BI -RADS 2 or 3 according to Imagio would 
be a major advance  as would a reduction of BI -RADS 3 according to IUS to BI -RADS 1  or 2 according to 
Imagio .  Specifically, the cancer prevalence ranges from 2% to 10% for the BI -RADS 4a category  and 11% 
to 50% for the BI -RADS 4b category so  a reduction to 1% or 2% would be equivalent to BI -RADS 2 or 3 
which would be sufficient to prevent negative biopsies  and t o delay interval follow -up.  A similar benefit 
would be to reduce cancer prevalence from 2% to <2% for the BI -RADS 3 subgroup.  
 
Null hypothesis) H o:  No difference in BI -RADS according to Imagio  vs. IUS  
 
versus   
 Alternative hypothesis) H
a:  Decreased BI-RADS according to Imagio  vs. IUS  
 A 25%  reduction  to BI -RADS 2/3 from BI -RADS 3/4a/4b is regarded as being clinically meaningful for 
benign masses . 
 
8.2.6.  Hypothesis 6 :  Imagio evaluation improves the overall diagnostic efficiency for malignant  masses 
as measured by the relative risk in the BI -RADS subgroups according to IUS .  An increase in BI-RADS 
according to IUS to higher BI-RADS according to Imagio would be a major advance.    
 Null hypothesis) H
o:  No difference  BI-RADS according to Imagio  vs. IUS  
 
versus  
 Alternative hypothesis) H
a:  Increased BI -RADS according to Imagio  vs. IUS  
 A 10% increase  in BI -RADS 3/4a/4b/4c to higher BI -RADS 4c/5 is regarded as being clinically meaningful 
for malignant masses.  
 
8.3. Analysis Populations

All analyses will be performed with  the intention to diagnose (ITD) study population which consists of all 
subjects coming in for their scheduled I magio  evaluation , having Imagio data declared evaluable,  and 
having a biopsy at 12 months, or declared to be TN (or FP) at 12months.  
 
 There will be Truth Panel review to identify mass -specific subgroups and TN outcomes as well as reader-
specific exclusions for the following : 
 
1. Cases with QAR concerns (including cases with previously unidentified suspicious masses and 
cases where the Imagio evaluation was incomplete, unreliable, or unusable) for exclusions   
2. Cases where the number or numbering of suspicious masses is under dispute  (per QARs or IRs) 
for exclusions  
3. Cases with questionable eligibility  for exclusions  
4. Cases with high risk histologies  for separate analyses  
5. Cases where individual IRs identified problems with specific image sets  for exclusions  
6. Cases with NDUs to determine if a mass was a True -Negative (TN)  for specificity calculations.  
 
 
8.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
 
The age, race, ethnicity , menopausal status , breast density, and BI -RADS score  will be presented using 
descriptive statistics for the overall ITD population , by study population type, by sites  (individual, private 
practice, academic) , by biopsy status  (immediate, delayed, never) , and by cancer status  (benign, high risk , 
malignant) .  
 
 
8.5. Analysis Definitions   
 
The final data for diagnostic test sensitivity  and specificity will be presented in terms of a 2 × 2 table as 
follows ; the threshold for defining a positive  POM will be 2% corresponding to clinical practice standards : 
 
Table 5: 2 x 2 Table   
 Cancer  Benign  
Test  + True Positive ( TP) False Positive ( FP) 
Test  - False Negative ( FN) True Negative ( TN) 
 
The above 2x2 table will also be constructed separately for Imagio  and the Imagio diagnostic ultrasound 
component  relative to a cancer or benign diagnosis. In addition, these 2x2 tables will also be generated 
for immediate biopsies, for delayed biopsies, for all biopsies, and for all cases including those not 
biopsied ; discordant pairs for sensitivity a s well as  spec ificity will be analyzed .   Those subject s without a 
biopsy will be excluded if they were not followed without a subsequent clinical evaluation.

300176 Rev  8  PIONEER 01 Protocol Amendment 3.2   
Eff. Date: October 15, 2015 
 Page 56 of 80 
  
A subject will be assigned to a row in the table depending on the respective diagnostic test result . 
Subject s with a diagnosis ( biopsy or 11 month follow -up with no biopsy)  will be assigned a column in the 
table according to the following rules:  
 
1. If the result of the biopsy results in a cancer diagnosis, then the subject will be assigned to the 
Cancer colu mn.  
2. If the result of the biopsy results in a benign diagnosis, then the subject will be assigned to the Benign column.  
3. If the biopsy was not performed  and the  subject  was evaluated af ter 11 months post -baseline  
(nominal 12 month evaluation) , then the subject will be counted as TN  as long as there were no 
contrary clinical or radiologic findings (not to be based on Imagio) ; any mass declared to have any 
contrary clinical or radiologic findings will be declared to be a False -Positive  if the Im agio POM 
was <2%; otherwise the subject will not be included in the table  
4. If the baseline Imagio  evaluation was not performed  or declared to not be useable , then the 
subject will not be included in the table.  
 
In addition, the cancer group will be further divided into invasive carcinoma and DCIS categories and each 
of these two categories will be assessed separately within a 2x2 t able .  
 The use of the terms sensitivity and specificity is justified in this study because the  biopsy  and 1 1 month  
evaluation (12 month nominal evaluation)  is the gold standard . The following statistical endpoints will be  
assessed  for each image set : 
 
• The true positive rate  (TPR) or sensitivity  of the test is defined as TP/ (TP + FN)  
• The specificity of the test is defined as TN/ (TN + FP)  
• The concordance  of the test is defined as (TP + TN) /N  
• The positive likelihood ratio  is defined as TPR/FPR  
• The negative likelihood ratio is defined as (1 –  TPR)/(1 – FPR) 
• The positive predictive value (PPV)  is defin ed as  TP/ (TP + FP)  
• The negative predictive value  (NPV) is defined as TN/ (TN + FN)  
• The odds ratio  (OR) is defined as (TP/FP)/(FN/TN)    
 Given that biopsy decisions are made using the 2% POM, POM levels > 2% have limited relevance  to the 
2% threshold now widely used for making biopsy decisions . 
 
8.6.  Sample Size Calculation s 
The sample size calcu lations for the P ivotal Study may be increased based  on the  n=800 interim analysis 
results.  The Pilot Study results will solely be used to validate the algorithm  and will not count towards the  
Pivotal Study sample size.  
 The interim analysis will provide key information to  check  the preliminary assumptions regarding  
the degree of correlation s between Imagio  and IUS. Imagio can theoretically succe ed with 
improve ments relative to the above two  diagnostic gray scale citations ( 25, 26) with success

optimized if Imagio can  rule out suspicious benign cases (minimizing the false -positive  percents).  
The following table summa rizes the specificity supe riority tests to detect a conservative absolute

 8.6.1  Sample Size Re -estimation  
The sensitivity and specificity need to be estimated in an unbiased manner  using the most accurate 
assumptions . This will be accomplished using an interim analysis after the first 8 00 subjects  are evaluated 
by the independent readers; specific attention will be paid to the “internal control. ”  The specificity will 
be the primary effectiveness endpoint and the sensitivity will be the secondary effectiveness endpoint for 
this sample size recalculation; the sample size will not be decreased under any circumstances. The final sample size of the Pivotal Study will be determined by an interim analysis after the first 800  subjects have 
been evaluated with Imagio  relative to  the results of any pre -sched uled biopsies ; the final sample  size will 
depend on the numbers of masses biopsied, the percent of biopsied masses with a cancer diagnosis, and the sensitivities and specificities for Imagio and IUS . The interim analysis will be conducted once at least 
four of the seven registration readers complete the review of the 800 cases.   The final sample size will 
not exceed 2,400 masses.   
 
To preserve the Type I error, the observed specificity difference s will not be used in the sample size re -
estimation and there will not be an interim stopping rule for the study.    
 
8.7. Analyses  
 
8.7.1  Sensitivity and Specificity  
 
The specificity for Imagio relative to  the Imagio ultrasound component (IUS) will be assessed using a one-
sided 9 9.5% lower confidence bound.  The goal is to  establish at least  a 6% absolute advantage in  
specificity  for Imagio vs IUS .

The sensitivities and specificities will be displayed for Imagio relative to IUS; in these displays, the 
consequences of Imagio (positive vs. negative) will be co nsidered and compared using a generalized 
linear model (GENMOD) to account for correlated outcomes among the readers. . 
Additional analyses will be performed using the nomograms for the POM and the diagnosis based on the 
five Imagio features.  The first nomogram models the probability of malignancy (NPP) while the second 
nomogram models the probability of cancer (NPC).  The sensitivity and specificity of the averaged prediction (NPP and N PC) being >0.1 or ≤0.1 will be evaluated.  The ability of the nomogram to 
downgrade benign masses with IUS POM <30% and CDU POM < 30% will also be assessed.  The linear 
regression (NPP) and the logistic regression (NPC) models behind the predictions are bas ed solely upon 
the Pilot Study data.  
 
8.7.2 Histologic Considerations  
 
The nature of the malignancies will be analyzed.  While DCIS is considered malignant, many of the vascular and metabolic changes that might be detectable  with OA may be limited to invasive carcinoma. 
Thus, the degree of i nvasive malignant and non -invasive (DCIS) malignant mass es will be analyzed 
separately. It may be that OA is very effective in detecting invasive malignancy, but not as effective at 
detecting DCIS.  The malignant potential becomes a consideration with OA risk benefit if it performed 
better for more invasive and more extensive malignancies, while a missed DCIS carries reduced ris k.  
Other lower risk mass es would include atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular 
carcinoma in situ, and lobular neoplasia which will be considered benign for the purposes of this study.  
 High risk mass es will also be considered from the perspective of where to distingui sh between benign and 
malignant disease .  Specifically, h istopathologic diagnoses of atypical ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular 
neoplasia, and lobular carcinoma in situ, etc. are considered “in between” benign and malignant.  These 
cases will be conside red high risk  as confirmed by the central pathologist .   Since the features of high risk 
mass es are nonspecific , usually reflect ing the features of the underlying benign mass  in which they arose, 
including such mass es in the malignant category would reduce sensitivity.  As a practical matter, such 
diagnoses are almost always require re -biopsy , e.g. a surgical excision, which often results in an upgrade 
to DCIS or invasive cancer. This information will be collected and  included in the malignant category if so 
classified by the independent pathologist  who will make the final determination .  However, some cases, 
even after excision, may remain high risk  so high risk masses will always be analyzed separately .
 
8.7.3 Feature  Analysis  
  
Additional analyses will be performed using the specific features from the Pivotal Study to discriminate benign from cancer using classification methodology.   Six specific pre -defined OA features w ill be scored  
by the independent readers using a 0-5 or 0 -6 ordinal scale  to evaluate : 1) internal vascularity and de -
oxygenation, 2)   internal deoxygenated blush , 3) internal total blood  4) peri-tumoral boundary zone 
vascularity and deoxygenation,), 5) external peri- tumoral radiating vessels, and 6)  interfering artifact. The 
first three features are considered to be internal features and will also be summed to derive a total internal feature score.  Similarly, the fourth and fifth feature will be summed to derive a total external feature score.  Also  the five feature scores will also be summed to derive a total score.   The distributions

of the benign vs. malignant masses will be performed using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for individual 
features and ANOVA  for the three total scores .    
 
8.7.4    Other Secondary Analyses  
The sensitivity, specificity, concordance, PPV, NPV, PLR, NLR, and odds ratio  for Imagio  and the Imagio 
ultrasound component will be displayed for 2% POM and assessed using 9 9% confidence bounds.    
 Additionally, sensitivity  and specificity results will be separately displayed for Imagio  and the Imagio 
ultrasound component for  the pre -defined subpopulations  as descriptive statistics.   
 8.7.5  BI-RADS Analyses
 
Results will be displayed according to the BI -RADS classification to provide insight into currently used 
guidelines.  The matched pairs cross tabulation  of Imagio versus  its’ ultrasound component will be  
assessed .     
The ability of Imagio to downgrade BI -RADS 4a  and 4 b (or BI-RADS 3) relative to IUS and separately 
according to the site investigator  to BI -RADS 3 (or BI-RADS 1 -2) for the benign cases and to then 
symmetrically upgrade BI -RADS 3 , 4a, 4b, and 4c  according to Imagio relative to IUS and separately 
relative  to the site investigator  for the cancer cases; the discordant pairs will be compared using a 
McNemar’s test  for individual readers and a generalized linear model for grouping readers.   In addition,  
the ability of Imagio to improve the site investigator classification for the BI -RADS 4ab ( or BI-RADS 3) 
subgroup will be assessed separately for the cancer and benign cases; the percents (Imagio positive vs. 
Imagio negative) will be separately evaluated using a two -sided Fisher Exact Test.   
 
8.7.6  Histopathology Analyses  
Results for cancers, benign cases, and high risk cases will be separately displayed to see if Imagio features are correlated with histopathology outcomes.  
 
8.7.7 Other Analyses  
 The sensitivity  and specificity  for Imagio  and the Imagio ultrasound component will be generated for 
individual readers.  The learning curve of individual readers will also be assessed in units of at least 100 
cancers and at least 200 benigns to check if sensitivities and specificities improve as more  cases are read.  
 Inter -reader variation will be evaluated separately for cancer cases and for benign cases for the reader s.  
Inter -reader variability for these two subsets (cancers, benigns) will be analyzed using an ANOVA  model 
where the readers are cons idered to be fixed effects; a random effects model will also be run.   Intra -
reader variation will be evaluated using paired t -tests applied to the paired POMs , and BI -RADS separately 
for cancer cases and for benign cases.

Clinical Features   
The basic dermatosis may be mildly or severely exacerbated by UVR exposure, usually within minutes to 
hours. With sunlight avoidance, mass es gradually improve over a period of days to weeks. The UVR -
exacerbated eruption may be limited to sites characteristic of the underlying condition, or, less 
commonly, involve all sun -exposed sites. Photo -testing results are often normal, except in subjects  with 
LE. Occasionally, broad -spectrum irradiation may evoke the eruption.

Patholog y  
The histology is that of the underlying dermatosis . 
Differential Diagnosis   
In general, photo -aggravated dermatoses are recognized by the presence of the underlying skin disease . 
Differentiation from PMLE  (polymorphous light eruption)  by history alone may be difficult.   Clinically, 
the latter is typically papular and pruritic, has negative lupus serology, and is often characterized by 
abnormal photo -provocation tests. It is important to note that PMLE may coexist with other 
dermatoses,  in particular with photosensitive psoriasis. Photo -aggravated atopic dermatitis, if 
widespread, may be confused with CAD; however, the latter subjects  have markedly positive photo -test 
results. It is also important to distinguish UVR exacerbation of dermatoses from aggravation due to heat.  
Treatment   
Treatment consists primarily of topical or systemic therapy aimed at the underlying disorder. If 
significant photosensitivity persists, low -dose broad - or narrowband UVB or PUVA therapy (as for PMLE) 
may on oc casion be effective. However, the latter is contraindicated in subjects  with LE or 
dermatomyositis, because systemic exacerbation may conceivably occur. Photo -protection is also 
important.  
Chemical - and Drug -Induced Photo -sensitivity  
 
Key Features  
• Phototoxicity is characterized by an exaggerated sunburn reaction and is usually caused by systemic agents  
• Photoallergy presents with eczematous mass es and is most commonly associated with topical 
photoallergens  
• The cutaneous porphyrias are an example of phototoxicity induced by endogenous agents  
• Management consists of identification and avoidance of the offending agent

History   
Phototoxic agents have been used as medications from as early as 4000  BC, with the inhabitants of 
Mesopotamia (and later the Indians and Egyptians) employing plant -derived psoralens for the treatment 
of leukoderma. In 1913, hematoporphyrin -induced photo -toxicity was demonstrated by Meyer -Betz, 
while the current method of PUVA therapy was introduced in the 1970s. Photo -allergy was first 
recognized in 1939 based on a classic study by Epstein on sulfanilamide.  
Epidemiology  
While the exact prevalence  of photo -toxicity and photo -allergy in the general population is unknown, 
their frequency in photo -dermatology referral centers has ranged from 7% to 15% for photo -toxicity and 
from 4% to 8% for photo -allergy .  
Pathogenesis   
The pathogenesis of phototoxicity involves the generation of oxygen  free radicals, superoxide anions, 
hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen, which leads to a host of cytotoxic effects. Other mechanisms of 
tissue damage include the generation of stable photoproducts (reported with chlorpromazine and 
tetracyclines), the form ation of photoadducts (reported with psoralens), and the generation of 
inflammatory mediators (reported with porphyrins and demethylchlortetracycline) . 
The pathogenesis of photoallergy is identical to that of allergic contact dermatitis, with the exception  of 
the requirement for the presence of UVR to induce photoallergen formation.  
Clinical Features   
 
Photo -toxicity   
Following cutaneous or systemic exposure to a phototoxic agent and appropriate UVR, phototoxicity 
develops within hours; for the vast majority of such agents, the action spectrum is in the UVA range. 
Erythema and edema as well as burning and stinging sensations characterize the initial presentation, 
with vesicles and bul lae seen in severely affected subjects . Phototoxic reactions due to oral medications 
resemble exaggerated  sunburn. These reactions resolve spontaneously with desquamation and 
hyperpigmentation.  
Other less common manifestations of phototoxicity include pseu doporphyria (frequently caused by non -
steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], especially naproxen), photo -onycholysis (reported with 
tetracyclines and psoralens), slate -gray hyperpigmentation (reported with amiodarone, tricyclic 
antidepressants and dil tiazem) , and lichenoid eruptions (seen with quinine and quinidine). Evolution of 
phototoxicity reactions into chronic actinic dermatitis (see above) has rarely been reported following 
exposure to thiazides, quinidine, quinine or simvastatin. The medication s most commonly associated 
with phototoxicity are listed in Table 86.5 .

5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), methotrexate and retinoids, three commonly used medications in dermatology, 
have been associated with ‘photosensitivity’; however, none is associated with UVR -induced activation 
of the drug. UV -exacerbated erythema in subjects  receiving 5 -FU usuall y occurs in sites with actinic 
keratoses. While no systematic photo -testing study has been performed in subjects  taking 5 -FU, this 
reaction most likely represents an exacerbation of 5 -FU-induced cutaneous inflammation by UVR. 
Administration of methotrexate  is known to occasionally cause a recurrence of UV -induced erythema. 
Photo -testing in subjects  taking methotrexate has been normal, and the mechanism for the ‘recall 
erythema’ reaction remains unclear. Photo -testing in subjects  taking isotretinoin or etret inate is also 
usually a routine practice . The propensity for these subjects to develop UV -induced erythema is most 
likely due to retinoid -induced thinning of the stratum corneum.  
Phytophotodermatitis is characterized by linear streaks of erythema that occu r a day or so after contact 
with plants (frequently furocoumarin -containing) plus exposure to sunlight. Linear post -inflammatory 
hyperpigmentation is a classic finding. Plants capable of inducing phytophotodermatitis include yarrow, 
parsley, celery, parsnips, milfoil, lime, lemon and fig. Therefore, this condition most commonly occurs in 
individuals whose outdoor activities expose them to such plants (e.g. vegetable harvesters, bartenders).  
Roofers and road workers may occasionally develop phototoxicity sec ondary to exposure to tar plus 
UVA from sunlight. St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum ), a product widely available in health food 
stores that is used to treat minor cuts, diarrhea, fever and depression, contains hypericin, a known 
phototoxic agent.  
Photo -allergy   
In previously sensitized individuals, exposure to photo -allergens plus sunlight results in the development 
of a pruritic eczematous eruption. In more severely affected subjects , vesicles and bullae may develop 
(but less commonly than in phot otoxic reaction). While there are clear differences between the clinical 
manifestations of photo -toxicity versus photo -allergy, such differences may not always be obvious, and 
careful history taking and examination are essential.  
Currently, in the US, UK and France, sunscreen agents (especially benzophenone -3) are the most 
common cause of photo -allergy, while NSAIDs are the leading photo -allergen in Germany, Austria, and 
Switzerland.  Other common photo -allergens include fragrances and anti- bacterial produc ts.

Appendix B: ACR Guidelines  
The American  College  of Radiol ogy, with more than 30,000  members, is the principal  organization of  radiol ogists, radiation  oncologists, and 
clinical medical  physicists  in the United  States. The College  is a nonprofit professional society  whose  primary purposes  are to advance the 
science  of radiolog y, improve radiologic  services to the pa tient, study  the soc ioecon omic aspects  of the practice of radiology , and en courage  
contin uing education  for radi ologists, radiation  oncolog ists, medical  physicists, and persons  practicing  in allied  professional  fields. 
The American College  of Radiology  will periodical ly define new practice  guidelines  and technical  standards  for radiologic  practi ce to help  
advance  the science  of radiology  and to improve  the quality  of service to patients  throughout the United  States.  Existing  practice  guidelines  and 
technical  standards will be  reviewed  for revision  or renewal,  as appropriat e, on their fifth annivers ary or sooner,  if indicated. 
Each  practice  guideline and tec hnical  standar d, representing  a policy statement by the Colle ge, has u ndergone  a thoro ugh consensus process  in 
which it has  been subjected  to extensive review, requiring  the approval  of the Commission  on Quality  and Safety  as well as  the ACR Board  of 
Chancellors,  the ACR Council  Steering  Committee, and the ACR  Council.  The practice  guidel ines and technical  standards  recogni ze that the 
safe and effective  use of diagnostic and  therapeutic  radiology  requires  specific  training,  skills,  and techniques,  as described  in each document.

ACR PRACTICE  GUIDELINE  FOR THE PERFORMANCE  OF A 
BREA ST ULTRA SOUND EXAMI NATION  
 
 
PREAMBLE  
 
These gu idelin es are an educational tool d esign ed to assist practition ers in providing ap propriate ra diation oncology 
care for patients. They are not inflexible rules or require ments of practice and are not intended, nor should they be 
used, to establish  a legal  standa rd of care.  For these  reasons and those  set forth below,  the American College of  
Radiology cautions against the use o f these guidelines in litigation in which the clinical decisio ns of a practition er are 
called  into question . 
 
The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure or course of action must be made by the 
physician  or medical physicist in light of all the circu mstances  presented. Thus, an approach that differs from the  
guidelines,  standing  alone, does not neces sarily i mply that the approa ch was below  the stand ard of care. To  the 
contrary, a conscientious practition er may res ponsibly adopt a course of actio n different from that set  forth in the 
guidelines when, in the reasonable judgment of the practition er, such course  of action  is indicated  by the condition of 
the patient, limitation s of available  resources, or  advances in knowled ge or technology subsequent to publicatio n of 
the guidelines. Howe ver, a practition er who employs an approach s ubstantially  differe nt from these g uidelines is 
advised to document in the patient record infor mation sufficie nt to explain t he approach taken. 
 
The practice of medicine  involves  not only the science, but also the art of dealing  with the prev ention, diagnosis, 
alleviation, and treat ment of disease. Th e variety and co mplexity of h uman conditions  make it impossible  to always  
reach the most appropr iate diagnosis  or to predict with c ertainty a p articular  response to trea tment.  
 
Therefore, it s hould be reco gnized that adh erence to th ese gui delines  will not assure an  accurate diagnosis  or a 
succes sful outcome. All that sho uld be expected is that the practition er  will  follow  a  reaso nable  course  of  
action based on current knowledge, available res ources, and the needs of the patie nt to deliver effective  and safe 
medical care.  The sole purpose  of these guidelines is to assist practition ers in achieving this objective.

I.           INTRODUCTION  
 
This guideline has been developed to assist  practitio ners performing ultrasound examination of the breast. When 
ultrasou nd is used as guidance for interventional procedures or bi opsy, relevant ACR g uidelines should be 
consulted. 
 
II.          INDICATI ONS 
 
Appropriate indications  for breast sonography  include , but are not limited to: 
 
1. Evaluation    and   characte rization   of   palpable masses and other breast r elated signs and/or symptoms [1-4]. 
2. Evaluation       of      suspected      or      apparent ab normalities detected on o ther imaging studies, su ch as 
mammography or magne tic resonance imaging (MRI) [5]. 
3. Initial imaging evaluation of palpable masses  in wo men under 30 years of age who are not at  high risk  for 
deve lopment of breast  cancer,  and in lactating and pregnant women. 
4. Evaluation of  problems associated  with breast  implants [6]. 
5.Eva luation  of  breasts  with  microcal cificatio ns and /or architectural  distortion suspicious for malignancy  or 
highly suggestive of malignancy in a setting  of dense fibroglandular tissue, for detecting an underlying mass that 
may be obs cured on the mammogram  [6]. 
6. Guidance      of     breast     biopsy     and     other interventional procedures [7]. 
7. Treat ment pla nning for radiatio n therapy [6]. 
8.As a supplement to mammography, screening for occult  cancers in certain  popu lations of women (suc h as those 
with dense  fibroglandular breasts who  are also at elevated  risk of breast  cancer or with  newly suspected brea st 
cancer)  who are not cand idates for MRI [8-9] or have no  easy access to  MRI.  
9. Identification  and biopsy guidance of abnormal 
axillary ly mph node(s), f or example in p atients with newly diagnosed or rec urrent breast ca ncer [ 10-11] or with 
findings h ighly suggestive of mali gnancy or other significant etio logy. 
 
III. QUALIF ICATIONS  AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF T HE PHYSICIAN  
 
A.   Physician  
 
Physicians who supervise, perform, and/or interpret breast ultras ound examinations s hould be licens ed medical 
practition ers who  have a thorough understanding of the indicatio ns for ultrasound e xaminations as well as a 
familiarity  with the basic physical principles and l imitations  of the technology of  ultrasound imaging.  They should 
be familiar with alternative  and co mplementary imaging and diagnostic procedures and  should  be capable of 
correlating  the results of these other procedures  with t he sonographic findings. They s hould have a th orough 
understanding of u ltrasound technology and instrumentation,  ultrasound po wer ou tput, equipment cali bration, and 
safety.  Physicia ns responsible for breast ultras ound examinations s hould de monstrate fa miliarit y with breast 
anatomy, physiology, and pathology. These physicians s hould provide evide nce of the training a nd co mpetence  
need ed to perform bre ast ultrasound exa minations successfully.  
 
Physicians performing and/or interpreting   breast ultrasou nd examination s sho uld meet at least one of t he following  
criteria: 
 
Certification  in Radiology or Diagnostic Radiology by the American Board  of Radiology,  the A merican 
Osteopathic Board of Radiology, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada , or the Collège des 
Médecins  du Québec, and involvement with the supervision  and/or  performance,  interpretation ,  and reporting  
of  300  breast  ultras ound  examinations wit hin the last  36 months.1

or 
Completion of an Accred itatio n Council for Graduate Medical  Education  (ACGME) approved diagnostic rad iology 
residency  program and involvement with the supervision and /or performance, interpretation , and reporting of 
300 breast ultrasound examination s in the past 36 months.1 
or 
Physicia ns not board  certif ied in radiology or not trained  in a diagnostic radiology resid ency p rogram, and  w ho  
assume  these  respo nsibilities  f or sonographic ima ging of the breast, should meet the f ollowing  criteria: 
completion of an ACGME ap proved  residency  program  in  specialty  practice p lus 200 hours of Category I 
continuing medical edu cation  (CME)  in  breast  ultrasou nd;  and sup ervision and/or performance, interpretation , 
and re porting of   500 breast ultrasou nd examinations during the past 36 months in a supervised situation. 
 
Maintenance of Co mpetence  
 
All physicians performing ultrasound  examinations  shou ld demonstrate evidenc e of continuing competence in the 
interpretatio n and rep orting of those examination s. If co mpetence is assur ed prima rily based  on continu ing 
experienc e, a minimum of  100 examinations  per year is recommended in order to maintain the physician’s skills. 
Because a physician’s pract ice or location may  preclude this method, continued competency can a lso be as sured 
through monitoring and evaluation that indicates acceptable technical  success, accuracy of interpretation, and 
appropria teness  of evaluation. 
 
Continuing Medical E ducation 
 
The physicia n’s continuing education should be in accord ance with the ACR Practice Gu ideline for Continuing 
Medical Educatio n (CME ) and should include CME in  ultrasonography as is a ppropriate to  his or her practice.  
  
B.   Diagnostic Medical S onographer 
 
When a sonographer p erforms the examination, he or  she sh ould be qualified by appropriate training to do so. This 
qualificatio n can  be de monstrated by certification  or eli gibility f or certificati on by a nationa lly recognized 
certifyi ng body. 
 
 
 
1Completion  of an accredited rad iology residency  in the past 24 months will be  presu med to be satisfac tory experience for the 
performance,  reporting,  and interpreting  requirement.  
 
IV. WRITTEN REQUEST FOR THE E XAMINAT ION 
 
The written  or electr onic req uest for a breast ultraso und e xamination should provide sufficie nt information to 
demonstrate the  medical necessity of the ex amination and allo w for its p roper performance and i nterpretatio n. 
Documentation that satisfies  medical necessity includes 1) signs  and symptoms and/or 2)  relevant hi story (including 
known diagnoses). A dditional information regarding the specific  reason  for the examination or a provisional 
diagnosis would be hel pful and may at times be ne eded to allo w for  the proper performance and interpretatio n of the 
examination.  
 
The request  for the examination  must be  originated by a phy sician or oth er appropriately  licensed  health  care 
provider.  The accompanying  clinical information should be  provided by a physician or other appropriately licensed 
health  care provider fa miliar with the patient’s clinical problem or question and consistent with the state’s  scope of 
practice req uirements.  (ACR Reso lution (35), ado pted in 2006)

V. SPECIF ICATIONS  FOR INDIVIDUAL EXAMINAT IONS  
 
A. Image labeling should include a per manent i dentificatio n label that co ntains: 
 
1. Facility name and locatio n. 
2. Examination date.  
3. Patie nt’s first a nd last name. 
4. Identifying number and/or date of b irth. 
5. Desig nation of right or left breast.  
6. Anatomic location  using clock face notation  or a labeled diagram of the breas t. Transducer orie ntation and 
distance from the nipple to the abnor mality, if present, are  required. 
7. Sonographer’s and/or physician’s  identification  number, initials, or  other sym bol. 
 
B.   Lesion Ch aracterization  and Technical Factors [3]  
 
1. The breast  sonogram shou ld be correlated  with cli nical signs a nd/or s ymptoms and with m ammographi c 
and other appropriate breast i maging studies. If sonography has been p erfor med previously, t he current examination 
shou ld be co mpared with pr ior sono grams, as appropriate.  A lesion or  any area of the breast b eing studied  should   be  
viewed  in  2 perpendicular projection s, and real-time scann ing by the interpreter is e ncoura ged. 
 
2. The size of a lesion should be determined by recor ding its maximal dimensions in at least 2 planes;  
orthogonal  planes  are recom mended. At least 1 set of i mages of a lesion should be obtain ed wit hout calip ers. 
 
3. The images shou ld be label ed as to right or left breast, l ocation of lesio ns, and the orie ntation of t he 
transducer with respect to  the breast (e.g., transverse or l ongitudinal, ra dial or antiradial). The  location of  the lesion  
should be recorded using clock face notation and distance from the nipple, and/or shown  on a diagram of  the 
breast. The length of the transducer face (footprint), us ually between 3.5 cm and  5 cm, can be used to esti mate the 
distance  from the  nipple. Measure ments shou ld not be made  from the  edge of the areo la, as areo lar width is w idely 
variable. 
 
4. Sonographic      features      are      helpful      in charact erizing breast masses. Th ese feature categories  
and their descr iptors are listed and exemplified in the  ACR  Breast  Imaging Re porting and Data Syste m® (BI-
RADS®). The BI -RADS  sonogr aphic categories  include size, sh ape, orientation, margin, echogenicity, lesion 
boundary, attenuation  (e.g., s hadowing or enha ncement), special  cases, vascul arity, and surround ing tissue  [3]. 
 
5. Elast ography, or tissue  stiffness  assess ment, is among the new feature categories  applica ble to 
sonographic analysis  of masses,  to be included in the  Associat ed Findings  section in BI-RADS – Ultrasound, 
edition 2. To mi nimize errors in co mmunication or interpretation, if elast ography is performed, the   color  scales  
should  be an notated  to denote ha rdness or softnes s. 
 
6. Mass characterization  with  ultrasonography is highly dependent on technical factors. 
 
Breast ultraso und should be pe rformed with a high-resolution scanner (see section VII). Gain settings, focal zone 
selection s, and fields  of view s hould be optimized to obtain  high-quality images. The patient should be positioned 
to minimize the thickness of the  p ortion  of  the breast be ing evaluated. For evaluation of lesions in,  on, or just 
beneath  the skin, a stand -off d evice or thick layer  of gel may be hel pful.

(See the ACR Practice Gu ideline for the P erformance of Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Breast I nterventional 
Procedur es.) 
 
When ultraso und guidance is used to assist  in needle place ment for interv entional procedures,  care should be 
taken  to ensure that scann ing geometry and  transducer place ment permit  adequate visualization  of the  needle and 
the needle tip.  
 
VI.        DOCUMEN TATION 
 
Images of all important findings, includ ing, in the case of interventional procedures, t he relati onship of the needle to 
the lesion, should be re corded in a re trievable and revi ewable image  storage format. It i s recommended  that 
documentation of a nega tive targeted or w hole breast u ltrasound examination be performed. 
 
Adequate documentation is esse ntial f or high-quality patient care. There should  be a  permanent  record  of the 
ultrasou nd examination and its interpretatio n. Comparison w ith prior relevant imaging studies may prove helpful. 
Images   of   all   appropriate   areas,   both   normal   and ab normal, should  be recorded .  Variations from  normal  
size should generally be accompanied by measure ment. The initials  of the operator  should be accessi ble on the 
images or electronically  on PACS.  Images should be la beled with the patient identification , facility id entificatio n, 
examination date , and image  orientation . An o fficial interpretati on (final report) of the ultrasound e xamination 
should be included in the patient’s medical record. It is  recom mended that  the re port i nclude a descr iption   of   the   
area   scann ed.   Ret ention   of   the ultras ound   ex amination   i mages   s hould be   bas ed   on clinical need and with 
relevant legal and local health  care facility re quireme nts. 
 
If ult rasound is performed for evaluating cli nical signs and /or symptoms or a finding on mammogra phy, MRI, or 
other breast imaging  modality, the finding(s) should be referred  to in the rep ort. Re porting of lesi ons should 
gene rally include measur ements. Use of an accept ed reporting system , such as BI-RADS®    US, is 
recommended.  
 
Reporting should be in accordance with ACR Prac tice Guideline for Communicatio n of Diagnostic  Imaging 
Findings. 
 
VII.       EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS  
 
Breast  ultrasound should be performed with a high- resolution real-time linear  array scanner op erating at a center 
frequency  of  at  lea st  10  MHz  and  pr eferably higher. Other transducers may  be utilized in special circu mstances.  
Focal  zones should  be electronically adjustable.  In gene ral, the highest frequency capab le of ade quate pen etration to 
the depth of interest should be used. For evaluating superficial  lesion s, scanning through a  thin stand-off dev ice or 
thick layer of gel may be  helpful in offsetting  the transducer face from the uppermost layer of skin, to bring it into 
the focal zon e of the transducer. 
 
VIII.  QUALITY  CONTROL  AND IMPROVEMENT, S AFETY, INFECTION CO NTROL, AND 
PATIENT EDUCA TION  
 
Policies a nd procedures related  to quality, patient educatio n, infection  control, and safety sho uld be devel oped and

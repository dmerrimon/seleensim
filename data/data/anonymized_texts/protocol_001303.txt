Statistical Analysis Overview   
1. Descriptively characterize the: (a) feasibility of the SHE Program, and the (b) 
acceptability  via participant report of ease of use, helpfulness , and overall satisfaction.  
2. Examine preliminary evidence that relative to co ntrol condition, the computer-based 
intervention (SHE) will result in improvements in o ur primary outcomes of substance use 
(heavy drinking or drug using) days over a 6-month postshelter period and in our 
secondary outcomes of greater use of substance use services (both treatment and self-
help utilization) and reduced IPV severity over a 6 -month postshelter period. Theorized 
mediators include readiness to change and self-effi cacy for behaviors related to 
substance use.

Comments   
Assessment of feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and research procedures is the 
project’s primary goal.  However, pilot data can be  used to demonstrate whether the effects of 
treatment look promising across a set of outcome va riables.  We will obtain the between 
treatment condition effect size estimates at each a ssessment and the correlation between the 
same dependent variable at adjacent assessments.  A  sample of ~20-21 in each condition 
should provide some information relevant to demonst rating potential promise for the 
intervention.  
 
Type of Statistical Test  [*]   
Other (primary analyses focus on feasibility and ac ceptability) 
 
Comments  [*]   
Secondary analyses will explore differences between  conditions on outcome variables.   
Statistical Test of Hypothesis  (or Method of Estimation or Other Statistical Analys is required )  
We will calculate the effect sizes and 95% confiden ce intervals for intervention effects on 
outcomes using hierarchical linear modeling with a tightly constrained covariance structure.  
However, this is not primarily a hypothesis-testing  study.   
P-Value  [*]   
There is no null hypothesis.  If we use any p-value , it will be .05.

Method  [*]   
We will calculate the effect sizes and 95% confiden ce intervals for intervention effects on 
outcomes using hierarchical linear modeling with a tightly constrained covariance structure.  
Baseline values of each outcome variable will serve  as a covariate in analyses.  However, 
primary results are descriptive results of feasibil ity and acceptability.

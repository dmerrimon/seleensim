Title of Study:  A Biom arker -Guided , Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Efficacy and 
Safety Study of Liafensine in Patients with Treatment -Resistant Depression  
Study Center(s):  Multiple  
Phase of Development:  2b 
Rationale:  
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 
approximately 13 -17% in the United States ( Hasin 2005 , Kessler 2005 ). Although options for 
pharmacologic treatment have expa nded significantly in the past 25 years, between one -third and 
two-thirds of patients will not respond to the first antidepressant prescribed, and up to 33%  will not 
respond to multiple interventions ( American Psychiatric Association 2013 , Berlim 2008 , Cain 2007 ). 
Novel antidepressants that produce a clinically significant improvement in patients with MDD who 
have failed to resp ond to more than one treatment of adequate dose and duration, without producing 
significant side effects, would represent an important advance in the treatment of treatment -resistant 
depression (TRD).  
For most of the last 30 years, the biogenic amine hypot hesis of depression has been driving much of 
the research into the etiology and treatment of this debilitating psychiatric disorder. Most conventional 
antidepressants are antagonists at serotonin (5 -HT) and/or norepinephrine reuptake sites, and their 
efficacy correlates reasonably well with their affinity for these receptors. At present, the most 
commonly used treatments for MDD are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as 
escitalopram, or the serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors  (SNRIs), such as duloxetine. 
Recently, a compound with a novel mechanism of action, esketamine ( SPRAVATO®), was approved 
in the United States ( US) for the treatment of TRD in conjunction with an oral antidepressant  
(SPRAVATO 2019 ). While the precise mechanism of action of esketamine is unknown, the compound 
is an N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Esketamine use is associated with significant 
adverse effect s including dizziness, nausea, sedation, and psychological effects, including 
dissociative/perceptual changes. Because of the risks of dissociation with esketamine, the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) has established a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) 
requiring that patients be monitored by a healthcare professional for at least 2 hours at each treatment 
session, concluding with an assessment establishing that the patient is clinically stable and may safely 
leave the healthcare setting.

CONFIDENTIAL  This adverse event profile, together with esketamine’s REMS requirements, limits its clinical utility, 
and supports the continued development of novel compounds for the treatment of TRD.  
Liafensine (also known as DB104 and previously  BMS -820836 ) is 6 -[(4S)-1,2,3,4 -tetrahydro -2-
methyl -4-(2-naphthalenyl) -7-isoquinolinyl] -3-pyridazinamine and it is a potent and selective inhibitor 
of the reuptake of the 3 monoamines: 5 -HT, norepinephrine , and dopamine. Liafensine was developed 
to incrementally advance antidepr essant treatment by synergizing these individual monoaminergic 
approaches to treating depression.  
Liafensine has been tested in 11  Phase  1 studies, and 3  Phase  2b studies (including one rollover study). 
In the Phase  1 studies, single doses of up to 5  mg, a nd multiple doses of up to 4  mg liafensine were 
found  to be  generally safe and well tolerated . The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of liafensine was 
compatible with once -daily (QD) dosing, supporting the potential for liafensine to have low potential 
for discontinuation symptoms. In the Phase  2b studies, patients who did not experience adequate 
response to either duloxetine (Study  CN162006) , or duloxetine or escitalopram (Study CN162007), 
were randomized to receive either liafensine or duloxetine (CN162006 ), or duloxetine or escitalopram 
(CN162007) , for 6 weeks. In Study  CN162006, a flexible dose of liafensine was used (0.5 -2 mg QD). 
In Study CN162007, several fixed dosage levels of liafensine were used (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2  mg QD). 
In these Phase  2b studies , liafensine was found to be generally safe and well tolerated . In Study 
CN162006, the most common adverse events ( AEs) reported by at least 5% of patients treated with 
liafensine were headache  (7.0%), nausea  (7.0%), constipation  (5.3%), and anxiety  (5.3%) . In Study 
CN162007, the most common AEs reported by at least 5% of patients treated with any dose of 
liafensine were headache  (14.3%), nausea  (12.0%), nasopharyngitis  (8.8%), upper respiratory tract 
infection  (8.0%), dry mouth  (8.0%), constipation  (7.7%),  dizziness  (7.0%), diarrhea  (5.5%), 
fatigue  (5.9%), and urinary tract infection  (5.5%).  
In the Phase  2b studies  conducted by Bristol -Myers Squibb ( BMS ), there were no significant 
differences noted between the treatment groups in the decrease (improvement) of the  mean 
Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale  (MADRS) total score. In an effort to identify a potential 
pharmacogen omic biomarker of response to liafensine,  Denovo Biopharma LLC (Denovo) has 
conducted a genome -wide scan with human whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
arrays using germline deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) extracted from blood samples of patients in BMS 
Studies CN162006 and C N162007. From this genome -wide screening, SNP rs12217173 was identified 
as strongly associated with treatment respons e to liafensine  (p = 6.6 x10-8). Patients with a GG 
genotype at rs12217173 showed significantly better response to liafensine compared to patients with an 
AA or AG genotype, or patients in the control arm (duloxetine or escitalopram). These findings were 
replicated using a separate validation sample set. Liafensine treatment effects in patients with the GG 
genotype were comparabl e for the 0.5 to 2  mg QD flexible doses in the CN162006 study and for the 
1 mg QD and 2  mg QD doses in the CN162007 study. These combined data showed that patients with 
the GG genotype had a 4.7 -point difference in MADRS total score decrease from baseline in the 
liafensine arm vs the control arm (p  = 0.025), while patients with the AA or AG genotype at 
rs12217173 did not show an improved treatment effect in the liafensine arm vs the control arm 
(MADRS  0.3-point difference, p  = 0.74). Moreover, patients carr ying different genotypes at 
rs12217173 did not exhibit different treatment responses to duloxetine or escitalopram. Thus, SNP 
rs12217173 appears to be a pharmacogenomic biomarker specific for liafensine; Denovo has termed 
rs12217173 as “DGM4” (Denovo Genom ic Marker 4) and the GG genotype of DGM4 is defined as 
DGM4 positive, whereas the AA or AG genotype of DGM4 is defined as DGM4 negative.

CONFIDENTIAL  Study Design:  
This study will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase  2b 
trial to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of liafensine  in DGM4 -stratified TRD patients . 
The study includes an up to 2 1-day screening period.  
Approximately 180 patients with TRD who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 :1 
ratio to receive either liafensine 1  mg QD, liafensine 2  mg QD, or placebo QD for 6 weeks. 
Approximately 150  randomized patients carrying  genotype GG at DGM4 (DGM4 -positive) and 
approximately 30 randomized patients carrying  genotype AA or AG at DGM4 (DGM4 -negative)  will 
be enrolled in this study . DGM4 status (positive vs negative) of randomized patients will be blinded to 
the sites , the p atients , and sponsor.  An Inte ractive Response Technology (IRT) system will be used for 
blinding DGM4 status, and to achieve the planned  randomization ratio of 
DGM4 -positive :DGM4 -negative patients by randomly excluding most screened DGM4 -negative 
patients (~80%). Randomization will be stratified by DGM4 status (positive vs negative) and region 
(North America vs Other). Patients who complete the study or discontinue after randomization will 
have two post-study follow -up visits (14  days after the last administered dose of study drug, and 
28 days after the last administered dose of study drug) ; the 2nd follow -up visit will be conducted via 
phone call.  Every effort  will be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed.  
During the study, safety will be assessed on the basis of spontaneously reported AEs; the DESS; 
physical, neurological, and psychiatric examinations (including the C -SSRS); v ital signs  including 
supine and standing  blood pressure and heart rate ; weight; 12 -lead ECGs; clinical laboratory test 
results; serum and urine pregnancy tests (females of childbearing potential only); and concomitant 
medication assessments. In addition to  blood samples collect ed for PK, additional b lood samples may 
be collected for determination of plasma concentrations of liafensine and its primary metabolite  in 
association with the evaluation of safety signals . 
The overall study design is shown in Figure  1. The schedule of study assessments is presented in 
Table  1 with the clinical laboratory t ests shown in Table  3. 
To ensure the safety of patients enrolled in this study, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(IDMC) will monitor data on an  ongoing basis. The IDMC will comprise individuals external to the 
sponsor  and will consist of at least one medical expert in the relevant therapeutic area, at least one 
hepatologist, and at least one statistician.  
Methodology:  
This is a randomized, doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled Phase  2b trial to assess the efficacy, safety, 
tolerability, and PK of liafensine. The primary endpoint is change in MADRS total score from baseline 
(Visit  3, Day  -1) to Visit  7 (Day  42) in DGM4 -positive patients. The primary analysis will be 
conducted to assess the superiority of liafensine treatment (combined liafensine 1  mg QD and 2  mg 
QD doses ) vs placebo in randomized patients who are DGM4 -positive.

CONFIDENTIAL  Sample Size Justification:  
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive liafensine  1 mg QD, liafensine  2 mg QD, or 
placebo QD. The primary analysis is to assess treatment difference in MADRS total score change from 
baseline (Visit  3, Day  -1) to Visit  7 (Day  42), between the  combined liafensine 1  mg QD and 2  mg QD 
doses vs placebo, in DGM4 -positive patients. A sample size of 47 randomized DGM4 -positive patients 
per arm is sufficient to detect a 4.5 -unit difference between the combined liafensine 1  mg QD and 2  mg 
QD treatment groups  and the placebo treatment group in the change in MADRS total score with 80% 
power at the 2 -sided 0.05  alpha level, assuming a standard deviation of 9 units.  
To compensate for potential loss of power due to randomized patients who do not take at least one 
dose of study drug or who do not have a post-randomization efficacy evaluation  (~5%),  a total of 
approximately 150 DGM4 -positive patients (50  DGM4 -positive pa tients per arm) will be randomized.  
To examine trend in the total patient  population and in the subgroup of DGM4 -negative patients in 
order to evaluate DGM4 as a potential biomarker for predicting response to liafensine, approximately 
20% additional  DGM4 -negative  patients (10 per arm, total approximately 30) will also be randomized. 
The sample size of 30  randomized patients in the DGM4 -negative group is not estimated based on 
formal statistics in terms of power and alpha level.  
Sample size re -estimation may  be conducted if the percentage of missing data at Day 42 visit is higher 
than expected and/or if the observed variance is higher than the one assumed in the sample size 
estimation.

28 days after the last dose of study drug) . 
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
None . 
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the change in MADRS total score from baseline (Visit  3, 
Day -1) to Visit  7 (Day  42) in DGM4 -positive patients.  
Other assessments include CGI-S, CGI -I and SDS . See Table  1 for the overall schedule of efficacy 
assessments.  Note that CGIs should be completed only after the  Patient Rated Depression and 
Functioning Check list (PRDF Checklist) has been complet ed as instructed . 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be collected for determination of concentrations of liafensine and its primary 
metabolite on Day  28 (Visit  6) and on Day  42 (Visit  7) prior to dosing. The time of prior dose and time 
of blood collection will be recorded.  
If the patient discontinues before Day  42 (Visit  7), a blood sample will be collected for PK on the last 
day the patient takes a full dose of study drug or as soon as possible thereafter, but wit hin 3  days after 
the last dose in any case. When possible, and if medically appropriate, blood samples should be 
collected for PK from patients who experience a serious adverse event (SAE) or overdose.  
Pharmacogenomics : 
PGx testing is required to determine eligibility for the study.  PGx analysis may determine the 
association between genetic variations and the patient's response to treatment with liafensine.  
Safety:  

Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page  14 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  Safety will be assessed based on  spontaneously reported AEs;  the DESS scale; physical, neurological, 
and psychiatric examinations (including C -SSRS); vital signs  including orthostatic changes in blood 
pressure and heart rate; weight; 12 -lead ECGs; clinical laboratory test results; serum and urine 
pregnancy tests (f emales of childbearing potential only); and concomitant medication assessments. 
Safety assessments in addition to those specified may be performed to ensure patient safety if judged 
appropriate by the investigator.  
See Table  1 for the overall schedule of safety assessments.  
Psychiatric assessments will be performed by a psychiatrist or trained and certified clinical staff 
member. Neurologic assessments will be performed by an experienced clinician.  
Patients fulfilling Hy’s law, defined as [ALT or AST ≥  3 × ULN] and [ TBL ≥ 2 × ULN], in  the 
absence of significant increase in  ALP and in the absence of an alterna tive diagnosis that explains the 
increase in total bilirubin, will be discontinued, with medical follow -up as appropriate.  
An IDMC will be established to monitor data on an ongoing basis to ensure the continuing safety of 
patients enrolled in this study. T he IDMC will comprise individuals external to the sponsor  and will 
consist of at least one medical expert in the relevant therapeutic area, at least one hepatologist, and at 
least one statistician. The IDMC’s responsibilities, authorities, and procedures, with details of 
decision -making guidance and dissemination of the results, will be documented in the IDMC charter.  
Statistical Methods : 
Efficacy Analyses : 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which includes all randomized 
patients who took at least one dose of study drug and  had a post -randomization efficacy evaluation. 
The FAS population will be analyzed by treatment randomized  regardless of the actual treatment 
received.  
The primary and secondary efficacy results of the study will be based on analysis in FAS patient s with 
DGM4 -positive  biomarker.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in MADRS total score from baseline (Visit  3, Day  -1) to 
Day 42 (Visit  7), in DGM4 -positive patients. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed at 
2-sided significance level of 0.05 using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) that includes 
the fixed effects of treatment, visit (categorical covariate), treatment -by-visit interact ion, baseline 
MADRS total score (continuous covariate), and region. An unstructured variance -covariance matrix 
will be used. The least -squares (LS) mean change in MADRS total score at Day  42 from baseline for 
the combined liafensine treatment arms (1  mg QD  and 2  mg QD) and placebo arm will be estimated 
from the MMRM model. Prior work suggests that both doses of liafensine may be efficacious , 
therefore, t he treatment effect for the combined liafensine treatment arms vs placebo will be estimated 
using the LS means’ difference at Day  42 from the MMRM model. The comparison of the change in 
MADRS total score from baseline to Day  42 between each of the 2  liafen sine treatment arms and 
placebo will be carried out using the same approach.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint will be  the change from baseline in CGI-S at Day  42 in 
DGM4 -positive patients. CGI -S will be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the primary 
efficacy endpoint.   
Other secondary  efficacy endpoints include  CGI-I and SDS at Day 42 as continuous endpoints . These 
endpoints will be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The explorat ory efficacy results of the study will also be based on analysis in FAS patients.  
Response rate, remission rate, and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for each treatment 

Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page  15 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  group will be derived by using Clopper -Pearson method. The comparison of response rates and 
remission rates between treatment groups at Day 42 will be carried out using the Cochran –Mantel –
Haenszel (CMH) test.  
Subscales, individual items, and domains of endpoints will also be analyzed in an exp loratory manner, 
using the same MMRM model as for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The change in MADRS total score from baseline in DGM4 -negative patients will be analyzed using 
the same approach as described for the primary endpoint analysis in the DGM4 -positive patients. The 
LS mean of the change in MADRS total score for each treatment group and the treatment difference in 
DGM4 -negative patients will be estimated. The treatment effects between the DGM4 -positive and 
negative patients will be compared primari ly in descriptive fashion to examine the trend, and may be 
evaluated by including the interaction of DGM4 status and treatment group in the mixed model.  
Safety Analyses:  
Safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population, which includes all randomized patients who 
have received at least one dose of study drug. The safety population will be analyzed by the  actual 
treatment received regardless of treatment randomized . 
The incidence and severity of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by 
treatment. Vital signs  including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate , weight, ECG, 
clinical laboratory evaluation, DESS scale , and C -SSRS data will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics, by visit and by treatment.  
Safety and tolerability data will be summarized descriptively, including tables, listings, and graphs, as 
appropriate. Unless otherwise stated, descriptive summary statistics for co ntinuous variables will 
include number (N), mean (ie, arithmetic mean), standard deviation (SD), minimum, median, and 
maximum. Descriptive summary statistics for categorical data will include frequency and proportion.  
All data will be presented by treatmen t regimen.  
Individual data for vital signs  including supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate , weight, 
clinical laboratory measures , and ECG assessments will be listed and summarized for any potentially 
clinically important (PCI) values according to predetermined PCI criteria.  
There will be no imputation (substitution) for missing data unless explicitly specified otherwise in this 
protocol or in the statistical analysis plan.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
PK data collected in this study will be included in a  population PK analysis of plasma concentrations 
of liafensine and its primary metabolite . It will be performed using a nonlinear mixed -effects modeling 
approach. The analysis will evaluate the effects of age, sex, ethnicity, and other covariates on the PK 
profile of liafensine.  The results of this analysis with be reported separately.  
Statistical Analysis Plan:  
Additional details of the analyses will be provided in the statistical analysis plan which will be 
finalized prior to unblinding .

a Every effort should be made for visits to occur on the designated study days. A ±  3-day visit window  is permitted at all visits except for Screening and Baseline 
(Day  -1). The overall treatment period in the protocol should be maintained (ie, visits should be scheduled based on the baseline v isit rather than the previous 
visit). Study procedures designat ed for a specific visit should be performed on 1  day whenever this is possible and in the best interest of the patient. If this is not 
possible and/or not in the best interest of the patient, study procedures may be performed across more than 1  day but wit hin the visit window.  
b Randomized patients who complete the study or discontinue early will have two follow -up visits (14 and 28 days after the last dose of study drug), the 2nd 
follow -up visit will be conducted via phone call.  
 c Visit  2 activities are performed only after the confirmation of initial eligibility including PGx.  Patien ts who screen fail due to PGx status are not eligible for re -
screening.

CONFIDENTIAL  e Baseline evaluations will be performed on Day  -1. Patients will be instructed to take the first dose of double -blind study drug the day after baseline evaluations 
(ie, on Day  1), and will be in structed to take double -blind study drug for the remainder of the 6 -week treatment period.  
 f For patients who discontinue early from the study, safety and efficacy determinations designated for Day  42 will be performed on the last day the patient takes 
a full dose of study drug or as soon as possible thereafter, but within 3  days of their last dose in any event.  
g At Visit  1, two brief ICFs will be obtained for the purpose of genot yping and biobanking, separately. A full ICF must be obtained at Visit  2. 
h  Refer to Appendix  2 Preliminary Diagnosis Checklist   
i  A separate blood s ample (6  mL) will be collected for PGx (eg, determination of DGM4 status at Screening and for future research at Visit  5). 
j The PRDF Checklist must be completed by the patient and reviewed by the rater 2  prior to CGI -S assessment. The baseline checklist e ntry must be compared 
by rater 2 against post -baseline entry to refresh the knowledge of patient’s baseline condition  prior to CGI -I assessment .

l C-SSRS  since -last-visit version 
m For randomized patients who complete the study or discontinue early, the DESS scale will be completed daily by the patient for 14 days post -last dose.  
n Vital signs should be taken prior to blood draws when applicable and include supine (after at least 5 min  rest) and standing ( after 1 min and 3 min  standing ), BP 
and heart rate, respiration rate, and temperature.  Vital signs can be repeated for up to 3 occurrences after Visit 2 to see if values return to normal range, but any 
abnormality must be resolved by the Baseline Visit . 
o ECG r ecordings will be completed prior to blood draws when applicable and will be performed in triplicate (at 1 -minute intervals between each of the three 
recordings) for baseline. Single ECG will be performed for rest of the timepoints.  
p Hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis will be performed at all visits with a laboratory determination. Serologic tests for HIV, hepatitis  B core antibody, 
hepatitis  B surface antigen, and hepatitis  C virus antibody, and a thyroid panel (TSH, FT3, and  FT4) will be completed only at Screening.  Laboratory tests can 
be repeated for up to 3 occurrences after Visit 2 to see if values return to normal range, but any abnormality must be resolv ed by the Baseline Visit . 
q To be conducted on Day -1 only if (1) t he screening period exceeds 21 days; (2) a longer than 21 -day prior medication washout is required, eg, fluoxetine 
> 20 mg/day; (3) per investigator’s judgement. For women of pre -menopause, an inquiry of menses status should be made in the presence of macr oscopic blood 
detection before submitting the sample to the central labs for microscopic examination.  
r Serum pregnancy testing will be performed in females of childbearing potential at Screening  1 and Day  42 (Visit  7). Urine pregnancy testing will be perf ormed 
at Baseline (Day  -1, dip stick).  
s Blood samples for PK will be collected on Day  28 (Visit  6) and on Day  42 (Visit  7) prior to dose administration, or at the time of early withdrawal, if within 
3 days of last dose. Time of last dose and time of blood  collection will be recorded. When possible, and if medically appropriate, blood samples should be 
collected for PK from patients who experience an SAE or overdose.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background  
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder, with a lifetime prevalence 
rate of approximately 13 -17% in the United States ( Hasin 2005,  Kessler 2005 ). Although o ptions 
for pharmacologic treatment have expanded significantly in the past 25 years, between one -third 
and two -thirds of patients will not respond to the first antidepressant prescribed, and up to 
33% will not respond to multiple interventions ( American Psychiatric Association 2013 , 
Berlim  2008 , Cain  2007 ). Novel antidepressants that produce a clinically significant 
improvement in patients with MDD who have failed  to respond to more than one treatment of 
adequate dose and duration, without producing significant side effects, would represent an 
important advance in the treatment of treatment -resistant depression (TRD).  
For most of  the last 30 years, the biogenic amine hypothesis of depression has been driving much 
of the research into the etiology and treatment of this debilitating psychiatric disorder. Most 
conventional antidepressants are antagonists at serotonin (5 -HT) and/or no repinephrine reuptake 
sites, and their efficacy correlates reasonably well with their affinity for these receptors. At 
present, the most commonly used treatments for MDD are the selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), such as escitalopram, or the serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors 
(SNRIs), such as duloxetine.  
Despite a plethora of pharmacologic and non -pharmacolo gic treatments, there is significant 
unmet need for better treatments for persons with depression.  Many patient s remain inadequately 
responsive to treatment . The STAR*D study  found that only 37% of depressed patients 
responded to a first step in  treatment with  decreasing likelihood of re sponse in later ste ps 
(31%,  14%, and 13%)  (Rush 2006 ). As many as 30% of pati ents remain treatment resistant after 
4 different treatment steps. Nor was there any rationa l progression for selecting an initial 
treatment . 
Recently, a compound with a novel mechanism o f action, esketamine ( SPRAVATO®), was 
approved in the United States ( US) for the treatment of TRD in conjunction with an oral 
antidepressant  (SPRAVATO 2019 ). While the precise mechanism of action of esketamine is 
unknown, the compound is an N -methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Esketamine is 
administered intranasally  through a restricted distribution system, under a Risk Evaluation and 
Mitigation Strategy (REMS) , and its use is associated w ith significant adverse effects including 
dizziness, nausea, sedation, and psychological effects. The most common psychological effects 
of esketamine are dissociative/perceptual changes (including distortion of time and space, and 
illusions), derealization , and depersonalization. Patients may describe these symptoms as feeling 
disconnected from themselves, their thoughts and feelings, space, and time. Because of the risks 
of dissociation with esketamine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has establi shed a 
REMS requiring that patients be monitored by a healthcare professional for at least 2 hours at 
each treatment session, concluding with  an assessment establishing that  the patient is clinically 
stable and may safely  leave the healthcare setting.  The persistent high numbers of treatment -
resistant patients, t he adverse event profile  and difficulty accessing  both existing and newer 
treatments , and the need to find better ways of driving treatment  selection to  treatment -
responsive pat ients  support the biomarker -driven development of liafensine  for TRD.

CONFIDENTIAL  1.2. Liafensine  
Liafensine (also known as DB104 and BMS -8208361) is 6 -[(4S)-1,2,3,4 -tetrahydro -2-methyl -4-
(2-naphthalenyl) -7-isoquinolinyl] -3-pyridazinamine and it is a potent and selective inhibi tor of 
the reuptake of the 3 monoamines: 5 -HT, norepinephrine , and dopamine. Liafensine was 
developed to incrementally advance antidepressant treatment by synergizing these individual 
monoaminergic approaches to treating depression.  
1.2.1.  Study Rationale  
Liafensine has been tested in 11  Phase  1 studies, and 3  Phase  2b studies (including one rollover 
study). In the Phase  1 studies, single doses of up to 5  mg, and multiple doses of up to 4  mg 
liafensine were found to be generally safe and well tolerated . The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile 
of liafensine was compatible with once -daily (QD) dosing, supporting the potential for liafensine 
to have low potential for discontinuation symptoms. In the Phase  2b studies,  patients  who did not 
experience adequate response to either duloxetine (Study  CN162006) , or duloxetine or 
escitalopram (Study CN162007), were randomized to receive either liafensine or duloxetine 
(CN162006), or duloxetine or escitalopram (CN162007) , for 6 weeks. In Study  CN162006, a 
flexible dose  of liafensine was used (0.5 -2 mg QD). In Study CN162007, several fixed dosage 
levels of liafensine were used (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2  mg QD). In these Phase  2b studies, liafensine 
was found to be generally safe and well tolerated . In Study CN162006, the most common 
adverse events (AEs) reported by at least 5% of  patients  treated with liafensine were 
headache  (7.0%), nausea  (7.0%), constipation  (5.3%), and anxiety  (5.3%). In Study CN162007, 
the most common AEs reported by at least 5% of  patients  treated with an y dose of liafensine 
were headache  (14.3%), nausea  (12.0%), nasopharyngitis  (8.8%), upper respiratory tract 
infection  (8.0%), dry mouth  (8.0%), constipation  (7.7%), dizziness  (7.0%), diarrhea  (5.5%), 
fatigue  (5.9%), and urinary tract infection  (5.5%).  
In the Phase  2b studies  conducted by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) , there were no significant 
differences  noted  between the treatment groups in the decrease (improvement)  of the mean 
Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale  (MADRS) total score.  In an  effort to identify a 
potential pharmacogenomic biomarker of response to liafensine,  Denovo Biopharma LLC 
(Denovo) has conducted a genome -wide scan with human whole genome single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) arrays using germline deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) extracted from blood 
samples of patients in BMS Studies CN162006 and CN162007. From this genome -wide 
screening, SNP rs12217173 was identified as strongly associated with treatment respons e to 
liafensine  (p = 6.6 x10-8). Patients with a GG genotype at rs12217173 showed significantly better 
response to liafensine compared to patients with an AA or AG genotype, or patients in the 
control arm (duloxetine or escitalopram). These findings were replicated using a separate 
validation sample set. Liafensine tre atment effects in patients with the GG genotype were 
comparable for the 0.5 to 2  mg QD flexible doses in the CN162006 study and for the 1  mg QD 
and 2  mg QD doses in the CN162007 study. These combined data showed that patients with the 
GG genotype had  a 4.7-point difference in MADRS total score decrease from baseline in the 
liafensine arm vs the control arm (p  = 0.025), while patients with the AA or AG genotype at 
rs12217173 did not show an improved treatment effect in the liafensine arm vs the control arm 
 
1 BMS -820836 -03 was selected for the dosage form development and is also referred to as BMS -820836.  
Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 30 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  (MADRS  0.3-point difference, p  = 0.74). Moreover, patients carrying different genotypes at 
rs12217173 did not exhibit different treatment responses to duloxetine or escitalopram. Thus, 
SNP rs12217173 appears to be a pharmacogenomic biomarker specific for li afensine; Denovo 
has termed rs12217173 as “DGM4” (Denovo Genomic Marker 4) and the GG genotype of 
DGM4 is defined as DGM4 positive, whereas the AA or  AG genotype of DGM4 is defined as 
DGM4 negative.  
DGM4 is located at the ANK3  gene locus, and the ANK3 gene  has been found to be associated 
with depression and other central nervous system ( CNS ) disorders, including bipolar disorder 
(Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium 2014 , Craddock 2013 , 
Mühleisen 2014 , Rangaraju 2016 ). Additionally , Zhu et al. found that in a genetic mouse model 
with conditional disruption of forebrain Ank3  pyramidal neurons (Ank3 cKO), repeated social 
defeat stress resulted in repeated episodes of dramatic behavioral changes ranging from 
hyperactivity to “ depression -like” behavior ( Zhu 2017 ). 
Taken together, these data strongly support the potential utility and further study of liafensine in 
DGM4 -positive patients with TRD . 
1.2.2.  Summary of Relevant Prior Animal  Studies  
Background information in addition to that presented below is available in the Investigator’s 
Brochure . 
1.2.2.1.  Absorption, Metabolism , and Drug Interactions  
Based on in vitro studies, the metabolism of liafensine is judged to be primarily mediated by 
CYP3A4 with additional contributions from CYP1A1/2,  CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19.  
In vitro, liafensine exhibited some inhibition of CYPs 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6, with IC 50 estimates 
of > 1 µM. Liafensine was a time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and does not induce relevant 
human CYPs. Liafensine was a weak inhibitor of P -gp with an IC 50 of ~20  M (~7.3  g/mL). 
Clinically relevant concentrations of liafensine are in the low ng/mL range, sugge sting a low 
potential for drug interactions involving P -gp inhibition, CYP induction, or CYP inhibition  at the 
doses examined . Similarly, low plasma concentrations of its active metabolite, 821007 , in vivo 
suggest low potential for drug interactions at cli nically relevant concentrations.  
Because liafensine is a substrate for CYP3A4, exposure to liafensine may be altered by 
co-administered drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme.  
1.2.2.2.  Preclinical Toxicity  
Liafensine has a moderate potential for acute toxicity. Single oral doses up to 20  mg/kg were 
tolerated in the rat, and a dose of 0.6  mg/kg was tolerated in monkeys, with clinical findings 
consistent with targeted inhibition of monoamine reuptake including stereotypic behaviors and 
elevations in  body temperature; increased activity, abnormal respiration in rats; and decreased 
feeding behavior and evidence of skeletal muscle injury in monkeys.  
After repeated dosing, liafensine was clinically tolerated up to 3  mg/kg/day in rats and 
1 mg/kg/day in m onkeys for up to 3  months. The primary treatment -related findings were 
pharmacologically -mediated effects including decreases in food consumption and body weight, 

Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 31 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  increased activity, and stereotypic behaviors at all doses. Target organs were limited to skeletal 
muscle in rats and monkeys after 2  weeks of dosing and the liver in rats after chronic dosing.  
Liafensine -related skeletal muscle injury and repair, which may have been a consequence of 
pharmacologically mediated increases in activity and/or direc t adrenergic stimulation, were 
observed only at higher doses in rats (up to 6  mg/kg/day) and monkeys (up to 5  mg/kg/day) after 
dosing ( area under the curve [ AUC ] multiples at ≥  12-fold in the rat and 3.8 -fold in the monkey). 
The generally minimal severity and limited distribution of these drug -related skeletal muscle 
changes likely accounted for the absence of correlative increases in serum muscle -related 
enzymes (AST, CK). There was no skeletal muscle injury noted in rats or monkeys after 
3 months of dosin g at systemic exposure multiples up to 61 - and 4 -fold, respectively. The lack of 
liafensine -related effects on the skeletal muscle after 3  months suggests accommodation with 
repeat dosing. Routine evaluation of serum AST and CK activities are anticipated t o be adequate 
for monitoring for the development of skeletal muscle changes in humans in the clinical studies.  
There was liafensine -related hepatotoxicity in rats after 3 and 6  months of dosing, which 
included the dose -related presence of multinucleate hep atocytes, Kupffer cell hypertrophy and 
pigment accumulation, and increases (1.2 to 4-fold) in liver transaminases. A lack of progression 
of the hepatotoxicity in rats was noted, comparing incidence and severity from subchronic to 
chronic studies. Moreover,  there was no evidence of hepatic inflammation or fibrosis associated 
with chronic treatment in rats. Evidence of partial or complete recovery of most liafensine -
related findings including all target organ effects were noted in rats. Test article -related h epatic 
changes were not associated with increased hepatocellular proliferation or ultrastructural changes 
indicative of abnormal cell division.  
There were no liafensine -related effects on the liver in monkeys after subchronic (3  months) or 
chronic (9  month s) of dosing, where systemic exposures overlapped with those that produced 
liver changes in rats. Moreover, there were no liafensine -related effects on the liver in mice 
treated for up to 3  months. Collectively, the absence of drug -related hepatic changes at 
overlapping or higher systemic exposures in monkeys and mice treated subchronically/ 
chronically with liafensine suggests the treatment -related hepatotoxicity is rat specific . 
1.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics in Humans  
The absorption of liafensine from either oral solu tion or tablet formulation was relatively slow. 
From the oral solution, the median tmax was approximately 5.0 –7.2 hours postdose after single 
doses (0.025 to 5  mg), and 4 –5 hours after once -daily doses for 14  days (0.1 to 4  mg). In the 
relative bioavailability study (CN162004), the median tmax was 7  hours from both the solution 
and tablet. Additionally, the PK of liafensine from the tablet formulation given with a high -fat 
meal was comparable to that under fasting conditions.  The adjusted geometric means ratio of the 
Cmax and AUC (0-72h) from the tablet with the high -fat meal vs tablet under fasting conditions was 
1.021 (90% CI: 0.955, 1.092) and 1.018 (90% CI: 0.966, 1.071), respectively. Therefore, 
liafensine may be administe red without regard to food.  
Steady state of liafensine was achieved after approximately 10  days of QD dosing (0.1 to 2  mg 
QD), and by Day  12 after 3  mg titration. The accumulation of liafensine AUC t after 14  days of 
once  daily dosing ranged from 2.67 to 4. 59. 
Liafensine exhibited low to moderate variability in plasma exposures. The variability 
(% coefficient of variation [CV]) of C max and AUC ranged from 14% to 29% and 12% to 44%, 
Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 32 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  respectively, in the single ascending dose ( SAD ) study , and 6% to 40% and 8% to 40%, 
respectively, in the multiple ascending dose ( MAD ) studies. 
Based on in vitro studies, liafensine is primarily metabolized by multiple CYP enzymes, 
including CYP3A4 as a predominant enzyme, with additional contributions from CYP1A1/2, 
CYP2C9/19, and CYP2D6. The elimination of liafensine was relatively slow. The mean t ½ 
ranged from 34 –57 hours after single doses, and 44 –74 hours after repeat daily doses for 14  days. 
Following a single oral dose administration of [14C]liafensine in adult male healthy volunteers, 
63% and 78% of the dose was recovered by Day  22 and Day  64, respectively. When extrapolated 
to infinity, approximately 83% of the dose would have been recovered. The radioactive dose was 
mainly excreted in the feces (62%) compared to 21% in the urine.  
The C max and AUC -time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC ∞) of liafensine increased slightly 
greater than in proportion to dose after single doses ranging from 0.025  to 5 mg. After once -daily 
doses (0.1 to 2  mg QD), the C max and AUC t of liafensine increased slightly less than proportional 
to dose on Day  14. There has been no evidence of time -dependent PK after repeat dosing of 
liafensine due to either autoinhibition or autoinduction. The observed degree of accumulation in 
liafensine is consistent with the elimination t ½ of liafensine.  
There were no apparent sex differences in the PK of liafensine and its active metabolite 821007 
in the completed Phase  1 studies. In the MAD study (CN162002), although the geometric means 
of liafensine C max and AUC t in the female subjects appeared to be lower than those in the male 
subjects in the 1  mg dose groups, there were marked overlaps in these PK parameters between 
the female and male subjects.  
The PK of liafensine in healthy elderly subjects was eval uated in a ketoconazole DDI study 
(CN162015). The elderly population in the study included 12 healthy male (N  = 8) and female 
(N = 4) subjects 65 to 85 years old, inclusive, and received a single 1  mg oral dose of liafensine 
administered alone. Dose -normal ized analysis showed that liafensine C max was 38% lower and 
AUC ∞ was 19% higher in the elderly subjects than the young subjects. t ½ was longer in the 
elderly compared to young subjects (84 hours vs 49 hours). No meaningful  difference was 
observed in the metabolite -to-parent C max ratio between the two populations. 821007 t ½ could not 
be characterized in the elderly due to insufficient sampling in the terminal phase of the profile. 
The C max and AUC ∞ values of liafensine were comparable in the elderly male and female 
subjects.  
Co-administration of liafensine with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole  (CN162015)  
increased C max and AUC ∞ of liafensine by 15% and 32%, respectively, compared to 
administration of liafensine alone.  Coadministration with ketoconazole also increased C max and 
AUC ∞ of 821007, the active metabolite of liafensine , by 16%  and 25%, respectively, compared 
to administration of liafensine alone. Because of the  observed small increases in liafensine 
exposures w hen co -administered with the potent CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole,  CYP3A4 
inhibitor s will not be excluded in this study.  
Co-administration of liafensine with rifampin (Study CN162017) decreased C max and AUC ∞ of 
liafensine by 34%  and, 66%, respectively, comp ared to administration of liafensine alone. 
Therefore,  in this study, liafensine should not be taken with strong inducers of CYP3A4 and 
those may lower liafensine exposure and reduce its effectiveness.

CONFIDENTIAL  1.2.4.  Clinical Studies of Liafensine  
The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) lists 14 completed studies in which liafensine was administered 
to 470 subjects in 11  Phase  1 studies and 1,264 subjects in 3 Phase  2b studies  including a 
rollover study . These studies are summarized in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
1.2.5.  Potential Risks and Benefits  
Please see the Investigator’s Brochure for additional discussion and information for the 
following section.  
A number of safety monitoring practices are being employed by this proto col (including, but not 
limited to, physical examination s, vital signs  including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and 
heart rate  monitoring at specified intervals, triplicate 12 -lead ECG s, clinical laboratory 
evaluations , and AE collection) in order to ensure the patient s’ safety.  
There is an anticipated health benefit for study patients from receipt of study drug. The previous 
Phase 2b studies conducted by Bristol -Myers Squibb ( BMS ) did not demonstrate clinical ly 
meaning ful and statistically significant improvement in depression symptoms  in general  TRD 
patient population . However, the pharmacogenomic analysis conducted by Denovo indicates a 
strong correlation between DGM4 status and symptom improvement in liafensine -treated 
patients , suggesting  that liafensine may provide significant treatment benefit in DGM4 -positive  
TRD  patients .

CONFIDENTIAL  3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design  
This study will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
Phase  2b trial to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of liafensine.  The study includes 
an up to 2 1-day screening period  (the screening period may exceed 21 days if a prolonged 
washout  is required) . 
Approximately 180 patients with TRD who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive either liafensine 1  mg QD, liafensine 2  mg QD, or placebo QD for 6 weeks. 
Approximately 150 randomized patients will be geno type GG for DGM4 (DGM4 -positive) and 
approximately 30 randomized patients will be genotype AA or AG for DGM4 (DGM4 -negative). 
DGM4 status (positive vs negative) of randomized patients will be blinded to the sites , patients , 
and sponsor . An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system will be used for blinding to 
DGM4 status, and to achieve the correct randomization ratio of DGM4 -positive:DGM4 -negative 
patients by randomly excluding most screened DGM4 -negative patients (~ 80%). Randomization 
will be stratified by DGM4 status (positive vs negative) and region (North America vs Other). 
Patients who complete the study or discontinue after randomization will h ave 2 post -study 
follow -up visits (14  days after the last administered dose of study drug, and 28  days after the last 
administered dose of study drug ); the 2nd follow -up visit will be conducted via phone call.  
During the study, safety will be assessed on t he basis of spontaneously reported AEs; the 
Discontinuation -Emergent Signs and Symptoms scale (DESS); physical, neurological, and 
psychiatric examinations (including the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C -SSRS]); 
vital signs  including orthostatic ch anges in blood pressure and heart rate ; weight; 12 -lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs); clinical laboratory test results; serum and urine pregnancy tests 
(females of childbearing potential only); and concomitant medication assessments. In addition to 
blood samp les collected for PK, additional blood samples may be collected for determination of 
plasma concentrations of liafensine and its primary metabolite in association with the evaluation 
of safety signals . 
The overall study design is shown in Figure  1. The schedule of study assessments is presented i n 
Table  1 with the clinical laboratory t ests shown in Table  3. 
To ensure the safety of patients enrolled in this study, an Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) will monitor data on an  ongoing basis  (Section  8.3.8 ). The IDMC will 
comprise individuals external to the sponsor  and will consist of at least one medical expert in the 
relevant therapeutic area, at least one hepatologist, and at least one statistician.

3.2. Methodology  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase  2b trial to assess the efficacy, 
safety, tolerability, and PK of liafensine. The primary endpoint is change in MADRS total score 
from baseline (Visit  3, Day  -1) to Visit  7 (Day  42) in DGM4 -positi ve patients. The primary 
analysis will be conducted to assess the superiority of liafensine treatment (combined liafensine 
1 mg QD and 2  mg QD doses) vs placebo in randomized patients who are DGM4 -positive.  
3.3. Study Duration and Follow -up 
The duration of part icipation for individual patients will be up to 91  days or longer, including an 
up to 21 -day screening period  (screening period may exceed 21  days if a prolonged washout is 
required), a 6-week double -blind treatment period, and 2  post-study follow -up visit s (at 14  days 
and 28  days after the last dose of study drug ); the 2nd follow -up visit will be conducted via phone 
call ( Figure  1). 

Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 38 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  3.4. Sample Size Justification  
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive liafensine 1  mg QD, liafensine 2  mg QD, or 
placebo QD. The primary analysis is to assess treatment difference in MADRS total score 
change from baseline (Visit  3, Day  -1) to Visit  7 (Day  42), between the combined liafensine 
1 mg QD and 2  mg QD doses vs placebo, in DGM4 -positive patients. A sample size of 
47 randomized DGM4 -positive patients per arm is sufficient to detect a 4.5 -unit difference 
between the combined liafensine 1  mg QD and 2  mg QD treatment groups and the placebo 
treatment group in the change in MADRS total score with 80% power at the 2 -sided 0.05 alpha 
level, assuming a standard deviation of 9 units.  
To compensate for potential loss of power due to randomized patients who do no t take at least 
one dose of study drug or who do not have a post-randomization efficacy evaluation (~5%), a 
total of approximately 150 DGM4 -positive patients (50 DGM4 -positive patients per arm) will be 
randomized.  
To examine trend in the total patient population and in the subgroup of DGM4 -negative patients 
in order to evaluate DGM4 as a potential biomarker for predicting response to liafensine, 
approximately 20% additional DGM4 -negative patients (10 per arm, total approximately  30) will 
also be  randomized. The sample size of 30 randomized patients in the DGM4 -negative group is 
not estimated based on formal statistics in terms of power and alpha level . 
Sample size re -estimation may be conducted if the percentage of missing data at Day 42 visit is  
higher than expected and/or if the observed variance is higher than the one assumed in the 
sample size estimation.  
3.5. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 180 patients will be enrolled in the study.  
3.6. Treatment Assignment  
Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized through an IRT  system in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either liafensine 1  mg QD, 
liafensine 2  mg QD, or placebo QD for 6 weeks.  
3.7. Criteria for Study Termination  
The sponsor may decide to terminate the study at any time. Furthermore, the sponsor will 
consider recommendations provided by an external IDMC with regards to study continuation, 
modification, and/or termination ( Section  7.6).

DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 45 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  3. Any psychopharmacologic drug (including antidepressants and over -the-counter 
medications to treat depression (eg, herb al medicines like St John’s Wort, or other local 
herbal medicines).  
4. Potent inducers of CYP3A4 (eg, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, or carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital).  
Permitted  concomitant treatments, provided they meet the specific requirements detailed 
below, during the study and during the indicated periods include:  
1. Up to 3 g/day paracetamol/acetaminophen.  
2. Non-psychopharmacologic drugs provided the dose and condition being treated have 
been relatively stable for at least 2 months prior to screening and bet ween screening and 
baseline (Day  -1) and are not expected to change meaningfully during the study.  
3. Soporific drugs may be used provided the dose and condition being treated have been 
relatively stable for at least 2 months prior to screening and between sc reening and 
baseline (Day  -1) and are not expected to change meaningfully during the study.  
4. Psychotherapy (including cognitive behavioral therapy) is permitted provided 
psychotherapy was initiated at least 2 months prior to screening and is expected to remain 
relatively stable during the study.  
5. Anxiolytic drugs which do not affect 5 -HT, norepinephrine, and dopamine activity may 
be used provided the dose and condition being treated have been relatively stable for at 
least 2 months prior to scr eening and between screening and baseline (Day  -1) and are 
not expected to change meaningfully during the study.  
Note 1: if a pro re nata (PRN) use has been established prior to the study, and not 
expected to change during the trial, this is considered sta ble treatment.  
Note 2 : Medication considered necessary for the patient’s safety and well -being may be 
given at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the appropriate sections of the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). If a psychopharmacologic medication that is 
otherwise prohibited is administered the study measurements such as MADRS and CGI 
should be collected prior to dosing when possible. If  any medication that is otherwise 
prohibited is administered to a patient, the investigator should inf orm the medical 
monitor prior to administration of medication when possible.  
Other restrictions include:  
1. Patients will be required to maintain their normal intake of xanthine -containing foods or 
beverages, and, if permitted, vitamin and herbal supplements,  during the study, including 
the screening and follow -up periods.  
2. Patients should not provide blood or plasma donations between screening and baseline 
(Day  -1), during the study and for 6  weeks after the last dose of study drug.

DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 46 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  5.4. Treatment Compliance  
Compli ance with study drug must be stressed and assessed at each visit.  Study drug compliance 
will be assessed by the investigator and/or study personnel at designated visits by direct 
questioning and recording tablet counts from the previously dispensed bottles  (ie, returned tablet 
counts).  In the events of poor compliance, eg , < 80%, investigator and/or study personnel should 
follow up closely with patients and make every effort to improve patients’ treatment compliance.  
All study drug dispensed and returned must be recorded in the Drug Accountability Log.  
The study site will keep a record of all drugs dispensed to and returned by patients throughout 
the study. Start and end dates of doses of study drug administered since the last dispensing visit 
will be recorded in the eCRFs (study drug dosage administration record) at visits specified in the 
table of assessments ( Table  1). Deviations from the prescr ibed dosage regimen should be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Each patient  should be instructed to return all study drug packaging and unused material to the 
study site at each visit. Study site personnel will destroy  unused medication  unless it is the site’s 
policy  to return to Denovo or its designee  at the end of the study . 
5.5. Randomization and Blinding  
DGM4 status (positive vs negative) of randomized patients will be blinded to the s ites, the 
patients, and sponsor . An IRT system will be used for blinding to DGM4 stat us, and to achieve 
the correct randomization ratio of DGM4 positive:DGM4 -negative patients by randomly 
excluding most screened DGM4 -negative patients (~8 0%). 
The study team from the s ponsor will also be blinded for DGM4 status of individual patients ; 
however, the sponsor will be informed of the total number of patients enrolled in the 
DGM4 -positive group by an independent unblinding team who supports the IDMC meetings in 
order to ensure the target enrollment is achieved in this group.  
Treatme nt randomization will be stratified by DGM4 status (positive vs negative) and region 
(North America vs Other). Treatment assignment is blinded to the study site, patients , and the 
sponsor.  
5.6. Emergency Treatment Unblinding  
Unblinding during the study is disco uraged and should only happen if knowledge of the patient’s 
study drug would affect subsequent treatment and such knowledge is essential for the clinical 
management of the patient. In such  a case, the investigator should contact the sponsor’s medical 
monitor before breaking the treatment code whenever possible. The treatment assignment shall 
only be shared, if necessary and feasible, with personnel involved in the clinical management of 
the patient. Personnel exclusively involved in the clinical trial condu ct, eg, study coordinators, 
study manager, and representatives from the contract research organization (CRO)/sponsor, shall 
remain blinded. The sponsor will be notified once the treatment code is broken and should 
remain blinded to the treatment assignment .

CONFIDENTIAL  7.2. Assessment of Efficacy  
The primary efficacy outcome measure is the change in MADRS total score fro m baseline 
(Visit  3, Day  -1) to Visit  7 (Day  42) in DGM4 -positive patients. Other efficacy assessments 
include CGI-S, CGI -I, and SDS. 
The overall schedule of efficacy assessments is provided in  Table  1. Note that CGIs should be 
completed only after the Patient Rated Depression and Functioning Checklist (PRDF Checklist) 
has been completed as instructed.  
Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Sca le (MADRS ) 
The Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10 -item clinician -administered 
scale, designed to be particularly sensitive to antidepressant treatment effects in patients with 
major depression  (Montgom ery 1979 ). Each MADRS item is rated on a 0 to 6 scale.  The 
MADRS total score is calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores; the total score can 
range from 0 to 60.  Higher MADRS scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms.  
A structured interview guide for Montgomery -Asberg (SIGMA) will be provided.  
Clinical Global Impressions Scale -Severity (CGI -S) 
The CGI -Severity (CGI -S) asks the clinician one question: “Considering your total clinical 
experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?” which is 
rated on the following seven -point scale: 1  = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline mentally ill; 
3 = mildly ill; 4  = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7  = among the mos t 
extremely ill patients  (Guy 1976 ). 
This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 
seven days. Clearly, symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week; the score should r eflect 
the average severity level across the seven days.  
Clinical Global Impressions Scale -Improvement (CGI -I) 
The CGI -Improvement (CGI -I) is similarly simple in its format  (Guy 1976 ). Each time the 
patient is seen aft er medication has been initiated, the clinician compares the patient's overall 
clinical condition to the one-week  period just prior to the initiation of medication  use (the 
so-called baseline visit). The CGI -S score obtained at the baseline (initiation) vi sit serves as a 
good basis for making this assessment. Again, only the following one query is rated on a 
seven -point scale: “Compared to the patient's condition at admission to the project (prior to 
medication initiation ), this patient's condition is: 1  = very much improved since the initiation of 
treatment; 2  = much improved; 3  = minimally improved; 4  = no change from baseline (the 
initiation of treatment); 5  = minimally worse; 6  = much worse; 7  = very much worse since the 
initiation of treatment.”  
The CGI -I score generally tracks with the CGI -S such that improvement in one follows the other. 
Anchors for scoring, however, are quite different, and the CGI -I is based upon changes from the 
initiation of treatment in contrast to changes from the preceding week of treatment. 
Consequently, the two CGI scores can occasionally be dissociated such that a clinician may 
notice changes in the CGI -I relative to baseline despite no recent changes in the overall CGI 
severity score or vice versa .

DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 52 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  Patient Rated Depression and Functioning Checklist (PRDF Checklist)  
PRDF Checklist is used to assess overall  depression symptoms and the psychosocial impact over 
the last week. It will be completed by patients and reviewed with the clinician before finalizing.  
The post-baseline entry must be compared to baseline checklist entry to refresh the knowledge of 
patient’s baseline condition . The checklist must be administered prior to the administration of 
CGIs. 
Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  
The SDS will be used to asses s functional impairment in three major life domains: work, social 
life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities ( Sheehan 2008 ). It is a five -item scale 
that will be completed by the participant. Thre e items use a Likert scale with a 10 -point range 
(0 / Moderately to 10 / Extremely) and two items are open -ended (eg, “On how many days in the 
last week did you…? ”). The scale is expected to take about 5 minutes to complete . 
7.3. Other Assessment s 
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale  – 17 Item  (HAMD -17) 
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  – 17 Item  (HAMD -17) is used to quantify the severity 
of symptoms of depression and is one of the most widely used and accepted instruments for 
assessing depressio n (Hamilton 1960 ). The standard version of the HAMD -17 is designed to be 
administered by a trained c linician, and it contains 17 items rated on either a 3 - or 5-point scale, 
with the sum of all items making up the total score. The HAMD -17 may be a useful scale for 
cognitively impaired patients who have difficulty with self -report instruments.  
The HAMD -17 may be used to monitor the patient's progress during treatment, after the 
diagnosis of major depres sion has been established. This clinician -administered scale exists in 
several versions, ranging from 6 to 31 items; answers by patients are scored from 0  to 2 or 0  to 4 
and tallied to obtain an overall score. A decrease of 50% or more in the HAMD -17 score  is often 
considered to indicate a positive treatment response, whereas a score of 7 or less is considered 
equivalent to a remission.  
In the current study, the HAM D-17 is utilized for eligibility only  at screening and baseline  visit. 
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Antidepressant Treatment Response 
Questionnaire (ATRQ) (5 -year version)  
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(ATRQ) (5 -year version) is a self -rated scale used to determin e treatment resistance in major 
depressive disorder (MDD) ( Chandler 2010 ). The MGH ATRQ defines a treatment period for an 
adequate duration of treatment and provides specific operational  criteria for adequate dosa ge for 
each of the most commonly used antidepressants.  
Placebo Response Propensity Scale (PRPS)  
The Placebo Response Propensity Scale (PRPS) was developed to assess the conceptual 
constructs which may influence placebo response in a clinical trial.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.4. Pharma cokinetics  
Blood samples will be collected for determination of concentrations of liafensine and its primary 
metabolite  on Day 28 (Visit  6) and on Day  42 (Visit  7) prior to dose administration . The time of 
last dose and time of blood collection will be rec orded.  
If the patient discontinues before Day  42 (Visit  7), a blood sample will be collected for PK on 
the last day the patient takes a full dose of study drug or as soon as possible thereafter, but within 
three  days after the last dose in any case. When p ossible, and if medically appropriate, blood 
samples should be collected for PK from patients who experience a serious adverse event (SAE) 
or overdose.  
7.5. Pharmacogen omics  
Blood will be collected for DGM4 assessment  by central laboratory . Any remaining sample s not 
used for DGM4 assessment will  be stored for potential future biomarker/pharmacogenomic 
research as described below.  
The DGM4 biomarker status for each patient will be blinded to the sponsor, investigative site,  
and patient.  Blood will also be collected to be stored at a contracted laboratory for future  
biomarker/pharmacogenomic research.  
The biomarker/pharmacogenomic research includes studying genetic  variations such as  
polymorphisms on serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine transp orters, as well as  CYP450 
genes ), which may help to understand  the varied responses due to  liafensine among different 
patients . The blood samples can also be used  for developing  DGM4 in vitro diagnostic (IVD) 
assay  which will be used as a  companion diagnos tic in the future.  
To protect patients’ confidentiality, the stored biospecimens and data generated from them will  
be coded with the patients’ study number. Biospecimens will be stored indefinitely unless a time  
limit is required by local regulations or et hical requirements. Patients can withdraw their consent  
for the use of their biospecimens at any time by making a request to the investigator, in which  
case any remaining biospecimen will be destroyed; data already generated from the  
biospecimens will cont inue to be stored to protect the integrity of existing analyses. Results  
generated from the biospecimen will not be provided to the patients (unless required by local  
regulations), and their family members, the investigators, or other physicians. Patients will not  be 
compensated if the use of the biospecimens results in commercially viable products.  
Instructions for sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in a  
separate document.  
7.6. Assessment of Safety  
Safety will be assessed on the basis of spontaneously reported AEs; the DESS scale; physical, 
neurological, and psychiatric examinations (including C -SSRS); vital signs  including orthostatic 
changes in blood pressure and heart rate ; weight; 12 -lead ECGs; clinical laborat ory test results; 
serum and urine pregnancy tests (females of childbearing potential only); and concomitant 
medication assessments. Safety assessments in addition to those specified may be performed to 
ensure patient safety if judged appropriate by the inv estigator.  
See Table  1 for the overall schedule of safety assessments.

DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 54 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  Psychiatric assessments  will be performed by a psychiatrist or trained and certifi ed clinical staff 
member , and neurologic assessments will be performed by an experienced clinician . 
Patients fulfilling Hy’s law, defined as [ALT or AST ≥  3 × ULN] and [ TBL  ≥ 2 × ULN], in the 
absence of significant increase in ALP and in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that 
explains the increase in total bilirubin, will be discontinued, with medical follow -up as 
appropriate.  
An IDMC will be established to monitor data on an ongoing basis to ensure the continuing safety 
of patients enrolled in this s tudy (Section  8.3.8 ). The IDMC will comprise of individuals external 
to the sponsor  and will consist of at least one medical expert in the relevant therapeutic area, at 
least one hepatologist, and at least one st atistician. The IDMC’s responsibilities, authorities, and 
procedures, with details of decision -making guidance and dissemination of the results, will be 
documented in the IDMC charter.  
7.6.1.  Safety Parameters  
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protoc ol-required tests and procedures are 
completed. Safety assessments will include collection of AEs, vital signs  including supine and 
standing blood pressure and heart rate , physical examinations, neurological examinations, 
electrocardiograms, laboratory tes ts, and concomitant medications.  
7.6.1.1.  Adverse Events  
Assessment of AEs will include the type, incidence, severity , timing, seriousness, and 
relatedness.  
Adverse events reporting requirements are provided in Section  7.6.2 . 
7.6.1.2.  Medical History and Demographics  
Demographic and baseline variables include the following: age, sex, ethnicity, and race. Other 
baseline characteristics include the following: relevant medi cal history and neuro -oncology 
history.  
7.6.1.3.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurement of temperature, supine (after at least 5 min  rest) and 
standing ( after1 min and 3 min  standing ), blood pressure (BP)  and heart rate.  
7.6.1.4.  Physical Examination  and Neurological Examination  
The physical and neurological assessments will be performed by an experienced clinician.  
The physical examination  includ es height and weight, and also examination of the heart, lungs, 
and abdomen  at a minimum.  
The neurological examination include s evaluation of cranial nerves, muscle strength, tone and 
bulk, reflexes, coordination, sensory function and gait.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.1.5.  Psychiatric Assessments  
Psychiatric assessments will be performed by a psychiatrist or appropriately qualifi ed clinical 
staff member .  
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) was designed to quantify the severity of 
suicidal ideation and behavior  (Posner 2011 ). C-SSRS is a measure used to identify and assess 
individuals at risk for suicide. Questions are phrased  for use in an interview format, but can be 
completed as a self‐report measure if necessary. C‐SSRS measur es four constructs: the severity 
of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior,  and lethality. It includes “stem questions,” which 
if endorsed, prompt additional follow‐up questions to obtain more information. There are four 
versions of the scale availa ble, including: 1)  Baselin e/screening  version, which allows 
practitioners  to gather  a lifetime  and recent 12 months history  of suicidal  ideation  and/or  
behavior ; 2) Since Last  Visit  version  for assessment  of suicidal  thoughts  and behaviors  since 
C-SSRS was last administered ; 3) Screen version, a shortened version of the full form  
(3-6 questions)  most commonly used in clinical triage settings ; 4) Risk Assessment Page, which 
provides a checklist of protective and risk factors of suicidality.  
Discontinuatio n-Emergent Signs and Symptoms scale (DESS)  
The DESS scale will be used to monitor patients for discontinuation symptoms  (Rosenbaum 
1998 ). It includes 43  signs or symptoms for which the patient indicates whether there has been 
any change since  their last visit  – indicating new symptom, old symptom but worse, old 
symptom but improved,  old symptom but unchanged, symptom not present. The DESS total 
score is calculated as the  count of items with new symptoms or old symptoms  but worse. The 
total score can range  from 0  to 43. 
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)  
The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) is a structured diagnostic interview 
designed to meet the need for an accurate psychiatric int erview in multicenter trials, with a short 
administration time (~26 minutes) ( Sheehan 1998 ). The MINI was developed to explore 
17 disorders according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual diagnostic criteria, focusing on the 
existence of current disorders. For each disorder, one or two screening questions rule out the 
diagnosis when answered negatively. Probes for severity, disability or medically explained 
symptoms are not explored symptom -by-symptom . 
7.6.1.6.  Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiogram (ECG): 12 lead (with a 10 second rhythm strip) tracing will be used for all 
ECGs.  It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the standard intervals 
automatically. 12-lead ECG recordings will be performed in triplicate (at approximately  
1-minute intervals between each of the three recordings)  at baseline, and single  ECG  for rest of 
visits . 
QT corrected by Fridericia’s formula is recommended: QTcF  = QT/RR0.33.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.1.8.  Laboratory Abnormalities  
An increase of serum aminotransferases of >  3 x ULN must be followed by repeat testing of all 
four of the AT  serum measures (ALT, AST, ALP, and TBL) within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the 
abnormalities and to determine if they are increasing or decreasing. In the urgent event that a 
local laboratory must be used, the test results must include the normal range and units. These 
results must be collected on a CRF and entered in the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system .  
For patients with ALT or AST >  8 × ULN, ALT or AST >  5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks, ALT 
or AST >  3 × ULN and TBL >  2 × ULN, or ALT or AST >  3 × ULN with the appearance of 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (>  5%), treatment must  be discontinued and the patient should be monitored , at a 
minimum, weekly until liver chemistry results (ALT,  AST,  ALP , and bilirubin) resolve, stabilize, 
or return to baseline values.  
In all the above situations involving elevations in liver enzymes, every attempt should be made 
to obtain the following:  
• Viral hepatitis serology including:  
o Hepatitis A immunoglobulin M ( IgM) antibody  
o Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antibody (IgM)  
o Hepatitis C RNA  
• Blood sample for plasma PK analysis. The date and time of the PK blood sample 
collection and dates and times of the 2 previous doses  of study medication must be 
recorded.  
• Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK)  
• Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin is ≥  1.5 × ULN  
• Record of the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis, including 
fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomit ing, abdominal pain, jaundice, fever, or rash on 
the AE report form.  
• Record of the use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other 
over-the-counter medications, putative hepatotoxins, or alcohol on the concomitant 
medication form.  
• If these are identified, consultation with a gastrointestinal or hepatology specialist should 
be considered.  
The following are required for patients with ALT or AST ≥  3 × ULN and total bilirubin 
≥ 1.5 × ULN but are optional for other liver chemistry results:  
• Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, and Type  I anti -liver kidney 
microsomal antibodies  
• Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography scan)  
to evaluate liver disease

CONFIDENTIAL  Hy’s Law  
Hepatic function abnormality defin ed by an increase in AST and/or ALT to ≥  3 × ULN 
concurrent with an increase in TBL  to ≥ 2 × ULN but without increase in alkaline phosphatase 
(ie, ALP <  2 × ULN) meets the criteria for Hy’s Law and raises the concern for drug -induced 
liver injury (DILI) wh en no other cause of the abnormal laboratory results is identified. Follow -
up investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by the investigational site to determine 
whether the findings are reproducible and/or whether there is objective evidence that clearly 
supports causation by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with distended 
gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational product.  
Cases meeting Hy’s Law are considered an AESI and must  be reported as SAEs. Study drug 
should be permanently discontinued for a Hy’s Law case.  
7.6.1.9.  Pregnancy Screen  
Serum pregnancy tests are required for female patients of childbearing potential. Serum 
pregnancy testing will occur at the timepoints indicated in  Table  1. 
If the patient is found to be pregnant, the patient will be withdrawn from study treatment 
immediately and the sponsor or sponsor representative no tified within 24 hours of awareness. If 
the patient’s partner is found to be pregnant the same procedure of reporting and follow up 
should be followed but the patient can continue study treatment.  
7.6.2.  Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
7.6.2.1.  Definition of  an Adverse Event  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
patient s, whether or not considered drug related. It can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including laboratory abnormalities), symptom, or d isease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug, regardless of causal relationship to the drug.  
Examples of AEs include the following:  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -
existing condition including eit her an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the 
condition.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication.  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results if:  
o Accompanied by clinical sympto ms 
o Leads to a discontinuation of study treatment or change in study dosing  
o Requires significant additional concomitant medication or other therapy  
o Requires additional diagnostic testing (does not include repeat testing of an abnormal 
test) or medical inter vention (does not include replacing of electrolytes)  
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing diseases(s) or conditions(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen are not considered AEs.

DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 59 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious a dverse event ( SAE ) is an AE that meets at least one of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (AE that places the patient at immediate risk of death from the reaction 
as it occurred; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurre d in a more severe form, 
might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (see 
exceptions below)  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability to con duct normal life functions)  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they ma y jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home,  blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in patient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
Hospitalization  
Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent healthcare facility or any prolongation of an existing admission. An emergency room 
visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the 
emergency room visit should be assessed for medical importance.  
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization due to the following reasons or conditions 
should not be reported as an SAE. Examples include  but not limited to : 
• Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with the development 
of a new AE or with a worsening of the pre -existing condition  
• Social, administrative for insurance reimbursement, or convenience admission  
• Hospitalization for elective procedures for the treatment of pre -existing conditions (eg, 
hip replacement for pre -existi ng osteoarthritis)  
Admission to rehabilitation facilities, respite care, hospice facilities, nursing homes, skilled 
nursing facilities, and same -day surgeries are not considered hospitalization.  
7.6.2.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Potential liver injury, ie , suspected and/or confirmed Hy’s Law, DILI cases will be assessed as 
adverse events of special interest ( AESI ) and must be reported as SAE . Information of abnormal 
laboratory test results including the course and evolvement, clinical signs and symptoms, 
detailed medical history and concurrent medication, history and current lifestyle including 
alcoholic assumption, history of exposure to environmental chemical agents will be used to 
assess the case(s).

DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 60 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.2.4.  Relationship to Study Treatment  
Liafensine  is an inves tigational medicinal product (IMP). The causality relationship to liafensine  
for all AEs (serious and non -serious) will be assessed by the investigator. The causal relationship 
of an AE to the study treatment  will be assessed as either:  
Related  
There is as  at least a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE (ie, there is evidence or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and AE)  
Unrelated  
• Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of drug  
• Does not appea r to worsen when the drug is re -administered  
• There is not a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE  
• An alternate etiology has been established, ie, the AE is more likely explained by another 
cause (eg, other study treatments or procedures, under lying medical conditions, 
concomitant medications, etc) than the study treatment . 
7.6.2.5.  Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events should only be recorded by an investigator or by a healthcare provider qualified 
by training and experience. Patients should be asked in an open -ended manner about the 
occurrence of AEs. All AEs are recorded in the electronic CRF  (eCRF) . 
It is generally not necessary to record both a diagnosis and its associated symptoms and 
laboratory abnormalities. For example, if “acute renal failure”  is recorded as an AE, “creatinine 
5 mg/dL” need not be recorded.  
If an AE necessitates a procedure, the description of the event (eg, appendicitis) rather than the 
procedure (appendectomy) should be listed as the AE.  
Any ongoing AEs and SAEs should be fol lowed during study visits until resolution, or until the 
event is otherwise explained or judged by the investigator as stable or no longer clinically 
significant (unless the patient  is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent).  
7.6.2.6.  Severity Assessment of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be reported, and severity graded, according to the following guidelines:  
Mild  Awareness of signs or symptoms but easily tolerated  
Moderate  Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal everyday activities  
Severe  Incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal activities  
 
In the event of the change in severity, the existing AE should be updated accordingly.

DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 61 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  7.6.2.7.  Reporting Advers e Events  
All AEs regardless of causality will be recorded from the time a patient signs an ICF and through 
Follow -up period.  
All SAEs regardless of causality will be recorded from the time a patient signs an ICF until 
30 days after the last administration of study treatment. If SAEs are determined to be related to 
the study treatment  by the investigators, these SAEs need to be reported beyond 30  days.  
7.6.2.8.  Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
If an SAE occurs, the sponsor or designee is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator’s 
awareness of the event. The time frame also applies to follow -up information on a previously 
reported SAE and pregnancies. This can be done by completing SAE entry through eCRF in the 
EDC. In the event of EDC outage, the investigator must complete the paper SAE reporting form 
and email or fax it to the sponsor or designee.  
Investigators may be requested to obtain additional information on an SAE to allow for a 
complete assessment of the event.  
Adve rse event (serious and non -serious) reporting to regulatory authorities, including Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs), will be carried out in accordance with 
applicable local regulations by the investigator, sponsor or designee.  
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
7.6.3.  Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy is not considered an adverse event. However, any patient  who becomes pregnant 
during the study must be withdrawn from the study immediately. The investigator  must report all 
pregnancies in the patient  or partner of the patient  within 24 hours of the investigator becoming 
aware of the event.  
Pregnancy and maternal information will be collected until completion or termination of 
pregnancy including outcome of pr egnancy and details of birth (if applicable).  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE ( eg. ectopic pregnancy, 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly/birth 
defect) the investigator should  follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.

CONFIDENTIAL  8. STATISTICS  
Additional details of the analyses will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) which 
will be finalized prior to breaking the blind.  
8.1. Study Design  
This study will be conducted as a multicenter , a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
Phase  2b trial to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of liafensine. The primary 
endpoint is change in MADRS total score from baseline (Visit  3, Day  -1) to Visit  7 (Day  42) in 
DGM4 -positive pat ients. The primary analysis will be conducted to assess liafensine treatment 
effect for combined liafensine 1  mg QD and 2  mg QD doses vs placebo in randomized patients 
who are DGM4 -positive.  
8.2. Determination of Sample Size and Statistical Rationale  
Eligible p atients will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive liafensine 1  mg QD, liafensine 2  mg QD, or 
placebo QD. The primary analysis is to assess treatment difference in MADRS total score 
change from baseline (Visit  3, Day  -1) to Visit  7 (Day  42) between the combined l iafensine 
1 mg QD and 2  mg QD doses vs placebo, in DGM4 -positive patients. A sample size of 
forty -seven  (47) randomized DGM4 -positive patients per arm is sufficient to detect a 4.5 -unit 
difference between the combined liafensine 1  mg QD and 2  mg QD treatment groups  and the 
placebo treatment group in the change in MADRS total score from baseline to Visit  7 with 80% 
power at the 2 -sided 0.05  alpha level, assuming a standard deviation of 9 units.  
To compensate for potential loss of power due to randomiz ed patients who do not take at least 
one dose of study drug or who do not have a post randomization efficacy evaluation (~5%), a 
total of approximately 150 DGM4 -positive patients ( 50 DGM4 -positive patients per arm) will be 
randomized.  
To examine trend in t he total patient  population and in the subgroup of DGM4 -negative patients 
in order to evaluate DGM4 as a potential biomarker for predicting response to liafensine,  
approximately 20% additional DGM4 -negative patients (10 per arm , total 30 ) will also be 
randomized . The sample size of 30 randomized patients in the DGM4 negative group is not 
estimated based on formal statistics in terms of power and alpha level.  
The sample size may be re -estimated/re -adjusted if more  than expected missing data are 
observed  at Day 42 .  
8.3. Statistic al Methods  
8.3.1.  Analysis Population  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study 
drug and  had a post -randomization efficacy evaluation. The FAS population will be analyzed by 
treatment randomized regardless of the actual treatment received.  The primary and secondary 
efficacy results of the study will be based on analysis in FAS patient s with posit ive DGM4 
biomarker.  Safety Population includes all patients who took at least one dose of study  drug. The 
Safety population will be analyzed by the actual treatment received  regardless of treatment 
randomized . 
Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 63 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  8.3.2.  Primary Estimand  
The primary estimand, the mai n clinical quantity of interest to be estimated in the study, is 
defined by the following three components:  
• Population: patient s with treatment -resistant depression with  the DGM4 -positive  
biomarker  
• Endpoint: change in MADRS total score from baseline to Day  42 
• Measure of Intervention: the effect of the initially randomized treatment that would have 
been observed had all patient s remained on their treatment throughout the double -blind 
phase  
The primary analysis will be based on the full analysi s set, as described above , and the MADRS 
total scores collected during the double -blind  treatment period.  
8.3.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in MADRS total score from baseline (Visit  3, 
Day -1) to Day  42 (Visit  7). The primary efficacy analysis will be performed in DGM4 -positive 
patients at 2-sided significance level of 0.05 using a mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) that includes the fixed effects of treatment, visit (categorical covariate), treatment -by-
visit interaction, baseline MADRS total score (continuous covariate), and region. An 
unstructured variance -covariance matrix will be used. The least -squares (LS) mean change in 
MADRS total score at Day  42 from baseline for the combined liafensine treatment a rms 
(1 mg QD and 2  mg QD) and placebo arm will be estimated from the MMRM model. The 
treatment effect for the combined liafensine treatment arms vs placebo will be estimated using 
the LS  mean difference at Day  42 from the MMRM model. The comparison of the change in 
MADRS total score from baseline to Day  42 between each of the 2  liafensine treatment arms and 
placebo will be carried out using the same approach.  The key s econdary efficacy endpoint  for 
this study i s the change in CGI -S from baseline (Visit  3, Day -1) to Day  42 (Visit  7), in DGM4 -
positive patients.  
Other secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints  include the CGI-I, SDS, response (defined 
as ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in MADRS total score at Day  42), and remission (defined 
as MADRS total score ≤  10 at Day  42), in DGM4 -positive patients.  CGI-S, CGI -I, and SDS  will 
be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the primary efficacy endpoint.  Response rate, 
remission rate, and corresponding 95%  confidence interval ( CI) for each treatment group will be 
derived by using Clopper -Pearson method. The comparison of response rate and remission rate 
between treatment groups will be carried out using the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel ( CMH ) test. 
Subscales , individual items, and domains of endpoints will also be analyzed in an exploratory 
manner, using the same MMRM model as for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The change in MADRS total score from baseline in DGM4 -negative patients will be analyzed 
using the same approach as described for the primary endpoint analysis in the DGM4 -positive 
patients. The LS  mean of the change in MADRS total score for each treatment group and the 
treatment difference in DGM4 -negative patients will be estimated. The treatment effects between 
the DGM4positive and ne gative patients will be compared primarily in descriptive fashion to 
examine the trend, and may be evaluated by including the interaction of DGM4 status and 
treatment group in the mixed model.

DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 64 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  8.3.3.1.  Type I Error Control for Multiple Comparisons  
The family -wise t ype I error rate will be controlled at a fixed 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 using 
a closed  testing procedure for multiple dose comparisons and multiple endpoint comparisons in 
DGM4 -positive patients  (Marcus 1976 ). In th e closed testing procedure, the average effect of 
1 mg and 2  mg dose groups will be  first compared with the placebo group  on change in 
MADRS total score from baseline to Day  42 in DGM4 -positive subjects . If the one -sided 
p-value was ≤  0.025, the n the  one-sided p -values are calculated for the comparisons of  1 mg 
dose vs placebo and 2  mg dose vs placebo , respectively . If both individual p -values are 
≤ 0.025, a significant treatment effect is declared for both dose groups. If only one p -value is 
≤ 0.025, a significant treatment effect is declared for the corresponding dose group. All other 
efficacy endpoints will not be controlled for multiplicity with nominal p -values provided for 
the exploratory purpose only. Addit ional details will be specified in the S AP. 
8.3.4.  Safety Analyses  
The s afety analyses will be conducted in the safety population, which includes all randomized 
patients who have received at least one dose of study drug. The safety population will be 
analyzed by the  actual treatment received regardless of treatment randomized.  
Adverse events will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) classification system. Listings will include the verbatim term , preferred 
term, and system organ class. The incidence and severity of treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) will be summarized by treatment. Vital signs  including supine ( after at least 5 min  rest) 
and standing ( after 1 min and 3 min  standing ), blood pressure and h eart rate  and heart rate , 
weight, ECG, clinical laboratory evaluation, DESS scale , and C -SSRS data will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics, by visit and by treatment.  
Safety and tolerability data will be summarized descriptively, including tables, l istings, and 
graphs, as appropriate. Unless otherwise stated, descriptive summary statistics for continuous 
variables will include number (N), mean (ie, arithmetic mean), standard deviation (SD), 
minimum, median, and maximum. Descriptive summary statistics  for categorical data will 
include frequency and proportion.  
All data will be presented by treatment regimen.  
Individual data for vital signs  including supine (after at least 5 min  rest) and standing ( after 
1 min and 3 min  standing ), blood pressure and heart rate , weight, clinical laboratory measures , 
and ECG assessments will be listed and summarized for any potentially clinically important 
(PCI) values according to predetermined PCI criteria.  
There will be no imputation (substitution) for missing data u nless explicitly specified otherwise 
in this protocol or in the statistical analysis plan.  
8.3.5.  Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma concentrations of l iafensine and its metabolite will be listed by subject and time of 
collection. A population PK analysis of plasma concentr ations of liafensine and its primary 
metabolite will be performed using a nonlinear mixed -effects modeling approach. The analysis 
will evaluate the effects of age, sex, ethnicity, and other covariates on the PK profile of 
liafensine.  This analysis will be reported separately.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.3.6.  Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses will be considered for gender, ethnicity, and region, and may  be explored 
for other factors (such as age and  baseline severity in term of MADRS  total score). Summary 
statistics will be provided for efficacy measures by treatment arm for each subgroup.  
8.3.7.  Statistical Analysis Plan  
Additional details of the analyses will be provided in the statistical analysis plan which will be 
finalized prior to unblinding . 
8.3.8.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC will be established to monitor data on an ongoing basis to ensure the continuing safety 
of patients enrolled in this study. The IDMC will comprise individuals external to the sponsor  
and will consist of at least one medical expert in the relevant therapeutic area, at least one 
hepatologist, and at least one statistician. The IDMC’s responsibilities, authorities, and 
procedures, with details of decision -making guidance and disseminatio n of the results, will be 
documented in the IDMC charter.

CONFIDENTIAL  9. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/ DOCUMENTS  
9.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a patient into the study, a representative of Denovo will 
visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Denovo or its representatives. This will be 
documented in a Clinical Trial/Stu dy Agreement between Denovo and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Denovo or representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that fac ilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform source data ve rification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient 
(eg, clinic charts, electronic medical record, shadow charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Denovo.  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Denovo and those S AEs that met criteria for reporting have 
been forwarded to the IRB/IEC.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
9.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Denovo, a regulator y authority, an IRB, or an IEC may visit the

DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 70 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  Investigators must:  
1. Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the 
language in which th e patient is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The 
language must be non -technical and easily understood.  
2. Allow time necessary for patient to inquire about the details of the study.  
3. Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated  by the patient and by the person 
who conducted the informed consent discussion , and provide a copy of the signed 
consent to the patient . 
4. Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of the written ICF and any 
other information to be provided to  the patients, prior to the beginning of the study, and 
after any revisions are completed for new information.  
5. Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that 
is relevant to the patient's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the 
investigator, should fully inform the patient of all pertinent aspects of the study and of 
any new information relevant to the patient's willingness to continue participation in the 
study. This communication should be documented.  
The consent form must also include a statement that Denovo and regulatory authorities have 
direct access to patient records.  
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study patients are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests o f science and society.  
11.5. Patient Confidentiality  
The confidentiality of records that could identify patients must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements, the patients' signed ICF 
and, in the US, the patients’ signed HIPAA Authorization.  
All clinical information is confidential, but data generated for this study must be available for 
inspection on request to representatives of the US FDA, other national or local regulatory or 
health authorities , Denovo representatives, and the associated IRB/IEC.  
All records must be kept in a secured area.  
11.6. Patient Recruitment  
Advertisements approved by IRBs/IECs and investigator databases may be used as recruitment 
procedures. However, Denovo will have an opport unity to review and approve the content of any 
study recruitment materials directed to potential study patients before such materials are used.  
11.7. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or 
ICH GCP  
Progress reports and notifications of  serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB 
or IEC according to local regulations and guidelines.  
Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 71 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  12. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD  KEEPING  
12.1. Data/Document  
The investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the 
study and the distribution of study treatment are complete, accurate, filed, and retained. 
Examples of source documents include hospital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory 
notes, memoranda, patient’s diaries or evaluation checklists, dispensing records, recorded data 
from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate 
copies, microfiche, X -ray film and reports, records kept at the pharmacy and the laboratories.  
12.2. Data Management  
Data will be collected  via eCRF. The term “case report form” includes as applicable paper forms 
and/or electronic data capture screens or forms for studies that utilize electronic data capture. For 
randomized patients, all and only data for the procedures and assessments specif ied in this 
protocol and required by the case report forms should be submitted on the appropriate eCRF 
(unless transmitted to the sponsor or a designee electronically, eg, laboratory data). Data from 
some procedures required by the protocol, such as physic al exams or some types of laboratory 
tests, will be recorded only on the source documents. Additional procedures and assessments 
may be performed as part of the investigator’s institution or medical practice standard of care. 
Data for unscheduled or additi onal assessments should remain in the patient’s medical record 
and should not be recorded on eCRFs unless specifically requested.  
The eCRF must be completed and signed by the investigator or authorized delegate from the 
study staff. This also applies to re cords for those patients who fail to complete the study or are 
randomized and never treated. If a patient stops dosing or terminates from the study, the dates 
and reasons must be noted on the eCRF.  
All paper forms should be typed or filled out using indeli ble ink and must be legible. Errors 
should be crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change initialed and 
dated by the investigator or his or her authorized delegate. Any discrepancies in the data will be 
brought to the attention  of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary. 
Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database. An audit trail within the system will 
track all changes to the data.  
The investigator should ensure the accuracy, comple teness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported to the sponsor in the eCRF and in all required reports.  
12.3. Inspection of Records  
Denovo will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of 
monitoring any aspect of the study. The investigator should understand that source documents 
for this study should be made available to appropriately qualified personnel from Denovo 
Quality Assurance (or designee), or to health authority inspectors after appropriate notification.  
The investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study treatment  
stocks, drug accountability records, patient charts and study source documents, and other records 
relative to study conduct. The verification of the eCRF data mu st be by direct inspection of 
source documents.  
Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 72 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  Upon request, the investigator will supply Denovo (or designee) with any required background 
data from the study documentation or clinic records. This is particularly important when eCRFs 
(if paper) are illeg ible or when errors in data transcription are suspected. In case of special 
problems or governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have 
access to the complete study records, provided that patient confidentiality is prot ected.  
12.4. Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should 
be classified into two separate catego ries as follows: (1)  investigator’s study file and (2)  patient 
clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain as applicable the protocol and protocol amendments, 
eCRFs, query forms, IRB/IEC and governmental approval with corresponden ce, sample 
informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other 
appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Patient clinical source documents (usually predefined by the project to record key efficacy and 
safety parameters  independent of the eCRFs) may include , but are not limited to,  patient 
hospital/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original laboratory 
reports, ECG, electroencephalogram, computed tomography /magnetic resonance imaging scan , 
bone scan, X -ray, pathology and special assessment reports, signed ICFs, patient diaries, 
consultant letters, and patient screening and enrollment logs.  
The investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least the latest of 
2 years following the marketing application approval date for the study treatment in the 
indication being investigated, 2  years after the investigation is completed or discontinued, or for 
a time consistent with local regulatory requirements. After that period of time, the documents 
may be destroyed subject to local regulations with prior written permission from the sponsor. If 
the investigator wants to assign the study records to another party or move them to another 
location, the sponsor must be notified in advan ce. 
If the investigator cannot guarantee the archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor to 
store these in a sealed container outside of the study site so that they can be returned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued 
care of the patient, appropriate copies should be made for storing outside of the study site.

Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 78 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  1. GUIDANCE TO STUDY SITES ON STUDY AND 
PATIENT MANAGEMENT IN CASE OF A PUBLIC  
HEALTH EMERGENCY  
In the case of a public  health  emergency,  Denovo  institutes  minimum  study  requirements,  in the 
event  of travel  restriction,  to safeguard  the rights,  welfare,  and safety  of study  subjects  and 
investigative  site staff.  These  measures  align  with the current  guidance  issued  the US FDA in 
March 2020 and updated 30 August 2021 ( FDA 2021 ) in regard  to the impact  of COVID -19 on 
the management  of clinical  trials.  
Also addressed are issues in study conduct that may be impacted by a public health emergency 
such as patient visits, documentation of deviations to the protocol , and recording of data. 
Changes that may be made to the protocol and clinical trial conduct as a result of any pub lic 
health emergency are to be considered temporary and will only remain in effect until a future 
Administrative Letter to Investigators notifies study sites to resume study conduct in accordance 
with the full protocol and normal practices.  
Where  feasible,  sites should  continue  to follow  the full schedule  of assessments.  All assessments  
missed  as a result  of any public health emergency, including COVID -19, will be captured  in 
the CRFs.  
Adjustments to Visit Windows and Study Assessments  
Study assessments associated with ±  3-day visit windows are assigned a ±  5-day window. Visits 
conducted within the expanded window are not considered protocol deviations. Visits outside of 
the expanded window may be considered protocol deviations. Data should be  recorded on the 
CRF associated with the nominal visit day.  
Study procedures that cannot be conducted due to institutional restrictions will not be reported as 
protocol deviations if the sponsor is made aware in advance on a case -by-case basis. Such 
proced ures may include PK blood sample collection and ECGs.  
Remote Patient Visits  
• If permitted by institutional guidelines, remote patient v isits may be conducted with 
site staff by telephone or using video technology and/or with a visit by a home healthcare 
professional. Depending on local IRB/ IEC policy, a revised ICF may be needed to allow 
remote patient visits.  
• If new local  and/or central  laboratories are used during remote visits for safety laboratory 
assessments (eg, hematology and chemistry), ensure all te st results, laboratory 
certifications, and reference normal laboratory values and units are collected and 
documented in the site records consistent with institutional guidelines. The laboratory 
normal ranges should be provided to the sponsor for entry into  the clinical database.  
• Ensure all details of remote patient visits are documented in patient site records.  
Shipment of Clinical Trial Material to Patients  
Study drug (capsules or tablets) may be shipped to the homes of study participants being visited 
by home health professionals under three conditions: 1)  such clinical trial material shipment is 
permitted by local institution policy ; 2) shipment is by a secure, trackable method , and 
documentation of shipment and receipt is retained with the patient or pharmacy records ; 

Denovo Biopharma LLC   DB104 ( liafensine)  
DB104 -01 Protocol Amendment 2  Page 79 of 99 
CONFIDENTIAL  and 3) the material is shipped and stored per the requirements in Pharmacy Manual and the 
conditions stated on the study drug label . Clinical trial material exposed to temperature 
excursions should be replaced. In the patient’s home, clin ical trial material must be stored under 
the conditions stated on the container labels and the Pharmacy Manual. Unused material and 
empty containers should be returned to the study site to enable the pharmacy to maintain 
accountability records . 
If any publ ic health emergency  impacts  sites and subjects,  these  measures  should  be 
implemented  immediately  and remain  in place  until the impact  from  the public health emergency  
subsides.  
Missed Study Drug Administration  
If study drug administration is missed due to inability to obtain study drug during the public 
health emergency, this reason should be recorded in the patient site record and reported in the 
CRF as the reason for missed dose and will be documented as a protocol deviation.

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX  4. PLACEBO RESPONSE PROPENSITY SCALE 
(CLINICAL TRIAL VERSION)  
Overview  
The Placebo Response Propensity Scale (PRPS ) was designed to assess the probability of 
placebo response within  clinical trials and population -based studies. Within clinical trials the 
PRPS should be administered at the Screening and/or Baseline visit. In a cl inical trial the term 
health condition(s)  in the PRPS instructions should be changed to the health condition under 
study (eg, in a depression study the questions should ask about depression). The PRPS can be 
patient completed or administered by the site. M ode of administration should be included in the 
study data file. Any translations should be developed in collaboration with the developer 
following ISPOR guidelines and be certified.  
Using the PRPS within trials allows assessment of results with and withou t those with a high 
propensity for PBO response allowing for more confidence when trying to establish a true 
signal of efficacy. Each study using the PRPS provides an opportunity for additional analysis 
of the data giving more confidence in study results a nd helps identify patients most likely to be 
responders.

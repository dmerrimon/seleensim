Introduction  
  
This is a prospective clinical study to demonstrate a redu ction in jowling and laxity of the jawline that can be 
achieved following facial volume enhancement using JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC.  The secondary measure 
will be if this can be achieved with jawline injection only, or if a superior result can be obtained with both 
cheek and jowl injection.    
  
 Present methods for treating jowling include: 
            
1.  Temporary, semi-permanent and permanent injectable filler substances 
  
2.  Tissue tightening devices and radiofrequency microneedling 
  
3.  Suture lifts 
  
4.  Surgical implants 
  
5.  Surgical face lifts 
  
Early experimentation by the author with volume re placement using JUVÉDERM VOLUMA® XC has yielded 
good results with an excellent safety profile and mini mal downtime or adverse events. This study was 
undertaken to determine if patient satisfaction and result s can be measured by a reduction in jowl laxity and 
jawline crispness with apparent lift and whether it is enough to treat the jawline alone or it is best to treat the 
jawline in conjunction with the cheeks.  
 
Study Rationale  
  
Hyaluronic acid fillers are used primarily for the redu ction of wrinkles and age-related volume deficits. A 
common complaint of women is the formation of jowls, and they frequently pull up their skin toward their ears 
to indicate an outcome they wish for. In the past, face lift was the principle method to treat this problem, but 
many newer less-invasive techniques attempt to improve this area. One treatment that is a few years old is 
the dissolvable suture lift, targeting the mid cheek and ja wline to lift the face.  Another newer technique is the 
radiofrequency needling technique. Older treatments incl ude skin tightening treatments with radiofrequency 
or focused ultrasound.   
Many practitioners also use fillers with high G prime al ong the jawline or lateral face to accomplish improving 
the jowls. This technique, alternat ively called “jawline filler, jawline lift”, has not received FDA approval. 
JUVÉDERM VOLUMA® XC injectable gel is currently FD A approved for deep injection in the cheek area to 
correct age-related volume loss. In practice, we have seen the advent of cheek treatments with Voluma 
causing noticeable lifting in the jowls and also the nasol abial fold. However, recent experimentation with filler 
into the mandible lateral to the jowl , sometimes accom panied by injection into the preauricular area by this 
author has revealed that this area has been under represented in filler solutions for jowling.  
 
  
 
 
Protocol Summary 
 
This study is proposed to evaluate the best protocol  for achieving improvement in the sagging jawline. 
 
 JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC will be injected in each of  16 women with sagging of grades 1-3 using a 
published jawline evaluation scale (1). 
  Patients will be randomized 1:1 into 2 groups: 
  
Patient Group 1:   JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) will be injected bilaterally 
into the lateral jawline and inferior cheek area (preau ricular area) (the la tter area will be added  if necessary to 
achieve visual improvement in jowl attenuation). Tota l syringes used per person will have a range of 1-2) 
 
 Patient Group 2 :  JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-3 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) will be injected bilaterally 
into the lateral cheek (zygomatic) area plus JUVÉD ERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) 
will be injected into the lateral jawline and inferior cheek area (preauricular area ) (the latter area will be added 
if necessary to achieve visual improvement in jowl  attenuation). Total syringes used per person will have a 
range of 2-5)  
  
High resolution photographs from multiple angles will be taken in identical lighting and position with the VISIA 
CR and with the Fotofinder at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 w eeks, and 12 or 16 weeks. Additional real time video 
telemedicine visits will take place at 6 months and 12 months. In addition, a 72-hour safety phone call will be 
completed with the subject after ea ch injection session. All visit timi ng will be based on the last injection 
session. Oneblinded dermatologist and one unblinded dermatol ogist will rate the patient’s severity of jowling 
based on the Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) (1) at the  4- week, 8-week, and either 12 or 16-week visits. The 
patient will also rate their jowling based on the JR S as well as their satisfaction with the procedure. 
  
Name and Intended Use of Devices and Medications 
  
Proprietary name:  JUVÉDE RM VOLUMA™ XC     
Common name:  non-animal hyaluronic acid 
Intended use:  correction of cheek volume loss   
Materials 
  
The devices will be maintained according to the manufa cturer's suggested maintenance. The devices will be 
utilized as packaged with only the needles that were included in the packaging and without manipulating the 
filler device or contents. No can nulae will be utilized for this study. 
 
If needed for an adverse event, hyaluronidase will be ut ilized and will be stored according to manufacturers’ 
specification (Hylenex recombinant hyalur onidase human injection,150 USP units/cc). 
    
 
 
 
 
Benefit / Risk Analysis 
  
The benefits of participating in this study are to potent ially improve moderate to severe facial volume loss 
leading to an aging appearance, specifically in the jowls.    
Commonly reported side effects (SEs) of JUVÉDERM® in jectable fillers include, but are not limited to, 
injection-site erythema or redness, swelling, pain, te nderness, discomfort, firmness, lumps/bumps, bruising, 
discoloration, and itching. As most of these risks are common to filler injection procedures, the treating 
physician (TI) will use his/her medical judgment to  determine any necessar y intervention(s).    
 
Additional risks to undergoing a treatment like this include infection, blindness, stroke, vascular compromise, 
and scarring. More detailed information regarding the possible Adverse Events (AEs ), safety assessments, 
and investigator protocol in the event of intravascular injection will be noted below. 
 
This study proposes to evaluate a new indication fo r JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC, for which the benefit/risk 
profile has not been entirely assessed. While the risks of  stroke and blindness may be small, the jawline and 
cheek are highly vascularized areas. Due to limited ex perience and research associ ated with dermal filler use 
in this area, the actual risk is unknown.  
Alternatives 
  Alternatives to treatment include but are not limited to other injectable fillers, surgical implants, and surgery. 
 
 
Study Purpose and Objectives 
  
Purpose:        
 The purpose of this clinical investigation is  to study the perceived reduction of jowling 
following a volume replacement treatment using JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC in the jawline 
or in the jawline and the cheek 
 
Primary Objective:   
The primary objective of this study is to see that  a clinically relevant jowl improvement can be 
achieved with hyaluronic acid filler into  the jawline and/or cheek (Endpoint #1). 
The secondary objective is to determine which of the 2 methods (jowl injection alone or jowl 
injection with cheek injection) is superior ( Endpoint #2).

Information on Gender and Racial Inclusion/participation in study: 
 
Men have been excluded from this study for two re asons:(1) the technique pioneered in this study 
may not give a desirable aesthetic effect for men ev en if they reach the endpoi nt of improved jowling, 
due to the fact that they have a different sh ape of jawline than women and (2) men often need a 
higher amount of filler than women to achieve endpoint  and product is limited to grant from Allergan.   
 
The original Voluma study (see Package Insert), sh owed that there was no difference in response nor 
safety signals depended on Fitzpatrick skin types.  Alt hough this study is looking at a different area of 
study than that already approved (c heeks), there is no reason to presume this would change this 
initial observation. We may not have access to a ll skin types to recruit for this single center 
Investigator Initiated Clinical Trial, altho ugh we will attempt to recruit skin types 4-6. 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical Procedures 
  
Pre-Procedure Evaluation 
  
1.  At the first visit, the Investigator will obtain  a detailed patient histor y, examine the patient and 
determine if she fits the study criteria.  
  
2.  The Investigator will discuss treatment options  with the patient including injectable fillers and 
other treatment modalities. 
  
3.  During the first visit, the physician should obt ain an informed consent from the subject, clearly 
indicating his / her understanding of the requirem ents and risks involved with study participation, 
including but not limited to: 
  
a.  One to two treatments will be performed using JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC  
 
b.  A photographic record at baseline and all follow-up visits (2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 
weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 weeks).  
  
c.  There may be discomfort / pain / bruising and complete discussion of side effects 
potentially resulting from the treatment, includi ng possible stroke, blindness and scarring 
  
d.  Transient edema may occur immediately following the treatment. 
  
e.  Erythema and bruising may occur following treatment and last up two weeks or 
longer. 
  
f.   A full disclosure and written consent will be provided and signed. 
  
g.  If necessary as deemed by patient and/or  physician, a touch up may be performed at 
the 1-month visit. 
 
h.  Evaluations by phone and/or telemedicine will be performed at 72 hours after treatment, 
6 and 12 months.  
                            I. Patients will complete a safety diary daily via email for 30 days following treatments. 
    
If the patient passes all of t he inclusion and exclusion criteria for ent ry into the study the investigator will 
obtain signed Informed consent, enroll the patient into t he study, and record required data on the appropriate 
study data form. Pre-treatment photographs will be taken.  
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment 
  
1.   Photographs will be taken prior to treatm ent with the VISIA CR system and Fotofinder and 
with an iPad.  Frontal, 45- and 90-degree angle shots at standard illuminations will be taken. 
  
2. Patients will be randomized to 2 groups: 
  
Patient Group 1:  JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (e ach syringe is 1 cc) in will be injected bilaterally 
into the lateral Jawline/lateral medial or and inferi or cheek area (preauricular area) (the latter area will be 
added if necessary to achieve visual improvement in jowl attenuation). Total syringes used per person will 
have a range of 1-2. 
 
 
Patient Group 2:  JUVÉDERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-3 syringe s (each syringe is 1 cc) will be injected bilaterally 
into the lateral cheek (zygomatic) area plus JUVÉD ERM VOLUMA™ XC 1-2 syringes (each syringe is 1 cc) 
will be injected into the lateral jawline and inferior cheek area (preauricular area ) (the latter area will be added 
if necessary to achieve visual improvement in jowl  attenuation). Total syringes used per person will have a 
range of 2-5. 
 
Note: Based on preclinical studies and a toxicological ri sk assessment, subjects w ill be limited to 20 mL of 
JUVEDERM VOLUMA XC per 60 kg (130 lbs) body mass per ye ar. This includes any “Touch-up Volume” 
 
 
  
3.  During treatment cold air will be directed toward the injection sites to reduce discomfort. 
  
4.  Any complications will be noted at each visit and the patient will complete a diary via email or 
text every day. 
  
5.  Side Effects and possible adverse reacti ons will be monitored and documented before and 
after each treatment. Safety m easures will be outlined below.  
 
6.   Safety exams will be performed prior to and 30 minutes after treatment. These tests include 
the Snellen Eye Exam, Ocular Motility Exam, and Confrontational Visual Fields Exam. Cranial 
Nerve evaluations will also be performed prior to and 30 minutes after treatment. 
  
7.  The patient will be given postoperative instructions. 
  
8.  Inclusion in the study will require participation in all the follow-up visits. 
  
 
Return Visits 
  
The subject will have a phone call with the study coordinator at 72 hours. 
 
The subject will return at 2 weeks,4 weeks, 8 week s, and either 12 or 16 weeks following the treatment. 
 
The subject will have a live video telemedicine visit at  6 and 12 months after the last injection session. 
  
At all follow up in person visits, photographs will be taken.    
Any side effects or adverse events will be noted at ea ch study visit. Any changes in condition, medical 
history, or medications will be noted.  
 
Safety eye exams will be performed. These tests in clude the Snellen Eye Exam, Ocular Motility Exam, and 
Confrontational Visual Fields Exam. Cranial Nerve evaluations will also be  performed to further assess vision, 
oculomotor function, and lower face function.  
  
Patient questionnaire will be completed noting discomfort  from the treatment, downtime following treatment, 
their perception of the resu lts, would they have the treatment perfo rmed again in the future if they had the 
choice, and if they feel t hey need a touch-up (see below). 
 
The patient or treating physician may request one to uchup at one month, with the identical amounts and 
procedures as the first injection.  If this takes plac e, the patient will have another safety phone visit at 72 
hours, another 1-month follow-up visit similar to the first and shall not be eligible for a touch up at the second 
1-month visit.  The patient shall then have a 3 month visit after the second injection as well as a 6- and 12-
month videoconference visit from the second injectio n. Additional treatment is optional for the patient. 
 
Additional treatment is optional for the patient, but must be agreed upon by both patient and physician that 
additional improvement may be obtaine d of the jowl by the treatment.  
 
 
Safety Assessments    
 
Safety measures include:  
 
Ophthalmologic exams that include S nellen Eye Exam, Ocular Motility Exam, and Confrontational Visual 
Fields Exam. These exams will be performed prior to any treatment, 30 minutes after treatment, and at all 
follow up in person visits. Refer to the case r eport forms (CRFs) for examination procedures. 
 
To further assess visi on and oculomotor function, cranial Nerves II, III, IV, and VII will be assessed (left and 
right sides separately). To assess lower face function, cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, and XII will be assessed. 
These exams will be performed prior to any treatment, 30 minutes after treatment, and at all follow up visits. 
Subjects will also be asked about cranial nerve functionalit y in their safety diaries. Refer to the case report 
forms (CRFs) for examination procedures and criteria. 
 Patient will also have a jaw function assessment at all in person visits.  Please refer to the CRF for 
examination procedures and criteria. 
 
Patients will fill out a daily safety diary to monitor fo r any adverse events. Patients will be instructed to seek 
immediate medical attention if any signs of vascular compromise occur (pain in treatment site, excessive 
redness, purple coloration or blanching (white patches), blisters, and crusts. 
 
Adverse Reactions 
 
AEs will be monitored at every patient visit and through patient safety diaries completed daily for 1 month 
following treatment. Patients will be followed for a period of 12 months after final treatment.  
 Adverse Events of Special Interest, including vision chang es, will be reported to Allergan and the FDA within 
10 days. SAEs will be reported within 24 hours. All other AEs will be  reported annually. 
 
More detailed information including the AE report form will be included below.  
 The following is a list of common anticipated adverse re actions that have been reported with facial injection 
procedures in the area or at the injection site: 
● Bleeding 
● Bruising  
● Redness  
● Swelling 
● Lumps/bumps mass or nodule 
● Itching 
● Discoloration  
 
In rare circumstances, facial f illers have been associated with the fo llowing severe adverse events (SAEs): 
● Allergic reaction 
● Herpes Simplex Virus 1 outbreak 
● Giant cell reaction or granuloma formation 
● Vision changes (blurred vision, double vision, loss of peripheral vision, partial loss of the visual field) 
● Blindness (complete or partial) 
● Stroke 
● Vascular compromise 
● Scarring  
● Skin necrosis, ulceration and/ or nerve damage 
● Inability to chew or speak normally 
 
 While rare, unintentional injection into a blood vessel has been reported for facial injections which can be 
serious and may be permanent. Any incidence of visual disturbances (including, but not limited to, any loss of 
vision, blurry vision, double vision, pai n in or around the eye, blind spot or shadow in the visual field, trouble 
moving eyes, dizziness, confusion, weakness or numbness of the arms or legs, changes to consciousness or 
alertness, difficulty speaking or speech impairment, facial drooping etc.) will be immediately reported to the 
treating physician and the sponsor. In the event of blindness or any ophthalmic signs or symptoms, the 
subjects must undergo immediate evaluation by a retinal specialist. More details pertaining to the reporting 
protocol and treating vascular compromise will be outlined below.   
The incidence of serious adverse events associated with intravascular injection is very low. If a 
complication occurs, the subject will be advised to contact the study staff and treating physician 
immediately and the treating physician will use his/ her medical judgement to determine the necessary 
interventions to treat the subject.   
There are also unforeseeable risks or results associat ed with this procedure. If the subject experiences any 
unanticipated adverse event an additional visit and/ or report form may be required.  
 
 
 
 
Vascular Compromise Procedure and Protocol  
 
Recognition and Treatment of Vascular Occlusion: 
 
Recognition : 
Recognize vascular occlusion by a livedoid or violaceous appearance to the 
treatment area and/or blanching of the treatment area and/or patient pain.   
 
Early signs: 
• Blanching followed by violaceous patches in distribution of artery   
• Pain 
* especially if they have had a filler treatment before and it is unusual and/or 
more severe in days following injection 
 
  
 
 
     

 
 
 
Delayed signs: 
• Violaceous or dusky reticulated patches 
in distribution of arteries 
• Pain 
• Necrosis  
 
  
    
Arterial Compromise vs. Bruising: 
• Does not typically develop yellow coloration like bruising  
• Not typically round or in dependent areas like bruising  
  
 
 
 
 Treatment: 
When vascular occlusion is suspected, it is crucial th at the injection is stopped immediately and treatment is 
rapidly instigated. The objective is to facilitate blood fl ow to the affected area. The steps for treatment of a 
vascular occlusion are: 
1. Immediately flood the entire treatment area with injected 200-300 U of Hyaluronidase (1.25-2.0 cc of 
Hylenex, 150 u/cc).  
2. Apply a warm compress 3. Massage the area.   4. If no reduction in violaceous or blanching appearance and/or pain after 10 minutes, apply 2% 
nitroglycerin paste to promote vasodilatation. 
5. 60 min later if no improvement, reinject 200-300U of hyaluronidase.  6. Repeat Hourly and daily 7. If none of these measures work and depending on severity, institute daily hyperbaric oxygen 
chamber treatments.   

Hyaluronidase should be injected immediately, regardle ss of the filler used, and administered hourly and/or 
daily in liberal doses where signs and symptoms are present. 
When injecting hyaluronidase to treat acute ischem ia, consensus recommendations are that the entire 
ischemic area be treated, not just the site where HA was originally injected. Doses up to 1500 U may be 
required to achieve reversal of vascular compromise.

Recognition and Treatment of Retinal Occlusion 
If patient complains of loss of vision, periorbital pain,  blurred vision, ptosis, or impairment of extraocular 
muscle functionality immediately perform Sne llen Chart Visual Acuity Calculation.   
 
Fortunately, recent review of the liter ature asserted that the most common lo cations of injection leading to this 
complication were the forehead, nose and temple, and specifically the jawline was NOT involved in any single 
case  
Nevertheless, preparations will be made in event of this  catastrophic complication. There is no definitive and 
completely accepted protocol for treating this complication. 
However, most experts recommend:  
1. Assess visual acuity with Snellen Chart examination 2. Make sure pupils are round and equal and respond to light. 3. Immediately arrange for transfer to a retinal sur geon office and transfer at first opportunity (surgeon 
or associate to drive). 
4. Apply 1 drop of Timolol to affected eye. 5. Begin massage of the eye 
a. Digital massage should start immediately  
b. The patient should be placed in a supine position. c. Ensure the patient’s eyes are closed. d. Apply firm pressure (enough to ensure t hat the eyeball is indented about 2–3 mm) on the 
eyeball through the closed eyelids. 
e. Apply firm pressure for 5–15 s and quickly release. f. Repeat this cycle for at least 5 min. 
6. Flood the area of the supraorbital and suprat rochlear notch on the side with deficit with 
hyaluronidase. 
7. Have the patient rebreathe into a plastic or paper bag 
8. Put either 325 mg ASA OR sublingual ni troglycerin 0.6 mg under the patient’s tongue. 
9. Only as a last resort and after blindness has been established by Snellen Chart, Retinal surgeon not 
available, then undertake a retrobulbar injection with  hyaluronidase up to 1500 U, as in rare cases, it 
has been effective, although is not reco mmended due to poor literature and proof.

Discontinuation Criteria  
Reasons for early discontinuation from the study for individual subjects include: 
●Serious Adverse Event (including vascular em bolic event, leading to skin necrosis,
vision loss or stroke)
●Pregnancy
●Protocol deviation
●Physician decision
●Subject withdrawal
●Lost to follow-up
●Death
Should any vascular embolic event, vision loss, or stroke occur, the study will be discontinued. 
The enrollment and treatment will be suspe nded and a root cause investigation will be 
conduc ted to determine the cause of the event and whether the outcome w as anticipated (the 
investig ator did not properly follow the treatmen t SOP) or unanticipated (the investigator DID 
properly follow the treatment SOP). If the event was unanticipated , the study will be 
immediately suspended and enrollment will be halted until the event can be properly 
characterize d and an appropriate treatment strategy to avoid this unanticipated even t can be 
devised. 
Patients enrolled in the study will be informed  of any new events or risks  to the study treatment 
and may choose to continue participation or be withdrawn at any time.  
Withdrawal 
Patients enrolled in the study  will be free to discontinue their participation in the study at any time.  A decision 
to discontinue partici pation will not prejudice  their medi cal care.  In those instan ces, the investigator will 
attempt to obtain  clinical results and  side effect evalua tion concerni ng the patient prior to hi s / her withdrawal. 
Detail s of the subject’ s withdrawal from t he study will be noted and r eported to sponsor.  
Data Analysis 
Data will be collected via digital photographs and questionnaires by the subjects. 
Photographs will remain unretouched. One blinded dermatologist and one unblinded dermatologist will rate 
the patient’s severity of jowling based on the J awline Rating Sc ale (JRS) (1) at baseline, the 4-week, 8-week, 
and 12 or 16-week visits.  The patient will also rate their jowling based on the JRS as well as  their 
satisfaction with the procedure. 
Analysis of Scientific Soundness of the Protocol 
The proposed study has been designed to prov ide a valid method to analyze the safety and efficacy of facial 
volume replacement.  Measure taken to assure that the study  provides  valid data are as follows : 
1. Photographs will be taken under st andardized conditions.  Photographs will be taken with a VISIA
CR, a device made by Canfield Scientific specifically to be utilized for clinical research to provide
uniformity in patient photographs.
2. Adverse or unanticipated effects that occur during the course of this clinical study will be recorded
and carefully analyzed as to their relationship to the treatment.
3. Evaluators will review individual  photos without knowledge of if they are before or after photos.
 
Primary Outcome Measure: 
 
1. The primary outcome is a reduction of 1 or more points of the Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) 
Assessment (on scale of 0 to 4) at baseline versus that at 4 weeks from the last injection (whether 
initial or touch-up) based on any or all of  one blinded dermatologist rating, one unblinded 
dermatologist rating, and patient rating.    (A lower number will mean a better outcome) Time Frame: 
Baseline to 4 weeks after last injection. 
 
 
Secondary Outcome Measures 
 
1. Reduction of 1 or more points of the Jawline Rati ng Scale (JRS) Assessment (on scale of 0 to 4) at 
baseline versus that at 4 weeks from the last in jection based on the patients rating while looking in 
the mirror and at before and after photographs. A lower number will mean a better outcome. Time Frame: 4 weeks from last injection 
2.  Whether group 1 and group 2 has a higher reductio n in the Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) (on scale of 
0 to 4)  at 4 weeks from the lastinjection co mpared to baseline based on ratings from one blinded 
dermatologist and one unblinded dermatologist.
 . A lower number will mean a better outcome. Time 
Frame: 4 weeks from last injection 
3. Whether group 1 or group 2 has a higher reduction in the Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) (on scale of 0 
to 4)  at 4 weeks from the last injection co mpared to baseline based on the patients rating while 
looking in the mirror and at before and after photographs.  . A lower number will mean a better 
outcome. Time Frame: 4 weeks from last injection 
4. Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) Assessment on scale of 0 to 4 at 4 weeks: One blinded dermatologist 
and one unblinded dermatologist will rate the patient's severity of jowling based on the Jawline Rating 
Scale (JRS). The patient will also  rate their jowling based on t he Jawline Rating Scale (JRS). The 
scale is on a rating of 0 to 4. A lower number will mean a better outcome. [Time Frame: 4 weeks] 
5. Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) Assessment on scale of 0 to 4 at 8 weeks: One blinded dermatologist 
and one unblinded dermatologist will rate the patient's severity of jowling based on the Jawline Rating 
Scale (JRS). The patient will also  rate their jowling based on t he Jawline Rating Scale (JRS). The 
scale is on a rating of 0 to 4. A lower number will mean a better outcome. [Time Frame: 8 weeks] 
6. Jawline Rating Scale (JRS) Assessment on sc ale of 0 to 4 at 12 or 16 weeks: One blinded 
dermatologist and one unblinded dermatologist will rate the patient's severity of jowling based on the 
Jawline Rating Scale (JRS). The patient will also ra te their jowling based on the Jawline Rating Scale 
(JRS). The scale is on a rating of 0 to 4. A lowe r number will mean a better outcome. [Time Frame: 3 
months from last treatment] 
7. Incidence of abnormal eye exam (Confrontat ional Visual Fields Exam) findings (Safety): 
Ophthalmologic exams that include Confrontational Visual Fields  Exam will be performed prior to any 
treatment, 30 minutes after treatment, and at all follow up in-person visits. [Time Frame: up to 18 
months] 
8. Incidence of abnormal eye exam (Snellen Eye Exam) findings (Safety): 
Ophthalmologic exams that include Snellen Eye Ex am will be performed prior to any treatment, 30 
minutes after treatment, and at all follow up in -person visits. [Time Frame: up to 18 months] 
9. Incidence of abnormal eye exam (Ocular Motility Exam) findings (Safety): 
Ophthalmologic exams that include Ocular Motility  Exam will be performed prior to any treatment, 
30 minutes after treatment, and at all follow up in -person visits. [Time Frame: up to 18 months] 
10. Incidence of abnormal cranial nerves II, III,  IV and VII assessments findings (Safety): 
To further assess vision and oculom otor function, cranial nerves II, III, IV, and VII will be assessed 
(left and right sides separately). To assess lower face function, cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, and XII will 
be assessed. These exams will be performed prior to any treatment, 30 minutes after treatment, 
and at all follow up visits. [Time Frame: up to 18 months] 
11. Adverse events: 
Adverse events will be recorded until 12 months afte r last treatment. [Time Frame: up to 12 months 
after last treatment]

Cranial Nerves II-VII; IX, X, XII Evaluation Criteria 
Cranial 
Nerve Nerve Name Function Test 
II 
III Optic Nerve 
Oculomotor Nerve Pupillary 
reaction to 
light and 
accommodati
on Tell the subject to look into the distance. Sh ine a bright light obliquely into each pupil. 
Look for: 
• Direct light reflex – Pupillary constriction in the same eye. 
• Consensual reaction – Pupillary constriction in the opposite eye. 
• Accommodation – move the penlight toward the nose and observe pupillary 
constriction. 
III 
IV VI Oculomotor Nerve 
Trochlear Nerve 
Abducens Nerve Extraocular 
movements Stand two feet directly in front of subject. Use your finger to ma ke a horizontal sweep 
from the subject’s left to th e right at the level of the subject’s eyes. Repeat this 
horizontal sweep at the level of the forehe ad and the chin. Look for normal conjugate 
movement of the eyes in each direction or  any deviation from normal. A few beats of 
nystagmus on far lateral gaze is normal. 
V Trigeminal Nerve Motor Ask the subject to clench thei r teeth. Palpate the temporal and masseter muscles and 
note strength of muscle contraction. 
Gross 
sensation Tell subject to close their eyes. Using a cotton swab stick or similar object, touch the 
subject’s forehead, cheeks and jaw with the dull cotton end and the sharper wooden end in random fashion. Ask the subject to say if they feel the object is dull or sharp. Compare sensation on both sides of the face. 
VII Facial Nerve Motor The Regional House-Brackmann Fa cial Nerve Grading System will be used to evaluate 
the facial nerve branches at rest and durin g conversation with the subject. Ask the 
subject to: 
• Raise both eyebrows 
• Frown 
• Close both eyes tightly while Inve stigator tries to open eye lids 
• Show both upper and lower teeth 
• Smile 
• Puff out both cheeks 
IX Glossopharyngeal  
Nerve 
Vagus Nerve Gagging, 
swallowing 
(gross 
sensation and 
motor); 
Speech  Ask subject to swallow while palpating front of the neck. Subject should have no issues 
or discomfort when swallowing.  
(Assess gag reflex if patient reports changes from baseline and if there is reason to 
suspect related pathology).  
Ask subject to say “Ahhh”. The uvula should elevate symmetrically as a normal 
response. Subject should have no difficulty or impairments when speaking. Note if 
hoarseness is present.  
X 
XII Hypoglossal Tongue 
Movement 
(Motor) Ask patient to stick their tongue out and have  them move side to side, from cheek to 
cheek. Tongue movements should be symmetrical.

POST-TREATMENT INSTRUCTIONS 
 
 
• Immediately after the treatment, there may be re dness, swelling, tenderness, bruising and an 
itching sensation in the treated area. This is a normal result of the injections.  The 
inconvenience is temporary and generally disappear s within a few days.  If the inconvenience 
continues or, if other reactions occur, please contact the office. 
 
• Some patients experience swelling for about a week and can look somewhat uneven during 
this time. This means that the result directly after the treatment should not been seen as the 
final result. Cool compresses or ice packs for 48 hours may help to reduce swelling. Bruising 
in all treated areas may last up to 2 weeks. 
 
• Avoid excessive sun and UV lamp exposur e until any initial swelling and redness have 
resolved.   
 
• The treated areas may be washed with soap and water. If required, light makeup may be 
applied with clean fingers following treatment. 
 
• Until the initial swelling and redness have reso lved, do not expose the treated area to intense 
heat (e.g. sauna and sunbathing) or extreme cold. 
 
• If you have previously suffered from facial cold  sores, there is a risk that the needle punctures 
could contribute to another eruption of cold so res. Please tell your provider if you have a 
history of cold sores. 
 
• If you are using aspirin or any similar medi cation, be aware that these may increase the 
bruising and bleeding at the injection site. If pain medication is necessary, please use Tylenol (acetaminophen). 
 
• In a study to evaluate Voluma for injecti on of the cheeks, the average duration for the 
majority of patients was  up to 2 years, but not every patient achieved this duration. This 
study of  of Voluma in the jawline and cheeks is not intended to study duration of effect.  After 
the effect of the injection wear s off (estimate from 6 months to 2 years), you would have to be 
reinjected outside of the study to reestablish effe ct.  To properly evaluation the safety in this 
study, you would not be eligible for reinjection unt il 12 months after your last study injection.   
• Complete Patient diary daily for 30 days following treatment. 
 
• If you experience any side effects or unusual  symptoms, or have any other questions or 
concerns, please contact the office immediately at: 847-459-6400.

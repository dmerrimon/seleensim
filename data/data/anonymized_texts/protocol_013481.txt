 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
TITLE  Lung Transplant READY (Resources for Education and Decision -
making for Your CF) Pilot Study  
SPONSOR  University of Washington  
FUNDING 
ORGANIZATION  National Institutes of Health (NIH)  - The National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute  (NHLBI)  
NUMBER OF SITES  1 
SPECIFIC AIMS  1. Determine whether Take on Transplant (online educational  tool) 
improves patient preparedness for lung transplant (LTx) 
discussions  using a pilot study that employs randomized, 
controlled, rollover trial design . 
2. Longitudinally assess time spent using Take on Transplant  
through patient -level  analysis of tool usage and identify 
predictors of increased usage.  
RATIONALE  1. Despite therapeutic advances in CF care, many CF patients will 
go on to require LTx, including  individuals already affected by 
advanced lung disease, those for whom highly effective CFTR 
modulators are  not available or not tolerated, and for some 
despite C FTR modulators. Individuals with CF seek information  
about LTx and feel underprepared for the LTx decision. Use of a 
decision  support tool or online educational materials about LTx 
may improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of LTx 
education in C F clinic and empower  patients to engage in 
discussions about this complex medical  treatment by increasing 
their sense of  preparedness for the discussion. Feasibility must be 
established.  The Preparation for Decision Making  (PrepDM ) 
Scale [1] is a validated  measure of preparedness for decision  
making with known variance  and high  internal consistency (a 
0.92-0.96),  but it has not been studied in the CF  population. 
Individual questions within  the PrepDM Scale are informative 
and reflect IPDAS process  measures [2, 3] . It is unclea r whether 
there are ceiling or floor  effects for particular questions within  
the PrepDM scale when evaluating a  LTx decision support tool in 
the CF population, and the proposed pilot  study utilizing a test -
retest approach will establish preliminary means  standard 
deviations, and reliability in this  population. A prior decision aid 
for LTx in CF was shown to decrease de cisional conflict in a 
randomized  clinical trial and we will assess change in the 
Decisional Conflict Scale as a secondary endpoint. [4] 
2. Engagement with Take on Transplant over time allows users to 
explore the content,  potentially viewing more ‘CF Stories’ , 
‘Resource Library’ , and ‘Frequently Asked  Questions’  content 
and more interactions with ‘ My CF Stage ’. Shared decision -
making may naturally appeal to and benefit individuals who seek 
out health -related information, feel empowered to advocate for 
their own needs, and have more advanced  educational attainment, 
while potentially increasing dispar ities for patients who are 
already disadvantaged.  Shared decision making interventions 
STUDY00011578  Confidential  
 
 
Page 6 of 32 
 tailored to disadvantaged groups can increase knowledge, 
informed  choice s and participation in decision -making, and 
reduce decisional conflict for patients in disadvantaged  groups.  
We will obtain an individualized, longitudinal view of the 
participants’ usage data as they interact with Take on Transplant , 
including page views a nd time spent per page, to characterize 
usage patterns over the 1 month. Characterization of different use 
patterns among individuals with disadvantaged backgrounds 
(oversampled in Aim 1) could inform enhancements to t  Take on 
Transplant  to improve usage a nd acceptability by patients with 
limited access to LTx. Carefully assessing health literacy with the 
TOFHLA [5], an instrument that me asures health -related reading 
comprehension and numeracy, could lead to understanding of 
mechanisms underlying differential use of Take on Transplant 
and change in PrepDM Scale . 
STUDY DESIGN  This is a prospective, multi -center, randomized, controlled sing le-
blind rollover pilot study  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  To test feasibility and efficacy of Take on Transplant  to improve 
patient preparedness for decision making about LTx.  
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES  • Understand LTx knowledge gained .  
• Assess changes in decisional conflict.  
• Measure changes in preparedness for LTx discussions . 
• Assess changes in depression and anxiety symptoms.  
• Longitudinally characterize time spent using  Take on 
Transplant through analysis of patient -level usage data and 
determine whether ongoing use  of the tool is associated with 
maintaining or increasing ratings of preparedness at 1 -month.  
• Identify baseline demographic and health literacy predictors of 
increased  Take on Transplant  usage  
• Analyze interview transcripts to inform revision of Take on 
Transplant prior to a large randomized controlled trial  
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  ~50

 DURATION OF SUBJECT 
PARTICIPATION AND 
DURATION OF STUDY  Subjects will be on study for up to 4 weeks  with a total of three  study 
sessions: Introduction Session, 2 -Week Follow -up Session, and 4 -
Week F ollow -up Session.  
PRIMARY ENDPOINT  The co-primary endpoint is feasibility, which will be defined  as 
successful by 90% of enrolled participants completing the 2-week 
study visit.  
 
The co -primary endpoint  is an intention -to-treat assessment of the 
difference in mean PrepDM  Scale in the intervention versus control 
arms of the study at the 2 -week study visit.  
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  • Difference in mean confidence -weighted true false (CTF) 
knowledge score will be measured in the intervention versus 
control arms of the study. CTF scoring adds points for certainty 
in correct responses and deducts points for certainty in incorrect 
response s. Participants receive +2 points when "sure" about a 
correct response, +1 if unsure about a correct response, -1 if 
unsure about an incorrect response and -2 if sure about an 
incorrect response. For a 14 -item knowledge test, the maximum 
score is +28 and t he minimum score is -28, with higher scores 
indicating more knowledge about  lung transplant.  
• Decisional Conflict Scale change will be measured from the 
baseline study visit to the 2 -week study visit. The intention -to-
treat analysis will compare mean chang e in the Decisional 
Conflict Scale between the intervention and control arms of the 
study. Scores range from 0 [no decisional conflict] to 100 
[extremely high decisional conflict].  
• Likert rating of preparedness will be measured at the 2 -week 
study visit ( 0=Don't know, 1= Not at all prepared, 2 = A little 
prepared, 3 = Moderately prepared, 4 = Very prepared). The 
intention -to-treat analysis will compare mean Likert -scale rating 
between the intervention and control arms of the study . 
• PHQ -9 is a scale that me asures symptoms of depression in the 
prior 2 weeks on a 0 -27 scale, with higher scores indicating 
worsening depression and a score of 10 or higher consistent with 
a diagnosis of depression. Investigators will assess the difference 
in mean PHQ -9 score in th e intervention versus control arms of 
the study at the 2 -week study visit. Investigators will also 
determine the proportion with new PHQ -9 score greater than or 
equal to 10 in each arm . 
• GAD -7 is a scale that measures symptoms of anxiety in the prior 
2 week s on a 0 -21 scale, with higher scores indicating worsening 
anxiety and a score of 10 or higher consistent with a diagnosis of 
generalized anxiety disorder. Investigators will assess the 
difference in mean GAD -7 score in the intervention versus 
control arms  of the study at the 2 -week study visit. Investigators 
will also determine the proportion with new GAD -7 score greater 
than or equal to 10 in each arm.  
• Longitudinally characterize time spent using  Take on 
Transplant through analysis of patient -level usage data. Average 
STUDY00011578  Confidential  
 
 
Page 8 of 32 
 time spent using the research website from baseline to 2 weeks 
will be compared across study arms. Further, time spent using the 
investigator -designed website will be assessed as a predictor of: 
1. change in CTF knowledge about  LTx (14-questi on 
investigator -designed survey) from baseline to 2 -week study 
visit, 2. change in Likert preparedness from baseline to 2 -week 
study visit, 3. change in Decisional Conflict Scale from baseline 
to 2-week study visit, and 4. mean PrepDM Scale at 2 -weeks.  
• The PrepDM Scale will be measured for all participants with 
respect to Take on Transplant  and mean score will be compared 
for participants in the intervention (4 weeks of exposure) versus 
control arms (2 weeks of exposure). PrepDM scores range on a 
scale from  0 to 100 with higher scores indicating a higher 
perceived level of preparation for decision making.  
• Identify baseline demographic and health literacy predictors of 
increased  tool usage .

2.4 Subject selection  
2.4.1 General characteristics of the proposed subject population(s)  
Study subject s will be volunteer CF patients, age 18 years or above with FEV 1 of less 
than 50% predicted and have not yet undergone LTx. Approximately 5 0 subjects who 
give informed consent, meet  all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria 
will be enrolled in the study.  
LTx is an option for treating end -stage lung disease in CF. The population of CF patients 
with FEV 1 less than 50% represents a subset of individuals living wit h CF who are closer 
to the stage where LTx might become a viable option. These patients are the ones most 
likely to benefit from access to ToT, making them a relevant and representative group for 
this investigation.  Additionally, individuals with low socio economic status have 
historically limited access to lung transplant and worsened outcomes. We aim to include 
individuals considered to be from “communit ies of concern” as a minimum of 30% of our 
study population. The  “communities of concern”  will be individuals who are racially

2.4.4  Exclusion criteria  
1. Previously underwent  LTx  
2.5 Study procedures  
2.5.1 Screening procedures  
Research coordinators and lead researchers at the U niversity of Washington (UW)  Adult 
Cystic Fibrosis Clinic will conduct eligibility screening by utilizing the Cystic Fibrosis 
Patient Registry database ( PortCF), medical records, and clinic schedules. Eligible 
individuals w ill be  contacted before their clinic appointments, with study information 
provided via phone, and consent forms offered through mail or email.  
 
Additionally, in STUDY0007475 approved by the UW HSD IRB, participants will be  
distributed a screening survey which provide s the ability to voluntarily opt -in to being 
contacted by the UW research team for additional opportunities to participate in related  
studies. Collaborators at external sites will screen their local PortCF registry for 
participants meeting eligibility criteria and advertise the availability of the screening 
survey. CF patients consent separately to participate in the CFF registry which allows for 
screening for research study eligibility. The screening survey w ill be advertized to 
eligible participants at collaborating CF centers which allow s for the recruitment of 
participants from within and outside of the UW to enable generalizable res ults. Per HHS 
guidelines, collaborating sites were considered not engaged in the research and did not 
require site -IRB approval to advertise the availability of this screening survey.  
 
Individuals recruited from STUDY0007475 who opt -in to being contacted b y the UW 
research team  will be  contacted to participate in this study. Study staff at the UW will call 
the patient and provide detailed information about the study. UW study staff  will provide 
informed consent over the phone and the patient will provide verbal consent to 
participate. The UW research coordinator will mail or email cop ies of the consent form 
for participants to keep for their records .

 2.5.2 Study procedures  
The study will last four weeks with a total of three study sessions includin g the 
following: Baseline  Session  (V1) , 2-Week Follow -up Session  (V2) , and 4 -Week Follow -
up Session  (V3) . All study visits will occur remotely via Zoom videoconferencing . 
 
Study procedures will include the following:  
 
Survey s – Participants will be asked to complete survey s at each study session. Surveys 
may consist of the following instruments: PrepDM Scale [1], Decisional Conflict 
Scale [6], Shortened Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S -TOFHLA) [5], 
questions from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) [7], assessment 
of health numeracy [8], GAD -7[9], an investigator -designed lung transplant knowledge 
assessment, System Usability Scale (SUS) [10], general satisfaction scale, Hospital 
anxiety and depression scale ( HADS )[11], PHQ -9[12], Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire – 
Revised (CFQ -R)[13], Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) [14], Intervention 
Appropriateness Measure (IAM) [14], and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) [14]. 
Each set of surveys will take approximately 15 -20 minutes to complete.  
 
Interview – Interviews will take place at each study session, via Zoom teleconferenci ng. 
Interviews will take approximately 30 -60 minutes. All interviews will be recorded and 
transcribed for qualitative analyses. The research team will use an interview guide with 
directed questions discussing topics including shared decision making and gen eral 
feedback on ToT and the attention control website (unos.org) including perceptions of 
and experience with using the resources, and any barriers to ongoing use of the research 
website. Structured interviews on the day of the baseline  session may also a ddress 
preparedness to discuss LTx, ask participants to describe the most impactful aspect of the 
research website s, and summarize the ‘CF Story’ that was most meaningful.  
 
Research website  – Participants will be introduced to the research website during the 
baseline  session  (V1) . The research website is a portal that will contain  links to  two 
interventions including ToT and an attention control ( unos.org). Before accessing the 
research website during the baseline  session, participants will be randomized  to first 
receive access to only one of the two websites  through the portal . The research website 
will track website usage (i.e. time spent, content accessed, etc.) for all study participants  
for both ToT and unos.org . Once the participant completes the 2 -week study visit (V2), 
the portal will contain access to both ToT and unos.org for the remainder of the study (2 
more weeks).  
2.5.3 Allocation to treatment  arms  
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either the intervention  (“Take on Transplant”) or 
the attention control ( unos.org) , stratified by FEV 1 <30% versus 30 -50%. Participants 
will be given access to their assign ed website via the research website portal  for two 
weeks. After the 2 -week session interview, a ccess to the opposite arm assignment will be 
unlocked and participants will have unlimited access to both the intervention  (ToT) and 
the attention control (Unos.org).

 2.5.6 Withdrawal of subjects   
Subjects can withdraw at any point in time. They will be given contact information of the 
study staff if they decide they would like to withdraw or if they have any questions 
pertaining to their involvement in the study.  
2.5.8 Procedures to assess safety  
We will assess safety using the PHQ -9[12] and GAD -7[9] survey assessment s. 
 
The topic of LTx can be distressing to some with CF. There could be  a risk of increasing 
depression symptoms and/or suicidality through the introduction of LTx education in this 
patient population. The PHQ -9 and GAD -7 survey s will be administered at  the baseline 
visit (V1) and at  both study  visits (V2, V3) after patients gain access to ToT or unos.org 
to assess whether introduction of transplant education  has a negative psychological 
impact on patients including an increase in  anxiety, depression, and/or distress. Patients 
with an abnormal PHQ -9 or GAD -7 will be allowed to enroll in the study because 
depression  and anxiety  are prevalen t in advanced CF lung disease. We hypothesize use of 
ToT may actually lessen patients’ depress ion and/or anxiety with time.   
 
The interviewer (UW research staff) will review PHQ -9 responses immediately after 
responses are submitted. The interviewer will also probe, via discussion with the 
participant, for any indicators of negative psychological impacts of use of the decision 
support tool. If possible suicidality is endorsed on the PHQ -9 (positive response to 
question #9) , the interviewer will provide a subject who endorses possible suicidality 
with the National Suicide Hotline phone number and will inform them to call the 
Nationa l Suicide Hotline if they need help prior to receiving the call from Dr. Ramos or 
another study physician about the PHQ -9 results.  Additionally, the PI, or another study 
physician, will be notified immediately after  the abnormal PHQ -9 result is entered . The 
patient’s CF clinician will be contacted directly immediately via secure communication, 
by the PI , in the setting of possible suicidality . The PI or another study physician will call 
the patient within 8 hours of a PHQ -9 response that indicates suicidali ty and the 
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) screen with triage points for primary 
care will be completed. The C -SSRS response protocol will be followed and a safety 
contract will be established with the patient by the physician by phone. Dr.  Ramos, and 
the other study physicians, are trained physicians, practicing medicine in populations 
with advanced diseases, end of life concerns, and high rates of mental illness. Dr. Ramos 
has clinical experience with patients who report suicidality and ha s the resource of a 
trained CF mental health specialist for complex cases.

2.6 Study outcome e valuations  
2.6.1 Study endpoints  
Primary endpoint s 
• The co -primary endpoint is feasibility, which will be defined as successful by 
90% of enrolled participants completing the 2-week study visit.  
 
• The co -primary endpoint is an intention -to-treat assessment of the difference in 
mean PrepDM Scale in the interv ention versus control arms of the study at the 2 -
week study visit.  
 
Secondary endpoint s 
• Difference in mean confidence -weighted true false (CTF) knowledge score will 
be measured in the intervention versus control arms of the study. CTF scoring 
adds points for certainty in correct responses and deducts points for certainty in 
incorrect response s. Participants receive +2 points when "sure" about a correct 
response, +1 if unsure about a correct response, -1 if unsure about an incorrect 
response and -2 if sure about an incorrect response. For a 14 -item knowledge test, 
the maximum score is +28 and t he minimum score is -28, with higher scores 
indicating more knowledge about lung transplant.  
• Decisional Conflict Scale change will be measured from the baseline study visit to 
the 2 -week study visit. The intention -to-treat analysis will compare mean chang e 
in the Decisional Conflict Scale between the intervention and control arms of the 
study. Scores range from 0 [no decisional conflict] to 100 [extremely high 
decisional conflict].  
• Likert rating of preparedness will be measured at the 2 -week study visit ( 0=Don't 
know, 1= Not at all prepared, 2 = A little prepared, 3 = Moderately prepared, 4 = 
Very prepared). The intention -to-treat analysis will compare mean Likert -scale 
rating between the intervention and control arms of the study.  
• PHQ -9 is a scale that me asures symptoms of depression in the prior 2 weeks on a 
0-27 scale, with higher scores indicating worsening depression and a score of 10 
or higher consistent with a diagnosis of depression. Investigators will assess the 
difference in mean PHQ -9 score in th e intervention versus control arms of the

Page 15 of 32 
 study at the 2 -week study visit. Investigators will also determine the proportion 
with new PHQ -9 score greater than or equal to 10 in each arm.  
• GAD -7 is a scale that measures symptoms of anxiety in the prior 2 week s on a 0 -
21 scale, with higher scores indicating worsening anxiety and a score of 10 or 
higher consistent with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Investigators 
will assess the difference in mean GAD -7 score in the intervention versus control 
arms  of the study at the 2 -week study visit. Investigators will also determine the 
proportion with new GAD -7 score greater than or equal to 10 in each arm.  
• Longitudinally characterize time spent using Take on Transplant through analysis 
of patient -level usage data. Average time spent using the research website from 
baseline to 2 weeks will be compared across study arms. Further, time spent using 
the investigator -designed website will be assessed as a predictor of: 1. change in 
CTF knowledge about LTx (14 -questi on investigator -designed survey) from 
baseline to 2 -week study visit, 2. change in Likert preparedness from baseline to 
2-week study visit, 3. change in Decisional Conflict Scale from baseline to 2 -
week study visit, and 4. mean PrepDM Scale at 2 -weeks.  
• The PrepDM Scale will be measured for all participants with respect to Take on 
Transplant and mean score will be compared for participants in the intervention (4 
weeks of exposure) versus control arms (2 weeks of exposure). PrepDM scores 
range on a scale from  0 to 100 with higher scores indicating a higher perceived 
level of preparation for decision making.  
• Identify baseline demographic and health literacy predictors of increased tool 
usage.  
2.6.2 Sample size determination  
This will be a pilot and feasibility study, and we anticipate 90% of 50 enrolled 
participants (95% CI 79 -96%) will complete the 2-week study visit (V 2).     
2.6.3 Statistical analysis plan  
Primary endpoints  
The co-primary endpoint is feasibility, which wil l be defined successful by 90% of 
enrolled participants completing the 2-week study visit (V 2). Descriptive statistics will be 
used to determine whether this threshold was met.  
 
The co -primary endpoint of difference in PrepDM scale score ( Difference = intervention 
– control ) at 2-weeks will be  assessed using linear regression, with statistical significance 
level set at 2-sided  alpha  <0.05.  
 
Secondary endpoints  
Continuous secondary endpoints will be assessed using linear regression, with sta tistical 
significance level set at 2 -sided alpha <0.05 . 
 
Categorical secondary endpoints will be assessed using Pearson's chi -squared test of 
independence , with statistical significance level set at 2 -sided alpha <0.05 . 
Graphical methods and descriptive st atistics will be used to evaluate differences in usage 
during the 4 weeks  of access across subsets of the cohort with different socioeconomic 
STUDY00011578  Confidential  
 
 
Page 16 of 32 
 status  (based on insurance status, income, education level) and health literacy (based on 
S-TOFHLA). Exploratory m odels will test for a dose -response relationship by 1) time 
spent using the tool (uses/week) and 2) number of ‘CF Stories’ viewed and PrepDM 
Scale at 2-week and 4 -week study visits . Linear regression may be used to determine 
whether predictors of increased  time spent using the tool can be identified from baseline 
demographics and questionnaire results. Subgroup analyses will compare changes across 
instruments among participants with adequate health literacy to those with inadequate or 
marginal health litera cy. We will also perform subgroup analysis for patients with FEV 1 
<30% predicted.  
These data will inform the feasibility of completing a larger, multicenter, randomized 
controlled trial of ToT  and will inform duration of the larger trial.  
2.6.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will not be necessary for th is research  protocol.  
Research in this pilot study poses no more than minimal risk to participants. There will be 
no statistical monitoring to determine whether t he clinical trial should be terminated for 
reasons of safety. There will be no interim evaluations for efficacy. There are no planned 
stopping rules for futility since this is a pilot study. Safety monitoring will focus on 
ensuring participants are not exp eriencing any significant or unexpected psychological 
distress and that they are satisfied with the study intervention and interviews. The 
Principal Investigator will provide ongoing observation for psychological distress as 
reported in satisfaction survey s or during interviews. The PI will monitor for Adverse 
Events related to the study, but there is a very low risk for adverse events with the 
proposed intervention. Dr. Ramos has three years of experience as a medical monitor for 
the Cystic Fibrosis Founda tion Therapeutics Development Network Coordinating Center, 
and is well -qualified to review and make a  determination of relatedness of a  serious 
adverse event  (SAE ) to the study intervention.  
3.0 RISK ANALYSIS  
3.1 Anticipated risks  
Subjects may be exposed to minimal risks associated with the conduct of this study.  
 
Psychological risks: Given the sensitive nature of LTx as a treatment option for CF, it is 
possible that patients may experience psychological distress from reading about  
transplant, especially i n cases where CF patients have died after LTx. We have worked to 
mitigate this risk by allowing participants to moderate the amount of information they 
read about particular patient stories or ‘Resource Library’ content. Specifically, we have 
applied label s to ‘CF Stories’ with a “bad outcome” or “death,” which are visible prior to 
entering the story. Additionally, over the course of a participant’s  involvement in this 
research study we will monitor mental health by administering mental health 
assessments, including the PHQ -9 survey. It is possible that a participant  may experience 
psychological discomfort by completing these assessments. To protect a participant’s  
wellbeing, if abnormal results are reported in the PHQ -9 the UW research team will 
notify their CF doctor for follow -up care.  
STUDY00011578  Confidential  
 
 
Page 17 of 32 
  
There is no proven benefit of ToT at this time, but a prior (now outdated) decision aid for 
LTx in CF showed a reduction in decisional conflict and we hypothesize that the 
proposed intervention will increase preparedness fo r decision making and decrease 
decisional conflict related to LTx. Further, this pilot study will provide important 
feedback to optimize ToT for future users.  
3.2 Adverse event reporting  
3.2.1  Adverse event definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product or undergoing an investigational procedure 
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or procedure. An 
AE is therefore a ny unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an 
investigational product or procedure, whether or not related to that investigational 
product. An unexpecte d AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or 
frequency in the currently accepted risk profile for the treatment or procedure.  
An unanticipated problem (UP) is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following c riteria:  
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics o f the subject population being studied;  
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures 
involved in the research); and  
3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
An SAE is defined as any untowar d medical occurrence that at any level of procedural 
intensity:  
1. Results in death  
2. Is considered life threatening (i.e., in the view of the Investigator the adverse 
experience places the patient or participant at immediate risk of death from the 
response, as  it occurred; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death)  
3. Requires hospital admission or prolongation of an existing hospitalization  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
5. Is an important medical event (i.e., when based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, the adverse experience may jeopardize the patient or participant and 
STUDY00011578  Confidential  
 
 
Page 18 of 32 
 may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above listed 
outcomes)  
For the purposes of the proposed study, participant report of possible suicidality on the 
PHQ -9 is an immediately reportable AE, even if it is not an SAE. An alternative 
approach would be to utilize the PHQ -8 (which excludes the question about suicide), but 
it is important to understand whether there is a risk of increasing s uicidality through the 
introduction of LTx education in this patient population. Avoiding the question in our 
study will not prevent the thoughts/feelings from occurring and we determined that it is in 
the interest of patient safety to include the question  about suicidality and have a plan in 
place for responding in the case of this AE  of special interest . 
3.2.3  Recording  and assessment of adverse effects  
The Principal Investigator and/or research team staff will probe, via discussion with the 
participant, for the occurrence of AEs/UPs during each participant visit/call and record 
the information in the study’s records. AEs will be described by duration (st art and stop 
dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study procedure, or if 
unrelated, the cause.  
 
All observed or volunteered adverse events  (serious or non -serious)  and ab normal test 
findings , regardless o f treatment group , if applicable,  or suspected causal relationship to 
the investigational d evice  or, if applicable, other  study treatment  or diagnostic product (s) 
will be recorded in the subjects’ case histories .  For all adverse e ffects , sufficient 
information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate determination 
of the outcome of the event  (i.e., whether the e ffect should be classified as a serious 
adverse event ) and ; 2) an assessment of the casual relationship between the adverse e ffect 
and the investig ational d evice  or, if applicable, the other study treatment  or diagnostic 
product (s).     
3.2.5 Causality and severity assessment  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4.03, as modified for CF, will be used to assess and grade AE severity, 
including laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. If the experience is 
not covered in the modified criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 1 below will be used 
to grade severity. It should be p ointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity 
and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Table 1. Adverse Event Severity Grading  
STUDY00011578  Confidential  
 
 
Page 19 of 32 
 Severity (Toxicity 
Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no  
medical intervention or therapy required. The participant may be 
aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well. 
(e.g. fatigue during study visit ) 
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required. (e.g. psychological discomfort 
during study visit  that may lead to crying or other emotional 
displays)  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical interven tion/therapy 
required, hospitalizations possible. (e.g. profound symptoms of 
anxiety or depression prompting hospitalization)  
Life-threatening 
(4) The participant is at risk of death due to the adverse experience 
as it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
(e.g. suicidality that leads to a suicide attempt)  
The relationship of an AE to the study procedure should be assessed using the following 
the guidelines in Table 2.  
Table 2. Adverse Event Relationship to Study Procedure  
Relationship  
to study procedure  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known risk of procedure; or an event that follows a 
reasonable temporal sequence from performance of the 
procedure/testing; that follows a known or expected 
physiologic response to the procedure; that is confirmed by 
stopping or reducing the intensity of the procedure; and that is 
not explain ed by any other reasonable hypothesis.  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
performance of the procedure; that follows a known or 
expected physiologic response to the procedure; that is 
confirmed by stopping or reducing the i ntensity of the 
procedure; and that is unlikely to be explained by the known 
characteristics of the participant’s clinical state or by other 
interventions.  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
performance of the procedure; th at follows a known or 
expected physiologic response to the procedure; but that could 
readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no 
relationship to the study procedure.

 3.2.6 Reporting adverse effects to the responsible IRB  
All unanticipated problems that are SAEs (whether procedure related or not) that occur 
within 48 hours of a study visit will be documented and reviewed by the Investigator 
within 24 hours. SAEs that occur no t within 48 hours of a study visit  will be captured 
through patient’s self -report at the next study visit, but will not be reported. All SAEs 
within 48 hours of a study visit  will be sent the UW IRB within 24 hours. Reporting of 
unanticipated problems that  are SAEs to the IRB will be performed by the Investigator in 
accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies. Adequate documentation 
will be provided showing that the IRB w as properly notified. All episodes of reported 
suicidality documented on PHQ -9 administered during study visits, or patient report of 
suicidality between study visits, will be reported to the UW IRB within 24 hours. 
Additionally, the patient’s CF clinician w ill be contacted directly immediately via secure 
communication, by the PI (Dr. Ramos), and a study physician will establish a safety 
contract with the patient by phone in the interim within 8 hours of becoming aware of an 
abnormal result.  
5.0 MON ITORING PR OCEDURES  
Study staff at the University of Washington will be responsible for monitoring for data 
accuracy and completeness.  
7.0 INFORMED CONSENT  
Once an eligible participant  is identified from UW or at external sites via REDCap 
screening s urvey, a UW research coordinator will call the patient and verbal consent will 
be obtained. Before obtaining verbal consent, UW study staff will review the consent 
form with participants , allow time to answer any questions, and ensure participants 
demonstr ate an understanding of study requirements and agree to participat e.  
Study staff will ask the subject if they fully understand everything that was explained in 
the consent documents and if they have any questions. Consent documents will be 
emailed or mail ed to subjects if additional information is requested before verbal consent 
is obtained. Subjects will also be provided with a copy of the consent document for their 
records which includes study staff contact information if they have additional questions.  
Before obtaining verbal consent, all subjects will be told that this research study is 
voluntary and they are able to  withdraw at any time. They will be given contact 
information of the study staff if they decide they would like to withdraw or if they have  
any questions pertaining to their involvement in the study.  
8.0 IRB INFORMATION  
This pilot RCT was reviewed and approved by the University of Washington Human 
Subject’s Division IRB. Collaborating institution who distributed screening surveys for 
recruitment purposes were considered not engaged per HHS guidelines and did not 
require a dditional IRB approval from their local IRBs.  
STUDY00011578  Confidential  
 
 
Page 21 of 32 
 Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, consent forms, information concerning patient recruitment, 
payment or compensation procedures, or oth er pertinent information) will be submitted to 
the IRB.  The IRB’s written unconditional approval of the study protocol and the 
informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator before the study is 
initiated.   
Protocol and/or informed co nsent modifications or changes may not be initiated without 
prior written IRB approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the 
patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study.  Such modific ations will be submitted to the IRB and written verification that the 
modification was submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.   
The IRB must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for 
review; new information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the 
conduct of the study; an annual update and/or request for re -approval; and when the study 
has been completed.  
10.0 ADDITIONAL RECORDS AND REPORTS    
10.1 Data handling and record -keeping  
All study data will be maintained using REDCap. Only authorized individuals will be 
permitted to access study data.  
All investigators and staff involved will have completed human subjects' protection 
training, have HIPAA training, and be bound by the agreement of confide ntiality. A copy 
of the protocol will be given to all study team members and regular meetings will be held 
to discuss matters including questions and responsibilities relating to the study. All study 
databases will be maintained at the UW on password prote cted computers and backed up 
to an encoded password protected file. All procedures for the handling and analysis of 
data will be conducted using good clinical practices meeting FDA guidelines for the 
handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.  
10.2 Record maintenance and retention

of people living with CF? What information/information sources were meaningful, impactful, 
and salient (ToT or UNOS)?   
3. What could be potential barriers and facilitators to using ToT or UNOS? What is the 
acceptability and feasibility of ToT (or UNOS)? How could ToT be improved?  
Intro Session (prior to randomization) – 60-minute session  
Goals of interview:

Statistical Analysis Plan  
 Determination of the Predictors of Nocturnal Desaturation in Postpartum Women  
 
Primary Obj ective  
 To investigate the effect of the method of delivery (vaginal delivery vs. cesarean section) on 
oxygen saturation in the first postpartum night. The primary hypothesis is that nocturnal 
desaturation occurs more frequently in cesarean section compar ed with vaginal delivery.   
Secondary Objectives   
 To evaluate the effect of upper body position during sleep (45 degree elevated vs. nonelevated) 
on oxygen saturation in the first postpartum night. The secondary hypothesis is that an upper 
body positio n elevated by 45 degress is associated with a lower frequency of nocturnal 
desaturation.   
Outcomes  
 The primary outcome is duration of SpO2 below 90%. The secondary outcomes are Oxygen 
Desaturation Index (ODI, defined as number of oxygen desaturations by  at least 3 % per hour, 
pulse rate, mean and minimum SpO2).   
Statistical Methods  
 All analyses will be performed with pre -specified endpoints and statistical methods. The primary 
and secondary aim will be studied using Wilcoxon rank -sum tests for continu ous variables with 
non-normal distribution. As an a priori defined subgroup analysis we will assess the effect of the 
sleeping position on the primary outcome in subgroups stratified by delivery route.  Statistical 
analyses will be performed with Stata (St ataCorp) and SPSS (IBM Inc.) Japan, Tokyo, Japan). A 
two-tailed p -value of <0.05 will be regarded as statistically significant.

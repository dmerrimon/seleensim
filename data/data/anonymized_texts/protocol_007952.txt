1.0 Introduction 
1.1 Everolimus (RAD001) 
Everolimus (RAD001) is a novel or al derivative of rapamycin. Ev erolimus has been in 
clinical development since 1996 a s an immunosuppressant in soli d organ transplantation and 
has obtained marketing a uthorization (Certican®) for prophylaxis of rejection in renal and 
cardiac transplantation in a num ber of countries, including the  majority of the European 
Union. Everolimus has been in development for patients with var ious malignancies since 
2002. Everolimus 2.5mg, 5mg and 10m g tablets were  approved und er the trade name 
Afinitor® for patients with advan ced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment 
with Sutent® (sunitinib) or Nexav ar® (sorafenib) in the US, EU and several other countries 
and is undergoing registration in other regions worldwide.   Af initor® was also approved in 
2010 for the treatment of patients with subependymal giant cell  astrocytoma (SEGA) 
associated with tuberous scleros is (TS) who require therapeutic  intervention but are not 
candidates for curative surgic al resection.  Affinitor ® receiv ed approval for the treatment of 
postmenopausal women with advanc e hormone receptor-positive, HE R2-negative breast 
cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with 
letrolzole or ansastrozole. 
 Everolimus is being investigate d as an anticancer agent based o n its potential to act: 
 Directly on the tumor cells by inhi biting tumor cell growth and  proliferation  
 Indirectly by inhibiting angiogene sis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent 
inhibition of tumor cell HIF-1 activity, VEGF production and VE GF-induced proliferation 
of endothelial cells). The role of angiogenesis in the maintena nce of solid tumor growth is 
well established, and the mTOR pa thway has been implicated in t he regulation of tumor 
production of proangiogenic factors as well as modulation of VE GFR signaling in 
endothelial cells. At weekly and daily schedules a nd at various doses explored, RAD0001 is generally well 
tolerated. The most frequent adverse events (rash, mucositis, f atigue and headache) 
associated with everolimus therapy are manageable. Non-infectio us pneumonitis has been 
reported with mTOR inhibitors but  is commonly low-grade and rev ersible.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor):  The mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) has emerged as a critical regulator of the malignant phenotype in human cancers.1  
“The mTOR protein is a serine-th reonine kinase…central to a com plex intracellular 
signaling pathway and is involved in a number of important proc esses such as cell growth 
and proliferation, cellular me tabolism, autophagy, and angiogenesis. It responds to signals 
from the extracellular environment such as nutrient and growth factor supply, energy, and 
stress. Signaling through the pat hway is promoted when there is  an abundance of nutrients 
or energy and is down regulated in states of depletion and stre ss.”2  “mTOR exists within 
the cell complexed to the proteins involved in either raptor [T ORC1 pathway] or rictor 
[TORC2 pathway]. The mTOR/rictor protein complex is [less] responsive to inhibition by 
rapalogs and will not be discussed in detail except to mention its interaction with 
mTOR/raptor.”2  The TORC1 pathway “can be activated by various stimuli throug h 
different upstream molecules. Aft er stimulation, PI3K initiates a cascade that ultimately 
results in the phosphorylation a nd activation of Akt [T308]. Akt then acts via the tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC), consisting of the proteins TSC1 and TS C2, to exert its effect on 
mTOR. Phosphorylation of TSC2 by  Akt inhibits TSC2, thereby releasing the inhibition that 
TSC2 otherwise exerts on mTOR v ia inhibition of Rheb, an activator of mTOR.”2 
Downstream of [TORC1 pathway] are two main effectors, S6K1 and 4E-BP1, both of which control the translation of specific mRNAs and the synthesis of particular proteins.
2 
Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR ultimately results in the ini tiation of translation of 
certain mRNAs that have regulatory subunits in the 5'-untransla ted terminal regions, 
including those that are needed for cell cycle progression and are involved in cell cycle 
regulation. Phosphorylation and act ivation of S6K1 are also inv olved in cell growth and 
proliferation, possibly via tran slation of mRNAs that have a te rminal 5'-oligopyrimidine 
tract such as those that encode ribosomal proteins and elongation factors.  Importantly, S6K1 also has an inhibitory feedback function on the pathway by  phosphorylating and 
inhibiting insulin receptor substrate-1, thus reducing growth f actor–stimulated signaling 
through PI3K/Akt/mTOR. It also phosphorylates and inactivates BCL2 antagonist of cell death (BAD), a proapoptotic molecule. The numerous proteins who se translation is 
regulated through mTOR and its downstream targets include cycli n D1, MYC avian 
myelocytomatosis viral oncoge ne homolog (c-MYC), and hypoxia-in ducible factor-l  (HIF-
1) . ”

 Inhibitors of the mTor Pathway:  “Inhibitors of the [mTORC1]  pathway include sirolimus, 
temsirolimus, everolimus, and deferolimus. Sirolimus and the ra palogs exert their effects by 
the same mechanism. Each drug bind s to the intracellular bindin g protein FK506-binding 
protein (FKBP12) to form a complex, which then binds to mTOR at  the FKBP12–
rapamycin binding domain, interferi ng with its ability to signa l adequately to its 
downstream effectors. Exactly how t he sirolimus–FKBP12 complex interrupts mTOR 
signaling is not known, but it may i nvolve a destabilization of  the interaction between 
mTOR and raptor.”

Rituximab can act synergisti cally with mTOR inhibition: The SP49 cell line (a cell line 
established from MCL) which is sensitive to rituximab showed th e combination of 
rituximab with Everolimus to produc e a very strong synergistic effect on proliferation 
inhibition.3  In NHL mTORCH1 inhibitors have in-vitro  synergy with rituximab.4  
 
Cancer Stem Cells:  “Increasing data from several  human cancers suggest that neopl astic 
cells within individual tumors are functionally heterogeneous c ells despite their clonal

origins. In particular, the poten tial for long-term proliferati on appears to be restricted to 
subpopulations of “cancer stem cells” functionally defined by t heir capacity to undergo self-
renewal and give rise to differe ntiated cells that phenotypical ly recapitulate the original 
tumor.”5  Although most low grade B cell a nd MCL patients respond to in itial treatment, 
disease relapse is virtually universal even after autologous st em cell transplantation.6-11  The 
precise factors involved in tum or re-growth are unknown, but we  have recently found that 
tumorogenic potential is restri cted to distinct  populations of MCL cells or MCL cancer stem 
cells.12  We contest that novel agents  should be introduced that focus on the cancer stem 
cell. 
 mTor and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL):  MCL cells have a distinct cytogenetic 
translocation t(11;14) which j uxtaposes the cyclin D1 gene unde r the control of the 
immunoglobulin enhancer.  The cyclin s in general promote prolif eration by interacting with 
the cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin D1 appears to play a ro le in enhancing the 
proliferative capacity of MCL cells.  Dysregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 has also been implicated in MCL.  In additio n, MCL cells demonstrate def ects in apoptosis further 
contributing to the growth advant age of this cancer. From a cel l signaling perspective, the 
PI3-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway ha s been implicated in driving gene  expression in MCL.  
 Furthermore, our preliminary data s uggest that this pathway is important for growth and 
survival of Aldehyde 
high MCL stem cells. Not surprisingly, these pathways play a role i n 
promoting the expression of the cyclins, degrading p27 and prom oting survival over 
apoptosis.  In this regard there  have been several clinical tri als demonstrating activity of 
mTOR inhibitors in MCL.  Data on the efficacy and safety of tem sirolimus an intravenous 
mTOR inhibitor, as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL have been 
published.13   
 Thirty-five patients were tre ated with temsirolimus 250mg intra venously every week as a 
single agent. Patients had previously received a median of 3 pr ior therapies and 54% had 
been refractory to the last th erapy. The overall response rate was 38% (95% CI: 22% to 
56%), with one complete respons e and 12 partial responses. Medi an time to progression was 
6.5 months (95% CI: 2.9 to 8.3 months ). Hematologic toxicities were the most common: 
Grade 3 for 71% of the patients (25/35) and Grade 4 for 11% of the patients (4/35). 
Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent reason for dose reductio ns but typically resolved 
within 1 week. Non-hematologic to xicities of all grades include d hyperglycemia (91%), 
increased triglycerides (77%), m ucositis (71%), fatigue (66%), infections without 
concomitant neutropenia (63%), r ash (51%), nausea (49%), AST el evations (43%), 
hypercholesterolemia (40%) and s ensory neuropathy (37%). The au thors concluded that 
“single-agent temsirolimus has substantial antitumor activity i n relapsed MCL.”   
mTor and follicular cell lymphoma and CLL:  Preclinical models demonstrate that the 
mTOR pathway is aberrant in ma ny lymphoma subtypes, including f ollicular lymphoma. In 
follicular lymphoma, activated mTOR was necessary for malignant  cell survival in contrast 
to normal cells derived from activated tonsillar tissue.
14 In murine models, Akt 
overexpression confers an aggres sive and drug-resistant phenotype that is reversed by

mTOR inhibition.15  54 patients with relapsed aggressive follicular and CLL recei ved 
temsirolimus 25mg weekly for 2 m onths.  Three (5%) had grade III/IV pulmonary toxicity 
with temsirolimus pneumonitis.  Fol licular cell patients had a complete response rate of 
25.6% and CLL patients had a part ial response rate of 11%.16 
 
Possible Class effect of mTOR inhibition during ablative BMT:  Sirolimus during 
ablative allogeneic bone marrow transplant increases the risk o f veno-occlusive disease of 
the liver from 7.4% to 15.8%.17 
 1.1.2 Pre-clinical studies:  Everolimus acts as an inhibito r of interleukin and growth-factor-
dependent proliferation of cells. The only currently known targ et of everolimus is mTOR, a 
key regulatory protein affecting cell growth.
18 Everolimus exerts its activity through high 
affinity interaction with an int racellular receptor protein, th e immunophilin FKBP12. The 
FKBP12/everolimus complex subse quently interacts with the mTOR protein kinase, 
inhibiting downstream signaling e vents involved in regulation o f the G1 to S-phase 
transition.  
The main known functions of mTOR include: • Function as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors, energy and nutrient levels, facilitating 
cell-cycle progression from G1 - S  phase in appropriate growth conditions. 
• Regulation of protein synthesis important for tumor cell prol iferation and angiogenesis 
through inactivating eukaryotic  initiation factor 4E binding proteins and activating the 40S 
ribosomal S6 kinases (e.g. p70S6K1) . For example, activation of the mTOR pathway leads 
to a) increased production of pro- angiogenic factors (e.g. VEGF ) in tumors b) tumor, 
endothelial and smooth muscle cel l growth and proliferation. 
The PI3K-mTOR pathway itself is  frequently activated in many hu man cancers, and 
oncogenic transformation may sen sitize tumor cells to mTOR inhi bitors. The regulation of 
mTOR signaling is complex and inv olves positive regulators such  as AKT that 
phosphorylate and inactivate negative regulators such as the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 
(TSC1/TSC2). In summary, mTOR has pleiotropic functions; hence,  the activities of 
everolimus may vary depending upon cell type. The mTOR inhibitory activities presumably contribute to the ant iproliferative activity of 
everolimus against tumor cell li nes. However, everolimus may al so exert an antitumor effect 
through the inhibition of angiogenesis. Indeed, both rapamycin and everolimus potently 
inhibit proliferati on of endothelial cells
19 and have antiangiogenic activity in vivo.19,20 
Exactly which molecular determin ants predict res ponsiveness of tumor cells to everolimus 
is still unclear. Currently, the a ctivation status of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70 S6K pathway 
may be indicative of responsiveness to rapamycins. For example,  pre-clinically, loss of 
PTEN or constitutive/hyper-activ ation of AKT has been suggested to sensitize tumors to the 
effects of inhibition of mTOR20. Also, clinically, it has b een suggested that high p70S6K 
activation in baseline GBM tumor  samples may predict a patient population more likely to 
derive benefit from mTOR inhibition.21

The antiproliferative effects of  everolimus were investigated i n a mixed panel of 48 
different tumor cell lines (incl uding breast, colon, epidermoid , glioblastoma, lung, 
melanoma, prostate and renal). T he majority of tumor cell lines  were highly sensitive to the 
anti-proliferative effects of e verolimus while a few others app eared intrinsically insensitive, 
or ‘resistant’ (IC50 range 0.2 to 4125 nM).22 The median IC50 value of the 48 cell lines was 
0.5 nM. Similar findings have been observed for rapamycin.23 Everolimus was also shown 
to have activity in in acute  myeloid leukemia cells,24 mantle cell lymphoma cells,3 adult T-
cell leukemia cells,25 diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells.4  
Everolimus was also evaluated  in a clonogenic assay using cells  derived from 81 patient 
derived tumor xenografts never cultured in vitro (11 human tumor types with 3 to 24 tumors 
each: bladder, colon, gastric, N SCLC, SCLC, breast, ovary, pancreatic, renal, melanoma, 
and pleuramesothelioma). Everolimus inhibited colony formation in a concentration-
dependent manner (mean IC 50: 175 nM). In addition, normal hematopoietic stem cells were 
found to be relatively insensitive  to everolimus, with an IC 50 about 15 fold higher than the 
tumor lines. 
Everolimus is a highly specific inhibitor of mTOR, which is aff orded by high-affinity 
binding to the protein FKBP-12 (IC 50 of 5.3 nM) similar to that of rapamycin. Similar 
potency of rapamycin and everolimus was also demonstrated at forming the mTOR / FKBP-
12 tertiary complex in vitro. Specificity was demonstrated by a lack of inhibitory activity against 10 other protein kinases  at concentrations up to 10 μM.  The antiproliferative effects 
of everolimus were investigat ed in a mixed panel of 48 differen t tumor cell lines (including 
breast, colon, epidermoid, gli oblastoma, lung, melanoma, prosta te and renal).  
Everolimus was also shown to have activity in human pancreatic neuroendocrine cells, where induction of apoptosis was reported,
26 as well as in acute myeloid leukemia cells,24 
mantle cell lymphoma cells,3 adult T-cell leukemia cells,25 diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
cells,4 pancreatic tumor cells,27 ovarian cancer cells20,28 and hepatocellular carcinoma 
cells.29 Everolimus was also evaluated i n a clonogenic assay using cell s derived from 81 
patient derived tumor xenografts ne ver cultured in vitro (11 hu man tumor types with 3 to 24 
tumors each: bladder, colon, gast ric, NSCLC, SCLC, breast, ovary, pancreatic, renal, 
melanoma, and pleuramesothelioma). Everolimus inhibited colony formation in a concentration-dependent manner (mean IC
50: 175 nM). In addition, normal hematopoietic 
stem cells were found to be rela tively insensitive to everolimu s, with an IC 50 about 15 fold 
higher than the tumor lines. 
 Everolimus was effective and we ll tolerated against subcutaneou s (s.c.) tumors established 
from a variety of tumor cell lin es of diverse histotypes (NSCLC , pancreatic, colon, 
melanoma, epidermoid), inclu ding a PgP170-overexpressing, multi-drug resistant tumor 
line. Typically, the antitumor ac tivity of everolimus was that of reduction of tumor growth 
rates rather than producing regress ions or stable disease although, in the case of A549 and 
NCI-H596 lung and ARJ42 pancreatic tumors, regressions could be obtained. These effects 
occurred within the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg/kg, p.o., once p er day. The change in tumor 
volume of the treated mice di vided by the change in tumor volum e of control mice (T/C)

typically ranged from approximately 15 to 50% at optimal doses.  A marked loss of 
antitumor activity occurred when tumor-bearing mice were treate d with everolimus once per 
week, but improved moderately wit h twice per week dosing. Antit umor activity of 
everolimus has also been demonstrated in mouse models of ovaria n,20 breast30 and 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors.31 
 
Pre-clinical safety:  In safety pharmacology studies, e verolimus was devoid of relev ant 
effects on vital organ functions i ncluding the cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous 
systems. Everolimus had no effects on QT interval. Furthermore, everolimus showed no 
antigenic potential. Although eve rolimus passes the blood-brain  barrier, there was no 
indication of relevant changes i n the behavior of rodents, even after single oral doses up to 
2000 mg/kg or after repeated adm inistration at up to 40 mg/kg/d ay. 
The preclinical safety profile of everolimus was assessed in mi ce, rats, minipigs, monkeys, 
and rabbits. The major target or gans were male and female repro ductive systems (testicular 
tubular degeneration, reduced spe rm content in epididymides and  uterine atrophy) in several 
species; lungs (increased alveo lar macrophages) in rats and mic e; and eyes (lenticular 
anterior suture line opacities) in rats only. Minor kidney chan ges were seen in the rat 
(exacerbation of age-re lated lipofuscin in tubular epithelium, increases in hydronephrosis) 
and mouse (exacerbation of background lesions). There was no in dication of kidney toxicity 
in monkeys or minipigs. 
Genotoxicity studies covering r elevant genotoxicity endpoints s howed no evidence of 
clastogenic or mutagenic activity. Administration of everolimus  for up to 2 years did not 
indicate any oncogenic potential in mice and rats up to the hig hest doses, corresponding 
respectively to 4.2 and 0.2 times t he estimated clinical exposu re. In reproduction studies, 
everolimus was toxic to the con ceptus in rats and rabbits, and was considered potentially 
teratogenic in rats. It is there fore recommended that women of childbearing potential should 
use highly effective contraceptive measures during the entire t reatment period and for 8 
weeks thereafter.  It is not know n whether everolimus is excret ed in human milk. In animal 
studies, everolimus and/or its m etabolites were readily transferred into the milk of lactating 
rats. Therefore women who are taking everolimus should not breastfeed.  Everolimus Pharmacokinetics:  Everolimus is rapidly absorbed with a median tmax of 1-2 
hours. The steady-state AUC0-τ is  dose-proportional over the dose range between 5 to 70 
mg in the weekly regimen and 5 and 10 mg in the daily regimen. Steady-state was achieved 
within two weeks with the dail y dosing regimen. Cmax is dose-pr oportional between 5 and 
10 mg for both the weekly and daily regimens. At doses of 20 mg /week and higher, the 
increase in Cmax is less tha n dose proportional. In healthy sub jects, high fat meals reduced 
systemic exposure to everolimu s 10 mg (as measured by AUC) by 22% and the peak plasma 
concentration Cmax by 54%. Light fat meals reduced AUC by 32% a nd Cmax by 42%. 
Food, however, had no apparent eff ect on the post absorption ph ase concentration-time 
profile.

The blood-to-plasma ratio of evero limus, which is concentration -dependent over the range 
of 5 to 5,000 ng/mL, is 17% to 73%. The amount of everolimus co nfined to the plasma is 
approximately 20% at blood concentrations observed in cancer pa tients given everolimus 10 
mg/day. Plasma protein binding i s approximately 74% both in hea lthy subjects and in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  
 Everolimus is a substrate of C YP3A4 and a substrate and moderat e inhibitor of PgP. 
Following oral administration, everolimus is the main circulating component in human blood and is considered to contribute the majority of the overa ll pharmacologic activity.  No 
specific excretion studies have  been undertaken in cancer patie nts; however, data available 
from the transplantation sett ing found the drug to be mainly el iminated through the feces. 
There was a significant correlation between AUC0-τ and pre-dose  trough concentration at 
steady-state on the daily regime n. The mean elimination half-life of everolimus is 
approximately 30 hours.  
1.1.3 Clinical Experience with Everolimus: Everolimus has been i n clinical development 
since 1996 as an immunosuppressant  in solid organ transplantati on and was approved in 
Europe in 2003 under the trade name  Certican®, for the preventi on of organ rejection in 
patients with renal and cardiac transplantation. Additional non -oncologic indications 
currently being explored are wet age-related macular degenerati on (AMD) and autosomal 
dominant polycystic kidn ey disease (ADPKD).  
In oncology, everolimus has been i n clinical development since 2002 for patients with 
various hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies as a single agent or in combination 
with antitumor agents. Malignanc ies that are currently being ev aluated in Novartis 
sponsored studies include the f ollowing: metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), breast 
cancer, gastroenteropancreatic ne uroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET),  mantle cell lymphoma 
and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), hepatocellular cance r (HCC), gastric cancer, 
and lung cancer. In addition, treat ment of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) 
associated subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) and Angio myolypoma is also 
being evaluated. 
Everolimus 2.5 mg, 5mg and 10mg tablets were approved under the  trade name Afinitor® 
for patients with advanced renal  cell carcinoma (RCC) after fai lure of treatment with 
Sutent® (sunitinib) or Nexavar® (sorafenib)  in the US, EU and several other countries and 
is undergoing registration in othe r regions worldwide.  Afinito r®® was also recently 
approved in the US for the treatment of patients with subependy mal giant cell astrocytoma 
(SEGA) associated with tuberous s clerosis (TS) who require therapeutic intervention but are 
not candidates for curative sur gical resection.   Affinitor ® r eceived approval for the 
treatment of postmenopausal women with advance hormone receptor -positive, HER2-
negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with ex emestane, after failure of 
treatment with letrolz ole or ansastrozole.

Clinical Experience of Everolimus in lymphoma:  everolimus, an oral mTOR inhibitor, 
was tested at 10 mg qd in a Phase II study for patients with a number of different types of 
relapsed or refractor y lymphomas – includ ing aggressive, indole nt and uncommon 
lymphomas32,33 . Thirty-seven (37) patients were  treated in the aggressive ly mphoma group 
- 20 (54%) with diffuse large B- cell (DLBC), 14 (38%) with MCL, 2 high grade, and 1 
follicular grade III. Patients were eligible to enter if they h ad measurable disease and had 
met the following hematologic parameters: ANC ≥ 1.0 x 109/L, pl atelets ≥ 75.0 x 109/L and 
hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/L. The median a ge was 72 years (range, 45-92).  Patients had previously 
received a median of 4 prior ther apies (range, 1-15). Prior stem cell transplant was allowed. 
The median treatment duration with Everolimus was 2 cycles (ran ge 1-16+). The overall 
response rate was 32% (12/37; 95% CI: 20-49%) with 1 complete r esponse and 11 partial 
responses. The overall response ra te in the MCL patients was 29 % (4/14); including one 
who received Everolimus for more than 14 cycles, while maintain ing PR. The median time 
to progression for all 37 patient s was 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.1 - 8.7). The median duration 
of response for the 12 responders was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.3 - 9.2). Three patients are currently maintaining a response with a median of 10.5 months (2.9-15.6+ months). Everolimus was well tolerated. T he incidence of grade 3 anemia,  neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia in this heav ily pretreated patient population was 11%, 16%, and 30%, 
respectively. Two patients devel oped grade 4 neutropenia. Grade 2 hypercholesterolemia 
occurred in 11%; grade 2 hypergly cemia in 16%; grade 3 hypergly cemia in 11% of the 
patients. One patient had gr ade 4 hypertrigly ceridemia.  
 In the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin’s disease, everolimus dose d at 10mg daily on a 
monthly cycle, the ORR was  47%.  Ten of 19 patients had dose re ductions or treatment 
delays.  The median number of cyc les at 10mg daily was five (ra nge 1-20).

The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive  Cancer center has pioneered the  concept of high-dose 
cyclophosphamide without stem ce ll rescue for over a decade.  T his high-dose consolidative 
treatment was developed for two main reasons.  
It does not require stem cell rescue: it eliminates the potenti al of cancer re-
introduction at time of stem ce ll rescue.  Moreover, as this high-dose therapy does 
not require stem cell rescue a ll the components of autologous s tem cell transplant: 
collection, preservati on and re-infusion are eliminated making this therapy a more 
widely available treatment modality.  
 
Tolerability: not only are the m ajority of the patients treated  with this modality 
served in the outpatient setti ng, many have had a performance s tatus or advanced 
age not otherwise well suited for  an autologous stem cell transplant.   
 
We put forward that the cytore duction achieved by high-dose con solidative 
cyclophosphamide represents the  ideal foundation for the integr ation of novel molecularly 
targeted compounds for these lymphomas.  
81 adults received, as outpa tients, rituximab [375mg/m
2 days 1, 4, 8, 11, 45, 52] and 
cyclophosphamide [50mg/kg days 15-18 with concurrent mesna] and pegfilgrastim 
(day +20).  Forty-two participants had low grade B cell lymphom a [grade I/II 
follicular (69%), transformed lymphoma (17%), other (15%)]: 45%  were treated 
without measurable disease.  Thi rty-nine had mantle cell lympho ma: 82% were 
treated without measurable diseas e.  All achieved hematopoietic  recovery; 46% 
required brief hospitalizations.  T he EFS for low grade B cell patients at 3 and 5 
years was 49% and 40% with an overa ll survival (OS) at 3 and 5 years of 86% and 
72%.   The 3 and 5 year EFS for MCL patients was 57% and 39% with a 3 and 5 year OS 92% and 62%. 
 
Hodgkin’s data: Rituximab, high dos e cy, and GM-CSF based immun otherapy for 
relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma:  Thi s phase I/II, single-instituti on trial for relapsed 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma has ju st completed accrual of its pl anned 30 
patients.  Clinical outcomes of this platform, which was develo ped as a potentially 
less toxic alternative to autologous BMT, are encouraging.  In the first 25 patients, 
whose median time between first -line therapy completion and rel apse was 12 
months, actuarial event-free su rvival is 79% at 1 year and 63% at 2 and 3 years 
following high-dose cyclophosphamide; overall survival is 100% at 2 years and 92% 
at 3 years.  These early results a re comparable to what is seen  with autologous 
BMT.  The toxicity profile has  been manageable, and there has b een no treatment-
related mortality.  Median time t o neutrophil recovery after hi gh dose 
cyclophosphamide was 17 days, and 21 days for platelet recovery  with 5 patients not

3.2.4    Monitoring of everolimus suspected toxicities : Patients whose treatment is 
interrupted or permanently disc ontinued due to an adverse event  or abnormal 
laboratory value suspected to be r elated to everolimus must be followed at least 
weekly until the adverse event or  abnormal laboratory completely resolves or returns 
to baseline as clinically appropr iate.  For patients whose trea tment is on hold, labs 
will be monitored every two weeks while on hold.  
 
3.2.5   Known Undesirable Side Effects of everolimus 
 Overall, safety data available from completed, controlled and uncontrolled studies 
indicate that everolimus is generally well tolerated at weekly or daily dose 
schedules. The safety profile is characterized by manageable ad verse events (AEs). 
These AEs are generally re versible and non-cumulative. 
Adverse events most frequently observed with everolimus are sto matitis, rash, 
diarrhea, fatigue, infections, as thenia, nausea, peripheral ede ma, decreased 
appetite, headache,dysgeusia, epistaxis, mucosal inflammation, pneumonitis, 
weight decreased, vomiting,prur itus, cough, dyspnea, dry skin, nail disorder, and 
pyrexia. Overall, the most fre quently observed laboratory abnor malities include 
decreased hematology parameters including hemoglobin, lymphocyt es, platelets, 
and neutrophils (or collectively as pancytopenia); increased cl inical chemistry 
parameters including cholesterol,  triglycerides, glucose, aspartate transaminases, 
creatinine, alanine transaminases , and bilirubin; and decreased  clinical chemistry 
parameters including phosphate and potassium.  The majority of these AEs have 
been of mild to moderate severity (NCI CTC grade 1-2).  
Everolimus has immunosuppressive  properties and may predispose patients to 
bacterial, fungal, viral or prot ozoan infections, including inf ections with 
opportunistic pathogens. Localize d and systemic infections, inc luding pneumonia, 
other bacterial infections, inva sive fungal infections, such as  aspergillosis or 
candidiasis and viral infections  including reactivation of hepa titis B virus, have been 
described in patients taking evero limus. Some of these infectio ns have been severe 
(e.g. leading to sepsis, respirato ry or hepatic failure) and occasionally have had a 
fatal outcome. 
Physicians and patients should be a ware of the increased risk o f infection with 
everolimus. Treat pre-existing in fections prior to starting tre atment with everolimus. 
While taking everolimus, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of infection; if a 
diagnosis of infection is made, i nstitute appropriate treatment  promptly and consider 
interruption or discon tinuation of everolimu s. If a diagnosis o f invasive systemic 
fungal infection is made, discontinue everolimus and treat with  appropriate 
antifungal therapy. 
 
Reactivation of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer 
receiving chemotherapy (Yeo 2004). Sporadic cases of Hepatitis B reactivation have 
also been seen in this setting with  everolimus. Use of antivira ls during anti-cancer 
Confidential 
Clinical study protocol number: J1228   Page 23 
Version Date: May 7, 2018    
IRB study Number: NA_00067315  
 
therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of Hepatitis B virus reactivation and 
associated morbidity and mort ality (Loomba 2008). A detailed as sessment of 
Hepatitis B/C medical history a nd risk factors must be done for all patients at 
screening, with testing performed prior to the first dose of ev erolimus. Addendum 8 
details the action to be taken for a patient with a positive ba seline hepatitis B result.  
For hepatitis B reactivation, definition, and management guidel ines, please see 
Addendum 9.  For patients who have already received study drug prior to the 
approval of Protocol Versi on date February 18, 2014, HBV-DNA te sting will be 
performed at the patient’s next visit, and the result will be regarded as baseline.   
 Hypersensitivity reactions m anifested by symptoms including, bu t not limited to, 
anaphylaxis, dyspnea, flushing, chest pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the 
airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment) have  been observed with 
everolimus. 
 
Hyperglycemia has been reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is 
recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and period ically thereafter. Optimal 
glycemic control should be achie ved before starting a patient o n everolimus. Mouth ulcers, 
stomatitis and oral mucositis hav e been seen in patients treate d with everolimus. In such 
cases topical treatments are recommended, but alcohol- or perox ide-containing 
mouthwashes should be avoided as they may exacerbate the condit ion. Antifungal agents 
should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed. 
Cases of renal failure (includi ng acute renal failure), some wi th fatal outcome, 
occurred in patients treated with everolimus.  Renal function o f patients should be 
monitored particularly where patie nts have additional risk factors that may further 
impair renal function.  Elevations of serum creatinine, usually  mild, have been 
reported in clinical trials. Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein, or serum creatinine , is recommended 
prior to the start of everolimus  therapy and periodically there after. 
Decreased hemoglobin, lymphocytes,  platelets and neutrophils ha ve been reported in 
clinical trials. Mon itoring of complete bl ood count is recommended prior to the start 
of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter. 
Everolimus is not recommended in p atients with severe hepatic impairment, (Child-
Pugh class C). 
The use of live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live 
vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia and hypocalcemia have been 
reported as serious adverse rea ctions. Electrolytes should be monitored in patients 
treated with everolimus. 
Addendums 4-7 provide recommendati ons for the management of pat ients, with 
suspected drug toxicities while on treatment with everolimus.

The initial dose of everolimus will be 2.5mg orally daily for a  total of one year to 
maintain a target trough con centration between 3-15 ng/mL 
Everolimus should be administered orally once daily, preferably in the morning, at 
the same time every day with or without food.  
Everolimus tablets should be swa llowed whole wit h a glass of wa ter.  
The tablets must not be chewed or crushed.   If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose

Everolimus will be provided by Novartis. Everolimus is formulat ed as tablets for 
oral administration of 2.5mg, 5mg, and 10mg strength.  
Dose modification will occur as per Addendum 4. 
 Everolimus can still be administ ered per protocol even if Ritu ximab treatment 
is on hold. 
3.3.2 Concomitant therapy 
Rituximab will be administered con comitantly with everolimus as  per the dose and 
schedule below.  Instructions for  administration of Bactrim and  Valtrex for PCP 
prophylaxis and herpes prophylaxis  treatment, respectively, are  also listed.   
 Patients will be instructed not t o take any additional medicati ons (including over-
the-counter products) during the course of the study without pr ior consultation with 
the investigator.  At each vis it, the patient will be asked abo ut any new medications 
he/she is or has taken after  the start of the study drug.  Additional information about 
clinically relevant drug inte ractions can be found in Addendums  1-3. 
 All Concomitant medications/sig nificant non-drug therapies take n ≤30 days prior to 
the start and after start of study drug, including physical the rapy and blood 
transfusions, should be recorded.  
  Rituximab administration 
Dose and schedule: 375mg/m
2 day +1and then every 90 days f or 1 year (a total of 4 
infusions) Rituximab will not be given unless the patient’s ANC is greater than 1.5. 
Administration as per instituti onal standard, with infusions 90  days apart, regardless 
of the study date that it was gi ven.  For example, if Rituximab  is given on day 95 
instead of 90, the next infusion will be given on day 185, not 180. 
Rituximab can still be administe red per protocol even if Everol imus treatment is on 
hold. 
It is not considered a protocol deviation if Rituximab is withh eld due to Rituximab-
induced cytopenias.  There is no limit to the number of Rituxim ab doses that can be 
held.  For example, some patients may not get any doses of Ritu ximab, or possibly 
only one dose, if their counts have  a history of extreme sensit ivity to Rituximab.

3.4.3 Efficacy assessments 
Response Evaluation:  Conventional response criteria are modeled after the 1999 Inte rnational 
Working Group criteria for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.34  Disease sites that  are considered non-
measurable, such as malignant  effusions, ascites, or bony lesio ns, will be considered in the 
overall response. 
Complete Response:  Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiogra phic 
evidence of disease. Nonspecific laboratory measures  such as LDH or ESR are not included in the response 
assessment.   All lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed to normal size (< 1.5 cm in their 
greatest transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy) . Previously involved nodes 
that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter must ha ve decreased to < 1 cm, or by 
> 75% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters (SPD).   The spleen, if previously enlarged due to lymphoma, must have regressed in size and must 
not be palpable. Macroscopic nodules in any organs should no lo nger be present. Other 
organs considered to be enlarg ed before therapy due to lymphoma, such as liver and 
kidneys, must have decreased in size.  
Negative bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, if bone marrow previo usly involved 
Partial response (PR):  
> 50% decrease in the sum of t he products of greatest diameter (SPD) of the six largest (or 
fewer) dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses sh ould be a) clearly 
measurable in at least two perpe ndicular dimensions; b) be from as disparate regions of the 
body as possible; and c) include med iastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease when 
involved.   
Regression of splenic and he patic nodules by > 50% in SPD   
Bone marrow assessment is not relevant for determination of a P R   
No sites of new or progressive disease  Stable disease (SD) : less than a PR but is not progressive disease (see below), and must be 
maintained for a minimum of 4 weeks

Standard Definitions of Disease and Survival Endpoints 
Overall survival (OS)  will be measured from registra tion to the time of death from a ny 
cause or last patient contact.

Event-free survival (EFS)  is defined as the interval fro m registration to the date of first 
objective disease progression, de ath from any cause, or last pa tient evaluation. Patients 
who have not progressed or died will be censored at the last da te they were assessed and 
deemed relapse-free. 
Failure-free survival (FFS)  is defined as the interval fro m registration to the date of first 
objective disease progression or last patient evaluation. Patients who have not progressed, 
or patients who have died without e vidence of lymphoma progress ion, will be censored at 
the last date they were assessed and deemed progression- or rel apse-free. 
Time to tumor progression (TTP)  is defined as the interval from the date the patient 
was last found to be progression-f ree, to the date of first obj ective disease progression. 
 
3.4.4 Safety assessments 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording  ad verse events that are 
grade 3 and above and all serious a dverse events,  the regular m onitoring of hematology 
and blood chemistry values, regular  measurement of vital signs and the performance of 
physical examinations.   
 These assessments should be performed within ± 2 days of the scheduled day of assessment 
except for adverse events that will be evaluated continuously t hrough the study.  Toxicity will be 
scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for  toxicity and adverse event r eporting.  A copy of the 
CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloade d from the CTEP homepage (htt p://ctep.info.nih.gov).  
All adverse clinical  experiences, whether observed by the inves tigator or reported by the patient, 
must be recorded, with details a bout the duration and intensity  of each episode, the action taken 
with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each 
adverse experience for its re lationship to the test drug and for its seriousness. 
 The investigator must appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical significance.  If 
any abnormal laboratory result is  considered clinically signifi cant, the investigator must provide 
details about the action taken with respect to the test drug an d about the patient’s outcome. 
 
3.4.4.1 Adverse Events 
Information about adverse events  that are grade 3 or above, whether volunteered by the 
subject, discovered by investigator  questioning, or detected th rough physical examination, 
laboratory test or other means, w ill be collecte d and recorded and followed as appropriate. 
An adverse event is the appear ance or worseni ng of any undesira ble sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after  starting the study drug even if the event is not considered 
to be related to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases presen t before starting study drug 
are only considered adverse events  if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal

laboratory values or test result s constitute adverse events onl y if they induce c linical signs 
or symptoms, are considered clin ically significant, or require therapy. 
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non-direct ive questioning of the 
patient at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are 
volunteered by the patient duri ng or between visits or through physical examination, 
laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as possible, each  adverse event should be 
evaluated to determine: 
1. the severity grade (mild, modera te, severe) or (grade 1-4) its relationship to the study 
drug(s) (suspected/not suspected) 
2. its duration (start and end dates  or if continuing at final exa m) 
3. action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/tempo rarily interrupted; study 
drug permanently discontinued due t o this adverse event; concom itant medication taken; 
non-drug therapy given; hospitaliz ation/prolonged hospitalizati on) 
4. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) 
All adverse events should be tre ated appropriately. Such treatm ent may include changes in 
study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stopping 
concomitant treatments, changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospitalization, 
or any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse e vent is detected, it should be 
followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspe cted relationship to the study 
drug, the interventions require d to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about common side e ffects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigators’ Broc hure. This information should b e included in the patient 
informed consent and should be di scussed with the patient durin g the study as needed. 
 
3.4.4.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event is a sign, symptom or medical condition  which: 
 is fatal or life-threatening 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 requires inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless  
hospitalization is for: 
 routine treatment or monitoring of  the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition   
 elective or pre-planned treatme nt for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not w orsened since the start of study drug 
 treatment on an eme
rgency outpatient basis for an event not ful filling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission

 social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deteriora tion in the patient’s 
general condition 
 is medically significant, i.e., de fined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may 
require medical or surgical in tervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events: 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring 
 after the patient has provided informed consent and until 4 wee ks after the patient has 
stopped study treatment/participation 
 after the patient is randomized and until 4 weeks after the pat ient has stopped study 
treatment 
 after the patient begins taking study drug and until 4 weeks af ter the patient has stopped 
study treatment  after protocol-specified procedures begin (e.g., placebo run-in , washout period, double-
blind treatment, etc.) and until  4 weeks after the patient has stopped study treatment 
 after the start of any period in w hich the study protocol inter feres with the standard 
medical treatment given to a pati ent (e.g., treatment withdrawal during washout period, 
change in treatment to a fixed dos e of concomitant medication) and until 4 weeks after the 
patient has stopped study treatment 
must be reported to Novartis  within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any SAEs 
experienced after this 4-wee k period should only be reported to Novartis if the investigator 
suspects a causal relationshi p to the study drug. Recurrent epi sodes, complications, or 
progression of the initial SAE m ust be reported as follow-up to  the original episode within 
24 hours of the investigator recei ving the follow-up informatio n. An SAE occurring at a 
different time interval or othe rwise considered completely unre lated to a previously reported 
one should be reported separately as a new event. 
The investigator must assess a nd record the relationship of each SAE to each specific study 
drug (if there is more than one study drug), complete the SAE R eport in English, and send 
the completed, signed form  by fax (877-778-9739) within 24 hours to the Novartis Drug 
Safety and Epidemiology Department.  The original copy of the SAE Re port and the fax confirmation sh eet must be kept within the 
Trial Master File a t the study site. 
Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form 
was sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow-up to the previously 
reported SAE and giving the date of  the original report. Each r e-occurrence, complication, 
or progression of the original event should be reported as a fo llow-up to that event 
regardless of when it occurs. T he follow-up information should describe whether the event 
has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether t he blind was broken or not (if 
applicable), and whether the pati ent continued or withdrew from study participation.

If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s B rochure or Package Insert 
(new occurrence) and is thought to b e related to the Novartis s tudy drug, a Drug Safety and 
Epidemiology Department associate may urgently require further information from the 
investigator for Health Authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator 
Notification (IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that 
this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) 
will be collected and reported t o the competent authorities and  relevant ethics committees in 
accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC  or as per national regulatory requirements in 
participating countries. 
 
3.4.5 Novartis instructions for rap id notification of serious a dverse events  
The principal investigator has the obligation to report all ser ious adverse events to the FDA, 
IRB, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department (DS&E). All events reported to the FDA  by the investigator are to be fi led utilizing the Form FDA 3500A 
(MedWatch Form).  
All events must be reported, by FAX (877-778-9739), to Novartis  Pharmaceuticals DS&E 
Department within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  This includes serious, related, 
labeled (expected) and serious , related, unlabeled (unexpected)  adverse experiences. All deaths 
during treatment or within 30 days following completion of acti ve protocol therapy must be 
reported within 5 working days. 
Any serious adverse event occurri ng after the patient has provided informed consent and 
until 4 weeks after the patient ha s stopped study participation  must be reported. This 
includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with  the standard medical 
treatment given to a patient (e .g. treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in 
treatment to a fixed dose of  concomitant medication). 
Serious adverse events occurr ing more than 4 weeks after study discontinuation need only 
be reported if a relationship t o the Novartis study drug (or th erapy) is suspected.  
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary S uspects (Concomitant Medication s), all serious adverse 
experiences will be forwarded t o the product manufacturer by th e investigator. 
 3.4.6  Pregnancy and assessments of fertility for Everolimus 
 There are no adequate data from t he use of everolimus in pregnant women. Studies 
inanimals have shown reproductive toxicity effects including em bryo-toxicity and feto-
toxicity. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Everolimus should not be given to 
pregnant women unless the potential benefit outweighs the poten tial risk to the fetus. If a 
pregnancy occurs while on study treatment, the newborn will be followed for at least 12 
months.

It is not known whether everolimus is excreted in breast milk.  However, in animal studies, 
everolimus and/or its metabolites readily passed into the milk of lactating rats.  Women 
taking everolimus should therefore not breast-feed. 
 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of 
becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception duri ng the study and for 8 
weeks after stopping treatment.  H ighly effective contraception  is defined as either: 
 Total abstinence: When this is i n line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
[Periodic abstinence (e.g., cale ndar, ovulation, s ymptothermal,  post-ovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception] 
 Sterilization: have had surgica l bilateral oophorectomy (with o r without hysterectomy) or 
tubal ligation at least six week s before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy 
alone, only when the reproductive s tatus of the woman has been confirmed by follow up 
hormone level assessment 
 Male partner sterilization (wit h the appropriate post-vasectomy  documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejacula te). [For female subjects on the  study, the vasectomised 
male partner should be the sole  partner for that subject]. 
 Use of a combination of any tw o of the following (a+b or a+c or  b+c): 
a. Use of oral, injected, implante d or other hormonal methods of c ontraception 
b. Placement of an intrauterine devi ce (IUD) or intrauterine syste m (IUS) 
c. Barrier methods of contraception: C ondom or Occlusive cap (diap hragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicid al foam/gel/film/cream/vagin al suppository 
 In case of use of oral contrac eption, women should have been stable on the oral agent 
before taking study treatment. 
 
Male Contraception 
Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse whil e taking the drug and for 8 
weeks after stopping treatment and should not father a child in  this period. 
A condom is required to be used also by vasectomised men in ord er to prevent delivery of 
the drug via seminal fluid. 
Female partners of male patients must also be advised to use on e of the following 
contraception methods: Use of (1) oral, injected, implanted or other hormonal methods of 
contraception, or (2) intrauter ine device (IUD) or intrauterine  system (IUS), or (3) prior 
male/female sterilization. 
 
Fertility

The potential for everolimus t o cause infertility in male and f emale patients is unknown. 
However, menstrual irregulariti es, secondary amenorrhea and ass ociated luteinizing 
hormone (LH)/follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) imbalance has b een observed.  Based on 
non-clinical findings, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with 
everolimus. 
 
Pregnancy Reporting 
Preclinical data regarding repr oductive toxicity is described i n the most recent Investigator 
Brochure.  The potential reproductive risk for humans is unknow n.  Women of childbearing 
potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception methods while they are 
receiving everolimu and up to 8 week s after treatment has been stopped. 
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the pa tient is on study treatment 
must be reported to Novartis  within 24 hours of learning of its  occurrence.  The pregnancy 
should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneo us or voluntary 
termination, details of the bi rth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  The n ewborn will be followed 
for at least 12 months. 
 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form  and reported by the investigator 
to the oncology Novartis Drug Safe ty and Epidemiology Departmen t (DS&E).  Pregnancy follow‐up 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an asses sment of the possible 
relationship to the study treatment and any pregnancy outcome.   Any SAE experienced during 
pregnancy must be reported  on the SAE Report Form.  
4 Protocol amendments, or changes in study conduct

Internal Monitoring Plan  
The PI will review data to assure the validity of data, as well  as, the safety of the 
subjects.  The PI will monitor th e progress of the trial, revie w safety reports and 
clinical trial efficacy endpoints –on an ongoing basis to confi rm that the safety 
outcomes favor continuation of the study. 
 The PI will be responsible for maintaining the clinical protoco l, timely reporting of 
adverse events, assuring that consent is obtained and documente d, reporting of 
unexpected outcomes, and reporting the status of the trial in the annual report 
submitted to the IRB and to the Safety Monitoring Committee per  the SKCCC Data 
and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 External Monitoring Plan 
This is a DSMP Level I study under the SKCCC Data Safety Monito ring Plan 
(9/22/2011). The Clinical Resear ch Office QA Group will perform  an audit after the 
first subject has been treated a nd then periodically depending on the rate of accrual 
and prior audit results. All trial monitoring and reporting wil l be reviewed by the 
SKCCC Safety Monitoring Committee in accordance with the Data a nd Safety 
Monitoring Plan and IRB policies.  
 
6.0  Statistical Considerations 
This is a study of maintenance rituximab with mTor inhibition ( everolimus) after 
high-dose consolidative therapy in CD20+, B-cell Lymphomas and Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma.    It is hypothesized t hat the addition of new agents  in patients with 
minimal residual disease will improve event free survival and t hat everolimus may 
act synergistically with rituximab.       
Primary Objective:   
To determine the safety of maintenance rituximab and prolonged mTOR inhibition 
with everolimus in CD20+, B ce ll lymphoma and H odgkin’s Lymphoma after high-
dose consolidative therapy. 
 
Secondary Objectives: 
1. The secondary endpoint of this st udy is to evaluate event-free survival (EFS) at three 
years.  EFS is defined as the inte rval from registration to the  date of first objective 
disease progression, death from a ny cause, or last patient evaluation.  Patients who 
have not progressed or died will be censored at the last date t hey were assessed and 
deemed relapse-free.   
2. To determine whether maintenance rituximab with everolimus trea tment reduces the 
frequency circulating cancer cells. 
3. To determine if relapsed diseas e is sensitive, in-vivo, to mTor  kinase inhibition.

Study Design:   
Treatment will consist of rituximab 375mg/m2 q 90 days (4 infusions) with 
everolimus 2.5 mg orally daily f or one year.  There will be no drug escalation in this 
study however serum drug levels will be monitored and the level  of everolimus will 
be maintained in the therapeut ic window.  For patients outside the range of 3 – 
15ng/mL and not experiencing grad e 3 or higher toxicity, the do se will either be 
increased or decreased by 2.5mg pe r day to bring patients withi n range, down to 2.5 
mg every 4 days. Addendum 4 provides details on dose adjustment s and treatment 
holds.  For patients experiencing grade 3 or higher toxicities adjustments will be 
made as detailed in addendum 4.  T he study will be monitored co ntinuously for 
safety. 
 
Sample size/Accrual Rate:   
The accrual rate for this study is expected to be 20 patients per year.  The safety 
objective of this trial is bas ed on the precision of estimating  grade 3 or higher 
toxicities.  Sixty patients will allow us to estimate the propo rtion of patients 
experiencing grade 3 or higher toxicities with a precision of ±  13%. 
 
Early Stopping Guide line for Safety:   
Because dose will be managed to target a therapeutic window, to xicity evaluation in 
this study will be based on events that would indicate either the therapeutic dose was 
too toxic to maintain or that th is method increased the probabi lity of unexpected 
complications.  These events incl ude any patient for which the minimum 2.5 mg 
everolimus every other day was  not tolerable or any unexpected hospitalizations 
during protocol participation.  W e will monitor the study conti nuously.  If it 
becomes evident that the proporti on of failures convincingly ex ceeds 15%, the study 
will be halted for a safety consultation.  The stopping rule wi ll hold enrollment if the 
posterior probability of failure  being larger than 0.15 is 75% or higher.  The prior for 
this monitoring rule is beta(1, 6 ).  This means that our prior guess at the proportion 
of failures is 14.3%, and there is 90% probability that this pr oportion is between 
0.85% and 39%.

Early Stopping Guideline for Futility and Simulation Sample Siz e:   
This study will be monitored for efficacy as well as toxicity.  If the study meets the 
accrual goal of 20 patients per ye ar, accrual would be complete d by the time the first 
patients enrolled on study reach the three year efficacy endpoint.  We will therefore monitor the study based on one-yea r EFS, knowing that if the one-year EFS is 
convincingly less than our targe ted EFS at three years, the study would not meet its 
efficacy objective and the trial s hould be halted.  Patients th at have not progressed or 
died will be censored at the last date they were assessed and d eemed relapse-free.  
The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimate will be used to estima te the EFS function 
at one year.  After 20 patients have been enrolled, the design will include interim 
analyses for futility that could halt the trial if it seems lik ely that the drug 
combination does not have suffi cient clinical activity.      
  
The sample size of 60 and the s tudy design operating characteristics assume a three-
year recruitment period with a n additional follow-up of one yea r.  Based on a study 
of high dose cyclophosphamide and rituximab without stem cell transplantation at 
our institution [2], the one and t hree-year EFS for low grade B  cell lympohmas was 
67 and 49% respectively.  The simul ation below demonstrates how  the operating 
characteristics of the design varies when the uncertainty of th e one-year EFS is 
characterized with the prior: be ta(3,2).  This implies that our  prior guess at one-year 
EFS for these patients is 60%, and there is 90% probability tha t the EFS at 12 
months is between 25% and 90%.  
 
We have designed this study to st op early only if it appears that this treatment is 
associated with a lower one-yea r EFS than 50%.  Specifically, t he stopping rule will 
hold enrollment if the posterior  probability of one-year EFS be ing less than 50% is 
70% or higher.  Simulations were carried out with exponential s urvival and 
staggered patient entry.  We assumed, on average, 2 patients wo uld enter the study 
per month.  Interim analyses began once 20 patients entered the  study and occurred 
after groups of 10 patients therea fter, up to a maximum of 60 p atients.  The interim 
analysis estimates of one-year EFS are based on analyses with an underlying Dirichlet process prior.  We a pproximated the posterior distribution, which is 
actually a mixture of Beta distributions, the mixture depending  on the amount of 
censoring, with a single Beta dist ribution.  The parameters of this posterior Beta 
distribution are based on the num ber of failures and the effect ive sample size at 12 
months, combined with the parame ters of the prior.  The followi ng tables summarize 
the operating characteristics und er various scenarios for the underlying exponential 
EFS, based on 1000 simulations.  The  95% posterior intervals ar e the quantiles of

interpretation is that the pos terior probability that the estimate of one-year PFS lies

Analysis of primary objective:   
The proportion of patients positive for the toxicity evaluation  as define for this 
study: patients for which the minimum 2.5 mg everolimus every o ther day was not 
tolerable or any unexpected hospi talizations during protocol pa rticipation will be 
reported with an exact binomia l calculation and 95% confidence interval.  The 
proportion of patients requiring dos e adjustments down as well as the proportion 
requiring dose adjustments up will be reported separately with confidence intervals.  
All other grade 1 and 2 toxicitie s will be reported by type and  grade, overall and 
within intervals throughout  the study (0, 60], (60, 90], (90,120], (120, 180], (180, 
365] and (365, 1460].   
 
Analysis of secondary objectives:   Standard life table methods will be used to analyze EFS.  We wi ll report the one and 
three-year EFS with 95% confidence  intervals.  The three-year E FS will be 
compared to the null EFS of 49% w ith a Z-score and a one-sided alpha level of 0.05.

Addendum 1: Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or PgP 
Co-administration with strong i nhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoc onazole, 
itraconazole, ritonavir) or P-gl ycoprotein (PgP) should be avoi ded. 
Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythr omycin, 
fluconazole) or PgP inhibitors should be used with caution.  If  patient requires co-
administration of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP inhibitors, reduce the dose 
of everolimus to half the currently used dose. Additional dose reductions to every 
other day may be required to manage toxicities. If the inhibito r is discontinued the 
everolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to in itiation of the 
moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibito r after a washout period of 2 to 3 days. 
Seville orange, star fruit, grap efruit and their juices affect P450 and PgP activity. 
Concomitant use should be avoided.

Addendum 2: Inducers of CYP3A4 and/or PgP 
 
If patients require co-administra tion of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, consider doubling the 
daily dose of Afinitor (base d on pharmacokinetic data), using i ncrements of 5 mg or 
less. This dose of Afinitor is  predicted to adjust the AUC to t he range observed without 
inducers. However, there are no c linical data with  this dose ad justment in patients 
receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the strong inducer is disc ontinued, consider a 
washout period of at least 3 to 5 days (reasonable time for significant enzyme de-induction), before the Afinitor  dose is returned to the dose us ed prior to initiation of the 
strong CYP3A4 inducer. 
This dose adjustment of everolimus is intended to achieve simil ar AUC to the range 
observed without inducers.  However , there are no clinical data  with this dose 
adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers.  If th e strong inducer is 
discontinued the everolimus dos e should be returned to the dose  used prior to 
initiation of the strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer.

Addendum 4: Dose Modifications f or abnormal serum drug concentrations 
without grade III/IV toxicities, grade >III toxicities (CTCAE v ersion 4.0) except 
for stomatitis and lipid/hyperglycemia toxicities 
 Patient will have regularly scheduled everolimus levels drawn t hroughout the study  
 Everolimus is available i n 2.5mg, 5mg and 10mg strengths  
 The reference range for patient s experiencing a <II common toxi city (CTCAE 
version 4.0) is 3-15ng/mL  
 Anytime a dose is adjusted, repeat everolimus serum trough leve ls will be re-drawn  
14 days (± 3 days) later. As clinically possible, all patients’  other labs will be reset to 
match this new everolimus s erum trough level schedule.  
 Once everolimus is held due to high serum trough levels, everol imus should be held 
for 7 days before restarting at a lower dose level. 
 During a treatment hold, everolimu s levels will not be drawn once the serum trough 
level is less than 1.0. 
 There is no limit on how long a patient can be on everolimus treatment hold.  Labs 
will be monitored every two weeks while the patient is on hold.  
 For patients >15ng/mL or <3.0ng/ mL and not experiencing >II gra de common 
toxicity, their dose will be adju sted by +/-2.5mg/day; lowest d ose allowed is 2.5mg 
every 4 days.  The study nurse wil l provide a calendar to patie nts when the dose 
level is 2.5 mg taken every 3 or 4 days 
 If a patient on a schedule of 2.5 mg  (QOD) or lower misses a dose, that dose should 
be made up. 
 Non-hematologic grade > III CTCAE toxicities: hold drug until C TCAE toxicity is  
(I) but can be continued at grade  2 if the baseline values were  within the range of 
grade 2 and restart at a dose le vel -2.5mg/day.  Lowest dose al lowed is 2.5mg every 
4 days 
 Grade 4 or 4 clinical fai lure – discontinue RAD001 
 Recurrence of grade 4 toxicit y after dose reduction – discontinue RAD001 
 Hematologic grade >III CTCAE toxicity 
o Anemia  
 Hgb <8.0g/dL: transfuse RBC;  hold drug for 7 days or until Hgb 
>10mg/dL (untransfused): whiche ver is longer. Restart at a dose -
2.5mg/day. Lowest dose allowed is 2.5mg every 4 days 
o Thrombocytopenia 
 Platelets < 50,000:  hold drug until platelet count is >75,000 and 
restart at a dose level -2.5mg /day. Lowest dose allowed is 2.5m g

Addendum 5: Management of stomati tis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcer s 
Management of stomatitis / oral mucositis / mouth ulcers 
Adverse Drug 
Reaction Severity Afinitor Dose Adjustment and Management Recommendations 
Stomatitis Grade 1 
(Minimal 
symptoms, 
normal diet) No dose adjustment required.  
Manage with non-alcoholic or salt water 
(0.9%) mouth wash severaltimes a day. 
 G rade 2 
(Symptomatic 
but can eat 
and swallow modified diet) Temporary dose interruption until recovery to grade ≤1.  
Re-initiate Afinitor at the same dose. 
If stomatitis recurs at grade 2, interrupt dose 
until recovery to grade ≤1. Re-initiate 
Afinitor at a lower dose. 
Manage with topical analgesic mouth 
treatments (e.g. benzocaine,butyl 
aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrocholoride, 
menthol or phenol)with or without topical corticosteroids (i.e. triamcinolone oral 
paste)*. 
 G rade 3 
(Symptomatic 
and unable to 
adequately eat 
or hydrate 
orally) Temporary dose interruption until recovery to grade ≤1.  
Re-initiate Afinitor at lower dose. 
Manage with topical analgesic mouth 
treatments (i.e. benzocaine,butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrocholoride, menthol or phenol) with or without topical 
corticosteroids (i.e. triamcinolone oral paste)* 
 G rade 4 
(Symptoms 
associated with life-threatening 
consequences) Discontinue Afinitor and treat with appropriate medical therapy. 
* using agents containing alcohol , hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and  thyme derivatives in 
management of stomatitis as they may worsen mouth ulcers . 
 
Patients with a clinical history of stomatitis/mucositis/mouth ulcers and those with 
gastrointestinal morbidity associated with mouth/dental infecti ons, irritation of 
esophageal mucosa e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) a nd pre-existing 
stomatitis/mucositis must be monitored even more closely. Patie nts should be

instructed to report the first onset of buccal mucosa irritation/reddening to their 
study physician immediately. 
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to Everolimus should  be treated using local 
supportive care. Please note that investigators in earlier tria ls have described the 
oral toxicities associated with Everolimus as mouth ulcers, rat her than mucositis or 
stomatitis. If your examination reveals mouth ulcers rather tha n a more general 
inflammation of the mouth, please classify the adverse event as such. The suggested paradigm for treatment of stomatitis/oral mucositis/m outh ulcers is as 
follows: 
 
1. For mild toxicity (Grade 1), use conservative measures such as non-alcoholic mouth 
wash or salt water (0.9%) mout h wash several times a day until resolution. 
2. For more severe toxicity (Grad e 2 in which case patients have p ain but are able to 
maintain adequate oral alimenta tion, or Grade 3 in which case patients cannot 
maintain adequate oral alimenta tion), the suggested treatments are topical analgesic 
mouth treatments (i.e., local ane sthetics such as benzocaine, b utyl aminobenzoate, 
tetracaine hydrochloride, men thol, or phenol) with or without t opical corticosteroids, 
such as triamcinolone oral pa ste 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase
®). 
3. Agents containing hydrogen peroxi de, iodine, and thyme derivati ves may tend to 
worsen mouth ulcers. It is pref erable to avoid these agents. 
4. Antifungal agents must be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. In 
particular, systemic imidazole a ntifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, 
itraconazole, etc.) should be avoi ded in all patients due to th eir strong inhibition of 
everolimus metabolism, thereby leading to higher everolimus exp osures. Therefore, 
topical antifungal agents are pr eferred if an infection is diag nosed. Similarly, 
antiviral agents such as acycl ovir should be avoided unless a v iral infection is 
diagnosed.

Addendum 6: Management of hyper lipidemia and hyperglycemia  
Treatment of hyperlipidemia should take into account the pre-treatment status and 
dietary habits. Blood tests to monitor hyperlipidemia must be t aken in the fasting 
state. Hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia should be treate d according to local 
best clinical practice. Patient s should be monitored clinically  and through serum 
chemistry for the development of  rhabdomyolysis and other adverse events as 
required in the product label/data sheets for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. 
Management of hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia 
Adverse Drug Reaction Severity Afinitor Dose Adjustment and 
Management Recommendations 
Metabolic events 
(e.g. 
hyperglycemia, 
dyslipidemia) Grade 1 No dose adjustment required. 
Initiate appropriate medical therapy and 
monitor. 
 Grade 2 No dose adjustment required. 
Manage with appropriate medical therapy and monitor. 
 Grade 3 Temporary dose interruption. 
Re-initiate Afinitor at lower dose. 
Manage with appropriate medical therapy 
and monitor. 
 Grade 4 Discontinue Afinitor and treat with 
appropriate medical therapy. 
 
Dyslipidemia (including hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglycer idemia) has been 
reported in patients taking everolimus.  Monitoring of blood ch olesterol and 
triglycerides prior to the start  of everolimus therapy and peri odically thereafter as 
well as management with appropriate medical therapy is recommen ded. 
Hyperglycemia has been reporte d in patients taking everolimus. Monitoring of 
fasting serum glucose is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and 
periodically thereafter. More frequent monitoring is recommende d when 
everolimus is co-administered with other drugs that may induce hyperglycemia.  
Optimal glycemic control should be  achieved before starting tri al therapy.

Addendum 7: Management of non -infectious pneumonitis 
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin deriv atives. Cases of 
non-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease ) have also been 
described in patients taking evero limus.  Some of these have be en severe and on 
rare occasions, a fatal outcome was observed.  
A diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients 
presenting with non-specific resp iratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, 
pleural effusion, cough or dyspnoea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other 
non-medicinal causes have been excluded by means of appropriate  investigations.  
Opportunistic infections such a s PJP should be r uled out in the  differential 
diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms.  
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non-inf ectious 
pneumonitis and have few or no symptoms may continue Afinitor t herapy without 
dose alteration. If symptoms are moderate (grade 2), consideration should be given to interruption 
of therapy until symptoms improve .  The use of corticosteroids may be indicated.  
Afinitor may be reintroduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the 
dose previously administered. For cases of grade 3 non-infectious pneumonitis, interrupt Afin itor until resolution 
to less than or equal to grade 1.  Afinitor may be re-initiated at a daily dose 
approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered d epending on the 
individual clinical circumstances .   I f  t o x i c i t y  r e c u r s  a t  g r a d e  3, consider 
discontinuation of Afinitor.  For  cases of grade 4 non-infectio us pneumonitis, 
Afinitor therapy should be disc ontinued.  Corticosteroids may b e indicated until 
clinical symptoms resolve. 
For patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment o f non-infectious 
pneumonititis, prophylaxis for pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia  ( P J P )  m a y  b e  
considered. The two compounds studied most extensively for prop hylaxis against 
PJP have been trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, given orally, and pentamidine, 
given as an aerosol.  
If non-infectious pneumonitis develops, the guidelines in the t able below 
should be followed.  Consultation with a pulmonologist is recommended for 
any case of pneumonitis that develops during the study.

Protocol Date: April 1, 2014  1.0 Background  
 
Breast reconstruction with tissue expander (TE) remains widely performed  
technique of breast restoration after maste ctomy .1 During  first stage of reconstruction  
breast TE is placed at  mastectomy site. Most commonly  TE is plac ed into surgically 
created pocket below the pector alis major and serratus muscles  in the mastectomy wound  
(Figure 1).  Alternatively, TE can be plac ed into subpectoral muscular  pocket created with 
additional placement of acellular dermal matrix (ADM)  sling (Figure 2) . Regardless of 
surgical method of placement, TE  is expanded gradually postoperatively over a period of 
several weeks until the desired s ize is ac hieved.  Both techniques demonstrate comparable 
postoperative results including similar postoperative  surgical site and tissue expander 
infection rates. 2 
The incidence of postoperative wound infection  including TE infection  after 
breast reconstruc tion ranges between 5 -20% 2,3,4,6  Recently, several studies demonstrated 
that intra -operative irrigation of surgical pocket  with antibiotic s containing solution 
before insertion of breast TE  resulted in a decrease of postoperative infection rate .5,8,9 
Irrigation of surgical wound with triple antibiotic solution (1 g of cefazolin, 50,000 U of 
bacitracin, and 80 mg of gentamicin in 500 mL of NS) was found to decrease  bacterial 
growth associated with periprosthetic infections in both breast augmentation and 
reconstru ctive patients 5,10. The Department of Plastic Surgery at Vanderbilt University 
routinely irrigates surgically  created muscular pocket with triple antibiotics solution  
before placement breast TE. This decrease d the  postoperative  infection rate  within our 
department to 14%. Despite improvement in incidence of postoperative infection  after 
applicatio n of t riple antibiotic solution, some authors suggested  that this technique has 
several  drawbacks . For example,  most antimicrobials agents are effective against 
microorganisms when d rug exposure occurs during bacteria’s  logar ithmic growth phase. 
Therefore, brief  irrigation  of surgical pocket  with antibiotics does not provide  sufficient 
contact time with bacteria in order to efficiently kill pathogenic micr oorganism s. 
In order to further enhance antisepsis inside surgical pocket before placing breast 
TE we purpose  to use 0.05% chlorhexidine (CHG) instead  of triple antibiotic solution. 
Several recent studies demonstrated exceptional antiseptic properties of CHG deriva tives. 
8, 9,12 -14 CHG is widely used for preparation of the surgical field and preoperative hand

solutions. More recently several reports demonstrated that irr igation o f chronically 
infected surgical wounds with 0.05% CHG  decreases bacterial contamination without 
inhibiting wound healing  or toxic side effects8. Exposure to a concentration of 0.05% 
CHG effectively produced a 5 - to 6-log reduction in m icrobial rec overy. E ffective 
bacterial reduction was observed  with both gram -positive and gram -negative surgical 
isolates . Specifically, antibacterial effect of CHG was prominent towards b iofilm-
forming strain s associated with infection of  prosthetic device s such as T E.8 
We hy pothesize that intraoperative irrigatio n of surgical pocket with 0.05% CHG 
solution before insertion  of breast TE allows for more significant reduction of 
postoperative wound infection compared to similar irrigation with triple antibiotic 
solution  in women  undergoing bilateral  TE-based breast reconstruction.  
We intend  to perform a prospective randomized  study and compare the incidence 
of surgical wound infection between mastectomy  wounds irrigated with triple antibiotic 
solution (one side) and 0.0 5% CHG  (opposite side ) in patients undergoing bilateral breast 
reconstruction.  
1.0  Rationale and Specific Ai ms 
 
 Specific aim:  to evaluate efficacy of 0.05 % CHG  solution to reduce 
postoperative surgical site infections compared to triple antibiotic soluti on in wom en 
undergoing breast reconstruction with TE.  
 
2.0 Animal Studies and Previous Human Studies  
 
Antimicrob ial effects of 0.05% CHG were studied  both in vitro , in vivo  and on 
human subject s previously  8-14. However, efficacy of this solution in d ecreasin g inciden ce 
of surgical  infection after breast reconstruction with TE has never been evaluated.  
 
3.0 Inclusion/E xclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion criteria:  18-81 years old females undergoing bilateral mastectomy who 
are candidates for immediate breast reconstructi on with T E (either total muscle coverage 
or ADM -based techniques) . 
Kye Higdon , MD Depa rtment of Plastic Surgery  
Protocol Version  #1  5 
Protocol Date: April 1, 2014  Exclusion criteria: patients undergoing un ilateral breast reconstruction, 
reconstruction with autologous tissue, bilateral reconstruction with other reconstructive 
techniques (autodermal fl aps, etc) performed on either breast, patients allergic to one or 
more components of the antibiotic solution,  patient allergic to CHG . 
 
4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
Study population  
The study is intended to be prospective randomized clinical trial.  
Randomiz ation   
Site of application of CHG  solution (either left or right surgical wound) in each 
patient will be ran domly assigned by coin flipper application at random.org website 
(http://www.random.org/coins/). Triple antibiotic solution will be used on contral ateral 
side and used as a control . Randomization will occur on the day of the operation. 
 Randomization of su bjects will not be performed. Each patient will serve as self-
control (contralateral surgical wound where triple antibiotic wil l be applied will be  
control side). 
Blinding /Data Collection  
Side of  CHG  application will be recorded by operating surgeon in pat ients 
database secured from other medical professionals participating in the study.  
Examination of reconstructed breasts will be performed by exper ienced cl inic 
nursing staff. The site of application of the CHG solution will not be disclosed during 
clinic visit to nursing staff. The collection of data will be provided  by Marci a Spear, 
DNP, ACNP -BC without knowledge of the side of CHG application.  
 Clinical data associated with the patient will be extracted form StarPanel and 
entered in a RedCap database. Co llected data will include: type of infection (major or 
minor), side of occurrence, route of antibiotic administration (iv or PO), length of 
hospita lization,  any surgical treatment of infected area  (incision and drainage, 
debridement, TE removal), the need for long term iv antibiotic therapy, pathogen based 
on culture results, days till recovery, type and time of repeat reconstruction.  
 
5.0 Study Procedu res 
 
Kye Higdon , MD Depa rtment of Plastic Surgery  
Protocol Version  #1  6 
Protocol Date: April 1, 2014  Brea st reconstruction in each participating patient will be performed without 
deviation from standard technique  routinely performed at Department of Plastic Surgery 
at Vanderbilt University . Upon completion of  mastectomy , surgical pocket will be 
creat ed either  with pectoral and serratus muscle s or with pectoral muscle and ADM. 
Before insertion of breast TE, randomly selected surgical pocket  (either left or right) will 
be irrigated with 500ml of 0.05% CHG solution for 1 minute. After 1 minute CHG 
soluti on will b e aspirated and TE inserted into surgical pocket following by muscle and 
skin closure. Accordingly, contralateral site will be irrigated with triple antibiotic solution 
for 1 minute, aspirated and breast TE will be inserted and wound closed in ide ntical 
fashion.  
 
 Drugs  that will be used : 
-triple antibiotic solution: 1 g of cefazolin, 50,000 U of bacitr acin, and 80 mg of 
gentamicin in 500 mL of NS. If the patient is allergic to either component – the allergen 
will not be used in the solution.  
- 0.05% chlo rhexidine solution –by diluting 6.25 ml of 4% chlorhexidine in 500ml of NS 
solution (1:80) .   
  
Outc ome measures  
Primary outcome : 
- frequency of surgical site infection (as defined by CDC,  
http:/ /www.cdc. gov/hai/ssi/ssi.html ) 
Surgical site infection will be subdivided into “minor” infection —defined by 
clinical signs of infection successfully treated with outpatient antibiotic therapy —or 
“major” infection requiring inpatient hospitalization for in travenous  antibiotic treatment 
and/or any surgical treatment.   
 
- frequency of TE infection (any infection of  surgical site requiring surgical revision of 
TE) 
 
6.0 Risks  
Kye Higdon , MD Depa rtment of Plastic Surgery  
Protocol Version  #1  7 
Protocol Date: April 1, 2014  We anticipate low risk s given the  previously demonstrated safety of CHG . 
Furthermore, minimal syste mic absorption  of CHG is expected  since it will be used 
topically as irrigation. Allergic reaction t o this drug including severe skin rash, swelling, 
trouble breathing and possibly death is rare.  
 
7.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Probl ems invol ving Risk 
to Participants or Others  
 
The progress of the study will be discussed formerly at regular ly scheduled 
research meetings. These will serve as a forum for the voicing of concerns or problems 
with the study. If participant safety is a conc ern, the research investigators will 
immediately notify the P.I.   Adverse events will be reported to the IRB according to IRB 
policies and procedures, as there are specific guidelines at IRB Policy and Procedure 
III.L.1 that must be followed.  
  
8.0 Study With drawal/Di scontinuation  
 
Patient can be taken out of the study if patient is allergic to CHG and if the study 
is closed.  
 
9.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Sample size  
The frequency of surgical site infection in patients undergoing breast 
reconstruction is 14 %.We antici pate a 4 -fold reduction on infection rate with 0.05% 
CHG down to approximately 3.5%. Using binary su periority the estimated sample size is 
110 breasts per group ( 110 patients) with significance b -alpha 5% and the power of 80% 
(1- beta ).  http://ww w.sealede nvelope.com/power/binary -superiority  
 Statistical analysis  
 Categorical variables are compared usin g a chi -square test, and the Student t -test 
is used to compare continuous variables between groups. Logistic regression with 
adjustment for  other p ossible r isk factors  is used to estimate the odds ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals.

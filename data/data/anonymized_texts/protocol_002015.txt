NASH (EMMINENCE™) 
Study Number  MSDC -0602K -C009NASH  
Study Phase  Phase 2  
Study Design  This is a randomized, double -blinded study of three doses of MSDC -
0602K (62.5, 125 and 250 mg) or placebo given orally once daily to subjects with biopsy proven NASH with fibrosis and no cirrhosis.   Subjects will be stratified by presence of T2DM (Yes/No), 
use of Vi tamin E ≥ 400 IU (Yes/No) and fibrosis score (F1 or ≥ F2) 
to ensure equal representation across all groups .  The primary 
efficacy endpoint will be assessed at 12 months. Visits to the clinic will be at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, with one 2- week 
follow -up visit. 
Subject Population  Subjects with biopsy proven NASH (NAS ≥ 4; at least one point in each category) with F1 to F3 fibrosis score.  Subjects with demonstrated cirrhosis, or evidence of other chronic liver diseases to include active hepatitis, excess alcohol consumption, docume nted 
hemochromatosis or other metabolic liver diseases, or autoimmune hepatitis will be excluded from the trial.  Females should be postmenopausal or surgically sterilized.  Subjects must have signed an informed consent. 
Planned Number of Subjects  Approxi mately 380 subjects will be randomized with the intent to 
have 340 subjects complete the 12- month assessment (4 groups; 
approximately 85 subjects/group) at approximately 50 to 75 sites in the US.  Sites in other regions may be added.  Subjects who do not complete the study will not be replaced.

will be 62.5, 125, and 250 mg.  Each subject will self -administer one 
capsule per day.  
Duration of Treatmen t This study will be comprised of a maximum 42- day Screening 
period, a treatment period of 360 days and a 14 -day follow -up 
period.  The total duration of the study for each subject will be up to 416 days, including follow -up. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables  Blood samples for trough PK analysis of MSDC -0602 and 
MSDC -0597 (the hydroxymetabolite) will be taken at Study Visits 
2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (Days 30, 90, 180, 270 and 360).  
Efficacy Variables  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Hepatic histological improvement in NAS defined as a decrease of at least 2 points with no worsening of fibrosis stage at 12 months.  The reduction in NAS must include at least a 1 point reduction in either ballooning or inflammation.  No worsening of fibr osis is 
defined as no increase in CRN fibrosis score.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  1. Proportion of subjects with resolution of NASH with no worsening of fibrosis at 12 months.  Resolution of NASH is defined as a ballooning score of 0 and an inflammation score of 0-1.  No worsening of fibrosis is defined as no increase in 
CRN fibrosis score .  
2. Proportion of subjects with improvement of fibrosis (CRN staging score) by at least 1 stage with no worsening of NASH at 12 months. 
3. Mean change from baseline in NAFLD activity score (NAS) and each one of its components (steatosis, inflammation and ballo oning) at 12 months.

Safety Assessments Safety will be assessed by periodic measurement of vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examinations and the 
occurrence of adverse events (AEs).  Fasting blood samples for central lab analyses of clinical chemistries and hematology will be 
collected at each study visit (Screening and Study Visits 1- 8).  
Samples for urinalysis will be collected at Screening and all Study Visits except Visits 2 and 3.  
Statistical Plan and Methods  Sample Size  
Each o f the three MSDC -0602K dose groups will be compared to 
the placebo group at the two- sided 0.05 significance level; 85 
subjects per arm provides approximately 80% power to detect a difference in response rates of 39.5% in any MSDC -0602K dose 
group versus 20% response rate in the placebo group. Assuming 10% of subjects will not complete the 12- month assessment due to 
early discontinuation, approximately 380 subjects will be randomized to the study.  The randomization ratio is 1:1:1:1.  
Plan for statistical an alysis  
The modified Intent -to-Treat analysis set (mITT, see Section 11.2 
for details), including treated subjects in the treatment group to which randomized, will  be used in the analysis of the primary 
endpoint.  The other key efficacy response related endpoints will also use mITT for the main analysis. 
A responder with respect to the primary endpoint will be defined as having a 2 point reduction in NAS (NASH CRN scoring) with no concurrent worsening of fibrosis defined as progression of at least one stage (using the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) fibrosis staging system).  The reduction in NAS must include at least 
a 1 point reduction in either ballooning or inflammation. Comparisons between each active treatment group and the placebo group with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint will be evalu ated using appropriate contrasts from a logistic regression 
model that includes adjustments for randomization stratification factors and baseline NAS. Model -adjusted odds ratios and their 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) will be provided. In addition, the str atum -

Confidential  Page 11 of 68  adjusted response rate differences between each dose group and the 
placebo group and their associated 95% CIs will be provided. An exploratory evaluation of the homogeneity of comparisons across the randomization stratification factors will be provide d. 
The secondary response -related, binary efficacy endpoints will also 
be analyzed using logistic regression adjusting for the randomization stratification factors. Model- adjusted odds ratios and their associated 
95% confidence intervals will be provided.  The mean change from baseline secondary endpoints will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) models adjusted for the stratification factors and the baseline score.  
An interim analysis of exploratory and safety endpoints is planned after all subjects have been randomized into the study and 6- month 
data are available on a minimum of 300 randomized subjects.

2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY   
 Background 
MSDC -0602K is a novel insulin sensitizer that interacts with a newly identified mitochondrial 
target (mTOT, m itochondrial T arget  Of the T hiazolidinediones), while sparing direct activation 
of the PPARγ  receptor believed to be associated with side effects of volume expansion and weight 
gain related to the first generation of insulin sensitizers which were marketed as PPARγ agonists  
(1-3).  As an mTOT modulating insulin sensitizer, MSDC-0602K has a favorable 
pharmacological profile to treat fatty liver disease including non- alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH).  The effects of MSDC -0602K have been evaluated in two animal models of fatty liver 
disease.  In the first model, C57B1/6 J mice were fed a diet providing 60% of its calories as fat for 
10 weeks (C57 DIO mice) and then administered a high fat diet containing either no drug or MSDC -0602K 30 mg/kg for 2 to 4 weeks.  Treatment of these mice resulted in a number of 
positive effects associated with the insulin -sensitizing pharmacology, including a complete 
clearance of fat from the liver once the high fat diet was removed.  Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, MSDC-0602K treatment reduced the activation of mTOR in the liver and resulted in changes that favored lipid oxidation over lipid storage (
4).  Since the C57 DIO mouse 
model does not develop liver lesions that are representative of NASH, similar studies were repeated in C57 mice fed a diet containing a high content of trans fat (40% of calories, mainly trans -oleic and trans -linoleic acids) together with cholesterol (2%) and fructose (22%).  This diet 
produces scarring of the liver and a liver pathology with ballooning that is characteristic of 
NASH.  Treatment of these mice with MSDC -0602K after 4 weeks of this diet through 16 weeks 
of age produced a significant reduction in the portal tract pathology even though the mice were retained on the diet throughout the 16 week period.  These data suggest that MSDC-0602K should be effective in the treatment of NASH.

 Summary of Preclinical Safety of MSDC -0602 
 Safety Pharmacology  
MSDC -0602 did not induce adverse neurofunctional ( 5) or pulmonary effects ( 6) in rats at doses 
up to the limit dose of 2000 mg/kg/day.  In vitro , MSDC -0602 inhibited the hERG- mediated 
potassium current with an IC 20 (unbound drug concentration) of 20.2 μM (7490 ng/mL). 
However, the hydroxymetabolite MSDC-0597 inhibited the hERG-mediated potassium current by 
only 7.62% at 33 µ M (12,300 ng/mL), the highest concentration that could be tested based on 
solubility  (7).  Given the high degree of binding of MSDC-0602 and MSDC-0597 to plasma 
proteins in humans (>98%)  (8), free concentrations associated with hERG inhibition in vitro  are 
unlikely to be achieved in vivo.  In the cardiovascular safety study in monkeys given up to the 
limit dose of 1000 mg/kg/day, no effects on heart rate, blood pressure, or ECG parameters 
including QT interval were noted ( 9). 
 Toxicology  
The nonclinical safety profile of non- micronized MSDC -0602 was evaluated in rats and monkeys 
given once daily oral doses for up to 28 days ( 10,11 ).  Pharmacokinetic studies of the micronized 
MSDC-0602 in the vehicle used in toxicology studies indicated that systemic exposures to both 
MSDC -0602 and MSDC-0597 were approximately 2.5-fold higher in rats and approximately 
6-fold higher in monkeys than after administration of non- micronized compound. Consequently, 
the nonclinical safety profile of micronized MSDC-0602 was also evaluated in mice, rats and monkeys given once daily oral doses for up to 15 days.  Subsequent pharmacokinetics studies demonstrated that even higher systemic exposure to both MS DC-0602 and MSDC-0597 was 
achieved following administration of MSDC-0602K (
12,13 ).  Since MSDC -0602K was selected 
for continued development, the nonclinical safety profile of MSDC-0602K was also evaluated in mice, rats and monkeys in repeated dose studies up to 52 weeks.  
In 13-week studies, there were no MSDC-0602K-related deaths in mice given up to 2000 mg/kg/day ( 14) or in monkeys given up to 1000 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks  (15
).  In the 
13-week study in rats, 2 females given 2000 mg/kg/day had drug- related deaths; the highest  
nonlethal dose was 300 mg/kg/day ( 16).  Decreases in red cell mass, and increases in liver and 
heart weight were observed in all 3  species; these effects were reversible.  In rodents, the organ 
weight increases were ac companied by hepatocellular and cardiac myofiber hypertrophy.  
Increased adipocytes were seen in bone marrow in all 3  species, but hematopoietic cells were 
unaffected.  Macrovesiculation of brown adipose tissue was noted in monkeys.  There was biochemical and ultrastructural evidence of peroxisome proliferation in rats but not in monkeys.  The NOAEL in the primary toxicology species, rats and monkeys, were 30 and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively.  The mean combined -sex steady -state AUC
0-24 of pharmacologically a ctive species 
(MSDC -0602 + MSDC-0597) at the NOAEL was 1,040,000 ng·hr/mL in rats and 
549,000 ng·hr/mL in monkeys. 
The chronic toxicity of MSDC-0602K was evaluated in rats given up to 60 mg/kg/day for 26 weeks  (17
) and  in monkeys given up to 300 mg/kg/day for up to 52 weeks, including a 
26-week interim sacrifice group  (18).  There were no MSDC-0602K- related deaths in rats treated 
for 26 weeks or in monkeys treated for up to 52 week s.  Body weight and food consumption were 
increased in rats but not in monkeys.  Decreases in red cell mass were noted in both species.

Confidential  Page 21 of 68  Heart weights were increased in rats but there were no accompanying histopathologic or histomorphometric changes.  No e ffects on heart weight or histopathology or histomorphometry 
of the heart were observed in monkeys.  Echocardiographic examinations did not identify any drug- related changes in heart chamber size, systolic performance, or hemodynamics in monkeys 
after 26 o r 52 weeks.  Liver weights were increased in monkeys but there were no associated 
histopathologic changes.  Increased adipocytes in bone marrow were seen in rats and monkeys but hematopoietic cells were unaffected in all but a few rats.  Macrovesiculation of intrascapular 
brown adipose tissue was observed in monkeys at ≥30 mg/kg/day.  Urothelial vacuolation in 
urinary bladder and/or renal pelvis was observed in monkeys at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day.  None of these 
changes were considered adverse.  Therefore, the NOAEL w as 60  mg/kg/day in rats and 
300 mg/kg/day in monkeys.  The mean combined -sex steady -state AUC
0-24 of pharmacologically 
active species (MSDC -0602 + MSDC -0597) at the NOAEL was 1,380,000  ng·hr/mL in rats and 
901,000 ng·hr/mL in monkeys. 
As described above, s ome findings typically observed with other insulin- sensitizing agents were 
observed in mice, rats, and monkeys given high doses of MSDC -0602 or MSDC -0602K in sub-
chronic  studies.  However, in chronic studies with MSDC -0602K, findings similar to those of 
other insulin- sensitizing agents that were noted were not considered adverse based on the low 
magnitude of the changes and lack of adverse physiologic consequences.  Importantly, key effects 
such as edema, fluid volume expansion, body weight (in monkeys), pe ricardial/thoracic fluid 
accumulation, heart weight increase (in monkeys), fatty change in liver, adipose tissue 
proliferation, and effects in ovary and lymphoid tissue reported with other insulin- sensitizing 
agents were not observed in chronic studies in rats or monkeys at exposures 7 to 11 times those in humans given 250 mg doses of MSDC -0602K (free acid equivalents).  The diminished effects of 
MSDC -0602 and MSDC -0602K in toxicology studies completed to date may reflect a reduced 
ability to directly activate the nuclear transcription factor PPARγ, particularly at the lower dose levels evaluated, compared to typical PPARγ agonists.  This supposition is supported by recent evidence indicating that PPARγ activation is not necessary for insulin sensitizat ion, but it is 
responsible for dose -limiting side effects of pioglitazone, including increased plasma volume  (19
, 
20). 
MSDC -0602 was not mutagenic in bacteria, was not clastogenic in hum an peripheral blood 
lymphocytes in  vitro , and was not genotoxic in bone marrow of mice.  The hydroxymetabolite 
MSDC -0597 was a lso not mutagenic in bacteria.  
Two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats with MSDC -0602K have been completed ( 21, 
22), and neoplastic findings were limited to an increased incidence of hemangiosarcoma in male 
mice at 100  mg/kg/day (only when compared to the upper range of historical control incidence) 
and a n increased, albeit low incidence of transitional cell carcinoma in the urinary bladder in male 
rats at ≥ 10 mg/kg/day.  Published mechanistic studies with other compounds inducing similar 
tumors suggest that such tumors are not indicative of human risk ( 23-26).

 Clinical Summary and Dose Selection  
 Early Clinical Data for MSDC -0602  
Three Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers have been completed ( 27-29).  Study MSDC-
0602-C001 evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of non-micronized and micronized unformulated bulk drug given as powder in capsule (PIC).  Study MSDC -0602-C003 was a pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability study of 100 mg and 
250 mg tablets made with micronized bulk drug that were administered at doses of 100 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg (2 x 250 mg tablets) in hard gelatin capsules.  The bioavaila bility was 
determined relative to micronized MSDC -0602 bulk drug powder in a gelatin capsule similar to 
what was dosed in Study MSDC-0602-C001.  Study MSDC-0602K-C004 was a pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability study of 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg (2 x 250 mg tablets) (free acid equivalents) of MSDC -0602K tablets in hard gelatin capsules.  The 
bioavailability was determined relative to micronized MSDC -0602 free acid tablets (250 mg) in a 
gelatin capsule similar to what was dosed in Study MSDC-0602- C002. 
Two Phase 2 clinical  studies in subjects with type 2  diabetes mellitus have been conducted  (30, 
31).  MSDC -0602-C002, a completed Phase 2a study, was conducted to assess the efficacy and 
safety of once daily oral doses of micronized MSDC-0602 free acid compressed tablets at 100, 
250 and 500 mg in subject s with type 2 dia betes.   Daily treatment with MSDC -0602 250 mg and 
MSDC -0602 500 mg for 4 weeks resulted in clinically meaningful median reductions in f asting  
plasma glucose (FPG) from baseline that reached borderline statistical significance relative to placebo and were comparable in magnitude to those observed in a parallel group with pioglitazone 45 mg.  Treatment with MSDC -0602 500 mg resulted in a small, statistically 
significant mean reduction in HbA1c, and in statistically significant reductions in f asting  plasma 
insulin and HOMA-IR when compared with placebo.  Overall male and female mean steady state Cmax of MSDC-0602 and MSDC-0597 for the 100, 250 and 500 mg doses were 2360, 4650 and 7740 ng/mL, respectively, and overall male and female steady state AUC (0-24) of MSDC-0602 
and MSDC-0597 were 34,700, 80,100 and 112,000 ng∙ hr/mL, respectively. 
MSDC -0602 treatment was safe and well tolerated. The incidences of treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) and drug-related TEAEs were similar among the treatment groups. There were no 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and no deaths during this study.  There were no clinically meaningful differences between the MSDC -0602 dose groups and placebo with respect to safety 
laboratory parameters, heart rate, physical examination results, ECG parameters, or edema.  
These data confirm that MSDC -0602 has insulin- sensiti zing pharmacology similar to pioglitazone 
45 mg. The full insulin- sensitizing potential of MSDC -0602 will be further evaluated in larger 
clinical studies of longer duration. 
A pilot, three month mechanistic study is ongoing in type 2 diabetic subject s given once daily 
250 mg doses of MSDC-0602K (MSDC-0602K- C007UT).  Results from three subjects who have 
completed this study to date confirmed the ability of this treatment to increase insulin sensitivity 
in a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp (80 m U/m
2/min Insulin) by 40% and also 
resulted in an average reduction in hemoglobin A1c of 1.4% .  There was also a 50% reduction in 
intramyocellular fat content in skeletal muscle and a similar reduction in hepatic fat.

 Rationale for Dose Selection   
The choice of doses that will be explored in the NASH Phase 2 dose ranging study with MSDC-0602K have been established from an ongoing program connecting AUC to clinical results for MSDC -0602 (free acid, micronized acid, and eventually potassium salt), together with historical 
results using earlier generation compounds including pioglitazone and the prototype mTOT modulating insulin sensitizer, MSDC-0160 (also known as oxopioglitazone and Mitoglitazone ). 
Clinical development in Phase 1 for MSDC-0602 began w ith the free acid as powder -in-capsule 
(PIC).  These studies showed that the target AUCs could not be easily achieved with free acid, but that adequate exposures could be reached with the micronized free acid ( 27-29
).  A tablet 
formulation of the micronized free acid was developed for evaluation  in the first Phase 2a tr ial.  
The Phase 2a trial then confirmed that the targeted AUCs would have anti -diabetic pharmacology 
similar to 45 mg pioglitazone with the reduced PPARγ side effects as predicted from the clinical comparison with the pilot compound, MSDC-0160 (
20).  The micronized free acid of MSDC -
0602 was able to produce pharmacology similar to pioglitazone 45 mg in a 28 day study, again with less effect on body weight and adiponectin (
30). 
The sodium and the potassium salts of MSDC-0602 were considered as possible replacements for the micronized free acid and both were compared in the cynomolgus monkey, which proved to be a good predictor of the kinetics in man.  The potassium (K) salt proved to be most effective ( 13
).  
Therefore, the development program was shifted to the K salt for all long- term precl inical work 
and for subsequent clinical development.  The use of the K salt simplified the production of drug product, allowed much higher exposures in the preclinical models to expand the exploration of safety margins, and allows for lower tablet strengths for drug product.  A cross- over relative 
bioavailability study was conducted in normal volunteers to directly compare the pharmaco - 
kinetics for micronized free acid tablets that were used in the Phase 2a trial to the new form ulation of MSDC-0602K tablet s (
29).  In contrast to the Phase 2a 250 mg micronized free 
acid tablet formulation that produced exposures of 101,000 ng.hr/ml and the 500 mg micronized free acid tablets that produced exposures from 126,000 to 151,000 ng.hr/ml, the 250 mg MSDC-0602K tablet produced an AUC of over 130,000 ng.hr/ml.  These results suggest that 250 mg 
MSDC -0602K should be more than sufficient to produce the maximum insulin sensitizing 
pharmacology based on available data with this compound, as well as the prototype mTOT insulin sensit izer, MSDC -0160.  Importantly, exploring doses up to this exposure allows for a direct 
comparison to pioglitazone (45 mg) , which along with its active metabolites achieves an AUC of 
60,000 ng.hr/ml.  Cusi demonstrated effective resolution of NASH with treatment of 45 mg/day of pioglitazone (
32). 
To confirm that the 250 mg MSDC-0602K dose would produce significant insulin sensitizing pharmacology in man, a small, 3 -month mechanistic study was conducted  in 3 subjects with 
type 2 diabetes.  T his dose was capable of producing a 1.4% reduction in hemoglobin A1c, a 40% 
improvement in insulin sensitivity, and a 50% reduction in intramyocellular lipids  in skeletal 
muscle .  Measurement of hep atic lipid by MRS demonstrated a similar reduction in the one 
subject who has been evaluated for this parameter.  Therefore , the effects of MSDC -0602K are at 
least as large, if not larger, than what has ever been observed with 45 mg pioglitazone in such subjects  (31,33
).

Confidential Page 24 of 68 In summary, the choice of doses that will be explored in the Phase 2 NASH dose-ranging study with MSDC -0602K, 62.5, 125 and 250 mg, have been established from an ongoing program 
connecting AUC to clinical results for MSDC -0602 (free acid, micronized acid, and eventually 
potassium salt) together with historical results using earlier generation compounds including pioglitazone and the prototype mTOT modulating insulin sensitizer, MSDC-0160.  An ongoing, small, 3 -month mechanistic study of MSDC-0602K in 3 subjects with type 2 diabetes confirmed 
that the 250 mg MSDC-0602K dose would produce significant insulin sensitizing pharmacology in man.  The effects of MSDC -0602K are expected to be at least as significant as what was 
observed with 45 mg pioglitazone in such subjects.  Data available from  the trial of  Cusi ( 32
) that 
evaluated the effects of 45 mg pioglitazone in subjects with NASH have been used to power this trial.

6 STUDY DESIGN  
 Summary of Study Design 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study of three oral dose levels of MSDC-
0602K.  Subje cts will be screened for eligibility up to 42 days in advance of randomization 
(between Days -42 and -1).  Subjects will be randomized into 1 of 4 treatment groups based on a 
stratification criteria  of presence Type 2 DM (Yes/No) , use of Vitamin E ≥  400 IU  (Yes/No ), and 
fibrosis score ( F1 or ≥ F2) and will receive single daily doses of MSDC-0602K (62.5, 125 or 
250 mg ), or placebo for one year (360 days).  Approximately 380 subject s will be randomized to 
achieve 85 completed subject s in each of the 4  treatment groups.  The number of subject s who 
have a fibrosis score of F1 will be no greater than 50% of each group in order to best inform the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial.  
• Male or female subjects with NASH and fibrosis should have an interpretable liver biopsy 
within 9 months prior to randomization and  at the end of study treatment at  Visit 7.  
Double-blind study drug will be dispensed for daily administration starting at Study Visit 1.  Subsequent study visits will occur on Days 30 (1 month), 60 (2 months), 90 (3 months), 180 (6 months), 270 (9 months), 360 (12 months) and a 14-day follow-up visit 
on Day 374.  Subject s will self -administer study drug once daily throughout the treatment 
period through the Day 360 visit. Site personnel will contact subjects every month to 
inquire about safety, adverse events and serious adverse events. 
Blood samples will be collected for trough level assay of MSDC-0602 and major me tabolite 
MSDC -0597 concentrations.  Fasting  blood samples will also be collected for analysis of

 Study Activities  
 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be allocated centrally by an IXRS to one of the four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio, according to a central randomization scheme stratified by the presence of T2DM (Yes/No), use of Vitamin E ≥ 400 IU (Yes/No), and fibrosis score (F1 or ≥ F2), each enrolled subject will be sequentially assigned the next available randomization number and be allotted the specified treatment corresponding to that randomization number. 
 Screening Period  (Days -42 to -1) 
Prior to conducting any study-related procedures, written informed consent must be obtained from the subject .  Participation in this study is voluntary.  The nature of the study will be fully 
explained to each s ubject  during the informed consent process and the subject  will have the 
opportunity to ask questions.  An informed consent document will then be signed by the subject  
and the person performing the consent discussion, and retained by the Investigator.  A c opy of the 
informed consent form will be given to the subject . Informed consent may be obtained before the 
42-day screening window. 
 
 
After obtaining a signed informed consent form, study site personnel will access the IXRS to 
assign a subject  identification (ID) number to a potential study subject. This number will be used 
to identify the patient for the remainder of the study. S creening evaluations to determine subject  
eligibility will be conducted within 42 days prior to  randomization ( Day 1 ) in the study.  Subject s 
must fas t for at least 10 hours prior to  the following S creening procedures . 
• Medical history  
• Complete physical examination  
• Vital sign measurements  
• 12-lead ECG  
• Pregnancy test (serum, females only)  
• FSH ( post-menopausal females only)

In the event of an AE that has not resolved by the follow-up visit, additional follow-up visits may be scheduled until the event resolves or is deemed to be a permanently continuing event.  At the Investigator’s discretion, minor AEs may be followed until resolution via a telephone contact.   
 Discontinuation of Study Drug and Study Termination  
Subjects are free to discontinue participation in the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to future medical care; however, prior to randomization, it should be made clear to potential subjects that early withdrawal from the study including loss to follow up can be 
extremely damaging to the scientific research and may pose some risk to the subject.  If a subject 
withdraws consent to be treated with study drug prior to receiving any dose of study drug, the subject should be discontinued from the study.  Once a subject has been randomized, the 
investigator will make every reasonable effort to keep the subject in the study.  
 Subjects may withdraw from study for the following reasons: 
 
• Withdrawal of informed consent:  A subject should be considered to have withdrawn 
consent when the subject no longer wishes to participate in any aspect of the study, and

Confidential Page 38 of 68 does not want any further assessments, visits, or contact.  A subject’s refusal to participate 
in specific aspects of the study, such as a refusal to continue taking study drug or to 
provide blood samples, will NOT constitute withdrawal of consent. Investigators should 
make every effort to facilitate the sub ject’s continued participation in remaining aspects of 
the study.   
• Subject is lost to follow -up:  A subject will not be considered lost to follow-up until just 
prior to database lock and after all efforts to contact the subject have been exhausted.  
 
If a subject withdraws from study for any reason above, vital status as of Day 374 may be 
obtained through pubic registries as permitted by local regulations.  
Subjects who wish to withdraw consent from the study, to the extent possible, will undergo an 
End of Study evaluation equivalent to Visit 8 (Day 374) (see  Table 1).  
The appropriate case report forms (eCRFs) should be completed, including an explanation as to why the subject participation in the study is being discontinued.  Subjects who do not complete 
the study will not be replaced.  
The Investigator and Cirius Therapeutics, Inc. have the right to discontinue study drug dosing 
from any subject in the event of an intercurrent illness, AE, protocol violation, or other reason including, but not limited to:  
• Need for any treatment not allowed by the protocol 
• Subject’s inability to comply with protocol-specified procedures 
• Sites with serious GCP or quality concerns 
• Adverse event that in the opinion of the Investigator requires discontinuation of study 
drugDevelopment of symptoms of CHF that in the opinion of the Investigator requires immediate treatment.  
 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
Refer to subject’s healthcare provider for diabetic care; however, note that no change in dose is allowed for GLP1 agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors during the study and these drugs cannot be added as rescue medications during the study if the subject had not been on a previous stable dose of either drug 3 months prior to randomization.  Use of PPARγ agonists (pioglitazone or rosiglitazone) or insulin are prohibited during the study. 
Subjects being treated with therapeutic agents for diabetes should be on stable dose(s) of the 
following antidiabetic medications at least 3 months prior to randomization and for the full duration of the trial: metformin, GLP1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas and DPP4 inhibitors.   
If, during the study, a measurement of HbA1c exceeds 9.5% at two consecutive visits , the 
following suggested rescue approach may be followed: 
1. Start metformin or uptitrate metformin if the subject is already taking it

Confidential Page 39 of 68 2. Start a DPP4 inhibitor or uptitrate the DPP4 inhibitor if the subject is already taking a DPP4 inhibitor 
3. Start careful titration of a sulfonylurea or titrate sulfonylurea if the subject is already taking it.  
If no reversible cause is identified or hyperglycemia persists despite counseling and all permitted co-therapies, subject  should be discontinued from study drug, referred for treatment, and continue 
in the study and complete the required study visits.
 
If a measurement of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) during the study is lower than 60 mg/dL, an alert will be sent to the investigational site and confirmatory FPG should be performed at the site within 7 days.  In case of a symptomatic hypoglycemic event and if the subject is on a sulfonylurea, the sulfonylurea dose should be reduced by 50% or discontinued.  Severe hypoglycemia is defined as any hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of a third party, hospitalization or associated with seizures or coma.  Refer to Section 9 Adverse Events for reporting instructions. 
 Liver Function Tests  
If subjects demonstrate an increase in AST, ALT or total bilirubin (TB) greater than 2 times their baseline values (mean  of Screening & Visit 1), there should be repeat tests of transaminases (AST 
and ALT), bilirubin, and physical exam performed within 48-72 hours.  If the levels then decrease, the subjects will be under close observation (repeat testing 2-3x weekly) until the levels return toward the individual's baseline values.  Should these levels continue to be elevated, the drug should be discontinued.   
Subjects  should be discontinued for elevations of transaminases (AST or ALT) or TB above 
baseline associated with symptoms of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, 
nausea or vomiting, or eosinophilia.  Subjects  should be discontinued for persistent (> 1 month) 
increases of AST and ALT and/or TB > 2 times baseline. 
Subjects may be rechallenged with study drug and closely monitored with repeat testing at least 
weekly.  Re-elevation of values a fter re -challenge necessitate permanent discontinuation of study 
drug (but continuation of study visits).   
If a new concomitant medication with known hepatotoxicity is started and liver function tests rise 
to meet the above criteria, the known hepatotoxin should be discontinued (replaced) if possible and liver function tests be followed in the same manner as outlined above.  If liver function tests remain elevated or increase further, then the study drug should be discontinued (and subjects should continue with the study. visits). 
 PT/INR Tests  
If subjects demonstrate an increase in PT or INR > 2 times the baseline value (mean  of Screening 
& Visit 1), repeat tests of PT or INR and eosinophil counts should be performed within approximately 48-72 hours.  If the PT or INR elevation is associated with changes in liver biochemistries, the subject should be followed closely per Inves tigator judgement with repeat 
testing at least weekly until levels return toward baseline values.  Subjects should be discontinued

7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS  
 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured at every study visit including Screening and Follow -Up visits .  Vital 
sign measurements will include blood pressure and heart rate, will be taken pre -dose.  
For all subject s, oral temperature (in degrees Celsius ) will be measured at Screeni ng and pre -dose 
on Day 1 (Study Visit 1) and at the Follow -up visit on Day 374 (S tudy Visit 8 ). 
 Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening a nd at the Follow -Up Visit 
(Day  374, Study Visit 8); a limited physical examination will be performed at all othe r study 
visits (Study Visits 1 -7).  Inform ation regarding body weight, waist circumference and assessment 
for the presence of edema will be collected at all study visits and height will be recorded only at Screening.   Subject s are to be weighed in similar attire without shoes on the same scale at each 
visit.  Measure waist circumference as follows:  
Locate the lowest rib and the iliac crest.  Place the tape measure evenly around the bare abdomen at the midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest.  Read the tape measure and record the waist circumference in centimeters.  
The complete physical examination will be comprised of the following general categories of parameters: General Appearance, Dermatological, Head Ears Eyes Nose and Throat (HEENT)/Neck, Pulmonary, Cardiovascular, Gastro- Intestinal, Neurological, Extremities, 
Lymphatic, and Other.   
The limited physical examination will be comprised of at least the following categories of 
parameters: Pulmonary, Cardiovascular, and Extremities.  The presence or absence of edema will be record ed as “yes“ or “no“ at each complete and limited physical examination.  If “yes,“ a grade 
will be recorded for the edema.  Peripheral edema will be assessed as follows:  
Place your index finger over the participant's tibia, 10 cm above the lateral malleolus.  Exert pressure for 5 seconds.  Any depression that does not resume its original contour almost immediately is a sign of pitting edema.  Record if there is no edema observed.  The following scale should be used to grade any edema that is observed.

Confidential Page 41 of 68 Grad e Physical Characteristics  
1+ No visible change in shape of the extremity, pitting ≤ 2 mm, pit 
disappears rapidly 
2+ No marked change in the shape of the extremity, 2 mm < pitting ≤ 5 
mm, pit usually disappears in 10-15 seconds 
3+ Noticeably swollen extremity, 5 mm < pitting ≤ 10 mm, pit may 
persist for about a minute 
4+ Very swollen and distorted extremity, very deep pit > 10 mm, pit 
may persist 2 - 5 minutes 
 Electrocardiograms  
Twelve- lead ECGs will be pe rformed at  Screening, Study Visit 5 (Day 180), Visit 7 (Day 360) 
and Visit 8 (Day 374).  T he ECG obtained at the Screening visit will serve as the baseline 
measurement.  All scheduled ECGs will be performed after the subject  has rested quietly for at 
least 10  minutes in a supine position.  The QT correction derived by the ECG machine or 
computed manually should be recorded.  
To ensure safety of the subject s, a qualified individual at the Investigator site will make 
comparisons with baseline measurements.  If the QTc is >60 msec from the baseline; or an absolute QTc value is >500 msec for any scheduled ECG, the ECG will be repeated 2 more times, approximately 2-4 minutes apart.   
If a machine- read QTc value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be 
necessary if a qualified physician’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the 
acceptable range.  
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as co ntributing to the ECG abnormality such as readings of ischemia, T wave changes, 
or infarct.  
 Laboratory Assessments 
For all subject s, blood samples for safety laboratory assessments will be drawn at every visit 
(Table 1).  All blood samples for clinical chemistry and hematology should be drawn in a f asted 
state (approximately 10 hours).  A certified central clinical laboratory will be used to perform all routine hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis.  Table 2 provides a summary of safety laboratory tests performed during the study. 
All clinical laboratory tests will be performed by the central laboratory specified in Form 
FDA  1572 Section 4.  The central laboratory reference ranges will be used.  Eligibility at 
screening will be based on central laboratory assessments .

 Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
For all subject s, blood samples for pharmacologic ( efficacy  and safety)  assessments will be drawn 
at all visits except Screening ( Table 1).  All blood samples should be drawn in a f asted state 
(approximately 10 hours).  Instructions for collecting, processing, storing and shipping of blood samples for pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic analyses will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
Blood samples for trough PK analy sis of MSDC -0602 and MSDC-0597 will be collected pre-dose 
at Study Visits  2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (Days 30, 90, 180, 270 and 360).   
Blood samples for analysis of FPG and HbA1c will be collected at Screening.  
Blood samples for analysis of insulin, HOMA- IR, FPG , HbA1c, TG, FFA  and f asting  cholesterol 
(total, HDL,  LDL, VLDL ) will be collected as part of the standard chemistry profile at Study 
Visits 1, 5, and 7 (Days 1, 180 and 360).    
Blood samples for analysi s of liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin, PT/INR, ALP, GGT and 
albumin) will be collected at Study Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (Days 1, 30, 60, 90, 180, 270 and 360). 
Blood samples for analysis of HMW adiponectin, hsCRP, osteocalcin , serum C TX concentrations 
will be collected at Study Visits 1, 5, and  7 (Days 1, 180, and 360).  
Blood samples for biomarkers of liver apoptosis ( CK-18 [M30 and M65] ) will be collected at 
Visits 1, 5 and 7 (Days 1, 180, and 360), whereas blood samples for TIMP -1, PIIINP, HA will be 
collected at Visits 1 and 7 (Days 1 and 360). 
Serum samples for NMR analysis of lipoprotein particle size  will be collected at Study Visits 1 
and 7 (Days 1 and 360).  Blood samples will be collected at Visit 1 (Day 1) to be analyzed for genotyping.  Plasma samples for future miRNA measurements  and additional biomarkers of interest will be 
collected at Study Visits 1, 5 and 7 (Days 1, 180 and 360).   Data obtained from the circulating  liver function tests and other biomarkers will be used to 
calculate composite scores that may provide an indirect measure of changes in fibrosis from 
baseline to the 12 month endpoint (Days 1 and 360). 
It is estimated that approximately 226 mL of blood fo r the safety, pharmacokinetic, and 
pharmacodynamic parameters will be drawn from each subject who completes the trial.  
 Transient elastography (FibroScan) measurement of liver fibrosis  
Vibration -Controlled Transient Elastography or FibroScan is a non-invasive methodology that 
assesses liver  fibrosis /steatosis  by measuring liver  stiffness  using ultrasonographic 
elastometry.  The measures are expressed in kilopascals (kPa) and db/m, and values increase with 
greater fibrosis /steatosis. FibroScan will be c onducted at Days 1 and 360 using M or XL probe as 
Cirius Therapeutics, I nc. Clinical Protocol MSDC -0602K-C009NASH, Amendment 4 
MSDC -0602K 31-July-2017
 
  
Confidential Page 44 of 68 needed .  Averages of ten measurements for kPa and CAP scores will be recorded as suggested by 
the manufacturer for the baseline and end  of study measurements. FibroScan values of CAP  ≥ 
270 db/m and kPa ≥  8.5 will be used to qualify subjects for liver biopsy if no historical liver 
biopsy is available.  
 Liver Biopsies  
All subjects will have a liver biopsy at screening/baseline and at Visit 7. Qualifying liver biopsy must be within 9 months prior to Screening . If no usable liver biopsy is available within 9 months 
prior to Screening , a liver biopsy must be performed during Screening after the following criteria 
are confirmed:  
a. AST ≥ 20 U/L  
b. FibroScan with CAP score ≥  270 db/m and kPa ≥  8.5 
The primary clinical diagnosis to enter the study will be performed by a central  clinical 
pathologist.  Slides/paraffin blocks will be shipped to the c entral laboratory where slides will be 
digitized using a Scanscope™ XT (Aperio Technologies, Inc.)  ultra- fast, high- capacity slide 
scanner . Digitized slides will be sent to a single expert histopathologist who is a member of the 
NASH Clini cal Research Network.   The expert pathologist reader will provide individual scores 
for both NAS components and fibrosis scores.  
At the completion of the study, the liver biopsy slides at Visit 7 will be used for diagnosis by the 
local pathologist and then scanned, digitized and sent for blinded reading by the expert histopathologist. 
Before performing a percutaneous liver biopsy, there must be a clearly defined indication for the 
biopsy, and the risks to the subject  should not outweigh the potential benefits.  
The subject’s platelet count and PT (or INR) may be checked  prior to the liver biopsy according 
to local standards.  Local guidelines and thresholds for hemostatic parameters should be used as they are in everyday clinical practice.  Usually a platelet count >  60,000/µL , a PT  > 60% or 
longer by no more than 4 seconds over the control or INR <  1.3, and a normal bleeding time are 
acceptable for performing percutaneous liver biopsy in a subject  that has stopped taking any 
antiagg regant therapy for > 5 days.  If these conditions are not all respected, a safer option would 
be to perform the liver biopsy by trans-jugular route, when available. 
Sedation is recommended to be given for percutaneous liver biopsy, and should be given with 
caution in liver disease.  
The recommended biopsy procedure to be applied is: 
• Needle core biopsy  
• Biopsy obtained with a 16 or lower gauge needle  
• A tissue core ≥  2 cm long (≥  10 portal tracts) represents optimal biopsy length

Confidential Page 45 of 68 • Preferably obtain biopsy from the right lobe.  If left lobe biopsy is used for inclusion, a left lobe biopsy should be used for future biopsies. 
Post-biopsy observation: It is recommended that the subject  should remain in the hospital 
consistent with the standard of care of that institution .  
The biopsies will be sent to the central laboratory and then to a central reader who will read the biopsies to determine the eligibility to the study according to the fibrosis stage and consistency with NASH diagnosis.  Biopsy slides will be blinded for subject  and visit identification prior to 
central reading.  
 Concomitant Medications and Other Therapy  
For diabetic subject s, use of any diabetic medication other than metformin (generic or 
Glucophage®), GLP -1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonyl ureas or DPP4 inhibitors  3 months 
prior to the diagnostic liver biopsy or during the study is prohibited.  Subject s on metformin , 
GLP1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, sulfonylureas or DPP4 inhibitors must have been stabilized on their current dose for a period of 3 months prior to diagnostic liver biopsy and the doses should not be altered during the study except as provided in the rescue medication instructions (Section  6.4).   
Use of other prescription or over -the- counter (OTC) medications or herbal remedies is allowed 
during the study, as long as the subject  has been stabilized on a dose for 6 weeks prior to study 
entry.  Anti aggregants are allowed but should be discontinued for at least 5 days prior to the liver 
biopsy.  Any concomitant medication taken during the study must be recorded in the e CRF.    
Use of ursodeoxycholic acid is prohibited as there is insufficient knowledge of its effects in this subject  population.  
MSDC -0602K is metabolized to its hydroxymetabolite by a carbonyl reductase.  This is a 
ubiquitous enzyme and there is no prior evidence to indicate that any concomitant medications would interfere with this metabolism.   There is minimal interaction of MSDC -0602K or its 
metabolite with CYP P450 systems, either by direct inhibition or induction.  However, there is a potential for inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 particularly with the active metabolite, which is the predominant moiety in circulation.  For these reasons, the following medications are also prohibited in this trial:  paclitaxel, phenytoin, warfarin, celecoxib, tolbutamide and repaglinide. 
 Alcohol, Caffeine and Tobacco 
Use of alcohol should be consis tent with Exclusion Criterion 5  (no substance abuse within the 
past 6 months).  If change in use of alcohol, caffeinated products  or tobacco, as reported by the 
subject (not solicited by site at each visit), results in an adverse event, note this change in event term (e.g., headache from caffeine reduction, jittery from quitting or reducing tobacco use).   
 Physical Activity  
Subject s will abstain from strenuous exercise other than normal activity (e.g., heavy lifting, 
weight training, calisthenics, or aerobics) for 48 hours prior to each blood collection for clinical laboratory tests.  Walking at a normal pace will be permitted .

 Dietary Guidance 
Beginning at Visit 1, subject s who are not diabetics will be counseled to follow the NCEP Step 1 
diet ( Appendix 2 ).  Subject s who are diabetic who have been following a diet consistent with 
ADA recommendations for type 2 diabetics ( Appendix 1 ) should be counseled to continue that 
diet.  
 Meals and Fluid Intake  
Subject s must abstain fro m all food and drink (except water) at least 10 hours prior to any safety 
laboratory evaluations and 10 hours prior to the start of PK sample collections.  
 Contraception  
Only females who are postmenopausal (verified by FSH) or are surgically sterilized (bi lateral 
tubal ligation,  bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy) will be included in the study 
population; those with bilateral tubal ligation must use a barrier method of birth control during the study.  Male subject s must use a condom, plus another form of contraception (e.g., spermicide, 
intrauterine device, birth control pills taken by female partner, diaphragm with spermicide) if engaging in sexual intercourse with a woman who could become pregnant.  Male subject s must 
also be willing to abstain from sexual intercourse or use a condom during sexual intercourse with pregnant or lactating females.  Male subjects must adhere to these contraceptive criteria from administration of study drug through the follow up visit on Day 374. 
 Premature Termination of Study/Closure of Site  
The study may be terminated prematurely if new toxicological findings, or results affecting the safety of the subject s, become available.  The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at 
any time  for any reason. 
A site may be closed based on issues identified with subject recruitment, GCP compliance, poor quality data, evidence of attempted or proven fraud, or for any reason at the sponsor’s discretion. 
In the event the sponsor prematurely terminates a particular study site, the site staff  will promptly 
notify the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

(HDPE) with child resistant caps.  Each bottle will contain medication for 31 days + 2 additional days of treatment .  Three bottles/kit will be assigned and dispensed to  each subject  at each of 
Visits 1, 4, 5 and 6. Medication labels will include storage conditions for the drug and the subject ’s initials.  
 Treatments  
At Visit 1 ( Day 1), all eligible subject s will b e equally randomized to one of the 4 treatment arms 
listed below:  
• MSDC -0602K 62.5 mg capsules  
• MSDC -0602K 125 mg capsules   
• MSDC -0602K 250 mg capsules   
• Matching Placebo #00 capsules  
 Rando mization Code Creation and Storage 
Randomization personnel of the sponsor or designee will generate the randomization schedule.  All randomization information will be stored in a secured area, accessible only by authorized personnel. 
 Study Drug  Blinding  
The study is double-blind in that neither the subjects nor the Investigator will be aware of the 
treatment or dose administered.  Blinding will be maintained throughout the study by use of active and placebo capsules of similar appearance.  The series of ran dom numbers from which the 
randomization algorithm operates will be created by personnel who will have no other involvement with analysis or statistical decision making for the study.  The random number series will be sequestered from all blinded study personnel, assuring there will be no unblinding information available to them until the study completes.  
 Study Drug  Assignment and Dispensing Procedures  
At Visit 1 (Day 1), subjects who fulfill all the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be  randomized to 
one of the 4  treatment arms using a stratification criterion based on presence of T2DM  (Yes/No ), 
use of Vitamin E  ≥ 400 IU  (Yes/No ) and fibrosis s core ( F1 or F ≥2).  The Investigator or his/her 
delegate will confirm that the subject  fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to 
randomization.  Treatment will be comprised of a 360-day double-blind period, followed by a 14-
day safety follow-up period. Each subject  is uniquely identified in the study by a combination of 
his/her center number and subject  number.  Only the assigned subject  number should be entered 
in the field labeled “subject ID” on the electronic data capture (EDC) form.  Once assigned to a subject , the subject  number will not be reused. 
Subjects , Investigator staff, and persons performing the assessments will remain blinded to the 
identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock, using the following methods:

MSDC -0602K 31-July-2017
 
  
Confidential Page 48 of 68 1. Randomization data are kept  strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not 
be accessible by anyone else involved in the conduct of the study (except for emergency unblinding as noted in S ection  8.9). 
2. The identity of the treatments will be concealed by the use of study drugs that are identical in packaging, labeling, and schedule of administration, appearance, taste and odor. 
Data analysts, who are not directly involved with data management and monitoring of the trial, will remain blinded to individual treatment assignments until the interim analysis  (see 
Section  11.3.4); an unblinded statistician may monitor the randomization process during the trial. 
The Interactive Response System ( IXRS) will maintain a record that identifies each subject and 
the treatmen t/study drug of an individual subject’s treatment assignment. Unblinding of all 
subjects’ treatment assignments will occur at the conclusion of the trial following final database lock. 
 Dispensing the Study Drug  
Each study site will be supplied by Sponsor or Designee with study drug in identically appearing packaging.  The clinical supplies  will be packaged and labeled in a double blind fas hion.  
Medication will be supplied to the site in kits (containing 3 bottles per kit) for each subject .  Each 
bottle wi ll contain medication for 31 days + 2 additional days of treatment, and will have a total 
of 33 capsules  per bottle.  Three bottles will be packaged in a kit .  A three bottle kit will be 
dispensed to subject s at Visits  1, 4, 5, and 6.  Instructions will be provided in order to advise the 
site on the proper method of randomizing the subject and selecting the correct medication ID numbered kit/bottle s for dispensing to a given subject  at a specific visit.  Sites will be resupplied 
additional kits  as supplies diminish.   
On Day 1 , site personnel will administer the first dose of drug with approximately 240 mL of 
water following a minimum 10 -hour overnight f ast.  The study drug kit will then be dispensed to 
the subject  (1 kit containing 3 bot tles each that w ill be dispensed at Visits  1, 4, 5 and 6).  Subject s 
will be instructed to self -administer study drug once daily in the morning at least 30 minutes 
before the morning meal.  They  will be instructed to swallow the drug whole and not to chew or 
open the contents of the capsule.   
One component of the packaging (kit)  has a 2 -part label.  Each part of this label contains a 
medication ID number that will correspond to one of the treatment arms.  Investigator staff will be 
informed which study drug package to dispense to the subject  by contacting and obtaining the 
medication number via IXRS .  Immediately before dispensing study drug to the subject , 
Investigator staff will detach the outer part of the la bel from the kits  and affix them  to the source 
document (Drug Label Form). 
 Study Drug Interruptions  
Treatment interruptio ns should be avoided.  A drug interruption occurring at any time during any 
period will be considered a protocol deviation.  An occasional missed tablet is not considered treatment interruption.  All changes will be recorded in the study records.

 Complianc e 
Treatment compliance will be assessed using capsule counts conducted at V isits 4, 5, 6, and 7.     
 Study Drug Supply, Storage and Tracking  
Study drugs must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the Investigator and designated site staff  have access.  Upon receipt, all study drugs should be stored according to the instructions specified on the drug labels.  Study drug must be kept in a secure cabinet or r oom with access 
restricted to only necessary study site personnel until it is used. Unused medication may be destroyed onsite with sponsor’s approval or returned to the sponsor or designee for destruction.  Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. 
Medication labels will comply with the legal requirements of the U.S .  They will include storage 
conditions for the drug, but no information about the subject .  The Investigator must maintain an 
accurate record of the receipt of shipments and dispensing of study drug in a drug accountability 
ledger.   Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by the monitor during si te visits and 
at the completion of the trial.  
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the Investigator 
will return all used and unused study drug to the Sponsor or designee. 
 Emergency Unblinding   
Unblinding is r estricted to emergency situations and should be used only under circumstances 
where knowledge of the treatment is necessary for the proper management of the subject .  When 
possible, the investigator should attempt to contact the medical monitor at Sponsor or designee before unblinding a subject’s treatment assignment. The randomization code can only be broken if an emergency situation arises that, in the Investigator’s opinion, requires knowledge of the drug 
product dosed for management of the emergency medical condition. To unblind a subject’s  
treatment assignment, the investigator will access the unblinding module within the interactive response system.  Instructions for breaking the blind will be provided to the site .  Unless 
discontinued for a safety reason, study drug may be continued following unblinding of the subject’s treatment assignment.  
Copies of the randomization code will be made available to the analytical laboratory performing the PK analysis of plasma samples at the end of the study.   
9 ADVERS E EVENTS 
 Adverse Events  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the 
subject  using concise medical terminology.  In addition, each subject  will be questioned, in a non-
directed manner about AEs at times specified in Table 1. 
The AE reporting period for this trial begins upon signing of the informed consent form and ends 
at the final study visit (Visit 8).

Confidential Page 50 of 68 All AEs that occur in subject s during the AE reporting period specified in the protocol, whether 
reported in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject , must be re corded on the eCRF in the EDC system regardless of whether or not the event 
is considered medication related.  Information to be collected and reported includes severity of the AE, relationship to study drug, duration of the AE, the treatment the subject i s receiving at the 
time of the AE, and the outcome of the AE.  The Investigator should attempt, if possible, to establish a diagnosis.  For any AE which remains unresolved after completion of the study, the Investigator is responsible for following the AE to resolution or until a reasonable explanation for its persistence is found.  In addition, any known untoward event that occurs subsequent to the adverse event reporting period that the Investigator assesses as possibly related to the investigational medication/product should also be reported as an adverse event.  
 Adverse Event Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or trial subject  that is administered a drug 
or biologic (medicinal product) or that is using a medical device; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage.  Adverse events include the following: 
• All suspected adverse reactions  
• All reactions from overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity.   
• Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a preexisting illness  
• Injury or accidents.  Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident (e.g., a fall secondary to dizziness  or orthostasis ), the medical condit ion 
(dizziness) and the accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate adverse events.  The outcome of the accident (e.g., hip fracture secondary to the fall) should be recorded in source documents. 
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat test). 
• Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond 
ordering a repeat test) unless they are associated with an already reported clinical event.  
Laboratory abnormalities associated with a clinical event (e.g., elevated liver enzymes in a subject  with jaundice) should be captured in the source documents. 
Each adverse event is to be classified by the Investigator as serious or non-serious.  This 
classification of the gravity of the event determines the reporting procedures to be followed.  
 Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as an SAE:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (i.e., at immediate risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important AEs that may not result in death, may not be life -threatening, or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they

MSDC -0602K 31-July-2017
 
  
Confidential Page 51 of 68 may jeopardize the subject or subject  may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above.  
Serious also includes any other event that the Investigator or sponsor company judges to be serious or which is defined as serious by the regulatory agency in the country in which the event occurred.  
A life -threatening AE  is any AE that places the s ubject  at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred.  A life-threatening event does not include an event that might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of death as it actually occurr ed.  For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic 
failure would not be considered life threatening, even though drug-induced hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal.  
Hospitalization is to be considered only as an overnight admission with observation for a  
minimum of 24 hours.  Hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization is a criterion for considering an AE to be serious.  In the absence of an AE, the participating Investigator should not report hospitalizatio n or prolongation of hospitalization as an SAE.  This is the case in the 
following situations: 
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is needed for a procedure required by the protocol.  Day or night survey visits for biopsy or surgery required by the protocol are not considered serious. 
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is part of a routine procedure followed by the study site (e.g., stent removal after surgery).  This should be recorded in the study file. 
• Hospitalization for s urvey visits or annual physicals fall in the same category. 
In addition, a hospitalization planned before the start of the study for a preexisting condition that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE (e.g., elective hospitalization for a total knee replacement due to a pre-existing condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened 
during the course of the study). 
Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions. If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an AE or SAE, the information is to be 
treated as a SAE.  
 Pre-existing Condition Definition  
In this trial, a pre -existing condition (i.e., a disorder present before the AE reporting period started 
and noted on the pretreatment medical history/physical examination form) should not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens or episodes increase in frequency during the adverse event reporting period.

MSDC -0602K 31-July-2017
 
  
Confidential Page 52 of 68 
 Procedures  
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded in the source documents.  If a subject undergoes a surgical procedure that was planned prior to entry into the trial, and the surgery is not performed due to a worsening of a baseline (at the time of informed consent) condition, this should not be reported as an AE.  
 Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
If required on the AE CRFs, the Investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or 
SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event.  For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows: 
MILD   Does not interf ere with subject 's usual function 
MODERATE  Interferes to some extent with subject 's usual function 
SEVERE Interferes significantly with subject 's usual function 
Note the distinction between the gravity and the intensity of an AE.  Severe is a measure of 
intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious reaction.  For example, a headache 
may be severe in intensity but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria 
for serious events listed above. 
 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causal relationship of the AE to study drug will be assessed by both the Investigator and the sponsor.  The following definitions will be used in assessment. 
• Probably Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug adminis tration.  It follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The AE cannot be 
reasonably explained by other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions or concomitant drugs. 
• Possibly Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by other factors such as the subject ’s 
clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs. 
• Unrelated: An AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fr om administration of 
the product or the AE is clearly related to other factors such as the subject ’s clinical state, 
other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the subject . 
 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs , regardless of causal relationship, occurring from the time of signing the informed 
consent through the final study visit (Visit 8), must be reported within 24 hours after the 
Investigator becomes aware of the SAE.  SAEs will be reported by completing the AE eCRF in the EDC system. The SAE information must be entered into the eCRF within 24 hours.  Upon

electronically.  In addition, the clinical site is to  report the SAE using a SAE report form . The 
contact information for submission of SAEs is as follows:    
E-mail:  GlobalSAEInbox@chiltern.com  
Facsimile:  1-888-726-8416 
Clinical safety personnel are available for SAE reporting on a 24- hour basis.  Reports are 
reviewed during normal business hours. The Investigator  is required to submit SAE reports to the 
IRB/EC in accordance with local requirements.  
Follow -up information relating to a n SAE must be updated in the EDC system  and SAE form  
within 24 hours of awareness of the SAE. Chiltern  Clinical Safety will be notified via email when 
the information has been updated in the EDC system.  The subject  should be observed and monitored carefull y until the condition resolves or stabilizes.  
Any emergency event deemed related to study drug must be reported to the Chiltern Clinical 
Safety (within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the event).  
All deaths are to be thoroughly investigated and reporte d.  Autopsy reports are to be obtained, if 
possible. In the rare event that the Investigator  does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (for example, if an outpatient trial subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
Investigator  is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document his/her first 
awareness of the AE.  
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator  after cessation of the investigational 
medication/product and considered to be caused, with a re asonable possibility, by the 
investigational product should be reported to Cirius Therapeutics, Inc. or its designee.  
The Sponsor and/or its Contract Research Organization (CRO) designee is responsible for reporting SAEs to all applicable regulatory agenci es and the central ethics committees within the 
required timeline.  
The Investigator s are responsible for submitting to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
the required safety information including any safety alert letter received from the Sponsor as well as any SAEs occurring at their site.  
Exposure in  Utero  during  Clinical Trials  
Any pregnancy diagnosed in a female subject  or a male subject ’s partner while receiving or 
within 30 days of discontinuing the investigational study drug, must be reported to Cirius Therapeutics, Inc.  or its designee within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy.  The Investigator  
should contact the SAE hotline and r eport  information related to the pregnancy on an Exposure in 
Utero form provided by Cirius Therapeutics, Inc.  or its designee.  If a female subject  who is

10 STUDY DURATION 
The total duration of the study will be approximately 416 days; comprised of a Screening period 
of up to 42 days, maximum, a treatment period of 360 days and a 14-d ay follow -up period. 
11 STATISTICS  
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures.  A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) that details the statistical methods for the study will be finalized prior to any unblinded analysis of the study. 
 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
Each active treatment group will be compared with the placebo group at the two-sided 0.05 significance level; 85 subjects per arm provides approximately 80% power to detect a difference in the proportions of subjec ts achieving the primary efficacy endpoint of 39.5% in any MSDC -
0602K group versus 20% response rate in the placebo group. These response rates are similar to effects reported after 18 months daily treatment with 45 mg pioglitazone (58% response) or placeb o (17% response) in subjects  with pre-diabetes or T2DM ( 32
); after 96 weeks daily 
treatment with 30 mg pioglitazone (34% response) or placebo (19%) in non -diabetic adults with 
NASH in the PIVENS study  (34); and in the GOLDEN study, after 52 weeks daily treatment with 
120 mg elafibranor (32% response) or placebo (21%) in the subset of NASH subjects  with a 
baseline NAS ≥ 4 ( 35).  Assuming 10% of subjects will not complete the 12-month assessment 
due to early dropout, 380 subjects will be randomized to the study. 
 Analysis Set  
Final decisions regarding the assignment of subjects to analysis sets will be made during the Validity Review Meeting  and documented in the Validity Review Report. Data from sites with 
serious GCP or quality concerns may be excluded from the analyses .  
Enrolled Set 
All subjects who signed informed consent. 
Modified Intent- to-Treat Analysis Set   
The modified Intent- to-Treat (m ITT) analysis set  includes all subjects who are randomized  and 
who receive at least one dose of study drug. Pre -treatment baseline measures and post- baseline 
assessments through 14 days after the last dose of study drug will be included i n the analyses.   
Subjects in the m ITT will be analyzed  as randomized  regardless of treatment received .  This 
means that subjects who are randomized who receive the incorrect study drug (i.e., not the study drug to which they were randomized) will be analyz ed for efficacy under mITT as in the

MSDC -0602K 31-July-2017
 
  
Confidential Page 55 of 68 treatment group to which the subject was randomized.  The primary population for efficacy analyses is the m ITT. 
Safety  Analysis Set  
Safety analysis set (SAF) includes  all subjects who  are randomized and  received at least one dose 
of study drug.  SAF  will be used in the analyses of all safety endpoints.  Subjects will be included 
in the analyses according to the actual treatment they received.   If a subject incorrectly receives 
more than one dose of study drug, the subject will be analyzed in the treatment group corresponding to the highest dose received. Pre -treatment baseline measures and post- baseline 
assessments through 14 days after the last dose of study drug will be included in th e analyses.  
Per-Protocol Analysis Set 
The per -protocol analysis set (PPS) includes all subjects in the m ITT population without major 
protocol deviations.  Identification of all subjects in the PPS will be determined before the 
database lock and unblinding.   Post-baseline measures during follow-up periods where the subject  was < 80% compliant with study drug dosing may be excluded from the PPS.  The PPS 
will be used as an additional sensitivity analysis for key efficacy endpoints.   
 Planned Methods of Analysis  
The principal analysis for the primary endpoint will employ the m ITT analysis set and the per -
protocol approach will be considered supportive.  Safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis set . 
Continuous variables will be summarized using mean, median, standard deviations, 25
th and 75th 
percentiles, min, and max.  Categorical variables will be summarized using number and percentages.  All statistical tests and confidence intervals are two -sided unless otherwise stated. 
 Analysis of Key Study Endpoints  
 Efficacy Analysis  
Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is hepatic histological improvement in NAS (NASH CRN scoring). A responder (subjects with hepatic histological improvement) is defined as having all of followings: 
(1) At least 2 point reduction in NAS at 12 months. The reduction in NAS must also include at least  a 1 point reduction in either ballooning or inflammation.  
(2) No worsening of fibrosis, defined as no increase in CRN fibrosis score.  
Each MSDC -0602K dose group will be compared with the placebo group at the two-sided 0.05 
significance level. For each comparison, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in response rates between the MSDC -0602K dose and placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that 
there is a difference in response rates between the MSDC -0602K dose and placebo.  The primary 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed in the mITT, with supportive analysis

Confidential  Page 56 of 68  in the PPS.  The number and percentage of responders will be summarized by treatment group.  
The primary analysis will be conducted using observed data included in the analysis dataset.  Sensitivity analyses will be  conducted where missing values are multiply imputed, and where 
subjects  with missing data will be treated as non -responders. Comparisons between each active 
treatment group and the placebo group will be evaluated using appropriate contrasts from a logistic regression model that includes adjustments for the randomization stratification factors (presence of diabetes mellitus, Vitamin E use ≥ 400 IU, and baseline fibrosis 1 versus ≥ 2) and baseline NAS. Model -adjusted odds ratios for each active dose group re lative to placebo and their 
associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided. In addition, stratification- adjusted 
differences in response rates between each active dose group and placebo and their associated 95% CIs will be provided.  
Supportive  analyses of the primary endpoint will include comparisons of each active dose group 
with placebo using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) tests adjusting for the randomization 
stratification factors. Sensitivity analysis for primary endpoint will be performed using a logistic 
regression model adjusting for treatment, gender, presence of diabetes mellitus, Vitamin E use ≥ 
400 IU, baseline fibrosis and baseline NAS .  Adjusted odds ratios relative to placebo and the 
corresponding 95% CIs and p- values will be provi ded.  
Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
Secondary Endpoint s 
Primary analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted in the mITT with supportive analyses in the PPS.  
Proportion of subjects  with resolution of NASH   
Resolution of NASH is defined as a ballooning score of 0 and an inflammation score of 0- 1 
without worsening of fibrosis at month 12.  No worsening of fibrosis is defined as no increase in 
CRN fibrosis score.  
The incidence rate of  resolution of NASH will be summarized by treatment group.  Each active 
treatment group will be compared to the placebo group using appropriate contrasts from a logistic regression model that includes adjustments for the randomization stratification factors  and 
baseline NAS . Model -adjusted odds ratios for each acti ve dose group relative to placebo and their 
associated 95% CIs will be provided.  In addition, stratification -adjusted rate differences  and their 
associated 95% CI s will be provided.  Supportive analyses will include comparisons of each 
active dose group w ith placebo using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) tests adjusting for the 
randomization stratification factors.  A logistic regression mode l adjusting for treatment, gender, 
presence of diabetes mellitus, Vitamin E use ≥ 400 IU, baseline fibrosis and baselin e NAS  will be 
used as sensitivity analysis .  Adjusted odds  ratio s relative to placebo and the corresponding 95% 
CIs and p -values will be provided.   
Proportion of subjects  with improvement  of fibrosis by at least 1 stage with  no worsening of 
NAS H at 12 months

Confidential Page 57 of 68 Reduction of fibrosis is  measured by CRN staging score.  All subjects with CRN staging score ≥ 
1 decrease from baseline will be considered as responders. Worsening of NASH is defined as an increase of either ballooning or inflammation.  
The incidence rate of the responders will be summarized by treatment group.  Each active 
treatment group will be compared to the placebo group using appropriate contrasts from a logistic regression model that includes adjustment for the ran domization stratification factors  and baseline 
NAS . Adjusted odds ratios relative to placebo and their associated 95% CI s will be provided.  In 
addition, stratification -adjusted rate differences and their associated 95% CIs will be provided.  A 
logistic re gression model adjusting for tre atment, gender, presence of diabetes mellitus, baseline 
fibrosis and baseline NAS will be used  as sensitivity analysis .  Adjusted odds ratios relative to 
placebo and the corresponding 95% CIs  and p-values will be provided.   
Mean change from baseline in NAS and each one of its components (steatosis, inflammation and ballooning) at 12 months. 
For each of these outcomes separately, t he change from baseline to 12 months will be analyzed 
using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed terms for treatment, type 2 
diabetes, Vitamin E ≥ 400 IU, gender, fibrosis stage, baseline NAS and the baseline value of the component score where applicable.    Least square mean treatment differences relative to placebo  
and associated 95% CIs will be presented .   
Mean change from baseline in fibrosis score at 12 months 
Mean change in fibrosis score will be analyzed similarly as the mean change in NAS  above.   
Exploratory Endpoints 
For change from baseline endpoints, the mean  change will be summarized by treatment groups at 
each evaluation time  point.  Highly skewed variables will be log-transformed for analysis, and 
geometric mean changes presented.  Comparisons between each active dose and placebo will be 
done using ANCOVA model s, similarly as for secondary endpoints.  
 Safety Analysis  
Adverse Events  
Safety data will be summarized i n the Safety analysis set .  All AEs  will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities (MedDRA).  Treatment -emergent AEs are those 
with an onset after the first dose of study drug or any event already present that worsens in either 
intensity or frequency following exposure to the study treatment. Adverse events with an onset between signing of informed consent and study drug initiation, and those with an onset more than 
14 days after the last dose of study drug will be listed separately.  The incidence of treatment -
emergen t AEs, serious AEs, AEs resulting in study drug discontinuation, AEs at least possibly 
related to study drug, and fatal SAEs will be summarized by system organ class and AE preferred 
term in each treatment group.  A summary of treatment- emergent AEs by preferred term and 
severity, using the worst reported severity grade for each event for a given subject, will be presented.

Descriptive  statistics for laboratory parameter values, and for values of changes from baseline, by 
treatment group and visit, will be provided.  The occurrence of significant ly abnormal change s in 
laboratory values from baseline will be summarized by treatment group.  Graphical 
representations may also be presented.  
 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Summary statistics will be provided by treatment group for demographics (e.g. age, sex, race, and 
ethnicity) and for baseline characteristics including medical history and randomization stratification factors . 
 Study Drug  Exposure, Complianc e, and Concomitant Therapies  
Overall percent compliance to study drug dosage regimen, calculated as percent of doses taken relative to doses scheduled to be taken, will be summarized by treatment group.  Extent of exposure in days will be evaluated and summarized from the first dose date to the last dose date of randomized study drug . 
Study drug capsule count will be conducted at Visit 2 (1 month), Visit 3 ( 2 months), Visit 4 
(3 months), Visit 5 (6 months), Visit 6 (9 Months), and Visit 7 (12 months).  For the periods of 
Visit 1 to Visit 4, Visit 4 to Visit 5, Visit 5 to Visit 6, and Visit 6 to Visit 7, percent compliance 
with study drug during each period will be calculated as the actual number of capsules taken divided by the number of capsules required, then multiplied by 100.  The required number of capsules will be calculated as the number of capsules per day (1 ) times the number of treatment 
days in the period, which will be determined using the start date and the end date of the period.  For example, the number of treatment days for Visit 4 to Visit 5 will be calculated by the date of Visit 5 minus the date of Visit 4.  If a subject ’s study drug or study participation is discontinued 
early during any of the periods, last dose date +14 day s will be used as the end of period.  If the 
date of last dose is missing, the last clinic visit date during the period will be used to estimate the end of the period.  As a summary, the following formula will be used to calculate the compliance:  
        
At the end of each period, efficacy measurements with a compliance less than 80% will be considered for exclusion  from per -protocol analys es.  The subjects with a compliance less than 
80% will be reviewed by the medical monitor and Cirius Therapeutics, Inc.  Efficacy measurements to be excluded from the per-protocol analyses will be pre -specified prior to 
unblindi ng treatment codes for analyses.  
Overall compliance of the 12 -month double- blind treatment period will also be calculated and  
summarized.  In addition, counts and percents will be produced to show in each treatment group with exposure in the following categories: 1 – ≤  90 days, 91 – ≤  180 days, 181 – ≤ 270 days, and 
271 – ≤ 360 days.

capsules per day ( 1) times the number of treatment days, which will be determined using the 
randomization date a nd clinic visit date for Visit 7/Day 360.  For subjects who discontinue the 
study or who discontinue study drug early, the last clinic visit date during period when the subject was on double- blind treatment will be used.  
Concomitant medication/therapy verbatim terms will be coded using the latest version of the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.  The number and percentage of subject s 
taking concomitant medications will be summarized by Anatomic & Therapeutic Chemical classification and preferred term for each treatment group.  
No formal statistical tests  are planned for all of the variables stated above. 
 Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup analysis will be performed for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.   
The subgroups examined  will include diabetics vs. non- diabetics, use of Vitamin E ≥  400 IU  (Yes  
v. No) , F2+3 vs. F1, and by PNPLA3 genotype .  The homogeneity of the effect of each active 
dose relative to placebo across each subgroup will be assessed using appropriate contrasts in a logistic regression model that includes terms for the treatment groups, the subgroup under consideration, and their interaction, together with the randomization stratification factors.  Additional subgroup analyses will be described in the SAP.  
 Other endpoints  
Vital signs, physical exam and ECG QTc intervals will also be summarized descriptively.   
 Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Plasma concentrations will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. Individual subject and mean plasma MSDC -0602 and MSDC-0597 concentr ations will be plotted 
vs. time .  Additional details for pharmacokinetic analysis will be specified in the pharmacokinetic 
analysis plan . 
 Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis  of exploratory and safety endpoints is planned after all subjects have been 
randomized into the study and 6-month data are available for a minimum of  300 randomized 
subjects . Changes in serum biomarkers from baseline to 6 months will be assessed. Biomarkers 
include: 
• Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, albumin, PT and INR) 
• Circulating inflammatory marke rs (HMW adiponectin and hsCRP) 
• Markers of bone metabolism (osteocalcin and serum CTX), FFA , serum triglycerides and 
fasting cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL, VLDL),) 
• Markers of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and fasting insulin ).  Markers of insulin sensitivity will be analyzed separately in subjects with and 
without T2DM.

13 CLINICAL AND L ABORATORY DATA COLLECTION  
 Case Report Forms  
An electronic version of the CRF data collection form (eCRFs) for each subject  will be provided.  
All appropriate subject data gathered during the study will be recorded in English on these forms. 
Whenever possible, all information requested on a CRF sheet or entered directly into an eCRF  
should be completed.  If information is not available, it should be documented as such.  Paper 
based forms should be filled out with a black or blue ballpoint pen.  All deletions and corrections must be made by drawing a single line through the error and writing the correct information next to the change.  All corrections must be initialed and dated.  Correction fluid must not be used.  A tracki ng system for changes to the eCRFs (i.e., an audit system) will be available.  
The completed CRFs or completed print out and/or electronic copy of the eCRFs  for this study 
are the property of Cirius Therapeutics, Inc.  and should not be made available to third parties, 
except for authorized representatives of appropriate health/regulatory authorities, without written permission from Cirius Therapeutics, Inc. 
 Laboratory Results 
Laboratory tests (clinical chemistry and hematology) will be analyzed by a central laboratory and reported to the clinical site as results are generated.  The Investigator will review and comment on 
any laboratory value reported outside the normal range provided by the central laboratory.  The laboratory report must be signed and kept in the study subject  file at the site for the Sponsor.  The 
electronic copies of the laboratory data will represent the clinical chemistry and hematology source data.

Confidential  Page 67 of 68  APPENDIX 1  - ADA DIABETIC DIET GUIDELINES  
• Meal  plans  are balanced  
o They include breakfast , lunch, dinner, and two snacks.  
o Each one -day plan includes about 8 servings of fruits and vegetables.  
o Fruits and vegetables are included at almost every meal and snack.  
• 1550- 1650 calories  per day 
o Your calorie level may vary based on your age, gender, activity level and whether or not you need to lose weight. 
o Calories are spaced throughout the d ay between meals and two snacks.  
o We also include tips each month to add or cut total calories by 200.  
• Moderate -carbohydrate (about  45% of  calories  come from  carbohydrate)  
o Carbohydrate  intake is spread throughout the day.  
o Most meals have 45 -60 grams of carbohydrate.  
o Most snacks have 10- 25 grams of carbohydrate.  
o We also provide tips on how to adjust each meal plan to make it lower in carbohydrates. 
• Limit  trans -fat as  much  as possible,  <10% of  calories  from  saturated  fat, and focus  on 
healthy  or "good"  fat sources  
o People with diabetes have a higher -than-average risk of having a heart attack or stroke. Due to 
their connection with heart disease risk, the amount of  saturated  and trans -fats in our meal plans is 
limited. Trans fat and satu rated fats are sometimes referred to as "bad fats."  
o "Good fats" include monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and may promote heart health. Meal plans include these over "bad fats" as much as possible. 
• 300 mg  of cholesterol  per day 
o Your body makes some cholesterol on its own but you also get cholesterol from food. People with 
diabetes should have 300 mg or less per day.  
o Some foods, like shrimp and eggs, are fairly nutritious foods but are somewhat high in cholesterol. Meal plans may include these foods because they provide other benefits or help to balance the plan.  
• >25 grams  of dietary  fiber per day 
o You get fiber from plant -based foods like whole grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds and beans. 
o People with diabetes should consume at least the recommende d amount of fiber for the general 
population: about 25 grams per day for women and 38 grams per day for men. Many Americans only get about half of what is recommended.  
• 2300 mg  of sodium  or less per day 
o Watching sodium is important for blood pressure control.  
o The American Diabetes Association recommends 2300 mg of sodium or less per day.  
o If you have diabetes and hypertension, you should work with your health care team to see if further reduction of sodium intake is necessary.  
o The current food supply is packe d with hidden sources of  sodium , and most Americans are 
consuming closer to 3400 mg of sodium per day. You can take some simple steps to reducing the sodium in your diet by learning what foods are major sources of sodium, making smart food choices, and controlling portion sizes.

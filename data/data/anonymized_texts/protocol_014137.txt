 DOCUMENT HISTORY  
Version  Date  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
1.0 26Jul2021  n/a Initial protocol  
2.0 19Aug2021  Added  clinical relevance  endpoint 
(lower bound of the two-sided 95% 
CI for the seroresponse rate in adults 
≥65 years of age must be ≥60% ). Omitted from initial protocol 
inadvertently.  
3.0 17Sep2021  Changed primary  immunogenicity 
objective to demonstrate superiority 
to placebo from inferiority to EBSI -
CV-317-004. Added preliminary 
group unblinded immunogenicity 
analysis . Change in PXVX0317 program strategy 
and allowing for earlier regulatory  
interactions prior to final database lock.  
4.0 25Jan 2022  Removed intra articular  steroids from 
exclusion criteria 7  
Added labelling informatio n in 
section 5.1.3  
Updated Adverse Event collection to 
begin at Day 1  
Rearranged Immunogenicity 
endpoints  
Reasons for allowing rescreening 
were expanded  Intraarticular  steroids were erroneously 
mentioned as allowed in earlier versions 
of the protocol.  
Section 5.1.3 was modif ied to better 
align with ICH E6(R2) GCP  and 
Emergent’s  updated protocol template.  
Adverse event collection was  updated 
per FDA request  that any event that 
begins prior to first vaccine 
administration be reported as medical 
history . 
Immunogenicity endpoints were 
reprioritized  per EMA Scientific Advi ce. 
Rescreening was aligned with EBSI -CV-
317-004 protocol.  
5.0 27Jul2022  
 Added explorator y objective and 
endpoint to e valuate the ability of 
CHIKV antibodies to PXVX0317 to 
neutralize different CHIKV 
genotypes . Clarified inclusion 
criterion for participants who test 
positive for COVID -19. Clarified 
definition of MAAE.  Addition of exploratory o bjective and 
endpoint to the protocol per EMA 
Scientific Advice.   
Reasons for delay of vaccination were  
updated to clarify that vaccination of 
potential participants  with evidence of 
active SARS -CoV -2 virus  infection 
should be delayed (or not enrolled) to 
reduce the risk of confounding safety 
and immune response data.  
MAAE definition was clarified  to ensure 
consistent reporting of events , as 
intended  for this clinical study.  
6.0 See effective 
date Study objectives and endpoints have 
been updated  and reorganized  and 
GMT analysis was removed from 
hierarchical testing .  
  and EMA definition 
of seroresponse rate as the 
presumptive seroprotection rate.  Simplification for global use of the 
protocol  and t o align with FDA and 
EMA feedback received 26Jul2022 and 
25Jan2023, respectively.

 This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study with 
two treatment groups.  Participant s will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a 
single intramuscular (IM) dose of PXVX0317 or placebo at Day 1.  
The target population is adults ≥65 years of age. Participant s will be stratified by age 
subgroups (65 to <75 and ≥75 years of age), with a target of 25% enrollment of 
participant s ≥75 years of age. With 400 participant s enrolled, the treatment group totals are 
estimated as follows:  
• Group 1 - PXVX0317: n=2 00 
• Group 2 - Placebo: n=200  
An independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will provide safety oversight. The 
SMC will review aggregated, blinded safety data after the first 50 participant s have 
completed seven  days of safety follow -up. The remaining participant s will be enrolled 
following the safety review by the SMC and based on the sponsor’s consideration of the 
SMC’s recommendation .

adversely impact the participant’s participation in or conduct of the study.  
Reasons for Delay of Study V accination : 
i. Any fever (oral temperature ≥100.4 °F [≥38 .0°C]) within 24 hours of planned study 
vaccination.  
ii. Any condition that may interfere with as sessment of reactogenicity and/or other  
safety asses sments .

seroresponse rate (PXVX0317 minus placebo) with associated 95% CIs at Day 15  
and Day 183, in that order (see Section 9.6.2 ). 
• Anti-CHIKV SNA GMTs by study arm with associated 95% CIs at Day 15 and Day 
183.  
• Geometric mean fold increase (GMFI) from Day 1 to subsequent collection time 
points.  
• Number and percentage of participants  with an anti -CHIKV SNA titer ≥15 and 
4-fold rise over baseline.  
Exploratory Immuno genicity Endpoint:  
• Geometric mean titers  and associated two -sided 95% CIs for neutralizing antibodies 
against various  CHIKV genotypes measured at Day 22 (and at baseline if necessary) 
for a subset of participants  in the PXVX 0317 group . 
Procedures and Assessments:   
Study procedures/assessments will occur at: Screening (Visit 1), to occur no more than 30 
days prior to Day 1 of IP administration; Day 1 (Visit 2, Baseline, Randomization, and IP 
Administration); Day 15 (Visit 3); Day 22 (Visit 4); Day 29 (Visit 5, teleph one contact); 
Day 92 (Visit 6, telephone contact); Day 183 (Visit 7, End of Study) or Early 
Discontinuation Visit  (EDV) . The per -participant  estimated total study duration is 212 
days (includes the 30-day screening window ).  
Solicited AEs (collected from D ay 1 through Day 8) will consist of local adverse reactions 
(injection site pain, redness , and swelling) and systemic adverse reactions (fever, chills, 
fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia , and nausea). Unsolicited  AEs will be collected from 

PXVX0317    
Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 11 of 78 
 
 Day 1 throug h Day 29. S erious adverse event s, MAAEs , and AESI  will be collected from 
Day 1 through Day 183 End of Study Visit.   
The immune response to PXVX0317 will be measured by CHIKV  SNA  responses up to 
182 days after dosing (Day 183). CHIKV  SNA levels will be measured by a validated 
CHIKV luciferase -based assay ( hereafter referred to as human SNA assay) developed by 
the sponsor  (see Section 7 for human SNA assay description) . 
Statistical Methods : 
Seroresponse rates : Proportions (percentages) of participant s in PXVX0317 and placebo 
groups with a seroresponse at Day 15, Day 22, and Day 183 will be summarized with 
two-sided 95% CIs based on the Wilson score method.  This analysis will be primarily 
based in the immunogenicity evaluable population  (IEP) and repeated for the modified 
intent -to-treat (mITT) population as a measure of the robustness of the findings . The 
significance of the treatment group dif ference will be assessed using chi -square test s at 
each visit  based on both age groups combined  with a  two-sided  alpha=0.05.  
The difference in CHIKV  SNA seroresponse rates ( PXVX0317  minus placebo ) among 
baseline seronegative participant s will be calculated  along with the two-sided 95% CI for 
the difference based on the Newcombe hybrid score method  at Day 15, Day 22, and Day 
183. At Day 22, t he lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in 
seroresponse rates ( PXVX0317  minus placebo ) for both age strata combined must meet or  
exceed  for clinical relevance  to be demonstrated.  
Geometric mean titers : Geometric mean titers  will be derived from a linear analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) model with log 10-transformed CHIKV SNA titers as the de pendent 
variable and treatment group and study site as fixed effect s. The adjusted least square 
means and their two-sided 95% CIs calculated based on the ANOVA model will be back 
transformed and reported as the PXVX0317 and placebo group GMT values at Day 15, 
Day 22, and Day 183.  Significance testing  will be carried out at a two -sided significance 
level of 0.05  using both age strata combined . 
Geometric mean fold increase : Geometric mean fold increase  in CHIKV SNA titers  from 
Day 1 to Day 15, Day 22, and Day  183 will be reported for PXVX0317 and placebo 
groups . 
Four -fold rise over baseline in CHIKV  SNA titer : Proportions (percentages) of participant s 
in PXVX0317 and placebo groups with a CHIKV  SNA titer of at least 4 -fold rise over 
baseline at Day 15, Day 22,  and Day 183 will be summarized with two -sided 95% CIs 
based on the Wilson score method.  
Safety endpoints : The safety of PXVX0317 in adults ≥65 years of age will be evaluated 
using solicited AEs occurring from IP administration on Day 1 until Day 8 , unsoli cited 
AEs through Day 29, MAAEs, AESI , and SAEs though Day 183 End of Study Visit, and 
vital signs. Solicited AEs include local (pain, redness, and swelling) and systemic reactions 
(fever, chills, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea).

Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 12 of 78 
 
 Sample  Size Considerations:  Based on the data from the phase 2 study (protocol 
PXVX -CV-317-001), the seroresponse rate for PXVX0317 vaccine is expected to be 
approximately  v s <5% for the placebo participant s. With an assumed 10% rate of 
nonevaluable participant s, the power to show superiority over placebo with 180 
PXVX0317 vaccine and 180 placebo evaluable participant s is >99.9% for the combined 
age groups.  
The difference in seroresponse rate between PXVX0317 and placebo groups that is 
considered cli nically relevant is . With 180 PXVX0317 -treated participant s and a 
target seroresponse rate of  vs a rate of 5% for placebo, the width of a two -sided 95% 
CI would be ± 5.4%. If the target PXVX0317 seroresponse is , the width would be 
±6.9% . Theref ore, the  difference in seroresponse rate s must be above  for the lower 
bound of the 95% CI for the difference to be .  
Analysis Populations  
Enrolled  population : All screened participants who sign the inf ormed consent form 
(ICF), are entered in the electronic data capture (EDC ) database and  meet all eligibility 
criteria . 
Randomized population: All screened participant s who provide informed consent and 
provide demographic and other screening measurements and are randomized.  
Exposed population: All participant s in the randomized population who receive IP.  
Safety population: All participant s in the exposed population who provide safety 
assessment data. Safety endpoints will utilize the safety population, analyzed as treated.  
Modified intent to treat popu lation: All randomized participant s who are vaccinated and 
have at least one postinjection CHIKV SNA titer result, analyzed as randomized.  
Immunogenicity evaluable population:  All participant s in the mITT population who: i) 
provide eva luable serum sample results for the Day 22 time point within the required time 
frame  (Days 19 to 27) ; ii) have no measurable CHIKV SNA at Day 1 ; iii) have no 
important protocol deviation or other reason to be excluded as defined prior to unblinding.  
The IEP is the primary pop ulation for all immunogenicity analyses.  
Preliminary  Analysis : There will be a safety and immunogenicity preliminary  analysis  on 
data for all participants through the Day 29 visit to  facilitate health authority 
presubmission  preparation . The analyses will  be performed by a third -party vendor and 
unblinded results will be reported only at the  treatment group  summary level preserving 
the double -blind status on the participant  level.  No p -value penalty will be assessed 
because the Day 22 primary immunogenicit y endpoint data will be final at the time of 
preliminary analysis  and no action regarding the study will be made based on these 
findings .

 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
1.1 Name and Description of I nvestigational Product (s) 
PXVX0317 is a CHIKV  VLP  vaccine. The vaccine is comprised of 40 μg CHIKV VLP 
adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide  2% adjuvant (2% [w/w] aqueous suspension of aluminum 
hydroxide , Alhydrogel®) and stabilized with formulation buffer, supplied as a single dose of 
0.8 mL in a pre -filled syringe to be administered IM in the deltoid  muscle .  
Placebo (diluent) is a sterile aqueous solution with the same excipient composition as the 
PXVX 0317  drug product without CHIKV VLP or aluminum hydroxide  components . 
For additional study vaccine information, see Section 5.1 and the PXVX0317 Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB).   
1.1.1 Indication  
The target indication for PXVX0317 vaccine is for active immunization to prevent disease 
caused by CHIKV . 
1.2 Chikungunya Virus and Dise ase Background  
Chikungunya virus is an arthropod -borne alphavirus of the family Togaviridae . The CHIKV 
virion contains a positive -sense single -strand RNA genome with a long open reading frame 
coding for capsid (C) and envelope (E1, E2, E3, and 6K) structur al proteins, together with 
four nonstructural proteins (nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4 ) required for replication of the virus . 
Since the first case reports of CHIKV in a 1952 –1953 outbreak in Tanzania (1), this disease 
has been endemic in Africa and parts of Asia with transmission occurring through Aedes 
aegypti  and more recently via Aedes albopictus  mosquitoes (2).  
Beginning in 2014, CHIKV disease cases were reported among US travelers returning from 
affected areas in the Americas and local transmission was identified in Florida, Puerto Rico, 
and the US Virgin Islands. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
approximately 117  countries or territories have documented cases of CHIKV infection 
excluding those countries where only imported cases have been documented ( Figure 1 
adapted from  (3)). Although mosquitoes are the primary mode of transmission of CHIKV, 
blood -borne transmission via needle stick is possible. Maternal -fetal transmission has been 
documented during pregnancy (4).

 Figure 1 Chikungunya Virus  Global Burden (adapted from (3)) 
 
Following an incubation period of 2 to 12 days, acute clinical manifestations include high 
fever, rash, gastrointe stinal complications, headache, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, 
and joint pain (5, 6, 7). The most classic symptom of chikungunya is a debilitating 
polyarthralgia that is present in greater than 90% of cases (8). This acute phase resolve s 
within several weeks, but joint pain and arthritis may persist for months or years in over 25% 
to 40% of infected individuals (9). The frequency and severity of arthritic sequelae are higher 
in older adults  (10). 
Currently t here are no approved vaccines to prevent CHIKV infection or disease. However, 
protection against subsequent infection has been shown to correlate with the presence of 
CHIKV antibo dies that neutralize the virus in vitro  (11, 12).  
1.3 Summary of Findings from Nonclinical Studies  
The sponsor conducted a study in mice that demonstrated comparability between the immune 
responses induced by the VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP (discussed in Section 1.4) and 
PXVX0317 vaccines. Following this, the sponsor conducted a pilot challenge study in 
cynomolgus macaques nonhuman primates (NHP) to determine the CHIKV challenge dose 
required to induce signs of arthritis, as quantified  by degree of  inflammation of the joints and 
surrounding tissues in infected animals . A scoring system was developed to measure the 
degree of joint infiltration  and a  challenge dose of 107 plaque forming units (PFUs) of 
CHIKV La Reunion outbreak strain LR2006 -OPY1 was selected as the optimal dose  to 

PXVX0317    
Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 24 of 78 
 
 induce signs of arthritis in NHPs.  An NHP  active vaccination and challenge study with the 
PVXV0317 vaccine  followed . Nonhuman primates  received two IM immunizations (on 
study Days 0 and 28) with VLP (1.25, 6, or 20 µg) adjuva nted with alum (300 µg), VLP 
alone (20 µg) , or alum alone, followed by challenge with 107 (PFU) of CHIKV strain 
LR2006 -OPY1.   
Data from the study demonstrate that all three dose levels of the PXVX0317 vaccine, 
including 20  µg without alum, induced a robus t immune response as measured by CHIKV 
luciferase serum neutralizing antibody assay for NHP serum ( NHP SNA Assay) , even after a 
single immunization. Importantly, the addition of alum increased the prechallenge SNA titers 
compared to the VLP vaccine without  alum. Furthermore, vaccination completely protected 
NHPs from viremia, as measured by plaque assay on serum from challenged animals. Joint 
pathology scores in the active vaccination study demonstrate that vaccination with 
PXVX0317 protects NHPs from joint  infiltration in a dose -dependent manner. Quantitative 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT -qPCR) analysis (by NHP RT -qPCR 
assay) of joint tissues showed significantly lower levels of viral RNA in tissues of vaccinated 
animals, which rarely had detectable RNA, compared with animals that had received only 
alum. Taken together, these data suggest that vaccination induced CHIKV SNA prot ects 
cynomolgus macaques from developing CHIKV disease following viral challenge.  
In addition, Emergent conducted a passive transfer and challenge study in cynomolgus 
macaque NHPs. Human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from plasma of volunteers 
vaccinated  with PXVX0317 was passively transferred to NHPs at three dose levels (5, 15 , 
and 100 mg/kg, resulting in SNA titers at time of challenge of 1:38, 1:101, and 1:644, 
respectively) followed by CHIKV (strain LR2006 -OPY1 ) challenge. All three dose levels of 
IgG purified  from plasma of PXVX0317 vaccinated participants protected NHPs from 
viremia as measured by plaque assay. Human IgG administration also appears to protect 
NHPs from joint pathology in a dose -dependant manner. Results indicate that purified human 
IgG at an SNA titer of 1:38 is sufficient to protect NHPs against viremia as measured by 
plaque assay following CHIKV challenge.  
1.4 Literature and Data Relevant to the Trial  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Vaccine Research Center (VRC) initiated the 
development of the CHIKV VLP vaccine, designated VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP. The VRC 
completed phase 1 (VRC  311) (13, 14) and phase 2 (VRC 704) (15, 16) clinical studies. 
PaxVax Inc. then manufactured the vaccine as PXVX0317, conducted a mouse 
immuno genicity study showing comparability to the VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP vaccine, and 
proceeded to a phase 2 study (PXVX -CV-317-001) (17). PaxVax Inc. was acquired by 
Emergent  BioSolutions, Inc. in October 2018, and has been renamed Emergent Travel Health 
Inc. (Emergent) as the sponsor of two phase 2 studies (PXVX -CV-317-001 and 
EBSI -CV-317-002), a phase 3 study (EBSI -CV-317-004) and this phase 3 study .

 1.4.1 Clinical Study VRC 311  
The safety and immunogenicity of VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP were evaluated under BB -IND 
14907 in VRC  311, a phase 1 open -label, dose -escalation study (13, 14). Healthy adult 
participants 18 to 50 years of age were assigned to sequential dose level groups to receive IM 
injections of 10 µg, 20 µg, or 40 µg (without adjuvant) on Weeks 0, 4 , and 20, with 
follow -up for 44 weeks after enrollment. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability 
of the vaccine. Secondary endpoints were CHIKV -specific immune responses assessed by 
neutralizing antibody assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assa y (13, 14).   
All injections were well tolerated, with no SAEs reported. The  most common local reaction 
was mild injection site pain (36%) and the most common systemic reaction was mild malaise 
(24%). No moderate or severe reactogenicity was observed (13, 14). 
Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all dose groups after the second vaccination. The 
GMT of the half maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was 2688 in the 10 µg group, 
1775 in the 20 µg group, and 7246 in the 40 µg group, and a significant boost occurred after 
the third vaccination in all dose groups (10 µg group p=0.0197, 20  µg group p<0.0001, and 
40 µg group p<0.0001). Four weeks after th e third vaccination, the GMT of the IC 50 was 
8745 for the 10 µg group, 4525 for the 20 µg group, and 5390 for the 40 µg group (13, 14). 
These findings were confirmed by both a plaque reduction assay and the sponsor’s 
luciferase -based assay ( human SNA assay) (18), confirming both the immunogenicity of the 
VLP and the suitability of human SNA  assay for future studies (see Section 7 for assay 
details).  
1.4.2 Clinical Study VRC 704  
The NIH VRC 704 was a phase 2 study conducted at multiple CHIKV -endemic sites in the 
Caribbean (15, 16). The study was a double -blind, placebo -controlled study with 200 
participants (planned) receiving  20 µg of CHIKV VLP and 200 receiving placebo in a 
two-dose series at Weeks 0 and 4. The study was initiated in 2016 and completed in 2018. 
Approximately 20% of participants demonstrated detectable CHIKV neutralizing antibodies 
at baseline using the focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) reported as EC 50 values. 
EC 50 is the dilution of sera that inhibits 50% infection in viral neutralization assay. 
Chikun gunya virus  VLP appeared safe and well tolerated in participants who were followed 
through Week 72, with no related SAEs or other safety concerns (15, 16). Chikungunya virus  
VLP appeared highly immunogenic, with a GMT of 2004.5 and 99.5% of recipients having 
neutralizing antibodies at Week 8. A boosting effect of SNA after administration of CHIKV 
VLP was also observed in participants with base line CHIKV neutralizing antibodies (15, 16). 
Specimens from VRC 704 were al so analyzed ad hoc  by the sponsor, using the human SNA 
assay. A subgroup analysis was performed on participants without baseline CHIKV 
neutralizing activity. Using a more stringent 80% neutralization cut -off (NT 80), the GMT was 
123 at Week 4 and 1701 at Week 8. After Week 8, antibody levels declined by about 1 log 
but remained elevated above baseline, with GMTs of 213 at Week 24, 115 at Week 48, and 
100 at Week 72, indicating that long -term protection can potential ly be achieved without the

 need for booster dose(s). These results demonstrated that CHIKV VLP was safe and 
immunogenic in adults in CHIKV -endemic areas, including those with serologic evidence of 
previous CHIKV exposure. The most frequently reported local  AE was pain/tenderness at the 
injection site reported as mild by 58 of 197 (29%) vaccine recipients who received at least 
one study injection and as moderate by 3/197 vaccine recipients (2.0%). The most frequently 
reported systemic AEs were mild or modera te headache reported by 54 of 197 (27.4%) 
vaccine recipients, malaise (53/197, 26.9%), and myalgia (46/197, 23.4%) (15, 16). Placebo 
recipients reported these systemic reactogenicity symptoms at similar frequencies. One 
vaccine recipient (0.5%) experienced a headache graded as severe following the second 
vaccination. A total of 1 6 SAEs in 15 (3.8%) participants were reported, all were assessed as 
unrelated to the IP ( ie, CHIKV VLP or placebo). All potentially related AEs resolved without 
clinical sequelae (15, 16). 
Taken together, the findings from VRC 311 and VRC 704 suggest that 
VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP is well -tolerated and immunogenic in both CHIKV -exposed  and 
CHIKV -naïve adults.  
1.4.3 Clinical Study PXVX -CV-317-001 
The sponsor’s phase 2 clinical study (PXVX -CV-317-001) conducted in the US compared 
multiple dose and dosing regimens of CHIKV VLP in healthy adults 18 to <46 years  of age  
(17). The dosages of CHIKV VLP ranged from 6 µg to 40 µg, adjuvanted  or unadjuvanted . 
These doses were below or approximately equivalent to those used in the NIH’s VRC 311 
and VRC 704 clinical s tudies using the non -adjuvanted CHIKV VLP (VRC -CHKVLP059 -
00-VP) vaccine. PXVX0317 vaccine was immunogenic across all dose groups as measured 
by human SNA assay. Immunogenicity data reported as 80% antibody neutralization titer 
(NT 80) values supported the b enefit of adjuvant was evident after one dose but not two doses. 
There was a clear dose -response relationship in GMT. Participants receiving 20 µg on the 
standard schedule (Days 1 and 29), either unadjuvanted (as the NIH reference dose) or 
adjuvanted, had the highest Day 57 GMT at 1946 and 1884 respectively, similar to those of 
CHIKV VLP recipients in the VRC 704 study. Participants receiving the single 40 µg dose 
demonstrated only slightly lower GMT levels (1712 at Day 57, ie, 28 days after vaccination); 
all other dose groups demonstrated a GMT range of 914 to 1613 at Day 57. Seroconversion 
rates (titer ≥15) showed that with a single dose administered, up to 98% of study participants 
produced a neutralizing antibody response by Day 8. Further, the immune re sponse was 
shown to be persistent through the 24-month visit, including in the one dose 40  µg CHIKV 
VLP regimen. There was a clear dose -response relationship in GMT, with the Group 8 40 µg 
CHIKV VLP + 300 µg alum adjuvant single dose resulting in 86% seror esponse (titers ≥40) 
7 days post  vaccination as well as the highest GMTs at Day 182. Seroresponse was well 
maintained at 760 days in Group 8 participants . Based on these data the 40  µg CHIKV VLP 
+ 300 µg alum adjuvant single dose regimen was selected going  forward in the PXVX0317 
clinical development.

 1.4.4 Clinical Study EBSI -CV-317-002 
The phase 2 clinical study ( EBSI -CV-317-002) conducted at two sites in the US compared  
the safety and immunogenicity of a 40 µg CHIKV VLP + 300 µg alum adjuvant single dose  
in prior recipients of other alphavirus vaccines vs alphavirus vaccine -naïve controls ( 19).  
The 30 prior alphavirus vaccine recipients and 30 gender and age -matche d vaccine -naïve 
controls were vaccinated and followed for six months. There were no differences between the 
groups in CHIKV neutralizing antibody GMTs at Day 22 and no new safety signals were 
identified.  
For more information refer to the IB.  
1.5 Seroresponse Rate  
In historical studies, a human SNA assay threshold titer of  ≥40 was used, however after  
additional analysis of protective efficacy data from animal studies  and discussions with 
regulatory agencies, an anti-CHIKV SNA titer  (seroresponse rate, als o considered  the 
presumptive seroprotection rate) will be used in the present and future studies.  
1.6 Rationale for Dosage and Route of Administration  
The regimen of PXVX0317 selected for this study is 40 µg of CHIKV VLP with alum 
adjuvant administered in a s ingle IM dose on Day 1. The alum dose of 300 µg is within the 
range of doses of alum adjuvants used in many licensed vaccines, including VLP -based 
vaccines. This dose also creates a concentration ratio to PXVX0317 that achieves high 
(~90%) levels of adsorp tion, thought to enhance immunogenicity. The IM route of 
administration is consistent with that in previous clinical studies (VRC 311, VRC 704, 
PXVX -CV-317-001, and EBSI -CV-317-002). This regimen was selected by an interim 
analysis of the PXVX -CV-317-001 s tudy data. All regimens tested were given to groups of 
50 to 53 healthy adults and all resulted in 100% seroconversion by Day 57. The group 
receiving a single dose of 40 µg plus alum showed the highest CHIKV SNA GMT at Day 
182 and Day 365. Similar findings  were observed i n EBSI -CV-317-002. 
The PXVX0317 vaccine (40 µg CHIKV VLP + 300 µg alum inum hydroxide  adjuvant) single 
dose was selected for further development by the sponsor in  this phase 3 clinical study 
(EBSI -CV-317-005). 
1.7 Population to be Studied  
The target population is adults ≥65 years of age.  This study will generate safety and 
immunogenicity data in elderly adults, in whom PXVX0317 has not been previously 
evaluated. This study is important due to the high relative disease burden in older adults, as  
well as potential concerns about immunosenescence and attendant hyporesponsiveness to 
vaccination in this age group.

 1.8 Summary of Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
1.8.1 Risks Related to Study Intervention  
The injection of PXVX0317, like other injections, ca n cause pain, redness, or swelling at the 
injection site. These types of reactions are generally mild. Less commonly, it can cause 
itching, bruising, or infection.  
Most solicited AEs reported by participant s enrolled in study PXVX -CV-317-001 were mild 
to moderate in severity. The percentage of participant s who reported ≥Grade 3 AEs for the 
following categories were as follows: any AEs (7.9%), any solicited AE (6.1%), any 
systemic solicited AE (5.9%), any local solicited AE (0.2%), any unsolicited AE through  
Day 57 (2.9%), any treatment -related solicited AE (3.6%), any treatment -related systemic 
solicited AE (3.4%), any treatment -related local solicited AE (0.2%). There were no reports 
of ≥Grade 3 treatment -related unsolicited AEs through Day 57. No participant s had a 
treatment -related SAE, and no participant s permanently discontinued study due to AE or died 
during the study.  
Among participant s from PXVX -CV-317-001 Group 8 (n=50) participant s who received the 
40 µg adjuvanted dose selected for furthe r development, 48.0% reported solicited AEs 
occurring within seven  days postvaccination with active vaccine at Day 29. Approximately 
22% of participant s reported solicited  systemic AEs and 40.0% reported solicited local AEs. 
Solicited local  AEs reported in cluded only injection site pai n; no injection site redness or  
swelling was reported after receipt of the active dose. Solicited systemic AEs reported 
included malaise (4.0%), fatigue (4.0%), headache (8.0%), myalgia (12.0%), nausea  (4.0%) , 
and joint pain ( 2.0%).  
There were 13 unrelated SAEs reported for 10 participant s in study PXVX -CV-317-001 and 
study EBSI -CV317 -002. One case of anaphylaxis occurred on study Day 309 in a participant  
that was suspected to be due to a nut allergy. No participant s had a treatment -related SAE, 
and no participant s permanently discontinued study due to AE or died during the study.  
1.8.2 Risk of Allergic Reaction  
With any vaccine, there is a risk of severe allergic reaction. Although such reactions have not 
been reported as related to this vaccine, they have occurred with other vaccines containing 
some of the same ingredients. Symptoms of allergic reaction may include , but are not limited 
to, rash, wheezing and difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, dizziness and fai nting, 
swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes, a fast pulse, and/or sweating. Participants  will be 
directed to inform study staff immediately if experiencing any of these symptoms.  
1.8.3 Risks with Blood Draws  
Blood drawing may cause pain, bruising, feeling f aint, fainting, needle site infections, 
swelling, and rarely other infections. Bruising at the site of blood drawing can be prevented

 by applying pressure for several minutes. To reduce the risk of infection, the area will be 
wiped clean with alcohol and s terile equipment  will be used. 
1.8.3.1  Risks of Positive Screening Test for HIV, Hepatitis B , and Hepatitis C 
At the Screening Visit, participant s will be tested for HBV , HCV , and HIV. Receiving 
information that any health screening tests are abnormal or that tests for HIV and HBV or 
HCV are positive may upset participant s. The study doctors will discuss their health results 
face-to-face (and notify their primary doctor at thei r request). Counseling will be available to 
the study participant  if they wish. A positive HIV status could limit a participant ’s ability to 
obtain future life and health insurance. In rare circumstances, a positive HIV test has led to 
discrimination in em ployment and housing, etc. Participant s will be advised of this in the  
ICF. 
1.8.4 Risks to Pregnancy  
PXVX0317 has not been thoroughly evaluated for potential risks to unborn or nursing 
children.  
1.8.5 Risks to Confidentiality  
Efforts will be made to keep participants’  personal health information confidential. To 
maintain confidentiality, paper study records will be stored in a secure location such as a 
locked office or locked cabinet. Electronic data will be password  protected. Electronic study 
records and samples take n will be coded with a number, not the participants’ names. Records 
will only be shared with authorized personnel and only in connection with carrying out the 
obligations relat ed to the study.  
Although efforts are made to protect the research study records , there is always a risk that 
someone could get access to the personal information in research records or other 
information researchers have stored about participants . 
1.8.6 Benefits  
There is no expected benefit to participant s from this study. A potential benef it of 
participation in this clinical trial might be protection against  CHIKV  disease ; however , the 
clinical efficacy of this vaccine for that indication has not yet been proven. This study will 
accumulate additional safety data on this vaccine and uniquely provide a first glimpse at the 
safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in the context of el derly adults. This data will be 
important to the design of field studies. If, for example, the vaccine is less immunogenic in 
the elderly, this should be considered for determining any potential modified dosing/dose 
regimen recommendations.

 1.9 Hypothesis  
The study hypothesis being tested is that the  immune response to PXVX0317 is superior to 
that of placebo  in adults ≥65 years of age  at Day 22 , that the immune response to PXVX0317 
in adults ≥65 years of age  at Day 22 is clinically relevant , and that the safety  profile in adults 
≥65 years of age  is comparable  to that in individuals 1 8 to <65 years of age . A clinically 
relevant immune response in adults ≥65 years of age is defined as the lower bound  of the 
two-sided 95% CI for the Day 22 seroresponse rate . 
Note:  Seroresponse rate (considered the presumptive seroprotection rate) is defined as the 
percentage of participants who achieve an anti -CHIK SNA titer .

 3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Study Description  
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study with 
two treatment groups.  
At least 400  health y US elderly participants ≥65 years of age an d older  will be enrolled , 
stratified in two age subgroups (≥65 to <75 and ≥75 years of age ). Participants will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single IM dose of PXVX0317 or placebo at Day 
1, respectively.  
The per participant estimated total study  duration is 212 days (including screening) . The 
screening window will be no greater than 30 days prior to Day 1 (randomization and 
administration of IP). The immune response to PXVX0317 will be measured by anti-CHIKV 
SNA up to the Day 183  End of Study Vis it. For details on schedule of events, refer to Table 1 
An independent SMC will provide safety oversight. The SMC will review aggregated, 
blinded safety data after the first 50 participant s have completed seven  days of safety 
follow -up. The remaining participant s will be enrolled following the safety review by the 
SMC and based on the sponsor’s consideration of the SMC’s recommendation.  The need for 
any further reviews will be determined by the SMC.

3.2.8 Acute Observation After Investigational Product  Administration  
The participant  will be monitored by study staff for signs of an acute adverse reaction for at 
least 30 minutes after injection and vital signs will be obtained  30 minutes to one hour after 
vaccination . 
3.2.9 Assess Solicited Adverse Events  
Electronic or p aper diar ies (memory a ids) will be used to collect solicited AEs following 
vaccination. Participants  will record events in their  diary daily, for at least seven days after 
vaccination.  Solicited AEs to be assessed in this study are local events of pain, redness, and 
swelling at  the injection site and systemic events of oral temperature ≥38 .0°C (≥100.4°F), 
chills, fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea .  
Participants will be trained to complete a  diary (electronic or paper) to observe, measure, and 
record these solici ted AEs  daily . A digital thermometer will be provided to the participants to 
measure their temperature each day. The highest temperature measured each day should be 
recorded in the participant ’s diary  or memory aid  (electronic or paper). To record injectio n 
site local reactions, a ruler will be provided to the participant to measure and record the 
diameter of redness and swelling at the largest point of the reaction each day.   
Study staff will review the signs and symptoms recorded in the diary or memory aid  
(electronic or paper)  daily  and will follow -up with parti cipants if any data is missing . The 
investigator will then assess all solicited AEs for sever ity (Section 8.1.8 ) and the action 
taken, and causality (Section 8.1.9 ). The results of the investigator’s assessment will be 
recorded as a separate source document an d will be entered on the solicited AE eCRF.

 Safety Endpoints  
• Incidence of solicited AEs through Day 8  for PXVX0317 and placebo.  
• Incidence of unsolicited AEs through Day 29  for PXVX0317 and placebo.  
• Incidence of SAEs, MAAEs, and AESI through Day 183 for PXVX0317 and placebo . 
3.3.2 Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints  
• Key Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints: Difference in anti -CHIKV SNA 
seroresponse rate (PXVX0317 minus placebo) with associated 95% CIs  at Day 15  and 
Day 183, in that order (see Section 9.6.2 ). 
• Anti-CHIKV SNA GMTs by study arm with associated 95% CIs at Day 15 and Day 183.   
• Geometric mean fold incr ease from Day 1 to subsequent collection time points.  
• Number and percentage of participants  with an anti -CHIKV SNA titer ≥15 and 4 -fold

Geometric mean titers  and associated two -sided 95% CIs for neutralizing antibodies against 
various  CHIKV genotypes measured at Day 22 (and at baseline if necessary)  for a subset of 
participants  in the PXVX0317 group . 
3.4 Measures Taken to Minimize/Avoid Bias  
3.4.1 Masking/Blinding Proce dures  
Study participants , the investigator, and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the study. Sponsor’s MM and personnel, who are in 
regular contact with the study site and/or involved with documentation as sociated with the 
study will remain blinded to all participant randomization assignments.  
The following safeguards will be employed to reduce the risk of inadvertent unblinding:  
• Use of a standardized pre -filled syringe and injection volume for all injections.  
• All PXVX0317 and placebo syringes have a semi -transparent barrel cover to mask 
any difference in appearance between placebo and PXVX0317.  
• No sponsor personnel will have access to the randomization schedule. No site 
personnel will have access to  treatment assignments. The Randomization and Trial 
Supply Management (RTSM) system allows for unblinding in an emergency (see 
Section 3.4.1.1 ).

Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 37 of 78 
 
 • Assays will be run in a blinded manner. The assay titer results will not be delivered to 
the sponsor data management and analysis team s until after database lock, as they are 
potentially unblinding.  
• Should any participant or staff member become inadverten tly unblinded, the 
investigator will promptly (within 24 hours of their awareness of the error) disclose 
the event to the sponsor’s M M in a blinded fashion (disclosing only participant 
number, not treatment) so that corrective action can be initiated. The unblinding 
sequence of events will be documented and retained as source documents. A protocol 
deviation will be entered in the eCRF.  
Members of the SMC  may have access to unblinded data as defined in the SMC Charter  for 
safety/other  data review.   
Under ce rtain circumstances (eg , safety reasons, required reporting to regulatory agencies), 
unblinding of IP for a particular participant will be allowed. This s afety unblinding will be 
documented as a protocol deviation. Otherwise, unblinding of the study will o nly occur after 
the clinical database has been locked.  
Refer to the  Pharmacy Manual  for procedures in case of accidental unblinding of 
study -affiliated personnel.   
3.4.1.1  Breaking the Blind for Individual Participant s 
If the PI determines that knowledge of a participant ’s treatment assignment is urgently 
needed to guide treatment or ensure the participant ’s safety, the PI may perform emergency 
unblinding via the RTSM system. The PI must attempt to notify the sponsor MM prior to 
unblinding and must notify the sponsor  MM within 24 hours after unblinding at the latest . 
If a participant ’s study treatment assignment is unblinded for safety reasons, or if a 
participant  becomes accidentally unblinded for any reason, the participant  will be requested 
to remain in the s tudy for safety follow -up.  
Documentation of breaking the blind must be entered in the study participants’ source 
documents with the following information recorded: (i) date and time the blind was broken; 
(ii) the rationale behind the unblinding decision/o ccurrence; ( iii) the names of the personnel 
involved; and ( iv) date of contact with the sponsor  MM(s). The unblinding will be 
documented as a protocol deviation.  
3.4.2 Treatment Assignment/Randomization  
Participant  eligibility will be confirmed and documented by  the investigator immediately 
prior to randomization of each participant  on Day 1 . Study staff will indicate on a 
randomization eCRF within the EDC system that they want to generate a randomization 
number for the participant . When they agree to proceed, a randomization number will be 
generated from the EDC randomization module but hidden from study staff. The EDC 
randomization module will match the randomization number to an IP kit available at the site 
PXVX0317    
Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 38 of 78 
 
 and inform the study s taff of the assigned kit. Study staff will use the appropriate kit for 
planned administration to the participant . 
Participant s will be considered enrolled once a randomization number has been assigned 
within the EDC system. Participant s will be stratified by age subgroups (65 to <75 years and 
≥75 years of age), with a target of 25% enrollment of participant s ≥75 years of age. 
Participant s will be randomized to PXVX0317 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.  
The study will be conducted as a double -blind study through Da y 183 End of Study Visit. 
Neither participant s nor clinical site personnel, including the P I, nor the sponsor will know 
participant s' individual treatment assignments until all participant s have either prematurely 
discontinued or completed their participat ion in the study through the Day 183 End of Study 
Visit and the database has been cleaned and locked.  
3.5 Description of Stopping Rules  
There are no specific predefined  stopping rules for this study ; however , an independent SMC 
will provide safety oversight. The SMC will review aggregated, blinded safety data after the 
first 50 participant s have completed seven  days of safety follow -up. The remaining 
participant s will be enrolled following the safety review by t he SMC and based on the 
sponsor’s consideration of the SMC’s recommendation.  The need for any further reviews 
will be determined by the SMC.  
3.6 Accountability Procedures  
The PI (or designee) is responsible for maintaining accurate inventory records of the IP and 
placebo.  
3.7 Maintenance of Study Intervention Randomization  
Please see Section 3.4. 
3.8 Data Directly Recorded on the Electronic Case Report Form  
Data recorded directly from the e -Diary will be considered source data.  
3.9 End of Study  
A participant is considered to have completed this study if he/she has been dosed with IP and 
completed the final planned study visit at Day 183. Participants who do not complete the Day 
183 vis it are considered to have been withdrawn from the study . For participants that 
terminate early, efforts should be made to conduct an E DV. 
The End of Study Date is defined as the date of the participant’s last study visit on Day 183 
or EDV.

 3.9.1 Terminating the Study  
The sponsor reserves the right to stop or terminate the study at any time for clinical or 
administrative reasons.  
Any decision to voluntarily suspend or terminate a clinical study will be carefully reviewed 
and fully justified. The sponsor will noti fy the applicable regulatory authority  of any 
suspension or termination, along with justification for terminating the study.  
The sponsor  will notify the  investigators,  FDA , and central institutional review board ( IRB) 
of study’s completion or early ter mination . The investigators  will notify  local IRBs in writing 
of the study’s completion or early termination. The sponsor must receive a copy of the 
notification letter from the IRB indicating receipt of the completion or early termination 
letter.  
3.9.2 Terminating  the Study at an Individual Investigational Site 
An investigational site may be terminated from the study at the discretion of the  sponsor  or 
IRB for reasons such as noncompliance, lack of recruitment, fraud or blacklisting  by the 
regulatory authorities , relocation of the investigator , etc.  
The sponsor may decide to replace a terminated investigational site.

the allowed screening window, rescreening will be required.  
4.3 Participant Withdrawal Criteria  
The participants must be available, without coercion, for all parts of the study.  If continued 
participation jeopardizes the participant’s health, the participant should be withdrawn from 
the study. The investigator is encouraged to consult the sponsor prior to the withdrawal of 
any participant , except in the event of a medical emergenc y. The reason for withdrawal of 
any participant must be clearly documented on the study  source documents and the 
appropriate eCRF.  
All participants have the right to withdraw at any time during the study without prejudice.  
4.3.1 Withdrawal  of Consent  
All partici pants are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any 
reason, specified or unspecified, and without penalty  or loss of benefits to which the

 4.3.2 Investigator -based Participant  Withdrawal  
The investigator may withdraw a participant from further participation in the study, at their 
discretion, if medically necessary or for reasons of noncompliance. The reason for 
withdrawal of any participant must be clearly documented  on the study source documents 
and the appropriate eCRF. The investigator is encouraged to consult the sponsor prior to the 
withdrawal of any participant , except in the event of a medical emergency.  
The investigator (and/or sponsor) may withdraw a partici pant from the study for any of, but 
not limited to, the following reasons:  
• Noncompliance with the protocol. If the participant is noncompliant with protocol 
requirement, the issue should be discussed with the participant and, if not resolved, 
consideration  given to withdrawing the participant . 
• Lost to follow -up (LTF) ; requires documentation of at least three unsuccessful 
attempts to contact participants , one of which must be a registered letter.  Lost to 
follow -up will be determined after the date of the participant’s projected last visit.  
Study disposition date will be the last date of contact with the participant prior to 
LTF.  
• Other reason(s) which, in the opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued 
participation in the study is not in the best in terest of the participant .  
Safety follow -up for AEs should occur for all participant s. For information on safety 
follow -up for withdrawn participants see Section 4.3.3 . 
Reasons for withdrawal of individual participants from the study prior to the final protocol 
required visit and/or final safety follow -up are to be recorded on the eCRF  and participant 
source  documents.  
4.3.3 Follow -up for Withdrawn Participants  
Outreach will be made to ensure that participant s who are withd rawn , or who withdraw from 
the study, during the active observation or follow -up period will complete all safety and 
available assessments for t he EDV as outlined in this protocol. The investigator should 
inform the participant  that these assessments are for their own well -being and, if possible, for 
study purposes. The participant must first agree to the collection of early withdrawal and 
safety assessments prior to the assessments, and this agreement must be documented in the 
source documents.  Additional information regarding ongoing AEs may be provided as a 
follow -up report.  
4.3.4 Participant Replacement    
Participant s withdrawn from the study or who withdraw consent prior to or after  dosing will 
not be replaced. Data from participant s withdrawn from the study or who withdraw consent

5 STUDY INTERVENTION  
5.1 Investigational Products  
5.1.1 PXVX0317 Vaccine  
The PXVX0317 vaccine is comprised of CHIKV VLP adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide  
adjuvant 2%, and formulation buffer supplied as a single dose in a pre -filled glass syringe. 
Chikungunya virus  VLP refers to the virus -like particle component of PXVX0317 produced 
by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells with a DNA expression 
plasmid encoding C and E (E3, E2, 6K, and E1 ) proteins. After expression of the 
plasmid -encoded pro teins, VLPs self -assemble and are released into the cell culture medium 
as ~70 nm particles. The 6K and E3 proteins have not been specifically detected in the VLPs. 
No replication -capable viral genetic material is incorporated into the VLPs. V irus-like 
particles  are then concentrated from the cell supernatant purified, and buffer exchanged. The 
VLPs are then formulated with excipients and aluminum hydroxide  adjuvant, mixed, and 
filled into 1 mL glass syringes with a 0.8 5 mL fill volume to allow for 0.8 mL of deliverable 
volume. The glass syringe is sealed with a rubber closure and plastic cap. The rubber closure 
does not contain natural latex.   
See the Pharmacy Manual and the IB for additional information, including composition of 
PXVX0317 vaccine.   
5.1.2 Placebo  Pre-filled Syringe  
The placebo is a sterile aqueous solution with the same excipient composition as the drug 
product without CHIKV VLP and aluminum hydroxide  adjuvant. The placebo is filled into 
PXVX0317    
Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 44 of 78 
 
 1 mL glass syringes with a 0. 85 mL fill volume to allow for 0.8 mL of deliverable volume . 
The placebo is stored at 2 .0 to 8.0°C. The glass syringe is sealed with a rubber closure and 
plastic cap. The rubber closure does not contain natural latex.  
See the Pharmacy Manual for additional information, including composi tion of the placebo.   
5.1.3 Packaging and Labeling  
Investigational product  (PXVX0317 and placebo ) will be shipped in kits containing labelled 
pre-filled syringes. Kits and syringes will be labelled with the following information:  
• “Caution: New Drug – Limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use Only”  
• Investigational product name – PXVX0317 or placebo (to maintain the blind both 
names will be inclu ded) 
• Dose volume and container – single dose of 0.8 mL in pre -filled single -dose syringe  
• Route of administration – IM 
• Randomization kit number (in lieu of lot numbers and manufacture date and/or expiry 
date to maintain the blind)  
• Protocol number – EBSI -CV-317-005 
• Recommended storage tempe rature/conditions – stored refrigerated at 2 .0 to 8.0°C 
• Sponsor – Emergent Travel Health Inc.  
5.1.4 Storage Conditions  
Investigational product  syringes  must be stored  at 2.0 to 8.0°C in a secured area until ready 
for use. The temperature in the storage area must be monitored by checking and recording 
current, maximum/minimum temperature readi ngs inside the vaccine storage unit once daily . 
Any excursions must be promptly reported to the sponsor; product should be quarantined by 
the site and may be released for use by the sponsor only after investigation and confirmation 
of continued stability. Accountability will be maintained in accordance with GCP to include 
dates on which IP kit was received, administered to participants , returned to the sponsor , or 
destroyed at the site . The study monitors will periodically check supplies held at the clinical 
sites to verify accountability. Templates for accountability records are included in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
The investigator will only approve administration of the IP to participants enrolled in this 
study according to the procedures described in t his protocol. At the end of the study all 
unused IP and containers will either be destroyed on site with appropriate documentation or 
returned to the sponsor.

 5.1.5 Preparation  
Investigational product (PXVX0317  vaccine and placebo) will be supplied as a single d ose of 
0.8 mL in a pre-filled single -dose syringe  shipped in kits .  
5.1.6 Investigational Product Preparation  
On Day 1 before IP administration, the interim medical history (ie, from Screening Visit to 
Day 1) will be reviewed and updated in the participant  file, a targeted physical  exam may be 
performed , and blood samples will be collected . Immediately prior to IP administration, staff 
will verify that the participant  is still eligible  and randomize the participant in the EDC  
(Section 3.4.2 ). Once these procedures are performed and if the participant  is still eligible , IP 
will be administered.  
All doses of IP are 0.8 mL in volume and are administered by IM injection in the deltoid 
muscle with a 1 mL syringe and 25 gauge 1” (or 1.5”, at the investigator’s discretion) needle 
using universal precautions and sterile technique ; see Table 2 for more details . 
Investigational product is to be administered only under the direct supervision of the PI or a 
qualified subinvestigator identified on the FDA Form 1572.  The injection will be 
administered into the deltoid muscle by a staff member delega ted by the investigator. Right 
or left  deltoid  muscle  may be  used at the discretion of the administering staff member with 
consideration for participant preference and features that may obscure interpretation of any 
local AEs such as tattoos, scars , or oth er lesions.  
For further details see the Pharmacy Manual.  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate inventory records of IP (PXVX0317 
or placebo). The investigator or design ee will inventory all I P kit shipments upon receipt, 
acknowledge poss ession by signing all required documentation, and returning these to the 
sponsor. The investigator must ensure that all drug supplies are kept in a secure location in 
the site pharmacy in accordance with recommended storage conditions. Inventory and 
ongoin g record of test material supplies using the Drug Accountability Form provided within 
the Clinical Trial Material Tracking Module of the sponsor ’s RTSM system . This inventory 
record for the IP will include:  
• Protocol name, number , and sponsor  
• Kit number  
• Study site and investigator name  
• Use-by/Expiry/Retest date  
• Name and title of qualified individual administering IP. 
These records will be reviewed by representatives of the sponsor and may be reviewed by 
regulatory agencies.

instructions . 
5.2 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
At the Screening Visit, the details of prior and concomitant medication s taken within  30 days 
of the Screening Visit (or within 90 days  for blood products , or within six months for 
immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory medications)  will be collected . Concomitant 
medications will be collected at each onsite study visit or by phone interview (or EDV ) for 
all groups . The details of all concomit ant medications including those associated with 
solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs through Day 29  will be collected . Concomitant 
medications associated with SAE s, MAAEs,  and/or AESI  will be collected through the end 
of the study.  
5.2.1 Prohibited and/or Restricte d Medications  
The history of all prohibited medications used at any time during study participation 
(regardless of association with an AE) will be collected. The sponsor  MM should be 
consulted for any questions about prohibited or restricted medication usa ge. 
Participants must not have received or be planning to receive:  
• Systemic immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications from six months prior 
to screening through Day 22 .   
• Systemic  corticosteroid  use at a dose or equivalent dose of 20  mg of prednisone or more

All participants will be administered the IP by qualified site study staff. Compliance with the 
study protocol and procedures will be monitor ed on an ongoing basis by study staff.  
6 STUDY PROCEDURES AND  ASSESSMENTS PER VIS IT 
6.1 Screening  (Visit 1, within 30 days of Day 1)  
Within 30 days prior to Day 1 of IP administration , eligible participants will first undergo 
informed consent counseling. Once written  informed consent has been obtained, participants 
will undergo a screening visit to ascertain their eligibility in this study.  The screening visit 
assessments will include:  
• Informed consent  (Section 12.1). 
• Review of eligibility criteria  (Section 3.2.1 ). 
• Medical history including demographics  (Section 3.2.2 ). 
• Prior and current medication s (Section 5.2).  
• Vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature  (Section 3.2.4 ). 
• Complete physical exam ination  including height and weight  (general appearance, eyes -
ears-nose-throat, head -neck, lungs -chest, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, lymph nodes, 
skin, extremitie s, and neurological assessment ) (Section 3.2.3 ). 
• Blood collection for laboratory testing for HIV, HBV, and HCV  (Section 3.2.5 ). 
Each participant who signs the ICF will receive a sequential identification (ID) number 
unique to the site number and the participant . When screening information is e ntered into the 
EDC system a participant will be assigned a participant ID number with the following 
format: 4 -digit site number and 4 -digit ID number, eg, 1111 -1111. Participant numbers will 
be sequential since screen failed participants will be entered i nto the  EDC system. Each site 
will maintain a screening enrollment log to record the enrollment or the reason(s) for screen 
failure for all participants who receive a participant ID number. Reason for screen failure will 
also be captured in the EDC disposi tion eCRF. Screening procedures are listed in the 
schedule of events ( Table 1). 
6.2 Rescreening  
Rescreening may occur given the following circumstances:  
• If the participant has an acute febrile illness at the time of their scheduled enrollment, 
they may be rescreened 14 days after resolution of their acute illness.  
• If the participant tests positive for COVID -19 (using any type of test, even if 
asymptomatic)  the participant can be rescreened after 14 days or after a negative

 molecular test , eg, PCR, if outside of the initial screening window  (within 30 days of 
Day 1) . 
• Participants who have received vaccines within 30 days of Day 1 may be rescreened 
provided n o additional doses are anticipated up to Day 22.  
• Participants who have received blood products or IP from participation in another 
clinical study that has ended may be rescreened after the appropriate duration has 
passed (90 days for blood products; 30 day s for IP ; six months prior to screening for 
systemic immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications ). 
• Eligible participants  who are not able to be vaccinated within 30 days of their 
screening period may be rescreened.  
Any other request for rescreening s hould be discussed with the sponsor MM.  
Rescreening  will involve undergoing all screening procedures again, including reconsenting 
and use of the same participant  ID number. Participants  may be rescreened one time only. 
Rescreening is not otherwise permitt ed.

 6.7 Early Discontinuation  Visit  
For EDV  occurring within seven  days postvaccination, from seven  to 21 days 
postvaccination, or ≥22 days postvaccination, the Visit 3, Visit 4 , or Visit 7 schedule will be 
followed , respec tively .  
7 ASSESSMENT OF IMMUNOGENICITY   
7.1 Anti-CHIKV SNA  Analysis  
The immune response to PXVX0317 will be measured by anti-CHIKV  SNA analysis, for 
which serum samples will be collected on Day 1 predose, Day 15, Day 22, and Day 183  End 
of Study Visit (or at E DV). 
The immunogenicity analysis will be performed using the validated human SNA assay, a 
high-throughput in vitro  infectivity assay developed by the sponsor for assessing titers of 
neutralizing antibodies  against CHIKV in serum samples. The induction of t he humoral 
immune response (immunogenicity) by PXVX0317 vaccine, specifically anti-CHIKV SNA 
levels, will be measured by a bioluminescence assay that uses a modified version of CHIKV 
containing a reporter gene that expresses a luciferase protein (CHIKV -luc) in infected Vero 
cells in vitro . Reduction of luciferase activity ( ie, reduced bioluminescence) occurs in 
infected cultures of cells following treatment of CHIKV -luc with test serum containing 
anti-CHIKV SNA. The quantitation of reporter gene expression,  a correlate of the level of 
virus infection of cells, is determined by detection of luciferase using a micro -plate 
luminometer. The anti-CHIKV SNA tite r 80 (NT 80) is the reciprocal of the serum dilution 
that provides 80% protection of Vero cells from CHIK V-luc infection , or an 80% reduction 
of luciferase activity compared to virus only control.  
7.2 Cross -reactive Neutralizing Antibodies to Various CHIKV Genotypes  
Cross -reactive neutralizing antibodies to various CHIKV  genotypes  will be measured using 
FRNT 50, as an exploratory objective . Foci from infected cells are enumerated following 
exposure to mixtures of virus and immune serum. The foci are identified by examining 
stained cells with antiviral antibodies and detected with a colorimetric substrate to hors e 
radish peroxidase. Reduction of stained foci are quantitated using a plate reader and 
neutralizing data analyzed using GraphPad prism analysis software. Anti-CHIKV  
neutralization antibody titer is the reciprocal of the antibody dilution that protects a 
percentage of cells from infection compared to virus only control.

 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS A ND REPORTING  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant  
administered a medicinal  product and th at does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigat ional) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
Note s:  
• A diagnosis should be captured as an AE term and signs and  symptoms should be 
captured only in the absence of a unifying diagnosis. If a diagnosis is ultimately 
made, it should replace the previous report based on signs and symptoms.  
• In the event that there are multiple diagnoses, then all diagnoses should be captured.  
• The worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease is also con sidered to be an 
AE.  
• An abnormal laboratory finding deemed by the PI (or designee ) as not clinically 
significant will not be captured as an AE, but an abnormal laboratory finding that 
worsens after dosing with the IP, from not clinically significant to cl inically 
significant, is considered an AE.  
• Surgical procedures are not AEs. They are the action taken to treat a medical 
condition. The medical condition that was treated with surgery may be the AE 
depending on whether  it occurred prior to IP treatment. Interventions that were 
planned prior to study entry for medical conditions that started prior to study entry 
but did not worsen during the clinical study are not reported as AEs.  
• Medically attended adverse events:  medically attended visits include hospita l, ER, 
urgent care clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel  for any reason . 
Routine scheduled study visits will not be considered medically attended visits.  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: results in death,  is life threatening, 
requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions , or is a congenital a nomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events which may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a n SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
PXVX0317    
Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 52 of 78 
 
 they may jeopardize the patient or participant  and may requ ire medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Note s:  
• Death is an outcome and not an event. The condition leading to death is the event. If 
no other information regarding the cause of death is available, the  event will be 
considered “Unspecified Adverse Event” /Death not otherwise specifi ed (Death NOS) .  
• Overnight stays at hospital/clinic that occurs during a trial for social reasons (eg, 
transportation difficulties, respite care) is not considered to be a hos pitalization 
event.  
8.1.3 Adverse Drug Reaction  
A response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended. Response in this context 
means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a 
reasonable possibility.   
8.1.4 Suspected U nexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is a serious , unexpected AE that 
is suspected of being related to the IP and occurring during the clinical study.    
8.1.5 Adverse Event s of Special Interest  
An AESI  is a not eworthy event for the particular product or class of products that a sponsor 
may wish to monitor carefully. It could be serious or nonserious and could include events 
that might be potential precursors or prodromes for more serious medical conditions in 
susceptible individuals.  
In this study, n ew onset or worsening arthralgia that is medically attended will be included as 
an AESI. The occurrence of new onset or worsening arthralgia that is medically attended will 
be monitored throughout the study for all participants . Medically attended visits include 
hospital, ER, urgent care clinic, or other visits to or from medical personnel . Routine 
scheduled study visits will not be considered medically attended visits.  
8.1.6 Solicited Adverse Event    
A solicited AE is a protocol -specified AE about which the investigator (or designee) 
proactively asks the participants during a protocol -specified time period. Solicited AEs to be 
assessed for this study are local injection site events of pain, redness, and swelling a t the 
injection site and systemic events of fever with oral temperature ≥ 38.0°C (≥100.4 °F; if more 
than one temperature reading is taken, the highest reading obtained each day should be 
recorded ), fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and nausea.

Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 53 of 78 
 
 Solicited AEs will be recorded by the participant s using a diary (electronic or paper) for 
seven days  postvaccination .    
8.1.7 Unsolicited Adverse Event  
An unsolicited AE is an AE that is spontaneously reported by the participant  or discovered 
by the PI. 
8.1.8 Severity of Adverse Events  
The investigator will grade all AEs for severity. For the study Grading Scale see Appendix I .  
Adverse events not listed in the Grading Scale will be graded as follows:  
• Mild (Grade 1) – No interference with activity  
• Moderate (Grade 2) – Some interference with activity  
• Severe (Grade 3) – Significant; prevents daily activity  
• Potentially Life -Threatening  (Grade 4) – as determined at ER visit or 
hospitalization  
• For solicited AEs, the severity of redness and swelling recorded as diameters (mm) will 
be summarized according to categories based on the largest diameter linear measurement 
when the local reaction is present . 
• Events reported as not present (0 mm is entered) will be reported as Grade 0.  
8.1.9 Causality of Adverse Events  
The investigator  is responsible for the assessment of the causality of an AE and the sponsor ’s 
MM will also assess SAE causality, independent of the PI. 
The following g uidelines are provided for this assessment : 
• Unrelated:  No relationship between the IP and the reported event . The event will be 
considered “not related ” to the IP. 
• Possibly related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
administ ration of IP and/or follows a known response pattern to the IP but could also 
have been produced by other factors . 
• Probably related : A reasonable temporal sequence of the event with administration of IP 
exists and based on the known response to the IP, known or previously reported adverse 
reactions to the IP or similar products, or in the PI’s (or design ee) clinical judgment the 
association of the event with the IP seems likely . 
• Definitely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormalit y, occurring in a 
plausible time relationship to IP administration, and which cannot be explained by 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals .

Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 54 of 78 
 
 If the relationship between the AE and the IP is determined to be “possible” “probable ,” or 
“definitely” , the event will be considered to be “related” to the IP.

 8.3 Reporting Requirements for Immediately Reportable Events  
8.3.1 Principal Investigator’s Reporting Requirements  
The following events must be reported w ithin 24 hours of awareness by the PI (or designee ) 
to the sponsor :  
• Any SAE regardless of causal association with the IP.  
• Any AESI regardless of causal association with the IP. 
Applicable events must be entered into the validated EDC system. In the event of a system 
failure, the appropriate  forms  (listed below) will be completed  and sent by email to the 
following address:  
Global Pharmacovigilance Department  
Emergent BioSolutions Inc.  
 
The paper reported SAEs and AESI should be entered in EDC once the system is available.  
For SAEs/AESIs, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Report Form 
will be completed (abbreviated hereafter SAE/AESI Report Form). The SAE/AESI Report 
Form is NOT the same as the AE eCRF. Participant  identifiers (eg, name, address, tel ephone 
number, social security number, medical record number, or hospital/laboratory number) must 
be redacted from the source documentation.  
All SAEs that are unexpected (eg, adverse drug reactions) must be reported to the IRB by the 
PI (or designee ) as r equired by ICH GCP E6 (R2). 
The PI is responsible to notify their IRB according to their policy.  
8.3.2 Sponsor ’s Reporting Requirements  
As specified in 21 CFR 312.32 , SUSARs will be reported by the sponsor of the I P to the 
FDA  and to all participating investigators in an individual case safety report as soon as 
possible, no later than 15 calendar days  after the sponsor becomes aware of the suspected 
adverse reaction (21 CFR 312.32 (c)(1)). In addition, any unexpected fatal or life -threatening 
suspected ad verse reaction will be reported to the FDA  no later than seven  days after the 
sponsor’s initial receipt of the information in accordance with 21 CFR  312.32 (c)(2) . All 
SAEs that are unexpected (e.g., adverse drug reactions) must be reported to the IRB  as 
required by ICH GCP E6 (R2).

 8.4 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs , MAAE s, SAEs , and AESI will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or up to 
30 days after the last study visit.  
8.4.1 Follow -up of Nonserious Adverse Events  
Nonserious AEs that are identi fied from the time IP administration  through the 28 -day 
post-IP administration  period and are still ongoing on the last scheduled visit must be 
recorded on the AE eCRF with the current status noted. All nonserious events that are 
ongoing at this time will be recorded as “Not Recovered/Not Resolved” on the AE eCRF. 
The status of ongoing, previously reported AEs will be subject to active follow -up. 
8.4.2 Follow -up of Serious Adverse Events or Adverse Events of Special Interest  
This study requires that participant s be monitored for SAE/AESI up to Day 183  End of Study 
Visit .  
The PI will provide or arrange appropriate care for participant s for whom SAEs or a potential 
AESI are experienced. Withdrawal of participant s from the study to treat SAEs/AESI is at 
the discretion of the treating PI. See Section 4.3 Participant Withdrawal Criteria . 
All SAEs/AESI will be followed by the PI until at least one of the following conditions is 
met:  
• The SAE/AESI is resolved or stable if expected to remain chronic.  
• The participant is referred to a specialist or other physician for treatment and follow -up. 
The PI (or designee ) will follow the participant’s condition even if the participant is seen 
by another physician, to obtain information about the diagnosis and outcome and any 
treatments and medications administered for the event.  
The following will be considered acceptable reasons for discontinuation of follow -up of 
ongoing SAEs/A ESI: 
• Participant withdraws consent  
• Participant is referred to appropriate long -term medical care  
• Participant is considered LTF 
It is expected that the investigational site will obtain supporting medical records from 
appropriate physicians and record this information on the SAE/AESI Report Form and AE 
eCRF. Additional information received related to any SAE/AESI must be forwarded within 
24 hours of awareness to the Emerg ent Global Pharmacovigilance  Department.  
8.4.3 Follow -up of Pregnancies  
Not applicable, as study population is ≥65  years of age .

 8.4.4 Unanticipated Problems  
For investigational sites in the U S, as outlined by the Office for Human Research Protection, 
unanticipated p roblems must be reported to the IRB according to the requirements of 45 CFR 
Part 46. Unanticipated problems are considered to include any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets ALL  the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or f requency) given:  
• Procedures that are described in the study -related documents, such as the IRB 
approved research protocol and informed consent document.  
• The characteristics of the participant  population being entered into the study.  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the study which means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the sample 
collection.  
• Suggests that the study places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (in cluding 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
An incidence, experience, or outcome that meets the three criteria above generally will 
warrant consideration of substantive changes in the study or informe d consent 
process/document or other corrective actions in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights 
of participant s or others.  
The PI should promptly notify the IRB when an unanticipated problem involving risks to 
participant s or others is identifie d. Also, the PI should notify the sponsor of unanticipated 
problem(s).  
8.5 Safety Data Monitoring  
An independent SMC will provide safety oversight . The SMC will review aggregated, 
blinded safety data after the first 50 participant s have completed at least seven  days of safety 
follow -up. The remaining participant s will be enrolled following the safety review by the 
SMC and based on the sponsor’s consideration of the SMC’s recommendation.  Any further 
safety reviews will be at the discretion of the SMC  and per  the SMC Charter . 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses. The details are described in the 
study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
9.1 Sample Size Rationale  
Based on the data from the phase 2 study (protocol PXV X-CV-317-001), the seroresponse 
rate for PXVX0317 vaccine is expected to be approximately  v s <5% for the placebo 
participant s. With an assumed 10% rate of nonevaluable participant s, the power to show 

PXVX0317    
Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 58 of 78 
 
 superiority over placebo with 180 PXVX0317 vaccine and 180 placebo evaluable 
participant s is >99.9% for the combined age groups.  
The difference in seroresponse rate between PXVX0317 and placebo groups that is 
considered clinically relevant is . With 1 80 baseline seronegative  PXVX0317 -treated 
participant s and a target seroresponse rate of  vs a rate of 5% for placebo, the width of a 
two-sided 95% CI would be ±5.4% . If the target PXVX0317 seroresponse is , the width 
would be ±6.9%. Therefore, the d ifference in seroresponse rates must be above  for the 
lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference to be .  
9.2 Analysis Populations  
Analysis will be based on the following study populations:  
Enrolled  Population : All screened participants who sign an IC F, are entered in the EDC 
database, and meet all eligibility criteria . 
Randomized Population:  All screened participants who provide informed consent and 
provide demographic and other screening measurements and are randomized in the EDC.  
Exposed Population:  All participants in the randomized population who receive IP.  
Safety Population:  All participants in the exposed population who provide safety 
assessment data. Safety endpoints will utilize the safety population, analyzed as treated.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat population:  All randomized participants who are vaccinated and 
have at least one postinjection anti-CHIKV SNA titer result, analyzed as randomized.  
Immunogenicity Evaluable Population:  All participants in the mITT population who: i) 
provide evaluable serum sample results for the Day 22 time point within the required time 
frame of Day 19 through Day 2 7, inclusive, ii) have no measurable anti-CHIKV SNA at Day 
1, iii) have no important protocol deviation or other reason to be excluded a s defined prior to 
unblinding. The IEP is the primary population for all immunogenicity analyses.  
9.3 Statistical Methods  
Tables will be displayed by treatment group (PXVX0317 and placebo) columns  for the 
analysis populations described in Section  9.6. 
Continuous endpoints will be summarized by descriptive statistics including number of 
nonmissing observations (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum , and maximum. In 
the analysis of the human SNA assay data as a continuous variable, anti-CHIKV SNA NT 80 
values will be logarithmically transformed (base 10), and the GMTs and associated 95% CI s 
for each treatment group will be computed by exponentiating the cor responding 
log-transformed means and two -sided 95% CIs. Categorical variables will be summarized by 
frequency counts (n) and percentages of participants (%) in each category, including missing 
or unknown when appropriate.

 9.4 Multiplicity Controls  
9.4.1 Coprimary Immunogenicity Endpoints  
The familywise error rate will be fixed at a two -sided alpha of 0.05 by the requirement that 
both coprimary immunogenicity endpoints must be met for a successful outcome:  
1. Day 22 seroresponse in the IEP across all age groups combine d, including superiority to 
placebo and the success criterion of the lower bound of the two -sided Newcombe hybrid 
score method 95% CI on the difference in seroresponse rates  between PXVX0317 and 
placebo .  
2. Day 22 GMTs significantly different between PXV X0317 and placebo  in the IEP across 
both age groups combined  using an ANOVA model with logarithmically transformed  
anti-CHIKV SNA titers (log 10) as the dependent variable and treatment group and study 
site as the fixed effects  with a two -sided significance  level of 0.05 . 
9.4.2 Key Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints  
A prespecified hierarchical approach will be employed for the key secondary 
immunogenicity endpoint hypothesis testing to preserve the type I error rate without the need 
for further multiplicity adjust ment. If the null hypotheses are rejected for both coprimary 
endpoints, only then will the key secondary endpoints be formally tested in sequential order. 
If a nonsignificant test is reached formal testing will stop, and the remaining endpoints will 
be rep orted for information only. The seroresponse rates and rate differences at Days 15  and 
183 will be tested sequentially in order, each for the IEP across both age groups combined, as 
follows:  
1. Day 15 seroresponse superior to placebo . 
2. Day 183  seroresponse sup erior to placebo.  
After testing the coprimary immunogenicity endpoints and, if both met, the hierarchical key 
secondary immunogenicity endpoints, no other formal hypothesis testing will be carried out. 
The remaining secondary immunogenicity endpoints inclu ding GMTs, GMFI, other titers, 
the exploratory endpoint, and all safety endpoints will be evaluated and reported for 
information only, thus no further multiplicity adjustment is needed.  
9.5 Handling of Missing Data  
Participant s with missing immunogenicity data at Days 15, 22, or 183 will be excluded from 
the corresponding analysis; missing immunogenicity data will not be imputed. Human SNA 
assay anti-CHIKV SNA NT 80 values below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be 
repla ced by LLOQ/2 in the immunogenicity analyses. Imputation rules for partial or missing 
dates and for missing AE relatedness and/or severity  will be described in the study SAP.

 9.6 Planned Analyses  
9.6.1 Study Population Characteristics  
9.6.1.1  Participant Disposition  
Partici pant disposition will be summarized for all screened  participants who sign and date the 
ICF. Randomized participants will be displayed by treatment group, including number and 
percentages of participants still in the study at each scheduled visit, those co mpeting the 
study and reason for not completing the study. Screen failure reasons will be listed by 
participant . The number and percentage of participants enrolled by site will be provided by 
treatment group for all randomized participants . 
Randomization d etails including site, stratum, date and time of randomization, kit number, 
randomized treatment group assignment and actual treatment received will be listed by 
participant . Participants randomized but not treated  and those receiving the wrong treatment 
will be listed. Participants who were randomized despite not meeting entry criteria and those 
who received an excluded concomitant medication will be listed.  
9.6.1.2  Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be categorized as important or not important and evaluated for 
exclusion of participant s from analysis populations  prior to database lock and unblinding . 
Important protocol deviations will be tabulated by category and by treatment group for the 
randomized population as well as listed by participant .

Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 61 of 78 
 
 9.6.1.6  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications and vaccines will be coded to the World Health 
Organization Drug Global Dictionary anatomic therapeutic chemical  (ATC ) classification 
and preferred drug name. All prior and concomitant medications and vaccines will be 
tabulated together by ATC classification, preferred drug name and treatment group for the 
safety population. A participant  data listing of all prior a nd concomitant medications will be 
generated.  
9.6.2 Immunogenicity Analyses  
Summary statistics for immunogenicity results by scheduled visit for each treatment group 
will be provided for the IEP and mITT populations. Chikungunya virus  SNA GMT will be 
tabulated by visit for each treatment group. Chikungunya virus  SNA GMT will also be 
plotted over time for each treatment group for the IEP.  
In the analysis of the human SNA assay data as a continuous variable, anti-CHIKV SNA 
NT 80 values wi ll be logarithmically transformed (base10), and the GMTs and associated 95% 
CI for each treatment group will be computed by exponentiating the corresponding 
log-transformed means and two -sided 95% CIs. Results will be presented for both age groups 
combined  as well as separately. G eometric mean fold increase will also be displayed by 
postvaccination scheduled visit for each treatment group.  
Proportions of participants with human SNA assay titer  and secondary response rates at 
other titers (eg, 15 and 4 -fold rise over baseline) will be reported with associated two -sided 
95% Wilson method CIs by scheduled visit for each treatment group.  
Reverse cumulative distribution plots of human SNA assay vs proportion of participants in 
each treatment group will be ge nerated by scheduled visit. G eometric mean titer  will also be 
plotted over time for each treatment group.  
9.6.2.1  Coprimary Immunogenicity Analysis  
9.6.2.1.1  Day 22 Seroresponse  Rate Analysis   
The superiority of the immune response to PXVX0317 vaccine over that to placebo w ill be 
demonstrated at Day 22 by comparing seroresponse rates  between the two treatment groups 
(the proportion of participants  with a human SNA assay  ; considered the presumptive 
seroprotection rate ). The difference in  seroresponse rates  between the PX VX0317 and 
placebo  groups  will be calculated, along with the 95% CI for the difference based on the 
Newcombe hybrid score method. The lower bound of the two -sided 95% CI on the difference 
in seroresponse rates  between PXVX0317 and placebo groups must be . Additionally, 
the null hypothesis of no difference between seroresponse rate  proportions will be tested 
using a chi -square test with alpha=0.05. No multiplicity adjustment will be employed  (see 
Section 9.4) and no covariate adjustment will be performed.

 The primary comparison will be in the IEP across all age groups combined. Tests will be 
repeated in the mITT population  as a measure of robustn ess, along with tests for each 
population in the separate age strat a. No multiplicity adjustment will be made for the analysis 
of the separate age strat a as the primary population will be the combined age groups . 
9.6.2.1.2  Day 22  Geometric Mean Titer Analysis  
In add ition, Day 22 GMTs will be compared between PXVX0317 and placebo treatment 
groups and will be analyzed via a linear model based on an alpha=0.05. The primary model is 
an ANOVA, with logarithmically transformed  anti-CHIKV SNA titers (log 10) as the 
dependent  variable and treatment group and study site as the fixed effects in the model. The 
adjusted least square means and their 95% CIs calculated based on the ANOVA will be back 
transformed and reported as the group GMT values. All tests will be carried out at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.05 and no adjustment for multiplicity will be applied.   
The primary comparison will be in the IEP across both age groups combined. Tests will be 
repeated in the mITT population  as a measure of robustness , along with tests for each 
population in the separate age strat a. No multiplicity adjustment will be made for the analysis 
of the separate age strat a as the primary population will be the combined age groups . 
9.6.2.2  Secondary Immunogenicity Analysis  
9.6.2.2.1  Key Secondary Immunogenic ity Analyses: Seroresponse Rate and 
Seroresponse Rate Difference at Days 15 and 183, in that Order  
Seroresponse rate s and seroresponse rate differences (PXVX0317 minus placebo)  with 
associated 95% CIs based on antibody titers measured at Days  15 and 183 will be analyzed 
as described above for Day 22. For each time point, t he null hypothesis of no difference 
between seroresponse rate  proportions  in the PXVX0317 vs placebo group  will be tested 
using a chi -square test with alpha=0.05.  
9.6.2.2.2  Geometric Mean Titer at Days 15 and 183  
For the comparison of PXVX0317 to placebo, GMTs based on antibody titers measured at 
Days 15 and 183 will be analyzed as described above for Day 22. Geometric mean fold 
increase s for increase over Day 1 titer will be analysed as described for GMTs for each 
postvaccination time point.   
9.6.2.2.3  Seroconversion at Other Titers  
As described above, secondary response  rates at other titers  (eg, 15 and 4-fold rise over 
baseline) will be reported with associated two-sided 95% Wilson method CIs by scheduled 
visit for each treatment group  using the IEP . The significance of the treatment group 
difference will be assessed using chi -square tests at each visit for the IEP based on both age 
groups combined with an alpha=0.05.

This exploratory endpoint will be evaluated in the CHIKV genotype subset population  for 
both age strata combined .   
9.6.3 Investigational Product Administration and Treatment Compliance  
Investigatio nal product  administrat ion data will be summarized for the randomized 
population and listed by participant . 
Treatment compliance is not applicable since this study involves a single, in -clinic IP 
administration.  
9.6.4 Safety Analyses  
The safety of PXVX0317 in adults ≥65 years of age will be evaluated using solicited AEs 
occurring from IP administration on Day 1 until Day 8 and unsolicited AEs from Day 1 
through Day 29, AESI , MAAEs,  and SAEs though Day 183 End of Study Visit, and vital 
signs.  
9.6.4.1  Adverse Events  
Adverse event s will be coded to the MedDRA dictionary SOC and PT. They will be graded  
for severity according to Section 8.1.8 . Only treatment -emergent AEs will be collected (ie, 
those after the start of IP administration ). Adverse event s will be reported using both  age 
strata pooled , but selected AE analyses will be repeated for the  separate age strata . All AE 
tabulations and participant  listings  will be based on the safety population.  
Solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, AESI , and SAEs will be summarized separately by 
treatment group and SOC, PT, and maximum severity for the safety population for both age 
strata combined.  Only participants with at least one solicited AE observation ( ie, any 
nonmissing values but excluding “ not done/unknown”) will be summarized. Solicited AEs 
continuing beyond seven  days after IP administration  will be combined with the unsolicited 
AEs; a combined summary table of  solicited and unsolicited AEs by treatment group and 
SOC, PT, and maximum severity will also be provided  for the safety population for both age 
strata pooled.  
Additional AE displays will include the following:  
• Solicited AE s ≥Grade 3  
• Treatment -related (“possibly” , “probably”  or “definitely ”) solicited AEs  
• Solicited AEs: d ay of first onset , duration , day postinjection, and occurrence of at 
least one solicited AE by category (local, systemic)  
• Unsolicited AE s ≥Grade 3  
• Treatment -related (“possibly ”, “probab ly” or “definitely ”) unsolicited AE s

 • Medically attended AEs  
• Treatment -related MAAEs  
• AEs leading to study discontinuation  
• Fatal AEs , if any  
• Treatment -related (“possibly ”, “probably” or “definitely ”) SAE s 
Separate participant data listings of solicited and unsolicited AEs sorted by participant 
identifier and AE start date will be generated.  Diary compliance will not be summarized.  
9.6.4.2  Vital Signs  
Pre- and post -IP administration v ital signs data will be listed by participant , visit,  and time 
point for each treatment group for the safety population.  
9.6.5 Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses of key safety and immunogenicity endpoints may be performed  by age 
subgroups (65 to < 75 and ≥75 years of age), sex, race, ethnicity, and baseline serost atus (if 
more than 10% of participants are seropositive at baseline) . 
9.6.6 Planned Interim Analyses  and Criteria for Study Termination  
The SMC (Section s 3.5 and 8.5) will review aggregated, blinded safety data after the first 50 
participant s have completed seven days of safety follow -up and periodically thereafter as per 
SMC recommendation  according to  the SMC Charter.   
There will be a safety and immunogenicity preliminary  analysis  on data for all participants 
through the Day 29  Visit to facilitat e health authority  presubmission  preparation . The 
analyses will be performed by a th ird-party vendor and results will be reported only at the  
treatment group  summary level preserving the double -blind status on the participant  level.  
No p-value penalty will be asses sed because the Day 22 primary immunogenicity endpoint 
data will be final at the time of preliminary analysis  and no action regarding the study will be 
made based on these findings . 
10 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
10.1 Source Documents and Access  
Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, and observations in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. The source 
documentation requirements described below apply to all source documentati on and study 
records in any form, including those maintained in the institution’s electronic health record 
system, if applicable.

Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 65 of 78 
 
 The PI/Institution will maintain adequate and accurate source documents and study records 
that include all pertinent informati on related to participants’ participation in the study, 
including details but not limited to signed and dated notes on consenting, eligibility, medical 
history, study assessments, IP administration, AEs, concomitant medications, participant 
follow -up infor mation , and other relevant observations.  
Source data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and 
complete. Changes to source data should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry 
and should be explained if necessary (eg, via an audit trail).  
The PI/Institution shall permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory 
inspection(s), providing direct access to source data/documents.  
Records from the study that identify the participant  will be confidential except that they may 
be given to and inspected by the sponsor  (or designee ), the IRB, the FDA, EMA , other 
government agencies as appropriate and will not otherwise be released except as required by 
law. Refer to Section 12.5 Participant Confidentiality. All information provided to the PI by 
the sponsor  is to be considered confidential unless otherwise stated.  
10.2 Data Management  
A valid ated, EDC system will be used during the study. Data management activities to be 
performed for the study will be described in detail in the Data Management Plan (DMP) .  
10.3 Data Collection and Discrepancy Management  
Data collected during the study will be reco rded in the eCRFs designed for this study. 
Investigational sites will have the responsibility for capturing and maintaining accurate eCRF 
data, records, and relevant source documentation, as well as conforming to procedures 
established by the sponsor aroun d system access/security and ensuring a data audit/edit trail 
for data corrections. All source documents will be verified by the study monitor for accuracy. 
Information from external sources such as laboratory data, images, etc , as defined in this 
protocol  will be collected and maintained outside the EDC and reconciled with the eCRF 
data periodically (as applicable). As data are entered into the eCRF, automated edit checks 
will validate data. Additionally, manual reviews will be performed for data discrepan cy by 
the monitor and queries will be generated into the EDC system. After clinical sites respond to 
queries and data corrections are made and reviewed by the monitor, the investigator will 
review and electronically sign the eCRF for each participant. The sponsor will review data 
for accuracy, completeness, and consistency during the conduct of the study and prior to 
database lock.  
For further information on eCRFs, refer to the CRF Completion Guidelines. Details on data 
handling will be described in the DMP .

 10.4 Laboratory Data  
No external laboratory data transfers will be done. Site s will manually enter results of 
HBsAg/HCV antibody/HIV -1/HIV -2 into applicable eCRFs. Chikungunya virus  SNA titer 
results will be handled by the sponsor . 
10.5 File Management at the Investigational Site  
The PI will ensure that the essential study documents  are maintained in accordance with the 
ICH GCP Guideline s and as required by applicable local and federal regulations. The 
PI/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these 
documents.  
10.6 Records Retention at the Investigational Site  
Per ICH guidelines, study documents will be retained for one of the following periods:  
• A period of at least two years after the date of the last approval of a marketing  application 
in an ICH region until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications . 
• A period of at least two years after the sponsor has notified the regulatory authority(ies) 
that clinical investigation with this product is discontinued.  
The PI must not dispose of any records relevant to this study without either (1) written 
permission from the sponsor or (2) provision of an opportunity for the sponsor to collect such 
records. The PI will be responsible to maintain adequate and accurate electr onic or hard copy 
source documents of all observations and data generated during this study, including any data 
queries received from the sponsor (or designee ). Such documentation is subject to inspection 
by the sponsor (or its designee [s]) and relevant re gulatory agencies. If the PI withdraws from 
the study (eg , due to relocation or retirement), all study -related records will be transferred to 
a mutually agreed upon designee within the sponsor’s  specified timeframe. Notice of such 
transfer will be given to  the sponsor in writing.  
10.7 Deviations from the Protocol  
The PI agrees to conduct the clinical study in compliance with the protocol agreed to by the 
sponsor  and approved by the investigational site’s IRB. 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures defined in the protocol . 
The PI or investigational site staff may not deviate from the protocol, except, in rare 
circumstances, as necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to study participant s. In such 
event, both the sponsor  and IRB will be immediately notified.  
The occurrence of protocol deviations will be routinely monitored for by evaluation of PI 
compliance with the protocol, GCP, and  regulatory requirements.  The sponsor will review al l 
protocol deviation s on an ongoing basis and will be responsible for determining if the 
PXVX0317    
Protocol EBSI -CV-317-005, v6.0 (31 Mar 2023 )  
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 67 of 78 
 
 deviation should be categorized as an important protocol deviation.  Important protocol 
deviations  may require additional documentatio n as requested by the sponsor.  
Continued protocol devi ations despite re -education of investigational site personnel, or 
persistent protocol deviations that are reportable to regulatory agencies may result in 
discontinued shipment of IP and termination of further enrollment at the investigational site, 
or termination of the investigational site from the study.  
11 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
11.1 Monitoring  
The assigned clinical study monitor will verify eCRF  entries against source documentatio n at 
regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, 
accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to ICH GCP Guidelines and local  and 
federal regulations applicable to the conduct of the clinical  study . The  PI must make source 
documentation accessible to the study monitor as needed to verify the information in the 
eCRFs . The PI agrees to meet with the study monitor at regular intervals to discuss study 
progress and ensure that any problems detected in the co urse of data monitoring are resolved 
appropriately.  
11.2 Auditing  
The sponsor’s Quality Assurance Department (or designee ) may conduct investigational site 
audits before study initiation, during the study, or after study completion. Audits will include, 
but are not limited to, review of  source documents, verification of  eCRFs  against source 
documents  and review  of essential documents  to ensure compliance with protocol  and 
applicable local and federal regulations . The PI agrees to participate in site audits and assist 
in the prompt resolution of any issues found during audits.  
In the event the PI is contacted by a regulatory agency in relation to this study, the PI and 
investigational site staff must be available to respond to reasonable requests and inspection 
queries made during the inspection process. The PI must provide the sponsor with copies of 
all correspon dence that may affect the review of the current study (eg, Form FDA 483, 
inspectional observations, warning letters). The sponsor will provide any needed assistance 
in responding to regulatory inspections.

the master ICF template during the study.  
The participant  will be asked to read and review the document. The PI will explain the 
research study to the participant  and answer any questions that may arise. A verbal 
explanation will be provided in terms suited to the  participant’s comprehension of the 
purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research 
participant s. Participant s will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent 
form and ask questions prior to signing.  The participant s should have the opportunity to 
discuss the study with their family or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The 
participant  will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done 
specifically for the study.  Participant s must be informed that participation is voluntary and 
that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the 
informed consent document will be given to the participant s for the ir records. The informed 
consent process will be conducted and  documented in the source document (including the 
date), and the form signed, before the participant  undergoes any study -specific procedures.  
The rights and welfare of the participant s will be p rotected by emphasizing to them that the 
quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in 
this study.  
12.2 Institutional Review Board  
Before the start of the study, the protocol, the IB, proposed ICF(s), participant  compensation 
(if any), sponsor -approved study materials and advertisements, and any other written 
information to be provided to the participant , and applicable amendments , will be submitted

 However, a  protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to 
participants will be implemented immediately, followed by IRB notification within five 
working days. The sponsor will submit protocol amendments to the applicable regulatory 
authority(ies).  
13.3 Clinical Study Registration  
The sponsor  is responsible for clinical trial registration and reporting to Clinicaltrials.gov  and 
other registries in accordance with applicable regulations . 
13.4 Publication Policy  
Following th e completion of the study, the data may be considered for reporting at a 
scientific meeting or for publication in a scientific journal. In these cases, the sponsor  will be 
responsible for these activities and may work with a PI (or a number of PIs)  to dete rmine 
how the manuscript is written and edited, the number and order of authors, the publication to 
which it will be submitted and other related issues. The sponsor has final approval authority 
over all such issues.  
Any proposed publication will be subjec t to review conditions and timelines agreed between 
the sponsor and the investigational site(s) PI(s) and detailed in the agreements with these 
parties prior to the start of the study. The sponsor will also post the results of the clinical 
study on Clinica lTrial s.gov (or other applicable registries) in a period no greater than 12 
months from the completion of the study, defined as the time the final participant was 
examined or received an intervention for purposes of final collection of data for the primary  
outcome.  
Data are the property of the sponsor and cannot be published without prior authorization 
from the sponsor , but data and publication thereof will not be unduly withheld.  
All publication rights are delineated in the Clinical Trial Agreement.

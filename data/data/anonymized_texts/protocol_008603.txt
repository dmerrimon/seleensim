Name of Sponsor: Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product: Aptiom® 
Name of Active Ingredient: Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL)  
Title of Study: Efficacy and Safety of Eslicarbazepine Acetate as First Add-on to Levetiracetam or 
Lamotrigine Monotherapy or as Later Adjunctive Treatment for Subjects with Uncontrolled 
Partial-onset Seizures: A Multicenter, Open-label, Non-randomiz ed Trial  
Proposed Indication: Adjunctive treatment for subjects with partial-onset seizures ( POS)  
Study Centers: Multicenter with sites in the United States and Canada  
Phase of Development: 4 
Study Objectives:  
Primary Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness (measured by study retention rate ) of ESL 
administered once daily (QD) as the first adjunctive therapy to  levetiracetam (LEV) or lamotrigine 
(LTG) or as later adjunctive therapy in subjects with POS over a 24-week maintenance period in a 
real-world clinical setting.   
Secondary Objectives:  
 To evaluate the efficacy of ESL QD as a first or later adjunctive therapy based on the 
number of seizures reported via a standardized paper daily diar y over a 24-week 
maintenance period. 
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ESL QD as a first or  later adjunctive therapy. 
 To evaluate the effect of treatment with ESL QD on the quality of life (QOL), behavior, 
and mood. 
Exploratory Objectives :  
 To evaluate the accuracy of an i nvestigational wearable watch device from Empatica in 
recording seizure counts.  
 To evaluate the performance of an investigational electronic se izure diary in the form of a 
smartphone application (Empatica MATE).  
Study Design:  
This is a 31-week, multicenter, 2 -arm, prospective, open-label,  non-randomized, Phase 4 study of ESL 
as adjunctive therapy in adult subjects with a diagnosis of epi lepsy with POS. Two groups of 
ESL-naïve subjects will be evaluated. The groups are defined as follows: 
 Arm 1 (ESL as first add-on): This group will include subjects w ho have been maintained 
on a regimen consisting of a stable dose of LEV or LTG for at l east 1 month (28 days) 
prior to screening and who have not used any adjunctive treatme nt.  
 Arm 2 (ESL as later add-on): This group will include subjects w ho have been maintained 
on a regimen consisting of a sta ble dose of 1 - 2 anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) (excluding 
oxcarbazepine [OXC]) for at least 1  month (28 days) prior to sc reening and who have used 
adjunctive treatment in the past.  
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 5  16 November 2017 The Arm 1 subjects will allow an  assessment of the efficacy and safety of ESL in subjects who are 
early in the course of their disease and being treated with one  of the most common first line AEDs. The 
subjects in Arm 2 are similar t o the subject population in the Phase 3 adjunctive studies, treatment-
resistant subjects who are later in the course of their disease . The inclusion of these subjects in the 
present study will provide an assessment of the efficacy and sa fety of ESL as a later adjunctive therapy 
in a real world clinical setting. In addition, this study will provide data from both Arm 1 and Arm 2 for 
several behavioral, mood-relate d, and QOL-related assessments t hat were not evaluated in in the 
Phase 3 program. 
Approximately 190 subjects will be  enrolled (approximately 93 s ubjects in Arm 1 and 97 subjects in 
Arm 2). 
The study will consist of a Screening Phase of 1 to 2 weeks, fo llowed by a 2-week Titration Phase, a 
24-week Maintenance Phase, and a Sa fety Follow-up/Taper Phase o f 4 weeks. The last visit in the 
Maintenance Phase (Visit 9) is c onsidered the End of Study (EOS ) visit. 
The screening visit should take place 7 - 10 days prior to the titration visit, and may be extended to 
7 - 17 days if required with con sent of medical monitor. Subjec ts of Asian ancestry who require 
HLA-B*1502 testing (eg do not have prior test results) may have  the screening visit 7 - 17 days prior to 
the titration visit. 
Subjects who withdraw prior to the EOS visit should have an Ear ly Discontinuation Visit (EDV) within 
72 hours.  During the study, there will be 9 site visits and 2 scheduled telephone visits. The follow-up contact to 
collect information on AEs and c oncomitant medications may occu r at a site visit or by a telephone 
call. 
The procedures and assessments pe rformed in this study are described in Table 2.  
The study population has been selected to be similar to subject s treated in a clinical setting. The study 
will include subjects ≥ 18 years old who meet the study inclusi on, do not meet exclusion criteria and 
who can provide written informed  consent. In order to be eligible for participation in the study, subjects 
of Asian ancestry (or subjects f or whom the absence of Asian an cestry cannot be confirmed) must sign 
an additional genetic consent to  undergo blood testing for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 
allele unless they can provide documentation of prior testing to confirm non-carrier status. Asian 
ancestry will be based on subject self-report. Signed informed consent, (including genetic consent for subject s of Asian ancestry, or subjects for 
whom the absence of Asian ancest ry cannot be confirmed) will be  obtained prior to performing any 
study procedures. Subjects will complete the pre-H uman Epilepsy Project (HEP) instrument at screening. The HEP 
instrument is a form administered by an Investigator to obtain a retrospective seizure history, in as 
accurate a manner as possible, in the absence of a retrospective seizure diary. The caregiver may 
contribute to the HEP data. Th ese data will be used for seizure  history only. As part of completing the 
HEP instrument, the Diagnostic Interview for Seizure Classifica tion Outside of Video EEG Recording 
(DISCOVER) will be administered . The DISCOVER form allows researchers to ask subjects with 
epilepsy questions about the subject’s seizures in order to inc rease the likelihood of  proper diagnosis 
and to standardize seizure classification. The intent is to ensure that the subject will use correct and consistent terminology to describe seizure history and when the y complete their daily seizure diaries 
throughout the study. The information on the seizures recorded on the DISCOVER form will not be 
utilized for seizure analyses; it will be used for diagnostic a nd coding purposes only. 
Seizure history at screening will be derived from the HEP. The subje ct will be asked about the 
number 
and types of seizures that occurred for the longest available p eriod up to 3 months prior to screening. 
These data will be recorded by th e Investigator on a separate s eizure history case report form. 
During the study, the numbe r of seizures by type will be obtained from subject entries in a standard
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 6  16 November 2017 paper seizure diary and electronic seizure diary daily starting  at Visit 1 and up to Visit 9 (EOS, the end 
of the 24-week Maintenance Phase). The diaries require an entry  every day whether a seizure occurs or 
not. Subjects will record information for each seizure by date and type of seizure.  
The subject will also be issued a n investigational wearable sei zure detection device at Visit 1 to collect 
exploratory data evaluating the identification of seizure activity based on skin conduction. The subject 
will wear the watch throughout the duration of the study, up to Visit 9. 
Eligible subjects will begin the 2-week Titration Phase on Day 1 (Week 1), during which they will 
initiate treatment with ESL 400 mg/day and remain on that dose for 1 week (Days 1 – 7). Subjects will 
titrate to ESL 800 mg/day the beginning of week 2 (Day 8) and w ill remain on that dose for 1 week up 
to the beginning of the maintenance phase. Subjects will mainta in a minimum dose of 800 mg/day for 
the Maintenance Phase; however, during the Maintenance Phase, s ubjects may titrate in weekly 
increments of 400 mg/day as medically indicated at the discreti on of the Investigator up to a maximum 
dose of 1200 mg/day (Canadian sites) or 1600 mg/day (United Sta tes [US] sites), (based on maximum 
local labelled dose). Additiona l details are provided in Section 10.1.1. 
Subjects who complete the 24-w eek Maintenance Phase may choose to continue treatment with 
commercial ESL. Subjects who cho se not to continue treatment wi th ESL at the end of the 
Maintenance Phase will be gradua lly tapered off drug provided t hat they do not have an AE that 
requires abrupt discontinuation of the study drug. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment with ESL for any  reason will be gradually tapered off 
study drug unless abrupt discontinuation of the drug is require d for the treatment of an AE. Subjects 
who prematurely discontinue treatment with ESL will be withdraw n from the study. 
Subjects should maintain their concomitant AED(s ) at a constant  dosage during the Titration Phase and 
Maintenance Phase of the study . However, subjects on concomitan t carbamazepine (CBZ) may have a 
dose reduction (up to 25% of the total daily dose taken at stud y entry) in the last week of the titration 
period (Week 2) or the first week  of the Maintenance Phase (Week 3), if the subject has intolerable 
AEs related to an association between CBZ and ESL in the opinio n of the Investigator. This reduction 
must be approved by the Medical Monitor. In addition, subjects taking phenytoin who experience 
intolerable AEs suggestive of phe nytoin toxicity may have their  dose of phenytoin reduced up to 15%, 
with the approval of the Medical Monitor. For patients who become seizure free during the trial, patients may reduce dose of baselin e AEDs by a maximum of 25% t o improve overall tolerability at the 
discretion of the Investigator. After the end of the Maintenanc e Phase, AEDs may be adjusted at the 
discretion of the Investigator. 
Subjects who are tolerant of ESL who have not had a rash or all ergic reaction for at least 6 weeks and 
who provide a separate optiona l written genetic consent will be  asked for a saliva sample for HLA 
genotyping. They will also be asked to complete a questionnaire  relating to rash risk factors at or after 
Visit 4. Information from subjects who participate will be used as the control group in a separate rash 
registry study of risk associated with HLA type. 
Subjects who report a serious adverse event (SAE) of rash or ot her allergic reaction regardless of 
causality at any time during the study will be asked to provide  consent to be contacted by the 
University of Pennsylvania on behalf of Sunovion for participation in the separate rash registry study. 
Number of Subjects (planned): Approximately 190 subjects will be  enrolled as available to eit her 
Arm 1 or Arm 2 as defined above.

Statistical Methods : The Statistical Analysis Plan will provide details on the statistical methods 
planned for this study and will be  finalized prior to the database lock. All endpoints will be 
summarized descriptively for Arm 1 and Arm 2 separately. There will be no statistical comparisons 
between Arm 1 and Arm 2. 
The proportion of subjects completing 24 weeks of the Maintenance Phase and the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) will be calcula ted. SSF, 50% and 75% responder ra tes, relative reduction in SSF, and 
proportion of seizure-free subjects during the first 12 weeks, the last 12 weeks, and the 24 weeks of the 
Maintenance Phase will be calcu lated separately. Time on ESL wi ll be calculated from the first dose to

Confidential and Proprie tary 10  16 November 2017 will be provided for laboratory parameters.  
For eC-SSRS score, the percentage  of subjects in each classific ation class for overall and at each 
assessment time will be summarized. NDDI-E, POMS-SF, MOAS, QOLIE-31-P, and EQ-5D scores will be summarized for each evaluation 
time point; changes from baseline will also be summarized. CGI-I and PGI-C scores will be 
summarized for each evaluation time point. 
Sample Size :  
Arm 1 (first add-on): Assuming a completion rate of 60% at 24 w eeks of the Maintenance Phase for 
Arm 1, to show the lower limit of the 95% CI in the rate to be 50% (50%, 70%), the sample size is 
estimated at approximately 93 subjects.  
Arm 2 (later add-on): Assuming the completion rate of 50% at 24  weeks of the Maintenance Phase for 
Arm 2, to show the lower limit of the 95% CI in the rate to be 40% (40%, 60%), the sample size is 
estimated at approximately 97 subjects. 
Total estimates subjects enrollm ent is approximately 190 subjec ts. 
Sample size is calculated based on the precision (a half width of the 95% CI) for the estimate of the 
completion rate as assumed as a bove and is used the Normal appr oximation to the Binomial 
distribution.

a  Eligible subjects will begin the 2-week Titration Phase on Da y 1 (Week 1), during which they will initiate treatment with ES L at 400 mg/day and remain on that dose for 1 week 
(Days 1 – 7). Subjects will titra te to ESL 800 mg/day the begin ning of week 2 (Day 8) and will remain on that dose for 1 week up to the beginning of t he maintenance phase. 
Subjects will maintain a minimum dose of 800 mg/day for the Mai ntenance Phase; however, during the Maintenance Phase, subjects  may titrate  in weekly increments of 
400 mg/day as medically indicated  at the discre tion of the Inve stigator up to a maximum dose of 1200 mg/day (Canadian Sites) o r 1600 mg/day (US sites), (based on maximum 
local labelled dose). Additional details are provided in Section 10.1.1 . Subjects who withdraw prior to the (end of study) EOS visit s hould have an early discontinuation visit 
(EDV) within 72 hours. 
b  Subjects of Asian ancestry (or subjects for whom the absence of Asian ancestry cannot be conf irmed) who cannot provide docum entation stating that they are not carriers of 
HLA-B*1502 must give written informed consent for genotyping.  Asian ancestry will be based on subject self-report. 
c  This consent for genetic saliva sample and associated questionnaire is optional. 
d  Record seizure history (the number and types of seizures that  occurred over the longest availa ble period up to 3 months prio r to screening). 
e  Record all prior and concomit ant medications, including over the counter medications, taken w ithin the previous 60 days. 
f  Includes clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis. Estim ated creatinine clearance using Cockcroft-Gault equation at Scr eening only. 
g  Required for subjects of Asian ancestry (or subjects for whom  the absence of Asian ancestry cannot be confirmed) and who do not have documentation to  show that they are not 
carriers of HLA-B*1502. 
h  Subjects who provided optional separate informe d consent/asse nt only. 
i  A serum pregnancy te st will be given to all female subjects of childbearing potential at scr eening. An on-site urine pregnan cy test will be given to all female subjects of 
childbearing potential at Visits  1-8. Any positive urine pregnancy test will be followed up with a serum test for confirmation of pregnancy. A serum pregnancy test will be given 
to all females subjects of child bearing potential at Visit 9 (E OS) or at the EDV. 
j  The Liverpool Adverse Event Pr ofile collects information on A Es associated with AEDs. 
k  Subjects who elect to continue on commercially available drug  will not be dispensed additional ESL at this visit. Subjects w ho elect to discontinue  ESL will be provided 
sufficient ESL to accommodate the appropriate taper regimen. 
l  Subjects will be provided with t he Empatica watch and instruc ted in the use of the watch. 
m Subjects will be provided a standardized paper daily seizure d iary and an electronic daily seizure diary and instructed in th e use of the diaries. Diaries are to be completed daily 
whether a seizure occurs or not. 
n The “Baseline/Screening” (lifetime) version should be administered at the screening visit and the “Since Last Visit” version at all other time points. 
o The screening visit s hould take place 7 - 10 days prior to the  titration visit, and may be extended to 7  – 17 days if require d with consent of m edical monitor. Subjects of Asian 
ancestry who require HLA-B*1502 te sting (eg, do not have prior test results) may have  the screening visit 7 - 17 days prior to  the titration visit. 
p Subjects who discontinue prior to the EOS visit will be provid ed sufficient ESL to accommodate the appropriate taper regimen.  
q At the Safety Follow-Up visit, the standardized paper daily se izure diary will not be collected; however it will be reviewed as part of the subject’s safety assessments.

4.1. Epilepsy 
Epilepsy, defined by the recurrence of spontaneous unprovoked seizures (ie, not caused by 
systemic, metabolic or toxic disorders) affects more than 50 million adults and children worldwide ( CPMP, 2009). Globally, an estimated 2.4 million people are diagnosed with  epilepsy 
each year. In high-income countries , annual new cases are betwe en 30 and 50 per 100,000 people 
in the general population. In low-a nd middle-income countries, this figure can be up to two times 
higher ( World Health Organization ). There are no known geographic or  racial differences in the 
occurrence of the d isease; it occurs in both men and women and can begin at any age, but is 
more frequent in infancy, ch ildhood, adolescence, and old age. 
The primary marker of the diseas e is recurrent seizures which a re classified in the International 
Classification of Epileptic Sei zures as generalized, partial or  focal, and unclassified 
(Dreifuss, 1981). Partial seizures, which are  related to a f ocal brain dysfunction, are the most 
frequent type (approxim ately 60% of cases). 
Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are the major therapeutic intervention for subjects with epilepsy and approximately 60% of newly diagnosed patients are seizure free on a single AED. However, 
about 40% of subjects are not sa tisfactorily con trolled and man y patients suffer from significant 
adverse events (AEs) (CPMP, 2009). T his lack of seizure control  leads to combination therapy, 
but significant proportions of subjects continue to have regular seizures despite therapy with more than one AED. This suggested  the need for a more selective  and less toxic AED, which led 
to the development of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL). 
4.2. Study Conduct Rationale 
ESL is approved for the treatment  of partial-onset seizures (PO S) as monotherapy or adjunctive 
therapy in adults in the US. ESL  is approved in Canada as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of 
POS in patients with epilepsy w ho are not satisfa ctorily contro lled with conventional therapy. 
The current open-label study is designed to investigate the use  of ESL in a real-life clinical 
setting in both subjects early i n the course of their disease (those using ESL as a first add-on) and 
in a treatment-resist ant population (similar to those evaluated  in the Phase 3 adjunctive studies). 
The treatment-resistan t subjects are include d in this study to assess effectiveness of ESL as a 
later adjunctive therapy in a c linical setting in order to dete rmine if the data from Phase 3 studies 
are representative of real world treatment. I n addition, there will be several addi tional behavioral, 
mood-related, and quality of life (QOL)-related assessments in this study that were not evaluated 
in the Phase 3 program. Theref ore, this study will provide new information about the effect of 
adjunctive treatment with ESL  in subjects early in the course o f their disease and in treatment-
resistant subjects.  
This study will be performed in com pliance with International C ouncil for Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) gui delines and applicable local re gulatory requirements.

5.1. Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to evalu ate the effectiveness (measured by study retention rate) of ESL 
administered once daily (QD) as th e first adjunctive therapy to  levetiracetam (LEV) or 
lamotrigine (LTG) or as later adjunctive therapy in subjects wi th POS over a 24-week 
maintenance period in a real -world clinical setting. 
5.2. Secondary Objectives 
 To evaluate the efficacy of ESL QD as a first or later adjuncti ve therapy based on the 
number of seizures reported via  a standardize d paper daily diar y over a 24-week 
maintenance period. 
 To evaluate the safety and toler ability of ESL QD as a first or later adjunctive 
therapy. 
 To evaluate the effect of trea tment with ESL QD on the QOL, behavior, and mood. 
5.3. Exploratory Objectives 
 To evaluate the accuracy of an investigational wearable watch d evice from Empatica 
in recording seizure counts. 
 To evaluate the performance of a n investigational electronic se izure diary in the form 
of a smartphone appli cation (Empatica MATE).

6.1. Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the pr oportion of subjects completing 2 4 weeks adjunctive therapy 
during Maintenance Phase (Visit 9). 
6.2. Efficacy Endpoints 
 Seizure data via the paper diar y will be used to calculate the following seizure related 
endpoints: 
 Standard Seizure Frequency (SSF) during the first 12 weeks, the  last 12 weeks, 
and the 24 weeks of the Maintenance Phase. 
 50% and 75% responder rate (calcul ated as 50% and 75% reduction in SSF from 
baseline) as evaluated during t he first 12 weeks, the last 12 w eeks, and the 
24 weeks of the Maintenance Phase. 
 Relative reduction (%) in SSF from baseline during the first 12  weeks, the last 
12 weeks, and the 24 weeks of the Maintenance Phase. 
 Proportion of seizure-free subjec ts during the first 12 weeks, the last 12 weeks, 
and the 24 weeks of the Maintenance Phase. 
 Time on ESL. 
6.3. Other Endpoints 
 Changes from baseline in the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for 
Epilepsy (NDDI-E)-6-item questionnaire. 
 Changes from baseline in the Profile of Mood States Short-form (POMS-SF). 
 Changes from baseline in the agi tation/behavioral measurements as evaluated by the 
Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS).  
 Changes from baseline in Quality o f Life in Epile psy-Patient-We ighted 
(QOLIE-31-P) scores. 
 Change from baseline in EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire ( EQ-5D) scores. 
 Clinical Global Impression of Imp rovement (CGI-I) scores at eac h evaluation time 
point. 
 Patient’s Global Impression of Cha nge (PGI-C) scores at each evaluation time point. 
6.4. Safety Endpoints 
 Number and percentage of subjects with AEs.

7.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a 31-week, multicenter, 2-arm, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, Phase 4 study of 
ESL as adjunctive therapy in adul t subjects with a diagnosis of epilepsy with POS. Two groups 
of ESL-naïve subjects will be evaluated. The groups are defined  as follows: 
 Arm 1 (ESL as first add-on): This group will include subjects who have been maintained on a regimen consisti ng of a stable dose of LEV or L TG for at least 
1 month (28 days) prior to scr eening and who have not used any adjunctive treatment.  
 Arm 2 (ESL as later add-on): This group will include subjects who have been maintained on a regimen consisti ng of a stable dose of 1-2 AEDs  (excluding 
oxcarbazepine [OXC]) for at least 1 month (28 days) prior to sc reening and who have 
used adjunctive tr eatment in the past. 
The Arm 1 subjects will allow an assessment of the efficacy and  safety of ESL in subjects who 
are early in the course of thei r disease and be ing treated with  one of the most common first line 
AEDs. The subjects in Arm 2 are s imilar to the subject populati on in the Phase 3 adjunctive 
studies, treatment-resistant s ubjects who are later in the cour se of their disease. The inclusion of 
these subjects in the present study will provide an assessment of the efficacy and safety of ESL 
as a later adjunctive therapy i n a real world clinical setting.  In addition, this study will provide 
data from both Arm 1 and Arm 2 for several behavioral, mood-rel ated, and QOL-related 
assessments that wer e not evaluated in t he Phase 3 program. 
Approximately 190 subjects will be  enrolled (approximately 93 subjects in Arm 1 and 
97 subjects in Arm 2). 
The study will consist of a Screening Phase of 1 to 2 weeks, fo llowed by a 2-week Titration 
Phase, a 24-week Maintenance Phase, and a Safety Follow-up/Tape r Phase of 4 weeks. The last 
visit in the Maintenance Phase ( Visit 9) is considered the End of Study (EOS) visit. 
The screening visit should take place 7 - 10 days prior to the titration visit, and may be extended 
to 7 – 17 days if required with consen t of medical monitor. Sub jects of Asian ancestry who 
require HLA-B*1502 testing (eg, do not  have prior test results) may have the screening visit 
7 - 17 days prior to the titration visit. 
Subjects who withdraw prior to t he EOS visit should have an Early Discontinuation Visit (EDV) 
within 72 hours. 
During the study, there will be 9 site visits and 2 scheduled t elephone visits. The follow-up 
contact to collect informati on on AEs and concomitant medicatio ns may occur at a site visit or 
by a telephone call. The procedures and assessments performed in this study are described in Table 2 . 
The study population has been sel ected to be simila r to subjects treated in a clinical setting. The 
study will include subjects ≥  18 years old who meet the study i nclusion, do not meet exclusion 
criteria and who can provide wri tten informed consent. In order to be eligible for participation in 
the study, subjects of Asian ancestry (or subjects for whom the  absence of Asian ancestry cannot 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 28 16 November 2017 be confirmed) must sign an additional genetic consent to underg o blood testing for the human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 allele unless they can provide d ocumentation of prior testing 
to confirm non-carrier status. A sian ancestry will be based on subject self-report. A full 
description of inclusion/exclu sion criteria is available in Section 8 . 
Signed informed consent (including genetic consent for subjects  of Asian ancestry, or subjects 
for whom the absence of Asian ancestry cannot be confirmed) wil l be obtained prior to 
performing any study procedures.  
Subjects will complete the pre-Human Epilepsy Project (HEP) instrument at screening. The HEP 
instrument is a form adminis tered by an Investigator to obtain a retrospective se izure history, in 
as accurate a manner as possible, in the absence of a retrospec tive seizure diary. The caregiver 
may contribute to the HEP data. These data will be used for sei zure history only. As part of 
completing the HEP instrument, th e Diagnostic Interview for Seizure Classification Outside of 
Video EEG Recording (DISCOVER) will be administered. The DISCOV ER form allows 
researchers to ask subjects with epilepsy questions about the s ubject’s seizures in order to 
increase the likelihood of prope r diagnosis and to standardize seizure classifica tion. The intent is 
to ensure that the subject will  use correct and c onsistent term inology to describe seizure history 
and when they complete their da ily seizure diaries throughout t he study. The information on the 
seizures recorded on the DISCOVE R form will not be utilized for seizure analyses; it will be 
used for diagnostic and coding purposes only. Additional inform ation on the DISCOVER form 
and the HEP instrument are available in Section 11.2.2.1 and Section 11.2.2.2, respectively. 
Seizure history at screening will be derived from the HEP. The subject will be asked about the 
number and types of seizures th at occurred for the longest avai lable period up to 3 months prior 
to screening. These data will be recorded by the Investigator o n a separate seizure history case 
report form. 
During the study, the number of seizures by type will be obtain ed from subject entries in a 
standard paper diary and an elect ronic seizure diary daily starting at Visit 1 and up to Visit 9 
(EOS, the end of the 24-week Maintenance Phase). The diaries re quire an entry every day 
whether a seizure occurs or not . Subjects will record informati on for each seizure by date and 
type of seizure. A full description of the use of the seizure diaries is provided in Section 11.2.2.4. 
The subject will also be issued an investigational wearable sei zure detection device at Visit 1 to 
collect exploratory d ata evaluating the identification of seizu re activity based on skin conduction. 
The subject will wear the watch throughout the duration of the study, up to Visit 9. Additional 
details are available in Section 11.2.3. 
Eligible subjects will begin the 2-week Titration Phase on Day 1 (Week 1), during which they 
will initiate treatment with E SL 400 mg/day and remain on th
at dose for 1 week (Days 1 - 7). 
Subjects will titrate to ESL  800 mg/day the beginning of week 2  (Day 8) and will remain on that 
dose for 1 week up to the beginning of the maintenance phase. S ubjects will maintain a 
minimum dose of 800 mg/day for the Maintenance Phase; however, during the Maintenance 
Phase, subjects may titrate i n weekly increme nts of 400 mg/day as medically indicated at the 
discretion of the Investigator  up to a maximum dose of 1200 mg/ day (Canadian sites) or 
1600 mg/day (US sites) (based on maximum local labelled dose). Additional detail s are provided 
in Section 10.1.1 . 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 29 16 November 2017 Subjects who complete the 24-week  Maintenance Phase may choose to continue treatment with 
commercial ESL. Subjects who chos e not to continue treatment wi th ESL at the end of the 
Maintenance Phase will be gradually tapered off drug provided that they do not have an AE that 
requires abrupt disconti nuation of the study drug. 
Subjects who prematurely discontin ue treatment with ESL for any reason will be gradually 
tapered off study drug. However, a brupt disconti nuation of the drug is permitted for the 
treatment of an AE. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment with ESL will be 
withdrawn from the study. 
Subjects should maintain their c oncomitant AED(s) at a constant  dosage during the Titration 
Phase and Maintenance Phase of the study. However, subjects on concomitant carbamazepine 
(CBZ) may have a dose reducti on (up to 25% of the total daily d ose taken at study entry) in the 
last week of the Titration Phas e (Week 2) or the first week of the Maintenance Phase (Week 3), 
if the subject has intolerable AEs related to an association be tween CBZ and ESL in the opinion 
of the Investigator. This re duction must be approved by the Medical Monitor. In addition, 
subjects taking phenytoin who experi ence intolerable AEs suggestive of phenytoin toxicity may 
have their dose of phenytoin r educed up to 15%, with the approv al of the Medical Monitor. For 
patients who become seizure fr ee during the trial, patients may  reduce dose of baseline AEDs by 
a maximum of 25% to improve overall tolerability at the discret ion of the Investigator. After the 
end of the Maintenance Phase, AED s may be adjusted at the discr etion of the Investigator. 
Subjects who are tolerant of E SL who have not had a rash or allergic reaction for at least 6 weeks 
and who provide a separate optional written genetic consent wil l be asked for a saliva sample for 
HLA genotyping. They will also be asked to complete a questionn aire relating to rash risk factors 
at or after Visit 4. Informati on from subjects who participate will be used as the control group in 
a separate rash registry study of  risk associated with HLA type . 
Subjects who report a SAE of ras h or other allerg ic reaction re gardless of causality at any time 
during the study will be asked to provide consent to be contacted by the University of 
Pennsylvania on behalf of Sunovion  for participation in the sep arate rash registry study. 
Details of the study assessments  and other procedures to be per formed at each visit are presented 
in Table 2 , Schedule of Assessments, and Section 11 , Study Assessments. If  necessary, subjects 
may return to the clinic at a ny time for an unscheduled visit. 
7.2. Treatment Assignment and Blinding 
This is an open-label, and non-randomized study. Subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatment 
arms defined by their prior treatme nt with AEDs as described for Arm 1 and Arm 2 above in 
Section 7.1.  
7.3. Rationale 
7.3.1. Rationale for the Study Design 
This study is designed to evaluat e the long-term effectiveness,  safety, and tolerability, (as 
measured by study retention over th e 24-week Maintenance Phase)  of ESL given as adjunctive 
therapy in adult subjects ≥ 18 y ears of age. The study will ass ess effectiveness and safety of ESL 
when administered as adjunctive  therapy in ESL-naïve subjects w ho have never used adjunctive 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 30 16 November 2017 therapy previously and in ESL-n aïve subjects who have used adjunctive therapy previously, but 
are seeking additional therapeu tic options. The open-label design is appropriate to assess safety 
and tolerability in th is subject population. 
7.3.2. Rationale for the Dosages 
The ESL doses for this study have been selected based on approv ed adult ESL doses in the US 
(1600 mg QD) and Canada (1200 mg QD). 
7.3.3. Rationale for the Study Population 
This study is designed to investig ate the use of ESL in a real- life clinical setting. In order to 
evaluate ESL in the type of pati ents encountered in clinical pr actice, it includes both subjects 
early in the course of their dis ease and in treatment-resistant  subjects later in the course of their 
disease who have tried adj unctive therapy in the past. 
7.3.4. Rationale for the Endpoints 
The primary endpoint, retenti on in the study throughout the 24- week Maintenance Phase, was 
selected because both efficacy a nd tolerability/safety factor i nto the subject’s willingness to 
complete this phase of the st udy. Therefore, retention is a goo d measure of the effectiveness of 
ESL in clinical practice. 
Standard measurements are used f or the evaluation of changes in  seizure activity, safety and 
evaluations of quality of  life, mood and behavior.

Tablets will be taken by mouth, QD. 
Aptiom may be taken with or wit hout food. Tablets may be crushed and mixed with food if the 
subject is incapable of swallo wing a tablet. All tablets must b e taken simultaneously. Subjects 
are to take study drug at approxima tely the same time each day.  
10.1.1. Treatment with Study Drug  
Eligible subjects will begin the 2-week Titration Phase on Day 1 (Week 1), during which they 
will initiate treatment with E SL 400 mg/day and remain on that dose for 1 week (Days 1 - 7). 
Subjects will titrate to ESL  800 mg/day the beginning of week 2  (Day 8) and will remain on that 
dose for 1 week up to the beginning of the maintenance phase. S ubjects will maintain a 
minimum dose of 800 mg/day for the Maintenance Phase; however, during the Maintenance 
Phase, subjects may titrate i n weekly increme nts of 400 mg/day as medically indicated at the 
discretion of the Investigator  up to a maximum dose of 1200 mg/ day (Canadian sites) or 
1600 mg/day (US sites) (based on max imum local labelled dose). 
During the 24-week Maintenan ce Phase, only one reduction to a minimum of 800 mg/day is 
permitted. Subjects requiring doses < 800 mg/day will be discon tinued from the study. 
Subjects who complete the 24-week  Maintenance Phase may choose to continue treatment with 
commercial ESL. Subjects who chos e not to continue treatment wi th ESL for any reason will be 
gradually tapered off drug unless abrupt discontinuation of the  drug is required in response to an

Subjects should continue treatme nt with their previously prescribed drugs; background 
concomitant AEDs will not be supplied by Sunovion. Subjects sho uld maintain the ir concomitant 
AED(s) at a constant dosage during the Titration Phase and Main tenance Phase of the study.  
However, subjects on concomitant  CBZ may have a dose reduction (up to 25% of the total daily 
dose taken at study entry) in the last week of the titration period (Week 2) or the f irst week of the 
Maintenance Phase (Week 3), if th e subject has intolerable AEs related to association between 
CBZ and the study drug in the opinion of the Investigator. This reduction must be approved by 
the Medical Monitor. In additi on, subjects taking phenytoin who  experience intolerable AEs 
suggestive of phenytoin toxicity may have their dose of phenyto in reduced up to 15%, with the 
approval of the Medical Monitor. For patients who become seizur e free during the trial, patients 
may reduce dose of baseline AE Ds by a maximum of 25% to improve  overall tolerability at the 
discretion of the Investigator. A fter the end of the Maintenanc e Phase, AEDs may be adjusted at 
the discretion of the Investigator.

11.1. Medical History, Demographics , and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline charact eristics include date of birth,  sex, ethnicity, race, weight, 
height, brief physical examinati on results, and medical history  will be collected. For medical 
history, only relevant/signifi cant medical his tory and recurren ce of any condition will be 
collected. The collection of seizu re history is discussed in Se ction 11.2.2. 
11.2. Primary and Efficacy Assessments 
11.2.1. Retention Rate 
The primary assessment will be r etention rate, calculated as th e proportion of subjects 
completing the 24-week Maint enance Phase (Visit 9). 
11.2.2. Seizures 
11.2.2.1. Seizure Classification 
At Screening, the Investigator will administer the Diagnostic I nterview for Seizure Classification 
Outside of Video EEG Recording ( DISCOVER) Form. This questionna ire is designed to allow 
researchers to ask subjects with epilepsy questions about the patient’s seizures in order to 
increase the likelihood of prope r diagnosis and to standardize seizure classifica tion. The intent is 
to ensure that the subject will  use correct and c onsistent term inology to describe the seizures they 
are experiencing when they report their seizure history and com plete their seizure diaries. The 
information on the seizures recorded on the DISCOVER form will not be utilized for seizure 
analyses; it will be used for diagnostic and coding purposes on ly. 
11.2.2.2. Pre-Human Epilepsy Project Instrument 
At screening, subjects  will complete the H EP. The caregiver may  contribute to the HEP data. 
The HEP instrument is a form a dministered by an Investigator to  obtain a retrospective seizure 
history, in as accurate a manner as possible, in the absence of  a retrospective seizure diary. These 
data will be used for  seizure history only. 
11.2.2.3. Seizure History 
Seizure history at screening will be derived from the HEP. The subject will be asked about the 
number and types of seizures th at occurred for the longest avai lable period up to 3 months prior 
to screening. These data will be recorded by the Investigator o n a separate seizure history case 
report form. 
11.2.2.4. Seizure Diaries 
To record seizures during the s tudy, a standardized paper seizu re diary and an electronic seizure 
diary will be dispensed at Vis it 1. The subjects will be traine d on use of the diaries by the site 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 39 16 November 2017 personnel. The subjects will also receive a copy of the descrip tion of seizure types as presented 
in the DISCOVER form to ensure that the subject will use correc t and consistent terminology to 
describe the seizures they are experiencing during the study. 
The diaries will be complet ed daily throughout the study, up until the end of the Maintenance 
Phase (Visit 9, EOS). The diarie s require an entry on every day  whether a seizure occurs or not. 
Subjects will record informati on for each seizure in the paper diary and electronic diary at the 
same time by date and type of seizure. At each return study vis it, the seizure diaries will be 
reviewed by s ite staff. 
Efficacy evaluations of seizure s during the study will be based  on the information recorded in the 
standardized paper daily seizure diary. 
11.2.3. Empatica Watch 
This study will use the Embrace watch produced by Empatica. Emb race measures physiological 
data (3-axis accelerometer and gyro, skin conductance, skin tem perature), runs pattern analysis, 
and issues alerts. The watch is designed such that subjects are  not aware what data are 
collected/measured while the y are wearing the watch.  
The subject should wear the watch on the same arm throughout th e study. The watch should be 
worn on the same side of the body as the subject’s seizure focu s (side of brain), if known. 
For additional details, refer to the study manual. 
11.3. Safety Assessments 
The Investigator or appropriate designee will review results of  safety assessments on a regular 
basis and the Sponsor must be kept fully informed of any clinic ally significant findings either at 
screening or subsequently duri ng study conduct. Safety assessme nts will be performed at the 
visits and times outlined in the  Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2).  
11.3.1. Adverse Events 
Pretreatment events will be moni tored from the time informed co nsent form (ICF) is provided up 
until the first ESL dose administration. 
Adverse events will be collected for each subject. Adverse even ts will be collect ed at study visits 
and during telephone contact. Subjects should be queried in a n on-leading manner, without 
specific prompting (eg, “Has there been any change in your health status since your last visit?”). 
See Section 12.1.1. 
AEs will be monitored from the tim e of first ESL dose administr ation. 
Serious adverse events will be m onitored from the time informed  consent/assent is obtained. 
11.3.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
11.3.2.1. Safety Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory tests required by protocol are listed in Section 20  – Appendix I. 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 40 16 November 2017 Blood and urine samples will be col lected for clinical laborato ry tests. All clinical laboratory 
tests will be performed centra lly. For detailed instructions re garding clinical laboratory 
procedures, sampling, and shipping g uidelines refer to the Cent ral Laboratory Instructions 
Manual. Samples will be processed at a central laboratory to en sure consistency. All clinical 
laboratories will be College of A merican Pathologists (CAP) and  Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments (CLIA) (o r equivalent) certified. Any PO C (point of care) kits that 
are performed on site by study pers onnel rather than in a lab m ust be CLIA waived and the study 
center must possess a CLIA certificate of Waiver. 
11.3.2.2. Urine Drug Screen 
The urine drug screen will be pe rformed at screening. Urine wil l be collected at the clinical site 
in a clean container according to standard procedures. 
11.3.2.3. Pregnancy Testing 
Serum and urine pregnancy testi ng will be performed for female subjects as described in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). 
11.3.3. Genetic Testing 
11.3.3.1. Genetic Testing for the HLA-B*1502 Allele 
The HLA-B*1502 allele in individua ls of Asian ancestry has been shown to be strongly 
associated with the risk of developing Stevens-Johnson syndrome when treated with CBZ. 
Because this study may include A sian subjects who may be taking CBZ, genetic testing will be 
conducted at screening in all subj ects of Asian ancestry (or su bjects for whom the absence of 
Asian ancestry cannot be confir med). Genetic t esting in these s ubjects is not required if prior 
documentation of a negative HLA- B*1502 allele test is available . 
11.3.3.2. Genetic Sampling 
Subjects who are tolerant to E SL for at least 6 weeks and who provide a separate optional written 
genetic consent will be asked t o provide a saliva sample and pr ovide additional medical history 
information. Partici pation is optional. Inf ormation from subjec ts who participate will be used as 
the control group in a separate rash registry study of risk ass ociated with HLA type. Information 
will be de-identified a nd kept confidential. 
Subjects who report a SAE of ras h or other allerg ic reaction re gardless of causality at any time 
during the study will be asked to provide consent to be contacted by the University of 
Pennsylvania on behalf of Sunovion  for participation in the sep arate rash registry study. 
11.3.4. Vital Signs 
Supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and oral temperature will be measured following 5 minutes of seated rest. 
Blood pressure and pulse rate should first be taken with the su bject in the supine position after 
resting for ≥ 5 minutes. 
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be taken again after standing for 2 to 
4 minutes. The same arm shoul d be used during each assessment o f blood pressure and pulse rate 
throughout the study. If a subject  develops symptoms consistent  with orthostatic hypotension 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 41 16 November 2017 (light-headedness, dizziness, or  changes in sensorium upon stan ding) at any point, his or her 
supine and standing blood pressure and pulse rate should be col lected at that time in the manner 
described above. Vital signs will be obtained prior to clinical  laboratory collection and 
performance of an ECG. 
11.3.5. Electrocardiograms 
All ECGs will be obtained in the supine position, after the sub ject has been resting supine for at 
least 10 minutes. ECGs will be 12-lead with a 10-second rhythm strip. ECGs should be obtained 
prior to drawing blood samples. All  attempts should be made to use the same ECG recorder for 
all visits within individual subjects.  
Refer to Section 21  – Appendix II for additi onal information. 
11.3.6. Physical and Neurologic Examinations 
A brief physical examination, ass essing the subject’s overall h ealth and physical condition, will 
be performed according to the site’s standard operating procedu res. A brief neurological 
examination will also be conducted. These examinations will occ ur at screening and at the time 
points indicated in Table 2. 
11.3.7. Safety Scales 
11.3.7.1. Electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The Columbia-Suicide Severity R ating Scale (C-SSRS) is a tool d esigned to systematically 
assess and track suicidal AEs (suicidal behavior  and suicidal i deation). The electronic Columbia-
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) is a computer-automated , subject-reported version of 
the C-SSRS, in which the subjec t’s response to a question prompts and shows the appropriate 
follow-up questions (if any). 
The strength of this suicide classification system is in its ab ility to comprehen sively identify 
suicidal events while limiting the over-identification of suici dal behavior. The eC-SSRS scale 
takes approximately 5 minutes to administer. Occurrence of suic idal ideation is defined as having 
answered “yes” to at least one of  the 5 suicidal ideation sub-categories (wish to be dead, non-
specific active suicidal thoughts , active suicidal ideation wit h any methods [not plan] without 
intent to act, active suicidal i deation with some intent to act  [without specific  plan], and active 
suicidal ideation with specific  plan and intent) at any evaluat ion. Occurrence of suicidal behavior 
is defined as having answered “ye s” to at least one of the 4 su icidal behavior sub-categories 
(actual attempt, interrupted a ttempt, aborted attempt, and prep aratory acts or behavior) at any 
post-baseline evaluation. The “Baseline/Screening” (life time) version should be administe red at the screening visit and the 
“Since Last Visit” version at all other time points. Subjects who express suicidal ideation or behavior in completio n of the eC-SSRS during the 
course of the study should be eva luated by the investigator and  referred to a mental health 
professional at the discr etion of the investigator. 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 42 16 November 2017 11.3.7.2. The Liverpool Adverse Event Profile 
The LAEP is designed as a patien t self-report scale to assess t he frequency of AED side effects. 
It includes 19 items rated on a  4-point Likert scale with 1, never a problem; 2, r arely a problem; 
3, sometimes a problem; and 4, always a problem. Total scores r ange from 19 to 76, with high 
scores indicating more-fre quent symptom reporting. 
The LAEP is introduced to the participants in the questionnaire  with the heading “Here are a few 
questions about your health genera lly.” The recommended preamble to the scale followed with 
the words, “During the last 4 weeks, have you had any of the pr oblems listed.” The problems 
include unsteadiness, tiredness , restlessness, feelings of ange r or aggression to others, 
nervousness and/or agitation, head ache, hair loss, problems with skin (eg, acne, rash), double or 
blurred vision, upset stomach, difficulty in concentrating, tro uble with mouth or gums, shaky 
hands, weight gain, dizziness, s leepiness, depression, memory problems, and disturbed sleep.  
No indication is given within the  questionnaire that the sympto ms listed might be linked to the 
use of medication. 
11.4. Clinical Assessments, Quality of L ife, Behavior and Mood Scales 
11.4.1. EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire 
The EQ-5D is made up of 2 compone nts; health state description and overall health evaluation.  
In the description part, health s tatus is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depre ssion. Mobility dimension asks 
about the person’s walking abil ity. Self-care dimension asks ab out the ability to wash or dress by 
oneself, and usual ac tivities dimension measures performance in  “work, study, housework, 
family or leisure activities.” I n pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort 
they have, and in anxiety/depres sion dimension, it asks how anxious or depressed they are. The 
respondents self-rate their lev el of severity for each dimensio n using a 5-level scale. 
In addition, the respondents evalu ate their overa ll health status using the visual analogue scale. 
11.4.2. Clinical Global Impression – Improvement 
The CGI-I scale is a 7-point scale that requires an approved ra ter to assess how much the 
patient’s illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseli ne state at the beginning of the 
intervention and rated as: 1, ver y much improved; 2, much impro ved; 3, minimally improved; 
4, no change; 5, minimally worse;  6, much worse; or 7, very much worse. 
11.4.3. Patient Global Impression of Change 
The PGI-C is a 7-point scale that requires the subject to asses s the change (if any) in activity 
limitations, symptoms, emotions and overall quality of life sin ce treatment. The subject 
responses include 1) no change (or condition has gotten worse),  2) almost the same, hardly any 
change at all, 3) a little better, but no noticeable change, 4) somewhat better, but the change has 
not made any real difference, 5)  moderately better, and a sligh t but noticeable change, 6) better, 
and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference or 7) a great deal 
better, and a considerable improve ment that has made all the di fference.

Confidential and Proprie tary 43 16 November 2017 11.4.4. Quality of Life in Epilepsy-Patient-Weighted  
The QOLIE-31-P contains seven mu lti-item scales that investigate the following health concepts: 
emotional well-being, social func tioning, energy/fatigue, cogni tive functioning, seizure worry, 
medication effects and overall QOL. The QOLIE-31-P overall scor e is obtained using a weighted 
average of the multi-item scale scores. 
11.4.5. POMS-Short Form 
The POMS-SF is an instrument de signed to assess transient, dist inct mood states and consists of 
a list of 37 adjectives. Respondent s indicate the degree to whi ch each adjective describes 
themselves during the last wee k using a 5-point Likert scale. T his format yields both an overall 
Total Mood Disturbance score as well as scores for each of the six subscales contained in the 
original POMS: Fatigue-Inertia, V igor-Activity, Te nsion-Anxiety , Depression-Dejection, 
Anger-Hostility, and Confusion-Bewilderment. The items included  in the short fo rm scales are: 
Depression = unhappy, sad, blue, hopeless, discouraged, miserab le, helpless, worthless; 
Vigor = lively, active, energet ic, cheerful, full of pep, vigorous; Confusion = confused, unable to 
concentrate, bewildered, forgetful, uncertain about things; Ten sion = Tense, on edge, uneasy, 
restless, nervous, anxious; Anger = angry, peeved, grouchy (written as grovely in some versions), 
annoyed, resentful, bitter, furious ; Fatigue = worn-out, fatigu ed, exhausted, weary, bushed. 
11.4.6. Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy 
The NDDI-E is a 6-item questionn aire validated to screen for de pression in people with epilepsy. 
The NDDI-E consists of the following items:  
 Everything is a struggle. 
 Nothing I do is right.  
 Feel guilty. 
 I’d be better off dead. 
 Frustrated. 
 Difficulty finding pleasure. 
Each item is rated on a 4-point L ikert scale with higher scores  indicating a more severe response. 
11.4.7. The Modified Overt Aggression Scale 
The MOAS is a 4-part behavior rating scale designed to measure four types of aggressive 
behavior as witnessed in the past week. The MOAS will be comple ted by an approved rater. 
Each section consists of 5 questi ons, with the first section regarding verbal aggression, the 
second section focusing on aggressi on against property, the thi rd section measuring 
autoaggression, and the fourth s ection concerning physical aggr ession. Respondents are asked to 
check whether each statement desc ribes behavior over the previo us week. 
Total scores on the MOAS range from 0-40, with a higher score i ndicating more aggressive 
behavior. Each checked stateme nt receives 1 point, then points from each secti
on are summed. 
Section scores are weighted as follows: 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 44 16 November 2017 Scores from the “Aggression Again st Property” section multiplie d by 2; Scores from the 
“autoaggression” section multipl ied by 3; Scores from the “physical aggression” section 
multiplied by 4. Weighted scores are then added together to yie ld the total score. 
11.5. Study Visits and Assessments 
11.5.1. Screening: Visit 1 (-1 t o -2 Week [+ 3 days]) 
Subjects will be evaluated at th e Screening Visit over the 1- t o 2-week Screening Phase to

12.1. Definitions 
12.1.1. Adverse Events 
An AE is any untoward medical occu rrence temporally associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
Untoward medical occurrences that occur between t he time of signing the ICF and first drug 
administration are pre-treatment e vents. Those that occur after first administration of study drug 
are considered AEs. An AE can, therefore, be any unf avorable and unintended sign (i ncluding an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease o ccurring after the administratio n of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considere d related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs may 
include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre-ex isting conditions. 
In this study, seizures should not routinely be considered as A Es. Individual seizures (including 
clusters of seizures and status e pilepticus) which are sufficie ntly severe to require intervention 
beyond what is usual for the subj ect or hospitalization may be recorded as AEs. Worsening of 
seizures (either in severity, pa ttern, type, or frequency) and injury or other adve rse consequences 
of seizures should be recorded as AEs. The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the  event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical informati on. In such cases, the diagnosis  should be documented as the AE 
and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
12.1.2. Serious Adverse Events 
A SAE is an AE that meets one or m ore of the following criteria : 
 Results in death. 
 Is life-threatening. 
 Requires hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitaliz ation. 
 Results in persistent or signifi cant disability or incapacity. 
 Is a congenital anom aly or birth defect. 
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject o r may require a 
medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes  listed above. 
Examples of such medical event s include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, or blood dyscrasias.  
The term “severe” is often used t o describe the severity of a s pecific event (as in mild, moderate, 
or severe myocardial infarction) (see Section 12.3 ); the event itself , however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache) . This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject's life or  functioning as  defined by the criteria above. 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 52 16 November 2017 During the study, if a subject has  a hospitalization or procedure (eg, elective surgery) that was 
scheduled before the study entr y, ie, before informed consent for an event/condition that 
occurred before the study, the hos pitalization is considered a therapeutic intervention and not the 
result of a SAE. However, if th e event/condition worsens during  the study, it should be reported 
as an AE (or SAE, if the event/condition results in a serious o utcome such as prolongation of 
hospitalization). 
Life-threatening means that the s ubject was, in the view of the  Investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the event as it o ccurred. This definition does not i nclude an event that had it occurred 
in a more severe form might have caused death. 
SAE criteria information will be captured on the CRF. 
12.2. Objective Findings 
Clinically significant abnormal objective fi ndings (eg, clinica l laboratory value, ECG value, and 
physical examination observation) will also be recorded as AEs.  
When a clear diagnosis is availa ble that explains the objective  findings, this diagnosis will be 
recorded as the AE, and not the a bnormal objective finding (eg,  viral hepatitis wil l be recorded as 
the AE, not transaminase elevati on). If a definite diagnosis is not available, then record the sign 
(eg, clinically significant eleva tion of transamin ase levels) o r symptom (eg, abdominal pain) as 
the AE. Clinical laboratory test resu lts will be reviewed by the Invest igator. The Investigator must 
determine the clinical signifi cance of all out of range values.  Clinical laboratory tests with 
possibly drug related or clinicall y relevant abnormal values of uncertain causality may be 
repeated. Any abnormal values tha t persist should be followed a t the discretion of the 
Investigator. The Investigator w ill document that he/she has reviewed laboratory tests (for paper 
reports: initial and date all pages; for electronic reports: do cument in electronic system or add 
separate comment to CRF). Clinical Laboratory Tests Outsi de the Normal Range: Any value o utside the normal range will be 
flagged for the attention of the Investigator or appropriate de signee at the study center. The 
Investigator or appropriate designee will indicate whether or n ot the value is  of clinical 
significance. If the re sult of any test (or repeat test, if don e) from the samples taken during 
screening is indicate d as clinically significant and is not cov ered by the inclusion criteria in 
Section 8.1 , the subject will not be allowed into the study. Additional te sting during the study 
may be done if medically indicated. If a clinically significant  abnormality is found in the samples 
taken after dosing, during the st udy, and/or at the EOS/EDV Vis it, this should be recorded as an 
AE and the subject will be followed until the test(s) has (have ) normalised or stabilised. 
All on-site ECG tracings will be reviewed by the Investigator. The Investigator must determine 
the clinical significance of al l abnormal ECGs. ECG with possib ly drug-related or clinically 
relevant abnormal findings of un certain causality may be repeat ed. Any abnormal ECGs that 
persist should be followed at th e discretion of the Investigator. ECG tracings will be initialed and 
dated on all pages by the Investigator.

Confidential and Proprie tary 53 16 November 2017 12.3. Collection and Recordin g of Adverse Events 
All pre-treatment events and AEs  must be recorded in the subject’s study records/source 
documents. All pre-treatment events must be recorded on the CRF. All AEs must be recorded on 
the CRF from first dos e administration through the final study visit. All SAEs must be recorded 
on the CRF from the time informe d consent/assent is obtained th rough the final study visit. 
All AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of the  condition, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
Each AE is to be evaluated for  duration, severity, frequency, s eriousness, action taken with the 
study treatment, outcome, and causa l relationship to the study treatment. Definitions for severity, 
frequency, action taken with the  study treatment, outcome, and causal relationship to the study 
treatment are presented below. 
The severity of AE: 
 Mild  – Ordinarily transient symptoms that do not influence performa nce of subject’s 
daily activities. Other treatme nt is not ordinarily indicated. 
 Moderate  – Marked symptoms sufficient to make the subje ct uncomfortable . 
Moderate influence on performance of subject’s daily activities . Other treatment may 
be necessary. 
 Severe  – Symptoms cause considerable di scomfort. Substantial influenc e on subject’s 
daily activities. May be unable to continue the study, and othe r treatment may be 
necessary. 
The frequency of AE: 
 Once – an isolated episode.  
 Intermittent  – occurs on 2 or more separate occasions. 
 Continuous  – does not abate from date of onset to date of resolution. 
The action taken with the study treatment: 
 Drug Interrupted  – Study drug stopped temporarily. 
 Drug Withdrawn  – Study drug stopped permanently. 
 Dose Reduced.  
 Dose Increased. 
 Dose Not Changed.  
 Not Applicable. 
 Unknown.  
The outcome of the AE: 
 Recovered/Resolved. 
 Recovering/Resolving. 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 54 16 November 2017  Not Recovered/Not Resolved. 
 Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae. 
 Fatal. 
 Unknown. 
The causal relationship of the  AE to the study treatment:  
 Not related  
  Not related – Improbable temporal relations hip and is plausi bly related to other 
drugs or underlying disease.  
 Related  
 Possible – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug a dministratio n, but 
could be related to concurrent  drugs or underlying disease. 
 Probable  – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug administratio n, is 
unlikely to be attributable t o concurrent drugs or underlying d isease, and there is a 
plausible mechanism t o implicate the study drug. 
 Definite  – occurred in a reasonable time after study drug a dministratio n and 
cannot be explained by concurre nt drugs or underlying disease. The adverse event 
should respond to dechallenge/rech allenge, however, this is not mandatory before 
assigning a definite causality. 
The Medical Monitor is the initia l contact person for protocol- related questions or discussion of 
AEs. The contact information for the Medical Monitor as well as  other emergency contact 
information can be found in Table 1  of this protocol. 
12.4. Immediately Reportable Events 
The following medical events mu st be immediately reported to the Sponsor: 
 SAE. 
 Pregnancy. 
Emergency contact informat ion can be found in Table 1. 
12.4.1. Serious Adverse Event 
If the Investigator or study cente r staff becomes aware of a SA E that occurs in a study subject 
after obtaining informed cons ent through 30 days following the last dose of the study 
medication, this must be reporte d immediately to the Sponsor wh ether considered related or 
unrelated to the study drug. SAE s must be recorded on the CRF a nd the data recorded should 
agree with that on the SAE form. 
SAEs will be followed until resolution, loss to follow-up, stabilization of condition, or the event 
is otherwise explained. 
In addition to the initial tele phone notification, an initial S AE form as applicable must be 
completed and signed and sent vi a fax or email (see Table 1) to  PPD Pharmacovigilance 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 55 16 November 2017 (PPD-PVG) within 1 business day of the Investigator or study center staff becoming aware of the 
event. The SAE form must be sig ned by the Investigator or appro priate designee. PPD-PVG 
provides the SAE form used to report SAEs. 
The Sponsor or designee will promptly notify all study centers and Investigators of a SAE that is 
determined to be expedited to the  Regulatory Aut horities in acc ordance with applicable law(s) 
and regulation(s). These SAEs mu st be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) by the Principal In vestigator or the  appropriate 
person at the study center if requi red per IRB/IEC guidelines. 
If an SAE is reported after par ticipation of the study, the Inv estigator or an aut horized delegate 
should report SAEs “spontaneously ” to PPD-PVG if considered at least possibly related to the 
study drug. 
12.4.2. Pregnancy 
Pregnancies that occur from the time that informed consent is s igned through 30 days following 
the last dose of the study medication will be collected and rep orted on the Pregnancy Event Form. 
If a subject or a subject’s part ner becomes pregnant during the  course of the study, they will be 
instructed to report the pregnancy to the Investig ator (see below). All female pregnant subjects 
will be instructed to commence discontinuation of the study med ication. Further, the subject (or 
female partner of male subject) will be requested to return promptly/within 48 hours of the first 
notification of pregnancy to the  study center and undergo a ser um/urine pregnancy test, as 
confirmation of pregnancy. If posit ive, the female pregnant sub ject will no longer receive any 
additional study medication. All pr egnancies, whether or not the subject received any additional 
study medication, will be follo wed until resolution (ie, termin ation [voluntary or spontaneous] or 
birth). 
To report a pregnancy, the Pregna ncy Event Form must be complet ed and sent via fax to 
PPD- PVG within 1 business day of the Investigator or study cen ter staff becoming aware of the 
pregnancy. The Sponsor provides the Pregnancy Event Form. Pregnancy itself is not regarded a s an AE unless there is a sus picion that the study drug may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or other AEs were detected.

Subjects may terminate the study pa rticipation at any time for any reason. 
Subjects may be discontinued from the study at any time for any  of the following reasons: 
 Adverse event. 
 Lack of efficacy (specify). 
 Withdrawal by subject (specify).  
 Withdrawal by Investigator (specify). 
 Protocol devia tion (specify). 
 Study terminated by Sponsor. 
 Death. 
 Pregnancy (subject or subject’s partner). 
 Other (specify). 
If at any time during the course of the study, in the opinion o f the Investigator, the subject may 
no longer safely participate due t o a change in medical status (eg, experiences an AE, becomes 
pregnant), the subject must be  discontinued from the study. 
Subjects may discontinue the study at any time due to worsening  of seizures, intolerability, or 
other reasons. 
Subjects who discontinue the study will undergo taper of study drug, unless abrupt 
discontinuation of the drug is re quired in response to an AE (e g, rash). 
Subjects who experience an intoler able AE at the lowest dose, o r who are unwilling to attempt a 
dose reduction within the allowed range, will be discontinued from the study. 
The reason and information for s tudy drug discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate 
CRF. 
Subjects who prematurely terminat e the study participation will  not be replaced. 
Every effort should be made for a ll subjects prem aturely discontinuing the study drug, regardless 
of cause, to undergo final evaluation procedures described in Section 11.5.11.

Confidential and Proprie tary 57 16 November 2017 14. STUDY TERMINATION 
The Sponsor reserves the right  to discontinue the study at this  study center or at multiple centers 
for safety or administrative r easons at any time while safeguarding that early termination does 
not compromise subjects’ safet y or well-being. In particular, a  study center that does not recruit 
at an acceptable rate may be closed. Should the study be termin ated and/or the study center 
closed for whatever reason, all  documentation must be returned to the Sponsor or its 
representative. 
If, in the opinion of the Investig ator, clinical  observations s uggest it may be unsafe to continue, 
the Investigator may terminate  part or the entire study after consultation with the Sponsor.

15.1. Sample Size  
Sample size is calculated base d on the precision (a half width of the 95% confidence interval 
[CI]) for the estimate of the completion rate as assumed as bel ow and is used the Normal 
approximation to the Bi nomial distribution. 
Arm 1 (first add-on): Assuming a  completion rate of 60% at 24 w eeks of the Maintenance Phase 
for Arm 1, to show the lower li mit of the 95% CI in the rate to  be 50% (50%, 70%), the sample 
size is estimated at a pproximately 93 subjects. 
Arm 2 (later add-on): Assuming t he completion rate of 50% at 24  weeks of the Maintenance 
Phase for Arm 2, to show the lower limit of the 95% CI in the r ate to be 40% (40%, 60%), the 
sample size is estimated at approximately 97 subjects.  
Total estimated subject enrollment is approximately 190 subject s. 
15.2. Analysis Populations 
The safety population will cons ist of all subjects who have tak en any study medication and will 
be used for all analyses ex cept efficacy analyses.  
The modified intent-to-treat ( mITT) population will include sub jects who are in the safety 
population and have available sei zure data. The mITT population  will be used for efficacy 
analyses. 
15.3. Data Analysis 
The Statistical Analysis Pla n provides details  on the statistic al methods planned for this study 
and will be finalized prior to the database lock. Statistical s ummaries described in sections below 
will primarily be provided for all subjects (ie, overall summar y) in the analysis populations of 
interest unless otherwise stated. All endpoints will be summarized descriptively for Arm 1 and Ar m 2 separately. There will be 
no statistical comparisons between Arm 1 and Arm 2. 
For the efficacy endpoints, base line will be defined as the sei zure data for the longest available 
period up to 3 months prior to scr eening from seizure history a nd from screening to first dose of 
study medication from the  paper seizure diary. 
For all other endpoints, baselin e will be defined as the last n on-missing measurem ent taken prior 
to the first dose of st udy drug administration. 
15.3.1. Subject Disposition  
Subject disposition will be summarized and presented for the nu mber and percentage of subjects, 
who were screened, screen-faile d, completed the study, and discontinued early (including 
reasons for discontinuations).

Confidential and Proprie tary 59 16 November 2017 15.3.2. Drug Exposure 
The number of doses taken as well as the extent of exposure will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics and presented. For each subject, the number of doses  taken will be computed. The 
extent of exposure will be com puted as the number of days from the first exposure to study drug 
to the last exposure to study drug, ignoring missing days. Aver age daily dose will also be 
calculated. 
15.3.3. Important Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations ( IPDs) will be identified and documented based on a review of 
potentially IPDs. The potentiall y IPDs will be identified short ly before database lock, either 
through programmatic checks of s tudy data (eg, in clusion/exclusion criteria violations), as well 
as through review of selected data  listings (eg, Investigator c omments, concomitant 
medications). The potentially IPDs to be reviewed include, but are not limited to, subjects who: 
 Did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria or eligibility was no t adequately verified. 
 Received any prohibited concomitant medication. 
 Developed study withdrawal crite ria but were not withdrawn. 
Individual IPDs will be present ed in a data lis ting. The number  and percentage of subjects with 
IPDs will be summarized by type of deviation as categorized abo ve. 
15.3.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics, including (age, ge nder, race, and ethnicity where  applicable), and other baseline 
characteristics collected at sc reening, such as height, weight, body mass index, and disease 
conditions will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The se data will be presented as a 
listing. 
15.3.5. Primary Analysis 
The proportion of subjects compl eting 24 weeks adjunctive thera py during Maintenance Phase 
and the 95% CI will be calculated for Arm 1 and Arm 2 separatel y. 
15.3.6. Efficacy Analyses 
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively in this  study. Changes in efficacy 
parameters will be calculated w ith reference to the baseline, d efined as the seizure data for the 
longest available period up to 3 months prior to s creening from seizure history and from 
screening to first dose of study m edication from the paper seiz ure diary. 
All seizure related endpoints w ill be calculated based on the d ata from the paper diary. 
Seizure frequency will be standardized to 28-day rate. The SSF and changes from baseline will 
be summarized during the first  12 weeks, the last 12 weeks, and the 24 weeks of the 
Maintenance Phase.  
Two responder rates (50%, and 75% r esponder rates) are defined as subjects who have ≥ 50%, 
and subjects who have ≥ 75% reduc tion in SSF from baseline, respectively. The proportions of 
Protocol SEP093-701, Version 3.01  Eslicarbazepine acetate 
Confidential and Proprie tary 60 16 November 2017 responders in each rate will be summarized during the first 12 weeks, the last 12 weeks, and the 
24 weeks of the Maintenance Phase. 
Relative reduction (%) in SSF from baseline will be calculated during the first 12 weeks, the last 
12 weeks, and the 24 weeks of the Maintenance Phase. 
The proportion (%) of seizure-free subjects will be provided du ring the first 12 weeks, the last 
12 weeks, and the 24 weeks of the Maintenance Phase. Time on ESL will be calculated from the first dose to the last known dose of ESL. The median 
time and 95% CI will be estimated using Kaplan Meier time to ev ent methods. Subjects who 
were still on ESL at the end of study will be censored at the e nd of study. Subjects who dropped 
out of the study while receiving treatment will be an event at the time of the dropout. Change in 
dosage levels during the trea tment period will be ignored.

15.3.8.1. Adverse Events 
All AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory A ctivities (MedDRA) 
version 13.1 or higher. AEs are unt oward medical occurrences: 
 that occurred on or aft er the first dose of  study medication. 
 with a missing start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study medication, 
OR 
 with both a missing start and stop date. 
AEs will be summarized by MedDR A system organ class (SOC) and P referred Term (PT). 
The following AEs will be summarized and presented by MedDRA SO C and PT for the Safety 
population: 
 All AEs (including number of eve nts and subject incidence). 
 AEs by severity (mild, moderate, severe). 
 AEs by relationship to the st udy treatment (related, or not rel ated). 
The following conventions will be followed in summarizing AEs: 
 For subject incidence summaries , each subject will be counted o nly once within each 
SOC and within each PT. 
 If a subject reports more than one AE within a PT and/or a SOC,  the AE with the 
highest known severity within each SOC and within each PT will be included in the 
summaries by severity. 
 For summaries by relationship to the study medication, AEs will  be grouped as 
“related” or “not related.” AEs assessed as “possible,” “probable,” or “definite,” will 
be grouped as “related.” If a su bject reports more than one AE SOC and PT, and any 
are related, it will be s ummarized as related. 
Summaries of SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation or other AE s ummaries will also be 
provided if necessary. A listing of AEs, as well as a listing o f deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation, will be presented. 
15.3.8.2. Adverse Event Profile

summarized descriptiv ely on the actual values and changes from baseline. Shift tables from 
baseline to the end of this study will be provided for laborato ry parameters. 
15.3.8.4. Blood Sodium Levels 
In addition to descriptive summar ies of blood sodium levels and  changes from baseline for each 
assessment time point, the per cent of subjects  with normal base line sodium level reaching 
≤ 135 mEq/L but > 130 mEq/L, ≤ 130 mEq/L but > 125 mEq/L, ≤ 125  mEq/L, and > 10 mEq/L 
reduction (ie, < -10 mEq/L) from baseline will be summarized by  time point. 
15.3.8.5. Electrocardiograms 
ECG abnormalities will be pr esented in a data listing. 
15.3.8.6. Vital Signs and Weight 
Vital signs (supine systolic a nd diastolic blood pressures, res piratory rate, pulse rate, and oral 
temperature) and weight will be summarized using descriptive st atistics at baseline and each 
evaluation visit. Change from baseline will be included in this  presentation as well. In addition, a

from the screening visit will be  captured as AEs as appropriate , and summarized together with 
the other AEs.  15.3.8.8. Concomitant Medications 
All medications will be coded using the WHO-DRUG. 
Any medications taken during the course of the study, with a st art date on or after  the date of the 
first dose of study drug and on or befo re the date of the last dose of study drug; or with a start 
date prior to, and an end date on or a fter, the date of the first dose of study drug, or marked as 
ongoing, will be considered concomit ant medications. Medication s that ended prior to the date of 
the first dose of the study drug will be considered prior medic ations. The number and percentage 
of subjects using each concomitant medication will be summarize d overall according to the 
WHO-DRUG Anatomic Therapeutic C hemical (ATC) level and PT. Subj ects with multiple uses 
of a concomitant medication wil l be counted once by the ATC lev el and PT. 
15.3.8.9. Electronic Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The percentage of subjects in each classificati on class for ove rall and at each assessment time

The proportions of concordance i n the daily seizure frequency during the 24-weeks of the 
Maintenance Phase between the w atch device and paper diary as w ell as between the Mate 
application and paper diary for each subject will be calculated .  
SSF during the first 12 weeks, t he last 12 weeks, and the 24 we eks of the Maintenance Phase will 
be calculated using the seizure  data recorded by the investigational wearable watch device, and 
MATE application from Empatica. The concordance correlation coe fficient (CCC) with 95% 
confidence interval will be cal culated to assess agreement in S SF during the first 12 weeks, the 
last 12 weeks, and the 24 weeks of t he Maintenance Phase betwee n the two Empatica devices 
and the paper diary. 
Scatter plots of the above SSFs  using the seizure data recorded  by the watch device as well as 
Mate application by those from the paper diary will be presented to evaluate agreement 
graphically. 
15.3.10. Treatment of Missing Data 
Subjects who dropped out before s tudy completion are not to be replaced and all available 
information obtained from them will be included in the appropri ate efficacy and safety 
summaries to the time of dropout. No imputation is planned for any safety measures. 
If the date of the seizure is m issing or incomplete and the sei zure cannot be allocated to a study 
period, these data will not be used in the analysis, but will b e presented in the subject data 
listings. If the seizure diary w as returned and there was no seizure data available for a particular 
day during that evaluation period, it will be assumed that the patient had missing seizure data, 
and the day will be excluded from the calculation of the standa rdized seizure frequency. 
Seizure-related variables will be  calculated based on available  data. For dropout subjects, their 
seizure frequency will be derived up to the last period where t he subject had data. The last period 
SSF will be computed based on available data prior to dropout.

DATA COLLECTION, MANAG EMENT, AND QUALITY 
ASSURANCE 
16.1. Data Collection/Electronic Data Capture 
The results from screening and data collected during the study (except clinical laboratory test 
results) will be recorded via el ectronic source data collection . The study centers will use an 
electronic system to r ecord subject data. 
This protocol shall incorporate technology to capture source documents and source data 
electronically consistent with FDA Guidance for Industry “Computerized Systems Used in 
Clinical Investigations” ( May 2007) and FDA Guidance for Industry “Electronic Source Data in 
Clinical Investigations” ( September 2013 ). All electronic source documentation and data 
collected in this study shall “meet the same fundamental elemen ts of data quality (e.g. 
attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, and accurate)  that are expected of paper 
records.” 
Sites will use a tablet PC to di rectly record subject data and clinical observations on electronic 
forms with a similar look/feel/b ehavior as paper forms. This pe rmits the colle ction of both 
structured and unstructured infor mation including ad-hoc commen ts, drawings, and relevant 
clinical notes the investigativ e site deems impor tant. Informat ion to be originally captured and 
reviewed electronical ly shall include but not limited to the de tails of the subject visit, Medical 
History, Adverse Events, and Concomitant Medications. The eSource technology platform 
possesses the ability to immediat ely validate data, highlight r equired and dependent data fields, 
as well as to document discrepanc ies at the time the data is or iginally captured. Because this 
study is using an electronic sour ce record as the original poin t of data capture, there is no 
additional data entry step for t he site – rather, the electroni c source record dire ctly populates the 
study database. 
16.2. Study Monitoring 
This study will be monitored fro m initiation to completion by t he Sponsor or its representative. 
Monitoring will include personal visits and telephone communica tion to assure that the 
investigation is conducted according to protocol and in order t o comply with ICH GCP. 
16.3. Audits 
The study may be subject to audit by the Sponsor/designee. If such an audit occurs, the 
Investigator must agree to allo w access to required subject rec ords. This is dependent on the 
subject granting consent by signing the ICF. By signing this pr otocol, the Investigator grants 
permission to personnel from the Sponsor or i ts representatives  for on-site monitoring and

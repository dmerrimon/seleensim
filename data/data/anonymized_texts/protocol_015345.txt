VV-CLIN -000684  Part 1a Dose Escalation  
This is a standard 3+3  dose escalation of single agent INCB001158 in patients with 
advanced/metastatic solid tumors.  A minimum of three eligible solid tumor patients will be assigned 
to each dose level during the Dose Escalation period.  The starting dose of 50 mg BID was selected for 
the monotherapy dose escalation on the basis of GLP -compliant preclinical toxicity studie s.  The dose 
escalation schedule outlined below will be followed, which is based on the standard Modified 
Fibonacci design .  Real-time PK and pharmacodynamic assessment will be performed on samples 
taken during dose escalation.   
Part 1b D ose Escalation  
The decision to initiate the evaluation of the safety of INCB001158 in combination with 
pembrolizumab (Part 1b) will be made on the basis of PK, pharmacodynamic and safety data from 
patients enrolled in the monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1a) and/or monoth erapy expansion cohorts 
(Part 2).  Part 1b may be opened if one of the following is achieved at a dose level that is confirmed to 
be at or below the monotherapy MTD:  
• At least half of the patients (minimum of two patients) enrolled at a particular dose leve l 
achieve a trough (C min) plasma concentration of INCB001158 at steady state of ≥ 1 μM, OR  
• At least half of the patients (minimum of two patients) at a particular dose level achieve a 
2.5-fold increase in fasting plasma arginine at Cycle 1 Day 15 predose r elative to their baseline 
(Cycle 1 Day 1 predose) value.  
When the PK or PD requirement has been satisfied in Part 1a or Part 2 as defined above, the final 
decision to open Part 1b will be made by agreement between the Medical Monitor and the Study 
Investig ators.   
Part 1b is a standard 3+3 dose escalation design.  Upon opening Part 1b, a minimum of 3 patients will 
receive pembrolizumab (200 mg IV Q3W) in combination with INCB001158.  Enrollment in Part 1b is 
limited to patients  with tumor types  that would be eligible for the Expansion Cohorts in Part 3.  In 
Part 1b, the starting dose of INCB001158 will be 50 mg BID, which is 2 dose levels  below the 
recommended monotherapy Phase 2 dose of 100 mg BID identified in Part 1a of this study .  Dose 
escalation will proceed according to the Dose Escalation Schedule that is being employed in Part 1a in 
the table below.   A dose level shall not be enrolled in Part 1b until it has been demonstrated to be at or 
below the monotherapy MTD in Part 1a.

VV-CLIN -000684  Part 1c  Renal Impairment  Cohort  
At US sites only, Cohort 1c will enroll 6 patients who have moderately impaired renal func tion 
(defined as CrCl 30-49 mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft -Gault formula) AND meet eligibility 
criteria for any of the combination expansion cohorts (3a through 3h) .  Based on population PK 
modeling, a dose of 50  mg BID in patients with CrCl 30 -49 mL/min is predicted to achieve  
INCB001 158 AUC /Cmin values to fall within the known safe exposure range corresponding to doses at 
or below the established RP2D  of 100 mg BID .  Therefore, 6 patients me eting eligibility criteria for 
Parts 3a through 3h will be enrolled at  a reduced  dose of 50  mg BID in order to obtain full PK, PD, and 
safety data .  All data collected during the first cycle (21 days) will be evaluated , along with the  
population PK modeling data , to determine the INCB001158 dose in patients with moderately 
impaired renal function  that most closely approximates the PK parameters of the RP2D of 100  mg BID 
in patients with normal renal function .  Patients who do not complete all planned PK assessments or 
have treatment discontinuation or interruptions during the first 21 days of dosi ng will be replaced until 
6 evaluable patients have been accrued to the cohort.  Efficacy evaluable patients in Cohort 1c  who 
achieve the target exposure leading to continuous inhibition of extracellular arginase 1 by >  90% (C min 
of > 1 µM) and/or an eleva tion of fasting plasma arginine of > 2.5-fold at Cycle 1 Day 15 predose 
relative to  baseline  will be counted towards their respective Part 3 expansion cohorts , provided these 
have not fully enrolled at the time data from these patients become availa ble. 
Dose Escalation Rules and Definition of Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in the first 28 days of dosing for monotherapy dose 
escalation (Part 1a) or the first 42 days of dosing for combination dose escalation (Part 1b ) will be used 
to determine escalation to the next dose level.  The study is using a traditional 3+3 design and the dose 
escalation rules are as follows:  
• An initial cohort of 3 patients is enrolled.  
• If 0/3 patients develops a DLT, escalation to the next do se will occur.  
• If 1/3 patients develops a DLT:  
o Another 3 patients will be enrolled at this dose level.  
▪ If 0 of the 3 new patients develops a DLT (for a total of 1/6 patients with a 
DLT at this dose level), escalation to the next dose level will occur.  
▪ If ≥1 of the 3 new patients develops a DLT (for a total of ≥ 2/6 patients with a 
DLT at this dose level), the dose escalation stage of the trial will be 
terminated, and the dose directly below the current dose will be considered the 
MTD.  
• If ≥ 2/3 patients deve lop a DLT, the dose escalation stage of the trial will be terminated, and 
the dose directly below the current dose will be considered the MTD.  
If a dose level below 1000 mg BID is selected as the MTD on the basis of only 2 DLTs and subsequent 
clinical data  [e.g., in the expansion cohort(s)] demonstrate that the rate of AEs that qualify as DLTs at 
that dose level is < 10% in > 10 patients, re -escalation to the next dose level previously associated with 
DLTs may be considered.  If re -escalation occurs, up to 6 additional patients may be enrolled and the 
dose level may be considered tolerable if the overall DLT rate for that dose level is ≤ 25%.  
Part 2 Single Agent Cohort Expansion  
Following completion of monotherapy Dose Escalation and selection of the RP2D fo r INCB001158 in 
Part 1a, the following cohorts of patients will be enrolled to receive single agent INCB001158 at the 
RP2D.  
• Cohort 2a will enroll patients with advanced NSCLC . Enrollment to this cohort will follow a 
Simon 2 -stage design where the observed clinical activity in the first 11 patients will determine 
whether additional patients will be enrolled for a total of 26 patients.

VV-CLIN -000684  • Cohort 2b will enroll patients with advanced /metastatic  colorectal cancer . Enrollment to th is 
cohort will follow a Simon 2 -stage design where the observed clinical activity in the first 
11 patients will determine whether additional patients will be enrolled for a total of 26 patients.  
• Cohort 2c will initially enroll  30 patients with various other tumor types expected to have high 
infiltration with arginase positive cells. Up to 2 tumor types in Cohort 2c may then be 
expanded based on a Simon 2 -stage design, if the observed clinical activity ( 1 or more PR or 
CR in a tumor type with up to 11 patients ) supports enrollment of additional patients for a total 
of 26  patients per tumor type.  
• Cohort 2d will enroll patients at US sites only  who meet eligibility criteria for any of the 
monotherapy expansio n cohorts (2a, 2b, or 2c).  
 
 
 
 
Part 3 Combination Cohort Expansion   
Upon selection of the  RP2D for INCB001158 in combination with pembrolizumab in Part 1b, cohorts 
of specific patients will be enrolled to receive INCB001158 in combination with pembrolizumab at the 
RP2D to further evaluate safety and identify an early signal of clinical activit y.

Statistical Methods  
Sample Size Method  
The primary objective is to determine a dose level of INCB001158 , as monotherapy and in 
combination with pembrolizumab,  for which the rate of DLTs is less than 33%.  Up to a pproximately  
108 patients are planned for single agent dose escalation (Part  1a) and up to 108 patients for 
combination dose escalation (Part 1b).   
Part 1c is intended to enroll the minimum number of patients  required to generate sufficient PK data 
for a descriptive comparison of Day 1 and steady state  (Day 8, Day 15) exposures  between patients 
with moderate renal impairment (CrCl  30-49 m L/min) and norma l renal function (CrCl > 50 m L/min) .  
Accordingly, the sample size of 6 PK -evaluable patients for C ohort 1c  is not based on a predefined 
statistical analysis . 
In Part s 2a, 2b,  and 3, the sample size for each tumor type within a treatment group will be guided by 
the Simon 2 -stage design.  Part 2c is designed to investigate the potential for clinical activity in a 
variety of tumor types.  The sample size for the initial  30 patien ts was not based on a predefined 
statistical analysis .  The sample size for each tumor type in any subsequent expansion of Cohort 2c will 
be guided by a Simon 2 -stage design .

Each Simon 2 stage design will have a stopping rule to allow early termination of a particular tumor 
type within a treatment group at the end of Stage  1 if there is insufficient response observed, while 
enrolling enough patients to predict possible target res ponses worthy of cohort expansion and 
potentially further evaluation in future studies.  
The proposed designs for each tumor type will be used for a ny planned Simon 2 -stage design .  Each 
Simon 2 -stage design is set up to have a 1 -sided Type I error of 0.1 a nd power of 80%.  The response 
rates for each tumor type will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals.

Primary Analysis  
The following safety analyses will be assessed for all Patients  in each treatment combination:  
Adverse events (AEs) and changes in laboratory values, vital signs, and physical examinations . 
Secondary Analyses  
The following efficacy analyses will be assessed for all Patients  in each treatment combination:  
• Based on an evaluation of AEs, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and evidence of 
clinical activity.  
• Assessed by standard RECIST v1.1 criteria (except for pleural mesothelioma, which will be 
evaluated using modified RECIST criteria) [overall response rate (ORR), best overall response 
(BOR), duration of response (DOR), and p rogression -free survival (PFS)]  
• Non-compartmental method of analysis will be used to analyze the plasma concentration of

VV-CLIN -0006844.0 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THE TREA TMENT REGIMEN  
4.1 Potential Risks of INCB001158 Monotherapy and its Combination with 
Pembrolizumab  
The potential risks of INCB001158, pembrolizumab and the combination of INCB001158 with 
pembrolizumab are outlined in detail in Section 12.1 of the protocol. 
4.2 P oten tial Benefit of INCB001158 and its Combination with Pembrolizumab 
Since INCB001158 is an experimental therapy, it is not known if it will be of benefit to patients.  
Based on what is known about the expression of Arginase in cancers and the immunosuppressive 
effect of Arginase, though the depletion of arginine, it is hypothesized that the inhibition of 
Arginase will result in an increase in local and systemic arginine levels, which may reverse 
Arginase-induced immunosuppression.  By reversing immunosuppressi on, an anti-tumor 
immune response may re
activated in patients, either as a monot herapy or in combination with 
anti-PD-1 therapy (e.g., pembrolizumab).

VV-CLIN -0006845.1 Part 1. Dose Escalation 
Part 1a of this Phase 1 study will begin with a standard, open-label, 3+3 dose-escalating design 
of single age nt INCB001158 in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.  Dose escalation 
will continue until identification of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or to a planne d maximum 
daily dose of 2000 m g o
rally [i.e., 1000 mg twice daily (BID)].  Dose escal ati on may continue 
beyond 2000 mg daily based on emerging clinica l data.  Escalation will be limited by a 
maximum pharmacokinetic (P K) threshold based on the exposure at the highest well tolerated 
doses in GLP-compliant toxicity studies (see Section  10.2.2 for further details). 
After achieving a pre
defined threshol d PK targe t exposure of INCB001158 and/or clear evidence 
of pharmacodynamic activity (i.e., elevated plasma arginine ) during single agent escalation of 
INCB001158, the safety and tolerability of INCB001158 will be evaluated in combination with 
the anti- PD-1 age nt pembrolizumab in a separa te dose escalation (Part 1b).  Pembrolizumab will 
be administered at the dose of 200 mg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks.  Only dose levels of 
INCB001158 that have already been demonstrated to be safe as a monot herapy will be tested in 
combination with pembrolizumab.  
Part 1a. INCB001158 Monotherapy Dose Escalation 
Sequential dose esca lation of sing le agent INCB001158 will take place in patients with 
advanced/metastatic solid tumors.  A minimum of three eligible solid tumor patients will be 
assigned to each dose level during the Dose Escalation period.  
Dose escalation plan:  The starting dose of 50 mg BID was selected for the monotherapy dose 
escalation on the basis of GLP-compliant preclinical toxicity studies (see Section  10.2.1).  The 
dose 
escalati on schedule outlined in Ta ble 5.1-1 wil l be followed, which is based on the standard 
Modified Fibonacci design. Real-time PK and pharmacodynamic assessment will be performed 
on samples taken during dose escalation.

VV-CLIN -000684Part 1b. INCB001158 Dose Escalation in Combinati on with Pembrolizumab  
The decisi on  to initiate the evaluation of the safety of INCB001158 in combination with 
pembrolizumab (Part 1b) will be made on the basis of PK, pharmacodynamic and safety data 
(see Section  10.2.1) from patients enrolled in the monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1a) and/
or monotherapy expansion cohorts (Part 2).  Part 1b may be opene d if one of the following is 
achieve d at a dose level t
hat is confirmed to be a t or below the monotherapy MTD: 
1.At least half of the patients (minimum of two patients) enrolled at a partic ular dose level
achieve a trough (C min) plasma concentration of INCB001158  at steady state  of ≥ 1 µM,
OR
2.At least half of the patients (minimum of two patients) at a particular dose level achieve a
2.5-fold increase in fasting plasma arginine at  Cycle 1 Day 15 predose  relative to the ir
baseline  (Cycle 1 Day 1 predose ) value .
When the PK or PD requirement has been satisfied in Part 1 a or Part 2  as defined above, t he final 
decision to open Part 1b  will be made by agreement between the Medical Monitor and th e Study 
Investigators.   
Upon opening Part 1b, a  minimum of 3 patients will receive  pembrolizumab  (200 mg IV Q3W) 
in combination with INCB001158 .  Enrollment in Part 1b is limited to patients that would be 
eligible for the Expansion Cohorts in Part 3.   In Part 1b, t he starting  dose of INCB001158  will be 
50 mg BID, which is 2 dose levels  below the recommended monotherapy Phase 2 dose of 
100 mg BID identified in Part 1a of this study .  Dose escalation  will proceed according to the 
Dose Escalation Schedule tha t is being employed in Part 1a ( Table 5.1-1).  A dose level shall not 
be enrolled in Part 1b until it has been demonstrated to be at or below the monotherapy  MTD  in 
Part 1a .   
Part 1c. INCB001158 in Combination with Pembrolizum ab in Patients with Moderately 
Impaired Renal Function  
At US sites only, Cohort 1c will enroll 6 patients  who have  moderately  impaired renal function 
(defined as CrCl 30-49 mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft -Gault formula) AND meet eligibility 
criteria for any of the combination expansion cohorts (3a through 3h).  The safety of 
INCB001158 in combination with pembrolizumab was fully characterized with a comprehensive 
dose escalation  in patients with CrCl  > 50 mL /min.  Additionally, pembrolizumab did not have

10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
CONFIDENTIAL  34 
VV-CLIN -000684any effect on the PK of INCB 001158.  Therefore, Cohort 1c will evaluate a reduced dose of 
INCB 001158 50 mg BID (determined using popul ation PK mode ling) in combination with 
pembrolizumab in order to determine a pharmacodynamically active dose in patients with 
moderately impaired rena l function.  
Based on population PK modeling, a dose of INCB 01158 50 mg BID in patients with CrCl 30 to 
49 mL/min is predicted to achieve INCB 001158 AUC/C min values to fall withi n the known sa fe 
exposure range corresponding to doses at the established RP2D of 100 mg BID (see 
Section  10.2).  Six patients meeting eligibility criteria for Parts 3a through 3h will be enrolled at 
the reduced dose of 50 mg BID  to obtain full PK, PD (see Attachment 2C ), and safety data.  All 
data collected during the first cycle (21 days) wil l be evaluated, along with the population PK 
modeling data, to determine the INCB001158 dose in patients wi th moderately impaire d renal 
function that most closely approximates the PK parameters of the RP2D of 100 mg BID in 
patients with normal renal function and specifically meets the following PK and PD criteria: 
•At least half of the patients (minimum of 2 patients) achieve the target exposure leading
to continuous inhibition of extracellular arginase 1 by > 90% ( a trough [Cmin] plasma
concentration of INCB001158 at steady state of ≥ 1 μM ), AND/ OR
•At least half of the patients (minimum of 2 patients) achieve a 2.5 -fold increase in fasting
plasma arginine at Cycle 1 Day 15 predose relative to their baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1
predose) value.
Population PK modeling showed a highly predictable, linear, inverse relationship between CrCl 
and AUC, C max, and half-life for INCB001158 (see Section  10.2.2.1).  Therefore, if the PK -PD 
criteria specified above are not met at the 50 mg BID dose, population PK modeling will be used 
to determine whether a lower dose (25 mg BID) or a previously evaluated intermediate dose 
(75 mg BID) would more closely approximate PK parameters for the established RP2D of 
100 mg BID.  Cohort 1c patients who do not complete all planne d PK assessments or have 
treatment discontinuation or interruptions during the first 21 days of dosing will be replaced until 
6 evaluable patients have been accrued to the cohort.  Patients meeting the pre-specified PK and 
PD criteria will be counted towa rds the Simon 2-stage efficacy assessment in their respective 
Pa
rt 3 expansion cohorts, provided these have not fully enrolled at the time data from these 
patients become available.

CONFIDENTIAL  35 
VV-CLIN -000684  5.1.1 Dose Escalation Rules  and Definition of Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed in the first 28 days of dosing  for monotherapy dose 
escalation  (Part 1a ) or the first 42 days of dosing for combination dose escalation (Part 1b) will 
be used to determine escalation to the next dose level.  The stu dy is using a traditional 3+3 
design and the dose escalation rules are as follows:  
• An initial cohort of 3 patients is enrolled.  
• If 0/3 patients develops a DLT, escalation to the next dose will occur.  
• If 1/3 patients develops a DLT:  
o Another 3 patients will be enrolled at this dose level.  
▪ If 0 of the 3 new patients develops a DLT (for a total of 1/6 patients  with a 
DLT at this dose level), escalation to the next dose level will  occur.  
▪ If ≥ 1 of the 3 new patients develops a DLT (for a total of ≥ 2/6 patients  
with a DLT at this dose level), the dose escalation stage of the trial  will be  
terminated, and the dose directly below the current dose will be  considered 
the MTD.  
• If ≥ 2/3 patients  develop a DLT, the dose escalation stage of the trial will be  terminated , 
and the dose directly below the current dose will be considered the  MTD.  
 
If a dose level below 1000 mg  BID is selected as the MTD on the basis of only 2 DLTs and 
subsequent clinical data [e.g., in the expansion cohort(s) ] demonstrate that the rate of AE s that 
qualify as DLTs at that dose level is <  10% in >  10 patients, re -escalation to the next dose level 
previously associated with DLTs may be considered.  If re -escalation occurs, up to 6 additional 
patients may be enrolled and the dose level may be considered tolerable if the overall DLT rate 
for that dose level is ≤ 25%.  
5.1.2 Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
During dose escalation , patients must receive at least 75% of the planned INCB001158  
administrations (Parts 1a and 1b) and two doses of pembrolizumab (Part 1b only) in the DLT 
evaluation window to be considered evaluable for DLT, unless the patient has a DLT or has the 
study tr eatment  held for an adverse event (AE) that may herald a DLT.   The DLT evaluation 
window will be the first 28 days (Part 1a) or the first 42 days (Part 1b) on study, starting from 
Cycle 1  Day 1 (C1D1).   Patients who discontinue the study during the DLT eva luation window  
prior to receiving the requisite study treatment administrations for reasons that include, but are 
not limited to, clinical/radiographic progression, voluntary withdrawal, or complications that the

evaluable for DLT and will be replaced.   In addition to DLTs, a pharmacokinetic threshold of 
100 µg*hr/ mL is included as a dose -limiting event.  This is an exposure that was well tolerated 
in preclinical s pecies and exceeds the expected efficacious exposure by 14-fold. 
During Part 1b, i t is likely that Grade 3 AEs associated with pembrolizumab administration will 
occur and , given the small sample size of cohorts , this could occur by chance in 2 of 6 patient s, 
the usual threshold for unacceptable toxicity.  It will be important to differentiate between 
immune -related adverse events (irAEs) expected from pembrolizumab toxicity as opposed to an 
increase in frequency or a worsening of severity of irAEs as an ind icator of unacceptable toxicity 
related to the combination.   Dose escalation cohorts can be expanded up to 12 patients if DLTs 
occur that are expected pembrolizumab -related irAEs per the pembrolizumab product label.  
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adv erse Events (CTCAE v4.03) will be used to identify 
and classify toxicities arising during the study .  The occurrence of any of the following toxicities 
during Cycle 1 will be considered a DLT, if judged by the Investigator to be related (possibly or 
probably) to administration of either or both study treatment (s): 
Non- Hematologic  DLT s: 
• Any ≥ Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity  
• Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity lasting > 3 days despite optimal supportive care  with 
the exception of:  
o Grade 3 fatigue  lasting ≤ 7 days  
o Grade 3 rash that resolves to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 weeks  
o Grade 3 tumor flare (defined as local pai n, irritation or rash localized at sites of 
known or suspected tumor)  
o Grade 3 irAE that resolves to Grade 1 with corticosteroid therapy in ≤ 3 weeks  
(Part 1b ONLY)  
o A transient (resolves within 6 hr of onset) Grade 3 infusion -related AE  (Part 1b

Rationale for urinary orotic ac id threshold 
Urinary OA is being monitored in this study as a sensitive biomarker of hepatic urea cycle 
inhibition.  Substantial elevations (generally to 100-800X the upper limit of normal) occur in 
patients with inherited defects in enzymes of the urea cycle.  A similar magnitude of OA 
elevation (~1000X) wa s noted in animals that received doses associated with toxicity in 
INCB001158  Protocol INCB 01158 -101 
10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
CONFIDENTIAL  38 
VV-CLIN -000684preclinical safety studi es, although notable elevations in urinary OA were also noted in some 
animals treated at the NOAEL ( Figure 10.1-6). 
Due to the limited availability of data describing the clinical sequelae associated with modest 
(5-100X U LN) elevations of urinary OA, a threshold of 5X the ULN was sele cted to provide 
clear evidence of urea cycle inhibition.  Importantly, elevations i n urinary OA are not considered 
a toxicity but, rathe r, 
serve as a biom arker of urea cy cle function.  In addition to urinary OA, 
patients are also monitored for sustained elevations in ammonia or significant reductions in 
plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN ) as signs of clinically significant effec ts on the urea cycle. 
There has been no evidence of clinically significant urea cycle inhibition to date.  However, as 
described in Section  10.1.9, transient, reversible elevations in urinary OA have occurred in two 
patients enrolled at the 150 mg dose level.  These elevations were as high a s 11.6 and 
9.3 µmol/mmol creatinine (7.7X and 6.2X the ULN, respectively) in the two patients when 
evaluated predose (fasting).  When tested 6 hr postdose (non-fasted), one of the two patients had 
elevated values, which were as high as 131 µmol/mmol creatinine (87.3X ULN).  As described 
in Section  10.1.9, these patients were asymptomatic and had no laboratory evidence of clinically 
significant urea cycle inhibition.   
Since this protocol was first written, addition al literature sources have been identified in which 
elevation of urinary OA have been studied in healthy people who are carriers of a single urea 
cycle gene defect (UCD).  In one study, 24 individuals that were carriers of a single defective 
gene for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) were studie d (Nagasaka 2013 ).  These individuals 
were considered healthy without clinical evidence of urea cycle dysfunction.  Fasting urina ry OA 
was elevate d in all of these individuals, with a mean level of 11 µmol /mmol creatinine that 
ranged from 5 to 23 µmol/mmol creatinine.  I n addition, other studies in similar populations of 
healthy individuals wit h a 
known or presumed single defe ctive urea cycle gene have 
demonstrated that urinary OA elevates significantly followin g a meal (due to the increa sed 
processing of ammonia by the liver following a protein meal), as compared to normal individuals 
with a fully intact urea cycle in whom there is a minimal change in urinary OA following a meal.  
Following a meal, the urinary OA in these healthy UCD carriers rose as high as 62 µmol/mmol 
creatinine ( Goldstein 1974 ). 
Based on the clinical experience to date with INCB001158 and the more extensive literature 
evidence of elevations in urinary OA in healthy UCD, the management of elevated urinary OA 
INCB001158  Protocol INCB 01158 -101 
10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  39 
VV-CLIN -000684  has been updated in the protocol.  Given the variability of  urinary  OA following a meal in 
healthy UCD carriers, separate thresholds have been defined for fasting patients (i.e., patients 
tested predose) versus those that have eaten (i.e., patients tested 6  hr postdose).  In addition, 
since urinary OA elevations may be variable and have not been associated with evidence of 
clinically significant urea cycle inhibition, re -testing  of urinary OA while the patient continues to 
receive INCB001158 is recom mended  in patients that have no evidence of clinically significant 
urea cycle inhibition (i.e., asymptomatic, plasma ammonia/BUN  without significant change from 
baseline)  in order to confirm that the elevation was not spurious .  For elevations of urinary OA of 
> 15 µmol/mmol creatinine (>10X ULN) in fasting patients, dose reduction is recommended.  
This value is within the range of urinary OA elevations that are were seen in the cohort of 
24 healthy UCD carriers tested while fasting in Nagasaka et al (2013 ).  For patients that are not 
fasting, higher elevations can be expected, based on the elevations in UCD carriers following a 
meal.  Therefore, for elevations of urinary OA of >  60 µmol/mmol creatinine (40X ULN) at any 
time, d ose reduction is recommended.   
In summary, there has been no evidence of clinically significant inhibition of the urea cycle to 
date.  Two patients have had asymptomatic transient elevations in urinary OA, a sensitive 
biomarker of hepatic urea cycle inhib ition, that were not associated with changes in plasma 
ammonia or BUN, but were dose reduced based on the original  protocol defined  urinary  OA 
threshold of 5X ULN.  Based on this clinical experience and a more extensive evaluation of the 
published data in healthy carriers of UCD genes, the approach to managing INCB001158 study 
drug in response to elevations in urinary OA has been changed in the current amendment.  All of 
these data and the current management approach ha ve been reviewed by an external clinic al 
expert in the management of patients with UCD  .

VV-CLIN -000684  5.1.3 Definition  of Recommended Phase 2 Dose (R P2D) 
The RP2D for INCB001158  both as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab will 
be selected on the basis of emerging safety, PK and pharmacodynamic data and will not exceed 
the maximally tolerate d dose (MTD).  The RP2D will either be the MTD or a lower dose if PK, 
pharmacodynamic , tolerability and efficacy data suggest that maxim al efficacy is likely  achieved 
at a dose below the MTD , particularly if the lower dose is associated with an improved safety 
profile.    
5.2 Part  2. Single Agent Cohort  Expansion  
Following completion of monotherapy Dose Escalation  and selection of the RP2D  for 
INCB001158  in Part 1a, the following cohorts of patients will be enrolled to receive single agent 
INCB001158  at the RP2D.  
Part 2a : Monotherapy  Cohort  Expansion  in NSCLC  patients  
This expansion cohort will enroll patients with advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC ) that lack activating mutations  in either  the EGFR or ALK oncogenes and have 
received , declined,  or are ineligible for standard of care ( SOC ) therapies.  A Simon’s two -stage 
design will test the null hypothesis that the ORR ≤ 0.02 versus the alternative that ORR ≥  0.15.  
A minimum of 11 patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC will receive INCB001158  in 
Stage  1 of the expansion.  If at least 1 of the 11 response -evaluable patients respond s (PR or 
better) at a single time point in Stage 1, then an additional 15 evaluable patients (for a total of 
26 response -evaluable patients) will be enrolled in Stage 2.  
Part 2b : Monotherapy  Cohort Expansion in CRC patients  
This expansion cohort will enroll patients with advanced/metastatic color ectal cancer ( CRC ) that 
have received , declined,  or are ineligible for SOC therapies.  A Simon’s two -stage design will 
test the null hypothesis that the ORR ≤ 0.0 2 versus the alternative that ORR ≥  0.15.  A minimum 
of 11 CRC patients will receive  INCB001158  in Stage 1 of  the expansion.  If at least 1 of the 
11 response -evaluable patients respond s (PR or better) at a single time point in Stage 1, then an 
additional 15 evaluable patients (for a total of 26 response -evaluable patients) will be enrolle d in 
Stage 2.

VV-CLIN -000684  Many tumor types have infiltrating granulocytic myeloid -derived suppressor cells ( G-MDSCs) or 
neutrophils.  This expansion cohort will enroll patients with  a variety of  advanced/metastatic 
cancers that have received , declined,  or are ineligible for SOC therapies  that are among tumor 
types that have been demonstrated to have infiltrating G -MDSCs or neutrophils , includ ing 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN ), renal cell cancer (RCC), gastric or 
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, urothelial cell  cancer  (UCC) , and melanoma .  Other 
tumor types may be enrolled with approval from the Sponsor and the Medi cal Monitor.   A 
maximum of 30  patients will be enrolled initially in this cohort, with no more than 11 patients for 
any particular tumor type.  Up to 2 tumor types in Cohort 2c may then be expanded based on a 
Simon 2 -stage design, if the observed clinical activity ( 1 or more PR or CR in a tumor type with 
up to 11 patients) supports enrollment of additional patients for a total of 26  patients per tumor  
type.  
Part 2d:    
Cohort 2d will enroll patients at US  sites only who meet eligibility criteria for any of the 
monotherapy expansion cohorts (2a, 2b, or 2c).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cohort 2d patients may be counted towards the total number of patients planned in cohorts 2a,

therapy  (confirmed progression per iRECIST criteria preferred) , OR 
2. Ongoing prolonged stable disease (>  24 weeks)  on pembrolizumab therapy in the 
immedia te prior line  of therapy  
EGFR -mutant  and ALK -mutant  NSCLC  patients have been excluded because they are reported 
to be less responsive to anti-PD-1 therapy  (Borghaei  2015 ).

VV-CLIN -0006848.0 RADIOLOGICAL TUMOR ASSESSMENTS  
As part of  Protocol Amendment 2 -US 3, dated 10 NOV  2020 , the irRECIST  endpoints have 
been  removed .  This Section refers to the radiological tumor assessments before Protocol 
Amendment 2 -US 3.  
All patients will be evaluated for tumor response both according to Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors ( RECIST) version 1.1  (see Attachment  4) [in mesothelioma  patients,  modified 
RECIST criteria for pleural mesothelioma ( Byrne 2004 , Attachment 5)] and according to the 
immune -related response criteria using unidimensional measurements (irRECIST ; Perrone 2016 , 
see Attachment 6).  The irRECIST guidelines  are based on RECIST , immune -related response 
criteria and the findings in Nishino (2013) as described below.  Although the primary endpoint 
for analysis of clinical activity is RECIST  v1.1, patient management will follow the principles 
and guidelines that are  specifically outlined in the irRECIST criteria  (Attachment  6).  On-study 
assessments by irRECIST take into account the observation that some patients with solid tumors 
can have a transient tumor flare in the first few months after start of immunotherapy with 
subsequent dise ase response.  Clinical decisions will be based on the interpretation of the 
Investigator at the site treating the patient in real time using the irRECIST  criteria.  RECIST  
imaging analyses will be performed by the local radiologists and images may be coll ected and 
held in order to enable fut ure independent image analysis.  
If imaging shows progressive disease  per RECIST  v1.1, it is at the discretion of the investigator 
to keep a patient on study treatment or to stop study treatment until imaging is repeated  
approximately 4 weeks later in order to confirm PD, as described in the irRECIST 
recommendations  (see Attachment 6).  
Patients that are deemed clinically unstable or who have biopsy -proven new metastatic lesions 
are not req uired to have repeat imaging for confirmation.  This decision will be based on clinical 
judgment of a patient’s overall clinical condition, including performance status, clinical 
symptoms, and laboratory data.  At a minimum, patients must meet the followin g criteria for 
continued treatment on study after disease progression is identified at a tumor assessment:  
•Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values) indicating
disease progression
•No decline in ECOG performance status

CONFIDENTIAL  59 
VV-CLIN -000684  • Abse nce of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical 
sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.  
In general, i f repeat imaging confirms PD  as described in Attachment 6, patients will be 
discontinued from study therapy.   However, i f a patient  has confirmed  radiographic progression , 
but the patient  is achieving a clinically meaningful benefit, and there is no further increase in the 
tumor burden at the confirmatory tumor imaging, an exception to continue study treatment may 
be considered following consultation with the Medical Monitor.  If repeat im aging does not 
confirm PD, treatment with study treatment s will continue/resume and the next imaging studies 
will be conducted every 8 weeks  for parts 1a and 2 or every 9 weeks for parts 1b and 3  as 
previously scheduled.  In patients who discontinue study therapy early without documented 
disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by 
radiologic imaging.

10.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
10.1 Background  
10.1.1  Immunosuppressive  Myeloid Cells and Arginase  
Solid tumors have been shown to have moderate to extensive infiltration of immunosuppressive 
myeloid cells (Solito 2014 ).  Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs) and neutrophils are 
present in multiple solid tumors and correlate with poor outcome ( Gentles  2015 ).  Both 
granulocytic MDSCs and neutrophils contain the enzyme arginase within sec retory granules .  
Upon stimulation by factors within the tumor microenvironment [e.g., Interleukin -8 (IL -8) and 
tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α)], arginase is released into the tumor microenvironment via 
degranulation resulting in substantial depletion of the amino acid arginine, itself a critical factor 
in the proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T -cells and NK -cells.  Antitumor activity has been 
reported in mice when arginase is knocked out in the myeloid lineage in mice ( Colegio  2014 ). 
INCB001158  is a small molecule inhibitor of arginase that is able to restore the local tumor 
concentration of arginine, resulting in the re -activation of quiescent T - and NK -cells.  
INCB001158  has no direct growth inhibitory or cytotoxic activity on tumor cells or on immune 
effector cells.  
Two isoforms of arginase are found in the body.  Arginase 1 (gene symbol: ARG1) is a 
cytoplasmic enzyme that is highly expressed in the liver and is a critic al enzyme in the urea 
cycle.  Arginase 1 is also expressed by granulocytic myeloid cells (MDSCs and neutrophils) and 
is localized in secretory granules within these cell types.  A separate gene encodes arginase 2 
(gene symbol: ARG2), a mitochondrial enzyme  that is more widely expressed across cell types.  
INCB001158  is a competitive inhibitor of both recombinant human arginase 1 and arginase 2 
with IC 50s of approximately 100 and 275 nM, respectively.

VV-CLIN -000684  10.1.2  Arginase 1 Expression  in Cancer Patients  
In cancer pati ents, arginase in the tumor microenvironment is expressed by myeloid cells which 
release arginase from intracellular granules into the extracellular milieu following stimulation.  
Arginase is released from fully differentiated neutrophils/polymorphonuclear  cells (PMNs) 
and/or from granulocytic MDSCs which are immature neutrophils.  These granulocytic cells 
degranulate and release arginase into the extracellular space when stimulated by factors produced 
by the tumor (e.g., IL -8, TNF -α). 
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of tumor microarrays from multiple histotypes revealed 
that tumor cells themselves generally did not stain positive for arginase 1.  Instead, large 
numbers of infiltrating polymorphonuclear cells containing arginase 1 wer e found across many 
histotypes with the greatest frequency in lung, colorectal, gastri c, and bladder cancers 
(Figure  10.1-1).  The positive arginase 1 IHC staining in tumor microarrays in this study was 
largely confined to po lymorphonuclear cells based on morphology.  
In addition to the high arginase 1 observed by IHC in tumor -infiltrating granulocytic myeloid 
cells, analysis of plasma from cancer patients across multiple histotypes demonstrated elevated 
arginase 1 protein leve ls and lower arginine levels compared to normal he althy control patient s 
(Figure 1 0.1-1[B,C] ).  It has been hypothesized that arginase released from myeloid cells  in the 
tumor microenvironment can be recovered in plasma which may account  for the elevated 
arginase 1 protein levels and lower arginine levels measured systemically.

10.1.3  Selectivity  of INCB001158  
INCB001158  is a potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of human recombinant arginase 1 and 
2 (IC 50’s of 100 and 275 nM, respectively) .  INCB001158  is also able to inhibit the elevated 
arginase activity present in the plasma of renal cancer patients wi th a similar potency.  To assess 
selectivity, t he compound was evaluated as an inhibitor of radioligand binding to a panel of 
87 receptors and ion channels screened at a high concentration of 50 µM, well above the 
estimated 2 –3 µM C max of INCB001158  in hum ans at the proj ected efficacious dose .  
Two targets showed > 50% binding in these assays.  The enzyme cholinesterase showed 59% 
binding inhibition at 50 µM, although there were no clinical observations in mice, rats, or 
monkeys consistent with cholinestera se inhibition in vivo  despite achieving a C max of > 100 µM 
in mice and rats and > 80 µM in monkeys.  There was also 63% inhibition of ligand binding to 
the dopamine transporter at 50 µM.   It should be noted that INCB001158  has limited brain 
penetration as measured in mice and rats.

VV-CLIN -000684  No inhibition of the arginine -utilizing nitric oxide synthase family of enzymes (eNOS, iNOS, 
and nNOS) was measured at 50 µM INCB001158  and no inhibition was seen in a panel of 
5 serine proteases at the same concentration.  
10.1.4  Activ ity of INCB001158  in Cell -Based Assays  
Activated T -cells and NK -cells require the amino acid arginine to proliferate. Arginine is 
metabolized in the tumor environment by arginase that has been secreted from MDSCs and 
neutrophils ( Munder 200 5).  Arginine depletion leads to a suppression of T -cell and NK -cell 
proliferation thereby blunting the anti -tumor immune response.  
INCB001158  had no direct anti -proliferative activity on cell lines in culture, includ ing human 
HepG2 or murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cell lines.  Furthermore, INCB001158  did not 
inhibit the growth rate of normal human T -cells or NK -cells that were isolated and stimulated in 
culture.  However, INCB001158  did reverse the growth suppress ive effects of human neutrophils 
on human T -cells when co -cultured ex vivo  with an EC50 of 162 nM as shown in Figure 1 0.1-2.  
Similarly, INCB001158 reversed inhibition of T -cell growth by patient -derived MDSCs with 
similar po tency.  In both cases, INCB001158  was able to antagonize the depletion of arginine 
mediated by neutrophils or MDSCs in a dose -dependent fashion.

VV-CLIN -000684  10.1.5  Immunosuppression by Argina se in Mice Versus  Humans  
Arginase is an immunosuppressive enzyme in mice and humans that limi ts the availability of 
extracellular arginine to T -cells in the tumor microenvironment.  MDSCs participate in the 
immunosuppressive process in both species; however, the biology of MDSCs is fundamentally 
different between mice and humans.  In mice, arginas e and the arginine transporter are 
upregulated in MDSCs, leading to rapid uptake of arginine from the extracellular milieu and 
subsequent cleavage by arginase intracellularly.  In contrast, in humans, arginine is cleaved by 
extracellular arginase secreted  by MDSCs and neutrophils.  INCB001158  inhibition of cellular 
arginase  in mouse MDSCs is limited by poor cellular penetration.  Thus,  the anti -tumor efficacy 
of INCB001158  in mouse syngeneic tumor models requires higher doses than those anticipated 
for effi cacy in humans and may in large part be mediated by the ability of INCB001158  to 
elevate systemic arginine levels, a pharmacodynamic effect.  
10.1.6  Pharmacodynamics  of INCB001158  in Tumors and Tissues in Mice  
The tumor distribution and pharmacodynamic effects of INCB001158  were  evaluated in mice 
bearing subcutaneously -implanted murine Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) tumors  2 hr after 
treatment with a single dose or 2 hr after the last of five doses administered on a twice daily 
(BID) schedule .  Plasma and tumor concent rations of both INCB001158  and the 
pharmacodynamic marker arginine were determined in these studies  (Figure 1 0.1-3).  Significant 
exposure to INCB001158  in plasma and tumors was observed after a single dose that was 
moderatel y higher after five doses on the BID schedule.  With 250 mg/kg dosing, the 
concentration of arginine in plasma increased about 3 -fold 2 hr after a single oral dose and 
almost 8 -fold 2 hr after five doses on a BID schedule.   INCB001158  accumulated approxima tely 
2-fold in tumors following a BID schedule, while arginine in tumor s increased by more than 
3-fold.  Studies looking at arginine and INCB001158  levels in plasma and tumors after BID 
dosing for 14 days showed similar levels of both INCB001158  and argini ne indicating 
steady -state was reached within 3 days.

10.1.7  Efficacy  of INCB001158  in Tumor -Bearing Syngeneic Mice  
Oral BID administration of s ingle agent INCB001158  produced a dose-dependent  reduction in 
the growth of s ubcutaneously implanted LLC tumors with significant activity  at doses as low as 
10 mg/kg (Figure 1 0.1-4[A]).  A dose -related systemic increase in the plasma concentration of 
arginine correlated with this efficacy ( Figure 1 0.1-4[B]).  The efficacy of INCB001158  in LLC 
tumors is immune -mediated.  When LLC tumors were grown in immuno -compromised scid 
mice, there was no anti -tumor activity of INCB001158 ; furthermore, depleting antibodies that 
target CD8+ T-cells or NK -cells partially reverse the effect of INCB001158 in immune -
competent animals ( Figure 1 0.1-4[C,D]) .  Changes in tumor growth rate in the mouse LLC 
model were associated  with increases in CD8+ T cells within the tumor ( Figure 1 0.1-4[E]), 
consistent with an immune stimulatory mechanism of action.

10.1.8  Nonclinical Toxicity Testing of INCB001158  
INCB001158  is well tolerated in all specie s at doses that produce robust pharmacodynamic 
effects.  There is a substantial  safety margin of ≥  16-fold from the projected clinical efficacious 
exposure (AUC and C max) to the exposures that were well tolerated in the GLP toxicology 
studies in rats and monkeys.  
Very high doses and exposures can result in the on -target toxicity of urea cycle inhibition 
associated with morbidity.  The strongest evidence of urea cycle toxicity was identified in 
non-GLP studies in mice, where a thorough time course of plasma  and liver arginine could be 
monitored along with plasma ammonia .  Animals receiving very high doses of INCB001158 that 
caused mortality, showed dose -related increases in the plasma concentration of arginine and 
ammonia, large increases in liver arginine, and reduced serum BUN.  These findings occurred at 
exposures >  45-fold and >  150-fold over the AUC and C max projected to be needed to achieve 
efficacy in humans, respectively.  
A dose of 500 mg/kg BID (10 00 mg/kg/day) in the rat 28-day GLP toxicity study , produced  a 
steady -state peak exposure  (Cmax) of > 62 µg/mL (216 µM ) and an AUC o- of > 283 µg*hr/mL ,   
> 78-fold and >  40-fold above the projected human efficac ious exposure , respectively .  This dose 
resulted in mortality in 29% of rats  that was associated with clear evidence of  urea cycle

VV-CLIN -000684  inhibition including a large elevation in liver arginine, elevated plasma ammonia and sporadic 
decreases in BUN.   Additionally, modest increases (<  2-fold) in alanine (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransfera se (AST)  as well as  slight to moderate atrophy of the bone marrow, slight to 
moderate cytoplasmic clearing of the pars distalis of the pituitary gland, and non -adverse 
minimal to moderate h epatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation  were observed in the high dos e 
animals, all of which were reversible following a two -week non -dosing recovery period.  The 
dose of 150 mg BID (300 mg/kg/day) in rats did not result in adverse findings over 28 days and 
therefore was considered the NOAEL .  The AUC and C max in rats at st eady -state at the NOAEL 
are expected to be at least  16- and 30 -fold, respectively, over those projected to be efficacious  in 
humans.   Minimal  histological findings  were observed in the liver  (vacuolation)  and pituitary 
gland  (cytoplasmic clearing)  of rats receiving 300 mg/kg/day INCB001158  that were not 
considered adverse and were fully reve rsible following a two -week non -dosing recovery  period.  
In the 28 -day GLP toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, INCB001158  dosing at 150 mg/kg 
BID (300 mg/kg/day) resulted in morbidity in one female monkey .  Findings in this animal were 
consistent with urea cycle inhibition with ~120 -fold increase in liver arginine .  A dose of 
300 mg/kg/day in male monkeys was generally well -tolerated, as was a dose of 200 mg/kg/day in 
female monkeys .  Findings in surviving high -dose animals included  reversible  ~2-fold elevations 
in ALT and AST correlating with minimal centrilobular hepatocyte degeneration, as well as 
modest decreases in total  protein and albumin .  At the high dose, the steady -state Cmax was 
> 23 µg/mL  (80 µM)  and the AUC was >  137 µg*hr/mL , over 29 -fold and 19 -fold above the 
projected human efficacious  exposure, respectively .  A dose level of 50 mg/kg BID 
(100 mg/kg/day) in ma le and female monkeys did not result in any adverse findings and was 
considered the NOAEL .  The dose level of 100 mg/kg BID (200 mg/kg/day) was considered the 
Highest Non -Severely Toxic Dose (HNSTD) .  The AUC and C max in monkeys at steady -state at 
this dos e are expected to be at least 16 - and 24 fold, respectively, above the exposure predicted 
to be efficacious in humans.  
A Functional Observational Battery and Locomotor Assessment were incorporated into the rat 
GLP toxicity study to evaluate any potential CNS effects.  There were no findings in either 
evaluation that were attributed to INCB001158 .  In the GLP cynomolgus monkey  study, ECG 
and blood pressure were monitored.  There were no findings associated with INCB001158

Orotic acid  (OA)  is a marker of urea cycle inhibition that accumulates in the urine in patients 
with urea cycle defects.   In rats, a single dose of 500 mg/kg (the dose that produced significant 
toxicity during the second week of BID dosin g in the GLP toxicity study) produced a dramatic 
increase in urine OA (> 1000 -fold; Figure 1 0.1-6).  Notably, in one rat receiving the NOAEL 
dose of 150 mg/kg an increase in OA of ~100 -fold was observed.   Thus, urine OA is a sensitive 
surrogate marker for urea cycle inhibition and will be monitored closely in patients on the 
Phase  1 clinical study.

10.1.10  Pharmacokinetics  of INCB001158  
Administration of INCB001158 to so lid tumor patients resulted in  pharmacologically active  
exposure beginning with the first dose of 50 mg.  The first three d ose escalation  cohorts enrolled 
patients at  doses of 50 , 100, and 150 mg BID.  The pharmacokinetic data available  as of 
26 June 2017 are shown in Figure 1 0.1-7 and PK parameters are provided in Table 1 0.1-1.  The 
half- life ( t1/2) of INCB001158 was approximately 6 hr and the C max ranged from approximately 
3–10 µM and occurred at approximately 4 hr after dosing.  The minimum target for continuous 
exposure of INCB001158 based on preclinical efficacy data was approximately 1.0 µM and the 
steady stat e C min (trough concentration) at 50, 100, and 150 mg BID was well above this target.

10.1.11  Pharmacodynamics of INCB001158  
The pharmacodynamic activity of INCB001158 was determined by direct measurement of 
arginine concentration and arginase activity in plasma.  Comparing to healthy volunteers, the 
cancer patients enrolled in this trial had reduced median plasma arginine conce ntration  and 
elevated level of arginase protein in predose samples on C1D1  (Figure 1 0.1-8, Panels A and C).  
Plasma arginine levels increased in all patients on study.  With the exception of two patients at 
50 mg BID, all patients on study had increases of more than 50% in plasma arginine level, and 
even the two patients had further elevations at later time points ( Figure 10.1 -8, Panel B).  These 
elevations in plasma arginine brought the plasma arginine of all patients into or above the normal 
range of plasma arginine concentration.  Further, direct measurement of plasma arginase activity 
demonstrated >90%  inhibitio n at 6h hours post-dose on C1D1, which was sustained predose on 
C1D15 ( Figure 10.1 -8, Panel D).

protein  levels in plasma were found to be elevated relative to healthy volunteers.  Panel D .  On C1D15, 
plasma argin ase activity was reduced to < 10 % in all 11 pts tested (n=5 at 50 mg and 6 at 100 mg) .  
Arginine concentration in plasma was measured by amino acid analysis.  Arginase protein was measured 
by ELISA and arginase activity was measured by incubating plasma with 13C-arginine and detecting 
formation of 13C ornithine by LC/MS -MS.

The preliminary safety profile of INCB001158 has been evaluated during dose escalation from 
50 to 150 mg BID.  INCB001158 has been well tolerated at all doses tested.  The rate of 
treatment -related adverse events  has been low (40% of pts), all of which  have been mild to 
moderate (Grade 1/2)  and only one of which (fatigue) has occurred in as many as 2 patients . No 
treatment -related serious adverse events (SAEs) or adverse events of Grade ≥ 3 have occu rred. 
Treatment -emergent Grade  ≥ 3 adverse events have occurred in 6 patients, all of which have 
been considered unrelated or unlikely related to study drug, and have generally been related to 
underlying disease .  Dose interruptions/reductions due to drug -related events have occurred in 
2 patients, both due to asymptomatic elevations in  urinary  OA (see below) in patients enrolled at 
the 150 mg dose level.

Urinary OA is being monitored as a sensitive biomarker of urea cycle inhibition in the liver .  
(Hepatic urea cycle inhibition leads to the accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which is 
metabolized via the pyrimidine synthesis pathway leading the synthesis and urinary excretion of 
OA).  Substantial elevations (generally to 100 -800X the upper limit of  normal) occur in patients 
with inherited defects in enzymes of the urea cycle.  A similar magnitude of urinary OA  
elevation (~1000X) was noted in animals that received doses of INCB001158 that were 
associated with toxicity in  preclinical safety studies, a lthough notable elevations in urinary OA 
were also noted in some animals treated at the NOAEL.   
Due to the limited availability of data describing the clinical sequelae associated with modest 
(5-100X ULN) elevations of urinary OA, a conservative threshold  of 5X the ULN was used to 
provide  evidence of urea cycle inhibition.  Importantly, elevations in OA are not considered a 
toxicity but, rather, function as a biomarker of urea cycle function.  In addition to urinary OA,

plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) as evidence  of clinically significant effects on the urea cycle.  
There has been no evidence of clinically significant urea cycle inhibition to date.  Although 
normal  variability of plasma ammonia and BUN has been seen, no dose related trends or 
significant outliers have been noted ( Tables 1 0.1-3 and 10.1-4).  In addition, no symptoms 
associated with clinically significant urea cycle inhibition (e.g., unexplained anorexia, nausea, 
vomiting, mental status changes, etc .) have been noted.

In one patient  at the 150 mg BID dose level , the fasting predose urinary OA on C1D15 was 
11.6 µmol/mmol  creatinine ( 7.7X ULN) and  the postdose (non -fasting) level was  47 µmol/mmol  
creatinine (31. 3x ULN).  This patient was asymptomatic without any significant changes in 
ammonia or BUN from baseline and the OA returned to baseline within 2 days of withholding 
the INCB001158  dose.  After dose reduction to 100 mg, the predose OA values were normal  
after 2 and 3 weeks of additional dosing.  However, despite the patient remaining asymptomatic, 
postdose elevations were noted  at these two time points  (27.4 and 131.6  µmol/mmol creatinine , 
respectively ), so the patient was dose reduced further to the 50 mg dose level , after which no 
further elevations were noted .  A second patient at the 150 mg dose level had elevated urinary 
OA predose on C2D8 ( 9.3 µmol/mmol creatinine; 6.2X ULN).  This patient  also remained 
asymptomatic and had no significant changes from baseline in plasma ammonia or BUN.  After a 
2-day interruption of study drug, the dose was reduced to 100 mg and no subsequent elevations 
in urinary  OA were noted.  
In summary, there has been no evidence of clinically significant inhibition of the urea cyc le to 
date.  Two patients have had asymptomatic elevations in urinary OA, a sensitive biomarker of

78 hepatic urea cycle inhibition, that were not associated with changes in plasma ammonia or BUN, 
but were dose reduced based on a protocol defined  urinary  OA threshold of 5X ULN.   Both 
patients  were able to  continue  on study drug  at the reduced dose without subsequent elevations 
in OA. 
10.2 Rationale  for Study Design  
10.2.1  Rationale for Starting Dose  
The starting dose  for monotherapy dose escalation  will be 50 mg BID.  This dose was selected 
based on the results of the GLP -compliant preclinical toxicology studies conducted in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys.  This dose is approximately one-thirty -sixth ( 1/36th) of the No Observable 
Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) and one -forty -eight (1/48th) of the highest non -severely toxic 
dose (HNSTD) in monkeys.  Monkeys were selected as the most appropriate species for starting 
dose selection based on 1) the greater genetic and, presumably, physiological similarity to 
humans and 2) the fact that they were more sensitive (as defined by plasma exposure  associated 
with toxicity ) to the toxic effects of INCB001158 .  A conservative starting dose was selected 
relative to the FDA S9 Guidance of one sixth (1/6th) the HNSTD in non -rodent speci es; the 
bioavailability in monkeys (20%) was lower than in other species tested and plasma exposures 
could  under -represent exposures that will be achieved in humans.  
This study will also evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of INCB001158  in com bination 
with the FDA -approved anti -PD-1 agent pembrolizumab .  The decision to open the anti -PD-1 
combination dose escalation is dependent on achieving either the target exposure that will lead to 
continuous inhibition of extracellular arginase 1 by >  90% (Cmin of ≥ 1μM) and/or an elevation of 
plasma arginine to levels that correlated with in vivo  activity in preclinical models (2.5 -fold 
elevation from baseline in plasma arginine).  The  starting dose of INCB001158  that will be used 
in combination with full dose pembrolizumab  will be 50 mg BID, which is 2 dose levels below 
the recommended monotherapy Phase 2 dose of 100 mg BID identified in Part 1a of this study . 
10.2.2  Rationale for Dose Escalation Strategy  
The dose escalation for this study will follow standard Modif ied Fibonacc i dose escalation 
schedule for both monotherapy and the pembrolizumab combination (see Table 5.1-1).  As 
described in Section  5.1, the selection of this dose escalation schedule was guided by the

CONFIDENTIAL  79 
VV-CLIN -000684  safety/tolerability of INCB001158  as well as the PK and pharmacodynamic data generated in the 
first two dose levels of the dose escalation .   
10.2.2.1  Rationale for Dose in Patients with Moderately I mpaired Renal Function  
A considerable pr oportion of patients with the tumor types being evaluated in this study have 
moderately impaired renal function (defined as CrCl 30-49 mL/min) due to multiple factors 
including underlying disease, prior treatments and procedures, or baseline chronic renal 
insufficiency.  Prior to Protocol Amendment 2 -US 2, such patients were excluded from this 
study, even though  they may well benefit from INCB001158 treatment.  However, s ince the 
primary mechanism of elimination of INCB001158 is thought to be renal clearance, patients with 
impaired renal function may need a lower dose of INCB001158 to achieve exposure similar to 
patients with normal renal function.  To test this  hypothesis , population PK modeling was used 
to determine and evaluate a reduced dos e of INCB001158 in patients with moderately impaired 
renal function  defined as Cr Cl 30-49 m L/min as calculated by the Cockcroft -Gault formula . 
The safety of INCB001158 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab has been well -
characterized in  the dose e scalation  Parts 1a and 1b (refer to the iIB).  The MTD was not reached 
across 4 dose levels in monotherapy (50, 75, 100, and 150 mg BID) and 3 dose levels in 
combination with pembrolizumab  (50, 75,  and 100 mg BID).  Pharmacokinetic data for 
INCB001158 in combination with pembrolizumab were similar to that of INCB001158 
monotherapy, which was expected, since pembrolizumab was not predicted to have an y effect on 
INCB001158 exposure .  Additionally, moderate renal impairm ent (GFR < 60 and 
≥  mL/min /1.73 m2) has no clinically important effect on the clearance of pembrolizumab  (refer 
to the pIB).  The minimum target for continuous e xposure of INCB001158 based on preclinical 
efficacy data is approximately 1.0 μM.  As mon otherapy, INCB001158 had steady -state C min 
(trough concentration) well above this target at all dose levels evaluated (50, 75, 100, and 
150 mg BID), indicating strong target inhibition.  Pharmacokinetic data from the 50 and 
75 mg BID dose levels in combination dose escalation also showed steady state Cmin > 1 µM 
with no differences in the overall exposure range between patients in monotherapy an d 
combination at steady state.  
The overall safety profile across 3 INCB001158 dose levels evaluated in combination with 
pembrolizumab was f avorable, with no DLTs or Grade 3 treatment -related AEs at the maximum

VV-CLIN -000684  dose level of INCB001158 100 mg BID.  INCB001158 PK and PD in combinat ion with 
pembrolizumab were  similar to that of INCB001158 monotherapy, with similar exposures at 
equivalent doses and strong target inhibition , as indicated by increases in plasma arginine.   The 
RP2D for INCB001158 alone and in combination with pembrolizum ab was declared as 100  mg 
BID.  Therefore, e valuation of  INCB001158 in patients with  moderate  renal impairment will be 
done in combination with pembrolizumab, s ince pembrolizumab did not have an y effect on 
INCB001158 exposure.  
In order to determine the appropriate  dose in patients with moderate renal impairment  (defined as 
CrCl 30 -49 m L/min) , population PK modeling  was performed,  incorporating  full PK data from 
patients enrolled to the already completed dose escalation parts in patients with CrCl 
> 50 mL/min.  The PK data  showed that INCB001158  AUC, C max, and half -life inversely 
correlated with  CrCl  across all tested doses, as expected  (Figure 10.2 -1).  Based on the strongly  
inverse linear relationship  between CrCl and AUC , extrapolation of the data to CrCl values 
below 50  mL/min indicated that a dose of 50  mg BID in patien ts wit h CrCl 30 to 49 m L/min 
predicted INCB001158 AUC values to fall within the known safe exposure range  corresponding 
to doses at or below the establis hed RP2D  of 100 mg BID (Table 10.2 -1).

10.2.3  Rationale for Patient Population s 
10.2.3.1  Monotherapy 
This is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety and tolerability of INCB001158 in cancer patients.  
Since it unknown whethe r INCB
001158 is efficacious, only patients with metastatic disease or 
advanced disease that is not amenable to local therapy will be enrolled.  Further, only patients for 
whom there are no available therapies that have been shown to provide clinical benefit (e.g., 
overall surviva l bene fit) will be enrolled.  In order to maximize the potential for identifying 
clinical bene
fit, the expansion cohorts will enroll tumor types that have been previously shown to 
have significant infiltration with MDSCs and/or Arg1+ cells.  Two monotherapy expansion 
cohorts identify specific patient populations, NSCLC (Part 2a
) and CRC (Part 2b), both of which 
have high 
infiltration with Arg1+ cells (see Section  10.1.2 ) and have a large unmet need.  An 
additional expansion cohort (Part 2c ) allows a broader group of patient to be enrolled consisting 
of tumor types that also have high infiltration of Arg1+ granulocytic MDS Cs and PMNs (by 
INCB001158  Protocol INCB 01158 -101

CONFIDENTIAL  82 
VV-CLIN -000684internal data or published accounts) , in order to identify a preliminary signal o f activity that can 
be subsequently followed up with a dedicated expansion cohort (or a separate clinical study).  
10.2.3.2  Combination  with A nti-PD-1 (Pembrolizumab ) 
As of the date when this amendment was authored, t he anti -PD-1 agent pembrolizumab  has been 
approve d for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, NSCLC , SCCHN , urothelial carcinoma, and 
solid tumors that are microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) or mismatch repair deficient 
(dMMR) .  Despite the impressive activity  observed for  this and other anti -PD-1/PD -L1 agents , a 
majority of patients with these disease s do not achieve an objective response to  these  agents and 
there is  a recognized  need for combination agents to either expand the population that benefits or 
amplifies the act ivity that they provide  (Melero 2015 ). 
Eight  patient populations are eligible to enroll into  expansion cohorts , including 
advanced/metastatic NSCLC ( Part 3a ), advanced/metastatic melanoma  (Part 3b ) 
advanced/metastatic UCC  (Part 3c), advanced/metastatic  MSI-H CRC ( Part 3d ), 
advanced/metastatic MSS CRC (Part 3e ), advanced/metastatic gastric /GEJ ( Part 3f ), 
advanced/metastatic SCCHN (Part 3g ), and advanced/metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma 
(Part 3h ).  Since a prima
ry objective of the expansion cohorts is to identify a signal of clinical 
activity of INCB001158 in combination with pembrolizumab, some of these cohorts will enroll 
patie nts that are unlikely to respond t o monotherapy pembrolizumab because they either 1) had 
disease progressi
on (even afte r an objective response) in the immediate prior line of therapy, OR 
2) had prolonged stable disease (≥ 24 w eeks) in the immediate prior line of therapy.  The 
attribution of evidence of clinical activity (e.g., objective responses) to INCB001158 in this 
population can be made more confidently given the low likelihood of a response to monotherapy 
anti-PD-1 therapy.  In addition to these “add-on” c ohorts, other cohorts will enroll patients that 
have never received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy.  There are generally two reasons to 
include these cohorts: 1) to identif
y activity in patient populations that are known to be 
unresponsive to PD-1 therapy (e.g., MSS CRC) and 2) to identify activity of the 
INCB001158/pembrolizumab combination that could be missed in pembrolizumab-refractory 
patients. 
All expansion cohorts target tumor types that have a significant proportion of patients with Arg+ 
infiltrating cells within tumor samples (as presented in Section 10.1) and/or elevated plasma 
arginase (alon
g with depleted plasma arginine) which may contribute to immune suppre ssion.

VV-CLIN -000684  11.0 PROCEDURES  
All patients must sign an IRB /IEC -approved informed consent prior to starting any protocol -
specific procedures, including screening procedures.  During the consent process, the person 
obtaining consent must inform the patient of all elements of informed consent.   Patients must 
also meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study . 
11.1 Screening Period  
11.1.1  Prior Treatment  
Reasonable efforts will be made during the screening period to determine all prior therapeutic 
treatment s received by the patient.   All previous cancer treatments, including systemic therapies, 
radiation,  and/or surgical procedures, should be recorded on the patients’ electronic case report 
forms (eCRFs).  
For some patients progressing on pembrolizumab in Parts 3a , 3b, 3c, and 3d, computerized 
tomography (CT) or magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) scans  and/ o r radiology reports  may be 
requested for  tumor evaluations  during the course of prior pembrolizumab  or other anti -PD-1 
therapy in order to document the status of stable disease and/or progressive disease.   
11.1.2  Concomitant Treatment  
Medications or vaccinations  specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination ma y be 
required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor Clinical 
Director.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator 
and/or the patient 's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the patient  on trial 
therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor,  
and the patient .

VV-CLIN -000684  11.1.2.1  Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant treatment with other therapies is permitted if the med ication is not expected to 
interfere with the evaluation of safety or efficacy of the study treatment s.  During the study, if 
the use of any concomitant treatment becomes necessary ( e.g., for treatment of an adverse event), 
the treatment must be recorded o n the appropriate e CRF, including t he reason for treatment,  
name of the drug, dosage, route, and start and stop dates of administration.   
For patients receiving INCB001158  in combination with pembrolizumab  (Parts 1b and 3) : In 
patients that are currently receiving pembrolizumab (Parts 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d) as part of their 
prior line of therapy, pembrolizumab should be administered continuously, if possible (i.e., there 
is no need to discontinue or pause pembrolizumab dosing).    
11.1.2.2  Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Patient s are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and 
Treatment Phase (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational therapeutic agents other than the study treatment s, INCB001158 and 
pembrolizumab  
• Radiation therapy  
− Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
considered on an exceptional case by case basis after consultation with Sponsor.  
The patient  must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field.   
• Live va ccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid (oral) vaccine.  Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed 
virus vaccines and are allowed.   However, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist®) 
are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

VV-CLIN -000684  • Systemic glucocorticoids for any purp ose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic 
doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.  
− Note:  Inhaled steroids are allowed for manageme nt of asthma.  
• Except for erythropoietin or darbepoetin alpha (Aranesp®), use of growth factors (i.e., 
G-CSF, GM -CSF, etc.) is not permitted in the first treatment cycle unless the patient 
experiences a hematologic DLT.  
• Concomitant treatment with valproic acid/valproate -containing therapies is not permitted 
as hyperammonemia is a well -described toxicity of valproic acid, particularly at high 
exposures, potentially through inhibition of the urea cycle ( Verrotti 2002 ; 
Wadzinski  2007 ). 
• Concomitant treatment with allopurinol or other xanthine oxidase inhibitors is not 
allowed during the monotherapy dose escalation of INCB001158 ( Part 1a ).  Xanthine 
oxidase inhibitors cause an accu mulation of OA in the urine, which would confound the 
assessment of safety in these patients.   
11.1.3  Screening Evaluation  
The following screening assessments must be performed within 21  days  before study treatment  
administration on C1 D1 according to the Attachment 1  [with the exception of imaging 
(CT/MRI); scans performed within 28 days of study treatment  administration on C1D1 are 
acceptable].  P rocedures listed below that are performed as part o f the normal standard of care 
and within 21  days prior to  C1D1 may be used for screening purposes:  
• Sign and date an IRB/IEC -approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) before any study -
specific (i.e., non -standard of care) screening procedures are performed  
• Demographic information including date of birth, sex, and ethnic origin  
• Medical history including review of prior cancer treatments

VV-CLIN -000684  If the serum pregnancy test is negative after a urine test was positive, then the investigator will 
assess the potential benefit/risk to the subject and determine whether it is in the subject's best 
interest to resume study treatment and continue participation in the study.  
11.4 End of Treatment (EOT)  
The End of Treatment (EOT) visit must occur within 28 days of treatment discontinuation and 
prior to initiation of any new anti -cancer therapy /regimen.  All patients discontinuing  study 
treatment for any reason should  undergo the following EOT procedures:  
• AE monitoring

• Complete physical examination  
• ECOG performance status evaluation  
• Clinical laboratory values (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry and urinalysis)  
• Urine pregnancy test for women of child -bearing potential  
• Duplicate 12 -lead ECG with QTcF  
• Radiographic evaluation (e.g., diagnostic CT or MRI) of tumor burden .  Patients who  
discontinue from study due to objective findings of progressive disease during an 
on-treatment evaluation do not need to have repeat scans.  CT or MRI is required for all 
patients who have not had at least 1 post -baseline image.  
11.5 Follow -Up 
11.5.1  Safety Follow -Up 
The safety follow -up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow -up 
visits, which should occur 30 to 37 days (all patients ) and 90 to 97 days (Parts 1b and 3 only) 
after the final dose of study treatments.  
Adverse events (all pa tients) and SAEs (Parts 1a and 2 only) must be reported up until the date of 
the 30-day follow -up visit, or until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed 
irreversible, whichever is longer.  
Serious a dverse events (Parts 1b and 3 only) must be  reported up until the date of the  90-day 
follow -up visit, or until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, 
whichever is longer.

10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  91 
VV-CLIN -000684  Reasonable efforts should be made to have the patient  return for the follow -up visits and report 
any AEs that may occur during this period .  If the patient  cannot return to the site for the safety 
follow -up visit (eg, lives far away), the patient  should be contacted by telephone for assessment 
of AEs and SAEs .  Sites should document this contact in the  source.  
If a patient  is scheduled to begin a new anticancer th erapy before the end of the 90 -day safety 
follow -up period, the safety follow -up visit should be performed before new anticancer therapy 
is started .  Once new anticancer therapy has been initia ted, the patient  will have completed the 
follow -up period.  
11.5.2  Disease Status Follow -Up 
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression will continue 
to be assessed for their disease status during the follow -up phase and should continue to have 
tumor assessments every 8 weeks (monotherapy) or 9 weeks (pembrolizumab combination) until 
a new cancer therapy is started, disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of 
the study . 
11.6 Screen Failures  
Patients who sig n an informed consent form, are not assigned to a treatment, and do not receive 
either INCB001158  or pembrolizumab are defined as screen failures.   For all screen failures, the 
Investigator will enter the screening number, patient initials, and reason(s) f or screen failure into 
the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  These data will also be retained in the Investigator’s 
study files and can be printed by the site in log format at the end of the study.  
11.7 Safety Evaluation  
Routine safety and tolerability wi ll be evaluated from the results of reported signs and 
symptoms, scheduled physical examinations, vital sign measurements, duplicate 12-lead ECGs 
(including QTc F intervals), and clinical laboratory test results.  
More frequent safety evaluations may be perf ormed if clinically indicated or at the discretion of 
the Investigator .  All AEs will be recorded from the time the patient receives the f irst dose of 
study treatment  up to 28  days after the last dose . 
11.7.1  Physical Examination  
Complete p hysical examinations wi ll be performed by a licensed physician (or physician’s 
assistant or nurse practitioner) at Screening  and End of Treatment.  Symptom -directed physical

(Attachment 1 ). 
11.7.2  Vital Signs  
Vital signs (blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and temperature) will be obtained in the 
sitting position.  All patients should be sitting for 3 -5 min prior to obtaining vital signs .  
Orthostatic vital signs will be measured on Cycle 1 days 1 and 15 at predose and 4 hrs post dose  
during the dose escalation  (Part 1a) .  Due to the absence of an effect on orthostatic vital signs, 
orthostatic vital signs will only be required for patients enrol led in Part 1a.  If effects on blood 
pressure are eventually noted, additional orthostatic vital sign monitoring will be re -introduced in 
Parts 1b, 2 and 3.  
In Parts 1b and 3, on the day of pembrolizumab infusion, vital signs will be obtained 
pre-infusion,  15 minutes after the start of the infusion , at the end of the infusion, and 15  minutes 
after completion of the infusion .  Vital signs should be collected ± 5 minutes from the scheduled 
times note d above.  
11.7.3  Electrocardiograms  
Patients should rest in the supi ne position for at least 5 min before each 12 -lead ECG recording 
is started .  Duplicate  ECG recordings must be performed using a standard, high -quality, high -
fidelity electrocardiograph machine equipped with computer -based interval measurements .  The 
avera ge of values will used for Inclusion/Exclusion and AE reporting purposes.  
For safety monitoring purposes, the ECG must  be reviewed , signed, and dated  promptly by a 
qualified physician (or qualified physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner) and any clini cally 
important finding recorded on the appropriate eCRF.   The Investigator is responsible for 
providing the interpretation of all ECGs.   The results will include heart rate  (HR), R -R interval 
(RR) , PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc F interval.   The corrected QT interval will 
be corrected for respiratory rate according to the following formula:  
Fridericia’s formula:  QTcF = QT/RR0.33

VV-CLIN -00068412.0 POTENTIAL TOXICITIES, DOSE MODIFICATION  AND MANAGEMENT OF 
TOXICITIES  
12.1 Potential Toxicities  
12.1.1  INCB001158  
INCB001158 is a pote nt and selective inhibitor of arginase 1 and arginase 2.  Arginase 1 is 
primarily ex
pressed in granulocytic myeloid cell granules, where it is excreted extracellularly 
and depletes extracellular arginine levels, and in liver hepatocytes, where it functions 
intracellularly as part of the urea cycle.  It has been shown tha t INCB001158 is ~1000- fold more 
potent at inhibition of extracellula r arginase 1 than intracellular arginase 1 that is engaged in the 
urea cycle, primarily due to poor penetration of INCB001158 across cell membranes and the 
“enzy matic channeling” phenomenon (Cheung 1989) that restricts a ccess of exogenous arginine 
or INCB001158 to urea cycle enzymes.  Arginase 2 is primarily expressed in the mitochondria of 
many other tissues, including the gut and in kidney.  The functions of Arginase 2 in these tissues 
include regulation of systemic arginine concentration, regulation of the production of 
downstream products (e.g., proline, polyamines) and regulation of arginine availability for nitric 
oxide sy nthesis.  Inhibition of arginase 2 is thought to result in elevations in systemic arginine 
levels, which may contri
bute to the therapeutic effect.  Elevated arginine (up to ~100-fold above 
baseline) has been well tolerated in humans following intravenous administration.  Ten-fold 
elevations in plasma arginine (to a mea n concentration of 822 μM) wa s associated with no 
chan
ge in systolic or diastolic blood pressure and a 100-fold increase in arginine was a ssociated 
with  mild reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (~9 mmHg for each) ( Mehta 1996 , 
Bode-Böger 1998 ). 
The results of the GLP-compliant rat and monkey toxicity studies are presente d in 
Section  10.1.8 .  The low- and mid-dose levels were well tolerated with no adverse findings and 
the mid-dose being considered the NOAEL in both species.  INCB001158 exposures at the 
mid- dose level were >16-fold above the projected human efficacious exposure and were 
associated with robust pharmacodynamic ef fects (e.g ., elevated plasma arginine) with no 
significant toxicities noted. 
Potential Urea Cycle Toxicity  
As detailed in Section 10.1.8, high doses of INCB001158 that resulted in significant morbidity 
and mortality in mice, rats, and monkey s achieved exposures over 19-fold above the projected 
INCB001158  Protocol INCB 01158 -101 
10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  99 
VV-CLIN -000684  human efficacious exposure.  In the nonclinical animal studies, the toxicity at the high doses was 
associated with evidence or hepatic urea cycle inhibition including an elevation in liver arginine 
concentration, an increase in plasma ammonia concentration, a decrease in BUN concentration, 
and an increase in urinary OA levels.  Of particular interest, urinary OA was elevated by  
> 1,000 -fold in rats at the high dose following a single dose, prior to any signs of toxicity.  
Smaller elevations in urinary OA were also measured in some animals at the well -tolerated 
mid-dose level.   
Several measures of potential toxicity related to u rea cycle inhibition will be evaluated in this 
study (see Attachments 1  and 2).  In particular, urinary OA, plasma (venous) ammonia and BUN 
will be measured on Day 1 and at regular intervals i n the dose escalation portion of the study 
(Part 1a).  
Orotic acid    When the urea cycle is disrupted, the urea cycle substrate carbamoyl phosphate 
accumulates and is diverted into the pyrimidine synthesis pathway, producing substantial 
quantities of the p yrimidine precursor OA.  The elevated  OA is rapidly cleared in the urine and is 
used as a sensitive assay to identify defects in the urea cycle either due to inborn errors or 
inhibition.  
Ammonia  Urea cycle inhibition can result in large elevations in ammon ia, which can lead to 
CNS toxicity.  Inhibition of arginase, the last step in the urea cycle, does not tend to cause 
dramatic elevations in ammonia, but they are possible and will be evaluated as ammonia is the 
primary mechanism of acute toxicity associate d with urea cycle inhibition.  Since plasma 
ammonia can be quite variable, elevations in plasma ammonia should be confirmed, particularly 
in asymptomatic patients.  
BUN  Blood urea nitrogen is a measure of plasma urea and can be reduced in the setting of urea 
cycle inhibition.  Since it is also effected by other factors ( e.g., protein consumption, fluid 
status/dehydration) it is not an ideal biomarker of urea cycle function.  However, clear evidence 
of significant reduction in plasma BUN would be consisten t with sustained inhibition of the 
hepatic urea cycle and should be avoided.  
Immune -related AEs (irAEs)  
It is not known to what extent arginine depletion is operative in normal tissues or in non -cancer 
inflammatory states.  However, s ince arginase -mediated  depletion of arginine is a n 
immunosuppressive mechanism, irAEs  may be associated with the restoration of local arginine 
INCB001158  Protocol INCB 01158 -101 
10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  100 
VV-CLIN -000684  by INCB001158  treatment .  Although preclinical toxicity studies have not demonstrated any 
evidence of increased inflammation or autoimm unity, these models tend to be poor predictors of 
the safety profile of immune -oncology agents in humans.  Experience with other 
immun o-oncology agents that target endogenous immunosuppressive mechanisms has 
demonstrated that irAEs  can affect any organ or tissue, but most frequently occur in the skin 
(rash), gastrointestinal system (diarrhea/colitis), liver (hepatitis), lungs (pneumonitis), endocrine 
system (endocrinopathies due to inflammation of the pituitary, thyroid and adrenals), and 
kidneys (nephritis ).   
Documentation of the immune -mediated nature of toxicities (e.g., through demonstration of 
immune infiltration in biopsy tissue) will be of great value and an effort should be made in cases 
of severe or prolonged potential irAEs  to provide evidence of the role of the immune system.  
Management of irAEs  will follow the general approach that has been used for other 
immun o-oncology agents, including 1) withholding study treatment  for events of moderate or 
worse severity (Grade ≥ 2) and  2) the use of immuno suppressive corticosteroids for more severe  
irAEs  (Grade  ≥ 3) or prolonged irAEs (lasting > two weeks with minimal or no improvement 
despite withholding study treatment ).  High dose steroids may be used for particularly severe 
irAEs or irAEs that fail to r espond to initial oral steroids within 3 -4 days.   Non-steroid 
immunosuppressive agents may also be employed for steroid -refractory irAEs . 
Alterations in hemodynamic status  
Although preclinical toxicity studies have not identified this as a toxicity signal,  reductions in 
blood pressure leading to orthostatic  hypotension, presyncope, or syncope  are possible due to 
increased production of nitric oxide (NO) in response  to the increased availability of circulating 
arginine, a key substrate for the NO -producing N itric Oxide Synthase (NOS) enzymes.  This is 
considered an unlikely  toxicity for INCB001158  based on the absence of preclinical evidence of 
hypotension and the tolerability of very high levels of arginine when administered intravenously 
to humans, includin g the absence of an effect on blood pressure in individuals with a 10 -fold 
mean increase of plasma arginine  (Mehta 1996 , Bode -Böger 1998 ) There has been no preclinical 
evidence of altered hemodynamic st atus in any preclinical studies of INCB001158 .  In order to 
identify modest changes in hemodynamic status, frequent monitoring of blood pressure and 
careful assessment of orthostatic hypotension will be monitored in addition to standard vital 
signs as part  of this study .

VV-CLIN -000684  12.1.2  Pembrolizumab ( Patients E nrolled in Parts 1b , 1c, and 3 ) 
Pembrolizumab  is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 ( PD-1) receptor, thus inhibiting 
its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death ligand 2 
(PD-L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor 
blocking activity for PD -1.  Pembr olizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in 
clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.  
Keytruda™ (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of 
indications.  For more details on specific indications refer to the Investigator brochure.  
The safety profile of pembrolizumab is fully described in the pembrolizumab  
Label /Investigator’s Brochure  and primarily consists of immune -related adverse events (ir -AEs) 
due to activ ation and proliferation of T -cells.  Ir -AEs can affect any organ or tissue, but most 
frequently occur in the skin (rash), gastrointestinal system (diarrhea/colitis), liver (hepatitis), 
lungs (pneumonitis), endocrine system (endocrinopathies due to inflamma tion of the pituitary, 
thyroid and adrenals), and kidneys (nephritis).  The management of these toxicities is described 
in the pembrolizumab Label /Investigator’s Brochure  but generally includes  holding drug for 
moderate (Grade 2) toxicities and using syste mic immunosuppression for severe (Grade 3/4) or 
prolonged moderate (> 1 week) toxicities.  Additional immunosuppression (e.g., anti -TNFα 
therapy, infliximab) may be used if IV steroids are ineffective.  
12.1.2.1  INCB001158  + Pembrolizumab Combination  
The safety and tolerability of INCB001158  + pembrolizumab  is not known.  A primary objective 
of the current study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of 
pembrolizumab and INCB001158 .  Preclinical studies of the combination of an anti -PD-1 agent 
and INCB001158  have been performed in mice for the purpose of evaluating the anti -tumor 
activity of the combination.  In these experiments, the combination of anti -PD-1 and 
INCB001158  appeared to be well tolerated, but an extensive safety evaluation was no t 
performed.  
12.1.3  Dose Modifications and Toxicity Management  
The expected toxicity risks for INCB001158  based on preclinical toxicity study data  are 
summarized above .  In general, management of AEs related to INCB001158  includes

10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  102 
VV-CLIN -000684  withholding the medication for moderate to severe toxicities and providing the appropriate 
supportive care.  
The safety and tolerability profile of pembrolizumab  is well defined and outlined in the 
pembrolizumab  Label /Investigator’s Brochure .  Ir-AEs are defined as those that occur while  
receiving pembrolizumab , require immunosuppression and have no clear alternate etiology.  
Guidelines for the management of ir -AEs and study treatment  dosing are provided below.  In 
general, for moderate to severe ir -AEs, pembrolizumab  should be withheld o r permanently 
discontinued and, depending on the nature of the AE, it should be managed with high -dose 
corticosteroids and hormone -replacement therapy, if necessary.  Upon improvement to Grade 1 
or less, a corticosteroid taper should be initiated and conti nued over at least 1 month.  Restarting 
pembrolizumab may be considered after completion of corticosteroid taper based on the severity 
of the event.  In some cases, the natural history of AEs associated with immunotherapy can differ 
from and be more severe  than AEs caused by agents belonging to other therapeutic classes.  
Early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity.  Evaluation and management 
guidelines for the following types of ir -AEs are provided in the pembrolizumab 
Label /Investigator’ s Brochure : pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis/renal 
dysfunction, rash and encephalitis.  
For patients in the Dose Escalation Phase, dose reductions of INCB001158  will be permitted 
during Cycle 1 (first 28 days) only if a patient e xperiences DLT or a toxicity that may herald a 
DLT.  If a patient experiences a DLT, treatment continuation at a lower dose of INCB001158  
will be permitted as long as the toxicity has returned to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 28 days and 
pembrolizumab thera py can be continued.  Upon recovery, patients may restart at one 
INCB001158  dose level lower.  Patients who do not recover within 28 days will not be eligible 
for resumption of study treatment  without approval from the Medical Monitor .  After Cycle 1, 
dose reductions or interruptions for adverse events may take place at any time at the discretion of 
the Principal Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
12.1.3.1  Dose Modification Guidelines  
Patients will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study .  Treatment modifications (e.g., 
dose delay) will be based on specific laboratory and AE criteria.   
INCB001158 : Guidelines for  AE management and  dose modifications of INCB001158 due to 
AEs are provided in Table 1 2.1-1.  Thes e guidelines are based on the clinical experience with 
INCB001158  Protocol INCB 01158 -101 
10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  103 
VV-CLIN -000684  INCB001158  to date.  These guidelines are intended primarily for toxicities that are not easily 
managed with routine supportive care.  For example, alopecia does not require dose 
modification, nor does  Grade 2 nausea/vomiting that is easily managed with anti -emetics.   
INCB001 158/pembrolizumab combination : Adverse events associated with pembrolizumab 
exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These immune -related AEs (irAEs) may 
occur shortly afte r the first dose or several months after the last dose of pembrolizumab 
treatment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously.   Therefore, early 
recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications.  Based on existing 
clinical study data, most irAEs are reversible and can be managed with interruptions of 
pembrolizumab and administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care.  For suspected 
irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other cau ses.  Additional 
procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, and skin biopsy may be included as part of 
the evaluation.  Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue 
pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids.  Dose modifi cation and toxicity management 
guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided in Table 12.1 -2.  Management  
of irAES occurring on combination therapy should follow dose interruption/modification 
guidelines for INCB001158 and pembrolizumab outlined in Tables 12.1 -1 and 12.1-2, 
respectively.  
These paramet ers are only guidelines and are not intended to supersede the clinical judgment of 
the treating physician.   Investigators should err on the side of caution in the setting of potential 
ir-AEs.  Investigators should contact the  Medical Monitor  if 1) a d ose m odification is planned, 
2) systemic immunosuppression is required (NB: if immediate systemic immunosuppression is 
required, please DO NOT delay the start of immunosuppressive therapy in order to speak with 
the Medical Monitor), or 3) there is a preference to deviate from the guidelines for the 
management of AEs or dose modifications.   Holding of the study treatment  and study 
discontinuation for both non -hematological and hematological toxicities will be based on the 
Principal Investigator’s judgment followi ng discussion with the Medical Monitor.  
12.1.3.2  Resumption of Study Treatment  
For both INCB001158  and pembrolizumab , treatment may be delayed for up to 4 weeks from the 
last dose.  Delays longer than 4 weeks are allowed only in cases where a prolonged steroid tape r 
is required to manage drug -related AEs or, in some cases, if the delay was due to a

VV-CLIN -000684  non-drug-related cause.  Prior to re -initiating treatment in a patient with a dosing interruption 
lasting >  4 weeks, the Medical Monitor must be consulted.  Treatment com pliance will be 
monitored by drug accountability as well as the patient ’s medical record and eCRF.  
Upon withholding study treatment s for adverse events, the study treatment s may be restarted 
when the AE has returned to ≤ Grade 1.  For patients that require  a steroid taper, pembrolizumab 
should not be restarted until the steroid taper is complete.  In cases in which a particular toxicity 
is clearly related to only one of the two study treatment s, the study treatment  that is not involved 
in causing the AE may be restarted prior to a return to  Grade 1.  If INCB001158  is restarted 
after permanent discontinuation of pembrolizumab , INCB001158  should be permanently 
discontinued for a > Grade 3 recurrence of the AE that r esulted in pembrolizumab 
discontinuation.

VV-CLIN -000684  12.1.3.3  Supportive Care Guidelines  
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the  treating 
Investigator .  Guidelines outlined below should be used in conjunction with information 
provided in the pembrolizumab  product label : 
Hyperammonemia:   Patients should be monitored for elevated venous plasma ammonia.  
Asymptomatic clinically significant drug -related elevations in ammonia (e.g., a repeatable 
elevation in ammonia  > 2x ULN AND >  2x baseline) should managed by interrupting 
INCB001158 study drug and monitoring to resolution.  For s ymptomatic elevations ( i.e., 
significant ammonia elevation associated with nausea, vomiting, severe anorexia, mental status 
changes, seizure, or other symptoms associated with hyperammo nemia), patients should be 
admitted for management according to the local institutional protocol for hyperammonemia, 
including 1)  sending appropriate labs [ammonia (on ice, measured STAT) , plasma amino acid 
profile,  LFTs, electrolytes, bicarb, BUN, creatin ine, glucose , and  urine orotic acid ], 2) IV 
hydration wit h dextrose -containing fluids, 3)  disco ntinuation of protein intake, 4)  implementing 
therapy to reduce ammonia levels (oral lactul ose/lacitol, IV Ammonul), and 5)  identifying and 
treating any potentia l triggers (e.g., discontinue corticosteroids, treat infections, etc).  
Diarrhea:  Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis  (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and  of bowel 
perforatio n (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   In symptomatic patients,  infectious etiologies 
should be ruled out, and if symptoms are persistent and/or sever e, endoscopic evaluation should 
be considered.   In patients with severe enterocolitis, treatment with systemic corticosteroids 
should be initiated at a dose of 1 to  2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent .  In patients that do 
not respond to high dose steroids with 72 hr, consider initiation of additional immunosuppressive 
therapy (e.g., infliximab).  When  symptoms improve to Grade 1 or  less, corticosteroid taper 
should be started and continued over at least 1  month.  
In addition, patients with severe enterocolitis that are receiving INCB001158  monotherapy will 
have INCB001158  permanently discontinued, where as, for patients receiving 
INCB001158 /pembrolizumab combination, pembrolizumab will be permanently discontinued  
and INCB001158  will be withheld.  Restarting INCB001158  may be considered in 
INCB001158 /pembrolizumab combination patients if enterocolitis is n ot a toxicity associated 
with monotherapy INCB001158 .

10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  112 
VV-CLIN -000684  In patients with moderate enterocolitis, pembrolizumab should be withheld and antidiarrheal  
treatment should be started.  If symptoms are persistent for more than  one week, systemic 
corticosteroids s hould be initiated (e.g., 0.5 mg/kg/day of  prednisone or equivalent).  When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less,  corticosteroid taper should be started and continued over 
at least 1 month.   Regarding guidelines for continuing treatment with INCB001158  and 
pembrolizumab , see Table 1 2.1-2. 
All patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal quantities of  clear fluids. 
If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should  be substituted  via IV 
infusion.  
Nausea/vomiting:  Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and  consideration 
should be given in subsequent cycles to the administration of  prophylactic antiemetic therapy 
according to standard institutional practice.  Patients  should be strongly encouraged to maintain 
liberal oral fluid intake.   Since nausea/vomiting can be a symptom of hyperammonemia, there 
should be a low threshold to test plasma ammonia levels for patients with nausea, vomiting, or 
new onset anorexia.  
Anemia:  Transfusions and/or erythropoietin may be utilized as clinically indicated  for the 
treatment of anemia, but should be clearly n oted as concurrent medications.  
Neutropenia:  Prophylactic use of colony -stimulating factors including Granulocyte  Colony -
Stimulat ing Factor (G -CSF), pegylated G -CSF or Granulocyte Macrophage  Colony -Stimulating 
Factor (GM-CSF) is not allowed in this study.  Therapeutic use of  G-CSF is allowed in patients 
with Grade 3 -4 febrile neutropenia.  
Thrombocytopenia : Transfusion of platelets m ay be used if clinically indicated.  Idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP) should be ruled out before initiation of platelet transfusion.  
Anti -infectives:  Patients with a documented infectious complication should receive  oral or IV 
antibiotics or other  anti-infective agents as considered appropriate by the  treating Investigator for 
a given infectious condition, according to standard  institutional practice.

CONFIDENTIAL  113 
VV-CLIN -000684  Immune -related adverse events:  Patients who develop a G rade 2 or higher irAE (e.g.,  colitis, 
skin rash, hepatitis, uveitis, hypo - or hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, or any other), should be 
discussed immediately with the Medical Monitor .  Depending on the type and severity of an 
irAE, oral or IV treatment with a corticosteroid should be considered, in a ddition to appropriate 
symptomatic treatment of a given condition.  For severe immune -mediated adverse events that 
do not respond to high dose IV steroids within 72 hours, consider initiation of additional 
immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., infliximab for no n-hepatic toxicities or mycophenolate 
mofentil for immune -mediated hepatotoxicity).  
Dose modification and toxicity management of infusion reactions related to 
pembrolizumab:   Pembrolizumab may cause severe or life -threatening infusion reactions, 
including severe hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis.  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or 
shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of 
infusion.  Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for pembroli zumab -associated

VV-CLIN -000684  12.2 Dose Adjustments, Infusion Delays,  and Missed Doses 
Missed doses of INCB001158  should be skipped.  If a patient forgets to take a dose of 
INCB001158 study drug and he/she is outside of the allotted window period (± 6 hr), he/she 
should be instructed  to skip that dose and NOT to take extra INCB001158 study drug at their 
next administration.  
In the case that an infusion cannot be administered at a scheduled visit, it has to be administered 
as soon as possible.  If the delay is between 1 and 7 days, the procedures at the original 
scheduled vis it should be performed, and subsequent visits will follow every 2 weeks (the 
infusion at the original schedule visit will be considered a missed dose).  Patients with infusion 
delays >  35 days should discontinue from the study unless approved by the Medica l Monitor in 
settings where benefit/ risk may justify continued study therapy.  
12.3  Discontinuation of Treatment and Withdrawal of Patients  
The reasons a patient may discontinue or be withdrawn from the study include, but are not 
limited to, adverse event s, disease progression , patient request, Investigator decision, protocol 
violation, patient noncompliance, and study termination by the Sponsor.  
When a patient discontinues or is withdrawn, the Investigator or designee will notify the Sponsor 
(or designee) and should perform all End of Treatment and follow up procedures as indicated in 
the Schedule of Study Assessments  (Attachment 1 ) after discontinuation of study treatment .  The 
Investigator or designee must document in the sourc e if the patient withdrew consent from 
treatment/ study procedure only or from treatment/ study procedures and from further contact.

Study treatment is defined as any investi gational treatme nt(s) or marke ted product(s) intended to 
be administered to a study subjec t according to the study Protoc ol.  There are 2 investigational 
study treatments in this study –  INCB001158 a nd pembroliz umab.  INCB001158 is also re ferred 
to as the study drug in this Protoc ol.  Although pembrolizumab is approved and marketed in 
various indications, it is investigational in this study in combination wit h INCB001158. 
13.1 S tudy Treatment Administration 
INCB001158 
S
tudy drug (INCB001158) needs to be taken orally as capsule or ta blet ( 25 mg or 100 mg per 
capsule 
or tablet) formulation.  INCB001158 will be administered only to patients who have 
signed and dated a n I
nformed Conse nt Form.  Pa tients in Part 1a and 2: INCB001158 needs to be 
taken on Days 1 throug h 28 of each 28-day cyc le and should be taken ora lly using the number of 
capsules or tablets directed in the Pharmacy Manual.   
 
  Patients in Part 1b and 3: INCB001158 needs to be taken on 
Da
ys 1 through 21 of eac h 21-day cycle and should be taken orally using the number of capsules 
or tablets directed in the Pharmacy Manual.  INCB001158 dosing will not be adjusted for body 
weight or surface area.  Patients will continue to rece ive INCB001158 until disease progression 
(per irRECIST), intolerable toxicity, patient withdra ws consent, or the Investigator determines 
that i t is not in the patient’s best interest to re main on study. 
The 
study drug should be taken by the patie nt at approximately the same times each day on an 
empty stom ach with a full glass of water.  The first dose shoul d be taken at lea st 2 hr before 
breakfa st.  T
he evening dose of INCB001158 will be taken approximately 12 hr later and at least 
2 hr before or 1 hr after eating a meal.  The eff ect of food is being evaluated in Part 1a during 
monotherapy dose escalation.  If it is demonstrated that improved bioavailability can be achieved 
by takin g INCB001158 with food, then patients thenceforth will take the drug with breakfast and 
dinner. 
On PK day s (see Attach ment 1) patients should be instruc ted NOT to take their morning dose of 
INCB001158 at home.  The morning dose must be administered at the clinical site after all 
pre-dose procedures have been perfor med.  The time of dosing will be recorded in the clinic.

VV-CLIN -000684  The evening doses will be self -administered by the patient after all post -dose activities have been 
complete.  
Patients enrolled in the pembrolizumab combination cohorts (Part1b and Part 3) will have all 
pre-dose procedures performed prior to receiv ing pembrolizumab .  Once the pembrolizumab  
infusion is complete, patients should be instructed to take their morning dose of INCB001158 .  
Breakfast should not be eaten until at least 2 hr after taking INCB001158 .  The time of dosing  
will be recorded  in the clinic .  The evening dose of INCB001158 will be taken by the patient as 
usual .  On non -PK collection days, patients will take INCB001158  per their usual administration 
schedule.  
Patients who vomit their INCB001158  dose should be instructed NOT to make up that dose and 
to report the frequency of vo miting occurrences associated with study drug administration to the 
site.  Patients who report ≥ 3 incidences of vomiting associated with study drug administration 
will have a blood sample drawn for an unscheduled PK analysis.  
Pembrolizumab   
Pembrolizumab will be administered  on day 1  of each 3 -week treatment cycle after all 
procedures and assessments have been completed as detailed on the schedule of assessment.  
Pembrolizumab  will be administered as a dose of 200 mg using a 30 -minute IV infusion.  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window between -5 minutes 
and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes -5 min/+10 min).   Patients will 
continue to receive pembrolizumab until disease progression (per irRECIST), intolerable 
toxicity, patient withdraws consent,  or the Investigator determines that is not in the patient’s best 
interest to remain on study.  The maximum duration of pembrolizumab treatment on study will 
be up to 35 doses (approximately 2 years).  
Pembrolizumab  (Keytruda®) is supplied either as a 50 m g, lyophilized powder in single -use vial s 
for reconstitution  or as a 25 mg/mL sterile solution for infusion in 4 mL vials .  The dose recently 
approved in the United States and several other countries for treatment of melanoma patients  is 
2 mg/kg Q3W .  Please refer to the pembrolizumab Label /Investigator’s Brochure  for specific

VV-CLIN -000684  The Investigator  or designee must maintain an accurate record of dispensing the study drug in a 
Drug Accountability Log , a copy of which must be given to the Sponsor at the end of the study .  
The Drug Accountability Log will record the study drugs received, dosages prepared, time 
prepared, doses dispensed, and doses destroyed.  The Drug Accountability Log will be reviewed 
by the field monitor during site visits and at the completion of the study.  
If evidence of tampering is observed, notify the Sponsor and return the questionable 
INCB001158  shipment with the appropriate for m to the contract distribution center.  Returned 
and unused INCB001158  study drug  may also be destroyed and documented at the investigative 
site in accordance with approved site/institution standard operating procedures.  
13.5 Study Treatment  Compliance  
Compliance with all study -related treatments should be emph asized to the patient by the site 
personnel, and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance during the study.  
Compliance with INCB001158 will be calculated by the sponsor based on the drug 
accountability documented by the site staff and will  be monitored by the sponsor/designee 
(capsule /tablet  counts).  Patients will be instructed to bring all unused INCB001158 
capsules /tablets  with them to the study visits from Cycle 2 Day 1 onwards, in order for site 
personnel to conduct capsule /tablet  coun ts to assess study treatment accountability.  The drug 
accountability documentation will be used by the sponsor to calculate treatment compliance.  
Missed doses of INCB001158  should be skipped.  If a patient forgets to take a dose of study drug 
and he/she i s outside of the allotted window period (± 6 hr), he/she should be instructed NOT to 
take extra study drug at their next administration.

15.0 S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
15.1 G eneral Statistical Considerations 
Protoc ol INCB 01158 -101 is a Phase 1 mul ticenter, open-label study in patients with advanced 
and metastatic solid tumors. 
Since this is an open-label clinical trial, descriptive statis tics will be employed to analyze the 
data by tumor type and dose level.  Summary statis tics for continuous variables will include the 
mean, standard deviation, median, and range (minimum/maximum ).  Categorical variables will 
be presente d by tumor type as frequency counts and percent ages, and time- to-event variables will 
be summarized by Kaplan-Meier plots, medians, and range s. 
The data will be tabulated and analyzed with respect to patient enroll ment and disposition, 
demographic and baseline characteristic s, prior and concomitant medications, efficacy, and 
safety measures.  The efficacy analysis will be conducted on the Efficacy Evaluable Population, 
and the safety analysis will be performed on the Safety Population (se e Section  15.3.1). 
All conf
idence intervals will be constructed at the 95% confidence level.  Data listings will be 
created to support each table and to prese nt all data collected. 
15.2 S ample Size and Power 
Dose Escalation :  The goal is to determine a dose level of INCB001158 for which the rate of 
DLTs is less than 33%.  Up to approximately 108 patients are plann ed for single agent dose 
escalation (Part 1a) a nd 108 patients for combination dose esca lation (Par t 1b), both including 
backfill patients. 
Dose Expansion:  For Expansion Cohorts in Parts 2 and 3 ( except the initial part of Cohort 2c), 
Simon's two-stage design ( Simon 1989 ) will be used as outlined in Table 15.2-1 below.  The null 
hypothesis that the true response rate is [p0] will be tested against a one-sided alternative .  In the 
first stage, [n1
] patients will be accrue d.  If there are [r1] or fewer responses in these [n1]

10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  121 
VV-CLIN -000684  patients, the stud y will be stopped.  Otherwise, [n - n1] additional patients will be accrued for a 
total of [n ].  The null h ypothesis will be rejected if [r2 + 1 ] or mor e responses are observed in [n ] 
patients.  This design  yields a type I error rate of 0.1 and power of 80%  when the true resp onse 
rate is [ p1].

Cohort 2c is designed to generate additional evidence of clinical activity in a variety of tumor 
types.  The sample size  for the initial  30 patients was not based on a predefined statistical 
analysis.   The sample size for each tumor type in any subsequent expansion of Cohort 2c will be 
guided by a Simon 2 -stage design.  
 
 
 
 
Part 1c is intended to enroll the minimum number of patients required to generate sufficient PK 
data for a descriptive comparison  of Day 1 and steady state (Day 8, Day 15) exposures between 
patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 -49 mL/mi n) and normal renal function (CrCl

VV-CLIN -000684  > 50 mL/min) .  Accor dingly, the sample size of 6  PK-evaluable patients for C ohort 1c is not 
based on a predefined statistical analysis.  
15.3 Analysis Populations  
15.3.1  Safety Population  
All patients who receive at least 1 dose of INCB001158  or pembrolizumab will be included in 
the analysis of safety, regardless of the duration of treatment.  
AE and laboratory data from all patients in the safety population will be evaluated for  safety.  
Patients from dose escalation  will be combined  with patients  receiving the same dose and 
schedule  from cohort expansion for safety evaluation.  Patients with moderate renal impairment 
in Part 1c will be evaluated separately.  Data will be tabulated to examine the  frequency, organ 
systems affected, and  relationship to study treatment s.  No formal interim analysis is planned; 
however, safety data will be examined on an ongoing basis to ensure safety of the study patients 
and compliance with the trial dose escalation and expansion rules.  
15.3.2  DLT -Evaluable Populations in Dose Escalation  
DLTs will be evaluated during dose escalation.  Unless doses are missed in Cycle 1 due to drug-
related AE (s), a patient must receive at least 75% of the planned INCB001158  doses (43 of 
56 total doses) to be considered evaluab le for DLT.  If a patient received less than 43 doses of 
INCB001158  in the first 28 days of treatment for reasons other than a DLT, the patient will be 
considered non -evaluable for DLT and replaced.  For patients in Part 1b and Part 3, p atients must 
receiv e both doses of pembrolizumab  in Cycle 1 in order to be evaluable for DLT.  
Patients who discontinue the study prior to receiving the requisite study treatment 
administrations for reasons that include, but are not limited to, clinical/radiographic progressi on, 
voluntary withdrawal, or complications that the Principal Investigator considers secondary to the 
patient’s malignancy will not be considered evaluabl e for DLT and will be replaced.  
15.3.3  Efficacy  Evaluable  Populations  
The Response Evaluable Population inclu des a ll patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
treatment (INCB001158 or pembrolizumab), completed a baseline scan, and met at least 1 of the 
following criteria:  
• The patient  had at least  1 post -baseline scan.

10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  123 
VV-CLIN -000684  • The patient discontinued from study trea tment for any reason except unrelated toxicity or 
death, or withdrawal of consent.  
The PFS Evaluable Population includes  all patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
treatmen t (INCB001158 or pembrolizumab) . 
Patients enrolled in the expansion cohorts who do not meet the requirements for the Response 
Evaluable Population will be considered non -evaluable fo r response and will be replaced . 
15.4 Efficacy Analysis  
Response to treatment  will be evaluated using RECIST v1.1  for patients with solid tumors 
(except for mesothelioma; Eisenhauer 2009 ).  For patients with pleural mesothelioma, response 
will be evaluated using the modified RECIST criteria for pleural mesothelioma ( Byrne 2004 , 
Attachment 5).  Responses for patients with pericardial or peritoneal mesothelioma will be 
described based upon RECIST v1.1 for patients with measurable disease combined with clinical 
improvements . 
The Ka plan-Meier method will be used to estimate the median Duration of Response (DOR)  and 
Progression -Free Survival (PFS) for each treatment cohort in Dose Expansion  (note : Dose 
Escalation patients of the same histology enrolled at the RP2D will be included in this analysis ).  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Efficacy Evaluable Population.  Additional efficacy 
analyses will also be performed on an expanded population that includes patients that lack post -
treatment scans due to toxicity or death . 
For ea ch patient  with objectively measurable disease, response to therapy, will be calculated  
using RECIST  v1.1 and Modified RECIST for pleural mesothelioma  (DOR , PFS,  Best Overall 
Response [BOR ], and Overall Response Rate [ORR ]). 
• DOR  is defined as the number of days from the date of initial response (PR or better) to 
the date of first documented disease progression/relapse or  death, whichever occurs first.  
• PFS is defined as the number of days from the date of treatment initiation (i.e., C1D1)  to 
the dat e of documented disease progression  or death from any cause, whichever occurs 
first, and will be calculated for all patients .  In the event that no disease progression or 
death is documented prior to study termination, analysis cutoff, or the start of 
confounding anticancer therapy, these endpoints will be censored at the date of last  
available tumor assessment.

VV-CLIN -000684  • BOR is the best RECIST  v1.1 /modified RECIST for pleural mesothelioma  response  
recorded from the start of the study treatment until disease progres sion/recurrence.  
• ORR is defined as the  response of the  proportion of efficacy evaluable patients with 
tumor size reduction from the time the start of  treatment until documented tumor 
progression.   ORR includes complete response (CR) and partial response (PR).  
 
 
15.5 Safety Analysis  
Safety variables to be analyzed  by dose level and tumor type  are A Es, laboratory test r esults 
(hematology , coagulation, serum chemistry , and urinalysis ), ECG, weight, and vital signs . 
Adverse event terms recorded on the eCRFs will be mapped to preferred terms using the most 
recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activit ies (MedDRA®).  All A Es 
will be summarized according to the system organ class and preferred term within the organ 
class.   Adverse events will be tallied for overall frequency (number and percentage of patients ), 
worst reported severity, and relationship t o study treatment  for each preferred term per patient .  
Serious adverse events will be similarly summarized.   Listings of deaths, SAEs, and A Es leading 
to early termination of study treatment or premature withdrawal from study will also be 
provided . 
Labora tory variables will be examined using mean change in value from baseline to scheduled 
time points.   The baseline value of a variable is defined as the last value obtained on or before 
the date and time of the first dose  of INCB001158  or pembrolizumab . 
ECG,  weight, and vital signs will also be summarized by changes from baseline to scheduled 
time points using descriptive statistics.  
15.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
For Part 1a - Dose Escalation PK samples, a  noncompartmental method of analysis will be used 
to analyze  the plasma concentrations of INCB001158 .  The maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) and the time to attain the C max (Tmax) will be determined directly from the observed data.  
In Part 1a,  full AUC (AUC 0-12 hr) will be calculated on Days 1 and 15 in Cycle 1.    
For Parts  1b, 2a, 2b, 2c,  and 3 , sparse sampling  will be collected to confirm exposure  and to 
explore population PK (see Attachment 1 A and 1B).

CONFIDENTIAL  125 
VV-CLIN -000684  For Part 1c, a noncompartmental method of analysis will be used to analyze the plasma 
concentrations of INCB001158.  The log -transformed PK parameters will be compared between 
renally impaired patients (CrCl 30 -49 m L/min) and patients with normal renal function (CrCl 
> 50 m L/min)  using an analysis of variance.  The geometric mean relative bioavailability and 
90% confidence intervals for INCB01158 C max and AUC will be calculated using the intra patient  
variability from the ANOVA model to assess the magnitude of the differ ence between the 
patients with normal renal function and those with moderate renal impairment.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
15.7 Precautions  
Although major adverse events are not anticipated, the Investigator must proceed with utmost 
caution.   Equipment, supplies, and properly skille d medical personnel must be immediately 
available for emergency use in the event of an unexpected reaction.   Patients must be selected 
carefully and closely monitored.  
For a complete description of preclinical studies of INCB001158 , please refer to the 
INCB001158  Investigator’s Brochure.   For a description of precautions with pembrolizumab ,

VV-CLIN -00068416.0 SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
16.1 Adverse Events  
16.1.1  Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an adverse event (AE) is def ined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, 
that occurs afte r a subject provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results 
occurring after informe d consent constit ute AEs only if they induc e clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considere d clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, he matologic abnormality that requires 
transfusion), or require changes in the study treatment(s). 
16.1.2 Re porting 
Adverse events that begin or worse n after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form of the eCR
F.  Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in the eCRF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for up to 30 day s after the last dose of study treatment or until the 
start of new anticancer therapy, whichever occu rs first.  Adverse events (including labor atory 
abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible 
rather than by individual underlying signs and sympt oms.  When a clear diagnosis cannot be 
identified, each sign or symptom shoul d be reported as a separate AE. 
The term "disease progression" shoul d be recorded as an AE/SAE only if there are no other 
identifiable AEs/SAEs associated with the disea se progression at the time of reporting.  For 
events associate d with disease progression, the releva nt sig ns and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  
When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, eac h sign or symptom should be reported as a 
separate AE.  
If the events resulting from disease progression meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, 
resulted in hospitalization, a life-threatening event, or death), the specific event(s) should be 
reported as an SAE(s) as described in Section 16.3.2.  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progressi
on), it should be indicated that each eve nt (reported a s a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms) is related to disease progression on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF. 
INCB001158  Protocol INCB 01158 -101 
10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
CONFIDENTIAL  127 
VV-CLIN -000684The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v4.03 Grades 1 through 5.  If an event is not 
classified by CTCAE, the severity of  the AE will be graded according to the scale below to 
estimate the grade of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self -care activiti es of daily living.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Fatal  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective questioning of the subject during the 
screening process after signing the ICF and at each visi t during the study.  Adverse events may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during the screening process or 
between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the 
extent possible, each AE shoul d be evaluated to determine:  
•The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to 5).
•Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study 
treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no).  
Relatedness will be assessed for each 
of INCB001158 (all Parts) and pembrolizumab (Parts 1b and 3 only).
•The start and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow-up.
•The action taken with regard to study drug.
•The event outcome (eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved,
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown).
•The seriousness, as per serious adverse event (SAE) definition provided in
Section  16.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements (see Section  16.3.2). 
All AEs shoul
d be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on the Adverse Event for m in the eCRF and the 
INCB001158  Protocol INCB 01158 -101 
10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  128 
VV-CLIN -000684  treatment should be specified on the Prior and Concomitant Medications or Procedures form in 
the eCRF.  
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judged to be 
permanent; assessme nt should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event, and the outcome.  
When the severity of an AE changes over time for a r eporting period (eg, between visits), each 
change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
2 separate AEs will be reported if a subject has Grade  1 diarrhea, meeting the definition of an 
AE, that lasts for 3  days before worsening to a Grade  3 severity.  The Grade  1 event will be 
reported as an AE with a start date equal to the day the event met the Grade  1 AE definition and 
a stop date equal to the day that the event increased in severity from Grade  1 to Grade  3.  The 
Grade  3 event will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event 
changed in intensity from Grade  1 to Grade  3 and a stop date equal to the day that the event 
either changed severity again or resolved.  
16.2 Laboratory Test Abnor malities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in the eCRF.  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, "anemia" instead of "low hemoglobin").  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate exp lanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal 
laboratory test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not 
necessary to separately record the laboratory test result as an additional event.

10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
CONFIDENTIAL  129 
VV-CLIN -000684Laboratory abnormalities that do not meet the definition of an AE shoul d not be reporte d as AEs.  
A Grade 3 or 4 AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition of 
serious, as defined in 
Section  16.3.1.  A dose modification for the laboratory abnormality may be 
required (see Section  12.1.3) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test 
abnormality as an SAE. 
16.3 S erious Adverse Events 
16.3.1  Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria:  
•Is fatal or life -threatening.
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless
hospitalization is a result of:
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied ind ication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.  
− An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the 
ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency out patient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospital admission.  
− Any social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the 
subject's general condition.  
− Results in persistent or signifi cant disability, incapacity, or a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.  
− Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
− Is considered to be an important medical event or a medically significant event 
that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the  outcomes listed above.

VV-CLIN -000684  16.3.2  Reporting  
For Parts 1a and 2, e very SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study 
drug(s) or study procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF 
through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or until the subject receives a new 
anticancer therapy (whichever occurs earlier ), must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) 
within 24 hours  of learning of its occurrence, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol.    
For Parts 1b and 3, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study  
drug(s) or study procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF 
through  90 days after the last dose of study treatment, or within  30 days after the last dose of 
study treatment if the subject receives a new anticancer therapy  (whichever occurs earlier ), must 
be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours  of learning of its occurrence, unless 
otherwise specified by the Prot ocol.   
Any SAEs occurring more than 30 days [Parts 1a and 2 only] or 90 days [Parts 1b and 3 only] 
after the last dose of study treatment should be reported to the sponsor or its designee only if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study  drug.   
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event form of the eCRF.  
The investigator must assess and record the causal relationship of each SAE to the study 
treatment.  Relatedness will be assessed for each of INCB001158 ( all Parts) and pembrolizumab 
(Parts 1b and 3 only).  
The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English, 
and send the completed and signed form to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the SAE .  The investigator must provide a causality assessment, that is, assess whether 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected 
(yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Com pleting the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form.  
The contact information of the sponsor's study -specific representatives is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new information regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SAE Report 
Form was sent.  Follow -up information is recorded o n an amended or new SAE Report Form,

CONFIDENTIAL  131 
VV-CLIN -000684  with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow -up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
SAE Report Form, such as  the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each 
recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow -up to 
that event, regardless of when it occurs.  
If the SAE is not documented in the IBs for the study treatments (new occurrence) and is thought 
to be related to at l east one of the study treatments, the sponsor or its designee may urgently 
require further information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities.  The sponsor 
or its designee may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all  investigators 
involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the 
competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC, 
or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.  
16.4 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the study 
treatment(s) may have interfered with the effectiveness of  a contraceptive medication or method.  
When a pregnancy has been confirmed in a patient during maternal or paternal exposure to study 
treatment(s), the following procedures should be followed in order to ensure subject safety:  
• The study treatment implicat ed must be discontinued immediately (female subjects 
only).  
• The investigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of the pregnancy.  
• A serum pregnancy test must be perfo rmed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.  
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy result, then:  
− The investigator will use his or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of 
the potential benefit/risk to the patient, to det ermine whether it is in the patient's 
best interest to resume study treatment and continue participation in the study.  
• The EOT visit evaluations must be performed.

VV-CLIN -000684  Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug sa fety 
evaluation.  Follow -up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or ne wborn complications, by following 
until the first well -baby visit.  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy form 
and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow -up information 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal 
relationship of each study treatment to any pregnancy outcome, as well as follow -up to the first 
well-baby visit or the duration specified in local regulations, whichever is later.  Refer to  the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form.  
Any SAE occurring during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form and 
submitted to the sponsor or designee.  
16.5 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor  
For this study, an overdose of each study treatment is defined as follows:  
• INCB001158:  A dose that is higher than the dose that patient has been intended to 
receive, which could be either the originally assigned dose (if not subseq uently modified) 
or a modified dose (eg, following a dose reduction).  
• Pembrolizumab:  A dose ≥ 1000 mg (5 times the dose).  
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of INCB001158 or 
pembrolizumab.  In the event of overdose, the pati ent should be observed closely for signs of 
toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
If an AE(s) is associated with ("results from") the overdose of study treatments, then the AE(s) is 
reported as an SAE, even  if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
All reports of overdose must be reported within 24 hours to the sponsor either by electronic 
media or paper.  
16.6 Warnings and Precautions  
Special warnings or precautions for the INCB001158 study drug and for pembrolizumab, derived 
from safety information collected by the sponsor or its designee, are presented in the 
Investigator's Brochure s (iIB, pIB).

The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or any par t of the study at any time for any 
reason.   If the Investigator suspends or terminates the study, the Investigator will promptly 
inform the Sponsor and the IRB/IEC and provide a detailed written explanation.   The 
Investigator will also return all study treatment s, containers, and other study materials to the 
Sponsor  or designee, or destroy the materials at the investigative site .  Upon study completion, 
the Investigator will provide the Sponsor, IRB/IEC, and regulatory agency with final reports and 
summa ries as required by regulations . 
If at least 6 months elapsed  since the last subject was enrolled in the study, and if there are no 
more than 10 subjects  still on study treatment , a database lock of the study may occur to allow 
the analysis of the study da ta.  Any remaining subjects  may continue to receive study treatment 
and be seen by the investigator per usual standard of care for this population.  The investigator 
will be expected to monitor for and report any SAEs  and pregn ancies, as detailed in Sectio n 16.0.

The Investigator will provide for the protection of the patients by following all applicable 
regulations.   These regulations are available upon request from the Sponsor.   The Informed 
Consent Form used during the informed consent process must be reviewed by the Sponsor and 
approved by the IRB/IEC.   All patients must be consented per the requirements and 
recommendations in 21C FR50, 45CFR46, and ICH/ GCP E6.  
The study begins when the first patient  signs the informed consent form.  The end of the study 
will occur when all patients have completed applicable follow -up assessments.  
Before any procedures specified in the protocol are performed, a patient must:  
• Be informed of all pertinent aspects of th e study and all elements of informed consent  
• Be given time to ask questions and time to consider the decision to participate  
• Voluntarily agree to participate in the study  
• Sign and date an IRB/IEC approved Informed Consent Form 
19.0 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
Any significant change in the study requires a protocol amendment.   An Investigator must not 
make any changes to the study without IRB/IEC and Sponsor approval . All protocol amendments 
must be reviewed and approved following the same process as the original pr otocol.  
20.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
The Sponsor or designee performs quality control and assurance checks on all clinical studies 
that it sponsors.   Before enrolling any patients in this study, Sponsor personnel and the 
Investigator review the protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure, the eCRFs and instructions for 
their completion, the procedure for obtaining informed consent, and the procedure for reporting

21.2 Accountab ility, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
The investigator is responsible for drug accountability at the study site; however, some of the 
drug accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.  
Inventory and accountabi lity records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by 
the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities.  
The investigator or designee must maintain records that document:  
• Delivery of study treatments to the study site.  
• Inventory of study treatments at the site.  
• Patient use of the study treatments including capsule or unit counts from each supply 
dispensed.  
• Return of the INCB001158 study drug to the investigator or designee by patients.  
The s tudy treatments must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator will 
also maintain records adequately documenting that the patients were provided the specified study 
treatments.  These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial 
numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the study treatments and study patients.  
Completed accountability records will be archived by the site.  The investigator or designee will 
be expected to collect and retain all used, unus ed, and partially used containers of study 
treatment until verified by the study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining 
study treatments back  to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional 
standard operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate on -site destruction of investigational 
supply, the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigationa l supply until 
the study monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and 
accuracy of accountability by the investigative site.  At sites where the study treatment is 
destroyed before monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the 
site SOP.

VV-CLIN -000684  Patient names will not be supplied to the sponsor or its designee.  Only the patient number and 
patient's initials (patient's initials will only b e recorded if allowable by local regulations) will be 
recorded in the eCRF, where permitted; if the patient's name appears on any other document (eg, 
laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the 
sponsor or it s designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with 
appropriate technical and organizational measures as required by local data protection laws.  The 
patients will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or its design ee, IRB or IEC, or 
regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and 
that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence 
and in accordance with local data prote ction laws.  
21.5 Financial Disclosure  
Before study initiation, all clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA 
Regulation Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 54 – Financial Disclosure by 
Clinical Investigators (ie, "cover ed studies") are required to submit a completed Clinical 
Investigator Financial Disclosure form that sufficiently details any financial interests and 
arrangements that apply.  For the purpose of this regulation, "clinical investigator" is defined as 
any in vestigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of 
research subjects, including the spouse and each dependent child of the clinical investigator or 
subinvestigator.  These requirements apply to both US and foreign clin ical investigators 
conducting covered clinical studies.  
Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also 
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Form.  During a covered clinical study, 
any changes  to the financial information previously reported by a clinical investigator must be 
reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered clinical study, the 
clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligations.  In the event that the clinical 
investigator is not reminded, they nevertheless will remain obligated to report to the sponsor or 
its designee any changes to the financial information previously reported, as well as any changes 
in their financial information for a perio d of 1 year after completion of the covered clinical study.

the study may be used by the sponsor, Incyte Corporation (Incyte), for the p urposes of national 
and international registration, publication, and information for medical and pharmaceutical 
professionals.  Study results will be published in accordance with applicable local and national 
regulations.  If necessary, the authorities wil l be notified of the investigator's name, address, 
qualifications, and extent of involvement.  The terms regarding the publication of study results 
are contained in the agreement signed with the sponsor or its designee.  A signed agreement will 
be retained  by the sponsor or its designee.  
Per the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors recommendations  (ICMJE  2015 ), an 
author is generally considered to be anyone who provides substantive intellectual contributions 
to a published study.  Specifically, authors hip credit should be based on 1)  substantial 
contributions to study conception and design, or acquisition, anal ysis an d interpretation of data, 
and 2)  drafting the article or revising it critically for import ant intellectual content, 3)  final 
approval of the  version to be published, and 4)  agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the

Sponsor’s Note: INCB001158 , may affect glucose metabolism in both normal and tumor tissues. 
Preclinical data suggest that glucose uptake may increase with arginase inhibition in sensit ive 
tissues, reflecting the pharmacodynamics effects of INCB001158 . False positive interpretations 
of progressive disease with FDG -PET scans may occur. Therefore, all FDG -PET findings 
suggestive of progressive disease should be confirmed by dedicated anato mic imaging (CT or 
MRI) for this study.  
Measurability of Tumor at Baseline  
Definitions  
At baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized measurable or non -measurable as follows.  
Measurable tumor lesions  
Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:   
•10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
•10 mm by caliper measurement (les ions which cannot be accurately measured with
calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)
•20 mm by chest X -ray
Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be  15 mm in short axis when assessed by C T scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will 
be measured and followed.  See also section below on ‘Baseline documentation of target and 
non-target lesions’ for information on lymph node measurement.  
Non-measurable tumor lesions  
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with  10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non -measurable 
lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or 
lung, peritoneal spread, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam 
that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.

CONFIDENTIAL  159 
VV-CLIN -000684  Special considerations regarding lesion measurability  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment:  
Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan or  plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft  tissue 
components , that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or 
MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the 
definition of measurability described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measu rable.  
Cystic lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, 
by definition, simple cysts.  
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
Lesions  with prior local treatment:  
• Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  For this proto col, these tumor lesions will be 
considered non -measurable lesions.  
Specifications by methods of measurements  
Measurement of lesions  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed.  All 
baseline evaluations sh ould be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never 
more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.

VV-CLIN -000684  Method of assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and re ported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions w ill only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and  10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  For the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
sugg ested.  As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, 
imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at 
the end of the study.  
Chest X -ray:  Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung. Still, non -contrast CT is preferred over chest X -ray. 
CT, MRI :  CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on t he assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  When CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans) . 
If prior to enrolment it is known that a patient is not able to undergo CT scans with IV contrast 
due to allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non -contrast CT or MRI (with 
or without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patien t at baseline and follow -up, should be 
guided by the tumor type under investigation and the anatomic location of the disease.  For 
patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the 
decision as to whether non -contras t CT or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed, 
should also be based on the tumor type, anatomic location of the disease and should be optimized 
to allow for comparison to the prior studies if possible.  Each case should be discussed with the 
radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the 
patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward . 
Ultrasound :  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the 
next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT 
or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead 
of CT in selected instances.

CONFIDENTIAL  161 
VV-CLIN -000684  Endoscopy, lapa roscopy :  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following comp lete 
response or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers :  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered i n complete response.  Because tumor markers are disease specific, instructions for 
their measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a disease specific basis.  Specific 
guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA resp onse (in 
recurrent prostate cancer), have been published.  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup 
has developed CA -125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor 
assessment for use in first -line trials in ovarian cancer.  
Cytology, histology :  These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare 
cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  When effusio ns are known to be a 
potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g., with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment can be considered if  the measurable tumor has met criteria for response 
or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive 
disease.  
Tumor response evaluation  
Assessment of overall tumor burden and measurable disease  
To assess obje ctive response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  Only patients 
with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where object ive tumor 
response is the primary endpoint.  Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one 
measurable lesion .  In studies where the primary endpoint is tumor progression (either time to 
progression or proportion wi th progression at a fixed date), the protocol must specify if entry is 
restricted to those with measurable disease or whether patients having non -measurable disease 
only are also eligible.  
Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non -target’ lesions  
When m ore than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  
INCB001158  Protocol INCB 01158 -101 
10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  162 
VV-CLIN -000684  This means in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of 
two (one site) and four lesions (two sites), respectively, will be recorded.  Other lesions in that 
organ will be recorded as non -measurable lesions (even if size is greater than 10 mm by CT 
scan).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements .  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
Lymph nodes  merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  The 
short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved 
by solid tumor.  Nodal size is normally reported as  two dimensions in the plane in which the 
image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, saggital or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis. 
For example, an abdominal  node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 
20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis  10 mm 
but < 1 5 mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters  (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target  
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characte rize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are  not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression.’  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case report form (e.g ., ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).

VV-CLIN -000684Response criteria  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response 
for target lesions.  
Evaluation of target lesions  
•Complete Response  (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
•Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as ref erence the baseline sum diameters.
•Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if
that is the smallest on study).  In addition t o the relative increase of 20%, the sum must
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or
more new lesions is also considered progression).
•Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR no r sufficient
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
Special notes on the assessment of target lesions  
Lymph nodes :  Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measur ement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), 
even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are 
included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete r esponse criteria 
are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. Case report 
forms or other data collection methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal lesions 
recorded in a separate section where, in order to qu alify for CR, each node must achieve a short 
axis < 10 mm.  For PR, SD, and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be 
included in the sum of target lesions.

10 NOV 2020  Amendment 2 -US 3  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  164 
VV-CLIN -000684  Target lesions  that become ‘too small to measure’ :  While on study, all lesions ( nodal and non -
nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes 
which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist 
may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to 
measure’.  When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the case report form:  
• If it is the opinion of the r adiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and 
is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned 
and BML (below measurable limit ) should be ticked (Note:  It is less likely that this 
rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when 
normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, 
if a lymph node is believed to be pr esent and is faintly seen but too small to measure, 
a default value of 5  mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well and BML 
should also be ticked).  
This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with 
varyi ng CT slice thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, 
therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon 
measurement error.  
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able t o provide an actual measure, that should be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm and in that case BML should not be ticked.  (BML is 
equivalent to a less than sign <)  
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment :  When non -nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longes t 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.

VV-CLIN -000684Evaluation of non -target lesions  
This section provides the d efinitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of non -target lesions.  While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they 
need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points 
specified in the protocol.  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
Special notes on assessment of progression of non -target disease  
The concept of progression of non -target disease requires additional explanation as follows:  
When the patient also has measurable disease :  In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal 
progression’ on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non -target disease in a magnitude that, even in presence of SD or 
PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
disconti nuation of therapy.   A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non -target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall 
progression solely on the basis of change in non -target disease in t he face of SD or PR of target 
disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
When the patient has only non -measurable disease :  This circumstance arises in some phase III 
trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease.  The same gen eral 
concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this instance there is no measurable disease 
assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non -measurable disease burden. 
Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be easily quantif ied (by definition:  if all lesions 
are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non -measurable disease is co mparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease:  i.e., an increase in tumor burden representing an 
additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion ).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an 
increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols 
as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’ .  If ‘unequivocal progression’  is seen, the patient 
should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  While it would be ideal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase mu st be substantial .

VV-CLIN -000684  New lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; howe ver, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal:  i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply  healing or flare of pre -existing lesions).  This is particularly 
important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is 
not. 
A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression .  An example of this is 
the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and whi le on study has a brain CT or MRI 
ordered which reveals metastases.  The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small si ze, continued therapy and follow -
up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
(18)F -Fluorodeoxyglucose Posi tron Emission Tomography (FDG -PET) For the purposes of 
this study, progressive disease should not  be made solely on FDG -PET findings because the 
mechanism of the study drug, INCB001158 , may affect glucose metabolism in both normal and 
tumor tissues.   All FDG -PET findings suggestive of progressive disease should be confirmed by 
dedicated anatomic imaging (CT or MRI).  The followi ng modifications to RECIST v1.1  will be 
applied to this study:  
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follo w-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  *Confirmation of the new lesion by CT or MRI scan is 
required per protocol.  
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: 
− If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new sign of disease 
confirmed by CT, this is PD  
− If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on 
CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the d ate of the 
initial abnormal *CT scan).  
− If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease 
on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
*reflects study -specific modification to RECIST v.1 .1

VV-CLIN -000684  Evaluation of best overall response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until 
the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation.  On occasion a 
response may not be documen ted until after the end of therapy so protocols should be clear if 
post-treatment assessments are to be considered in determination of best overall response. 
Protocols must specify how any new therapy introduced before progression will affect best 
response  designation.  The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings 
of both target and non -target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new 
lesions.  Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may 
also require confirmatory measurement.  Specifically, in nonrandomized trials where response is 
the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the ‘best overall 
response’.  This is described furthe r below.  
Time point response  
It is assumed that at each protocol specified time point, a response assessment occurs.  Table A  
provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who 
have measurable disease at baseline.  
When patients have non -measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table B  is to be used.  
Missing assessments and not -evaluable designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not 
evaluable at that time point.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, 
usually the case is also considered not evaluable at that time point, unless a convincing argument 
can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the 
assigned time point response.  This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.  
For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured lesions and at 
follow -up only two lesions were assessed, but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have 
achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion.  
If one or more target lesions were not assessed either because the scan was not done, or could  not 
be assessed because of poor image quality or obstructed view, the Response for Target Lesions 
should be “Unable to Assess” since the patient is not evaluable.  Similarly, if one or more non -
target lesions are indicated as ‘not assessed’, the response for non -target lesions should be 
“Unable to Assess” (except where there is clear progression).  Overall response would be 
“Unable to Assess” if either the target response or the non -target response is “Unable to Assess” 
(except where this is clear evidence  of progression) as this equates with the case being not 
evaluable at that time point.

a = If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease 
meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have 
reappe ared after CR). Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. 
However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still 
present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time poi nt. Under these circumstances, the 
original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.

VV-CLIN -000684  Special notes on response assessment  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ 
size (< 10 mm), they may  still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR  may 
not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).  
In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated ‘NE’ time point assessments may 
complicate best response determination.  The analysis plan for the trial must address how 
missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and progression.  For 
example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time point responses of 
PR-NE-PR as a confirmed response.  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
‘symptomatic deterioration’.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation  of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response:  it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The objective response status of 
such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non -target disease.  
Condition s that define ‘early progression, early death, and non -evaluability are study specific and 
should be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment 
periodicity).  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish resid ual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) before assigning a status of 
complete response.  FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to 
a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the 
protoco l and supported by disease specific medical literature for the indication.  However, it 
must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of 
FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes 
or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment.  If at 
the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression sh ould be the 
earlier date  when progression was suspected.

VV-CLIN -000684  ATTACHMENT 5 :  MODIFIED RECIST CRITERIA FOR MALIGNANT PLEURAL 
MESOTHELIOMA  
Source: modified from Byrne MJ and Nowak AK. 2004  
Evaluation of malignant pleural mesothelioma  will employ the RECIST v.1.1 criteria, but one of 
the organ site target measurements should reflect the typical mesothelial “rind” as one of the 
target measurements, as follows:  
• Tumor thickness perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum will be measur ed in two 
positions at three separate levels on transverse CT scan cuts.  
− The transverse cuts must be at least 2 cm apart and related to anatomical 
landmarks for future assessments.  
− The pleural thickness must be at least 10 mm to be considered measurable.  
• The sum of the six measurements defines a “pleural unidimensional measure”, similar to 
the “longest unidimensional diameter” of a target tumor mass per RECIST.  
• At disease reassessment, pleural thickness should be measured at the same positions and 
levels as  the Screening/Baseline tumor evaluation.  
Nodal, subcutaneous and other bidimensionally measurable lesions will be measured 
unidimensionally per the standard RECIST v 1.1 criteria.  
Objective responses are defined using RECIST v.1.1 criteria:  
• Complete Respo nse (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
• Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as r eference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progression)  
Confirmation of a response requires a repeat observation at least 4 week s apart.

As part of  Protocol Amendment 2 -US 3, dated 10 NOV  2020 , the irRECIST  endpoints have 
been  removed .  However, this attachment, describing irRECIST, has been retained, as 
patient management at the time of PD will continue to follow irRECIST principles  under 
Protocol Amendment 2 -US 3 . 
 
Source: Perrone A.  (Oral presentation at IO360 meeting, February 2016)  
 
Immune -related RECIST (irRECIST) is derived from RECIST v1.1 conventions, as described in 
Attachment 4  and Eisenhauer et al 2009 .  The implementation of irRECIST ( Perrone 2016 ) is 
identical to RECIST v1.1 until progressive disease (PD) is identified.  Upon demonstration of PD 
(see Attachment 4 ) per RECIST v1.1, patients may remain on study per Investigator discretion, 
assuming the patient  remains clinically stable, as defined in the protocol.  Patients that remain on 
study will have an imaging disease assessment performed at least 4 weeks after the initial PD is 
demonstrated in order to confirm PD . 
 
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS  
 
1.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Immune -related Complete Response (irCR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm. 
Immune -related Partial Response (irPR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of 
target lesions (i.e., Percentage Change in Tumor Burden) , taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters.

VV-CLIN -000684  Immune -related Progressive Disease (irPD):  Same requirements for PD as standard 
RECIST  v1.1, with exception th at progressive disease must be confirmed.  After demonstration 
of PD by standard RECIST v1.1 criteria, patients remain on study and are re -imaged after 
>4 weeks.  Confirmation of target lesion PD is constituted by the following:  
• Sum of linear diameters (SL D) reaches PD threshold of > 20% increase from 
nadir OR  
• SLD remains >20% increased above baseline (if already > 20% increased at 
initial PD)  
Immune -related Stable Disease (irSD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for irPR nor 
sufficient increase to q ualify for irPD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
1.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions  
 
1.1.1.1 Lymph Nodes  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible  by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
> 15 mm by CT scan . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum.  
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be 
recorded or followed.  
 
1.1.1.2 Target Lesions that Become “Too Small to Measure”  
All lesions (nodal and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their a ctual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). If the radiologist is 
able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.  
However, when such a lesion becomes difficult to ass ign an exact measure to then:  
• if it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the 
measurement  should be recorded as 0 mm.  
• if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be 
present and faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be

CONFIDENTIAL  174 
VV-CLIN -000684  assigned in this circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT 
slice thick ness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).  
1.1.1.3 Target Lesions that Split or Coalesce on Treatment  
• When non -nodal lesions ‘fragment ’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions 
should be added together to calculate the targe t lesion sum.  
• As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion”.  
1.2 Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
 
While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed on ly qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.  
 
Immune -related Complete Response (irCR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
 
Immune -related Non -CR/Non -PD (ir -Non-CR/Non -PD):  Persistence of one or more non -target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  This also includes 
non-target lesions that demonstrated unequivocal progression at the initial demonstration of PD 
but then stabi lized or regressed on subsequent scans.  
Immune -related Progressive Disease (irPD) :  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target 
lesions on a disease assessment subsequent to initial demonstration of PD.  Therefore, irPD by 
non-target lesions requires on e of the following on a disease assessment >4 weeks after the initial 
demonstration of PD:  
• New unequivocal progression   OR 
• Further unequivocal progression (if unequivocal progression present at initial PD)

assessment >4 weeks after the initial demonstration of PD:  
•New lesions a ppear OR
•Additional new lesions appear or prior new lesions grow (if new lesions were
present at initial PD)
1.4 Confirmation of Progressive Disease  
As described above, irPD requires that an initial demonstration of PD is confirmed in a 
subsequent disease  assessment performed >4 weeks after the initial demonstration of PD.  The 
above section describes what constitutes irPD with respect to Target Lesions, Non -target Lesions 
and New Lesions.  For the sake of clarity, the presence of ALL of the following >4 weeks after 
initial PD means that PD IS NOT  confirmed:  
Target lesions  
•SLD is <20% increased from nadir
Non-target lesions  
•No additional  unequivocal progression from prior scan
New lesions  
•No additional new lesions
•Any prior new lesions are stable or shrinking (qualitatively)

VV-CLIN -000684  2  RESPONSE CRITERIA  
 
2.1 Time Point Response  
 
A response assessment should occur at each time point specified in the protocol.  
 
• Immune -related Complete Response (irCR) : Complete disappearance of all tumor 
lesions (target and non -target), together with no new measurable or unmeasurable lesions, 
for at least  4 weeks from the date of documentation of irCR. All lymph nodes short axes 
must be < 10 mm.  
 
• Immune -related Partial Response ( irPR) : The sum of the  linear  diameters (SLD) of all 
target lesions is measured and captured as the sum of diameters at baseline. At each 
subsequent tumor assessment, the SLD  of all target lesions is calculated . A decrease  in 
SLD , relative to baseline SLD,  of 30% or greater is considered an irPR, in the absence of 
irCR  or irPD.  
 
• Immune -related Stable Disease (irSD) : irSD is defined as the failure to meet criteria for 
irCR, irPR or irPD . 
 
• Immune -related Progressive Disease (irPD) : It is recommended for patien ts that are 
clinically stable  to confirm PD at the following tumor assessment. Any of the following 
will constitute progressive disease:  
 
o Overall ir-response of irPD (per Table 2.1 ) after confirmation of PD with disease 
assessment >4 weeks after initial demonstration of PD  
o PD per RECIST v1.1 in a patient that is not clinically stable enough to remain on 
study for confirmation

VV-CLIN -000684ATTACHMENT  8:  AMENDMENT 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Amendment 2 of protocol INCB 01158 -101 (formerly CX -1158 -101) is being submitted in order to 
address four primary goals.  First, the anti -PD-1 agent is being changed from nivolumab to 
pembrolizumab.  Second, the patient populations in which the INC B001158/PD -1 combination is being 
studied are being expanded.  Third, the management of urinary orotic acid values has been modified 
based on the clinical experience to date, a more extensive evaluation of the urea cycle defect literature and 
feedback from  an expert in the management of urea cycle defects.  On the basis of these data, the 
threshold of acceptable urinary orotic acid elevations has been redefined for patients that are fasting and 
non-fasting at the time of the assessment.   
 
 In addition to these 
primary  goals of the Amendment, other minor changes have also been made to clarify protocol 
requirements.  
The following important changes were implemented to protocol INCB 01158 -101 (formerly known as 
CX-1158 -101) under Amendment 2:  
•Throughout:  The investigation al product identifier was changed from “CB  1158” to “INCB001158”
and the protocol identifier was changed from “Protocol CX -1158 -101” to “Protocol INCB 01158 -
101” to reflect the new partnership with Incyte Pharmaceuticals.
•Added - EudraCT number
•Throughout:  The design of the study was changed. INCB001158 is now tested in combination with
pembrolizumab instead of nivolumab. It is also tested as a monotherapy. In the appropriate sections
“pembrolizumab” replaces “nivolumab,” and instructions for administration  of pembrolizumab are
provided.

ULN, any OA value of > 40X ULN (fasting or non -fasting). Added rationale for urinary orotic acid
threshold.
•Section 8.3, Part 3 Combination Cohort Expansion: Revised criteria for entry into cohort 3b and
created 6 new cohorts, with all cohorts investigating INCB001158 in combination with
pembrolizumab; providing null hypotheses and primary endpoints for newly created cohorts.
•Cohort 3b: patients with melanoma with disease progression or prolonged st able disease while
receiving an anti -PD-1 agent in the immediate prior line of therapy

CONFIDENTIAL  184 
VV-CLIN -000684ATTACHMENT  9:  AMENDMENT 2 -EU EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The purpose of this amendment is to make additional changes and correct known  inconsistencies in the 
protocol.  The specific changes are as follows:  
Synopsis:   Updated the patient population for Part 2  to match the rest of the protocol.  
Synopsis; Attachments 1A and 1B:   Clarified scheduled visits  for each study part.  
Synopsis; Section 5  Study Design :  Updated study design schema to reflect that for cohorts 3a, 3b, 3c, 
and 3d, subjects must have received an anti -PD-1/PD -L1 agent in the most recent prior line of therapy for 
advanced/metastatic disease.  Previously subjects were required to have received  an anti -PD-1 agent in 
the most recent prior line of therapy.  The reason for the change is that anti -PD-1 and anti -PD-L1 agents 
target the same PD -1/PD -L1 interaction , and the effect of treatment with either type of agent is expected 
to be similar in thes e subjects . 
Synopsis; Section 5.1 Part 1. Dose Escalation ; Section 10.2.1 Rationale for Starting Dose :  Added the 
starting dose of 50 mg BID for the dose escalation of INCB001158 plus pembrolizumab in Part 1b, as this 
has now been determined in Part 1a as 2 dose levels below the RP2D of 100 mg BID.  
Synopsis; Section 7.1 Inclusion Criteria :  Broadened exception for PT and INR inclusion cutoffs to 
include patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation with drugs other than warfarin, as all of these drugs 
can affect PT and INR.  
Synopsis; Section 7.1 Inclusion Criteria, Part 1b Dose Escalation Criteria:  Removed reference to 
RCC and added mesothelioma, gastric/GEJ cancer, MSS CRC, MSI CRC, UCC, and SCCHN , to match 
the rest of the protocol . 
Synopsis; Section  7.1 Inclusion Criteria, Part 3  Expansion :   For Part 3a, corrected an inconsistency in 
bullet 2 to make consistent with exclusion of patients with EGFR or ALK mutations  
For cohorts 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d, specified that subjects must have r eceived an anti -PD-1/PD -L1 agent in the 
most recent  prior line of therapy for advanced/metastatic disease .  Previously subjects were required to 
have received an anti -PD-1 agent in the most recent prior line of therapy.  The reason for the change is 
that anti -PD-1 and anti -PD-L1 agents target the same PD -1/PD -L1 interaction, and the effect of treatment 
with either type of agent is expected to be similar in these subjects.  
Synopsis; Section 7.2 Exclusion Criteria:  Removed exclusion criterion #8 prohibiting patients with 
history of diverticulitis, intra -abdominal abscess, GI obstruction, and abdominal carcinomatosis from 
enrolling to the study.  This exclusion criterion has been limiting on a number of occasions to date on this 
study, as it  covers a lot of commonly occurring bowel pathology in patients, particularly those with GI 
malignancies.   There is no known safety concern with allowing such patients onto this study . 
Section 11.3.1 Distribution of Subject Reminder Cards and Subject Diaries; Section 13.4 
INCB001158 Accountability, Reconciliation, and Return; Section 13.5 Study Treatment 
Compliance:   Section 11.3.1  is new and describes s ubject reminder cards and diaries , which are being 
introduced in this study to facilitate drug compliance and the quantification  of that compliance.   
Sections  13.4 and 13.5 describe how the subject diaries will be used and how compliance will be

Treatments" and study drug was defined as INCB001158, and study treatments were defined as any 
mention of INCB001158 or pembrolizumab.  This has been clarified throughout the protocol where 
INCB001158 and/or pembrolizumab are mentioned.  
Section 13.1 Test Article Administration; Section 13.2, Packaging and Labeling:   Clarified that the 
pembrolizumab drug product may also be provided to sites as a 100 mg/4 mL (25 mg/mL) sterile solution 
in a sing le-dose vial.  
Section 16.0 Adverse Events:   This section has been replaced with equivalent section from the Incyte 
protocol template (Safety Monitoring and Reporting), to align with other Incyte -sponsored studies.  The 
new sub -sections are 16.1 Adverse Ev ents, 16.2 Laboratory Test Abnormalities, 16.3 Serious Adverse

VV-CLIN -000684ATTACHMENT  10:  AMENDMENT 2 -US EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Revisions from an EU -specific amendment (Amendment 2 -EU, see Attachment 9 ) have also been 
incorporated in this US-specific  amendment , with the exception of the item related to subject reminder 
cards and diaries.  
Amendment 2 -US of protocol INCB 01158 -101 has the following main goals:  
2.Expansion  of the Monotherapy b asket Cohort 2c
Since monotherapy expansion Cohort 2c is a basket cohort  enrolling multiple tumor types thought
to have infiltration with arginase -expressing cells, the current protocol does not have a
mechanism to further evaluate those tumor types in which INCB001158 monotherapy may show
evidence of clinical activity. Therefore, this amendment allows the option to expand the
monotherapy basket coho rt to enroll additional patients with a specific tumor type from part 2c
where INCB001158 shows meaningful clinical activity as a single agent.
The specific changes in Amendment 2 -US are as follows:  
 
 
Synopsis; Section 5.0: Overall Study Design:   
•Updated section on Part 2 single agent cohort expansion to show expansion of Part 2c basket
cohort and addition of Cohort 2d
•Corrected errors in sample sizes of Parts 3f and 3g expansion cohorts
•Updated study schematic to show expansion of Part 2c basket cohort and addition of cohort 2d
.
Synopsis; Section 5.2 Study Design:   Added subsections describing t he designs and patient populations 
for the existing and new Part 2 cohorts.  
Synopsis; Dosage and Mode of Administration:  Specified that INCB001158 may be taken orally using 
a capsule or tablet formulation in dose strengths of 25 mg or 100 mg.  
Synopsis: Study Schedule/Procedures:  Organized study visit days by study part.

For studies that have been ongoing beyond enrol lment of the final subject  where sufficient data have been 
collected to address the primary and secondary objectives, and only a limited number of subjects remain 
on study treatment, it is appro priate to discontinue protocol study assessments and data collection  (except 
for SAEs and  pregnancies)  for these active subjects, while allowing them to continue receiving  study 
treatment.  The main purpose of this US -specific amendment is to introduce language that will allow such 
a switch to take place.

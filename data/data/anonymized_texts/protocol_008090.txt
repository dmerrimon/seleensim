Page 3 of 12 1.0 Introduction  
To date a number of  studies have been performed to inform the design of the Motionsense wearable 
hardware and mobile application  (Figure 1). This wearable system will seek  FDA Class I status (see 
Appendix F1- 4) and allows evaluating the knee flexion angle during activities of daily living and during 
physiotherapy , while also tracking secondary metrics (often derived from the knee flexion) . This 
system consists of two sensor  nodes that are placed above and below the knee joint respectively. This 
is achieved by means of daily and weekly patch, whereby the weekly patches are first applied to the 
patients’ skin and intended to stay on for at least a week. Subsequently, the daily  patches connect the 
sensor nodes to these weekly patches. The sensor nodes shall thus be removed daily as they require daily (overnight) charging. A detailed description of the system is provided in Appendix A.  
 
Figure 1 – Schematic design of the Motionsense system consisting of sensor nodes (left), daily and 
weekly patches (middle) and mobile application (right).  
  
The data collected through the wearable and mobile app are shared with a cloud infrastructure, 
hereafter referred to as OrthoLogIQ. This is a HIPAA compliant database infrastructure that provides the surgeon and care team with remote access to the patient profile to review the daily activity data, 
assigned home exercise program and compliance therewith, pictures uploaded by the patient, …  
 
A primary outcome from these wearable devices is the knee range of motion, absolute knee flexion 
angle, knee active time, steps  and successful repetitions of prescribed physiotherapy exercises. These 
metrics are tracked and reported by the companying mobile application.  
 
During the proposed study, the MotionSense wearable system will be used by patients undergoing TKA 
surgery leading up to and after their surgery . The patients will be using the system to monitor their 
recovery during daily activities, log daily pain scores and patient reported outcomes while also 
supporting their prescribed home exercise program. Each patient will thereby participate in outpatient 
physiotherapy in line with their current standard of care, while the physiotherapist will leverage the 
opportunities of the presented platform to give the patient personalized reminders for their patient-

patients recovery remotely as the sensor / app data is shared to the OrthoLogIQ platform.   
 The primary goal of this observational study is to evaluate the usability of t he Motionsense system in 
a typical patient environment, while also documenting the physiotherapists’ decisions in advancing 
patients’ home exercise program .

3.1 Study Design  
The study is designed as a prospective, observational study including a maximum of 50 patients that 
are scheduled for  total knee arthroplasty and will be  participating in outpatient physiotherapy as part 
of their standard of care recovery pathway.  
 
The st udy aims to replicate an actual use scenario of the Motionsense system, involving longitudinal 
follow -up of the patients starting 2-4 weeks prior to surgery up to 90 days after surgery . Patients will 
be recruited through the surgeon clinic , and subsequentl y use the MotionSense system at home and 
in collaboration with their physiotherapist who will assign adequate exercises to the patient. At the 
end of their 90- day recovery window, the patients’ experience with the MotionSense system will be 
evaluated using  a phone interview by the research nurse.  
 
3.2 Patient Journey  
The patients will be using the Motionsense system for up to 120 consecutive days during this study. 
During the study, t he patients will be interacting with the principal investigator (PI) , 
physiot herapist (PT)  and research nurse (RN)  at the following time intervals:  
 
- Initial Checkpoint : patient consent and enrolment  
 Introduction to the study and patient consenting by Principal Investigator  
 System introduction (involving IFU – see Appendix A ) and  installation by Research  Nurse  
 Initial, pre -operative exercise prescription (by Surgeon)   
 Evaluation of comorbidities ( Charlson Comorbidity Index – Patient Reported ) 
 Evaluation of expectations  (HSS Expectations) 
 
- Pre-operative at home use:  prehab and questionnaires  
 Patient reported outcomes collected  through app : KOOS and PROMIS -10 questionnaires 
 Daily pain scores

 Usability questionnaire including Net Promoter Score  
 
 
Beyond these checkpoints with the health care professionals involved in the study, the patient will 
use the system on a daily basis and will be asked to fill out a daily pain score through the mobile application . The patient’s daily flow while at home will look as follows : 
- Wake -up 
- Application of the sensors on the leg  and sensor alignment  by resting the operated foot on a 
block and standing upright (support can be used in case of perceived instability – see Figure 2) 
- Activities of daily living registration  
- Home exercise completion  (exercises prescribed by supervising physiotherapist)  
- Sensor take -off  
- Charging sensors overnight so they are ready for next -day use

Page 8 of 12 3.3 Home Exercise Program  
A library of 12 exercises is provided in the MotionSense mobile application. The physiotherapist has 
the ability to select any of these exercises and appoint them to the patient for their home exercise 
program as deemed necessary by the clinician. This library of exercises was distilled from 
recommendations by the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and  in collaboration 
with consultant surgeons and physiotherapist. The exercises consist of:  
- Warm up  
- Knee straightening stretches  
- Sitting knee bends  
- Sitting assisted knee bends  
- Quad isometrics  
- Short arc quads  
- Long arc quads  
- Straight leg raises  
- Sit to stands  
- Heel slides  
- Prone hamstring curls  
- Standing knee bends  
The decision process of the physiotherapist in assigning these exercises will be documented in the journal that the physiotherapist is keeping ( referred to as PT Journal  - see Appendix C). Should 
exercis es that are outside of the abovementioned library be indicated for the individual patient, these 
exercises will be documented in the PT journal and assigned to the individual patient through the current standard of care.  
3.4 Setting  
All patients will be recruited under supervision of the principal investigator, Paul Jacob MD, from the 
Oklahoma Joint Reconstruction Institute.  A research  nurse  linked to the orthopaedic practice will manage the study participants, collect consent 
forms and assure completion of the forms.  A group of  physiotherapist s will also participate in the study  
to assign the relevant exercises to the patients and guide the patients’ recovery as part of their 
standard of care .  
3.5 MotionSense and OrthoLogIQ  
OrthoLogIQ is a cloud -based, HIPAA compliant data collection, dashboarding and reporting platform , 
which enables health care providers  to monitor their patients pre - and post -operatively with the use 
of the MotionSense w earable  and mobile application . Orth oLogIQ is designed to enable hospitals, 
practices and h ealthcare providers monitoring and collecting  various data points on their patient 
population throughout their episode of care. OrthoLogIQ users can collect a pre-operative  patient 
baseline (Comorbidit ies, patient reported outcomes , VAS p ain scores, activities of daily living , range 
of motion and correlate that to post-operative  outcomes surveys, activity levels , home exercise 
program c ompliance and patient satisfaction.  In addition, the dashboard provides health care providers 
with the ability to remotely monitor the recovery of their patients in terms of pain scores, daily activities, range of motion, exercise compliance etc.

Page 9 of 12 3.6 Materials  
For the duration of the study, the patient will be provided with:  
- Weekly patches:  these weekly patches go directly on the knee. Initially the patient will be 
provided with 9 x 2 weekly patches, upon request more weekly patches can be obtained through 
the surgeon clinic.  
- Daily patches: the daily patches are used to connect the sensors to the weekly patches and shall 
be replaced every time the sensors come off the leg. Initially the patient will be provided with 6 3 
x 2 daily patches though refill packs can be provided through the surgeon clinic should the patient run out of patches.  
- Box: including two sensor nodes, a charger with power cord, instructions for use and a sensor 
alignment block  
 The accompanying MotionSense mobile application will be available for download through the app 
store. The patient will be assisted with this installation process by the research nurse involved in 
onboarding the patient.  
3.7 Participants  
The study participant will represent a range of typical intended users of the Motionsense System . More 
specifically, the following selection criteria will be used : 
- Planned to undergo  unilateral total knee surgery in the coming 4 weeks  
- Age 50 to 80 
- BMI not exceeding 35  
- Owns a smartphone (agnostic to brand or type)  
- Patient does not have severe skin conditions that would potentially result in irritation or harming the skin when applying the weekly patches.  
 Beyond that, the study should aim to recruit patients with various socio- economic backgrounds, 
various levels of motivation as well as a wide range of educational level.  
 
A total of 50 participants will be recruited for the study . Recruitment for this study will be managed 
by the Principal Investigator . Through the orthopaedic practice, t he surgeon  office has regular access 
to patients matching the profile of intended users. In addition, the surgeon has close contact with the 
participating physiotherapist s while the research nurse is employed by the surgeon office. Participants 
will provide their written informed consent prior to participation (Appendix F ).

Page 10 of 12 3.8 Data Collection  
 
In general, the data collection in this study is focused on assessing the primary and secondary goals of the study  as listed in section 2.0 . This leads to various sources of data collection:  
- Patient journal:  pre-operatively, the patient will fill out a number of  questionnaires on paper 
form to frame potential comorbidities / socio- economic status / expectations.  
- Physiotherapist journal : the physiotherapist will fill out a document following each 
physiotherapy visit to document the prescribed exercises along with  the motivation for assigning 
these exercises and setting the targets for these exercises .   
- Wearable & App data capture: during the patients’ daily use of the wearable and interaction 
with the mobile application, the sensor will capture activities of the patients’ daily life as well as their exercise completion  by storing a series of variables on the patient’s phone and sharing this 
data to a HIPAA compliant database . More specifically, this data capture involves: 
 ADL: the patients ’ activities of daily liv ing is captured by the sensors, involving an hourly 
histogram of the patients knee flexion angle, an hourly total of a patients’ active minutes, an hourly total of a patients’ weight bearing time, an hourly total of a patients’ time wearing the 
sensor.  
 Gait: at predefined time intervals (2 x per week), the patient will be prompted to walk for 1 
minute while the sensors log the raw signals and share this data with the OrthoLogIQ database. This data can be further evaluated from cloud, looking at cadence, range of motion during 
gait, …  
 Exercises: the performed exercises and completion of the daily exercises will be recorded by 
the mobile application.  
 Pain scores: the patient will be asked to report their daily  pain scores through the mobile 
application.  
 Patient Reported Outcomes: patients will be asked to complete a K OOS and PROMIS -10 
questionnaire through the mobile application at distinct time intervals  throughout their 
recovery pathway.  
- Patient interviews  
 At the end of the  study, the patient will join a  phone  interview while  responding to a series of 
usability questions specific to their use of MotionSense during the recovery after surgery. In 
addition, the patient will be asked about any complications and/or re -admissions that they 
experienced during their 90d recovery window after surgery .

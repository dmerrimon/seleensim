Study Title: A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study of BBI608 Administered with 
Paclitaxel in Adult Patients  with Advanced Malignancies
Study Number: BBI608-201
Study Phase: Ib/II
Study Drug BBI608, an investigational small molecule anticancer drug, that i s hypothesized 
to affect multiple oncogenic cellular pathways, including inhibition of the 
STAT3 pathway, which has been implicated in cancer stem cells vi ability.
Primary Objective: To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended Phase 2 d ose (RP2D) of 
BBI608 when administered with paclitaxel in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies
Secondary 
Objectives:To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BBI608 and paclitaxe l when 
administered in combination.
To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608 when ad ministered in
combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced malignancie s.
To assess the objective response rate (ORR), disease control ra te (DCR), 
progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of p atients with 
selected tumor types treated wit h BBI608 in combination with pa clitaxel.
To determine the pharmacodynamics (biomarkers) of BBI608 when tu mor 
biopsy is possible.
Study Design: This is an open label, multi-center, dose escalation study of B BI608 administered 
in combination with a fixed dose of paclitaxel administered IV w eekly at 80
mg/m2given as a 1 hour infusion; A cycle will consist of daily and con tinuous 
oral administration of BBI608 for four weeks in combination wit h paclitaxel 
administered IV weekly on day 3, 10 and 17 of each 28 day cycle.  I f  
administration of paclitaxel is discontinued due to paclitaxel- related toxicities, 
the administration of BBI608 will be continued until disease pr ogression if 
tolerated. The doses of BBI608 will escalate in three patient co horts until a RP2D
is reached.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be performed for patients enrolled at selected study 
sites in the first cycle of the study. 
Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed in patients with a ccessible 
tumors when tumor biopsy is possible. 
Safety and tolerability of BBI608 in combination with paclitaxe l will be assessed 
for the duration of study treatment.  
Evaluation of preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608 in combi nation with 
paclitaxel will be performed at regular intervals while patients  remain on study. 
Study Population: This study is conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom weekly 
paclitaxel is an acceptable option;  including, ovarian cancer, ca ncer, breast 
cancer, NSCLC, melanoma, and gastric and esophageal adenocarcino ma.
Currently the study is only enrolling patients with thymic carci noma.
All patients must have a histologically or cytologically confir med malignancy

continuous daily dosing, dose escalation will stop and an addit ional three patients 
will be enrolled for a total of six patients treated at the pri or dose level. 
The MTD is defined as the dose level at which no more than one out of six 
patients has an observable DLT. 
Duration of Treatment: For an individual patient, treatment with BBI608 and paclitaxel w ill continue 
until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or another disc ontinuation 
criterion is met.  It is expected that the majority of patients will receive between 
one and four cycles of BBI608 and paclitaxel for a treatment peri od of four to 16 
weeks. 
Patients may continue protocol therapy or BBI608 alone beyond radio logic
progression provided there is no clinical deterioration.  
Criteria for 
Determination of 
Dose-Limiting Toxicity:A DLT is defined by the occurrence of any of the following toxi cities possibly 
or probably related to BBI608, or BBI608 in combination with pa clitaxel within 
28 days of treatment:

clinically significant  hazard to the patient.
Whether a DLT has occurred will be assessed for each patient at  D a y  2 9  
following the first 28 days of BBI608 therapy.  DLT will be dete rmined from 
adverse events, changes from bas eline in physical examination f indings and 
laboratory parameters.  The incidence of adverse events and DLT s will be 
evaluated for each dose leve l and for all patients.  
Adverse events considered related to paclitaxel will not be cons idered DLTs.
Pharmacokinetic 
and 
Pharmacodynamic 
Variables:Pharmacokinetic variables to be determined include maximum plas ma drug 
concentration (Cmax), volume of distribution, area under the ti me-concentration 
curve (AUC), distribution half-l ife, and terminal half-life.  F or patients enrolled 
at select study sites, blood samples for PK determination will b e drawn on Day 
16 and Day 17 during the first cycle for each dose level.  Respon se (increase or 
decrease) of several biomarkers from biopsied tumors following BBI608
administration will be examined in patient with accessible tumor s for biopsy .  
Tumor biopsies will be collected prior to the first dose of BBI 608 and on day 17
of the first cycle for patients with accessible tumors and who h ave signed the 
optional tumor biopsy consent.
Statistical Methods: All patients receiving at least one daily dose of BBI608 will b e considered 
evaluable for safety analyses.  In addition to the evaluation a nd categorization of 
adverse events, listin gs of laborator y test results collected at baseline and durin g

those laboratory tests over time will be presented.
Patients who have received at least one cycle of BBI608 and hav e had at least 
one disease assessment following the initiation of therapy will  be considered 
evaluable for response.  The anti- tumor activity will be evaluated on an 
exploratory basis and will be summarized using descriptive stat istics or graphics.
For each tumor type, the following endpoints will be summarized : Objective 
response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with a documented 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST  1.1; Disease 
Control Rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients with documented CR, 
P R  a n d  s t a b l e  d i s e a s e  ( S D )  b a s e d  o n  R E C I S T  1 . 1 ;  p r o g r e s s i o n  f r e e survival 
(PFS); and overall survival (OS).
There is no statistical hypothesis testing in the Phase II part  a nd  t he  pl a n ne d 
sample size of Phase II (20 - 40 per cohort) is considered to be  clinically adequate 
to assess tolerability, safety, and preliminary anti-cancer act ivity of study drugs 
of interest, and actual sample size depends on the actual enrol lment in each arm.
Sample Size Justification for Thymic Carcinoma Cohort:
A total of 10 (minimum) to 15 (m aximum) patients will be target ed to this cohort 
and a Bayesian posterior probability approach will be employed t o monitor the 
enrollment based on the overall response rate (ORR) by Week 16.  After the first 
10 patients have response evaluation, or withdraw, or die by We ek 16, the 
Bayesian posterior probability of the ORR being greater than a target value will 
be continuously evaluated. If the posterior probability is grea ter than 70% or less 
than 20%, then further enrollment may be stopped. Otherwise enro llment will 
continue until the enrollment cap of 15 is reached. The targete d ORR is set to 
be 0.45 for the thymic carcinoma cohort. The Bayesian approach i ncorporates 
the historical data into the decision process by employing a we akly informative 
beta prior on the ORR by Week 16 where the beta prior is chosen  to have the 
mean equal to the historically observed ORR of 0.22 (Lemma 2011 ).

Confidential Page: 121 PRECLINICAL SUMMARY AND STUDY RATIONALE 
1.1 Scientific Background of BBI608
Recent studies have uncovered the presence of cancer stem cells  (CSC, also called tumor initiating cells 
or cancer stem-like cells) which have self-renewal capability a n d  a r e  c o n s i d e r e d  t o  b e  
potentiallyresponsible for malignant growth, relapse and metast asis. Importantly, CSCs are inherently 
resistant to conventional therapies. Therefore, a targeted agen t with activity against cancer stem cells 
for cancer patients is being explored (Lobo, Shimono et al. 2007;  Boman and Wicha, 2008;  Please find 
a list of updated reviews on cancer stem cells in all major can cer types in the special issue of Journal 
of Clinical Oncology on cancer stem cells (J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun 10;26(17)).
BBI608 is a small molecule that is hypothesized to affect multi ple oncogenic cellular pathways, 
including inhibition of the STAT3 pathway. 
STAT3 is an oncogene that belongs to a family of transcription f actors activated in response to 
cytokines and/or growth factors to promote proliferation, survi val, and other biological processes.  
STAT3 activates certain genes involved in tumorigenesis, invasio n, and metastasis, including Bcl-xl, 
Akt, c-Myc, cyclin D1, VEGF, and survivin.  STAT3 is aberrantly active in a variety of human cancers, 
including in more than half of breast and lung cancers, hepatoc ellular carcinomas, and multiple 
myelomas and more than 95% of head/neck cancers. STAT3 ablation by gene targeting blocks cancer 
cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. 
While essential for embryonic deve lopment, the deficiency of ST AT3 seems well tolerated in adult 
mice. Patients with Job’s syndrom e survive into adulthood with S TAT3 dominant negative mutations.
In a French registry study of 60 patients with Job’s syndrome, 93% were alive at age 50 (Chandesris et 
al, 2012).
Therefore, blocking STAT3 may target cancer stem cells as well a s the bulk of the heterogeneous cancer 
cells while potentially spare normal cells and normal adult stem c ells
1.2 Preclinical Efficacy
Cancer stem cells are intrinsically resistant (more than 5 to 1 0 fold) to chemotherapeutic drugs. BBI608 
has activity (~100 to 500 nM) against cancer stem cells in vitro while sparing normal hematopoietic 
stem cells (IC 50not reached at 30 PM) in vitro. BBI608 has demonstrated in vitro activity in human 
cancer cell lines derived from m ultiple tumor types with IC 50s ranging from 0.300 μM to 14 μM..
1.3 GLP Toxicology

Confidential Page: 131.4 Safety and Signs of Antit umor Activity in Phase I
A phase 1 dose escalation study (BBI608-101) in adult patients wit h advanced cancer was initiated to 
determine the safety, tolerab ility, recommended phase 2 dose (R P2D), pharmacokinetics and 
preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608. A modified Simon acc elerated titration scheme was used 
for dose escalation, with a cycle consisting of twice-daily ora l administration of BBI608 for 4 weeks, 
and was repeated every 4 weeks (28 days) until progression of di sease, unacceptable toxicity, or other 
discontinuation criteria were met.
The dose of BBI608 has been escalated from 20 mg to 2000 mg/day wh en BBI608 was taken bid, and 
MTD is not reached. The total daily dose has been escalated to 1500 mg (total daily dose) when BBI608 
was taken tid, and MTD is not reached. Further dose escalation is limited by pill burden and 
gastrointestinal events.

Confidential Page: 174 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design
This is an open-label, multicente r Phase Ib study of oral BBI608  administered with paclitaxel to patients 
with advanced malignancies. The s tudy is designed to explore th e safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics of BBI608 and paclitaxel and define a recommen ded Phase 2 dose.
Treatment will be initiated at a dose level of 1000 mg total dai ly dose of BBI608 for BID regimen and 
escalate until the RP2D or MTD is determined. In each cycle, BBI 608 will be taken daily continuously 
for 4 weeks (28 days).  BBI608 will be administered daily one h our prior or two hours after meals with 
the first dose taken in the morning.  On day 3, 10, and 17 of ea ch 28 day cycle, patients will receive
paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2given as a 1 hour infusion at 3 hours after taking the first morni ng dose of 
BBI608.
Cycles (28 days) will be repeated until progression of disease, u nacceptable toxicity, or another 
discontinuation criterion is met.  In the case of toxicity, adj ustment is permitted. 
Dose escalation will be perform ed using three-patient cohorts a s shown in the table below
Phase Ib Dose escalation scheme for BBI608 
CohortTotal Daily Dose   
(mg)Number of 
Patients
Ib 1000 3a
IIb 1500 3a
IIIb 2000 3a
aIf a DLT is observed, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled a t the same dose
If no DLT is seen, three additional patients will be enrolled a nd treated at the next BBI608 dose level.  
If one of the three patients in a cohort shows a DLT in the fir st cycle of therapy, an additional three 
patients will be enrolled at the same dose level.  
The MTD is defined as the dose le vel at which no more than one patient with DLT is observed among 
six patients.  If MTD is not reached, the recommended Phase 2 do se (RP2D) of BBI608 will be
determined by the maximally admin istered dose or a dose level w hich gives the best exposure.
Phase Ib will end when there are < 2 patients with DLT out of 6  evaluated for DLT at the regimen 
selected for use as RP2D.

<1 out of 6 at highest dose level 
below the maximally administered doseThis is the recommended phase 2 dose.  
4.2 Rationale for Study Design 
Considerable data has been col lected from the Phase I monothera py study of BBI608 (Protocol BBI608-
101) conducted in advanced oncolo gy patients who have failed mu ltiple previous regimens.  Dose 
escalation for BBI608 has been s uccessfully conducted from a tot al daily dose of 20 mg to 2000 mg 
total daily dose. Further dose es calation is limited by pill burd en. MTD is not reached. 
Combination of cancer stem cell therapeutics with chemotherapy would allow simultaneous inhibition
of cancer stem cells as well as non-stem regular cancer cells. Accordingly, preclinical xenografted 
models in mice treated with BBI 608 in combination with paclitax el showed dramatic synergy with 
tumor regression or cure observed in mice.
4.3 Selection of Dose 
The dose escalation of BBI608 in the BBI608-101 Phase I study h as reached a total daily dose of 2000 
mg without dose-limiting toxicity. No MTD was reached and furthe r dose escalation above 2000 mg 
total daily dose is limited by pill burden . Adverse events observed in the  BBI608-101 phase I trial have 
b e e n  g e n e r a l l y  m i l d  w i t h  t h e  m o s t common being: diarrhea, nause a ,  a n d  f a t i g u e .   G r a d e  3  e v e n t s  
include: fatigue or diarrhea. No bone marrow suppression or neurop athy was observed.
In the BBI608-201 study, dose escalation of BBI608 will be begi n at a dose of 500 mg bid with a total 
daily dose of 1000 mg, in combination with 80 mg/m2of paclitaxel weekly. The starting dose of 
BBI608 will be at 600 mg (total daily dose) for tid regimen. The dose escalation schedule of BBI608 
is presented in Section 4.1.
Boston Biomedical, Inc 10 May 2018
BBI608-201 Clinical Protocol 4 Amendment #4.0
Confidential Page: 194.4 Risk Benefit Assessment
Cancer stem cell inhibitors offer one approach to the treatment  of advanced malignancies. Preclinical 
studies of BBI608 indicate that the drug is active against a ra nge of solid tumors.  Signs of antitumor 
activity have been observed in the BBI608-101 phase I trial. 
BBI608 has been well tolerated in phase I trials. MTD was not r eached in the BBI608-101 Phase I study 
with doses escalated from 20 mg up to 1000 mg bid (2000 mg total daily dose). Further dose escalation
above 2000 mg/day is limited by pill burden. 
Adverse events observed in the BBI608-101 phase I trial have be en generally mild with the most 
common being: diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue.  Grade 3 events in clude: fatigue or diarrhea. There is no 
clinically significant overlap b etween adverse events observed for BBI608 and the adverse effects of 
paclitaxel. 
The sponsor believes that the p roposed study is acceptable in t he context of its risks and benefits.
4.5 Criteria for Dose Escalation a nd Determination of Dose-Limit ing Toxicity
Evaluable patients are defined as having been exposed to at lea st 28 days of continuous daily 
administration of BBI608.   Based on the tolerability and safet y of evaluable patients, enrollment at the 
next dose level and/or additiona l patients into the ongoing coh ort will occur according to criteria 
described below: 
xIf zero treated patients experience a DLT (defined below) by Da y 28, then dose escalation will 
occur.
xIf one treated patient experiences a DLT by Day 28, then an add itional three patients will be 
enrolled for a total of six patients treated at the same dose l evel.  Escalation will occur if no 
additional DLTs are seen in that cohort (one out of six patient s) 
xIf two or more treated patients at a dose level experience a DL T by Day 28, dose escalation 
will stop and this dose level w ill be considered the maximally administered dose.
The BBI medical Monitor and Principal Investigator will review all significant relevant toxicities to 
determine if the dose escalation schedule requires modification .  Intermediate doses may be assigned 
to a cohort after agreement betw een the BBI Medical Monitor and  the Principal Investigator. 
4.6 Dose-Limiting Toxicity
Dose-limiting toxicity is defined by the occurrence of any of t he following toxicities possibly or 
probably related to BBI608 within 28 days of treatment.  DLT wil l be scored during the 28 days of 
BBI608 treatment. 
xGrade 4 hematological toxicity
xGrade 3 or 4 non-hematol ogical toxicity, except: 
oGrade 3 or 4 nausea/vomiting/anorexia, diarrhea or fatigue will be  considered a DLT 
only if it persists more than three (3) days despite optimal medi cal management
oAlopecia will not be considered a DLT
Adverse events considered rela ted to paclitaxel will not be con sidered DLTs
4.7 Study Duration 
Patients will receive treatment with BBI608 and paclitaxel until progression of disease, unacceptable 
toxicity or another of the disc ontinuation criteria is document ed (see Section 5.6).  It is expected that
most patients will receive between one and four cycles of BBI60 8 and paclitaxel for a treatment period 
of four to 16 weeks.

5.4 Tumor Evaluation Visits
Disease status and tumor respons e will be assessed in eight-wee k intervals up to one year after starting 
therapy (calculated from the first dose of BBI608) or as clinic ally indicated. Standard imaging studies 
should be performed according to institutional procedures. Tumo r response for solid tumors will be 
evaluated using the guidelines for Response Evaluation Criteria  in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) outlined 
in Section 9.
Once progression of disease during therapy is documented, patie nts may receive any therapy as 
determined by their treating physician (see Section 5.6).
A protocol radiologic assessment consists of computed tomograph y (CT) imaging of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis with IV contrast.  Non-contrast imaging is a llowed in patients with an allergic 
reaction to IV contrast material despite appropriate use of pre medication, provided the tumor lesions 
can be measured and followed reproducibly, according to the inv estigator.  An alternate method for 
those with allergy to CT contrast  material is an MRI of the abd omen and pelvis and a non-contrast CT 
of the chest.  
Images should continue to be obt ained every 8 weeks (56 days) f rom the first dose of BBI608 until 
radiologic disease progression is documented. A window of ± 7 d ays is allowed when scheduling scans.

confirmatory scan, imaging will continue every 8 weeks (56 ± 7 days).  
De-identified digital copies of r adiologic images may be reques ted for the purposes of exploratory 
review. 
5.5 End of Study Evaluation
All patients will be followed for a minimum of 30 days after th e last dose of BBI608.  If a patient is 
removed from the study due to drug-related adverse events, the patient will be followed until resolution 
of any drug-related AE occurri ng during the study or within 30 days of the last BBI608 dose, or for 30 
days, whichever is longer.  In the presence of toxic effects, f ollow-up visits will be required every four 
weeks until all study related toxicities have resolved to basel ine 
(or < Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Gr ade 1), stabilized or are deemed 
irreversible.

Confidential Page: 256.5 Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
Pre-clinical studies conducted at  BBI have identified several b iomarkers in tumor tissues whose levels 
either increase or decrease upon exposure to BBI608.  Tumor biop sies will be collected as described 
below provided the patient has accessible tumor and has signed t he optional tumor biopsy consent.  The 
goal of the proposed biomarker study is to examine the response  of biomarkers in patients treated with 
BBI608.  For tumor biopsies, tumor samples will be obtained befo re and after dosing in selected 
subjects. Subject tumor samples  will be processed for determina tion of pharmacodynamic markers in 
malignant tissue by histopathology and flow cytometry.
6.5.1 Tumor Biopsy
Patients who are identified by the Principal Investigator as ha ving a lesion, which could be biopsied 
with a minimally invasive procedure, will be asked to sign an a dditional consent.  Tumor samples 
should be collected at baseline and approximately 4 h after admi nistration of the BBI608 morning dose 
on Day 17. Collection, storage, and shipping of tissue samples wi l l  b e  p e r f o r m e d  a s  d e s c r i b e d  i n

paclitaxel should be reduced according to the following criteria :
xFor ANC 0.5-1.49×109/L or platelet count 50-99.0×109/L, hold paclitaxel dose until recovery 
(ANC t1.5×109/L and platelet count t100 × 109/L) then recommence on the same schedule 
and dose. Neupogen/G-CSF may be u sed at the discretion of the p rincipal investigator.
xFor ANC <0.499×109/L or platelet count <50.0 × 109/L, hold paclitaxel dose until recovery 
(ANC t1.5 ×109/L and platelet count t100×109/L) then recommence on the same schedule but 
reduce the dose level by 20%.
Prior to subsequent paclitaxel do ses in a given cycle, the abso lute neutrophil count (ANC) must be t1.0
× 109/L and the platelet count must be t100 × 109/L.  If these parameters are not met, and in the opinion 
o f  t h e  i n v e s t i g a t o r  t h e  m y e l o s u p p r e s s i o n  i s  m o s t  l i k e l y a  r e s u l t  of paclitaxel therapy, the dose of 
paclitaxel should be reduced according to the following criteri a:
xFor ANC 0.5-0.99×109/L or platelet count 50-99.0×109/L, hold paclitaxel dose until recovery 
(ANC t1.0×109/L and platelet count t100 × 109/L) then recommence on the same schedule 
and dose. Neupogen/G-CSF may be used at the discretion of the p rincipal investigator.
xFor ANC <0.499×109/L or platelet count <50.0 × 109/L, hold paclitaxel dose until recovery 
(ANC t1.5 ×109/L if the first of a cycl HRWKHUZLVH$1&î 109/L; and platelet count 
t100×109/L) then recommence on the same schedule but reduce the dose le vel by 20%.
If a dose of paclitaxel is held, it may be administered on an al ternate week upon count recovery such 
that weekly administration of p aclitaxel for 3 of every 4 weeks  is maintained.
Patients who experience severe peripheral neuropathy and in the  opinion of the investigator the 
peripheral neuropathy is most lik ely a result of paclitaxel the rapy, the dose of paclitaxel should be 
reduced by 20% for subsequent doses of paclitaxel.
7.2.1 Additional Recommendations
The above are considered minim um guidelines.  The paclitaxel do se may be adjusted by the clinical 
investigator for adverse events o ther than those specifically me ntioned above.  
In addition, if a toxicity has occurred for either BBI608 or pac litaxel, subsequent dosing may be delayed 
up to two weeks with the following conditions: 
xIf the toxicity resolves WRJ rade 2 or to the baseline grade, dosing may resume at the curre nt 
dose level.
xIf criteria for treatment are still not met, the patient may be  removed from the protocol.
Boston Biomedical, Inc 10 May 2018
BBI608-201 Clinical Protocol 4 Amendment #4.0
Confidential Page: 28Patients should continue to be treated using the same dosing re gimen prescribed for the cohort in which 
they were originally enrolled.  I f breaks in treatment are requ ired the following guidelines should be 
used:
xPatients experiencing an AE or po tential DLT should resume trea tment, if possible, using 
an alternative-dosing schedule (to be discussed with the Sponso r medical monitor).
Patients who cannot tolerate their assigned dose after trying a n alternative schedule should be 
replaced if they have not complete d their first cycle (and are therefore not evaluable for 
determination of dose escalation).
For any BBI608-related intolerabl e grade 3 or intolerable grade  2 adverse event, persisting despite 
optimized medical management, a dose holiday of 1-3 days follow ed by dose modification is 
recommended. Dose modification may include reduction of the tot al daily dose and/or in the number 
of doses taken per day.  Investigators should discuss dose modi fications with the medical monitor for 
the sponsor.  Patients may up-titrate dose to full dose as tole rated.
If a toxicity is thought by the Investigator to be related to bo th BBI608 and paclitaxel, then the dose 
modification rules for both agents should be followed.
7.2.2 Supportive Pharmacology

7.3 Treatment Compliance
A patient is considered complia nt with the study protocol when study medication is administered at a 
compliance level of greater than 80%.  
BBI608 compliance will be calcula ted using the following equati on:
(Number of capsules actually ing ested /number of capsules that should have been ingested per dose 
level) x 100= % compliance
Paclitaxel compliance will be calculated using the following eq uation:
(Number of infusions performed /num ber of infusions that should ha ve been performed per dose level) 
x 100= % compliance
7.4 Blinding
This is an open label study.  Neither the patient nor the inves tigator and site staff will be blinded to the 
treatment administered.
7.5 Prior Treatment
Reasonable efforts will be made to determine all relevant prior  treatments received by the patient within 
four weeks of the first BBI608 dose.  All relevant information must be recorded on the appropriate 
patient's case report form (CRF).  All surgical procedure histo ry, prior chemotherapy and radiation 
therapy must be recorded  on the appropriate CRF.

intermittently in an antiemetic regimen or when prescribed at a  non-immunosuppressive dose 
for treatment of fatigue and l ow-appetite, or as a premedicatio n for paclitaxel infusion)
7.6.3 Drug-Drug Interactions
No clinically apparent drug-drug interactions have been identif ied in patients administered BBI608,
although a dedicated drug interaction study is currently ongoing in healthy human volunteers.
Napabucasin is primarily metabo lized by the CYP P450 isoform 1A 2.  Therefore, caution should be 
exercised with drugs that are strong inhibitors or sensitive su bstrates of CYP1A2. 
Examples of strong 1A2 inhibitors and sensitive inducers are pr esented below:
xStrong CYP 1A2 inhibitors: fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin , zafirlukast
xSensitive CYP1A2 substrates: alo setron, caffeine, duloxetine, m elatonin, ramelteon, 
tasimelteon, theophylline, tizanidine 
Possible actions for investigators with patients taking medicat ions as above include: discontinuing the 
medication entirely, continuing t he medication and monitoring f or adverse effects, and continuing the 
medication at a reduced dose and monitoring for adverse effects .

Confidential Page: 318 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
8.1 Adverse Events 8.1.1 Assessments
The Investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of pa tients who have enrolled in the study.  All 
AEs considered to be related to BBI608 occurring after any admi nistration of the study drug will be 
followed until the event resolves.  AEs will be evaluated using  the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
CTCAE, Version 4.0, published 28 May 2009.
Investigators are required to document all AEs occurring during  the clinical trial, commencing with the 
first dose of BBI608 and including the protocol-defined post-tr eatment follow-up period (21 Code of 
Federal Regulations [CFR] §312.64 [b]) on designated CRF pages.  AEs occurring following the 
signature of the informed consent, but prior to the first dose of study drug will not be reported as AEs.  
It is also important to record all AEs that result in permanent  discontinuation of the investigational 
product being studied, whether serious or non-serious.
Serious adverse events (SAEs), a s defined below, must be report ed to Boston Biomedical Inc. or its 
representative within 24 hours of knowledge of their occurrence .
8.1.2 Definitions
An AE is defined as any untoward  medical occurrence in a patien t or clinical investigational patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship with 
the treatment.  An AE can there fore be any unfavorable and unin tended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example),  symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considere d related to the medicinal pro duct.
Laboratory data are to be collected as stipulated in this proto col, and toxicity trends will be analyzed 
utilizing objective toxicity criteria.  Clinical syndromes asso ciated with laboratory abnormalities are to 
be recorded as appropriate (e.g. , diabetes mellitus instead of hyperglycemia).  
Progression of disease is conside red an efficacy outcome parame ter and should not be captured as an 
AE.  A non-serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that d oes not meet any of the criteria for 
SAEs as defined below.
Patients should be instructed to  report any AE that they experi ence to the investigator.  Investigators 
should assess the patient for AEs at each visit.  AEs occurring  during the clinical trial and the follow-
up period should be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF.  To cap ture the most potentially relevant 
safety information during a clinical trial, it is important tha t investigators record accurate AE terms on 
CRFs.
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by the investigator and recorded on the CRF.  However, if an observed 
or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the 
investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the CRF.

Confidential Page: 328.2 Serious Adverse Events
8.2.1 Definitions 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is  any adverse experience occurri ng at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes:
xDeath
xA life-threatening adverse drug experience
xInpatient hospitalization or pro longation of existing hospitali zation, except for events that are 
clearly disease related 
xA persistent or significant disability/incapacity
xA congenital anomaly/birth defect
Important medical events may be  considered an SAE based upon ap propriate medical judgment.  
Under this protocol, scheduled hospitalizations or elective sur gical procedures will not be considered 
SAEs.  Prolongation of a schedul ed hospitalization can be consi dered an SAE.  Complications 
associated with scheduled pro cedures are considered an AE.
8.2.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE, including death, due to any cause that occurs during t his investigation, whether or not related 
to the administration of study dr ug, must be reported to the Sp onsor immediately (not to exceed 24 
hours) by telephone or facsimile.  The reaction must be complet ely described on the CRF and SAE 
report form.

Confidential Page: 339 ASSESSMENT OF ANTI-TUMOR ACTIVITY IN SOLID TUMORS
The following definitions and cr iteria (from Response Evaluatio n Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST 
1.1, Eisenhauer et al. 2009]1) should be used for the baseline evaluations of existing disea se, and for 
the ongoing evaluation of tumor responses.
Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. 
Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimens ion with longest 
diameter t10 mm using conventional techniques or t10 mm with spiral CT scan. Malignant lymph 
nodes must be t15 mm in the shortest diameter.
Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including sma ll lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm with 
conventional techniques, <10 mm with spiral CT scan or t10 mm to <15 mm in short axis), i.e., bone 
lesions, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, cystic lesions and also abdominal masses that are not 
confirmed and followed by imaging techniques.
xAll measurements should be taken  and recorded in metric notatio n, using a ruler or 
calipers.
xThe same method of assessment and  the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during foll ow-up.
xLesions will only be considered m easurable when they are superf icial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesion s, documentation by 
color photography, and a measurement with a ruler to estimate t he size of the lesion, 
is recommended.
9.1 Methods of Measurement
xCT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible me thods to measure 
target lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI should be 
performed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contigu ously.  Spiral CT should 
be performed using a 5 mm con tiguous reconstruction algorithm.
xAll imaging methods should be pe rformed according to institutio nal standards with 
each patient having consistency of methods beginning from basel ine through the 
course of the study.
9.2 Baseline Documentation of “Tar get” and “Non-Target” Lesions
xAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total wi th a maximum of 2 
lesions per organ, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline*.
xTarget lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability  for accurate repeated measureme nts (either by imaging 
techniques or clinical assessments).
xA sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as th e reference by which 
to characterize the objective tumor response. 
xAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as  non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these les ions are not required, 
but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.
*In most circumstances, a radiology report alone is not sufficient for the purposes of documenting 
target lesion measurements at baseline.  The baseline images and images from each subsequent 
time point should be reviewed specifically according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines.

Confidential Page: 349.3 Response Criteria
Evaluation of tar get lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disapp earance of all target lesions
Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis of <10mm
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the  LD of target lesions, 
takin g as reference the baseline sum LD
Progressive Disease (PD): At leas t a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
t a ki ng  a s  re fe r e nc e  t he  s m a l l e s t  s um  L D re c or de d s i nc e  t he  treatment started.  In addition t o the increase of 20%, the sum  
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.   
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
pro
gression
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for  PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest su m 
LD since the treatment started
Evaluation of non-tar get lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-
patholo gical in size (<10mm short axis)
Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of  o n e  o r  m o r e  n o n - t a r g e t  l e s i o n(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existin g non-tar get lesions*
*Confirmation imaging a minimum of 4 weeks later is recommended in the case of equivocal new 
lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions

cohort sizes of three to six patients, if the true underlying r ates of DLT are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, 
there will be 91%, 71%, 49%, 31%, and 17% chances, respectively , of escalating to the next full doses.
Phase II
There is no statistical hypothesis testing in the Phase II part  and the planned sample size of Phase II (20 
– 40 per cohort) is considered to be clinically adequate to asse ss tolerability, safety, and preliminary 
anti-cancer activity of study drugs of interest, and actual sam ple size depends on the actual enrollment 
in each arm.
Sample Size Justification for Thymic Carcinoma Cohort:
A total of 10 (minimum) to 15 (m aximum) patients will be target e d t o t hi s  c o hor t  a nd  a  B a ye s i an 
posterior probability approach will be employed to monitor the enrollment based on the overall 
response rate (ORR) by Week 16. A fter the first 10 patients hav e response evaluation, or withdraw, or 
die by Week 16, the Bayesian posterior probability of the ORR b eing greater than a target value will 
be continuously evaluated. If the  posterior probability is grea ter than 70% or less than 20%, then further 
enrollment may be stopped. Otherwise enrollment will continue un til the enrollment cap of 15 is 
reached. The targeted ORR is set to be 0.45 for the thymic carci noma cohort. The Bayesian approach 
incorporates the historical data into the decision process by e mploying a weakly informative beta prior 
on the ORR by Week 16 where the beta prior is chosen to have the  mean equal to the historically 
observed ORR of 0.22 (Lemma 2011).
10.3 Analysis Populations
All patients receiving at least one dose of BBI608 will be cons idered evaluable for safety analysis.  
Adverse event incidence rates will be described by the frequency  of adverse events, categorized by NCI 
CTCAE.  Listings of laboratory test results collected at baseli ne and during the study will be generated.  
Descriptive statistics summarizin g the changes in those laborat ory tests over time will be presented. 
Patients who have received at least one cycle of study treatmen t and have had at least one disease 
assessment following the initiation of therapy will be consider ed evaluable for response.  The 
anti-tumor activity will be evaluated on an exploratory basis a nd will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics or graphics.
For each tumor type, the following endpoints will be summarized : Objective response rate (ORR), 
defined as the proportion of pati ents with a documented complet e response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) based on RECIST 1.1; Disease Control Rate (DCR), defined a s the proportion of patients with 
documented CR, PR and stable disease (SD) based on RECIST 1.1; progression free survival (PFS),
defined as the time from enrollment until the first objective o bservation of disease progression or death 
from any cause; and overall survival (OS), defined as the time from enrollment until death from any 
cause.

10.5 Statistical Analysis of P harmacokinetic Variables
Timed blood sample collection for BBI608 and paclitaxel pharmacok inetic analysis will be performed 
on Days 16 and 17 of Cycle 1 for patients enrolled at select study  sites in this study. 
Bioanalytical analysis of patient samples will be conducted at a centralized laboratory using GLP-
validated assays.  Plasma concentrations will be summarized by descriptive statistics, including mean, 
standard deviation, coefficient o f variation, minimum, maximum,  and median .
Concentration profiles will be a nalyzed by noncompartmental and /or nonlinear least squares regression 
using WinNonLin.  Pharmacokine tic parameters, including C max, volume of distribution, distribution 
half-life, terminal half-lif e, and AUC will be evaluated. 
10.6 Safety Analysis
Safety will be assessed by physical examination, and laboratory  assessments.  Adverse events will be 
graded according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0.  The incidence of adverse events and DLTs will be 
evaluated for each dose level, and for all patients combined.  Patients will be followed for adverse 
events for at least 30 days after the last dose of BBI608, or u ntil recovered from all related BBI608
adverse events.

Instructions for Coll ecting and Processing Samples
Sampling to define the plasma pharmacokinetics of BBI608 and pa clitaxel will be performed 
for patients enrolled at selected study sites.  Samples are tak en on Day 16 and Day 17 of cycle 
1. The sampling schedule and summ ary of procedures that are to be used to establish times, 
collect samples, and process spec imens for storage prior to ana lysis, to insure the acquisition 
of accurate pharmacokinetic data, are described below.  The sam pling schedule has been 
devised to accommodate treatment on an outpatient basis.  Dosin g of the first dose of drug 
must be started before 10 a.m. on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thur sday to facilitate the 
collection of the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled time s during the re gular operating 
hours of the outpatient clinics.  
Before starting the BBI 608 administration, p lace a large gauge peripheral cathete r (e.g., 1 9 or 20 
gauge angiocath straight set w ith T-connector, or similar IV acc ess device) within a vein in the 
arm of the subject for the collection of pharmacokinetic blood samples.  Patency of the sampling 
catheter should be maintained between blood draws using either a heparin lock (e.g., 10 U/mL 
in normal saline) or a slow drip of Normal Saline for Injection , USP (e.g., 10 mL/hr).  
Extraordinary caution should be taken to prevent hemolysis in t he blood sample.  Blood may 
be obtained directly by venipuncture on days when only a single  pharmacokinetic blood 
specimen is scheduled for coll ection.  When sam pling through th e peripheral catheter, begin to 
clear the catheter approximately 1  min before the specified sam ple time by withdrawing the 
lock solution and approximately 0.5 mL of blood into a syringe.   Remove and properly dispose 
the syringe used to clear the catheter.
A battery-powered digital timer/stopwatch programmed to operate continuously as a 24-hr 
clock will be used to accurately  monitor drug administration an d sample collection times.  The 
same timer must be allowed to r un without interr uption until th e last blood specimen has been 
obtained from the subject during the first cycle of therapy.  T imer readings will be noted at the 
precise time that the administration is started as well as at t he beginning and ending times of 
the blood sample collection inte rvals.  Readings of the digital  timer must be directly recorded 
on a copy of the appropriate Phar macokinetic Dosing and Blood C ollection Time Form.  
Please note that blood and plasma must be protected from direct  exposure to light and all 
sample processing procedures are to be performed in a room with  indirect lighting.  The volume 
of blood collected for each pharm acokinetic sample will be 3 mL .  This volume has shown to 
be adequate for the pharmacokine tic assay.  Samples are to be c ollected in plastic Vacutainer 
plasma collection tubes.  Immedia tely wrap the tube with alumin um foil to protect it from 
exposure to light.  Promptly mix the plasma collection tube by gently inverting 6-times, then 
place it on wet ice, and centrifuge (1,100-1,300 x g, 10 min, 4 °C) within 5-10 min after 
collection.  Separate the plasm a from the blood cells using a p ipette and transfer approximately 
equal volumes into three 2 mL sel f-standing opaque amber polypro pylene microcentrifuge 
cryogenic tubes with external thr eads. Affix a pre-printed label  (protocol number, subject 
initials, subject number, sampl e collection date and time) to t he cryotube, oriented lengthwise 
Boston Biomedical, Inc 10 May 2018
BBI608-201 Clinical Protocol 4 Amendment #4.0
Confidential Page: 47toward the upper part of the tube. Hand-written information on s ample tube labels is absolutely 
prohibited. Completely cover the label with protective cryogenic  freezer tape.  Place the tube 
on crushed dry-ice until stored  in a freezer maintained at d-70°C.  Any deviation from the 
sample collection time needs to b e documented in the study subje cts’ case report forms and in 
their study binder.
The total volume of blood coll ected for pharmacokinetic studies , 100-120 mL, represents < 
5% of the total blood volume for a 60 kg subject, during a 28-d ay treatment cycle.  As 
pharmacokinetic data becomes ava ilable during the course of the  trial, it may be necessary to 
modify the number of samples or the times at which they are col lected to more accurately 
define the plasma concentration-time profile of the drug.  Howe ver, the cumulative volume of 
blood collected for pharmacokine tic sampling will not exceed 24 0 mL, or approximately 5% 
of the total volum e of a 60 kg subject dur ing the first 4 weeks  of study treatment.  
*Computer files for dose administr ation and sample collection t ime forms and specimen tube 
labels will be placed in a subdirectory located on a secure net work server.  All members of the 
clinical, laboratory, and administrative staff involved with ph ase Ib studies will be given read-
only access to this subdirectory.  The files are placed under t he following subdirectories:  
PK_Time_Forms; PK_Tube_Labels.  Files for the PK time forms are  printed directly from the 
file stored on the network server for each subject study.  Sinc e changes may be periodically 
made to these forms, they cannot b e copied onto user personal c omputers and staff members 
are instructed not to make photo copies of blank forms.  The PK_ Tube_Label files are 
templates, and the files are cop ied to user computers and the l imited informati on pertaining to 
each subject studied, typically the subject entry no., is added  by editing the computer file, then 
printed onto adhesive-backed labels.  Hand-written information on sample tube labels is 
absolutely prohibited.  There are separate sets of labels for b lood collection vials and sample 
storage tubes.  Blood collect ion vials are prelabeled.  
Time points will be determined as the difference between the mi dpoint of the blood collection 
interval and starting time of dose administration.  Concentrati on-time profiles of BBI608 and 
paclitaxel will be analyzed by noncompartmental methods and/or nonlinear least squares 
regression using WinNonlin (Scientific Consulting, Inc.).  Phar macokinetic parameters and 
variables will be calculated according to standard equations.

Instructions for Collectin g, Processing and Shipping Samples
Archival tissues:Archival tissue samples should be  collected from all patients e nrolled in the clinical trial if they 
are available. Submission of par affin embedded tissue blocks to Boston Biomedical is 
preferred; however, if tumor blocks are not available, 20 positi vely charged, unstained tissue 
slides at 5 micron thickness should be sent to Boston Biomedica l. Archive tissue labels should 
be coded with the protocol number,  study site number, the patien t’s initials and the patient 
number.  Paraffin embedded tissue blocks or prepared tissue sli des should be shipped by 
courier to Boston Biomedical a t the address listed below.
Fresh Tumor Biopsies:Patients who are identified by the principal investigator as ha ving a lesion, which could be 
biopsied with a minimally invasive technique, will be asked to sign an additional consent.  
Tumor biopsy samples should be collected at baseline and 4 hour s after administration of 
BBI608 on Day 17 of cycle 1.  Tumor biopsies will be collected f or immunohistochemistry-
based analysis of the target and its downstream genes and for t he analysis of the effect of 
BBI608 on cancer stem cells. These samples will be used for res earch purposes only. Tumor 
biopsies for analysis should be collected by core biopsy or min imally invasive procedures.  
Tumor specimen samples should be processed sterilely into three  parts: fixed, frozen, and 
fresh.  
Fixed Tumor Biopsies fo r Immunohistochemistry 
The sample should be processed to yield paraffin embedded tissue s by the hospital pathology 
department using their standard o perating procedures.  The samp les should be labeled and 
coded with the protocol number, study site number, the patient’ s initials, the patient number 
and the sample collection date and time. The paraffin embedded tissue blocks should be 
shipped to Boston Biomedical a t the address listed below.
Fresh and Frozen Tumor Biops y for cancer stem cell assays
Tumor biopsies for the analysis of the effect of BBI608 on canc er stem cells should be collected 
by core biopsy or similar minim ally invasive procedures.  Once the biopsy tissue is obtained, 
half of the biopsy tissue should be immediately a nd sterilely p laced into CSC transport media 
provided by Boston Biomedical, st ored and shipped at 4ºC.  Over night shipment should be 
arranged on the same day as the biopsy is performed.  A label s hould be affixed to all sample 
tubes containing with the protoco l number, study site number, t he patient’s initials, the patient 
number and the sample collection date and time. The other half should be immediately snap-
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then transferred to a polypropyl ene microcentrifuge cryogenic 
tube. The tissue sample should then be stored at -70ºC until being shipped to Boston 
Biomedical on dry ice to t he address listed below.

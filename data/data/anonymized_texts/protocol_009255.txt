Mental health care costs have further increased in the past two years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of clinical depression among US adults has more than tripled since the COVID-19 pandemic began (Czeisler et al., 2020). The U.S. is in the midst of an unprecedented mental health crisis, and the American public requires treatment options that are effective, safe, and efficiently delivered to patients. There was a large, unmet clinical need for treatment of depression before COVID-19, and there will continue to be such a need after the pandemic is brought under control.   There are significant gaps in the delivery of care to patients suffering from depression. In the U.S., the majority of patients with depression who are treated with antidepressant medication receive their prescription not from a board-certified psychiatrist, but from their primary care physician. These clinicians are usually not responsible for making psychiatric diagnoses, and do not formally monitor side effects or evaluate response (Mann, 2011). Cognitive behavioral therapy and other forms of in-person psychotherapy

                                                                                                 Page 17 of 65      are expensive and require a high level of sustained patient engagement in order to be effective. Inadequate access to mental health resources has long been an issue for many segments of the U.S. population. This reality of the U.S. mental healthcare system means that Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES), as a low risk, home-based intervention, provides a potentially clinically important benefit for treating patients with depression.   Beginning approximately twenty years ago, new, effective forms of neuromodulation became available, some of which the FDA has reviewed for clinical use, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). In the case of CES, which was already commercially available with long track records of safety, a number of pilot studies and a substantial amount of anecdotal evidence supported safety and effectiveness. The development of new neuromodulatory treatments greatly increased interest in the clinical potential of all forms of neurostimulation to treat depression. Scientific and clinical interest also re-focused on older methods of therapy, such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which, like CES, delivers alternating current, albeit ECT delivers an exponentially higher dose of electrical stimulation designed to cause a seizure and thus requires anesthesia to administer. The Fisher Wallace Stimulator delivers a low dose of pulsed alternating current which is comfortable and safe to self-administer and is intended to be used by the patient twice a day to treat depression.   In recent years, animal and clinical research on CES for alleviating depression has increased, and it has been found that higher frequencies can overcome the impedance of the human skull (Mindes, 2015). Neurophysiological effects have been studied using concurrent brain magnetic resonance imaging  (Ghobadi-Azbari, 2020) and electroencephalography (EEG) (Merlet, 2013; Miniussi, 2012). Computational modeling (Datta, 2013 a, b; Khadka, 2020) of stimulation effects using models of electrical behavior in tissues of the head, skull and brain provides additional data suggesting that stimulation may have beneficial impact.   CES is a low-cost, non-invasive, wearable form of low intensity neural stimulation that has been used clinically for over 100 years (Mindes, 2015). This body of evidence from use of CES, and comparison with other neuromodulation methods, indicate that CES is a safe form of neural stimulation that causes minimal side effects. This large body of evidence also suggested possible benefits of regular CES for a range of neuropsychiatric indications, including depression.  The Fisher Wallace Stimulator was cleared by the FDA for the treatment of depression, anxiety and insomnia in 1990 and has been on the market for 32 years - under the brand Liss Cranial Stimulator from 1990-2007, and under the brand Fisher Wallace Stimulator from 2007 to the present. Over 100 published scientific articles analyzing the safety and effectiveness of CES are available on PubMed.gov. Uncontrolled and controlled clinical studies as well as many mechanistic studies have been performed in the US, with better quality research being generated over the past decade. These studies investigated and evaluated the effectiveness and safety of CES devices in various patient populations, as well as possible biological mechanisms of action.

This study will leverage the opportunities and efficiencies of the telehealth environment to investigate the benefits of CES for adults with moderate to severe MDD. In doing so, the study will more accurately represent the real-world experience of patients using CES, as CES devices are typically prescribed for home use, and more psychiatric care is being provided via telemedicine.  This prospective, fully remote, randomized, controlled, triple-blind study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FW-200 self-administered Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) in adults with moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).  3  INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  3.1  INTENDED USE  The Fisher Wallace Stimulator FW-200 is a non-invasive medical device intended to treat adult patients with moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The FW-200 is a prescription device for use at home by the patient without a medical professional, though the device may also be used in a professional health care setting or extended care facility.   3.2  POPULATIONS AND INDICATIONS FOR WHICH THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE IS INTENDED    The indicated use is Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation in adults (ages 21-65 years) for 20 minutes twice daily, upon waking for the day and at bedtime, to reduce symptoms of moderate to severe MDD.  3.3  DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  The FW-200 is a fixed output version of the commercially available FW-100 which has variable output. Whereas the commercially available FW-100 is able to deliver output at four different Levels, 1-4, the FW200 only outputs at Level 2.   The FW-200 device consists of the following components (also refer to figures below):  ● CES device controller  ● Electrode receptacle with sponge  ● Electrode lead wires (red and black)  ● Sponges 4-pack  ● Velcro headband  ● Carry case  ● User guide  ● AA batteries

The sponge electrodes, as well as the scalp and hair beneath the electrodes, must be wet for electrode conductivity to occur. New headsets are provided with pre-installed sponges in the white plastic sponge receptacles. The sponges provided are dehydrated and will expand when wet.  After snapping the white sponge receptacles to the wires and inserting the other ends of the wires into the top of the device, patients must saturate the sponges with water. The electrode sponges should be replaced every two weeks, or if they become stained or appear degraded in any way.  The patient places the headband on the head so that it sits above the eyebrows. The wet electrodes, in the receptacles with attached wires, are placed beneath the headband, above the sideburns. The bottom of the electrode should be in line with the top of the ear. The physiological location of electrode placement is the squamous temporal bone above the very posterior part of the zygomatic arch.    Once the wet sponge electrodes are placed securely beneath the headband, with wires connected, the device is turned on by rotating the dial. The dial is rotated counterclockwise to go from the OFF to ON position (there is a click when the dial is rotated to ON). The green ON light should illuminate and the first and second (Level #2) yellow indicator lights should also flashes yellow, indicating Level #2 output. If the green ON light does not illuminate, the user should replace the batteries. If the yellow indicator lights do not illuminate, the user should press the electrodes against his/her head to expel more water, or rewet the sponges or tighten the headband.

Although the dial does show four levels, all settings will administer Level #2 stimulation to the study subject.  Study subjects will use the device twice daily: once for 20 minutes after waking up for the day and once again for 20 minutes before going to bed.  3.3.1 ACCESSORIES  The FW-200 is provided as a complete kit. For any device replacement needs (lead wires, sponge receptacles, sponge pack or headband), a new complete kit will be shipped.   3.3.2 CONDITIONS OF USE  Users will be provided instructions regarding the conditions of this use.  The environment where the system is used should be one that has the following operating conditions:  ● Temperature range: 41 to 95℉ (5 to 40℃)  ● Relative humidity range: 10% to 93%, non-condensing    Do not allow water to enter the device. The Fisher Wallace Stimulator® should not be exposed to environmental conditions where the system may get wet. Operation in close proximity (e.g., within 1m) to a shortwave or microwave therapy equipment may reduce the output performance of the device.  Keep the device out of reach of children. Electronic monitoring equipment such as ECG monitors and ECG alarms may not operate properly when CES stimulation is in use. High frequency surgical equipment may not be used when CES stimulation is in use. This device is not suitable for use with oxygen or in the presence of a flammable anesthetic mixture with air or oxygen, or with nitrous oxide.  3.3.3 CLEANING THE DEVICE  The device and headset require cleaning for reuse. Reference the User Guide for the cleaning instructions. Investigative staff and subjects will be trained on the cleaning process during device handling training.  3.3.4 SIGNAL FORMS  Both the monopolar waveforms in the FW-200 will make use of three frequencies: 1) 15 kHz; 2) 15 Hz; and 3) 500 Hz. The 15 kHz frequency refers to the carrier frequency. The 500Hz frequency controls the on and off times of the carrier. The 15Hz frequency controls the polarity reversal of the combined 15kHz and 500Hz signals. The voltage amplitude of the output signal is the same for both polarities. The combined voltage amplitude will be twice the monopolar form.

This is done with a fixed voltage and a resistive feedback circuit called the Constant Current Controller. Users should be receiving approximately 2 mA peak-to-peak (in the monopolar scheme) and 4 mA peak-to-peak (in the bipolar scheme).  V oltage and current are directly related to each other by the resistance of the load (in this case the human head). Therefore, a constant current controller was needed to address the variability in the resistance of the human head. The constant current controller adjusts its own resistance so that the human head plus the controller will produce a fixed current for the Output voltage. At a resistance of 100 Ohms, the voltage output is approximately 400 mV . At 200 Ohms, the voltage output is double, approximately 800 mV .  The average current output relates to the modulation of the signal. If the voltage was applied constantly, the average current would be 2mA because it is being modulated the average current is reduced by each duty cycle: 50% due to the 15kHz on/off carrier modulation; 50% due to the 500Hz on/off modulation of the carrier and 75% due the off time between the 15Hz polarity reversal.   That provides an average current of 0.375 mA.  3.3.6 ELECTRONICS/CONTROLLER  Figure 9 below is a block diagram of the electronics system. It demonstrates the key connections between the major systems that make up the Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA). The batteries provide power for the entire system operation.  The microcontroller (MCU) takes input from the Dip Switch and a Rotary switch. In turn, it controls the light emitting diodes (LEDs) and the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) Analog Switch. The MCU will also power the LEDs to visually affirm that the device is on. The V oltage Regulator takes power from the Batteries and increases the voltage for the output circuitry. The Microcontroller produces the three frequencies and modulates the Output using the CMOS Analog Switch. The Analog Switch is able to both turn on and off the voltage as well as swap the Output’s polarity. The Constant Current Controller maintains current through the Output by the use of a resistive feedback circuit. This circuit varies its own resistance so that 2mA is maintained even if there are differences at the output.  The Microcontroller will drive the Buzzer to indicate the end of the session.

Passing results were achieved.    4.2  SUMMARY OF CLINICAL STUDIES  To examine the safety and effectiveness of the Fisher Wallace Stimulator, Model FW- 200, for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed in a fully remote fashion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subjects with either mild, moderate, or severe major depressive disorder were enrolled in the study. Throughout the treatment period, participants administered twice daily 20-minute treatments with either the active device or a sham device treatment. Participants were randomized into immediate or delayed treatment arms. In the immediate treatment arm, participants administered active treatment (20 minutes of clinical stimulation per treatment session) for 8 weeks. Participants in the delayed treatment arm received sham stimulation (two seconds of clinical stimulation and 19 minutes and 58 seconds of zero stimulation per treatment session) for 4 weeks, before being unblinded. At that point, participants were crossed over to active treatment for the following 4 weeks.  Participants completed reports of compliance with treatment, as well as assessments of symptoms and side effects throughout the study, particularly at weeks 2, 4, and 8. Physician assessments were performed prerandomization and at 4 weeks.  The primary outcome measure was change in Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) score from baseline to week 4 in immediate versus delayed treatment arms. The BDI-II is a widely used selfreported instrument to assess the severity of depression in adolescents and adults from different cultural groups and populations (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition | The National Child Traumatic Stress

Secondary outcome measures included: change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale from baseline to week 4, change in BDI-II from baseline to week 2, change in BDI-II from week 4 to 8, change in Patient Health Questionnaire-8 from baseline to week 2 and week 4, as well as safety and tolerability as measured by Systematic Assessment for Treatment of Emergent Events (SAFTEE).  This study enrolled 275 participants with 137 participants in the Immediate Treatment arm and 138 participants in the Delayed Treatment arm. Of these, 83 participants in the Immediate Treatment arm and 78 participants receiving delayed treatment completed 4-week assessments.  Table 1 provides the percentages of side effects experienced by subjects in both treatment arms at Week 4. Table 2 displays the percentages of patient-reported side effects at Week 8. There were no reported serious adverse events. Overall, more adverse events were reported in the Delayed Treatment arm than the Immediate Treatment arm. Minor symptoms reported were similar in both groups with 13/34 symptoms on SAFTEE reported more frequently in the Immediate Treatment group and 21/34 symptoms reported more frequently by individuals in the Delayed Treatment arm.

This decrease of greater than ten points is indicative of antidepressant effectiveness.  More than 40% of the patients had a decrease of 50% in BDI-II or more. Due to high levels of placebo response, the between group difference in BDI-II change was -0.8 (p = 0.496). Significantly, and despite the fairly large drop in BDI-II during the first four weeks in the sham arm, the switch to active treatment was associated with additional improvement (BDI-II decrease from week 4 to 8 of 3.6 points) beyond what they had experienced during the first four weeks, while the Immediate Treatment arm only showed minimal additional improvement in this period (BDI-II decrease of 0.6 points, p < 0.01), representing an improvement of more than 15% from BDI-II scores from the end of the sham period. Thus, the data demonstrate the effectiveness of the FW-200 in treating depression.  5  BENEFITS AND RISKS OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE, CLINICAL PROCEDURE AND CLINICAL INVESTIGATION  5.1  ANTICIPATED CLINICAL BENEFIT  Participation in this study may treat moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder in adults (ages 21-65).  Knowledge gained from this study may enable future patients to benefit from CES.  5.2  POTENTIAL ANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS  Potential anticipated adverse events are those that may occur in association with a CES treatment, including those AEs listed below that are known risks from clinical experience/use of the FW-200 and similar CES devices (Federal Register :: Neurological Devices; Reclassification of Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulator Devices Intended To Treat Anxiety and/or Insomnia; Effective Date of Requirement for Premarket Approval for Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulator Devices Intended To Treat Depression, n.d.).   Risks associated with CES and CES devices include:  ● Skin irritation  ● Headaches  ● Dizziness  ● Electrical shocks and burns  The FW-200 is contraindicated for patients with the following:   ● Demand or sensing type pacemakers, or any other form of implanted electronics  ● Known heart disease  ● A poor reaction to the idea of electrical stimulation of any kind  ● Skin irritation around either electrode site  ● The device should not be used around the Carotid sinus

                                                                                                 Page 34 of 65      As stated in the CES-MDD User Guide section, the FW-200 should not be used on the throat, neck or eyes. Subjects should avoid using the device near areas of the body where there is embedded shrapnel or metal plates. There is no danger to subjects using the device who have had dental fillings.   Subjects may experience skin irritation at the site of sponge electrode placement, especially if the sponges deteriorate or if contact is made between the skin and the metal part of the sponge receptacle, or if the sponges are not thoroughly wet before each use. Please refer to the CES-MDD User Guide for more information.   5.3  STEPS TO CONTROL OR MITIGATE THE RISKS  A Risk Management Program has been established by Fisher Wallace Laboratories. Risks associated with the FW-200 have been minimized by the design, labeling, and or training. An experienced investigator and site staff as well as licensed psychiatric care providers have been chosen to conduct this study.  They have been trained on the study protocol as well as the investigational device.  They are familiar with the disease state, moderate to severe MDD, and have appropriate experience to evaluate and navigate changing care needs for the subjects, if applicable.  Adverse events will also be monitored throughout the study by the Principal Investigator and/or designee using the ePRO.     5.4  RESIDUAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  Residual risk is defined as the risk remaining after protective measures have been taken. The residual risk was reviewed by the Sponsor and deemed acceptable or acceptable with continuous monitoring.   5.5  OTHER COMPLICATIONS AND RISKS IN CLINICAL USE  There are no additional risks or complications known during clinical use beyond those already listed in this protocol.    5.6  RISK-TO-BENEFIT RATIONALE  It is expected that subjects enrolled in this study will not be exposed to risks beyond those normally associated with CES devices. CES devices have been extensively studied and the risks have been shown to be low. There was a low rate of adverse events in prior research with the FW-200.  The FW-200 may reduce the risk of moderate to severe MDD in adults. A prior study of the FW-200 in adults with mild, moderate, and severe MDD demonstrated very low risk of the device itself, in addition to a trend towards improvement in MDD symptoms by week 2 of device usage.    Based upon review of the risk measures taken with the device and the results of prior studies with the FW200, as well as the risk mitigation measures in the protocol, and consideration of the potential benefits to study subjects or future patients, the risk/benefit profile for the FW-200 is considered acceptable and justifies conducting this study.

A two-week time point for the primary endpoint offers the ability to detect an acute change in patient status with use of the FW-200, which may be an advantage over other therapies. For example, pharmacological treatment can require titration to a full therapeutic dose, which may depend on individual patient characteristics, including the patient’s age, treatment setting, comorbidities, concomitant pharmacotherapy, or specific medication side effects, all which may lead to a lengthy titration process. Psychotherapy approaches require a similar tailored approach. Guidelines note that for both pharmacological and psychotherapy approaches may require 4 to 8 weeks of treatment (Gelenberg, 2010).  Secondary endpoints include: Change in BDI-II scores at one and four weeks compared to baseline, change in PHQ-9 and QIDS-SR scores at one week, two weeks, and four weeks compared to baseline, and BDI-II responder rate (i.e., % of subjects with a 50% or better improvement in score from baseline) at four weeks. The PHQ-9 is a validated tool for assessing depression severity and response to treatment (Nida, n.d.) The QIDS-SR has been demonstrated to be a valid measure of depression symptom severity in both research and clinical settings (Rush et al., 2003). The secondary endpoints of BDI-II at one and four weeks plus the BDIII responder rate at four weeks aim to provide additional evidence of effectiveness over additional time points.   Safety of the FW-200 will be assessed with standard adverse event data collection over the course of the study, comparing sham-assigned subject data to active treatment subject data. Adverse events for both sham and active device subjects will be MedDRA coded and analyzed for trends.  During this trial, the subject, Principal Investigator, and Sponsor will be blind to the study treatment assignment. The James Blinding Index will be used to assess blinding after the subject completes training on device usage.    Only subjects with moderate to severe MDD will be enrolled in the trial.  This triple blind, sham controlled study intends to collect data to demonstrate that the FW-200 device delivers CES that improves symptoms of moderate to severe MDD in adults.   6.2  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  To demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of FW-200 CES self-administered for the treatment of moderate to severe MDD in adults.    6.2.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT  This study’s primary endpoint is the change in BDI-II score at two weeks compared to baseline.

Pre-screening questions will include inclusion/exclusion criteria, demographics, medical history, and concomitant medications. Candidate subjects will also take the BDI-II and PHQ-9 assessments. Select questions from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) will also be required. The ePRO will be programmed to determine if the candidate’s answers meet eligibility criteria for the study. If not, the candidate will be notified via email or SMS text that they are not suitable for study participation. If the candidate meets pre-screening eligibility, the ePRO will notify the candidate via email or SMS text that a member of the investigational staff will be in contact to further discuss study requirements and eligibility.  Investigative staff will speak with pre-screened potential subjects by telephone to describe study expectations and perform the informed consent process. Investigative staff will also ask the candidate to confirm that data provided during the pre-screening process is accurate and is allowed to be used for study evaluation purposes. If the candidate subject does not consent to study participation or the use of their prescreening data, the candidate will be deemed a pre-screen failure. If the candidate subject signs the

From the point of enrollment, subjects in screening will begin a 14-day minimum lead-in period. At the conclusion of the lead-in period, screened subjects will retake the BDI-II and PHQ-9 assessments, and additionally take the QIDS-SR assessment to establish baseline data. A BDI-II score between 20 and 63, inclusive, will serve to indicate that a subject’s moderate to severe MDD has been stable during the lead-in period.  If the BDI-II score is not within the range, the subject’s MDD will be considered insufficiently stable for study entry. The subject will be notified that they are no longer eligible for study participation and they will be considered a screen failure.  If the screened subject’s data is within the acceptable range for the BDI-II, the subject will advance to scheduling a meeting with a clinician from the investigative team. Via teleconference, the clinician will administer the M.I.N.I. assessment and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) evaluation.   If the clinician identifies that the subject’s results do not meet both M.I.N.I. and DSM-5 criteria for moderate to severe MDD, the subject will be notified that they are no longer eligible for study participation. Additionally, during the live interview, the clinician may deem the subject a screen failure should they no longer meet all inclusion criteria or meet any exclusion criteria.   If the clinician diagnoses the subject with moderate to severe MDD based on the results of the M.I.N.I. and DSM-5 assessments, and determines that the subject meets all other eligibility criteria, the subject will be prescribed study treatment by the clinician and be randomized to a study treatment arm (sham device or active treatment device). Only eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study, randomized to a treatment arm, and receive an investigational device shipped directly to them by an unblinded Sponsor designee.    Prior to starting self-administered therapy with the FW-200 sham or active device, subjects will review an online device training video and undergo a live device and ePRO training with investigative staff. The day after successfully completing live training with investigative staff, subjects will begin self-administered therapy twice per day, one 20-minute session after waking for the day and one 20-minute session before going to bed. Each day of study therapy, subjects will confirm in ePRO that they completed both treatment sessions for the day. Subjects will also be asked if there have been any changes to their medications or health status within the past 24 hours. This will be captured as free text to allow subjects to describe any positive or negative (adverse events) experiences during study therapy.  At the following time points, subjects will retake the BDI-II, PHQ-9, and QIDS-SR assessments:   ● Week 1 (Day 7 of therapy)  ● Week 2 (Day 14 of therapy)  ● Week 4 (Day 28 of therapy)   For the Week 1 and Week 2 evaluations, subjects will have 2 additional days to complete the assessments. For the Week 4 evaluation, subjects will have 5 additional days to complete the assessments. Should a

Subjects will not be withdrawn from the study for minor protocol deviations.   Subject participation in the study concludes after completion of the Week 4 evaluation. At that time, subjects will be contacted to return the investigational device and log in ePRO any adverse experiences or medication changes within the past 24 hours.     7.1.2 Measures to Minimize or Avoid Bias  The Principal Investigator is an expert user of the study device and will serve as a trainer on device handling for investigative staff. All investigative staff will be trained on the use of the device, this protocol, use of the  ePRO, and Good Clinical Practices (GCP).  Additional training may be provided to the Principal Investigator or investigative staff by Climb, NAMSA, or the Sponsor as needed.   This study is prospective, randomized, sham controlled study, triple blinded for the subject, Principal Investigator, and Sponsor. Randomization provides a level of protection against bias as it tends to balance all confounders, both measured and unmeasured. Pre-specified endpoints and analysis plans, with a statistically powered sample size further minimize the potential for bias. The planned two-week lead-in period to establish a stable baseline should minimize bias due to regression to the mean.   7.2  SUBJECTS  7.2.1 Inclusion Criteria for Subject Selection  Subjects will need to meet all the following inclusion criteria:    1.

The website will provide potential subjects with information regarding the study and expectations.  They will also be presented with an information privacy policy which they must confirm they agree with prior to submitting responses for investigative staff review.      Interested participants will complete the following pre-screening assessments in ePRO:   ● Eligibility questions pertaining to Inclusion/Exclusion criteria (includes medical history and concomitant medications)  ● Demographics  ● BDI-II  ● PHQ-9  ● Questions from M.I.N.I.  The website will inform the potential subject if they are a potential candidate for the study based on their initial answers.   7.3.2.1 Demographics  The candidate subject will provide the following demographic information: self-identified gender, biological sex, age, race, and ethnicity.   7.3.2.2 BDI-II  To assess severity of depression, the potential subject will answer this 21-question multiple-choice selfreport inventory. The candidate subject’s BDI-II score must be within the range of 20-63 indicating moderate to severe MDD.    7.3.2.3 PHQ-9  The candidate subject will answer this questionnaire, a 9-item scale covering the DSM criteria for major depressive disorder, with a diagnostic algorithm and score based assessment of presence and severity of depression.  7.3.2.4 Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.)  The candidate subject will self-report their answers to select questions from the M.I.N.I using ePRO.  The M.I.N.I. is an assessment tool for the major psychiatric disorders in DSM-5 (Sheehan et al., 2010).  If any answers indicate that the subject may be experiencing a condition that meets any exclusion criteria, the candidate will not advance further in the pre-screening process.

During this meeting, the investigative staff will review the purpose of the study, the daily requirements of study participation, answer any preliminary questions from the candidate, and confirm that the data provided during pre-screening is still accurate. Should the subject indicate that data reported during pre-screening requires revision/correction, the investigative staff will review the change(s) and determine if the candidate is still potentially eligible for study entry. If not, the investigative staff will inform the candidate that they are no longer able to be considered for the study. If the change does not cause the candidate to fail pre-screening, the investigative staff will make the change in ePRO and enter a reason for change in ePRO as well. The ePRO includes an audit history to display changes to reported data, the author of the change, and the date/time when the change was saved.   If the candidate agrees to learn more about the study, the study staff member will perform the informed consent process. Investigative staff will also ask the candidate to confirm that the data collected during the pre-screening process can be used for study screening and evaluation purposes. If the candidate subject does not consent to study participation or to the use of their pre-screening data, the candidate will be deemed a pre-screen failure. All pre-screening data for that candidate will not be saved in ePRO for the study. If the candidate subject signs the informed consent form and allows the use of their pre-screening data for the study, the candidate will advance to study enrollment.   7.3.3.1 Informed Consent  The investigative team will introduce the potential participant to the clinical investigation by explaining the protocol including the study objectives, procedures, and participation requirements.   If the potential participant is interested in participating, the study staff will review the informed consent form. This will include describing the clinical investigation, potential discomforts, risks, and benefits of participation. The potential subject will have sufficient time to decide whether they wish to participate in this clinical investigation.   Any queries that the potential participant may have regarding this clinical investigation will be addressed appropriately by the investigative team.  Potential subjects will be instructed that they are free to obtain further information from the Principal Investigator and investigative team at any time and that they are free to withdraw their consent and to discontinue their participation in the clinical investigation at any time without prejudice.  If the potential participant is willing to participate in the clinical investigation, he/she must read, understand and sign the informed consent form. The informed consent form will be sent to the potential subject electronically via a validated signature program such as DocuSign. The potential subject will be asked to complete the electronic signature of the form. The Principal Investigator or designee who conducted the informed consent discussion will also sign. A copy of the signed consent will be provided to the subject electronically.

No data will be collected from the subject during this time; however, the data collected during pre-screening will be saved in ePRO as study eligibility data.  After 14 days of lead-in time, subjects will be prompted to retake the BDI-II and PHQ-9 assessments in ePRO. Subjects will also take a QIDS-SR assessment in ePRO. A subject must have a BDI-II score between 20 and 63, indicating moderate to severe MDD, at both initial pre-screening and baseline to participate in the study.   If the BDI-II assessment score is not within the moderate to severe MDD range, the subject’s health will be considered insufficiently stable for study entry. The subject will be notified that they are no longer eligible for study participation and they will be considered a screen failure.  If the screened subject’s data is within the moderate to severe MDD range for the BDI-II assessment, the subject will advance to scheduling a meeting with a clinician from the investigative team.  7.3.5 Clinical Interview and Eligibility Reevaluation  Subjects with baseline BDI-II scores within the range of moderate to severe MDD will be contacted to schedule a meeting with a clinician from the investigative staff.  During this teleconference or video conference with the subject, the clinician will conduct the M.I.N.I. and DSM-5 assessments to evaluate the subject for moderate to severe MDD. If the clinician determines that the subject cannot be diagnosed with moderate to severe MDD, the subject will be deemed a screen failure and discontinued from study participation. Subjects who have or appear to have any of the following diagnoses or conditions will also be excluded from further study participation and documented as a screen failure:   ● Bipolar I disorder  ● Bipolar II disorder  ● Other specified bipolar and related disorder  ● Panic disorder  ● Agoraphobia  ● Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)  ● Obsessive-compulsive disorder  ● Posttraumatic stress disorder  ● Alcohol use disorder in the past 12 months  ● Substance use disorder (non-alcohol) in the past 12 months  ● Any psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder)  ● Major depressive disorder with psychotic features  ● Anorexia nervosa

After confirming a diagnosis of moderate to severe MDD for the subject, the clinician will review the subject’s reported information in ePRO to ensure the subject continues to meet study eligibility criteria. Any subject who fails to fulfill any element of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be considered a screen failure.  Subjects who meet all study eligibility criteria and receive a diagnosis of moderate to severe MDD from the clinician will advance to receiving a prescription for an investigational device to be used during the study.   7.3.6 Subject Identification and Randomization   Once eligibility is confirmed by the clinician and a prescription is written for the investigational device, the subject will be assigned a unique identification (ID) number by Climb. The subject ID number will consist of 01 for the first subject, 02 for the second subject, and so on.  This number will be used to identify the subject during their participation in the study. Climb will maintain a log of all subjects enrolled in the clinical study including their names, their study ID number, and contact information.   The subject will also be randomized (approximately 1:1) to either the treatment group (active device) or the control (sham device).  Climb will create and maintain the randomization table and assign subjects to each group. The randomization data will be restricted to unblinded investigative staff members only until the conclusion of the study. The unblinded team will be responsible for maintaining the randomization table.  7.3.6.1 Device Shipment  An unblinded investigative staff member who is not associated with any other function of the study will receive the subject’s randomization allocation and contact/shipping address information. The study device type, either sham or active treatment, assigned to the subject through the randomization process will be directly shipped to the location requested by the subject by a third party vendor in collaboration with the unblinded investigative staff member.   7.3.7 Subject Training  The subject will be advised to not use the investigational device until after receiving live training. Prior to the live training, the subject will be asked to complete online device training using pre-recorded videos.   Once the subject receives the investigational device, they must participate in a live training with investigative staff to further learn how to correctly place and use the device, clean the device components that will be reused, and complete data collection in ePRO. The trainer will explain that the device is locked

The subject will confirm in ePRO that their training was completed. The trainer will also record in ePRO that training was completed. The subject will continue to have access to the pre-recorded instructional video and usage manual during the study as needed for additional reference and may contact the investigative staff for device handling support during the study.   7.3.7.1 James Blinding Index  After participating in the live device training session with investigative staff, the subject will be asked in ePRO which type of investigational device they believe they received (active device or control). The subject will select from 5 options to indicate if they strongly believe they have an active device, somewhat believe they have an active device, do not know, somewhat believe they have a sham device, or strongly believe they have a sham device. The subject’s response will be analyzed using the James Blinding Index.   7.3.8 Period 1: Week 1 Device Usage  Subjects will begin using the investigational device the day after the live training session with investigative staff. Subject will use the device as instructed, for 20 minutes after waking for the day and for 20 minutes prior to going to bed. Each day of study therapy, subjects will report in ePRO whether or not they used the study device as instructed and if there had been a change to their health status or medications over the previous 24 hours.     7.3.9 Period 1: Week 1 Evaluation  After completion of at least 1 week (7 days plus up to 2 additional days) of device usage, subjects will be requested to complete the following in ePRO:  ● BDI-II  ● PHQ-9  ● QIDS-SR  ● Any Adverse Events  ● Any changes to their reported concomitant medications  7.3.10 Period 2: Week 2 Device Usage  Subjects will continue daily use of the device and report in ePRO whether or not they used the study device as instructed and if there had been a change to their health status or medications over the previous 24 hours.   7.3.11 Period 2: Week 2 Evaluation   After completing Week 2 (7 days plus up to 2 additional days) of device usage, subjects will be requested to complete the following in ePRO:

Investigative staff will document in ePRO the date and reason(s) for subject withdrawal. All subjects who discontinue treatment for any reason shall be contacted by investigative staff in an effort to follow the subject for safety.  Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the study personnel or institution. If a subject decides to withdraw, all study evaluations and procedures will be stopped, and an inquiry will be made about the cause of withdrawal. Climb will account for and document all subjects enrolled in the study, including those withdrawn from the study or lost to follow-up. If a subject withdraws from the clinical investigation, the reason(s) shall be reported in ePRO.  Reasons for withdrawal include, but are not limited to:  ● Subject’s rescission of consent.   ● Any unexpected adverse device effect which is, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, related to the device and will endanger the wellbeing of the subject if the treatment is continued.  ● The development of any undercurrent illness(es), infection or condition(s) that might interfere with the Clinical Investigation Plan.  ● Any problem deemed by the Principal Investigator and Sponsor to be sufficient to cause discontinuation.   ● Lost to follow-up  ● Death  Additional study data may no longer be collected after the point at which a subject has been withdrawn from the study or withdraws his/her consent. Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal will be used for analysis.  Subjects who are withdrawn will not be replaced if they have received the investigational device. If possible, any assessments planned for the subject on withdrawal from the clinical investigation, including adverse event collection, should be performed when intention to withdraw the subject is announced.  Subjects who are withdrawn prior to receiving an investigational device will be replaced, including screen failures.  7.3.15.2 SUBJECT REPLACEMENT  Subjects may be replaced if they are screen failures.

All contact efforts to obtain follow-up information should be documented in ePRO.   7.4  MONITORING  All source data and documentation will be reviewed for completeness and appropriateness by investigative staff.    The Principal Investigator and Climb will permit the Sponsor (or designee) and the FDA to inspect source documentation and data for this study. These inspections are for the purpose of verifying adherence to the protocol and the completeness and accuracy of the data recorded in ePRO.   7.4.1 Source Data and Documentation  For this patient-reported decentralized clinical trial, source data is defined as all information in original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical investigation, necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the clinical investigation. Data entered into ePRO by subjects and/or investigative staff will be considered one form of source data for this study.  Source documents are defined as printed, optical, or electronic documents containing source data, e.g., prescriptions for the device, device accountability records, and any medical records kept by the investigative staff in support of this clinical investigation.   7.4.2 Audits and Inspections  The FDA and the Notified Body have the right to conduct an audit of the clinical investigation to ensure that the clinical investigations was, in fact, performed by the investigative staff and that the data reported in support of a marketing application accurately reflects the data in the records. The authority may also inspect such studies to verify that the clinical investigation was conducted in accordance with national regulations relating to the IRB and informed consent.  It is the joint responsibility of the Sponsor and the Principal Investigator to ensure that the clinical investigation has been conducted in line with all national and local regulations.  In the event that the FDA or Notified Body desires to inspect this clinical investigation, the Sponsor, Principal Investigator, Climb, and NAMSA will permit authorized inspectors to inspect all facilities and records relating to the clinical investigation and aid the Inspector to perform the audit in a timely fashion.

                                                                                                 Page 53 of 65      details regarding plans for analysis populations, subgroups, secondary endpoints, handling missing data, and sensitivity analyses will be provided in a separate standalone Statistical Analysis Plan.  8.1  ANALYSIS POPULATION  The primary analysis will be based on intent-to-treat, with subjects analyzed as randomized regardless of treatment actually received.    8.2  DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  Continuous data will be summarized with mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and number of evaluable observations. Categorical variables will be summarized with frequency counts and percentages. Confidence intervals may be presented, where appropriate, using the t-distribution for continuous data and Clopper-Pearson Exact method for categorical variables.  8.3  ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES  The primary endpoint is the change in BDI-II at week 2 compared to baseline. Analysis will be based on a linear model for change, adjusted for each subject’s baseline value. The mathematical statement of the null and alternative hypothesis for primary endpoint is:  Ho: B2 ≤ 0   Ha: B2 > 0 where B2 represents the regression coefficient from the linear model corresponding to study arm, parameterized so a regression coefficient greater than zero represents a greater mean change for the treatment group compared to the control group. The general form of the linear model for each endpoint is:  ΔY = B0 + B1Y0 B2*X  where ΔY is the change in outcome from baseline at week 2, B0 is the intercept term, B1 is the coefficient for the subject’s baseline value Y0, and X is the treatment group indicator (1 = treatment, 0 = sham). Multiple imputation will be employed to address missing data.   Study success will be based on successful rejection of the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint.  Subgroup analysis will be provided based on sex and race as well as potentially other baseline factors, including baseline BDI-II score.   8.4  SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL AND POWER OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AND OVERALL STATISTICAL TESTING STRATEGY  The primary endpoint analysis will be performed at the one-sided 0.025 alpha level. Any other p-values and confidence intervals will be based on a nominal two-sided 0.05 alpha level (or equivalently a one-sided 0.025 alpha level as appropriate) without adjustment for multiple comparisons.

                                                                                                 Page 54 of 65      8.5  SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION AND JUSTIFICATION  A total of 250 evaluable subjects (in a 1:1 allocation ratio) will provide 80% power assuming a population mean difference between groups of 3.2 and a common standard deviation of 9 based on a two-sided twosample t-test with an alpha of 0.05. Previous data suggests the standard deviation for 2 week improvement to be approximately 6.5; however, a conservative estimate of 9 was used for these calculations. If the observed standard deviation is less than 9, a smaller effect size will provide 80% power. In addition, this calculation is conservative since the planned test adjusting for baseline is expected to provide additional power. Sample size calculations were performed using PASS 2021 (NCSS, LLC).  While some amount of missing data is expected, the primary analysis will be based on the randomized cohort of subjects and will employ multiple imputation to mitigate the impact of missing data.   The sample size for the study is practically constrained by regulatory requirements for timely submission and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, while the final formal analysis is planned for the final planned sample size, circumstances may dictate initial regulatory submission based on data available with supplemental updates provided later based on the final data set. Since the formal analysis will be based on the final planned sample size, there are no alpha implications.   9  DATA MANAGEMENT  9.1  PROCEDURES FOR DATA MANAGEMENT  Climb will be responsible for study data management according to a project plan developed for this study in collaboration with the Sponsor and designee(s).    The details of data review and querying will be described in a Data Management Plan (DMP) that will be maintained by Climb, the Principal Investigator, and the Sponsor. This plan may be updated throughout the investigation as amended data management requirements and investigation-specific data conventions are determined.  9.1.1 Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes  The Climb web-based ePRO digital health technology will be used to record and manage study data. Subjects who have been screened for study participation and signed an Informed Consent Form will selfreport their experiences during the trial using the ePRO. Subject training on ePRO usage will be conducted prior to starting study treatment with the investigational device. Investigative staff will be available to answer questions from subjects about ePRO usage and assist them with technological issues or clarifications.   Investigative staff will review all subject-entered ePRO data to monitor subject safety and identify any issues pertaining to study design or the investigational product. A subject may contact the investigative team should they wish for their reported data to be reised or corrected. An investigative team member will make the change in ePRO and enter a reason for change in ePRO as well. The ePRO includes an audit history to display changes to reported data.

All changes to ePRO data will be captured in an audit trail.  9.1.3 Confidentiality    This clinical investigation will comply with HIPAA and any additional requirements imposed by national law concerning data protection.  A study code identification number will be used to facilitate creation of de-identified reports. Subject personal data will be processed at all times in accordance with applicable legal requirements and will be used solely for the purposes of conducting this clinical study and to aid future scientific research in the treatment of moderate to severe depressive disorder. In general, only the Sponsor or authorized designees will have direct access to subject personal data. It may also happen that representatives of national or international public health authorities (e.g., Competent Authorities) are granted direct access to subject personal data, if required by applicable law.  9.2  PROCEDURES FOR VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF EPRO SYSTEM  The ePRO used for this trial was verified and validated by Climb’s procedures for data capture validation and verification.   9.3  PROCEDURES FOR DATA RETENTION   The Climb procedures for study data retention will be followed. All information in the ePRO will be stored in a secure validated database.  9.4  SPECIFIED RETENTION PERIOD    The Sponsor shall maintain the records of the study during this investigation and for a period of 2 years after the later of the following two dates: The date on which the investigation is terminated or completed, or the date that the records are no longer required for purposes of supporting a premarket approval application, a notice of completion of a product development protocol, a humanitarian device exemption application, or a premarket notification submission.  9.5  CLINICAL QUALITY ASSURANCE    The study will be conducted and monitored by the Sponsor and authorized designees. The Sponsor may appoint a Quality Assurance (QA) auditor to review the records and conduct of the study.  10 AMENDMENTS TO THE PROTOCOL  Any modifications to the protocol require Sponsor approval.  Once completed, the revised protocol needs to be submitted to the IRB. The protocol must receive written approval as an Amendment prior to implementing the modifications.

However, the influence of other factors such as underlying disease, concomitant medications, or concurrent treatment may have contributed to the event.  ● Probable: The temporal sequence between the device use and the event is such that the relationship is likely or subject’s condition or concomitant therapy could have caused the AE.  ● Definite: The AE occurs in a plausible time relationship to study device usage and cannot be explained by any concurrent disease or other devices, drugs or chemicals.  Additionally, the investigator will record in ePRO if the AE meets the definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) as per the definition in Section 15.1.    15.2.2 Sponsor Responsibilities    All adverse events and device deficiencies will be reviewed by the Sponsor to assess regulatory reporting responsibilities for the event. The Sponsor will maintain records concerning adverse device effects, whether anticipated or unanticipated.  The Sponsor will immediately conduct an evaluation of any unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs). If it is determined that a UADE presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the Sponsor will terminate the study or the parts of the study presenting that risk as soon as possible. The results of a UADE investigation will be reported to FDA and to the IRB within 10 working days after the Sponsor first receives notice of the effect. Thereafter, the Sponsor will submit such additional reports concerning the effect as requested by FDA.

Anticipated potential AEs that may be encountered in the conduct of this study including potential AEs related to the use of the FW-200 are listed in Section 5.2 Potential Anticipated Adverse Events. It is possible that there are additional risks that have not been foreseen.  15.4 EMERGENCY CONTACT DETAILS    In case of an immediately reportable adverse event (UADE), contact the Sponsor:   Gordon Levites, Quality Assurance Manager  1-631-813-8612 gordon@fisherwallace.com   16 VULNERABLE POPULATIONS  ISO 14155:2020 defines a vulnerable subject as an individual whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation or of retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. Individuals who suffer from Major Depressive Disorder would be considered a vulnerable population and therefore included within this clinical investigation.    These vulnerable subjects according to the ISO 14155 definition will be asked to provide their informed consent if they are capable of providing it themselves and the consent process will be performed without undue delay. Informed consent processes shall be conducted according to national law and IRB procedures.  The protection of the rights and welfare of study participants will be overseen by the responsible IRB and the Principal Investigator.  17 SUSPENSION OR PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION  17.1 CRITERIA FOR SUSPENSION OR PREMATURE TERMINATION  The clinical study may be stopped at any time at the Sponsor’s discretion.  In addition, further recruitment in the study may be stopped due to insufficient compliance with the protocol, GCP-related issues, and/or other applicable  regulatory requirements, procedure-related problems, lack of enrollment, or if the number of subject discontinuations for administrative reasons is deemed too high.

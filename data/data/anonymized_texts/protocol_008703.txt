Statistical plan for  
Historically Controlled Trial of Corticosteroids in Young Boys With 
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  
 
 
Statistics will be performed with Excel (Microsoft Inc.) and GraphPad 
Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). P -values will all 2-tailed.  A p 
value of <0.05 will interpreted as showing statistical significance. Mann 
Whitney U will be  used for non -parametric data.   
Analysis of data will be performed in two ways.  First, the change 
over one year in the Treated Cohort will be compar ed to the previously 
published Historical Control Cohort (HCC).  Second, repeated measures 
(paired t - tests) were used to analyze each boy’s performance over his own 
baseline.

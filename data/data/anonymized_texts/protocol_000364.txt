groups using Cox proportional hazards model with the 
stratification factors included in the model. The hazard 
ratio for treatment effect and its 95% CI will be estimated.  
The validity of the proportional hazards assumption will 
first be checked by defining a time dependent covariate 
and employing it in the model. If the assumption of 
proportional hazards holds then the estimate for the time -
dependent covariate will not differ significan tly from 
zero.  
If the proportional hazards assumption is violated, then 
the adjusted hazard ratio arising from inclusion of the 
time-dependent covariate will be reported.  
The Score likelihood test (i.e., which is equivalent to log-
rank test) from the Cox proportional hazards model will 
be used to assess the difference between treatment arms.

Unresectable Locally Advanced/ Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the 
Pancreas  
Title of Study:  
A Randomized  Controlled, Open label, Adaptive Phase -3 Trial to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of 
EndoTAG- 1 Plus Gemcitabine versus Gemcitabine alone  in Patients with Measurable Locally 
Advanced and/or Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas  Failed on FOLFIRINOX Treatment  
Study Center(s): Up to 100 multinational centers  
Planned Number of Subjects:  
A total of 218 (109 per arm) subjects will be randomized.  Study Development Phase:  Phase  3
 
Indication for Use: Lipid Complexed Paclitaxel (EndoTAG-1) , in combination with gemcitabine , 
is indicated for the c ombination regimen in patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  who are eligible for second- line therapy after failing first -line 
therapy w ith FOLFIRINOX . 
Study Rationale:  
EndoTAG- 1 is a novel formulation of cationic liposomes for the treatment of solid tumors, carrying 
paclitaxel embedded in the liposome membrane. Cationic liposomes are known to bind and 
internalize at tumor endothelial cells after intravenous administration, which is the basis for the 
new mode of action of EndoTAG -1. Using a cationic liposome formulation, the cytostatic and 
cytotoxic activities of paclitaxel are targeted to the activated tumor endothelial cells. Therefor e, in 
contrast to conventional chemotherapy aiming at tumor -cell toxicity, EndoTAG -1 specifically 
displays antivascular and antiangiogenic activity. 
Based on the results of preclinical studies and clinical phase 1/2  studies and its new therapeutic 
concept,  EndoTAG- 1 represents a promising candidate for the treatment of solid malignancies, 
both for taxane- sensitive and taxane- insensitive tumors.  
Pancreatic cancer, which is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the United States (Jemal et al. 
2008), is an indication with high need for improvement of systemic therapy. Less than 20% of 
pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed with resectable and potentially curable disease while the vast majority of patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis with  a median survival of 
approximately 6 months.  
FOLFIRINOX regimen is the standard first -line treatment for  pancreatic cancer patients with good 
performance status. However, the optimal management strategy for patients who fail initial 
FOLFIRINOX remains un defined. There is still no standard of care in second- line therapy for 
patients with disease progression. 
Gemcitabine has been the standard systemic therapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer for the last decade, though 1- year survival rates ranging around 18% are still unsatisfactory (Burris et al. 1997;

Moore et al. 2007). Numerous trials have aimed to demonstrate superiority of combinations of 
gemcitabine with other chemotherapeutics or targeted agents with disappointing results.  
Results of a controlled , randomized Phase 2  clinical trial comprising 200 patients indicate a 
considerable survival benefit for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with EndoTAG -
1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine monotherapy. 
The aim of this  adaptive Phase 3  trial is to show a statistically significant superiority of EndoTAG -
1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with locally 
advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer  after FOLFIRINOX  failure . 
Objectives:  
The objective of the study is to assess the safety  and efficacy of a combination therapy  of 
EndoTAG- 1 plus gemcitabine vs. gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with locally advanced 
and/or metastatic  adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  eligible for second- line therapy after failing first -
line therapy w ith FOLFIRINOX . 
Efficacy  Objectives:  
To assess the efficacy of twice weekly infusions of EndoTAG -1 with weekly infusions of  
gemcitabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy according to: 
• Assessment of survival (overall  survival [OS] , progression -free survival [PFS ]) 
• Tumor response evaluation via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 
(RECIST v.1.1) 
Safety  Objectives:  
To assess the safety of twice weekly infusions of EndoTAG -1 with weekly infusions of  
gemc itabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy according to: 
• Incidence and percentage of subject s with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Laboratory abnormalities (hematology, coagulation parameters, clinical chemistry) 
• Dose reductions, pausing, and/or discontinuation of EndoTAG-1 and/or gemcitabine 
Endpoints:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint s: 
• Overall survival (OS) 
Overall survival time is defined as time from randomization to death from any cause or last 
day known to be alive.  
• Progression Free Survival (PFS)  
Progression Free Survival time is defined as the time from randomization to either first 
observation of progressive disease or occurrence of death.

The randomization will be stratified by  
• Subjects with locally advanced vs metastatic pancreatic cancer  
• Subject s with ECOG performance status 0 vs 1  
The first treatment cycle will last at least 8 wee ks and include 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week 
rest followed by 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week rest . Subjects may continue to recei ve additional 
cycles of therapy until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity as per clinical judgment of the 
Investigator.  
Tumor response according to RECIST (version 1.1; Eisenhauer et al . 2009) will be evaluated on a 
scheduled basis every 8 weeks ( ±3 days) from randomization (regardless of the timing of treatment 
cycles) until disease progression is documented or until the cut -off date of the study, whichever 
comes earlier. Subject s will be monitored regularly for safety parameters, pain and quality of life.   
After completing treatment, subjects who are not diagnosed with progressive disease (PD) will 
attend up to 6 F ollow -up V isits every 8 weeks for 48 weeks, following which subjects will be 
followed -up by telephone every 8 weeks for survival. Subjec ts who experienced PD during 
Treatment Phase will undergo only one safety follow- up visit (4 -8 weeks after the E OT visit), and 
then enter phone follow -up directly. Follow -up visits will be performed for the evaluation of 
survival status, safety parameters,  QoL ( EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC PAN -26) and 
administration of other anti -tumor treatment until death or end of the study, whichever comes first. 
Anti- tumor therapy after termination of study treatment will be at the discretion of the Investigator.  
A single,  pre-planned Interim Analysis (IA) will be conducted when approximately 101 subjects

Dose Modifications for Non- Hematologic Adverse Reactions  
Permanently discontinue gemcitabine for any of the following:  
• Unexplained dyspnea or other evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity  
• Severe hepatic toxicity  
• Hemolytic -uremic syndrome  
• Capillary leak syndrome  
• Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome  
Note: Withhold gemcitabine  or reduce dose by 50% for other severe (Grade 3 or 4) non-
hematological toxicity until resolved. No dose modifications are recommended for alopecia, 
nausea, o r vomiting.  
If a subject  fails to meet criteria for retreatment on the day the next treatment is scheduled,

be omitted for a maximum of 2 weeks. If treatment is  omitted for >1 week, a new cycle should be 
started upon continuation of treatment. Any subject  who fails to recover from a treatment related 
adverse event to baseline or Grade 2  within 2 weeks of scheduled retreatment will be withdrawn 
from the study with the exception of subject s who benefit from study treatment (non -progressive 
disease according to RECIST  v.1.1 ), who may continue treatment on study after consultation and 
approval of the Sponsor. 
Subjects assigned to Arm A (EndoTAG -1 plus Gemcitabine) 
Subject s may start a new cycle of combination therapy if ANC is > 1,500/mm3, platelets are > 
100,000/mm3 and treatment -related non- hematologic adverse event including neuropathy has 
resolved  to baseline or Grade 2. Subjects with Grade 2 neuropathy will not  be retreated until 
resolved to Grade 1. 
Note: Subject s on treatment arm A who require discontinuation of gemcitabine will not continue 
on single -agent E ndoTAG- 1 alone. However, subjects in Treatment A rm A who require 
discontinuation of EndoTAG -1 due to toxicity may continue on gemcitabine monotherapy. 
Subjects on A rm B ( gemcitabine alone) will not be offered treatment with EndoTAG -1 at the time 
of discontinuation (no cross- over allowed).  
Statistical Considerations:  
Sample Size Determin ation and Rationale :  
A total of 21 8 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A (EndoTAG-1 plus 
gemcitabine) and Arm B (gemcitabine monotherapy). The sample size is event -driven to collect a 
pre-specified number of primary efficacy outcomes. Based on the  sample size calculation, the 
primary endpoint analysis for overall survival will require 16 7 events (deaths)  for 196 subjects . 
The primary endpoint analysis for progression- free survival will require 169 events (disease 
progression) from 182 subjects.  This sample size is sufficient to detect a 40% reduction in the risk 
of death in Arm A, as compared with Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.60) using a 2- sided log- rank test with 
90% power and an overall significance level of 0.05 two sided test.  This sample size is al so 
sufficient to detect a 35% reduction of progressive free survival in the risk of disease progression 
in Arm A, as compared with Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.647) using a 2- sided log- rank test with more 
than 80% power and an overall significance level of 0.05 two sided test. Sample size estimation is 
depicted in  Figure 9-1  and Figure 9-2, total sample size requirement vs. the median survival time 
(month) in the treatment arm.  
A dropout rate of 10% is factored in the sample size calculations  for a total sample size of 218 
subjects. Sample size is estimated using PASS ( 15) sample size software.  
The overall survival assumption for the sample size are based on published literature data 
comparing therapeutic effect of gemcitabine monotherapy and gemcitabine combination regimen 
on patients with advanced pancreatic cancer after previous FOLFIRINOX treatment. The hazard 
ratio for death of 0.60 with median overall survival of 4.4 months for gemcitabine monotherapy 
(Conroy et al. 2011) and 7.3 months for gem citabine + paclitaxel combina tion (Portal et al. 2015) 
was used for the sample size calculation.  The progression- free survival assumption for the sample

size are based on hazard ratio of 0.647 with median progression -free survival of 3.3 months for 
gemcitabine monotherapy (Conroy et a l. 2011) and 5.1 months for gemcitabine + paclitaxel 
combination (Portal et al. 2015) was used for the sample size calculation. 
Randomization and Stratification:   
Prior to randomization, subjects will be stratified by extent of disease (subjects with locally 
advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer) and the performance status ( ECOG performance status 
0 and 1).  Then they will be randomized with a 1:1 ratio. 
Analysis Populations:  
The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population  is defined as all subjects ran domized regardless of actual 
treatment received. The ITT population will be the primary population for the analysis of primary 
and secondary endpoints.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population is defined as the set of subjects who meet the ITT population 
requirem ents, and were not associated with a major protocol violation. This population will be 
identified before the database lock.  
The Safety population is defined as any subject receiving the treatment after randomization. This 
population will be used for the a nalysis of safety parameters.  
Analysis Considerations:  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP ) accompanies the protocol and any amendments to the 
SAP will be finalized prior to final database lock. Any significant changes to the analyses described 
in this protocol will be highlighted in the SAP and the Clinical Study Report. 
Analysis of time -to-event parameters ( OS, PFS) : times to event will be estimat ed together with the 
respective 95% CIs for each treatment group using the  Kaplan -Meie r method. The log- rank test 
(stratification factors ECOG and TNM) will be calculated for comparison of OS and PFS for the 
combination therapy treatment versus the gemcitabine monotherapy group. 
Tumor response : Fo r each  subject , the overall response to treatment after the initial 7 -week 
treatment  cycle will be  assessed according to RECIST v.1.1 criteria.  The proportions of subject s 
with CR, PR, OR, SD, PD, disease control ( CR, PR or  SD), at the end of cycle 1, as well as the 
overall response to treatment, will be calculated  for each treatment group and presented with exact 
95% confidence intervals (CIs).  
Change from baseline in CA 19-9: The proportion of subjects with a change from normal to 
abnormal, no change, or a change from abnormal to normal, and the proportion of subject s with a 
response w ill be calculated. Exact 95% CIs will be calculated for the proportion of subject s with a  
change from abnormal to normal and for the proportion of subject s with a response.  
Change from baseline in QLQ -C30 and PAN -26: Differences in proportions between treatment 
groups will be estimated and exact 95% CIs will be calculated for these estimates. These analyses 
will be performed  for al l individual QoL score s, QLQ -C30 Global  Health score and for the PAN -
26 score at the end of t reatment cycle 1 and  also for the full treatment course.

1.1 Background Information 
Pancreatic cancer, which is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the United States 
(Jemal et al. 2008), is an indication with high need for improvement of systemic therapy. 
Less than 20% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed with resectable and 
potentially curable disease while the vast majority of patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis with a median survival of approximately 6 months.  
FOLFIRINOX regimen is the standard first -line treatment for pancreatic cancer patients 
with good performance status. However, the optimal management strategy for patients 
who fail initial FOLFIRINOX remains undefined. There is still no standard of care in second -line therapy for patients with disease progression.  
Gemcitabine has been the standard systemic therapy for unresectable pancreatic cancer for the last decade, though 1 -year survival rates ranging around 18% are still 
unsatisfactory (Burris et al. 1997; Moore et al. 2007). Numerous trials have aimed to demonstrate superiority of combinations of gemcitabine with other chemotherapeutics or targeted agents with disappointing results.  
Results of a controlled, randomized Phase 2 clinical trial comprising 200 patients indicate a considerable survival benefit for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with EndoTAG -1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine 
monotherapy. 
The aim of this adaptive Phase 3 trial is to show a statistically significant superiority of EndoTAG- 1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine monotherapy 
in patients with locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer after FOLFI RINOX 
failure.  
1.2 EndoTAG -1 
EndoTAG- 1 is a novel formulation of cationic liposomes for the treatment of solid 
tumors, carrying paclitaxel embedded in the liposome membrane. Cationic liposomes are known to bind and internalize at tumor endothelial cells after intravenous administration, which is the basis for the new mode of action of EndoTAG -1. Using a 
cationic liposome formulation, the cytostatic and cytotoxic activities of paclitaxel are targeted to the activated tumor endothelial cells. Therefore, in contrast to conventional chemotherapy aiming at tumor -cell toxicity, EndoTAG -1 specifically displays 
antivascular and antiangiogenic activity.  
EndoTAG- 1 was first developed by Munich Biotech AG (Germany) under the names 
LipoPac and MBT -0206 and by Medigene AG under the name of EndoTAG -1. Since 
2013, development and global commercialization of EndoTAG -1 is executed by 
SynCore Biotechnology Co., Ltd.  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 39 of 125 EndoTAG- 1 is formed by the synthetic cationic lipid dioleoyl -trimethylammonium-
propane chloride (DOTAP -Cl) and the n atural neutral phospholipid dioleoyl -
phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). In an aqueous solution of trehalose, liposomal 
membranes embedded with paclitaxel are assembled.  
1.2.1 Non-clinical studies using EndoTAG -1 
EndoTAG- 1, when given intravenously in a variety of syngeneic and xenograft tumor 
models in mice  and hamster, showed a pronounced higher uptake into tumor tissue 
compared to normal tissue. In all models tested, EndoTAG -1 led to a significantly 
reduced tumor growth activity compared to treatment with standar d paclitaxel, 
independent of tumor type, animal species and immune status. In addition, the rate of metastasis was significantly decreased by EndoTAG -1 compared to standard paclitaxel. 
Furthermore, EndoTAG -1 was shown to be effective in paclitaxel -resistan t tumors in 
animals.  
An increased anti -tumor activity in animals was observed when EndoTAG -1 was 
combined with other cytostatic or cytotoxic agents. Combination therapy (e.g. EndoTAG-1 + gemcitabine) showed enhanced tumor regression, reduction of lymph 
node metastases and absence of liver metastases compared to either monotherapy. In vitro, combination therapies of Endo TAG -1 with chemotherapeutics showed complete 
or concentration-dependent additivity, thus supporting the in vivo data. 
Mode-of- action studies in rodents demonstrated the neovascular targeting properties of  
EndoT AG-1. A strong decrease of the endothelial proliferation index in the tumor 
periphery as well as a reduction of the tumor perfusion index and an increase of 
endothelial cell apoptosis was observed. These results indicate a potential dual mode -
of-action of  EndoTAG- 1 by combining anti -neovascular and anti -tumor effects 
(Eichhorn et al 2010, Strieth et al 2008, Strieth et al 2004, Schmitt-Sody et al 2003). 
Toxicology 
The t oxicological profile of EndoTAG -1 has been evaluated in single - and repeated -
dose toxicity studies in mice, rats and dogs covering treatment periods of up to 26 weeks.  
In an acute toxicity study in mice mortality was observed at 5.4 mg/kg BW liposomal 
paclitaxel.  The same m ortality was reported in the control group using empty liposomes 
and was most likely due to the large volumes of injected suspended lipid complexes. No other findings were reported in the acute toxicity studies. 
In subchronic toxicity studies in rats the high dose EndoTAG -1 group (1.5 mg/kg BW 
liposomal paclitaxel) showed slight weight loss and reduction of white blood cells. The 
main histopathological finding was hypocellularity of the hematopoetic bone marrow in about one third of the rats in this dose gr oup. The effects were reversible and resolved 
during recovery. 
Acute, subchronic and chronic repeated dose toxicity studies have been performed in 
dogs. In the 14- day and 28 -day studies liposomal paclitaxel doses up to 1.7 mg/kg BW  
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 40 of 125 and 1.5 mg/kg BW , respectively,  per application were given daily or every other day. 
At higher doses reduced food uptake accompanied by a moderate but continuous 
reduction in body weight was observed and lesions were found in the gastrointestinal tract - findings which are attributed to the action of paclitaxel. With daily treatment, 
lethal toxicity was observed in all dose groups. When dosed at 2- day intervals, 
treatment was tolerated better and only some animals of the higher dose groups died. In the 90- day and 180- day studies, doses up to 1.2 mg/kg BW were applied twice a 
week, resulting in a total of 22 to 27 and 46 applications, respectively. Due to severe 
toxicities including mortality observed in the high dose group, treatment was interrupted and, in part, reduced to one application per week.  
A "no observed adverse effect level" (NOAEL) could not be established in studies covering a treatment period of 3 or 6 months, which is common for cytostatic and cytotoxic drugs with low therapeutic index. The non- clinical toxicity studi es indicate 
that the haematopoietic system, the gastrointestinal tract including the liver and the gall bladder and the male gonads are the potential target organs in humans. Microscopic lesions were seen mainly in areas of high tissue tu rn-over such as th e gastrointestinal 
tract and the testes. Based on acute findings (hemorrhagic pulmonary edema) observed in a number of animals that died prematurely in the subchronic and chronic toxicity studies in dogs, the lung represents an additional target organ. Dur ing clinical 
application of EndoTAG -1 the function of these organ systems should be closely 
monitored. Other known side effects of standard paclitaxel were not observed during administration of EndoTAG- l. 
Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic profile of EndoTAG- 1 has been established in single dose studies 
in mice and rats and in repeated dose toxicokinetic studies in rats and dogs. The highest 
systemic exposure of paclitaxel from EndoTAG -1 was observed in humans and dogs, 
and the lowest in rats and mice. These findings were in line with the clearance rates observed, which were low for non- rodents (humans/ dogs) and high for rodents (rats/ 
mice).  
A linear pharmacokinetic relationship was determined for the administered EndoTAG -
1 dose and the C
max and AUC of paclitaxel in rats and dogs. The pharmacokinetic 
profiles of paclitaxel from EndoTAG -1 compared to standard paclitaxel in rodents 
seemed to be almost identical at lower doses (1.1 mg/ kg BW liposomal paclitaxel), whereas at higher doses (5 mg/ kg BW liposomal paclitaxel) Cmax and AUC values of paclitaxel from EndoTAG -1 were markedly lower. No comparative studies have been 
performed in non-rodents. 
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated comparable metabolism of  paclitaxel for 
EndoTAG- 1 and sta ndard paclitaxel. Both agents resulted in similar biodistribution 
patterns and kinetics in female rats. The highest concentration of paclitaxel was found 
in the liver, but marked concentrations were also observed in kidney, lung, heart, spleen 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 41 of 125 and adrenal gland. Paclitaxel was mainly excreted in bile ( -88% of dose) and excretion 
was almost completed after 72 hours for both EndoTAG- 1 and standard paclitaxel.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of the cationic liposomal constituent DO TAP is 
characterized by a linear relationship between the administered EndoTAG -1 dose and 
Cmax and AUC. In contrast to paclitaxel a later C max was observed for DOTAP. It 
appears to be slowly distributed and is incompletely cleared from systemic blood 
circulation. The results of the biodis tribution study in female rats sh owed that a large 
amount of DOT AP is transiently distributed to the lungs and relatively high levels are 
maintained  until a marked decrease of DOTAP occurred between 6 -24 hours. In 
contrast, liver, kidneys and spleen s howed a gradual increase of DOT AP levels up to 
6-24 hours. DOTAP was mainly excreted in the urine (78% of dose) and excretion 
occurred rather slowly. After 5 days, 9.2% of the dose was still present in the body. Consequently, accumulation of DOT AP was observed in the plasma of rats and dogs 
when EndoTAG -1 was administered twice per week for 26 weeks, but was not 
associated with a notable increase in toxicities.  
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes suggested either the absence of or only a weak Cytochrome P450 inhibition potential for DOTAP, whereas Cremophor EL, the 
excipient of standard paclitaxel, turned out to be a very potent Cytochrome P450 inhibitor. 
1.2.2 Clinical studies using EndoTAG -1 
A total of 4 60 subject s with a variety of solid tumors have been treated with EndoTAG -
1 during participation in clinical studies.  
Nine clinical studies (phase 1/2) were initiated by the company Munich Biotech AG 
(MBT), which originally started the development of EndoTAG -1. Various doses (2.63 
- 66 mg/m
2 liposomal paclitax el), infusion speeds (up to 2.5 m L/min) and schedules 
(daily to weekly, for up to nine weeks) were examined in these studies. In these studies, a total of 163 subject s were treated with EndoTAG -1. EndoTAG -1 was usually given 
as a monotherapy except for one  study in NSCLC (combination with carboplatin) and 
one study in gastrointestinal cancer (combination with 5- FU). 
At MediGene AG, three phase 2 trials have been conducted:  
• CT4001, an open- label, randomized, controlled Phase 2 study in 200 subject s with 
locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a combination therapy of gemcitabine (Gemzar
®) and EndoTAG -1 
at three different dose levels (corresponding to 11, 22 and 44 mg/m2 paclitaxel) 
versus gemcit abine monotherapy. EndoTAG -1 in combination with gemcitabine 
was generally well tolerated, corroborating the favorable safety profile observed in the Phase 1/2 studies. In terms of  efficacy, the results indicate  a survival benefit in 
subject s receiving EndoTAG- 1 in combination with gemcitabine compared to 
gemcitabine alone, both for progression-free and overall survival. 
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 42 of 125 • CT4002 was an open- label, randomized, controlled Phase 2 study to assess the 
efficacy and safety of treatment with infusions of EndoTAG -1 monotherapy 
(44mg/m² paclitaxel) twice per week or weekly infusions of EndoTAG -1 (22 mg/m² 
paclitaxel) in combination with standard paclitaxel (70 mg/m²) compared with 
paclitaxel monotherapy (90 mg/m² weekly) in 140 subject s with locally relapsed 
and/or me tastatic triple receptor -negative breast cancer (TNBC). Treatment with 
EndoTAG- 1 alone or in combination was well tolerated with manageable adverse 
events. The PFS rate at week 16, the primary efficacy endpoint, was 59.1% on combination therapy, 34.2% on E ndoTAG- 1 and 48.0% on paclitaxel. Exact one -
sided 95% CIs revealed that the hypothesis H0 (PFS rate ≤ 30%) could be rejected 
for the EndoTAG -1/paclitaxel combination group only. For a subgroup of subject s 
with confirmed TNBC, ECOG 0/1 at baseline and recei ving first -line therapy for 
advanced disease, a median OS of 17.8, 11.9, and 10.1 months was achieved by the 
three treatment groups, respectively. These results indicate that EndoTAG -1 in 
combination with standard paclitaxel could be an efficacious and saf e first -line 
therapy for patients with advanced TNBC. 
• CT4003 was an open- label, uncontrolled Phase 2 study evaluating the single -dose 
and steady -state pharmacokinetics of EndoTAG -1 and its effect on the blood supply 
and the angiogenesis of hepatic metastas es in 20 subject s with a carcinomatous 
primary tumor other than hepatocellular (HCC), biliary or bile duct carcinoma.  
An investigator initiated trial (IJBNeoEndoTAG -1) was conducted at the Institute Jules 
Bordet in Brussels, Belgium. This study was an open- label, uncontrolled, single - center 
trial in 15 subject s with HER2 -negative breast cancer who were candidates for surgery, 
including 6 subject s with TNBC. The objective of this study was to evaluate efficacy 
and safety of neoadjuvant EndoTAG -1 (22 mg/m² paclitaxel) in combination with 
standard paclitaxel (70 mg/m²) administered as 12 weekly infusions, followed by fluorouracil (500mg/m
2), epirubicin (100mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (500mg/m2) 
(FEC) administered every 3 weeks for a total of 9 weeks. The safet y results were as 
expected from previous trials. Treatment with EndoTAG -1 plus paclitaxel resulted in 
significant reduction of MRI -estimated tumor volume and linear tumor size compared 
with baseline. Overall, a pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved in 33% of the subject s. Of the 6 subject s with TNBC, 5 subject s achieved pCR.  
Safety 
Safety data of 16 3 subject s suffering from various solid tumors are available from phase 
1/2 studies. 138 (84.6%) subject s experienced one or more adverse events (AEs),  902 
AEs were reported in total. Most of these events were assessed as being causally related to study medication by the investigator (668 of 902, or 74%) and were classified as non-serious (830 of 902, or 92%). The majority of these non- serious adverse drug reactions 
(ADR's) were of transient nature. Only 20 (2.2 %) AEs were assessed as serious and drug- related by the investigator.  
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 43 of 125 In study CT 4001, AEs were reported in 92% to 100% of subject s in each treatment 
arm. No unexpected toxicities have been observed. During the first treatment cycle, 
severe hematological toxicities (grade 3/4 NCI -CTC) related to any study medication 
occurred in 22, 32 and 40% of subject s in the different GEM+Endo groups (11, 22 and 
44 mg/m2, respectively) compared to 24% on Gem mo notherapy. Combination of 
EndoTAG- 1 and Gem resulted in a dose  dependent increase of grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia reaching up to 16% and 14% in the two higher dose levels, albeit without clinical symptoms or bleeding complications. At the highest EndoTAG -1 dose 
level (44mg/m
2 twice weekly), increased rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia (22%) and 
anemia (12%) were observed. During the first cycle, a total of 7 cases of febrile neutropenia were reported in the two higher GEM+Endo dose levels, including 4 cases of grade 3/4. During additional cycles with GEM+Endo therapy, none was observed. Infusion- related reactions, predominantly pyrexia and chills, were found to a higher 
extent in GEM+Endo groups, whereas the addition of EndoTAG -1 to Gem did not 
increase the known liver toxicity of Gem. In the GEM+Endo44 arm, one case of neuropathy was reported in a subject  with diabetes, but was considered unrelated to 
study medication.  
AEs resulting in discontinuation of study medication were reported in 4 subjects (8%) 
in the GEM +Endo11 and 7 subject s (14%) in each of the GEM+Endo22 and 
GEM+Endo44 group. During the first cycle, 2 subject s (4%) in each of the 
GEM+Endo 11 and GEM+Endo22 group, and 1 subject  (2%) in the GEM+Endo44 
group died, but deaths were considered not related to study medication. During additional cycles, another 2 subject s of the GEM+Endo11 group had SAEs with fatal 
outcome. Both events, Staphylococcal sepsis and death from unknown cause, were considered unlikely to be related to study medication. 
In study CT4002 safety analysis revealed qualitatively and quantitatively the known 
toxicities of EndoTAG -1 and standard paclitaxel. AEs were reported in 91% to 100% 
of subject s in each treatment arm. No unexpected toxicities have been observed. 
EndoTAG- 1 showed a simila r safety profile to paclitaxel. On combination treatment, a 
slight increase in grade 3/4 adverse events was observed compared to either 
monotherapy, with uncomplicated neutropenia being the most predominant adverse event. Neutropenia was highest among subj ects on combination therapy (40%), 
whereas anemia was predominantly observed in the standard paclitaxel study arm (36%). Grade 3/4 hematological toxicities, especially neutropenia and leucopenia, occurred more often in the combination arm (20% and 7%) compared to either agent alone (4% and 2% for  EndoTAG- 1 monotherapy, 7% and 0% for standard paclitaxel, 
respectively) (Awada et al , 2010).  
As was observed in CT4001, infusion- related reactions, predominantly pyrexia and 
chills were fo und to a higher extent in EndoTAG- 1 treatment arms and increased at 
higher doses. Peripheral sensory neuropathy was observed in 13% of the combination treatment arm compared to 9% and 14% of subject s on EndoTAG -1 monotherapy and 
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 44 of 125 standard paclitaxel, respectively. Severe neurotoxici ty was reported for 1 subject  (4%) 
of the standard paclitaxel treatment arm.  
In study CT4003 all 20 subject s experienced at least one AE, with a total of 330 AEs 
reported. 33 AEs of grade 3/4 and 21 SAEs were observed and reported from 11 (55%) 
subject s. The most frequent AEs were abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fatigue in 
10 to 14 subject s (50 -70%). Hypersensitivity and hyperhidrosis occurred in 8 subject s 
each (40%) and were mostly of mild to moderate severity. Hematological toxicities were observed  in 4 subject s (20%), including 3 events of anemia and 1 event each of 
neutropenia and leucopenia (both of grade 3 severity). Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported for 3 subjects (15%). No AE with a severity of grade 4 was reported. 
Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic properties of EndoTAG -1 were determined in three phase 1/2 
dose escalation studies ( CTLP01 , CTLP05 and CTLP06) exploring several dose levels 
(2.63- 66 mg/m2 paclitaxel) and application regimen (2 -5 times per week) and in study 
CT4003. 
Results of studies CTLP01, CTLP05 and CTLP06 revealed that the maximum plasma 
concentrations and extents of  exposure of paclitaxel and DOT AP, administered as 
EndoTAG-1, increased with the dose. Data were too limited to assess whether the 
increase is proportional. The clearance of paclitaxel and DOTAP remained constant with increasing doses, with higher clearance levels observed  for paclitaxel compared to 
DOT AP. There was no indication for paclitaxel accumulation in plasma at any dose 
level or application regimen studied. Although DOTAP is cleared from the plasma slowly, there was also no evidence for accumulation of DOTAP. 
In study CT4003 reliable PK -profiles were obtained for paclitaxel and DOTAP after 
single dose and in steady state following intravenous infusion of  EndoTAG -1 (22 
mg/m
2 twice weekly for 25 days). The pharmacokinetic parameters observed for 
paclitaxel and DOTAP confirmed previous results with 22 mg/m2 EndoTAG- 1 from 
early clinical trials (CTLP05, CTLP06). The mean maximum plasma concentration of 
paclitaxel was comparable after single dose and in steady state. The extent of exposure showed a small increase from the first to the last dose. The mean maxim um plasma 
concentration of DOT AP increased from the first to the last dose and the extent of 
exposure increased more pronounced compared to paclitaxel. Distribution and elimination kinetics of EndoT AG-1 appear to be largely comparably to standard 
paclitaxel at lower dose levels. Only minor accumulation has been observed for paclitaxel and DOT AP, suggesting that no considerable saturation of distribution or 
elimination systems occurred. Finally, consistent gender -specific differences have not 
been observed with respect to the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and DOT AP (Fasol et 
al, 2011). 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of EndoTAG -1, paclitaxel  and DOTAP were 
evaluated using the pooled data collected from three phase 1/2 dose- escalation studies

EndoTAG-1 dated 28- Feb-2017. 
Efficacy 
In their phase 1/2 studies, Munich Biotech AG included patients with hormone -
refra ctory prostate cancer (CTLP 01), unresectable locally advanced or metastatic 
gastrointestinal (CTLP 05) or colorectal cancer (CTLP10) and metastatic breast cancer 
(CTLP09) applying doses between 2.63 and 66 mg/m2 liposomal paclitaxel in various 
regimen of up to 9 weeks treatment. Subject s were evaluated for overall tumor response 
only, survival data were not collected. Complete responses were not reported. Partial 
responses were observed in 3 (8%, CTLP09) and 1 (3%, CTLP 010) subject s, stable 
disease was seen in 13 (36%, CTLP09), 3 (8%, CTLP 010) and 4 (14%, CTLP05) of the 
subject s. Accordingly the clinical benefit rate was 44% and 11% in CTLP09 and 
CTLP10 , respectively. The effect on tumor stabilization was most distinct in subject s 
with metastatic breast cance r (CTLP09) with a dose -dependent effect on the rate of 
subject s with non- progressive disease (33% at 22 mg/m2, 56% at 44 mg/m2). In study 
CTLP01 , PSA levels remained stable in the majority of subject s during treatment, but 
increased during the follow -up period. 1/12 (8.33%) of subject s showed stable disease 
(reduction of PSA levels > 50%) after 43 days. 
In summary, disease stabilization and partial response has been observed in some of the 
subject s. However, subject numbers were small and studies were conducted without 
comparator(s). Phase II studies of MediGene AG were conducted in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (CT4001), triple receptor -negative breast cancer (CT4002) 
and hepatic metastases from a carcino matous primary tumor (CT4003). 
In study CT4001, 3 different dose levels of EndoTAG -1 (11, 22 and 44 mg/m
2 
liposomal paclitaxel) in combination with gemcitabine (GEM+Endo) were compared to gemcitabine monotherapy (GEM) in 200 subject s (50 subject s in each s tudy arm) 
with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. At the time of analysis 161 subject s have died. Median overall survival was 7.2 months on 
GEM monotherapy compared to 8.4, 8.7 and 9.4 months in the GEM+Endo cohorts (11, 22 and 44 mg/m
2, respectively). Median PFS reached 2.7 months compared to 4.1, 4.6 
and 4.4 months and the disease control rate after the first treatment cycle was 43% compared to 60, 65 and 52%, respectively. Accordingly, both the 6 - and 12-month 
survival rates were higher in all GEM+Endo groups than in the GEM group (L öhr et al , 
2012).  
In study CT4002, 140 women with triple receptor negative metastatic or relapsed breast cancer have been randomized to 3 different study arms: EndoTAG -1 (22 mg/m
2 
liposomal paclitaxel) in combination with  standard paclitaxel (70 mg/m2), EndoTAG -
1 monotherapy (44 mg/m2 liposomal paclitaxel, twice per week), and standard 
paclitaxel monotherapy (90 mg/m2). Each treatment was given for 3 weeks, followed 
by 1 week of rest. The dis ease control rate at week 16, after 4 cycles of therapy, was 
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 46 of 125 59% on combination therapy compared to 34% in the EndoTAG -1 and 48% in the 
standard paclitaxel cohort (Awada et al , ESMO 2010). The clinical benefit rate 
(complete or partial response at  any time  and stable disease 2: 6 months) on combination 
of EndoTAG -1 and paclitaxel (n=50 subject s) was 53% compared to 31 and 36% on 
EndoTAG- 1 and paclitaxel monotherapies, respectively (Awada et al , SABCS 2011). 
PFS was 4.2 compared to 3.4 and 3.7 months, respectively. In the target population of 
the study, i.e. patients with TNBC, the overall survival was 13.0 months on combination of EndoTAG -1 and paclitaxel versus 11.9 and 10.1 months on EndoTAG -1 and 
paclitaxel monotherapies, respectively. Subgroup analysis in  subject s with advanced 
TNBC, ECOG performance status 0 or 1 and first line therapy revealed an overall 
survival of 17.8 months on combination of EndoTAG-1 and paclitaxel versus 12.5 and 10.1 months on EndoTAG-1 and paclitaxel monotherapies, respectively. However, the study was not powered for intergroup comparisons. 
Study CT4003 was conducted to evaluate pharmacokinetics of EndoTAG -1 (22 mg/m
2 
liposomal paclitaxel, twice a week) and its effect on blood supply and angiogenesis of 
hepatic metastases in 20 su bject s with a carcinomatous primary tumor other than 
hepatocellular, biliary or bile duct carcinoma. At the beginning of therapy all subject s 
had stable disease according to modified RECIST 1.1 criteria. The median PFS was 29 days. The effect of EndoTAG -1 on target liver metastases perfusion assessed by CEUS 
was inhomogeneous, inflow coefficients showed a great intra -individual variability and 
a trend could not be elaborated. However, changes in perfusion parameters assessed by DCE -MRI were observed. By Day  29, 65% of subject s had decreases in k
trans, iAUC60, 
iAUC90 and iAUC 120, supporting the hypothesis of a vascular targeting mode of 
action of EndoTAG- 1 (Fasol et al , 2011). 
In conclusion, EndoT AG-1 has shown vascular targeting, vascular disrupting and anti-
tumor activity in different tumors in several nonclinical and clinical studies. Therapeutic efficacy was highest when EndoTAG -1 was administered in combination 
with other chemotherapeutics. Notably, both in pancreatic cancer  and advanced TNBC , 
EndoTAG- 1 has shown clinical benefit and the EndoTAG -1/paclitaxel and EndoTAG-
1/gemcitabine treatment combination was  well tolerated . 
Based on the safety and efficacy data collected in these clinical trials, a positive benefit -
risk-profile was established for clinica l use of EndoTAG-1.

3.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized controlled, open label, adaptive phase  3 study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of a combination regimen of twice weekly infusions of EndoTAG -
1 (Lipid Complexed Paclitaxel)  with weekly administration of gemcitabine compared 
with gemcitabine monotherapy in subjects with measurable locally advanced and/or 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who are eligible for second -line therapy 
after failing first- line therapy with FOLFIRINOX.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms: 
 Arm A:  Treatment with EndoTAG -1 22 mg/m2 twice weekly plus gemcitabine 
1000mg/m² once weekly, for 1 cycle (8 weeks) consisting of 3 weeks and 1 week 
rest followed by  3 weeks of treatment and 1 week rest until any one of the following 
occurs:  progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  Subjects will be eligible for continuing treatment beyond first cycle in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Subsequent Treatment Cycles (8 weeks/cycle) will be administered as 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week of rest followed by 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week rest. 
 Arm B:  Treatment with gemcitabine 1000  mg/m² once weekly, for 1 cycle (8 weeks)  
consisting of 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week rest followed by 3 weeks of treatment 
and 1 week rest until any one of the following occurs:  progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent . Subjects will be eligible for 
continuing treatment beyond in absence of disease progression of unacceptable 
toxicity. Subsequent Treatment Cycles  (8 weeks/cycle) will be administered as 3 
weeks of treatment and 1 week reast followed by 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week rest. 
The randomization will be stratified by  
• Subjects with locally advanced vs metastatic pancreatic cancer  
• Subjects with ECOG performance status 0 vs 1 
The first treatment cycle will last at least 8 weeks and include  3 weeks of treatment and 
1 week rest followed by 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week rest . Subjects may continue 
to receive additional cycles of therapy until progressive di sease or intolerable toxicity 
as per clinical judgment of the Investigator. 
Tumor response according to RECIST (version 1.1; Eisenhauer et al . 2009) will be 
evaluated on a scheduled basis every 8 weeks (±3 days) from randomization (regardless 
of the timing  of treatment cycles) until disease progression is documented or until the 
cut-off date of the study, whichever comes earlier. Subjects will be monitored regularly 
for safety parameters  and quality of life (EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC PAN-26).  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 51 of 125 After completin g treatment, subjects who are not diagnosed with progressive disease 
(PD) will attend up to 6 Follow -up Visits every 8 weeks for 48 weeks, following which 
subjects will be followed -up by telephone every 8 weeks for survival. Subjects who 
experienced PD dur ing Treatment Phase will undergo only one safety follow -up visit 
(4-8 weeks after the EO T visit), and then enter phone follow -up directly. Follow -up 
visits will be performed for the evaluation of survival status, safety parameters, QoL 
(EORTC QLQ -C30 and E ORTC PAN-26) and administration of other anti -tumor 
treatment until death or end of the study, whichever comes first. 
Anti-tumor therapy after termination of study treatment will be at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  A single, pre -planned Interim Analysis (IA) will be conducted when approximately 101 
subjects have died (60% of the expected 167 events). The cut -off date for the final  analysis will be 12 months after the last subject was 
randomized or the last subject alive has been followed up for at least 48 weeks , 
whatever applies first. Subjects being still under treatment with study medication at this 
cut-off date will enter the e xtension phase of this trial. These subjects will be followed 
up until 28 days after the last administration of study medication.  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB ), composed of independent 
representatives, will be in charge of reviewing the accrual, baseline, and safety data at 
periodic intervals. Representatives of the Sponsor will serve only as coordinating members of the committee, without having full member responsibilities or privileges.

The study is divided into three phases: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up.  
• Screening Phase (Screening to Baseline):  Up to 14 days 
• Treat ment Phase:   
o First Treatment Cycle:  
 T reatment Group A : 8 weeks or potentially longer in the event of 
postponements ( a total of 6  weekly infusions of gemcitabine and 12 twice 
weekly infusions of EndoTAG- 1). 
 Treatment Group B : 8  weeks or potentially longer in the event of 
postponements ( a total of 6  weekly infusions of gemcitabine).  
o S ubsequent Treatment Cycles: Subjects will be eligible for continuing treatment 
with 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week rest followed by 3 weeks of treatment 
and 1 week rest until any one of the following occurs : progressive disease or 
unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  
• Follow- Up Phase:  Follow -up visits will be performed every 8 weeks until death or 
end of the study, whichever comes first. 
Procedures to be performed during each of these study phases are described below and 
provided as a Schedule of Assessments in  Table 0-1 and Table 0-2. 
4.1 Screening Visit  
The subject (or Legally Acceptable R epresentative (LAR)) will sign and date the 
informed consent form ( ICF) and Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 
(HIPAA ) authori zation (according to site policy and practices) prior to any study -
related procedures. A unique identification number (screening number) will be assigned 
to each subject who has provided written informed consent. The subject screening 
number will incorpora te a two-digit region code (01, 02 or 03...), a three -digit Study 
Center number (001, 002 or 003….) and a three- digit numeric ID assigned in successive 
order of entering the study after signing the ICF at each center, beginning with 001 at 
each site (e.g. 01-001-001).  
 
Subject Screening 
#: XX - YYY  - ZZZ  
 XX=Region   YYY=Study Center   ZZZ=Subject Numeric ID  
All study centers will be instructed to maintain the study -specific pre -screening, 
screening and enrollment logs at their sites. If a subject initially fails to meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and is later reconsidered for participation, the subject will be re-consented and assigned a new screening  number at the time of re -screening.  
Subjects who fail their first screening attempt may be re -screened a maximum of once 
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 55 of 125 and may be enrolled if they are found to meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria 
when re- screened.    
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma may be  
screened. Prior to all screening procedures the investigator is responsible for explaining all aspects of this trial to the patient including potential side effects and alternative 
treatments  available. The investigator must answer all questions by the patient 
according to his/her be st knowledge and must give the patient ample time to consider 
his/her participation. If – after that - the patient wishes to participate in this trial, he/she 
must first give written informed  consent. Only then may the investigator proceed with 
the screening procedure.  
The following evaluations and examinations have to be done within 14 days prior to  
randomization, if not stated otherwise: 
• Signed informed consent 
• Eligibility criteria  
• Demographic data, including date of birth, sex, and ethnic origin

acceptable.  
• Evaluation of detected lesions according to RECI ST (version 1.1; Eisenhauer 
et al. 2009)   
• Electrocardiogram  
• Quality of Life Questionnaires  
All screening information will be fully documented in the subject’s medical records 
(i.e., source documents). If the patient fulfil s all of the inclusion criteria and none 
of the exclusion criteria the patient may be randomized.  
• F or consented subjects who do not meet  eligibility criteria , a Screen Failure 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ) will be completed.  The Screen Failure 
eCRF will contain the following details : the subject identification number, the 
date of ICF signature, demographic information, and the reason for screen failure.  No additional information will be required for subjects who fail 
screening.

5.1 Subject Completion 
o A subject who completes at least the 48 -week Follow -Up period after end (or 
discontinuation) of treatment, regardless of tumor response, will be 
considered as having completed the study. 
5.2 Withdrawal of Subject from Therapy or Assessment  
A subject who enters the Treatment Phase but does not complete the study, as defined in Section  5.1, is considered to have prematurely withdrawn from the Study. All 
subjects have the right to withdraw at any point during treatmen t without prejudice  to 
future care . It will be documented whether or not each subject completed the clinical 
study. If for any subject, study treatment or observations were discontinued, the 
reason(s) will be recorded. 
The Investigator can discontinue a subject at any time if it is considered medically 
necessary.  
In addition, subjects WILL  b
 e withdrawn from the study, in consultation with the 
Medical Monitor and the Investigator, if any of the following are met: 
• W ithdrawal of consent by subject 
• A subject is significantly non -compliant with the requirements of the protocol. 
• The investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the subject.  
• Withdrawal by investigator due to safety or ethical concerns  
• Postponement of any administration of study drug for more than four consecutive 
weeks (only applicable for initial treatment cycle)  
• Initial treatment period (cycle) lasting longer than 26 weeks (6 months) 
• A subject becomes pregnant  
Note : The pregnancy will be followed to term for safety follow -up. Relev ant safety 
information collected after the study has completed will be reported as 
supplemental information.  
• Discontinuation of study by Sponsor 
• Any major surgery  
• Chemotherapy  
Premature withdrawal from the study MAY o ccur if , in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor and the Investigator, any of the following are met:

If a subject discontinues treatment between two Treatment Visit- 8, all assessments 
scheduled for the next Treatment Visit 8 should be performed. 
Additionally, a pregnancy test should be performed when the subject discontinues 
treatment, independent of the reason for discontinuing. 
5.2.2 Data Collected  for Withdra wn Subjects  
Subject s may withdraw from the study or discontinue study treatment at any time; 
however, SynCore Biotechnology is dedicated to minimizing missing  data in this study.  
An excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study non -evaluable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided. However, subjects must be 
removed if a safety concern occurs which is regarded as clinically relevant by the investigator . Should a subject decide to withdraw, every effort will be made to complete 
and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. 
All assessments scheduled for the End of Treatment visit have to be performed if a 
subject discontinues treatment before the  End of Treatment visit. A subject prematurely 
ending active study treatment will enter the regular follow -up period. 
If a subject discontinues during the follow -up period, he/she should come in for one 
final follow -up visit and every attempt should be made to collect survival data over the 
phone. 
Investigators considering discontinuing study treatment  should contact the medical 
monitor prior to such discontinuation. Subject s who have study treatment discontinued 
will continue to  be followed, per protocol, whenever possible.  
Subject s who have study treatment discontinued due to a serious adverse event will be  
followed until resolution or stabilization  of the event.  
In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study at any time due to an adverse 
event or serious adverse event  (SAE), the procedures stated in Section 8.2 or 8.4, 
respectively  must be followed. 
Every attempt should be made to collect follow -up information. The reason for 
withdrawal from the study will be recorded in the source documents and on the appropriate page of the eCRF.  
Before a subject is identified as lost -to-follow up, the site should make all reasonable 
efforts to contact the subject. These attempts must be documented and should include at a minimum one phone call and one certified letter.  
For any subject who is lost to follow -up, the study site may attempt to ascertain survival 
information via following accesses but not limited to public database search, newspaper, 
hospital clo sed patient account.

5.3 Screen Failures  
A subject who has signed a consent form, has been assigned a screening number, but is 
not treated is classified as a screen failure. Subject number, demographics and reason for screen failure will be recorded.  
If any of the screening assessments show a clinically relevant abnormal finding, in  
particular a significantly abnormal laboratory parameter, which is in contrast to the eligibility  criteria and/or interferes with the requirements of the study in the opinion of 
the investigator, the patient will be classified as a screening failure, will not be 
randomized in the study. Nevertheless, the subject has the chance to be re- screened at 
a later time point.  
However, if a subject is dropped out of the study after randomization, he/she is not 
allowed to  be re -screened and enter the study anew.

6.1 Investigational Product (IP): EndoTAG -1 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in EndoTAG -1 is paclitaxel, which 
complies with the specifications of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.). 
Recommended International Non- proprietary Name (INN): Paclitaxel  
Compendial Name:    Paclitaxel (USP, Ph.Eur.) 
CAS Registry Number:   [33069-62-4] 
Molecular Weight:    853.9 g/mol Formula:     C
47H51NO 14 
 
Figure 6-1: Structural Formula - EndoTAG -1 (paclitaxel)  
 
EndoTAG- 1 was first developed by Munich Biotech AG (Germany) under the names 
LipoPac and MBT -0206 and by Medigene AG under the name of EndoTAG -1. Since 
2013, development and global commercialization of EndoTAG -1 is executed by 
SynCore Biotechnology Co., Ltd.  
The Investigational Product (IP) is a powder for solution for infusion that appears as a 
white caked powder. It is reconstituted with water for injection prior to application . The 
resulting solution consists of small liposomal vesicles with an intensity weighted 
average particle size <300 nm.  
The aqueous phase is a solution of trehalose and citric acid as stabilizer. Trehalose is a natural, non- reducing disaccharide at about i so-osmolal concentration (284 mosmol, 98 
mg/mL), which needs to be taken into consideration when treating diabetic patients (insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus, IDDM). Citric acid is used at a concentration of 
60 µM in solution in order to maintain a low pH and therefore to increase the chemical 
stability of the API in the liquid phase. The IP contains less than 0.5% (w/w) ethanol and has a pH of 3 to 5.

6.4 EndoTAG -1: Dose Justification 
Preclinical safety data obtained so far justify multiple administrations of EndoTAG -1 
up to a dose of 44 mg/m2 lipid complexed paclitaxel to patients. EndoTAG -1 has been 
investigated in several clinical studies and a favorable safety profile without major 
safety concerns at a dose of 44 mg/m2 lipid complexed paclitaxel has been assessed. 
Because of this and because of the complementary anti -neovascular mode of action of 
EndoTAG- 1, it is expected that there is no interference in  respect to safety and 
tolerability between EndoTAG-1 and gemcitabine. 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 71 of 125 However, due to the targeting mode of action of EndoTAG -1 lower doses might be as 
effective as higher doses with probably less side effects, especially when combined 
with standard chemotherapy. This assumption was confirmed with an exploratory analyses of CT 4001 study ( A Controlled, Randomized, Open label Phase II Trial to 
Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of a 1st line Combination Treatment with Weekly Infusion of Gemcitabine and Twice Weekly Administration of Lipid Complexed Paclitaxel (EndoTAG- 1) in Three Dose Levels Compared with Gemcitabine Monotherapy in 
Patients with Measurable Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas ) with focus on a subpopulation of subjects with baseline ECOG grade of 0 
and 1. The results from the analyses demonstrated that hazard ratios (for PFS and OS) favor combination therapy of gemcitabine plus the EndoTAG -1 (for all three doses; 11 
mg/m², 22 mg/m² and 44 mg/m²) when compared to the gemcitabine monotherapy. However statistically significant differences were observed for the two endpoints (OS and PFS) between the gemcitabine monotherapy and EndoTAG -1 (22 mg/m²)  plus 
gemcitabine.   
Based on the results of exploratory analyses of CT 4001 study, EndoTAG -1 (22 mg/m² 
lipid complexed paclitaxel) dose is selected for this Phase 3 study.

6.6.1 Preparation of EndoTAG-1 and i.v. administration 
EndoTAG- 1 is delivered to the hospital pharmacy as a sterile, white powder for infusion 
(Lyophilisate) packaged in glass vials for single use. Until administration to the subject  
the investigational medicinal product has to be stored at 2- 8°C, protected from light. 
The hospital  pharmacy has to take care of the disposal of used vials and materials in 
contact with the  study medication in compliance to the local regulations concerning 
hazardous (cytotoxic) waste.  
The stability of the reconstituted drug in the vial as the primary container system is 24 
hours when stored at 25°C ± 2°C.  
Prior to application, EndoTAG-1 has to be reconstituted with water for injection under aseptic conditions using a safety work bench for cytostatics or similar safety measures 
at the  pharmacy.  After transfer of the reconstituted drug to the infusion system, it is 
stable for a maximum of 4 hours. 
The solution is allowed to rest undisturbed at 2- 8°C to allow complete reconstitution. 
The required application volume is calculated from the subject 's body weight and the 
dose schedule. A sufficient number of reconstituted vials have to be prepared to cover 
the application volume. For large application volumes, the preparation is split into 
portions, which can be used one after the other and stored at 2- 8°C until needed. The 
maximum volume for  one portion should not exceed 200 ml to allow the administration 
within the time frame of 4  hours and ensure in- use stability throughout the application. 
The maximum infusion rate  must not exceed 90 mL /hour = 1.5 mL/min and at the 
beginning of intravenous infusion the  rate should be accelerat ed slowly from 0.5 
mL/min to 1.5 mL/min over a period of 30 min. The investigational medicinal product 
must not be stored and used a second time. 
After randomization and before start of treatment phase it can be considered to apply a 
central venous catheter to the subject s (if not already present) to facilitate 
administration of  study medication.  
The investigator or pharmacist must maintain accurate records of the receipt of all  
investigational medicinal product provided by the sponsor, including date recei ved, 
batch  number, expiration date, subject  number, amount received and disposition 
(dispensation date, amount of investigational medicinal product dispensed and subject  
identification  number). 
All remaining unused investigational medicinal product has to be returned to the supplier after study termination or destroyed at the site's pharmacy after the written 
permission of the  sponsor according to standard operating procedures. Destruction of 
investigational medicinal product has to be documented by the investigator and/or 
pharmacist. The respective documentation has to be sent to the Sponsor. 
  Protocol No: CT 4006

 Confidential   Page 73 of 125 The pharmacist and the investigator have to follow the detailed information on 
preparation  and administration of EndoTAG -1 provided by the sponsor in a separate 
document. 
6.6.2 Preparation of gemcitabine and i.v. administration 
The investigational sites have to buy the gemcitabine supply locally. Associated costs 
will be reimbursed by  the sponsor. 
For reconstitution of the lyophilized gemcitabine please follow these instructions: 
• Calculate the amount of gemcitabine needed for administration of 1000 mg/m2. 
• To reconstitute, add 25 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to each required 1 g 
vial or 5 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to each required 200 mg vial. 
• Shake to dissolve. These dilutions each yield a gemcitabine concentration of 38 
mg/ml. The total volume upon reconstitution will be 5.26 ml or 26.3 m l, 
respectively.  
• Complete withdrawal of the vial contents will provide 200 mg or 1 g of gemcitabine,  
respectively.  
• Check that the solution is free from visible particles and that it is clear and colorless 
to light straw -colored.  
• Transfer the appropriate amount of reconstituted gemcitabine to an infusion bag. The drug may be administered as prepared or further diluted with 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection to concentrations as low as 0.1 mg/ml. 
• Administer the gemcitabine solution as an intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes.  
• Chemical and physical in -use stability of gemcitabine solution has been 
demonstrated  for 24 hours at 30°C. From a microbiological point of view, the 
product should be  used immediately. If not used immediately, in -use storage times 
and conditions prior  to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not 
be longer than 24 hours at room  temperature. Gemcitabine solution must not be 
stored cold, as precipitation may occur.  
6.7 Dose adjustments  
At the visit of a first infusion (Arm A: Visit 1, Arm B: Visit 1 G), the subject  has to 
receive 100% of the trial medication (A rm A: EndoTAG -1 and gemci tabine ; Arm B: 
gemcitabine).  If, for any reason it is clear that the subject  will not be able to receive the 
full dose of trial  medication at the first infusion, the treatment should not be initiated 
and the subject  should be immediately withdrawn from the  study.  
Important: For the purpose of dose adjustments due to clinical chemistry results 
(non -hematological toxicity) only basic parameters that can be analyzed without 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 74 of 125 longer waiting times (so called "emergency lab values") will be considered. These 
values are: A ST, AL T and creatinine. The remainder of clinical chemistry will be 
assessed for safety issues, but not considered for the decision of dose adjustment.  
In case of hematological, non- hematological and special hematological toxicities, 
treatment  might be reduced or postponed (during continuation of treatment: reduced or 
omitted) as  specified in the following. In case of postponement, all examinations of the 
respective visit  will be repeated one week later and study medication will be 
administered  according to the specifications given in  Section 6.7.1 and 6.7.2. 
6.7.1 Dose Modifications for EndoTAG-1 
Criteria for Dose Modifications  
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 7 or more days 
• Febrile neutropenia 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with significant bleeding or requiring transfusion 
• Grade ≥ 3 stomatitis/vomiting/diarrhea  
• Other ≥ Grade 3 and 4 toxicities a, b 
a Except Grade 3 fatigue/asthenia or transient arthralgia/myalgia for which no dose 
modification is required. 
b To be adjusted as medically indicated after discussion between Investigator and 
Sponsor 
If any of the above mentioned toxicity criteria are present, no study medication is to be 
administered at this visit. If the toxicity criteria are no longer fulfilled at the next scheduled visit, EndoTAG -1 is to be administered at a reduced dose of 11 mg/m². If the 
subject tolerates treatment at the reduced dose (i.e. does not develop any of the above mentioned toxicities), the EndoTAG -1 dose should be re -escalated to 22 mg/m². If re -
escalation is not tolerated by the subject, the d ose is to be permanently reduced to 11 
mg/m². The attempt for re -escalation of the EndoTAG -1 dose is to be made only once 
throughout the study. Subjects not tolerating treatment even after dose reduction will 
be taken off study.

6.7.2.2 Dose Modifications for Non- Hematologic Adverse Reactions  
Permanently discontinue Gemcitabine  for any of the following:  
• Unexplained dyspnea or other evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity  
• Severe hepatic toxicity  
• Hemolytic -uremic syndrome  
• Capillary leak syndrome  
• Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome  
Note: Withhold gemcitabine  or reduce dose by 50% for other severe (Grade 3 or 4) 
non-hematological toxicity until resolved. No dose modifications are recommended for 
alopecia, nausea, or vomiting. 
If a subject fails to meet criteria for retreatment on the day the next treatment is 
scheduled, treatment should be omitted and the subject will be re -evaluated at least 
weekly. Treatment may be omitted for a maximum of 2 weeks. If treatment is omitted for >1 week, a new cycle should be started upon continuation of treatment. Any subject who fails to recover from a treatment related adverse event to baseline or Grade 2  
within 2 weeks of scheduled retreatment will be withdrawn from the study with the exception of subjects who benefit from study treatment (non -progressive disease 
according t o RECIST v.1.1), who may continue treatment on study after consultation 
and approval of the Sponsor. 
6.7.3 Dose Modification for Subjects A ssigned to Arm A (EndoTAG -1 plus 
Gemcitabine)  
Subjects may start a new cycle of combination therapy if ANC is > 1,500/mm
3, platelets 
are >100,000/mm3 and treatment -related non -hematologic adverse event including 
neuropathy has resolved to baseline or Grade 2. Subject s with Grade 2 neuropathy will 
not be retreated until resolved to Grade 1. 
Note:  Subjects on treatment arm A who  requires discontinuation of g emcitabine will 
not continue on single -agent EndoTAG -1 alone. However, subjects in Treatment Arm 
A who require discontinuation of EndoTAG -1 due to toxicity may continue on 
gemcitabine monotherapy. Subjects on Arm B ( gemcitabin e alone) will not be offered 
treatment with EndoTAG -1 at the time of discontinuation (no cross- over allowed).  
6.8 Contraindications, Precautions, and Warnings for EndoTAG-1 
6.8.1 Contraindications 
EndoTAG- 1 is contraindicated in patients with known severe hypersensi tivity to 
paclitaxel  or to any excipients.  
EndoTAG-1 should not be used in patients with baseline neutrophils < 1,000/mm3. 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 76 of 125 There is no experience of the use of EndoTAG -1 in pregnant women. Like other 
cytotoxic  anticancer drugs, EndoTAG -1 could cause fetal harm when administered to 
a pregnant  woman and, therefore, is contraindicated during pregnancy. Women of 
childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while they or their male 
partner are receiving  EndoTAG -1 and in the 90 days  following discontinuation of 
EndoTAG- 1 therapy.  Should they become pregnant after all, they should inform the 
treating doctor immediately.  
It is not known whether EndoTAG -1 is excreted in human milk. EndoTAG -1 is 
contraindicated in nursing mothers. It is recommended that nursing be discontinued when  receiving EndoTAG- 1 therapy.  
6.8.2 Precautions and Warnings 
Sometimes infusion associated reactions may occur within minutes of starting the infusion of  EndoTAG- 1. These are characterized by symptoms including dyspnea, 
flushing, chest  pain, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, shortness of breath, chills, 
back pain, tightness in chest and throat as well as hypotension. Temporarily stopping 
the infusion usually resolves  these symptoms without further therapy. However, 
medication to treat these symptoms (e.g.  antihistamines, corticosteroids, 
catecholamines, see below) as well as emergency equipment  should be available for 
immediate use. In most patients ’ treatment can be resumed after all  symptoms have 
resolved, without recurrence. To minimize the risk of infusion reactions, the  infusion 
has to be started slowly and infusion rate should not exceed 1.5ml/min. The patient  
should be carefully monitored during infusion. 
Please follow the local procedures for handling of cytotoxic drugs. EndoTAG- 1 contains the cytotoxic drug paclitaxel and, as with other potentially toxic  
compounds, caution should be exercised in handling EndoTAG -1. The use of gloves is  
recommended. If EndoTAG -1 solution contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately 
and thoroughl y with soap and water. If EndoTAG -1 contacts mucous membranes, the  
membranes should be flushed immediately and thoroughly with water. Any unused product and all equipment used for the preparation and administration of  
EndoTAG- 1 or contacting EndoTAG -1 must  be disposed of in accordance with local  
requirements concerning cytotoxic drug products. 
6.8.3 Emergency Medication for infusion related toxicity  
• H2-receptor antagonist (e.g. cimetidine 300 mg i.v. or ranitidine 50 mg i.v.) 
• H1-antihistaminic (e.g. clemastine 2mg i. v.) 
together with other "state -of-the- art" emergency medications (e.g. corticoids,  
catecholamines) have to be kept handy on site.

  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 77 of 125 For c ontraindications, precautions, and warnings , refer to  SPC of gemcitabine  in details.  
 
Concomitant radiotherapy 
Concomitant radiotherapy (given together or ≤7 days apart): Toxicity associated with 
this multimodality therapy is dependent on many different factors, including dose of gemcitabine, frequency of gemcitabine administration, dose of radiation, radiotherapy planning technique, the target tissue, and target volume. Details and recommendations 
for use can refer to SPC of gemcitabine. 
 Live vaccinations  
Yellow fever vaccine and other live attenuated vaccines are not recommended in 
patients treated with gemcitabine due to the risk of systemic, possibly fatal, disease, 
particularly in immunosuppressed patients. 
 Fertility  
Men being treated with gemcitabine are advised not to father a child during and up to  
6 months after treatment and to seek further advice regarding cryoconservation of 
sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of infertility due to therapy with gemcitabine. 
6.10 Other study medication  
No other study medication is allowed while the subject  is participating in the trial.  
6.11 Prior and Concomitant Medication  
6.11.1 Prior Treatment  
Patients are not allowed to have received any chemotherapeutical treatment ( except 
FOLFIRINOX  as the first -line therapy) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma prior to 
enrollme nt. 
6.11.2 Permitted Treatment  
Premedication : 
In arm A group, Dexamethasone and anti -histamine drugs such as diphenhydramine (or 
its equivalent), cimetidine or ranitidine may be given as premedication for EndoTAG -
1 (liposomal paclitaxel).  
Paclitaxel -induced nause a an d vomiting may be prevented by i.v. application of 
ondansetron (8 mg), granisetron (3 mg), tropisetron (4 mg) or dolasetron (100 mg) 
given 30 min prior to chemotherapy. Delayed nausea and vomiting may be treated with oral metoclopramide and dexamethasone.  
G-CSF or GM -CSF:  
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 78 of 125 In case of o bserved severe hematotoxicity (i.e., maximal hematotoxicity with 
granulocytes < 0.5/µl or granulocytes < 1.0/ µl possibly accompanied by fever> 38.5° 
C, or hematotoxicity necessitating treatment delay), colony -stimulating factors should 
be given prophylactically starting on day 2 of the following cycles until recovery to 
prevent further episodes of hematotoxicity. 
Note:  The met abolism of paclitaxel is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Caution should be exercised when paclitaxel  is 
concomitantly administered with known substrates (e .g., midazolam, buspirone, 
felodipine, lovastatin, eletriptan, sildenafil, simvastatin, and tri azolam), inhibitors 
(e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and telithromycin), and inducers (eg, rifampin and carbamazepine) of CYP3A4.  
Caution should also be exercised when paclitaxel  is concomitantly administered with 
known substrates (eg, repaglinide and rosiglitazone), inhibitors (eg, gemfibrozil), and inducers (e.g., rifampin) of CYP2C8.  
Potential interactions between paclitaxel , a substrate of CYP3A4, and protease 
inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir), which are substrates 
and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4, have not been evaluated in clinical trials.

The EORTC -QLQ -C30 [European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
Quality of Life Questionnaire], and PAN- 26 module, whi ch was  specifically developed 
for clinical trials in pancreatic cancer, will be used to evaluate  clinical benefit.  
7.13 Tumor Imaging 
Abdominal CT -scan with i.v. and gastrointestinal contrasts (or MRI), and chest X -ray 
(or CT or MRI). Thoracic CT - or MRI -scans have to be done additionally, if target 
lesions detected by chest X -ray are not clearly defined or not surrounded by aerated 
lung. Further imaging exams to be done if lesions are suspected in other areas. 
7.14 Tumor Response Evaluation 
7.14.1 Definition of lesions  
Tum or response will be assessed according to the RECIST ( version 1.1; Eisenhauer et 
al. 2009) . At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or 
non-measurable as follows:  
7.14.1.1 Measurable 
Tumor lesions : Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is  to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
• 10mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than  5mm).  
• 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be 
accurately measur ed with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable).  
• 20mm by chest X- ray. 
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and me asurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15mm in  short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow- up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
7.14.1.2 Non-measurable 
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter  < 10mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15mm  short axis) as well as truly non -measurable lesions. 
Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: leptomeningeal disease,  ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement 
of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by  physical 
exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging  techniques.  
7.14.1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability 
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particula r comment: 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 84 of 125 Bone lesions:  
• Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques 
to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. 
• Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferre d 
for selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
• Tumour lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco- regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated  progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the 
conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable. 
7.14.2 Method of Assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique have to be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at screening, at end of treatment and during follow-up. 
Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). 
Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of 5 mm or less 
in slice thickness, if possible [minimum measurable lesion size: long axis  ≥ 10 mm (CT 
+ MRI) and 2 x slice thickness, if the slice thickness is > 5 mm].  
Ultrasound may only be used as a possible alternative to clinical measurements for superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules.

  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 85 of 125 7.14.3 Baseline docum entation of ‘target’ and ‘non -target’ lesions  
Only subjects with measurable disease at baseline should be enrolled in this study. For 
evaluation of tumor response, lesions present at screening will be separated into target and non-target lesions according to the following criteria:  
Target Lesions : 
• A maximum of five (5) target lesions in total (up to two (2) per organ)  
• Select largest reproducibly measurable lesions. If the largest lesion cannot be measured reproducibly, select the next largest lesion which can be measured   
• Add up longest diameters (LD) of non- nodal lesions (axial plane) and short axis 
diameters of nodes. This is the “sum of the longest diameters” (SLD) 
Non-Target Lesions  
• All other lesions present at screening. Measurements of these lesions  are not 
required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -
up. 
• It is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a 
single item on the eCRF (e.g. “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”)  
7.14.4 Evaluation of target lesions 
• Measure LD (axial plane) for each target lesion  
• Measure short axis for target lymph nodes  
• Add these measurements to get the SLD  
• If too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm is assigned. If the lesion disappears 
completely, the measurement is recorded as 0 mm.  
• Splitting or coalescent lesions  
o If a target lesion fragments into multiple smaller lesions, the LDs of all 
fragmented p ortions are added to the sum  
o If target lesions coalesce, the LD of the resulting coalescent lesion is added to the sum

be documented: 
• Medication/treatment name (generic name may be used if trade name is unknown) 
• Dose, unit, and frequency of dosing (individual dosages, not total daily dose).  
o Note:  Each new dose of medication should be recorded as a separate 
entry, with the exception of medications that are given on a sliding scale. 
For these, it is acceptable to enter the range of the dosage, including the start and stop dates for which the specified dosage range was used. 
• Route of dosing 
• Indication for use 
• The start date

7.17 Randomization 
Subjects who are eligible to participate in the trial will be centrally randomized to 
receive either Arm A (EndoTAG -1 and gemcitabine) or Arm B (gemcitabine alone) in 
a 1:1 ra tio using a stratified block randomization scheme. The stratification variables 
are the extent of disease (subjects with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer) and the performance status (ECOG performance status 0 and 1). Within each stratum, subjects will be allocated with equal probability to either treatment in Arm A or treatment in Arm B and the randomization system will be set up in such a way that there is a 1:1 balance between the treatment groups from the different strata.  
7.18 Study Treatment Administration  
Refer to Section 6 for details.  
7.19 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The measurements used in this in study are considered appropriate for the indication studied. Disease response is a common tool used in cancer trials to study the effectiveness of the study drug. Safety and tolerability of the study drug will be reported during the trial.

  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 89 of 125 8 Adverse Events  Definitions and Repor ting 
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting 
the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol. During the study when there is a safety evaluation, the Investigator or site staff will be  responsible 
for detecting, documenting and reporting AEs and SAEs as detailed in this Section of the protocol.  
8.1 Adverse Events  (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject  administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of an IP, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product (definition per ICH E2A and E6 R1). 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study therapy, 
must be recorded using medical termi nology on the AE eCRF page. Whenever possible, 
diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respiratory infection”). All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to Sponsor instructions. 
AEs will be elicited through direct questioning and subject reports. Any abnormality in 
physical examination findings or laboratory res ults that the investigator believes is 
clinically significant to the research subject and that occurred after initiation of the first study treatment will be reported as AEs. Abnormal findings that are NOT clinically significant should not be recorded as a n AE.  
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to both determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (see Section on SAEs) requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated representative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be 
obtained by the Investigator to determine the causality of the AE. 
Interventions for pre -treatment conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study enrolment are not considered AE. Laboratory results, which are out of range at the screening assessment (up to 14 days 
prior to randomization) do not fulfill the definition of an AE since these results 
represent the baseline inf ormation. 
Progression of the disease under investigation as well as an increase in CA19- 9 values 
will not be regarded as adverse event during the course of this trial. Death due to disease  
progression has to be reported to the sponsor via the "Death due to Disease Progression"  
form.  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 90 of 125 8.1.1 Impact on Study Treatment  
The impact the event had on the study treatment will be assessed as either: none, study 
treatment interrupted, study treatment discontinued, or not applicable. The “not applicable” assessment will be us ed only when the subject is no longer in the treatment 
phase of the protocol or died. 
8.1.2 Intensity Assessment  
The severity of the AE will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) Grading Scale Version 4.03 (Publish Date: June 14, 2010, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html).  
The maximum severity (intensity) of the AE will be categorized by the Investigator as follows: 
Table 8-1:  CTCAE v4.03 General Guidelines 
Grade  Description  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL†.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.‡  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
†Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 
‡Unlike the AE outcome assessmen t (see section 8.1.5 ), a su bject  may have more than one Grade 5 event. 
 
-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v4.03: June 14, 2010 
For AEs not covered b y NCI CTCAE, the  seve rity will be cha racterized as “mild,” 
“mode rate,” or “seve re” a ccordin g to the foll owing  definitions: 
• Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities  
• Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject  
and may interfere with daily activities  
• Severe events interrupt the subject ’s usual daily activities.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the 
maximum intensity for the experience should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separat ely (with distinct 
onset dates). All AEs, due to any cause that occurs during the investigation, whether or not related to the study drug, should be reported to the Safety Coordinator. 
  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 91 of 125 8.1.3 Causality Assessment  
The investigator will assign a relationship to the study drug (i.e. causality) for all AEs 
that occur during the study using the definitions below:  
• Unrelated:  The AE is clearly related to other causes such as participant’s clinical 
state, environmental factors, or other therapies administered. 
• Unlikely to be related:  The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from study drug administration; could readily have been produced by other causes such as the participant’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other therapies administered; does not follow a known response pattern to the study drug.  
• Possibly related:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug 
administration; follows a known response pattern to the study drug; could readily have been produced by other causes such a s the participant’s clinical state, 
environmental factors, or other therapies administered.  
• Probably related:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study 
drug administration; follows a known response pattern to the study drug; cannot be reaso nably explained by other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, 
environmental factors, or other therapies administered; improvement upon cessation of test drug.  
• Definitely related:  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study 
drug a dministration; follows a known response pattern to the study drug; cannot be 
reasonably explained by other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, environmental factors, or other therapies administered; improvement upon cessation of test drug or reappears upon repeat exposure (if rechallenge occurs).  
8.1.4 Treatment Given as a Result of the Event  
The event impact in terms of treatment provided will be as either: none, medication administered, non- drug therapy administered, surgery performed, hospitalization, or 
other (with a specification).  
8.1.5 Outcome Assessment  
The outcome of the event will be assessed as either: resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing, or death. Only one AE per subject is allowed to have an outcome assessment as “death.” If there are multiple causes of death for a given subject, only the primary 
cause of death will have an outcome of death. 
8.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs occurring during the study (from the time of the first study treatment until 
28 days after the last dose of study t reatment) observed by the Investigator or reported 
by the subject (whether or not attributed to study drug), will be reported on the e CRF. 
Clinically significant AEs considered related or non- related to the IP by the Investigator 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 92 of 125 or the Sponsor will be followed until resolved or considered stable by the Investigator . 
The following information must be provided:  description; dates of onset and resolution; 
severity; assessment of relatedness to IP;  whether treatment was given as a result of the 
event  and the outcome of the event. The investigator may be asked to provide follow -
up information. 
All AEs, serious or not, that result in the subject ’s permanent withdrawal of IP or from 
the study will be discussed between the investigator and medical monitor. The e CRF  
for EOT /Early Withdrawal Visit should be completed including reason of withdrawal. 
It will be the investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an AE is of sufficient 
severity to require the subject ’s removal from study treatment. A subject may also 
voluntarily withdraw from study treatment due to what he or she perceives as an 
intolerable AE. If either of these occurs, the subject  must undergo EOT assessment and 
be given appropriate care under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition be comes stable.  
8.3 Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (ICH E2A and 
E6 R1):  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
This means that the subject  is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization, based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered 
SAEs if the y are thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining a SAE. 
Since SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety problems, 
it is important to take into a ccount both the Investigator’s and the sponsor’s assessment. 
If either the sponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting. 
All SAEs must be reported to the sponsor or sponsor designee immediately after the 
Investigator becomes aware of the event, along with a determination as to whether it is associated with the IP or any other study procedure. 
Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE or SAE term; instead, signs and 
symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression will be reported if they fulfil l the SAE definition.  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 93 of 125 8.4 Serious Adverse Event Reporting

Investigator knowledge of the event to Covance Patient Safety Services  within 24 hours.  
CRO Covance  Covance Patient Safety Services  
Email:      SAEIntake@covance.com  
Fax:          + 1-888-887-8097 
Phone:     +61 -2-88792000 (SAE hotline) 
A written SAE reports must include a full description of the event as described in 
Section  8.1 The Medical Monitor may  request additional supporting documentation as 
it becomes available, such as lab reports, electrocardiogram [ECG] reports, discharge summary, hospital notes, etc, if applicable.  
Relevant medical records should be provided to the Sponsor or CRO as soon as  they 
become available; autopsy reports should be provided for deaths if available. Should an 
Investigator be made aware of an SAE occurring any time after the reporting period, it must be promptly reported.  
The Investigator is also responsible for reporting all SAEs to the appropriate 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with local laws and regulations. The Investigator is responsible for maintaining documentation in the study file that indicates the IRB has been properly notified.  
All SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study, or that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject 's participation in the study, must be followed until any of 
the following occurs:  
• The event resolves.   
• The event stabilizes.  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available.  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the IP or to factors unrelated to 
study conduct.  
• It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained ( subject  or 
health care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up 
after demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts).  
 
8.5 SAE Follow- Up 
All subjects experiencing an SAE, including the discontinued subjects, must be closely 
followed until sufficient information is obtained to indicate a return to normal status or until the event stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator (i.e., recovery, return to baseline status, no further improvement expected, or death).  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 94 of 125 For each SAE indicated as an unresolved event on the initial report, regardless of 
whether the subject completed the study or withdrew, the site should submit a follow -
up report with updated information. 
8.6 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactio ns (SUSAR)  
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event or adverse experience for which 
there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the adverse event. Inherent in this definition, and in the requirement to report them, is the need for the sponsor to evaluate the available evidence and make a judgment about the likelihood that the drug actually caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the adverse event.  
Unexpected  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity tha t has 
been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepati c 
necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  
8.7 Expedited Reporting of SUSAR  
Sponsor (or designee) will provide written notification to the regulatory agencies i.e. FDA and all participating investigators of any suspected adver se reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected. Each notification should be submitted as specified below, depending on the type of event. Each written notification may be submitted on FDA form 3500A and/or CIOMS- I. 
• 7-Day Expedited Report: any serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction 
that is fatal or life -threatening will be reported as soon as possible and no later than 
7 calendar days after the sponsor’s (or designee’s) initial receipt of the information. 
• 15-Day Expedited Report: any serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction 
that is not fatal or life -threatening will be reported as soon as possible and no later 
than 15 calendar days after the sponsor (or designee) determines that the event qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 312.32). 
8.8 Pregnancies  
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 95 of 125 All initial reports of pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the 
Investigator knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy form.  
For IP, an exposure during pregnancy occurs if:  
• A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
directly exposed (e.g., environmental exposure) to the IP, or the female becomes, 
or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being directly exposed to the IP (m aternal exposure) for 28 days after last dose of or exposure to IP.  
• A male partner of a pregnant female has been exposed to the IP, either due to 
treatment or environmental exposure, within 3 months prior to the time of 
conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure).  
If any study subject  or study subject ’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during 
the study subject ’s treatment with the IP or exposure as defined above, the Investigator 
must submit this information on a Pregnancy form to the Sponsor (or its designated representative). In addition, the Investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to an IP in a pregnant woman (e.g., a subject  reports that she 
is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) using the Pregnancy form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see following information related to induced termination of pregnancy). 
Follow- up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all exposure  
during pregnancy reports with an unknown outcome. The Investigator will follow the 
pregnancy until completion or until pregnancy termination (e.g., induced abortion) and then notify the Sponsor or its designated representative of the outcome as a follow -up 
to the initial Pregnancy form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the st ructural integrity of 
the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre -procedure 
test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported).  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an 
SAE (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in a live born, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the In vestigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting SAEs.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAEs follows:  
• “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and abortion.  
• All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without 
regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be

exposure to IP.  
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by the Investigator. Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and 
any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required.

Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v.1.1) 
• Percentage of subjects with objective response is based on assessment of complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST v.1.1. 
• Duration of Response (DR) 
• Duration of Response is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (date of the first CR or PR) to objective tumor 
progression or death due to any cause.

 Confidential   Page 98 of 125 • Percentage of subjects with disease control is based on assessment of complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to 
RECIST v.1.1 
• Serum Carcinoma Antigen 19-9 (CA 19- 9) response rate  
• Responders are defined as subjects with a reduction in CA 19- 9 levels by least 
50% from baseline to the end of cycle 1 (or end of full treatment course). 
9.2.2 Safety Assessments 
Safety will be assessed based on the following assessments:  
• Incidence and severity of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including 
serious adverse events and adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of protocol- defined therapy.  
• Changes in selected laboratory test results (i.e.,  
o Serum chemistry including urea, serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, bilirubin, albumin, ALT, AST, ALP, total protein; and  
o Full blood count (FBC) including hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count, Platelets count, total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count and absolute neutrophil count)  
• Changes in vital signs including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse  
• Changes in electrocardiogram ( ECG) results  
• Changes in physical examination results  
9.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints 
• Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer, Quality of Life Questionnaire Core -30 (EORTC QLQ - C30) Score  
EORTC QLQ- C30: included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, 
and social), global health status (GHS), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, 
nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Most  questions used 4- point scale 
(1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used 7- point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 
'Excellent'). Scores averaged, transformed to 0- 100 scale; higher score=better 
level of functioning or greater degree of symptoms. Change from baseline=Cycle/Day score minus baseline score.  
• Change from baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire- Pancreatic 26 (EORTC QLQ - PAN26) Score  
QLQ-PAN26 consists of 26 questions (Qs) relating to disease symptoms, treatment 
(Tx) side effects and emotional issues specific to pancreatic cancer (PC). Questions include on altered bowel habits, pain, dietary changes, disease and Tx -related 
symptoms and issues related to the emotional and social well-being of participants

to 4='very much' and subsequently transformed into scales that range from 0-100; 
higher scores= greater degree of symptoms or treatment side effects and emotional issues.  
 
9.3 Sample Size Determination and Rationale  
A total of 218 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A 
(EndoTAG-1 plus gemcitabine) and Arm B (gemcitabine monotherapy).  
The sample size is event -driven to collect a pre -specified number of primary efficacy 
outcomes. Based on the sample size calculation, the primary endpoint analysis for 
overall survival will require 16 7 events (deaths)  from the 196 subjects . The primary 
endpoint analysis for progression- free survival will  require 169 events (disease 
progression) from 182 subjects. This sample size is sufficient to detect a 40% reduction  
of overall survival  in the risk of death in Arm A, as compared with Arm B (hazard ratio, 
0.60) using a 2- sided log- rank test with 90% powe r and an overall significance level of 
0.05 two sided test. This sample size is also sufficient to detect a 35% reduction o f 
progression free survival in the risk of disease progression in Arm A, as compared with Arm B (hazard ratio, 0.647) using a 2- sided  log- rank test with more than 80% power 
and an overall significance level of 0.05 two sided test. Sample size estimation  for 
overall survival is depicted in  Figure 9-1, total sample size requirement vs. the median 
survival time (month) in the treatment arm. Sample size is estimated using PASS (15) sample size software.  
Sample size estimation for progression- free survival is depicted in Figure 9-2, total 
sample size requirement vs. the median survival time (month) in the treatment arm. Sample size is estimated using PASS (1 5) sample size software.  
It is anticipated that there would be about 10% dropout in this study, to accommodate 
for the dropouts a total of 218 subjects would be randomized.  
The overall survival assumption for the sample size are based on published literature 
data comparing therapeutic effect of gemcitabine  monotherapy and gemcitabine 
combination regimen on patients with advanced pancreatic cancer after previous FOLFIRINOX treatment. The hazard ratio for death of 0.60 w ith median overall 
survival of 4.4 months for gemcitabine monotherapy (Conroy et al. 2011) and 7.3 
months for gemcitabine + paclitaxel combination (Portal et al. 2015) was used for the 
sample size calculation.  The progression- free survival assumption for t he sample size 
are based on hazard ratio of 0.647 with median progression- free survival of 3.3 months 
for gemcitabine monotherapy (Conroy et al. 2011) and 5.1 months for gemcitabine + paclitaxel combination (Portal et al. 2015) was used for the sample size calculation.

9.4 Randomization and Stratification  

  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 101 of 125 This study will be conducted at approximate ly up to 100 sites. A total of 218 subjects 
are planned to be enrolled. All eligible subjects will be centrally randomized to receive 
either Arm A (EndoTAG -1 and gemcitabine) or Arm B (gemcitabine alone) in a 1:1 
ratio using a stratified block randomization scheme. The stratification variables are the extent of disease (subjects with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer) and the performance status (ECOG performance status 0 and 1). Within each stratum, subjects will be allocated with equal probability to  either treatment in Arm A or 
treatment in Arm B and the randomization system will be set up in such a way that there is a 1:1 balance between the treatment groups from the different strata.  
9.5 Blinding  
As this is an open label study, all study personnel will have knowledge of the treatment assignments after randomization and throughout the study. To avoid any susceptible selection bias, a stratified block randomization scheme with a mixed block size will  be 
used and the blocks will be blinded until trial closure to all research personnel except the block generating statistician. The master randomization lists containing the treatment assignments will not be released to any study personnel prior to final d atabase 
lock except for the DSMB meetings and at the time of the interim analysis.  
 
9.6 Interim Analysis  
A single, pre -planned Interim Analysis (IA) will be conducted when approximately 101 
subjects have died (60% of the expected 167 events  for the overall survival primary 
endpoint ). 
The procedures for this IA will be based on a standard operating procedure (SOP) that 
has a well -established a firewall to protect the integrity of the trial. The IA will be 
performed by an independent statistician, who is not ot herwise associated with the 
conduct of this trial. Details of the firewall will be outlined in the SOP.  
The results of the IA will be reviewed by an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board  (DSM B) who would assess the data for both safety (for the purp oses of 
continuing the trial) and efficacy  (for the purposes of sample size re -estimation) . The 
DSM B responsibilities will be further elaborated in the DSM B charter.  The DSM B will 
approve continuation of the study and recommend the sample size for remainde r of the 
study.  
Goals:   
The objectives of this interim analysis are: 
• To evaluate the safety and efficacy of EndoT AG-1 plus gemcitabine in 
prolonging Overall Survival  (OS) and Progression Free Survival  (PFS) of 
subjects with locally advanced and/or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas eligible for second- line therapy after failing first- line therapy with 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 102 of 125 FOLFIRINOX.  
• Determine if it is necessary  to evaluate the original sample size assumptions and 
to ma intain study power. 
9.6.1 Metrics to be Calculated for the Interim Analysis  
9.6.1.1 Data for Safety Review  
At the time of the interim safety data review, all the data to be used along with the 
treatment assignment of each randomized subject will be given to the independent statistician. Using this data, the independent statistician will prepare descriptive summary and by subject listings of baseline and safety data including demographics, adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory findings, physical examinations, vital 
signs, and ECG.   
9.6.1.2 Data for Efficacy Interim Analysis based on Overall Survival  (OS) and 
Progression Free Survival  (PFS) 
At the time of Interim Analysis, all the data to be used in the interim analysis along 
with the treatment assignment of each randomized subject will be given to the independent statistician. Using this data, the independent statistician will calculate the following metrics in addition to all the safety data that is to be prepared for the safety review:  
1. 
For the calculation of the conditional power: 
a. Proportion of subjects randomized to each Arm at the time of interim analysis  
b. The test statistic computed from the observed data using Cox proportional hazards 
model outlined in the Primary Efficacy Analysis as described in Section 9.8.3.1.  
c. The number of events at the time of the interim analysis  
2. For the re -estimation of the sample size, if necessary per Section 9.6.2:  
a. The median overall  survival (OS) and  median  progression free  survival ( PFS) in Arm 
A and the observed number of subjects in the group, calculated using the Kaplan- Meier 
method, in months 
b. The median overall survival (OS) and  median progression free   (PFS) in Arm B and 
the observed number of subjects in the group, calculated using the Kaplan- Meier 
method, in months 
3. The Conditional Power (CP) of the trial at the time of the IA based on items 1a. – 1c. and 
the formula provided below  for both OS and PFS. 
 
Conditional Power (CP) using Differences in Overall  S urvival and  Progression 
Free  Survival 
The CP will be calculated  for each primary endpoint (i.e., OS and PFS)  according to 
the formula [Jenninson and Turnbull (2000) pages 205 to 208] per the metrics 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 103 of 125 calculated above using the formula:   
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑘𝑘(𝜃𝜃)=  𝛷𝛷�𝑍𝑍𝑘𝑘�𝐼𝐼𝑘𝑘−𝑧𝑧1−𝛼𝛼 /2�𝐼𝐼𝐾𝐾+𝜃𝜃(𝐼𝐼𝐾𝐾−𝐼𝐼𝑘𝑘)
�𝐼𝐼𝐾𝐾−𝐼𝐼𝑘𝑘�
+𝛷𝛷�−𝑍𝑍𝑘𝑘�𝐼𝐼𝑘𝑘−𝑧𝑧1−𝛼𝛼 /2�𝐼𝐼𝐾𝐾−𝜃𝜃(𝐼𝐼𝐾𝐾−𝐼𝐼𝑘𝑘)
�𝐼𝐼𝐾𝐾−𝐼𝐼𝑘𝑘� 
Where 
𝜃𝜃 =the observed treatment effect at t he time of the interim analysis  [log (HR)  
using OS and PFS data at the time of the IA ] and: 
k=an interim stage at which the conditional power is computed  
K=the stage at which the study is terminated and the final test is computed  
Zk=the logrank test statistic calculated from the observed data that has been 
collected up to stage k, [ 𝑆𝑆𝑘𝑘�𝐼𝐼𝑘𝑘�⁄ ], where S k is the logrank score statistic 
computed from the obser ved data]  
Ik=the information level at stage k; Ik= [Ek*Pc*(1-Pc); where E k is the number of 
events at stage k and P c is the proportion of subjects assigned to the control 
group (Arm B)]  
IK=the information level at the end of the study; IK= [E*P c*(1-Pc); where E is 
the total number of events and P c is the proportion of subjects assigned to the 
control group (Arm B)] Z
1-α=the standard normal value for the test with at type I error rate of α  
The resulting Conditional Power (CP) from the two primary endpoints will be used to 
determine whether the sample size needs to be increased or remains unchanged.  
9.6.2 Rules and Methods for Decisions at the Time of the IA  
The re -estimation of the sample size plan will be performed while preserving alpha 
according to Mehta and  Pocock (2010).  
The sample size for the study will be adjusted only if the Interim Analysis CP  for at 
least one of the primary endpoints OS or PFS is  less than 90%  and greater than 35%  
(i.e., if CP for at least one of the primary endpoints is  in the promi sing zone) . In the 
event that both the CP from OS and PFS are in the promising zone, the lower CP will 
be used for adjustment of the sample size. The adjustment would be an increase in the 
target number of events (i.e., deaths  or PD ) needed in the study in order to bring the CP 
to at least 90% up to a maximum increase of 4 36 subjects (218 per group), using the 
observed effect size at the time of the interim analysis.  
If and only if the interim analysis CP is less than 90% and greater than 35% then the sample size will be re -estimated up to 436 subjects by suing the PASS sample size 
calculation in Section 3.2. The sample size calculations will be performed under the same assumptions as the initial sample size calculations with the exception of inserting 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 104 of 125 the observed 1) hazard ratio  of OS and median overall survival  and 2) hazard ratio of 
PFS and median progression f ree survival in the treatment and control groups at the 
time of IA.       
The DSMB will make recommendations to sponsor on the continuation/modification/ 
termination and relevant comments based on the interim results.  
 
9.6.3 Rule and Method for Protection of Type I Error Rate  
Per the Mehta and Pocock (2010) paper, if one increases the sample size only when 
interim results are promising, a conventional hypothesis test can be performed without 
inflating the type -1 error.  By following the procedure of Mehta and Pocock (2010), if 
the conditional power at the interim analysis is greater than 35%, performing an unblinded IA and sample size re -estimation will not have an effect on alpha and the 
overall type I error at the end of the study will be preserved. The cutoff value of 33 % 
chosen based on the guidance from Mehta and Pocock (2010) with a maximum allowed re-estimation of two times the original sample size, an interim look when 60% of 
expected events occur, and a targeted conditional power of 90%.

 Confidential   Page 105 of 125 9.7.1 Analysis Populations  
9.7.1.1 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects randomized, regardless 
of actual treatment received . The ITT population will be the primary population for the  
analysis of primary and secondary endpoints.  
9.7.1.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population 
The Per Protocol (PP) population is defined as the set of subjects who meet the ITT 
population requirements, and were not associated with a major protocol violation. This population will be identified before the database lock.  
The PP analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will be considered supportive.  
9.7.1.3 Safety Population 
The Safety population is defined as any subject receiving the treatment after 
randomization. This population will be used for the analysis of safety parameters.  
9.7.2 Covariates  
In the efficacy analysis, the pre -specified stratification factors stated in Section 9.4 will 
be included in the model.  
9.7.3 Subgroups

For efficacy evaluation appropriate methods will be used to handle any missing data. 
The details of techniques for handling of missing data will be included in the SAP for the study which will be finalized prior to database lock.  
9.8 Analysis Methods  
A detailed SAP accompanies the protocol and any amendments to the SAP will be 
developed and approved before the database is locked. The SAP will present the 
detailed statistical methodology to be used in analyzing the efficacy and safety data 
from this trial.  
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 106 of 125 To maintain the trial- wise Type I error rate at 0.05, a hierarchical  test procedure  with 
fixed sequence will be used for the two primary endpoints and the secondary endpoint s. 
The order of the endpoints is outlined in Section 9.8.3.1.  Each subsequent endpoint 
will not be tested unless the previous endpoint analysis  in the hierarchy  has rejected the 
null hypothesis. If an analysis of an endpoint fails to reject the null hypothesis, then no 
further analyses will be performed. All endpoints, if tested, will use a two -sided analysis 
at an α=0.05 significance level. 
9.8.1 Subj ect Disposition  
The disposition of all subjects who sign an ICF will be provided. The numbers of 
subjects screened, randomized, completed, and discontinued during the study, as well as the reasons for all post -randomization discontinuations will be summar ized by 
treatment group, for all centers combined and each center separately. Disposition and reason for study discontinuation will also be provided as a by- subject listing.  
9.8.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristi cs will be summarized by treatment group 
using appropriate descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values by study treatment. Categorical variables will be summarized u sing frequency counts and 
percentages by study treatment. No inferential testing will be performed.  
9.8.3 Efficacy Analyses 
9.8.3.1 Primary Analysis  
The primary analysis will be conducted on the Intent -to-treat (ITT) population. PP 
population will be used for supportive analysis to show the robustness of the analysis. 
Primary Endpoint s:
  
To maintain the trial- wise Type I error rate at 0.05, a hierarchical test  procedure with 
fixed sequence will be used for the two primary  endpoints. The order of the endpoints 
will be as follows: 
1. Overall survival (OS) 
Overall survival time is defined as time from randomization to death from any cause 
or last day known to be alive. 
2. Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
Progression Free Survival time is defined as the time from randomization to either 
first observation of progressive disease or occurrence of death.  
 
 
  Protocol No: CT 4006 
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 107 of 125 OS  and PFS will be compared between the treatment groups using stratified log -rank 
test with the stratif ication factors  included in the model. The differences  for treatment 
effect and its 95% CI will be estimated.  
In addition, the Kaplan- Meier method will also be used to depict the median time to 
death from any cause for the treatment groups.  
Secondary Endpoints:  
Similarly, to maintain the trial- wise Type I error rate at 0.05, a hierarchical test  
procedure with fixed sequence  will be used for the secondary endpoints. The order of 
the endpoints will be as follows: 
1. Percentage of subjects with Objective Response (OR) according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v.1.1) 
2. Duration of Response (DR) 
3. Percentage of subjects with disease control according to RECIST v.1.1 
4. Serum Carcinoma Antigen 19-9 (CA 19- 9) response rate  
Analysis of the secondary endpoints will be summarized according to the variable type:  
• Continuous data summaries will include:  
o If the Normality assumption is met, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) or Mixed Model using the stratification factor in the model.  
o If the Normality assumption is not met, a non -parametric method or a rank 
–ANCOVA analysis i.e., an ANCOVA analysis on rank -transformed data 
will be used.  
• Categorical data summaries will be based on Logit model using the stratification 
factor in the mo del. 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
• Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer, Quality of Life Questionnaire Core -30 (EORTC QLQ - C30) Score  
• Change from baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  Quality of Life Questionnaire -Pancreatic 26 (EORTC QLQ - PAN26) Score  
Similar analysis methods used for secondary endpoints will be applied to the analysis 
of the exploratory endpoints. Detailed analysis methods will be described in the SAP. 
9.8.3.2 Supportive Analysis  
To assess the consistency of the Primary Analysis results, supportive analysis will be 
conducted using the Per Protocol (PP) population. Statistical methodology for the supportive analyses will be the same as that of the primary analysis, with th e exception 
of the analysis population used. The PP population will be used for the supportive analysis while ITT population will be used for the primary analysis.

11.1 Monitoring Requirements  
In an effort to fulfil the obligations outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
Part 312 and ICH guidelines which requires the Sponsor to maintain current personal knowledge of the progress of a study, the Sponsor's designated  monitor will visit the 
center(s) during the study as well as maintain frequent telephone and written communication. The Investigator will permit the Sponsor to monitor the study as frequently as is deemed necessary and provide access to medical records to  ensure that 
data are being recorded adequately, that data are verifiable and that protocol adherence is satisfactory.  
The Investigator will permit representatives of the Sponsor and/or designated CRO to inspect all e CRFs and corresponding study subject original medical records (source 
documents) at regular intervals throughout the study. Subject original medical records and other relevant data must be available to support all data recorded in the e CRF. In 
addition to the original medical records, these da ta may include but are not limited to, 
study, laboratory and diagnostic reports, quality of life questionnaire, etc.  
Site inspections serve to verify strict adherence to the protocol and the accuracy of the 
data being entered on the case report forms, in accordance with federal regulations. A Monitoring Log will be maintained at each study site which the monitor will sign, date and state the type of visit.  
The Investigator should be aware that the study site and subject records may be 
inspected by the Sponsor and or representatives of the designated CRO, FDA or other regional regulatory authority. 
For the IA, a cut -off date for data collection and monitoring will be determined and 
sites will be requested to provide current information up to the cut- off dat e. 
11.2 Acceptability of electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRFs)  
eCRFs must be completed for each subject who has signed an informed consent form. 
For subjects who are screen failures, this would be limited to the screen failure e CRF 
page. All source documents and eCRFs will be completed as soon as possible after the 
subject's visit. Corrections to data on the e CRFs will be documented. The Investigator 
will review e CRFs to indicate that, to his/her knowledge, they are complete and 
accurate. e CRFs will be reviewed b y the Sponsor’s or designated CRO’s monitor, who 
will make a decision as to their acceptability.

2. When the modification does not involve the subject’s participation in the trial. 
An amendment may also require modification of the informed consent form. The 
Investigator will provide an approval letter for the amendment and revised informed consent form, if applicable, to the Sponsor. An amendment must be in writing and it must be dated by both the Sponsor and the Investigator. If necessary, the Sponsor will submit protocol amendments to FDA and other appropriate regulatory authorities and notify other Investigators using this protocol. 
11.4 Reporting Protocol Deviations 
The Investigator is obligated to follow the protocol without departure from the 
requirements written in the protocol. If the Investigator deviates from the protocol requirements, the Sponsor will make the determination as to whether the subject will continue in the study. The Sponsor also has the right to discontinue the subject for protocol violations. The IRB may also have to be contacted if safety to the subject or if the scientific soundness of the study is involved. All protocol deviations must be documented in the e CRFs.  
11.4.1 Major Protocol Deviation or Violation 
A major protocol deviation or violation is a deviation from the IRB approved protocol that may affect the subject's rights, safety, or well -being and/or the completeness, 
accuracy and reliability of the study data.  Examples of this include: 
• A research subject received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose.  
• A research subject met withdrawal criteria during the study but was not withdrawn.  
• A research subject received an excluded concomitant medication . 
• A research subject does not meet the protocol's eligibility criteria but was enrolled 
without prior approval from the sponsor. 
• Failure to obtain informed consent prior to initiation of study- related procedures  
• Failure to treat research subjects per protocol procedures that specifically relate to primary efficacy outcomes.  
• Changing the protocol without prior sponsor and IRB approval. 
• Multiple minor violations of the same nature after multiple warnings.  
11.4.2  Minor Protocol Deviation or Violation 
A minor protoc ol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study 
design or procedures of a research protocol that has not been approved by the IRB and 
which DOES NOT have a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or well -being, or 
the completeness,  accuracy and reliability of the study data.  Examples of this include:

including development  of its charter  and membership  selection.  The DSMB will 
be managed  in conformance with the  FDA  guidelines for DSMB independence, 
management, and oversight. 
The D SMB will monitor the safety of the trial from the beginning and at 
approximately six month intervals based on enrolment thereafter.  
The D SMB will consist of three members and will review all unexpected AEs, all 
related AEs, all SAEs, and all deaths during the Treatment and Follow -Up Phases. 
All expedited safety reports will be provided in real time to the D SMB chair upon 
being reported to FDA. At each meeting, the D SMB will be authorized to unblind the 
study upon unanimous vote in the event of any concerns about safety or lack of 
efficacy. Unblinded CRO personnel, separate and independent of the blinded CRO personnel, will supply the D SMB with all necessary tables and listings to perform 
their independent review. The Sponsor will be invited to attend open sessions where data remain blinded, but will not attend closed sessions where data are discussed in more detail with potential unblinding. The  DSMB will make the following 
recommendations at each safety evaluation:  
 Continue the study as planned; 
 Assess a specific aspect  of safety  that is not conclusive; 
 Gather  more  data to address a specific safety  issue; and 
 Stop the study due to safety  concern s. 
The DSMB will make  the following additional  recommendation  at the efficacy  
evaluation: 
 Continue the study as planned; 
 Assess a specific aspect  of efficacy  that is not conclusive; 
 Gather  more  data to address a specific efficacy  issue; and  
 Stop the study due to lack of efficacy . 
The Sponsor retains  the responsibility to contact  FDA  and the final decision  
regarding  the recommendation  to continue or to terminate  the study.

13.3 Subject Informed  Consent Requirements  
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 115 of 125 Written and oral information about the study in a language understandable by the 
subject will be given to all subjects by the Investigator and/or designee. Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any procedures or assessments that would not otherwise be required for the care of the subject are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards, and insurance arrangements in force are explained and the subject has been given sufficient t ime to 
ask questions and consider participation in the study. It will also be explained to the subjects that they are free to refuse entry into the study and free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment. It is permissib le for a third 
person (e.g., a family member) to be present during the explanation of the study. 
The written Informed Consent Form ICF is to be in compliance with CFR 21 Part 50.27 
and GCP guidelines. The Sponsor and/or designated CRO will approve the ICF and all amendments to the ICF prior to submission to the IRB/IEC. A copy of the ICF to be used will be submitted by the Investigator to the IRB/IEC for review and approval prior to the start of the study. Each study site must provide the Sponsor with an unsigned copy of IRB/IEC -approved ICF along with applicable documentation to support this 
approval. The original signed ICF is retained in the subject's study records, and a copy is provided to the subject. A second copy may be filed in the subject’s medical  record, 
if allowed by institutional policy.

14.1 Recording and Collection of Data 
The primary source document for this study will be the subject's medical record. If 
separate research records are maintained by the Investigator(s), the medical record and the research records will be considered the source documents for the purposes of auditing the study.  
Applicable source data will be manually transcribed to approve electronic case report 
forms (e CRF). The Investigator is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the data 
transcribed on the forms. All source documents and e CRFs will be completed as soon 
as possible after the subject's visit . 
The Investigator will review e CRFs to indicate that, to his/her knowledge, they are 
complete and accurate. Designated source documents will be signed and dated by the 
appropriate study personnel. The Investigator must agree to complete and maintain source documents and e CRFs for each subject participating in th e study.  
All research data will be entered, either electronically or manually, into a computerized database. The clinical database will be designed by the clinical data manager in accordance with 21  CFR Part 11 and based on protocol requirements defined by  the 
Sponsor in association with the Lead Investigator.  
The Investigator will maintain a confidential list of study subjects that will include each 
subject’s study number, name, date of birth, and unique hospital identification number if applicable. This list will be kept by the Investigator and will not be collected by the Sponsor. A notation will be made in the subject’s case history/medical chart that he/she is participating in a clinical study and has provided a signed and dated ICF as well as a releas e for protected health information as required by local policies. The Investigator 
must also maintain a separate screening log of all the subjects screened for participation in the study; it should include gender, age, eligibility status, reason for inelig ibility, if 
applicable; and study allocated subject number, if applicable.  
14.2 Clinical Data Management 
The Sponsor and/or designated CRO will be responsible for the processing and quality 
control of the data. Data management will be carried out as described in the Sponsor’s or CRO’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical studies. 
The handling of data, including data quality control, will comply with regulatory 
guidelines (e.g., ICH E6 GCP, and local regulations where applicable) and the 
Sponsor’s or the CRO’s SOPs as well as provisions of the study -specific Data 
Management Plan.  
 
14.3 Archiving  
  Protocol No: CT 4006  
  Version  4.2; 2 8-Jan -2021  
 Confidential   Page 117 of 125  All study documentation at the Investigator site and Sponsor site will be archived in 
accordance with ICH GCP E6 and the Sponsor’s quality standards and SOPs. 
The Investigator will maintain all research records, reports, and case history reports for 
a period of two years after regulatory approval of the investigational product. If no application is filed or if the application is not approved, records must be maintained for two years after all investigations have been completed, terminated or discontinued and the FDA has been notified.  
These documents should be retained for a longer period however, if required by the 
applicable regulatory requirements or if needed by Sponsor or its authorized representative (as per GCP  5.5.11). 
At the completion of the study, details of the archival process must be provided to the Sponsor. Study records are subject to inspection by applicable health and regulatory agencies at any time.  
Records to be retained by the Investigator include, but are not restricted to: 
• Source data and the primary records upon which they are based (e.g., subject’s 
progress notes, adverse event data, test results, and any other diagnostic 
procedures required to evaluate the progress of the study) 
• Completed e CRFs  
• Signed protocols and protocol amendments 
• Laboratory results, ranges, and certifications 
• Product (e.g., IP, Standard Care supplies) and accountability records 
• Study personnel signature log 
• Monitoring logs  
• Correspondence to and from the Sponsor, designee and IRB 
• Investigator and sub- investigator CVs  
• Signed informed consent and protected health information consent forms 
• Subject screening and randomization log 
• SAE reports  
• IRB approval and re-approval le tters 
• Completed quality of life questionnaires 
• Other documents pertaining to the conduct of the study 
These documents must be maintained and kept on file by the Investigator so that the conduct of the study can be fully documented and monitored. 
At the com pletion of the study, details of the archival process must be provided to the 
Sponsor. Study records should not be transferred from site or destroyed without prior 
written agreement between the Sponsor and the study Investigator. Study records are subject to inspection by applicable health and regulatory agencies at any time.

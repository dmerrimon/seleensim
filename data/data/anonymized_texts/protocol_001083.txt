Name of Sponsor Company:  
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Drug Under Study:  ADX-102 
 
Title of Protocol:  A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Masked, Vehicle- Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Safety and 
Efficacy of ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution in Subjects with Non-infectious  Anterior Uveitis 
Protocol Number: 
ADX-102-UV-005  Phase: 3 Indication: Anterior Uveitis  
Primary Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy of ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution on  anterior chamber cell count 
(ACC), in subjects with non-in fectious anterior uveitis. 
 Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution on the signs and 
symptoms of anterior uveitis in subjects with non-infectious anterior uveitis.
 
Study Endpoints 
 Signs and symptoms of anterior uveitis which include anterior chamber cell count, anterior chamber 
flare, limbal injection, hypopyon, peripheral anterior synechiae, keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, 
ocular pain, lacrimation, photophobia, blurry vision and visual acuity  
 Incidence of adverse events (AEs), changes in clinical laboratory values and changes in intraocular 
pressure (IOP) values  
 Self-reported visual function with the National Ey e Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25)  
Study Design:  
This is a randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in which approximately 120 subjects with endogenous non-infectious anterior uv eitis will be randomized (1:1) to receive either: 
Group 1 ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution (0.5%)  
Group 2 Vehicle of ADX-102 Ophthalmic Solution 
Randomization will be stratified based on baseline ACC score. The dosing schedule is summarized in Table 1 . 
Subjects will be followed for up to five (5) weeks and m onitored for safety and effi cacy at seven (7) scheduled 
visits.  Efficacy will be assessed by standard ophthalmic  examination procedures and response to treatment will 
be graded according to established uveitis scales. 
Each subject’s study participation will consist of th e following visits: Screening/Randomization (Day 1; Visit 1 ), 
Day 4 +/- 1 day ( Visit 2 ), Week 1 (Day 8 +/- 1 day; Visit 3 ), Week 2 (Day 15 +/- 2 days; Visit 4 ), Week 3 (Day 
22 +/- 2 days; Visit 5 ), Week 4 (Day 29 +/- 3 days; Visit 6/EOT/ET) and Week 5 telephone follow-up (Day 36 
+/- 3 days; Visit 7/End of Study [EOS] ). The total time in the study is approximately 5 weeks. 
At the Screening/Randomization Visit, subjects will pr ovide written informed consent and then study eligibility 
will be assessed. Eligible subjects will be randomized, disp ensed study drug and instructed on dosing as well as 
on completing the subject dosing diary.  Subjects will be  randomly assigned treatment as described above.  
Treatment Period: Subjects will be instructed to administer study drug and to return to the clinic for Weeks 1 
through 4.  
Rescue therapy will be available to all subjects that do not demonstrate a clinical response based on predefined 
rescue criteria.  Rescued subjects will complete the Week 4 /  End of Treatment/Earl y Termination (EOT/ET)  
visit.

Proprietary and Confidential  *A history of prior flare-ups or subs equent flare-ups in the non-study eye sh ould not affect eligibility, provided 
that the subject is deemed capable of  administering separate treatments to  each eye. For example, if an enrolled 
subject experiences a flare-up in the non-study eye, the s ubject should remain in the study, and the non-study eye 
should receive the standard of care treatment. Likewise,  if a potential subject was already receiving standard of 
care treatment in the non-st udy eye prior to enrollment, the second eye is eligible for the st udy and the non-study 
eye will continue to receive the standard of care. 
 
Criteria for Exclusion:  
Subjects will be excluded from this trial if  they meet any of the following criteria: 
1. Have severe/serious ocular pathology in the study eye(s) which may preclude study completion, in 
the judgement of the Investigator. 
2. Any medical condition or clinical laboratory test which in the judgment of the Investigator makes the subject unsuitable for the study. 
3. Currently or within past  5 years, have a history of malignancy other than successfully treated 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or  successfully treated in situ cervical cancer. 
4. Active intermediate or posterior uveitis in the study eye(s). Note: a subject with isolated macular edema without evidence of active intermediate or posterior uveitis is eligible for enrolment.  
5. Known or observed mild to seve re (1-4+) fibrinoid reaction. 
6. Previous anterior uveitis episode in the study eye ≤ 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 . 
7. Cataract and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation su rgery or corneal transplantation surgery in the 
study eye(s) within the past 3 months prior to Visit 1, or subjects who may require penetrating intraocular surgery in the study eye(s) during the study.

have shown documented complete clearing of inflammation post-surgery in the study 
eye(s) are eligible. 
 Any other penetrating intraocular surgery in the study eye(s) within 3 months prior to Visit 
1 are eligible, assuming documented complete clearing of inflammation post-surgery in the 
study eye(s). 
8. Oral corticosteroid within the past 14 days prior to Visit 1 . 
9. Topical ocular corticosteroid treatment in the study eye within the past 14 days prior to Visit 1

Statistical Analysis:  Efficacy 
The primary efficacy analysis will be time to treatment success, where such time is defined as when a cell count 
of 0 is achieved and maintained to Week 4 without being rescued at any time prior to Week 4 will be analyzed 
using the method of Kaplan and Meier.  Between grou p comparisons will be made using the log rank test.

 Safety 
Adverse events will be summarized, and event rates will be presented by treatment arm. Any other information 
collected (such as severity or relationship to study drug ) will be listed as appropriate.  Any statistical tests 
performed to explore the data will be used only to high light any interesting comparisons that may warrant further 
consideration.  
DSMB 
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established. They will review all available safety 
data after approximately 25 subjects have completed th e study visit 7. The assessment of safety will be 
determined from ophthalmologic endpoints including slit la mp examinations, ocular scores, visual acuity and 
IOP, vital sign measurements, physi cal examinations, hematology and chemistry laboratory testing, use of 
concomitant medications, and review of adverse events (AEs).  Based on the safety data provided, the DSMB will 
determine if it is acceptable to continue the study or modify the study design as appropriate. Additional DSMB 
reviews will occur throughout the tria l approximately every 6 months or as  deemed necessary by the DSMB or 
Sponsor to ensure subject safety and well-being. Study enrollment and dosing will continue while the DSMB evaluates data.  A DSMB charter will be prepared.  Th e charter will contain the required information for the 
formation, activities and conduct of the DSMB.

a. FTA-ABS (Fluorescent trepon emal antibody absorption) 
b. TP-PA (T. pallidum particle agglutination assay) 
c. MHA-TP (Micro-hemagglutination assay) 
d. Laboratory specific automated Immunoassay (IA) 
A non-treponemal antibody test such as RPR (R apid Plasma Reagin) al one is not sufficient. 
If the study subject was tested prior to the screening vi sit, there needs to be evidence that these tests were 
performed: 
1) HLA-B27 at any time in the past 
2) Chest X-ray within the previous 6 months unless new onset pulmonary symptoms are documented 
3) Treponemal antibody test(s) within the previous 6 months unless intervening new onset symptoms of any STD, or STD exposure are documented 
Additional testing such as for RPR, ACE, ANCA, quantiferon and ANA may be performed at the discretion of the investigator.  
e  Safety laboratory tests are hematology including: “hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, RBC 
morphology, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and absolute platelet 
count” and chemistry including: “albumin, alkaline ph osphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT; SGPT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST; SGOT), bilirubin (total and direct), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, 
carbon dioxide (CO2), chloride, creatinine, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), glucose, phosphate, potassium, 
sodium, total protein, and uric acid.”

glaucomatous cups in the opinion of the investigator with non-glaucomatous visual fields 
if available, and may only administer a maxi mum of 1 topical medication to control IOP 
in the study eye.     
6. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) better than or equal to  35 letters in the study eye and 
65 letters in the non-study eye us ing ETDRS testing.  Note: this criteria is also applicable 
for a subject with bilateral uveitis. 
7. Females of childbearing potenti al must be using or willing to use a medically acceptable 
method (as defined by the Investigator) of bi rth control.  Women not of childbearing

Final: V4.0 20Jun2018 
 25 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential  Postmenopausal women are defined as wome n with cessation of menstruation for 12 
consecutive months prior to signing of the informed consent form.   
 
*A history of prior flare-ups or subsequent fl are-ups in the non-study eye should not affect 
eligibility, provided that the subject is deemed capable of admi nistering separate treatments to 
each eye. For example, if an enrolled subject exp eriences a flare-up in the non-study eye, the 
subject should remain in the study, and the non-study eye should receive the standard of care 
treatment. Likewise, if a potenti al subject was already receivi ng standard of care treatment in 
the non-study eye prior to enrollment, the second eye is eligible for the study and the non-study 
eye will continue to receive the standard of care. 
6.2 Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects will be excluded from this trial if they meet any of the following criteria: 
 
1. Have severe/serious ocular pathology in  the study eye(s) which may preclude study 
completion, in the judgement of the Investigator. 
2. Any medical condition or clinical labora tory test which in the judgment of the 
Investigator makes the subject  unsuitable for the study. 
3. Currently or within past 5 years, have a history of malignancy ot her than successfully 
treated squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or successfully treated in situ 
cervical cancer. 
4. Active intermediate or posterior uveitis in th e study eye(s). Note: a subject with isolated 
macular edema without evidence of  active intermediate or posteri or uveitis is eligible for 
enrolment.  
5. Known or observed mild to severe (1-4+) fibrinoid reaction. 
6. Previous anterior uveitis  episode in the study eye ≤ 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 . 
7. Cataract and intraocular lens (IOL) implantat ion surgery or corneal transplantation in the 
study eye(s) within the past 3 months prio r to Visit 1, or subjects who may require 
penetrating intraocular surgery in  the study eye(s) during the study. 
 Subjects who are 3 months past uncomp licated cataract a nd IOL implantation 
surgery and have shown documented complete clearing of inflammation post-
surgery in the study ey e(s) are eligible. 
 Any other penetrating intrao cular surgery in the study eye(s) within 3 months 
prior to Visit 1 are eligible, assu ming documented complete clearing of 
inflammation post-surgery in the study eye(s).

14.  Prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  agents or immunosuppressive agents, unless 
the dose has been stable for the last 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 and no change in dosing is 
anticipated for the dur ation of the study. 
15.  Systemic immunomodulatory agents (e.g. azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate 
mofetil), unless the dose has been stable for the last 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 and no 
change in dosing is anticipate d for the duration of the study. 
16.  Pregnant or lactating female, or female of childbearing potential and using inadequate 
birth control methods. 
17.  Have participated in anothe r investigational device or drug  study within 30 days prior to 
Visit 1 . 
18.  Participation in a prior ADX-102 study. 
Subjects with test results which do not meet the above inclusion/exclusion criteria may have the 
underlying test repeated once if it is thought to represent a labo ratory error; a reversible, 
clinically insignificant intermittent condition; or is  not consistent with the subject’s historical 
values.  If inclusion/exclusion criteria are not met afte r the repeat test, the subject should be 
considered a screen failure and s hould not be enrolled in the study. 
6.3 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations 
Exceptions to the above eligibility criteria will not be granted. It is expected that subjects will 
meet all eligibility criteria.  Departures from the protocol should be avoided, unless required for 
the safety of the subject.  Protocol deviati ons will be documented by the study monitor and will 
be included in the final clinical study report.  Protocol deviations should be submitted to the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), in accord ance with the site’s IRB requirements. 
6.4 Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study, or be removed from the study at the 
discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor, at any time.  The Inve stigator may withdraw a subject 

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol ADX-102-UV-005 
Final: V4.0 20Jun2018 
 27 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential  at any time if it is determined that continuing in the study would re sult in a significant safety risk 
to the subject.  
 
If such withdrawal occurs, or if  the subject fails to return fo r visits, the Inve stigator should 
determine the primary reason for a subject’s premature withdrawal from the study and record the 
reason in the subject’s study records. 
 
Premature withdrawal may occur for any of the following reasons: 
 
• Rescue therapy  
• Non-compliance with the protocol requirements 
• Death 
• Adverse event (AE)  
• Subject request 
• Investigator request 
• Sponsor request 
 For subjects who are lost to follow-up (i.e., thos e subjects whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the Investigator should 
show “due diligence” by documenting in the sour ce documents all steps taken to contact the 
subject, e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered  letters, etc. 
All subjects prematurely disconti nuing from the trial (prior to Visit 6 ), regardless of cause, 
should be seen as soon as possible for Visit 6/EOT/ET  assessments ( Section 5.4.4).   
 Subjects who are withdrawn from the st udy for any reason will not be replaced. 
7 Treatment of Subjects 
7.1 Subject Numbering 
Each subject will be assigned a unique subject number.  If a subject fails to be randomized, the reason for not being randomized should be doc umented in the source documents and case report 
forms (CRFs). The subject will be considered a screen failure. 
7.2 Description of Study Drug 
For study purposes ADX-102 and vehicle of ADX-102 ophthalmic solution are both referred to 
as study drug.

Final: V4.0 20Jun2018 
 28 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential  7.3 Concomitant Medications 
All medications that are taken by the subject in the 30 days prior to consent must be recorded 
during the Screening (Visit 1) .  Any changes in dosage or new medications added as a result of 
intercurrent illness must be recorded in the CRFs.

Once it is determined that rescue therapy is n eeded the subject should be  considered an Early 
Termination and the W
eek 4 (Visit 6) assessments should be completed. 
7.4 Prohibited Medications 
Use of the following medications is prohibited for the duration of a subject’s participation in the 
study from Screening (Visit 1)  through Week 4 (Visit 6/EOT/ET) :  
 
• Any investigational treatment other than ADX-102 
• Any medication part of  exclusion criteria (See Section 6.2 ) 
7.5 Treatment Compliance 
Study drug will be taken by the subject at home throughout the study.  Subj ects will be dispensed 
study drug at Visit 1, Visit 3, Visit 4 and Visit 5. Information on the time and date of each dose 
will be recorded by the subject in the dosing diary.  Subjects will be instruct ed to return all used 
and unused study drug and the dosing diary to the clinic at Visits 3 through 6. 
7.6 Randomization and Masking 
Subjects will be randomized through a centr al randomization process by IWRS during 
Screening/Visit 1 .  A randomization number will be assigned for dosing. 
ADX-102 and/or vehicle of ADX-102 ophthalmic so lution will be provided in subject packs 
masked to the subject, In vestigator and study staff. 
7.7 Unmasking Procedures 
7.7.1 Emergency Unmasking of Treatment Assignment 
Emergency unmasking should only be performed when  necessary in order to treat the subject.  
There is no known antidote to ADX-102, so symptomatic and supportive management of any 
suspected and treatment related adverse even t, if necessary, is clinically indicated. 
 Unmasking will result in the subject being disc ontinued from the study, irrespective of whether 
the Investigator ultimately agre es with the event being relate d to study drug (ADX-102).  Most 

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol ADX-102-UV-005 
Final: V4.0 20Jun2018

Proprietary and Confidential  often, study drug discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are 
sufficient to treat a study subjec t who presents with an emergency condition. The Investigator 
will have the ability to break the mask for any subject through the centralized randomization 
system (IWRS). However, the Investigator should  make every effort to contact the Sponsor’s 
medical monitor or their designee to discuss the subject’s emergency situation and the need to 
unmask prior to unmasking any subject, but must  contact the Sponsor or designee within one 
working day after the unmasking occurs. The ma sk may be broken in the case of a pregnancy 
should the subject desire this information. Any su bject for whom the mask is broken is to be 
discontinued from future study treatment.  The da te, time and reason for breaking the mask are to 
be recorded in the subject’s source documents. 
7.7.2 Unmasking for Regulatory Authorities 
In cases where unmasking is required for the purposes of reporting expedited safety events to 
country specific regulatory agencies or IRBs, th e unmasking will be perf ormed by an authorized 
member of the team.  A masked version of any documents to be submitted to the authorities will be shared as appropriate with st udy staff and site personnel. Only the authorized person(s) within 
the Pharmacovigilance and Regulatory Affairs will have access to the unmasked version of any documents. The procedures for requesting a nd obtaining unmasked information and for 
maintaining the integrity of the data and clinical trial are outlined in safety management plan.

using appropriate equipment.  
 
Blood pressure (BP) will be measured after at le ast 5 minutes of rest by using an automated or 
manual sphygmomanometer. The same method s hould be used for an individual subject 
throughout the study. The results will be recorded  in millimeters of me rcury (mmHg). HR will 
be measured in the radial artery  in the dominant arm for 30 seconds  and will be recorded as beats 
per minute (bpm). RR will be measured and recorded in breaths per minute. Body temperature 
(oral measurement) will be measured using a digital thermometer. 
9.1.4 Clinical Laboratory 
Samples of blood and urine will be collected for clinical laboratory te sts.  Tests will be 
conducted as designated below: 
9.1.4.1 Clinical Laboratory Tests Conducted 
Clinical laboratory evaluations will include: 
 
At Screening (Visit 1) and Week 4 (Visit 6-EOT/ET)  - Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
red blood cell (RBC) count, RBC morphology, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, 
mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cor puscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and absolute platelet count. 
 
At Screening (Visit 1) and Week 4 (Visit 6-EOT/ET)  - Serum Chemistry Profile: albumin, 
alkaline phosphatase, alanine am inotransferase (ALT; SGPT), as partate aminotransferase (AST; 
SGOT), bilirubin (total and direct), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, carbon dioxide (CO2), chloride, creatinine, creatinin e phosphokinase (CPK), glucose, phosphate, potassium, sodium, 
total protein, and uric acid.   
At Screening (Visit 1)  and Week 4 (Visit 6-EOT/ET) - For WOCBP a urine pregnancy test will 
be performed and must be negative for subjects to be enrolled. 
9.1.4.2 Abnormal and Clinically Significant Results 
The Investigator must categori ze all abnormal hematology and chemistry laboratory values as 
either clinically significant (C S) or not clinically significant (NCS). Clinical significance is 
defined as any variation in labo ratory parameters, which has medi cal consequences that result in 
an alteration in the subject’s medical care. In cas e of CS laboratory result s, the Investigator will

9.1.6 Ocular Scores 
Ocular pain, blurred vision, phot ophobia and tearing will each be measured using a visual 
analogue scale (VAS). The VAS is a continuous 100 mm line and subjects will be asked to 
indicate their level of agreement to a statement (0 = no symptoms, 100 = worst possible 
symptoms) by placing a single vertical on the scal e. The subject’s completed VAS will become 
the source document and the response, measured in mm from the left, will be transcribed into the 
CRF. 
 
The VAS will be administered at Screening, Day 4 , Week 1 , Week 2 , Week 3 and Week 4.

Proprietary and Confidential  9.1.7 Visual Acuity 
Visual acuity will be measured with spectacle or pinhole correction at each visit. The subject will 
be asked to read a standardized  eye chart (ETDRS).  Detailed instructions on Visual Acuity 
Testing are provided in the Study Ma nual.  Subjects should be encouraged to make an effort to 
read as many letters as possible on the chart. Di stance visual acuity only will be measured. The 
right eye should be tested first. Vi sual acuity will be measured at Screening, Day 4 , Week 1 , 
Week 2, Week 3  and Week 4. 
9.1.8 IOP Measurements 
IOP measurements will be taken using an accep ted tonometry method, which includes pneumatic 
tonometry, Tono-Pen applanation tonometry or Goldmann applanation tomnometry – depending 
on the preferred method at each site.  Once a subject has enrolled in the study, the same 
tonometry method will be used for that subject throughout the duration of the study . IOP will be 
measured at Screening , Day 4, Week 1, Week 2 , Week 3 and Week 4. 
9.1.9 Slit Lamp Exam 
External examination and biomicroscopy will be performed using a slit lamp.  Magnification will 
be consistent with standard clin ical practice. The clinician will examine and grade the eyelid and 
then examine the conjunctiva, cornea and anterior chamber of the eye with the aid of a slit lamp.  
Fluorescein dye will be instilled into the ocular cul-de-sac to f acilitate this examination.  The 
subject will be seated during the examination.  See Appendix 1 for grading scales. ACC grade 
will be determined and for Grade 1+ and lower on ly, a numerical cell count will be obtained. Slit 
lamp examination will be completed at Screening , Day 4, Week 1, Week 2 , Week 3  and 
Week 4. 
9.1.10 Fundus Exam 
A dilated funduscopic exam will be performed to ev aluate the vitreous, retina, choroid and optic 
nerve.  Fundus findings will be noted, described and graded as normal or abnormal. Qualitative 
descriptions will be provided for any abnor mal findings. A fundus examination will be 
completed at Screening , Day 4, Week 1, Week 2 , Week 3 and Week 4. 
9.1.11 Corneal Pachymetry 
Central corneal th
ickness will be measured by applanation ultrasound pachymetry. For each 
measurement the highest and lowest of five consecutive readings will be discarded, and the 
average of the remaining three will be recorded . In cases where a pachymeter is used that

Proprietary and Confidential  calculates an average central co rneal thickness from five or more measurements with a single 
touch to the eye, this average measurement ma y be used for the purposes of calculating the 
pachymetry corrected IOP. Corneal pachymetry will be completed at Screening. 
9.1.12 Dosing Instructions 
All subjects will receive written dosing instructions about how to properly administer their eye 
drops along with a printed dosing diary in which to document each dose. At Visit 1, the staff will 
review these materials with the subject and confirm that the subject understands th e instructions 
on how to dose and how to complete the diary. S ubjects will be instructed  to bring the dosing 
diary with them to Visit 3 through Visit 6 to be reviewed by the site staff. The site staff will 
ensure compliance and review/ remind th e subject on instructions as needed. 
 
Missed Doses:  If subjects forget to take a dose at the scheduled time, they should take that dose 
as soon as they remember and record th e time of dosing in the dosing diary. 
 
Exceptions: Subjects should not take a “make-up”  dose within one hour of another scheduled 
dose. Instead they should take the next sche duled dose and note the missed dose on the dosing 
diary. 
9.2 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse Event 
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a study drug, which does not necessa rily have a causal re lationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with th e use of the study drug 
whether or not it is considered related to the study drug. AEs will be collected from the time the 
subject signs the informed consent form through 30 days after the last st udy drug administration. 
 
Abnormal laboratory and other abno rmal investigational findings (i.e., physical exam) should not 
be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to treatment 
discontinuation or are otherwise co nsidered clinically relevant by the investigator.  In cases of 
surgical or diagnostic procedures , the condition/illness l eading to such a procedure is considered 
as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  In case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered 
as the AE, and the death is considered as its outcome.

Proprietary and Confidential   
Events Not to Be Considered as Adverse Events 
 
Pre-existing medical conditions/signs/symptoms pr esent before the screening period that do not 
worsen in severity or frequency during the study  are defined as baseline medical conditions, and 
are not to be considered AEs. 
 
All AEs must be recorded in the site’s study records and th e AE CRF with the following 
information:  
1. Relationship to Study Drug:  The Investigator  must assess whether they consider an AE 
to be drug-related. In assessing this relations hip, the Investigator must use information 
about the drug as outlined in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB), the s ubject’s pre-existent 
medical conditions/concurrent medication, and chronology of the event relative to drug 
administration.  
 
The following definitions will be used: 
 
• Definitely or possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluate d, are considered by the Investigator (or 
other qualified physician) to have at l east a possible relationship to study drug. 
 • Unlikely or not related applies to those AEs that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluate d, are considered by the Investigator (or 
other qualified physician) to have no relationship, or an  unlikely possibility of a 
relationship, to study drug. 
 
2. Event Severity:  The Investigator will be asked to use their medi cal judgment to assess 
the severity of the AE. 
 The following are guidelines to be used by the Inves tigator to judge the event severity of an AE: 
 
  
  
  
• Life Threatening 
 

Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol ADX-102-UV-005 
Final: V4.0 20Jun2018 
 38 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential  3.  Duration: Start and end dates and times, or if continuing. 
4. Frequency: whether the event is a single episode, recurrent or continuous. 
5. Action taken. 
6. Whether it constitutes a SAE, per definition below. 
7. Outcome: resolved, resolved/ with sequelae, continuing, death, or unknown (only for 
subjects that are lost to follow-up). 
 
The Investigator (or designee) should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the AE based on signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis , and not the individual 
signs/symptoms or laboratory abnormalities, should be documented in the subject’s source documentation and the CRF unless the etiology of  the event is unknown.   An assessment should 
be made at each visit (or more frequently if nece ssary) of any changes in severity, the suspected 
relationship to study drug, th e interventions required to  treat it and the outcome. 
9.2.2 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) 
A TEAE will be an AE that occurred during the study after the first dose of study drug or that 
was present prior to dosing and exacer bates after the first dose of study drug. 
9.2.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death: This includes death unrelated to the study drug (e.g. car accident).  If a subject 
dies during the study and an autopsy is performe d, autopsy results will become part of the 
subject’s study chart and a copy should be sent to the Sponsor. 
• Life-threatening experience. Life-threatening means that the patient was at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurr ed (i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form). 
• Required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization: Exceptions will be hos pitalizations for a) 
elective or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened si nce the start of study drug or b) treatment 
on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospital admission  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Congenital anomaly 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediatel y life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered  a SAE when, based upon medical judgment, 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol ADX-102-UV-005 
Final: V4.0 20Jun2018 
 39 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential  they may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. 
9.2.4 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected adverse event is defined as an AE, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the information in the Investigator’s Brochure for ADX-102. 
9.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The Investigator is respon sible for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causality , to the Sponsor or 
their designated representative by phone or fax (or email) within 24 hours of learning of the 
occurrence.  The reporti ng timeframe starts when the subject  signs the informed consent form 
through 30 days after the last study drug administ ration. At a minimum, a description of the 
event and the Investigator’s judgment of causalit y must be provided at the time of the initial 
report. These preliminary reports will be follo wed by detailed descrip tions that will include 
copies of hospital case reports , autopsy reports, and other do cuments when requested and 
applicable. 
 
Complications or progression of an initial SAE must be reported as a follow-up SAE Report to 
the original SAE, regardless of when the follow-up information is received by the Investigator.  A follow-up SAE Report must be submitted within  24 hours of the Investigator receiving the 
follow up information.  An SAE that is considered  completely unrelated to a previously reported 
one should be reported sepa rately as a new SAE. 
 In the event of a SAE, the inves tigator must immediately notify the appropriate contact in the 
Study Manual .  
 The procedures for reporting SAEs are as follows: 
 
• Complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report Form”.  The Investigator may contact 
Pharmacovigilance via the telephone hotlin e for assistance with SAE reporting. 
• Fax or email the SAE Form to the attenti on of Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
 The original copy of the SAE Report Form and th e fax confirmation sheet (or email) must be 
kept with the source docume ntation at the study site. 
 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol ADX-102-UV-005 
Final: V4.0 20Jun2018 
 40 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential  Follow-up information should be communicated the same way, using a new SAE Report Form 
stating that it is a follow-up to the previously reported SAE and giving th e date of the original 
report. The follow-up information should describe wh ether the event has resolv ed or continues, if 
and how it was treated, and whethe r the subject continued or wit hdrew from study participation.  
 
If the SAE was not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure and is thought to be 
related to study drug, the Sponsor or their designee may urgently require further information 
from the Investigator for regul atory authority reporting. The S ponsor may need to issue an 
Investigator Notification to info rm all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that 
this SAE has been reported.  
The Investigator and study pers onnel should institute any suppleme ntal investigations of SAEs 
based on their clinical judgment of likely causative factors. This  may include clinical laboratory 
tests not specified in the protoc ol, histopathologic examinations, or  consultations with specialists. 
The Sponsor or their designee may also request the Investigator to conduct supplemental assessments. 
 
The Investigator should notify Pharmacovigilance of any SAE occurring after a subject has 
withdrawn from the study when such a SAE occurs  within 30 days of the last dose of study drug 
and may reasonably be related to the study drug. 
9.4 Follow-up of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be followed until clinical database lock (or stabilization/resolution if it occurs 
before database lock).  All SAEs will undergo active follow-up until resolved or the event 
becomes chronic or stable.  Follow up data for SAEs obtained after clinical database lock will be 
incorporated into the safety database. 
9.5 Reporting Safety Information to the IRB 
The Investigator is responsible for following a ll local regulations for the reporting of safety 
information, including the repor ting of SAEs to the IRB. 
 
The Investigator must promptly report to his or her IRB all unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects.  This includes death from a ny cause and all serious adverse events reasonably 
or possibly associated with the use of study drug.  It is recommended that all SAEs occurring at a 
site, regardless of causality, be  reported to the site’s IRB in accordance with the IRB 
requirements. 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol ADX-102-UV-005 
Final: V4.0 20Jun2018 
 41 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential   
ADX-102 has been filed under an IND application with the US FDA.  An SAE may require 
safety reports to be filed to re gulatory agencies if the SAE is  related to the study drug and is 
unexpected based upon the current Inve stigator’s Brochure.  In this  case, the Investigator will 
receive a copy of the safety report as submitted to the regulatory agencies.  The Investigator is responsible for submitting the safety report (initia l and follow up) or other safety information 
(e.g., revised Investigator’s Brochure) to the IRB in accordance with the IRB requirements and 
maintain a copy in their files. 
9.6 Pregnancies 
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in  a subject on study drug must be reported to 
Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of  learning of its occurrence.  Subjects who become pregnant 
will be withdrawn from the study.  The pregnanc y should be followed up to determine outcome, 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, deta ils of the birth, and th e presence or absence 
of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a subject’s so urce documents and a Pregnancy Notification and 
Outcome Form and reported by the Investigator to Pharmacovigila nce using the same procedure 
for reporting SAEs detailed in Section 9.3 . A pregnancy, by itself, is not a SAE.   Pregnancy 
follow-up should also be recorded and should incl ude an assessment of the possible relationship 
to the study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any pregnancy-related SAE (e.g. spontaneous 
abortion) or any other SAE expe rienced during pregnancy must be recorded on a separate SAE 
Report Form and reported per SAE re porting procedures in Section 9.3.

10.3 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
An independent data safety monitoring board (D SMB) will be established. They will review all 
available safety data after approximately 25 su bjects have completed the study visit 7. The 
assessment of safety will be determined fr om ophthalmologic endpoints including slit lamp 
examinations, ocular scores, visual acuity and IOP, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, hematology and chemistry laborator y testing, use of concomitant medications, and 
review of adverse events (AEs).  Based on the safety data provided, the DSMB will determine if it is acceptable to continue the study or modify  the study design as appropriate. Additional 
DSMB reviews will occur throughout the trial approximately every 6 months or as deemed necessary by the DSMB or Sponsor to ensure  subject safety and we ll-being. Study enrollment 
and dosing will continue while the DSMB evaluate s data.  A DSMB charte r will be prepared.  
The charter will contain the required information for the formation, activities and conduct of the 
DSMB. 
10.4 Analysis

Final: V4.0 20Jun2018 
 43 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential  Safety population The safety population consists of al l randomized subjects who receive at 
least one dose of study drug, regardle ss of whether or not they undergo 
any study assessments.  Subjects in this population will be analyzed 
according to the treatment which they received.  All safety analyses will be based on this population 
ITT population The intent-to-treat population (ITT) is  the population of all subjects who 
are randomized into a treatment group.  Subjects in this population will 
be analyzed according to the treat ment group to which they were 
randomized. This population will be us ed for analyses of efficacy and 
pre-study/baseline ch aracteristics. 
PP population The per protocol (PP) po pulation is the subset of  ITT subjects who meet 
all inclusion and exclusion criteria , remain on study medication, comply 
with treatment instructions, and do not have any signi ficant protocol 
deviations or violations. Rescued subjects will not be excluded from PP solely on the basis of having been rescued and withdrawal of study medication and withdrawal from the study.  Significant protocol 
violations prior to being rescued ma y exclude a rescued subject from the 
PP.  Subjects in this population will be analyzed according to the 
treatment they receive. 
10.6 Accountability and Background Characteristics 
10.6.1 Enrollment and Disposition 
The number of subjects enrolled will be presented by treatment group.  The primary reasons for 
discontinuation will be summarized by treatment and based on the ITT population.  The number 
and percentage of subjects with protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PP population 
will be presented by reason for exclusion, stratified by treatment.  All deviations and rescued subjects will be listed. 
10.6.2 Subject Characteristics 
Subject characteristics will be obtained at the Screening/Visit 1  prior to randomization and will

qualitative variables will include frequency counts a nd percentages. 
10.8.1 Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred 
terms, and all summary tables for AEs will be organized by these categories. Frequency counts 
and percentages will be presented for subjects with AEs within each system organ class and 
preferred term, separated by treatment arm.  Both subjects ever experiencing an event as well as 
total events will be presented.  Descriptive stat istics will also be presented for AE relationship 
and AE severity. If multiple intensities are reporte d for a given AE for a subject, the most severe 
intensity will be counted.   
SAEs and TEAEs that resulted in termination of the study drug and with drawal from the study 
will be presented. 
11 Direct Access to Source Data/Documents 
11.1 Study Monitoring 
The investigator will allow the Sponsor or a designee to: 
 
• Inspect the site, the facilities, a nd the material used for the study; 
• Meet all members of the t eam involved in the study; 
• Consult all the documents relevant to the study; • Check that the CRFs have been correctly completed; 
• Have direct access to source documents for co mparison of data therein with the data in 
the CRFs; 
• Check that AEs have been documented; and • Verify that the study is carried out  in compliance with the protocol. 
 This study will be monitored at regular inte rvals, by agreement of the Investigator.  
All information dealt with during these visits will be treated as strictly confidential.  
The Investigator will provide th e sponsor with the following: 
• Progress reports at regular intervals • Adequately completed CRFs

 46 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential  11.2 Data Collection 
For each subject, CRF and corresponding source records will be maintained at each clinical site.  
Case report forms should be completed in a timel y manner, and every effort should be made to 
have forms completed and current in anticipatio n of a visit by the Sponsor’s monitor.  Upon 
study completion, the monitor will a rrange for a final review of th e study files, after which the 
file should be secured by storage for the appropriate period as specified in Section 14. 
11.3 Audits and Inspections 
The Investigator may be informed that an audit will be carried out, at the request of the Sponsor, 
before, during, or after the study. 
 
The Investigator will be informed that the Regulatory Agencies may also carry out an inspection. 
In this case, the Investigator mu st inform the sponsor as soon as  he receives the notification of 
inspection.  
The Investigator must allow the representativ es of the Regulatory Agencies and persons 
responsible for the audit to:  
• Inspect the site, f acilities, and material used for the study; 
• Meet all members of his team involved in the study; 
• Have direct access to study data and source documents; and 
• Consult all the documents relevant to the study. 
12 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
The Investigator or the appoint ed persons agree to complete the subject's CRF. Only the 
Investigator or appointed persons in his/he r team may fill out or  correct the CRFs.  
 
The Sponsor or their designee will review the CRF s entered by investigational site staff for 
completeness and accuracy and instruct the inves tigational site staff to make any required 
corrections or additions.  Queries will be sent  to the investigational site and designated 
investigational site staff will be required to respond to the query and edit data as necessary.   
 
All corrections and altera tions of data on the CRFs must be made by the Investigator or by the 
appointed persons as instructed in the CRF guidelines. If corrections or alterations are required 
of paper source documents, corrections may be ma de in the following manner: strike through the 
datum to be corrected using a single line so that the original remains legible; correction fluid 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol ADX-102-UV-005 
Final: V4.0 20Jun2018 
 47 of 53 
Proprietary and Confidential  must never be used. The correction should be written to the side or above the original entry and 
must be initialed and dated by the Investigator or designee. 
 
It is the responsibility of the monitor to make certain that all data are completed on the CRFs. 
At the end of each study period, the Investigator mu st sign and date the CRF to attest to the: 
 
• Authenticity of the data collected in the CRF, and • Coherence between the data in the CRF and those in the source documents. 
 Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Reference List, which employs th e Anatomical Therapeutic Chem ical classification system.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology. 
 
Randomization codes and study drug dispensa tion will be tracked using a centralized 
randomization process.  The system will be supplied by a vendor managing the database.   
 
After the above actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete 
and accurate, it will be locked for data analysis.  Any changes to the database after that time can 
only be made with the approval of Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc. 
 The Investigator will enter all subjects screened for study pa rticipation and the reason why 
individual subjects did not enter the study into the CRF. The Inve stigator must submit to the 
Sponsor or its representatives a completed CRF  for each subject who receives any study drug. 
 
If computerized medical files are used, and if the computer system allows, no change made in the 
medical files by the Investigator should obscure the original info rmation. The record must clearly 
indicate that a change was made and clearly provide a means to locate and read the prior 
information. The Investigator will sa ve data at regular intervals. 
 
The Investigator must guarant ee the integrity of the study da ta in the medical files by 
implementing security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the data and to the computer 
system. 
13 Ethics

STUDY DESIGN:  
This is a multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group trial of 
efficacy and safety of treatment  of CF subjects with lenabasum 20 mg BID and lenabasum 5 
mg BID .   
This trial includes analyses of event rate of and time to PEx.  In this study, primary definition 
of PEx is  based on the physician decision to treat wi th oral, intravenous or inhaled 
antibiotic(s) in the presence of  at least  4/12 Fuch’s criteria .  This definition excludes 
prophylactic antibiotics given at regularly scheduled times .  A new PEx is a PEx t hat occurs 
≥ 28 days from completion of antibiotic t reatment of any preceding PEx .  The prophylactic 
antibiotics taken at the scheduled time  at their regular dose  are not counted in this definition . 
The target population is males and females with CF ≥ 12 years of age with FEV1 ≥ 40% 
predicted and < 100% pre dicted in 12 months before screening .  The target population will be 
enriched for subjects with increased risk of a new PEx in the next 6 months.  Subjects must 
have 2 or 3 new PEx treated with intravenous ( IV) antibiotics in the 12 months before 
screening .  Alternatively, if the subject had  only 1 new PEx treated with IV antibiotics in the 

Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002

 last 12 months, then that subject must have  ≥ 1 other new PEx treated with oral antibiotics in 
the last 12 months before screening ; this excludes transitioning from oral to IV or IV to oral 
antibiotics for  the same PEx.  Antibiotics for the most recent PEx must be completed ≥ 28 
days before Visit 1.  
See Table 1 below for the eligibility criterion by number of new PEx in the 12 month s before 
screening . 
Table 1 Eligibility by Number of New PEx in 12 Months before Screening

intravenous antibiotics , N New PEx treated with oral 
antibiotics , N Eligibl e by PEx criteria  
2 or 3  No requirement  Yes 
1 ≥ 1 Yes 
0, > 3  Not applicable  No 
Assuming a screen failure rate of ~15%, ~ 490 subjects will be screened to identify a target of 
415 eligible subjects.  Assuming a ~15% drop -out rate, ~ 352 subjects are expected to  
complete the study.  
Subjects will be randomized centrally to treatment assignment before dosing  in a 2:1:2 ratio 
to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts:  
1. Cohort 1:  Lenabasum 20 mg BID, n = 166. 
2. Cohort 2:  Lenabasum 5 mg BID, n = 83. 
3. Cohort 3:  Placebo BID, n = 166. 
Randomization will be stratifi ed by factors that influence risk of PEx in the next 6 months or 
may be associated with differences in standard -of-care including treatment with CFTR -
target ing treatments: number of previous PEx requiring IV antibiotics in the previous year (1 
versus 2  or 3), FEV1 % predicted at baseline (< 70% versus ≥ 70% predicted) and location of 
site (United States versus Canada, and Europe) . 
Duration and Visi ts 
The screening period is up to 4 weeks before Visit 1.  Active dosing with study drug  is 28 
weeks .  There will be 8 scheduled study visits during active dosing with study drug, labeled 
Visits 1  - 8, which occur at Visit 1 and at the completion of Weeks 4 , 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 
28.  For Visits 1 -8, the window for each visit is ± 7 days.  Subjects who complete Visit 8 on 
study drug will have a Safety Follow -up Visit  labeled Visit  9. Visit 9 is 2 8 ± 7 days after 
Visit 8.  
Subjects who discontinue early from the study drug and do not withdraw consent will be 
asked to return for off -treatment safety and efficacy assessments at Visit 5 and Visit 8, as 
applicable.  Otherwise, they will return 28 ± 7 days  after the last dose of study drug for a 
Safety Follow -up Visit that is identical to Visit 9.  
All subjects who develop acute signs and symptoms of worsening lung disease will  be asked 
to return to the  site for evaluation at a P ossible PEx  Visit . 
Unscheduled Visits may be necessar y to assess the subject for safety purposes unrelated to 
new respiratory symptoms or a PEx.

 ● Lenabasum: The preparation of lenabasum that will be used in this study is a ≥ 97% pure 
synthetic preparation of a dimethylheptyl derivative of tetrahydrocannabinol -11-oic acid . 
● Placebo: Microcrystalline cellulose (no active ingredient) . 
Lenabasum and placebo capsules are identical in terms of appearance.  Both are packaged in 
the same type container closures with the same number of capsules.   
Subjects will self -administer the study drug  orally .  The first dose of study drug  will be 
admin istered at the site  at Visit 1, and subjects will be observed for TEAEs for at least 30 
minutes fol lowing dosing.  
DURATION OF TREATMENT:   28 weeks  
DISCONTINUATION FROM TREATMENT:  
Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessments:  
An individual subject will have study drug permanently discontinued if any of the following 
occur in the subject in question:  
● Withdrawal of consent  
● Pregnancy  
● Any serious TEAE probably or definitely -related  to lenabasum  
● Any life -threatening AE  
Unless consent is withdrawn or the subject is lost to follow -up, subjects who have study drug 
permanently discontinued prematurely will be asked to return for Visit 5  (if they have not 
already had Visit 5) and Visit 8, for all assessments scheduled at thos e visits .  If they decline, 
they will be asked to return for a Safety Follow -up Visit 28 ± 7 days after the last dose of 
study drug , which is identical to Visit 9  assessments . 
Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study:  
This study may be suspended or  prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  If any of the following events occur in a subject during enrollment, study entry and 
randomization of new subjects into the study will be suspended until review of the event in 
question occu rs by the Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC): 
● Death in any subject probably or definitely -related to lenabasum . 
● A life-threatening clinical event probably or definitely -related to lenabasum . 
● Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to su bjects that 
contradicts dosing of additional subjects in the opinion of the Chief Medical Officer of 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Corbus) . 
● Any new information about the execution of the trial, that in the opinion of Chief 
Medical Officer of Corbus contrai ndicates further study entry and randomization of new 
subjects, such as unsatisfactory enrollment with respect to quantity or quality, 
insufficient adherence to protocol requirements, data that are not sufficiently complete 
and/or evaluable, falsification of records, or determination of futility.

 Administration of study drug may continue during the time of review in subjects who are 
already receiving study drug, based on the judgment of the Chief Medical Officer of Corbus.  
An expedited and cumulative review  of safety data and the circumstances of the event(s) in 
question will be conducted by the D MC, with additional external expertise as needed, to 
make recommendations to Corbus whether screening , randomization, and/or dosing can 
resume or should be discontinued, whether the protocol should be modified, or whether the 
study should be discontinued permanently.  Upon consideration of a cumulative review of 
safety and other data, the study can be discontinued permanently by Corbus.  
Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be 
provided by Corbus to the investigators and the respective country regulatory authorities.  If 
the study is suspended or prematurely terminated, the investigators will promptly inform the 
reviewing Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (hereafter referred to as 
the Ethics Committee or EC) at each site and will provide the reason(s) for the suspension or 
termination.  Review and approval by the reviewing EC at each site is required for 
resumption of the study in the event the study is interrupted.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
The Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP)  will be completed before database locking and 
unblinding.  
The study is expected to enroll approximately 415 subjects, with  ~166 subjects each in the 
lenabasum 20 mg BID and placebo BID cohorts and ~ 83 subjects in the lenabasum 5 mg BID 
cohort  (accounting for an approximate 15% dropout rate) .  The study provides 80% power to 
detect a significant difference between the lenabasu m 20 mg BID dose and placebo in the 
primary endpoint (PEx  event rate ) at a two -sided alpha of 0.05.  This is based on an event 
rate ratio of 0.65 when the the event rate in the control group is 0.80 (a 35% event rate 
reduction in the lenabasum group) . 
This also provides 90% power to detect a significant difference between lenabasum 20 mg 
BID and placebo BID in the secondary endpoint, time to first PEx.  This is based on an 
estimate of the probability of an event (PEx) in the placebo group of 0.60, an estima ted 
hazard ratio of 0.60 (risk reduction 0.40), and the probability of an event in the lenabasum 
group of 0.36.  
There will be four analysis populations.  The modified intent to treat (mITT) population will 
consist of all randomized subjects who received study drug.  These will be categorized by 
planned treatment.  This population will be used for the primary analysis. The safety set (SS) 
will consist of all subjects who received study drug.  This population will be categorized by 
actual treatment . 
The per protocol set (PPS) will consist of the mITT population minus subjects with major 
protocol deviations.  Major protocol violations are defined as those that may have a 
substantial effect on the efficacy assessment and will be determined before data base lock.  
The PPS will be used in sensitivity analyses.

 All data will be provided in data listings sorted by treatment groups, subject number, and 
visit.  Summary data will be presented in tabular format by treatment group.  Categorical data 
will be summarized by th e number and percentage of subjects in each category.  Continuous 
data will be summarized by descriptive statistics including subject number ( n), mean, 
standard deviation  (SD) , median, and range.  All percentages will be rounded to 1 decimal 
place.  Differ ences between treatment groups will be calculated as active – placebo.  The 
baseline measure will be defined as the last non -missing measure before initiation of study 
drug at Visit 1.  
Efficacy comparisons will be made between each dose of lenabasum and pl acebo.  The event 
rate of new PEx will be compared between the lenabasum and placebo groups using a 
Poisson regression model.  A sensitivity analysis will be performed using a negative binomial 
regression model.  
For time to first PEx, a Cox -proportional ha zards (regression) model will be used for 
comparing the covariate -adjusted difference in event time distributions between the active 
and placebo groups.  Covariates in the model will include all stratification variables.  A log 
rank test will also be perfo rmed as a sensitivity analysis.  
Continuous variable endpoints such as change in CRISS, change in CFQ -R domain scores, 
change in FEV1 % predicted, change in FEV1 m L, change in FVC % predicted, change in 
FVC m L, and change in BMI will be analyzed using a  mixed model for repeated measures  
(MMRM ).  The MMRM model will include stratification factors, visit, treatment, and 
treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.  
The treatment comparisons for the proportion of subjects who impr ove by predefined criteria 
(for CRISS, CFQ -R, and FEV1 % predicted) will be performed using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test.  
Data from subjects who discontinue study drug but do not discontinue the study and return 
for off -treatment Visit 5 and 8, as applic able, will be included as data for that cohort.   Thus, 
both on -treatment assessment of PEx and assessments of PEx after treatment discontinuation 
(for subjects who discontinued dosing early) will be included in primary analyses.  
No formal statistical testi ng will be performed to compare the safety in different cohorts.

severity of which is not consistent with study drug information in the Investigator’s 
Brochure, and (c) there is reason to conclude that the study drug caused the event.  
4 ETHICAL CONDUCT OF THE STUDY AND REGULATORY 
REQUIREMENTS  
4.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with United States (US)  and international ethical 
principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki Protection of Human 
Volunteers [21 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 50], Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 
84), and Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312) , in compliance with the approved 
protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Title 21 part 
312, European Union clinical -trial legislation (Directive 2001/20/EC), ICH guidelines, 
applicable government regulations, and institut ional research policies and procedures.  The 
investigator will ensure, through reporting to Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (hereafter called 
Corbus, which includes Corbus Pharmaceutics Inc. and its designees) that the relevant 
regulatory agencies are advised , according to their timelines for reporting, of all changes post 
study initiation that may in any way affect the safety of subjects.  
4.2 Ethics Committee  
This protocol will be submitted to the reviewing central or local Institutional Review Board 
or Independ ent Ethics Committee, hereafter referred to as the Ethics Committee (EC), for 
review and approval before the study is begun at any site.  The EC must be constituted 
according to the local laws/customs of each participating country.  Any  protocol  amendments 
will be submitted to the reviewing central or local EC for review and approval.  The EC will 
review the Informed Consent and Assent Forms, their updates (if any), and any written 
materials given to the subjects.  Any other documents that the EC may need to  fulfill its 
responsibilities, including subject recruitment procedures and any compensation available to 
subjects will be submitted to the EC by the local monitor/investigator.  The EC’s written 
unconditional approval of the study protocol and the Informe d Consent and Assent Forms

 will be in the possession of the investigator  and Corbus before the study is initiated.  The 
EC’s unconditional approval statement will be transmitted by the investigator  or designee  to 
Corbus before shipment of study drug  supplies to the site.  This approval must refer to the 
study by exact protocol title and number and should identify the documents by date and 
version reviewed , the date of review  and any updates after initial approv al. 
Corbus will write any amendment to the protocol that is needed.  Protocol and/or informed 
consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without prior written EC approval 
except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the subjects or wh en the change(s) 
involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study.  Such modifications will be 
submitted to the EC, and written verification that the modification was submitted should be 
obtained.  Where subject safety is at issue, with noti fication to Corbus, Corbus will assure 
that the FDA is notified according to the timelines established in 21 CFR  312 and all other 
relevant regulatory agencies are advised, according to their timelines for reporting.  
The investigator  or designee  is require d to notify the EC of: 
● Revisions of documents originally submitted for review . 
● Serious adverse events (SAEs) including Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction s (SUSAR s) occurring during the study. Corbus will also be notified . 
● New information that ma y adversely affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of 
the study. Corbus will also be notified . 
● Pregnancies occurring in female subjects  or female partners of male subjects . Corbus 
will also be notified . 
● Annual update and/or request for re -approva l. 
● Suspension or premature termination of the study.  Review and approval by the EC is 
required for resumption of the study at a site, in the event the study is interrupted . 
● Study completion.  
The investigator  must keep copies of all adverse event (AE) information, including 
correspondence with Corbus and the approving EC on file.  The inves tigator  will retain all 
EC records related to this investigation for at least 3 years , or as long as required by local 
regulations,  after completion of the research. Where subject safety is at issue, with 
notification to Corbus, Corbus will assure that  the FDA is notified according to the timelines 
established in 21 CFR  312 and all other relevant regulatory agencies are advised, according 
to their timelines for reporting.  Corbus or its designee will maintain copies of all 
correspondence with FDA and all ot her relevant regulatory authorities.  
Investigator  will permit study -related monitoring, audits and inspections of all study related

5 INTRODUCTION  
This document is a protocol for a human research study of lenabasum for treatment of CF. 
Lenabasum is an investigational drug that is being tested for safety, tolera bility, efficacy, 
mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetics in chronic and severe diseases with significant 
inflammatory and fibrotic components, including CF, systemic sclerosis, dermatomyositis, 
and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Lenabasum is not approve d by the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA), the United States FDA, or any regulatory body for any indication.  
Lenabasum triggers resolution of inflammation without immunosuppression.  
5.1 Background Information  on Cystic Fibrosis  
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects multiple organs, 
including the lungs, pancreas, liver, and intestine.  Cystic fibrosis is caused by one of many 
different  disease -causing  mutations in the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conducta nce regulator (CFTR), a cyclic AMP -dependent chloride channel ( Kunzelmann et al,  
2013 ).  Mutations in CFTR on airway epithelial cells in CF lead to defective Cl- secretion and 
Na+ hyperabsorption by airway epithelia  (Knowles et al,  1983 ).  CFTR also are found on 
cells of the immune system, such as neutrophils ( Painter et al,  2006 ), monocytes ( Ettorre et 
al, 2014 ), and T cells ( Shanshiashvili et al,  2012 ), where loss of CFTR function leads to 
abnormal immune cellular function.  In CF patients, disease -causing mutations in CFTR lead 
to abnormally thick mucus ( Burgel et al,  2007 ) and aberrant immune responses  (Cantin et al, 
2015 , Ratner and Mueller, 2012 ). 
The net result is a propensity in CF patients for recurrent infections and over -exuberant, yet 
ineffective leukocyte recruitment, phagocytosis, killing, and clearance of pathogens.  The 
bioburden of bacteria in the lungs is high with the microbiome skewed toward pathogens 
such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa  (P. aeruginosa ).  Chronic lung infiltration with neutrophils 
and release of neutrophil elastase and other enzymes contribute to bronchiectasis and 
pulmonary fibrosis, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF.  
Abnormalities in innate immune responses that lead to chronic inflammation contribute to the 
pathogenesis of CF ( Hartl et al,  2012 ).  These abnormalities include a decreased ratio of pro -
resolving to  pro-inflammatory lipid mediators  (Karp et al, 2004 , Ringholz et al, 2014 a 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002

  Page 25 of 122 
 Ringholz et al, 2014b ), increased production of proinflammatory chemokines, such as 
interleukin (IL) -8 (Kim et al, 2013 , Wojewodka et al, 2014 ), abnormal cell surface 
expression of toll -like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR5 ( Simonin -Le Jeune et al,  2013 ), and 
enhanced or impaired signaling through TLRs.  The abnormalities of innate immunity extend 
to functional disturbances in neutrophils ( Ng et al,  2014 ), ineffective bacterial uptake and 
subsequent killing by immune cells, reduced autophagy and cellular apoptosis in phagocytes 
(Mayer et al,  2013 ), and decreased clearance of apoptotic cells.  
Among the abnormalities of in nate immunity reported in CF is the inadequate production of 
“Specialized Pro -resolving lipid Mediators” (SPMs) which are molecules that initiate the 
physiologic process of resolution of inflammation.  The relative overproduction of pro -
inflammatory lipid mediators to SPMs in CF ( Karp et al, 2004 , Urbach et al, 2013 , Ringholz 
et al, 2014a , Ringholz et al, 2014b ) provides a mechanistic link to the failure of CF patients 
to resolve inflammation.  
In CF, the ratio of SPMs to pro -inflammatory mediators is disproportionately low, tissue 
inflammation is excessi ve and persistent, pathogens are not effectively cleared, and tissue 
fibrosis leads to irreversible and structural damage to lungs.  Of note, t he ratio of a key SPM, 
lipoxin A4, to a key  proinflammatory lipid mediator leukotriene B4 is low in bronchoalveol ar 
lavage fluid of CF patients ( Karp et al,  2004 ), even in the absence of infect ion (Ringholz et 
al, 2014a ).  Lipoxin A4 is produced by lipoxygenase interactions resulting from tran s-cellular 
cooperation of neutrophils, eosinophils, alveolar macrophages, platelets or airway epithelial 
cells, each expressing different lipoxygenase enzymes, which act in sequence in lipoxin A4 
biosynthesis (reviewed in Urbach et al,  2013 ).  Normally, CFTR are expressed on both 
neutrophils and platelets, and neutrophil -platelet interactions during acute inflammation 
initiate lipoxin A4 production ( Serhan  and Sheppard, 1990 ).  Platelets from patients with CF 
produce about 40% less lipoxin A4 than healthy subjects ( Mattoscio et al,  2010 ).  In addition, 
15-lipoxygenase expression, which is required for lipoxin A4 pr oduction, is reduced in CF 
(Ringholz et al,  2014a ).  In animal models of CF, mice deficient in CFTR have reduced 
production of lipoxin A4 by neutrophils and platelets ( Wu et al,  2014 ).  Importantly, in turn, 
lipoxin A4 increases CFTR protein expression ( Yang et al,  2012 ). 
Lenabasum is a synthetic molecule that activates resolution of inflammation.  It is a 
preferential  cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2 ) full agonist that has  12-fold greater affinity 
for CB2 than cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) ( Tepper et al,  2014 ).  Lenabasum shows  
little evidence of psychotropic activity at likely therapeutic doses, because of lim ited ability 
to cross the blood -brain barrier and reduced affinity for CB1.  
There are two major CB receptor subtypes: CB1, mainly expressed in the central and 
peripheral nervous system; and CB2, mainly distributed throughout immune and 
hematopoietic cells,  epithelial cells, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, skin keratinocytes, and the 
peripheral nervous system ( Rom and Persidsky, 2013 ).  CB2 is preferentially expressed on 
activated immune cells.  
Lenabasum induces “class switch” of arachidonic acid metabolism from proinflammatory 
lipid mediators to SPMs through effects on 15 -lipoxygenase ( Zurier et al,  2009 ) and possibly 
other lipid metabolizing enzymes.  Agonists of CB2 are know n to increase production of 
anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin (PG) J2 and cytokines, such as IL -10 
(Shanshiashvili et al,  2012).  Further, CB2 agonists  including lenabasum can  induce

 apoptosis  of T cells ( Bidinger et al,  2003 , Singh et al,  2012 ), and fibroblasts ( Garcia -
Gonzalez et al,  2009 ).  Of direct relevance to treatment  of CF, endocannabinoids and 
synthetic CB2 agonists blunt inflammation, innate immune responses and deposition of 
extracellular matrix, by:  
● Inhibiting expression of TLR and nucleotide -binding oligomerization domain (NOD) -
like receptors and TLR signal trans duction ( Downer et al,  2011 , Duncan et al,  2013 ) 
● Reducing production of early mediators of inflammation, including chemotactic factors, 
such as IL -8 (Selvi et al,  2008 ) and proinflammatory lipids  
● Inhibiting tissue infiltration with leukocytes, by inhibiting leukocyte rolling and tissue 
infiltration ( Mukhopadhyay et al,  2010 ), chemotaxis and differentiation of dendritic cells 
(Adhikary et al,  2012 ) 
● Reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines by these infiltrating cells, including 
type 1 interferons, IL -1β, IL -6, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and IL -17 (Zurier et al,  
2003 , Parker et al,  2008 , Selvi et al,  2008 , Kong et al,  2014 ) 
● Inhibiting acc umulation of myofibroblasts, production of transforming growth factor -β 
(TGFβ), connective tissue growth factor, and extracellular matrix components 
(Akhmetshina et al,  2009 , Gonzalez et al,  2012 , Börgeson et al,  2011 , data on file)  
“Class switching” of lipid mediators ( Levy et al,  2001 ) to favor production of lipoxin A4 and 
other SPMs would be expected to have therapeutic benefit in CF, through effects on multiple 
pathologic pathways in CF.  As examples, lipoxin A4:  
● Enhances CFTR protein expression, at least in rat lungs ( Yang et al,  2012 ) 
● Decreases mucus thick ness through effects on ion transport  (Al-Alwa ni et al,  2014 , 
Verrière et al,  2012 ) 
● Increases airway epithelium integrity ( Buchanan et al,  2013 ) 
● Attenuates pulmonary fibrosis ( Martins et al,  2009 , Krönke et al,  2012 ).  Lipoxin A4 
inhibits fibroblast proliferation ( Wu et al,  2006 ) and TGFβ receptor type 1 expression 
and responses to TGFβ ( Brennan et al,  2013,  Börgeson et al,  2011 ).  Of note, high 
producer TGFβ1 genotypes are associated with severe lung disease  in CF ( Arkwright et 
al, 2000 ),  TGF -β signaling and fibrosis are markedly increased in CF  (Harris et al,  
2013 ) and TGFβ may interfere with therapies directed at correcting the pr ocessing defect 
in CFTR in CF patients ( Snodgrass et al,  2013 ). 
Therapeutic approaches to reduce inflammation  in patients with CF have shown clinical 
benefit , such as alternate -day corticosteroids and high dose ibupr ofen ( Konstan et al,  2007 ), 
but adverse effects and other considerations have limited their use.  Alternative agents to 
reduce lung inflammation and resulting fibrosis are needed .  The development of new 
therapies that  will do this is a strategic priority for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.   
Lenabasum is being investigated as a new therapy for CF because of its potential to resolve 
inflammation and stop  pro-fibrotic processes in CF.   Lenabasum triggers the physiologic 
process of resolution of inflammation.  It reduces levels of pro -inflammatory mediators and 
increases levels of SPMs including lipoxins and resolvins in involved tissues.  Lenabasum  
reduces polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrates and improves bacterial clearance in the

 lungs in a mouse model of infection -induced inflammation in CF.  Similarly, lenabasum 
reduces polymorphonuclear infiltration and pro -inflammatory mediators while haste ning 
bacterial clearance in a human model of infection -induced innate immune response in the 
skin.  
5.2 Findings from Nonclinical Studies with Potential Clinical 
Significance  
Please see the IB for details of nonclinical studies.  
5.2.1 Animal Safety Data  
Nonclinical s afety program for lenabasum includes safety pharmacology, general toxicology, 
reproductive and developmental toxicology, and genotoxicity studies.  Major findings 
identified from the completed animal studies following repeated administration in duration 
up to 26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs are:  
● Estimated single lethal doses are 400 mg/kg in rats and 600 mg/kg in mice  
● A 13-week toxicology study (MAM0003) was conducted in the rat.  The age of rats 
receiving lenabasum treatment were as young as 38 days at the start of twice -daily 
dosing. Based on animal and human comparative developmental schedules ( Buelke -Sam 
2003 ), the human -equivalent age of these rats appropriately covered the target adolescent 
ages of 12 to 17 year s. There were no adverse effects noted at any dose evaluated.  
● The NOAELs in 26 -week rat toxicology study was 5 mg/kg BID, resulting in a gender -
combined mean Cmax value of 2363 ng/ml and AUC 0-24 of 27050 ng·hr/ml.  At NOAEL, 
the system exposure multiples w ere 3.7× and 3.7× higher than the clinical C max and 
AUC 0-24 value at 20 mg BID (40 mg/day total dose), respectively .  
● The NOAELs in 39 -week dog toxicology study was 2 mg/kg BID, resulting in a C max 
value of 1171 ng/ml and AUC 0-24hr of 14,581 ng·hr/ml.  At NOAEL, the system exposure 
multiples were 1.8× and 2.0× higher than the clinical C max and AUC 0-24 value at 20 mg 
BID (40 mg/day total dose), respectively.  
● Clinical signs consistent with an effect on the central nervous system were seen at doses 
of 8 mg /kg and higher in dogs and 50 mg/kg and higher in rats .   
● No clinical or anatomic pathology changes indicative of organ toxicity and no treatment 
related microscopic findings were observed in the repeat dose studies . 
● There were no treatment -related organ w eight changes in dogs in multiple dose studies. 
Organ weight changes in the 13 -week study in rats were considered secondary to lower 
body weight . 
● Minor potentially treatment -related alterations in clinical chemistry parameters were 
observed at high doses.  Mild increases in blood urea, mild increases in urine volume and 
decreased osmolarities, with normal creatinine, mild decreases in serum glucose, mild 
increases in alkaline phosphatase, and mild decreases in protein and albumin were noted  
● No teratogenicit y in embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at any evaluated 
dose, 9.0× in rats and 1.2× in rabbits , respectively,  higher than the clinical AUC 
exposure value at oral dose of lenabasum 20 mg BID .

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 28 of 122 
 ● In a fertility and early embryofetal rat study  (i.e., Segment 1), lenabasum had no effect 
on male and female fertility, and male reproductive performance at any evaluated dose, 
with a systemic AUC exposure value 3.9× higher than the clinical exposure at an oral 
dose of lenabasum 20 mg BID.  The NOAEL for female reproductive function was 
determined to be 4 mg/kg/day with an AUC value 1.3× higher than clinical exposure at 
an oral dose of lenabasum 20 mg BID.  
● Lenabasum was not mutagenic or clastogenic in in vitro  or in vivo  genotoxicity studies .   
● Compar ed to morphine, lenabasum demonstrated a low potential for the development of 
physical dependence in an evaluation of potential for abuse in rats . 
● No characteristic physiologic effects of peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor 
gamma activation such as edema/fluid retention, cardiac hypertrophy, or hematologic 
changes were observed in the chronic toxicology studies of lenabasum treatment 
duration of up to 26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in dogs.  These findings are consistent 
with in vitro assays of lenaba sum that demonstrated relatively weak receptor occupation 
of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma .  
● Animals exposed to lenabasum in standard toxicology studies have not shown signs of 
immunotoxicity at doses above the NOAEL and up to 40 mg/kg t hree times daily for 13 
weeks and 5 mg/kg BID for 26 weeks.  The following signs of immunotoxicity were not 
observed at evaluated doses:  
o Leukocytopenia, granulocytopenia, or lymphopenia  
o Alterations in immune system organ weights and/or histology (e.g., cha nges in 
thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and/or bone marrow.  The sole exception is that in a 
non-pivotal 7 -day gavage study in rats, a reduction in thymus weight was seen in 
female rats given 100 mg/kg daily  
o Reduction in serum globulins  
o Increased incidence of  infections  
o Increased occurrence of tumors.  
5.2.2 Animal Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  
Toxicokinetic analyses in the repeat -dose toxicity studies indicate that after oral 
administration of lenabasum to rats and dogs, increases in plasma exposures of lenabasum 
were generally dose -proportional, and no consistent gender differences were apparent. In 
both the rat and dog, time to peak plasma concentrations (T max) was usually 1.5 to 3.0 hours 
post-dose indicating rapid absorption.  The estimated t 1/2 range d from approximately 3 to 5 
hours.  Because of its relatively short plasma half -life, lenabasum was administered BID or 3 
times daily in toxicology studies; no accumulation occurred after repeated dosing.  
In vitro  metabolism studies of lenabasum in cryopreserved rat, dog, monkey, and human 
hepatocytes indicate minimal hepatocyte metabolism of lenabasum.  The amounts of 
metabolites formed relative to unchanged lenabasum were < 2% for any single metabolite 
and < 5% f or all 5 metabolites in total.   
An in vivo  metabolism stud y of lenabasum was conducted in rats  and dogs . Samples were 
analyzed using a qualitative LC -MS/MS method.  Lenabasum and up to 11 metabolites were 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002

  Page 29 of 122 
 detected across the plasma samples analyzed.  Cons istent with the previously -conducted in 
vitro  metabolism study results, unchanged lenabasum was the major circulating plasma 
component in rats  and dogs.  Several glucuronide conjugates were detected in both animal 
plasma samples, but the specific structure s of the glucuronides have not been determined.  
They are not considered to be any safety concerns mainly because of low quantity and 
involvement of a major Phase II detoxification pathway.  
Lenabasum did not inhibit human cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYP 1A2,  CYP 2C9, CYP 
2C19, CYP 2D6, and CYP 3A4/5) at concentrations up to 50 µM and the potential for drug 
interactions involving the CYPs tested was minimal.  
Plasma protein binding generally was very high and exceeded 97% (i.e., > 97% protein -
bound concentratio n) in any species or concentrations tested. In dogs and rats, lenabasum 
binding to plasma proteins slightly increased at higher len abasum concentrations . 
5.2.3 Animal Efficacy  
The effects of lenabasum were tested in a murine model of CF with CFTR F508del 
mutatio ns, gut corrected  (Bonfield and Tepper, 2015 ).  In this CF model, lung infection with 
P. aeruginosa  is associated with excessive and prolonged lung inflammation and infection, 
increased weight loss and reduced surviva l.  In these experiments, wild -type and CFTR -
mutant mice were infected with P. aeruginosa  with or without treatment with lenabasum 1 
mg/kg BID or 5 mg/kg BID, then sacrificed at Day 10.  There was no evidence of 
immunosuppression with lenabasum at Day 10 i n wild -type or CFTR -mutant mice.  At Day 
10, the lenabasum -treated CFTR mice had reduced neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage 
fluid and reduced bacterial colony forming units in their lungs with levels similar to those in 
wild type mice.  They also had an  increase in weight and survival.  These results are 
consistent with increased resolution of infection -activated innate immune responses in this 
animal model of CF.  
Other studies of lenabasum demonstrated evidence of clinical efficacy in multiple animal 
models of inflammation and fibrosis. The exposure at which this activity was seen varied, 
and the human equivalent of the median effective dose (ED 50) or active doses in all these 
animal models were ≤ 20 mg per day, with a mean human equivalent ED 50 of about 5 mg per 
day.  The difficulties in translating ED 50 doses in animal models to human equivalent ED 50 
doses are acknowledged.  In these studies, lenabasum:  
● Caused a 75% reduction in neutrophils invading the peritoneum in a mouse model of 
peritoniti s and a 7 -fold increase in lipoxin A4 ( Zurier et al, 2009 ). 
● Inhibited bleomycin -induced lung inflammation and fibrosis when administered in a 
prophylactic and therapeutic manner (data on file).  This was associated with  reduced 
myofibroblast accumulation, collagen production, TGFβ production and connective 
tissue growth factor production . 
● Inhibited bleomycin -induced skin inflammation and fibrosis when administered in a 
prophylactic and therapeutic manner (data on file).  This was associated with reduced 
myofibroblast accumulation and collagen production . 
● Reduced joint inflammation and ankylosis ( Zurier et al, 1998 ).

 ● Demonstrated potent anti -inflammatory and anti -allodynic effects in ro dent paw edema 
and hot plate assay ( Burstein et al, 1992 , Dajani et al, 1999 ; Burstein et al, 1998 ). 
5.3 Mechanism of Action of Lenabasum  
5.3.1 Lenabas um as a Selective Cannabinoid Receptor Type 2 Agonist  
Lenabasum is (6aR, 10aR) -3-(1,1-dimethylheptyl) -∆8-tetrahydro -cannabinol -9-carboxylic 
acid ( Figure 1), also known as JBT -101, anabasum, Resunab, ultrapure ajulemic acid, CT -3, 
IP751 and CPL7075.  Lenabasum is a synthetic analog of the terminal metabolite of 
tetrahydrocannabinol.  It is a selective CB2 agonist with 12.3 -fold greater affinity for CB2 
than cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) (Tepper et al, 2014).  The receptor binding constant 
or Ki of lenabasum for CB2 is 51 nM, and the receptor binding constant for CB1 is 628 nM 
(Tepper et al, 2014 ).  This CB2 selectivity  is based on a 7 -residue side chain that includes 2 
methyl groups.  The structure of CB2 also includes a -COOH group that reduces lenabasum’s 
ability to penetrate the blood -brain barrier, so that levels in the central nervous system are 
about 30% of those i n the plasma, at least in rats ( Dyson et al, 2005 ).  The preparation of 
lenabasum that will be used in this study is a ≥ 97% pure synthetic preparation of a 
dimethylheptyl derivative of tetrahydrocannabinol -11-oic acid.  Detailed study drug 
information can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Figure 1 Structural Formula of Lenabasum  
 Molecular Formula: C25H36O4 
Molecular Weight: 400.5 6 
CAS Number: 137945 -48-3 
Appearance: White to off white to tan to 
orange  powder  
The maximal plasma concentrations (C max) of lenabasum at 20 mg BID is ~ 550 to 650 
ng/m L, or ~ 1400 to 1600 nM  (see IB, data on file).  Because lenabasum is ≥ 97% protein 
bound (see IB), the concentration of free lenabasum in the plasma at this dose would be ~42 
to 48 nM.  At this concentration, ~50 -60% of the CB2 and ~6 -7% of CB1 would be occupied 
by lenabasum.  At these relative levels of receptor occupancy, lenabasum’s pharmacological 
activity would be preferentially mediated by CB2.  
In receptor binding studies, lenabasum selectively binds and activates CB2 compared to CB1.  
In functional assays, lenabasum has h igher potency for CB2 than CB1 ( Tepper et al, 2014 ).  
As expected from the results of the binding assays, in vitro  experiments with CB2 and CB1 
antagonists demonstrate that pharmacological activities of lenabasum are se lectively 
mediated through CB2 ( Tepper et al, 2014 ).

 5.3.2 Regulation of the Resolution Phase of Innate Immune Responses by CB2  
The resolution phase is normally initiated soon after the onset of an innate immune response, 
when interactions between neutrophils and platelets lead to a “class switch” in the bioactive 
lipid mediators that are produced ( Levy et al, 2001 ).  During the initiation of resolution, the 
balance of lipid mediators shifts from pro -inflammatory mediators to novel Specialized 
Pro-resolving Lipid Mediators or SPMs ( Buckley et al, 2014 ; Serhan et al, 2014 ; Serhan and  
Chiang 2013 ; Serhan et al, 2008; Levy et al, 2001 ).  Pro -resolving lipid mediators include 
4 families with overlapping effects, called lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and marescins.  
The endocannabinoid system is an evolutionarily ancient  neuro -immunomodulating system 
that has a significant role in regulating innate immune responses and associated wound 
healing, pain, and energy metabolism ( Serhan et al, 2014 ; Buckley et al, 2014 ; Serhan and 
Chiang 2013 ; Serhan et al, 2008 ).  Cannabinoid receptors are class A, rhodopsin -like, G -
protein coupled receptors.  There are 2 main CB receptor subtypes: CB1, mainly expressed in 
the central and peripheral nervous system, and CB2, mainly distributed throughout immune 
and hematopoietic cells ( Castaneda et al, 2013 ; Munro et al, 1993 ).  Following activation of 
an innate immune response, CB2 becomes expressed at 10 - to 100 -fold higher levels than 
CB1 on activated immune cells ( Carayon et al, 1998 ; Galiègue et al, 1995 ; Munro et al, 
1993 ).  Once the immune response is resolved, cell surface expression of CB2 returns to 
baseline levels ( Carayon et al, 1998 ). 
The endocannabinoid and innate immune systems intersect.  CB2 agonists trigger class 
switch of lipid mediators to favor pro -resolving lipid mediators ( Shinohara et al, 2012 ; Zurier 
et al, 2009 , data on file).  Inability to express CB2 or inhibition of CB2 leads to prolonged 
and excessive inflammation and fibrosis.  In  response to challenges that activate innate 
immune responses, CB2 knock -out mice have more severe inflammation and fib rosis through 
increases in nuclear factor kappa -light-chain -enhancer of activated B cells (NF -kβ 
activation), production of pro -inflammatory adhesion molecules, chemokines, cytokines, 
production of superoxide generating enzymes, immune cell recruitment, an d reduced 
apoptosis of lymphocytes ( Trebicka et al, 2011 ; Engel et al, 2010 ; Mukhopadhyay et al, 
2010 ; Servettaz et al, 2010 ; Deveaux et al, 2009 ; Tschöp et al, 2009 ; Julien et al, 2005 ).  For 
example, one mou se model uses hypochlorite injections to induce fibrosis in the lungs.  
When experiments are done in CB2 knockout mice, fibroblast proliferation and lung fibrosis, 
are all increased ( Servettaz et al, 2010 ).  In the s ame model, treatment with a CB2 agonist 
prevents the development of lung fibrosis and reduces fibroblast proliferation.   
Thus, CB2 is a receptor shared by the endocannabinoid and innate immune systems that 
regulates the degree of inflammation and fibrosis that occurs following the onset of an innate 
immune response, by turning “on” resolution to turn “off” the innate immune response, 
restoring homeostasis.  Activation of CB2 has the potential to limit inflammation and fibrosis 
that occurs in CF and provide clinical benefit.  
5.3.3 Activity of Lenabasum in Cells Isolated from Humans with CF   
To further test the potential of lenabasum to resolve lung inflammation in CF, studies tested 
direct effects of lenabasum on lung macrophages isolated from CF patients.  Macroph ages 
were isolated from lungs excised from two CF patients undergoing lung transplantation.  To 
simulate their response to infection, the macrophages were stimulated with pseudomonas 
lipopolysaccharide at 100 ng/ml for 6 hrs.   These macrophages were expose d to lenabasum

 (1, 3, 10 μM) prior to, concomitantly, or after lipopolysaccharide  stimulation.  After 6 hours, 
TNF α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL -8 were measured in culture supernatants using ELISA assays, and 
the mRNA level of transcription factor XBP -1 was measur ed by quantitative reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.  
Lenabasum reduced lipopolysaccharide -stimulated production of TNF α and IL -6 by CF lung 
macrophages in a dose -dependent fashion with up to >75% inhibition at 10 μM lenabasum. 
This inhibitio n occurred when lenabasum was added prior to, concomitantly, or after 
lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore, lenabasum inhibited the expression levels of 
XBP -1, the CF pulmonary macrophage transcription factor with a role in lipopolysaccharide -
induce d endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammatory response by up to ~85% in a time -
dependent manner with 24 hours treatment being maximal.  The inhibition by lenabasum of 
TNF α and IL -6 production by CF lung macrophages  provides evidence for direct effects of 
lenabasum on an important cell type and mediators in the pathogenesis of CF lung damage.  
5.3.4 Proof of Mechanism of Action of Lenabasum in Humans  
A human model of an acute inflammatory response to bacteria was used  to determine pro -
resolution propert ies of lenabasum ( Motwani et al, 2017 ).  In this model, ultraviolet light -
killed E. coli  is injected intradermally in healthy human volunteers and a suction blister over 
the site of injection is used to obtain blister fluid for analysis of cells and mediators in the 
underlying tissue ( Motwani et al, 2016 ).  Subjects received lenabasum 5 mg BID, 20 mg 
BID, placebo BID or 15 mg prednisolone QD for 4 days and were challenged with 
intradermal E. coli  on the morning of the fourth day.  Inflammatory c ells and mediators were 
measured at  the time of peak acute inflammation (4 hours)  and th e initiation of the resolution 
phase of acute inflammation (10 hours).   Lenabasum 5 mg  BID exerted a pot ent anti -
inflammatory effect equivalent to that of 15 mg prednisolone in terms of inhibiting neutrophil 
infiltration during the activation phase of the innate immune response. At 20 mg BID 
lenabasum had similar effects on neutrophil infiltration and also triggered the synthesis of the 
SPMs lipoxin A4, lipoxin B4, resolvin D1 and resolvin D3.  Lenabasum also dose -
dependently and significantly inhibited the neutrophil chemoattractant leukotriene B4 as well 
as prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2 and prostag landin F2 biosynthesis, but did not affect 
the vasodilator prostacyclin.   Lenabasum significantly cleared ultraviolet light -killed E. coli  
derived endotoxin from the injected site, which arose from the inhibition of anti -phagocytic 
prostanoids.  Collectiv ely, lenabasum had striking pro -resolving effects in this model . 
5.4 Summary of Potential Clinical Benefit of Lenabasum in Cystic 
Fibrosis  
Lenabasum is a novel synthetic selective oral agonist of cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) 
that activates resolution of i nnate immune responses.  Lenabasum is being developed as a 
chronic oral therapy for treatment of CF, to be used alone or in conjunction with other 
treatments for CF.   
The physiologic process of resolution of inflammation is initiated during an innate immune 
response when lipid mediator production undergoes a class -switch from pro -inflammatory 
mediators that activate innate immune responses (such as leukotriene B4 and pr ostaglandin 
E1) to SPMs (members of the lipoxin, protectin, marescins, and resolvin families).  During 
resolution of inflammation, production of mediators that activate inflammation decrease to

 normal levels, new inflammatory cells do not infiltrate tissue s, inflammatory cells that are in 
tissues die by apoptosis and their cellular debris is removed by efferocytosis by macrophages, 
clearance of any residual pathogens occurs, and wound healing processes are completed 
including restoration of fibrotic process es to basal levels (reviewed in Serhan et al, 2014 ). 
Because resolution of inflammation is an active process that includes a network of 
physiologic activities that restore homeostasis of the innate immune system without  
immunosuppression, it is different from anti -inflammation ( Serhan et al, 2014 , Serhan et al, 
2008 ).  Activation of resolution of inflammation has the potential to provide benefit in  CF. 
Activation of resolution of inflammation provides promise for the potential benefit of 
lenabasum in reducing PEx in CF.  Innate immune responses in CF are inherently aberrant, 
with an excessive, persistent and ineffective response to triggers such as infection.  The lungs 
of CF patients are chronically inflamed and an acute increase in inflammation often precedes 
a PEx and a reduction in the acute inflammation generally occurs with resolution of a PEx.   
Treatment with lenabasum is expected to reduce c hronic levels of inflammation in the lungs 
in CF which should provide long -term benefit by reducing the rate of tissue destruction by 
inflammatory processes.  Relevant to the proposed Phase 2 study, when acute inflammation 
is superimposed in the lungs by i nfection or other events, lenabasum is expected to reduce 
the maximum level of acute inflammation achieved and hasten resolution of that 
inflammation without impeding pathogen clearance.  Through these effects in individuals 
with CF, lenabasum is expected to prevent lung inflammation from reaching a level high 
enough to cause signs and symptoms that warrant intervention with antibiotics, that is, a PEx 
(Figure 2).

5.5 Clinical Benefit  of Lenabasum in Completed Trial JBT101 -CF-001 
5.5.1 Design of JBT101 -CF-001 
Data are available from a completed Phase 2 study (JBT101 -CF-001) that evaluated multiple 
doses of lenabasum compared to placebo for safety and efficacy in stable individuals with 
CF.  This double -blinded, randomized, placebo -controlled Phase 2 trial of le nabasum was 
done in 85 stable CF subjects ≥ 18 and < 65 years of age at 21 sites in the US and Europe.

 Key inclusion criteria were FEV1 ≥ 40% predicted, stable baseline CF medications and no 
antibiotic treatment for a PEx within 14 days before Visit 1.  Subjects continued baseline CF 
medications throughout the study including prophylactic antibiotics and CFTR -targeting 
drugs.   
Safety and tolerability of lenabasum was the primary endpoint in this trial.  Pulmonary 
exacerbations treated with IV antibiotics were called out as an event of special interest in the 
primary endpoint, knowing PEx were also a measure of efficacy.  
Subjects were treated with lenabasum 1 mg QD (n = 26), 5 mg QD (n = 24) or placebo QD (n 
= 35) for 4 weeks, then all 51 lenabasum -treated and 10 placebo -treated subjects were 
randomly assigned to receive lenabasum 20 mg QD or 20 mg BID for the next 8 weeks while 
24 placebo -treated subjects continued to receive placebo BID throughout the rest of the 
study.   
Ten subjects discontinued early fr om the study; three withdrew consent; five withdrew due to 
adverse events (AEs), 2 subjects on placebo, 3 subjects on lenabasum; one subject was lost to 
follow -up; two withdrew for treatment -unrelated reasons.  Three AEs that lead to early 
discontinuation were judged related to study drug: 1 placebo subject and 1 lenabasum subject 
each had lack of cognitive clarity and 1 lenabasum subject felt unmotivated.

Characteristics of subjects who had a PEx during study JBT101 -CF-001 were compared to 
those who did not.  Subjects with a PEx had a history of more PEx treated with IV antibiotics 
in the previous year (mean 0.89 versus 0.47).  Hypertonic saline (45% versus  23%), 
azithromycin (55% versus 43%) and inhaled tobramycin (40% versus 19%) were more likely 
to be used in subjects with PEx than those without PEx in JBT101 -CF-001.  Subjects with 
and without PEx had similar treatment with ivacaftor or ivacaftor/lumacaft or (34% versus 
30%).  These findings suggest physicians preferentially prescribe hypertonic saline and 
azithromycin for subjects who are known to their physicians to have more PEx and inhaled 
tobramycin for those who are also infected with pseudomonas, whe reas the prescribe CFTR -
modulating drugs primarily based on subject CFTR genotype rather than risk for PEx.

Evidence of on -target biologic effects of lenabasum were seen in  JBT101 -CF-001.  After 12 
weeks of active treatment lenabasum -treated subjects had reduced total polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, interleukin -8, neutrophil elastase, and 
IgG in sputum compared to placebo -treated subjects , especially with lenabasum 20 mg BID 
dosing ( Figure 6). Lenabasum 20 mg BID also reduced CRP  levels in the blood (not shown).

in Systemic Sclerosis  
5.6.1 Lenabasum Improved Multiple Efficacy Outcomes  in JBT101 -SSc-001 
A double -blind, randomized placebo -controlled 16 -week Phase 2 trial (JBT101 -SSc-001) 
enrolled subjects with diffuse cutaneous SSc ≤ 6 years duration on stable medications 
including immunosuppressive drugs.  Subjects received lenabasum 5 mg QD, 20 mg QD, or  
20 mg BID x 4 weeks, then 20 mg BID x 8 weeks, or placebo x 12 weeks.  Subjects were 
followed off study drug x 4 weeks.  The primary efficacy outcome was American College of 
Rheumatology Combined Response Index in diffuse cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis.  
Forty -two subjects received study drug: lenabasum N = 27 and placebo N = 15.  Baseline 
patient characteristics were similar in both groups.  There were no serious, severe or 
unexpected AEs) related to lenabasum.  Severity and relationship of AEs to study d rug were 
similar in both groups.  AEs in ≥ 10% of lenabasum -treated subjects were dizziness and 
fatigue.  Lenabasum subjects had greater improvement in American College of 
Rheumatology Combined Response Index in diffuse cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis scores 
than placebo -treated subjects over 16 weeks (p = 0.044).  Lenabasum subjects had greater 
improvement and less worsening in modified Rodnan Skin Score, Patient Global Assessment, 
Physician Global Assessment and Health Assessment Questionnaire -Disability Ind ex a 
patient -reported measure of functional disability.  
5.6.2 Lenabasum Improved Biomarkers of Inflammation and Fibrosis in Skin from 
in Subjects in JBT101 -SSc-001 
Evidence of on -target biologic effects of lenabasum also have been demonstrated in systemic 
sclero sis.  Lenabasum -treated subjects showed statistically significant reductions in 
inflammatory cell infiltrates and fibrosis in skin biopsies compared to placebo -treated 
subjects.  They also had statistically significant reduction in gene transcripts in gene  ontology 
pathways of inflammatory response, response to cytokine, extracellular matrix organization 
and collagen metabolism compared to placebo -treated subjects.  
5.7 Safety Profile of Lenabasum  
5.7.1 Overall Safety Profile of Lenabasum  
A comprehensive assessment of  the pharmacological, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological 
effects of lenabasum has been conducted that supports the continued clinical investigation of 
lenabasum in severe, life -threatening indications.  Refer to IB for details.  
When assessing safety risks of lenabasum, it is important to note that CB1 are preferentially 
expressed on neurons, and lenabasum has limited penetration of the blood -brain barrier 
(Dyson et al, 2005 ).  When lenabasum is at steady state concentrati ons in animals, the brain 
concentration is about 30% to 40%  of that in the plasma.  Lenabasum’s greater potency for 
CB2 than CB1, limited penetration of the blood -brain barrier, and a ~100 -fold higher 
expression of CB2 compared to CB1 on activated immune c ells increase the difference 
between exposures that activate CB2 on peripheral immune cells and those that activate CB1 
in the brain.  This difference reduces the risk of untoward effects from activation of CB1 in 
the central nervous system.  To date, lena basum has shown low potential for the development 
of physical dependence in pre -clinical animal models.  In testing in humans, lenabasum has

 shown no psychoactivity using the Addiction Research Center Inventory -Marijuana 
(ARCI -M) questionnaire and Freiburg  List of Complaints, no effect on mood in the Mood 
Scale, and no evidence of attention or cognitive impairment on the Trail Making Test, and at 
therapeutic doses no difference from placebo in the proportion of subjects with psychiatric 
side effects.  
Based on data from animal models of disease and Phase 2 clinical data, the likely therapeutic 
total daily dose range for resolving immune responses and pro -fibrotic processes is 0.5 to 
60 mg.  The therapeutic dose range for lenabasum is below the maximum tolerat ed total daily 
dose of lenabasum in humans of 180 mg.  The dose limiting toxicity of lenabasum is the 
occurrence of several, usually mild, AEs in an individual subject, including combinations of 
dizziness or lightheadedness, fatigue, dry mouth, pallor, hea dache, loss of appetite, nausea, 
orthostatic hypotension, blurred vision, insomnia, somnolence, euphoric mood, inappropriate 
affect, and feeling abnormal or jittery.  Of 29 AEs in 6 subjects who received 240 mg total 
daily dose, which is above the maximum tolerated dose and the top dose administered to 
humans to date, 27 (93%) AEs were mild and 2 (7%) were moderate in severity.  Four 
subjects (67%) had dizziness.   
In the lenabasum clinical development program,  277 subjects have received lenabasum in 
compl eted and unblinded studies. Additionally, an estimated 480 subjects are receiving 
blinded treatment in ongoing studies across the entire development program.  Lenabasum has 
been studied  in healthy subjects, in subjects with refractory neuropathic pain and i n subjects 
with systemic sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, or dermatomyositis . Some subjects enrolled in open -
label extension studies have been receiving study drug for over 2 years.  
Refer to the IB for a detailed description of the lenabasum preclinical safety testing as well as 
the Reference Safety Information.  
5.7.2 Safety of Lenabasum in Cystic Fibrosis in Trial JBT101 -CF-001 
In trial JBT101 -CF-001, 85 subjects were dosed with study med ication; 61  subjects received 
lenabasum and 24  subjects received placebo throughout the trial.  Four out of 61 (6.6%) 
lenabasum -treated subjects withdrew following a TEAE, 2 of which were considered related 
to study drug.  The 2 discontinuations considered  related to lenabasum included lack of 
cognitive clarity (graded mild in severity) and feeling unmotivated (graded moderate in 
severity).  One out of 24 (4.2%) placebo subjects withdrew following TEAE of difficulty 
focusing after taking study product (mild  in severity).  
The majority of reported treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  in lenabasum -treated 
subjects were mild to moderate in severity.   During Week 1 through Week 4, TEAEs  
occurred in 14 subjects (54%) in the lenabasum 1 mg cohort, 13 subjects (54%) in the 
lenabasum 5 mg cohort, and 15 subjects (43%) in the placebo cohort.  During Week 5 
through Week 12, TEAEs occurred in 21 subjects (68%) in the lenabasum 20 mg once per 
day cohort, 19 subjects (63%) in the lenabasum 20 mg BID cohort, and 14 sub jects (58%) in 
the placebo cohort.   
The most common TEAE was mild dry mouth reported by 8 lenabasum subjects (13%) and 
in no placebo subjects.  As expected, the respiratory system was the most common source of 
TEAEs overall.

  Page 41 of 122 
 Nine SAEs occurred in lenaba sum-treated subjects and six SAEs occurred in placebo -
treatment subjects.  None of the SAEs or severe TEAEs were assessed by investigator to be 
related to study drug.  The SAEs comprised 13 pulmonary exacerbations (7 in the lenabasum 
cohort and 6 in the pl acebo cohort), 1 hand  fracture (lenabasum recipient)  and 1 thrombosis 
in a device (lenabasum recipient).  
There were no observed clinically significant treatment effects on vital signs.  Mean BMI 
was comparable in the lenabasum and placebo cohorts at basel ine and at the end of the 16 -
week study.  Triplet ECGs with QT/QTc interval measurements were done throughout the 
study and showed no significant changes from baseline. The ECG findings were similar in 
subjects who received lenabasum and placebo.   Changes from baseline in the ARCI -M test 
were similar in lenabasum - and placebo -treated subjects.   
Laboratory safety testing results showed no clinically significant changes from baseline.  
There was no observed clinically significant difference between lenabasum  and placebo in 
hematology, chemistry, or urinalysis laboratory investigations.  There was no clinically 
relevant reduction in leukocytes or leukocyte subsets.  
Lenabasum achieved the primary objective of the study by demonstrating an acceptable 
safety and tolerability profile at all doses with no serious or severe AEs related to the study 
drug. 
5.7.3 Safety of Lenabasum in Systemic Sclerosis in Trial JBT101 -SSc-001 
In the double -blinded, randomized, placebo -controlled portion  of the Phase 2 trial in SSc, 
there we re 2 treatment -emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), both a consequence of the 
underlying disease and unrelated to study product: one was moderate dehydration following 
an episode of vomiting in an lenabasum -treated subject and one was severe abdominal p ain 
following gastric cryotherapy for vascular ectasias in a placebo -treated subject.  There were 
no severe TEAEs in the lenabasum -treated subjects.  Seventeen (63%) of lenabasum -treated 
subjects had a total of 66 TEAEs, and 9 (60%) of placebo -treated su bjects had a total of 34 
TEAEs .  The severity and relationship of TEAEs to study product in lenabasum -treated 
subjects were like those in placebo -treated subjects. There was 1 discontinuation to a TEAE 
of moderate dizziness in a subject who was receiving len abasum 20 mg once a day.  
Relationship of th at TEAE to study product was probable.  
The most common TEAE in the Phase 2 SSc trial was mild or moderate transient dizziness, 
often described as light -headedness, which occurred in 6 (22%) lenabasum -treated sub jects 
and 2 (13%) placebo -treated subjects.  Mild or moderate fatigue occurred in 5 (19%) of 
lenabasum -treated subjects and 1 (7%) of placebo -treated subject.  There were no observed 
clinically significant treatment effects on vital signs.  Mean body mass index was comparable 
in the lenabasum and placebo cohorts at baseline and at the end of the 16 -week study.  
Assessment of ECGs and corrected QT intervals revealed no clinically significant 
prolongation of corrected QT intervals or other significant ECG fin dings.  Changes from 
baseline in the ARCI -M test were similar in lenabasum - and placebo -treated subjects.   
Laboratory safety testing results showed no clinically significant changes from baseline.  
There was no observed clinically significant difference b etween lenab asum and placebo in 
hematology , chemistry, or urinalysis laboratory investigations.  There was no clinically 
relevant reduction in l eukocytes or leukocyte subsets .

 Trial JBT101 -SSc-001 includes open -label dosing for subjects who completed the d ouble -
blinded placebo -controlled part of the trial.  To date, subjects have received lenabasum 
treatment for a median of 234 days, range 29 -295 days, in both parts of this trial.  With open -
label dosing , subjects received lenabasum 20 mg BID for a median o f 194 days, range 25 -207 
days.  At enrollment into  open -label dosing , 92% of subjects were on concomitant 
immunosuppressive medications.   
There have been no SAEs, severe TEAEs, or TEAEs leading to study discontinuation that 
have been related to lenabasum during open -label dosing  in trial KBT101 -SSc-001.  Of the 
36 enrolled subjects, 28 (78%) have had a least one TEAE during open -label dosing .  Among 
these 28 subjects, the most severe TEAE experienced by an individual subject was unrelated 
to lenabasum in 2 5 (69%) subjects and related to lenabasum in only 3 (8%) of subjects.  The 
most common TEAEs to date have been mild fatigue in 5/26 (14%) subjects and mild or 
moderate upper respiratory illnesses in 4/36 (11%) subjects.  Mild dizziness has occurred in 
only 2/36 (6%) subjects.  
5.7.4 Safety of Lenabasum in Dermatomyositis in Trial JBT101 -DM-001 
Study  JBT101 -DM-001 is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomised Phase 2 study 
being conducted at one centre in the US.  Lenabasum or placebo is administered  at 20 mg 
once  per day for 28 days, escalating  to 20 mg  twice  per day for  an additional 56 days  in 
subjects  with skin-predominant dermatomyositis. To date, 22 subjects have completed dosing 
with study product, and it is estimated that 11 subjects received lenabasum and 11 subjects 
have received placebo .  The unblinded results of the study have not been r eleased.  
• Following reviews of blinded safety data, a Safety Monitoring Committee recommended 
no change to the protocol or safety monitoring plan . 
• There were no serious, severe, or unexpected AEs  in the study .  Most AEs have been 
mild in severity . 
• An open -label extension of the study has started; to date, 21 of 22 eligible  subjects have 
enrolled.  
5.7.5 Pooled Analysis of Adverse Effects  
A pooled analysis  of numbers  and percentages  of subjects with treatment emergent AEs in 
all completed studies  of lenabasum dosing was done,  with AEs summarised by organ  
system  and by dose (see IB for full table).  In these pooled  data, AEs that occurred  in ≥ 
5% of  lenabasum -treated  subjects  were  dizziness (15.4%), nausea (10.1%), dry mouth  
(10.1%), infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (8.2%), upper respiratory tract 
infection (6.7%), fatigue (6.3%), haemoptysis (5.8%), and cough (5.8%).   There were no 
AEs or laboratory abnormalities that indicated immunosuppression or an increase in rate of 
infection.  
The only AE s reported  in ≥ 5% of  placebo -treated subjects  were infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (7.7%) and cough (6.6%) .  (Note that in study JBT101 -CF-
001, adverse events were  collected during the follow -up period, 4 weeks after the end of 
treatment.)

 5.8 Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling to Support Inclusion of 
Subjects 12 -17 Years of Age in JBT101 -CF-002 
To support inclusion of subjects 12 -17 years of age in this Phase 2 trial, a population 
pharmacokinetic model was developed and  all available human exposure data were analyzed. 
Data from two human Phase 1 (CT -3-01/P000029 and CPL7075 -100-01) and two human 
Phase 2 studies (JBT101 -SSc-001 and JBT101 -CF-001) have been used to build and test the 
model.  The pharmacokinetic profile of lenabasum appears well -described by a two -
compartment model with lagged, first -order absorption.  The covariates tested for association 
in this population pharmacokinetic model were population [healthy volunteers general, 
elderly healthy volunteers  (≥68 ye ars old) , CF and SSc ], demographic variables (weight, 
gender, BMI, age, ethnicity and creatinine clearance), co -morbidities (gastroesophageal 
reflux disease and pancreatic insufficiency), food effects, concomitant dedications (proton 
pump inhibitors and pa ncreatic enzymes).  There was no association of body weight with 
lenabasum systemic exposure (i.e., C max or AUC).  
Together with the in vivo  metabolism study results show that lenabasum is minimally 
metabolized in rats, dogs and humans, the pharmacokinetic profile in subjects 12 -17 years of 
age is expected to be similar to that in adults at doses of 5 mg BID and 20 mg BID to be used 
in this trial.  The rationale for this expectation follows.  
Human pharmacokinetic data from prior clinical stud ies show that the relationship between 
dose and systemic exposure is approximately dose -proportional for lenabasum with respect to 
AUC and C max.  As shown in Figure 8 using the p harmacokinetics dataset from the Phase I 
study ( CPL7075 -100-01), exposures were approximately dose proportional for both the 
single and three times per day dosing of lenabasum.  Exposures with BID dose regimen vs. 
AUC 0-24hr of lenabasum were estimated usin g a linear regression analysis.  
Figure 8  Linear Regression of AUC 0-24h vs Lenabasum Dose in Humans  
 
Using this relationship, the dose of lenabasum from 5 -50 mg/dose was extrapolated to 
determine the human exposure of different dosing regimens ( Table 3). Using these figures

Table 5 shows the expected safety factors with lenabasum 5 mg BID and 20 mg BID dosing 
for subjects 12 years of age with weight ≥ 40 kg.  These estimates indicate the predicted 
lenabasum exposures for the 5 mg BID and 20 mg BID doses in subjects 12 years of age an d 
weight 40 kg will be ≥ 4.3-fold and ≥ 1. 9-fold, respectively,  below the systemic AUC 
exposure at NOAELs determined in 26-week  rat and 39-week  dog toxicology studies.  Based 
on the lack of significant accumulation observed after dosing in animals and huma ns, no 
accumulation of lenabasum with BID dosing is expected in subjects 12 years of age with 
body weight ≥ 40 kg.  The safety factors shown in Table 5 should be representative of BID 
dosing in subjects 12 years of age and weight ≥ 40 kg.

Thus, th e expected exposure to lenabasum for subjects 12 -17 years of age with weight ≥ 40

acceptable safety profile and have been well tolerated to date.

 5.9 Potential Risks and Ben efits 
Lenabasum is a novel synthetic oral agonist of cannabinoid  receptors that activates the 
endocannabinoid system.  It selectively binds and activates CB2 compared to CB1.  
Lenabasum activates naturally occurring pathways to resolve active innate immune  responses 
and pro -fibrotic processes.  Lenabasum’s selective potency for CB2 than CB1, limited 
penetration of the blood -brain barrier, and preferential expression of CB2 versus CB1 on 
activated immune cells increases the therapeutic window.  
In nonclinica l testing, lenabasum inhibits production of TNFα  and IL-6 and reduces mRNA 
levels of transcription factor XBP -1 by CF lung macrophages .  Lenabasum significantly 
inhibits inflammation in a mouse model of CF lung inflammation induced by infection with 
P. aer uginosa .  Lenabasum inhibits inflammation and fibrosis of the lungs and skin in 
bleomycin -induced murine models.  In completed Phase 2 testing  in CF in JBT101 -CF-001, 
lenabasum demonstrated evidence of clinical benefit with a reduction in PEx.  This clinical 
finding was supported by biomarker data that showed reduction inflammatory cells and 
mediators in sputum. Similarly, in completed Phase 2 testing in systemic sclerosis in 
JBT101 -SSc-001, lenabasum showed consistent evidence of clinical b enefit  across multiple 
efficacy outcomes, often reaching and occasionally exceeding minimum important 
difference.  Mechanism of action testing in JBT101 -SSc-001 showed that lenabasum has 
significant and inh ibitory effects on inflammation and fibrosis in the skin and gene transcript 
pathways associated with disease processes.  
Lenabasum is being developed as a chronic oral therapy, self -administered either once or 
twice a day, for treatment of the serious and rare or uncommon diseases such as CF, SSc, 
dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus, disease s characterized by pathologic 
immune responses and often excessive pro-fibrotic processes.   
5.9.1 Potential Risks  
Nonclinical toxicology and toxicokinetic studie s support further clinical testing at the doses 
of lenabasum that are administered in clinical studies.  As anticipated, clinical signs 
consistent with a CB1 effect on the central nervous system were seen at high doses in single 
and repeat dose studies in animals.  There were no clinical or anatomical pathology changes 
or treatment -related microscopic findings indicating organ toxicity in any of the repeat dose 
studies.  The ages of rats receiving lenabasum treatment were as young as 38 days at the start 
of the twice -daily dosing in a 13 -week repeat dose study in rats.  The human -equivalent age 
of these rats appropriately covered the target adolescent ages (≥12 years).  In reproductive 
and development studies in rats  and/or rabbits , no effects of treatment w ere seen on fertility 
and fetal external, visceral, and skeletal evaluations , indicating a lack of developmental 
toxicity .  Lenabasum was not mutagenic or clastogenic in genotoxicity studies.  In several  
animal studies  (rats and dogs) , handling -induced con vulsions (seizures) have been observed 
while lenabasum was administered for 3 -6 months  (i.e. chronic treatment)  at or slightly above  
clinically relevant exposure levels . However, in all human studies to date, no convulsions  
have been reported by subjects t aking lenabasum. In an animal experiment specifically 
designed to look for potential of lenabasum to cause seizures, lenabasum did not increase the 
the seizure -threshold for  chemically -induced seizures.  Lenabasum has shown low potential 
for abuse in precli nical testing in rats. Testing with human biomaterials shows that 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 46 of 122 
 lenabasum is tightly bound to plasma proteins (≥  97%) and shows no cytochrome P450 
inhibition at pharmacological drug levels.  
Anticipated AEs in clinical trials with lenabasum include those related to the disease being 
studied, concomitant medicatio ns that subjects may be taking , AEs caused by lenabasum, and 
common AEs in the general population.  The potential benefits are a reduction in PEx and 
improvement from baseline in lung function and patient -reported outcomes in CF.   Evidence 
of this clinical benefit was seen  in the completed Phase 2 study JBT101 -CF-001 (Section  
5.5.3 ).   
Adverse events that occur in a general population are expected in any clinical study with 
lenabasum.  These AEs would include events such as mild changes in vital signs, sore 
throats, mil d skin, upper or lower respiratory tract or genitourinary infections, some of which 
may require topical or oral antibiotics, asymptomatic bacteriuria, headaches, nausea, 
vomiting, mild rashes, accidents, and mild  to moderate  abnormalities in laboratory tes ting of 
complete blood count testing, platelets, differential cell counts, metabolic panels including 
liver function tests and electrolytes, and urinalyses.  
CB1/CB2 agonists can produce AEs in humans, and many of these are probably caused by 
the activation  of central CB1 rather than of CB2 or peripheral CB1.  Adverse effects most 
often observed in previous clinical trials with CB1/CB2 agonists have been dizziness/light -
headedness, dry mouth, tiredness/fatigue, muscle weakness, myalgia (muscle pain) and 
palpitations ( Pertwee, 2009 ).  Other less frequently reported side effects of CB1/CB2 
agonists include disorientation, feeling of drunkenness, ‘high sensation’, mental clouding, 
altered time perception, impairment of memory or a bility to concentrate, tremor, balance 
impairment or lack of coordination, nausea/feeling sick, vomiting, hypotension, blurred 
vision, constipation or diarrhea, confusion, dysphoria/depression, disorientation, paranoia and 
hallucinations ( Pertwee, 2009 ).  Any of these AEs could be expected with lenabasum 
exposure.  There have been no significant differences between lenabasum and placebo in 
tests of psychoactivity or in rate of psychiatric AEs in the clinical trials.   
Some AE s associated with CB1/CB2 agonists have been observed in subjects exposed to 
lenabasum and future subjects are at risk for the AEs listed in the IB.  The frequency and 
severity of AEs have been dose -related.  The most common adverse reaction observed in 
reported lenabasum studies is dizziness, often described as light -headedness, that is usually 
mild and transient.  Dizziness occurred in only 1/85 subjects in the completed Phase 2 CF 
study.  
Laboratory safety testing results have shown no clinically significant changes from baseline.  
Assessment of ECG and corrected QT intervals in triplet ECGs at the time of Cmax in CF and 
SSc subjects revealed no clinically significant prolongation of correc ted QT intervals or other 
significant ECG findings.   
Studies of human reproduction have not been performed with lenabasum. It is not known if 
lenabasum can cause fetal harm  when administered to pregnant women or if it can  negatively 
affect  reproductive  capacity.  Women of  childbearing potential (WOCBP) should not be 
pregnant or breastfeeding at the start of the study  and should avoid becoming pregnant during 
the study and for at least 28 days after the last dose of the study product.   
Refer to the IB for additional safety information about lenabasum.

 5.9.2 Potential Benefits  
Lenabasum has not been approved for any indication anywhere.   
In the two Phase 2 studies (JBT101 -CF-001 and JBT101 -SSc-001) where efficacy has been 
assessed, positive efficacy results were noted.  A n analgesic signal was seen in the refractory 
neuropathic pain trial at total daily doses up to 80 mg.  In the 16 -week study in CF, 
lenabasum provided clinical benefit as assessed by time to PEx and event rate of PEx.  
Based on findings of clinical benefit in Phase 2 testing in CF, efficacy of lenabasum will be 
measured in this study  JBT101 -CF-002; however, no benefits are claimed for  the individuals 
who choose to participate.  The information that will come from this study will address the 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, and plasma concentrations and metabolites of lenabasum in 
subjects ≥ 12 years of age with  CF. 
5.9.3 Risk -Benefit Conclusi ons 
Overall, lenabasum has been found to be well -tolerated in studies conducted to date with only 
mild or moderate adverse reactions observed.  The most common adverse reaction consistent 
with the pharmacological action of lenabasum during placebo -controll ed dosing has been  
mild dry mouth in CF and  mild/moderate dizziness  in SSc . In the dose range applicable to 
currently conducted and planned clinical trials, there was a lower frequency of AEs overall 
and of AEs of  central nervous system  effects than at dos es higher than the anticipated 
therapeutic range.   
Positive efficacy results have been noted in the  completed Phase 2  CF, SSc and neuropathic 
pain trials.  Results from preclinical safety, toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies, efficacy 
studies in animal models of disease, studies with human biomaterials, and safety, 
pharmacokinetic, and mechanism of action studies to date in humans support a favorable 
benefit -risk profile of lenabasum  in CF .  
These data justify its continuing investigation in clinical tri als in rare and serious diseases 
with significant unmet medical need, such as cystic fibrosis .

 7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN AND METHODS  
7.1 Study Design and Plan Description  
This is a multicenter, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group 
assessment of efficacy and safety of 28 weeks of treatment of CF patients with lenabasum  20 
mg BID and lenabasum 5 mg BID . 
7.1.1 Study Schematic  
 
R = randomization; V = Visit ; N = number of subjects; BID = twice daily  
7.1.2 Study Population  
The target population is males and females with CF ≥ 12 years of age with FEV1 ≥ 40% 
predicted and < 100% predicted within 12 months before  screening  and who have h ad 2 to 3 
PEx treated with IV antibiotic therapy within 12 months before  screening or as an alternative, 
1 PEx treated with IV antibiotics and at least 1 PEx treated with oral antibiotics in the last 12 
months before  screening . 
Target enrollment is 415 eligible subjects.   Assuming a screen failure rate of ~15%, ~ 490 
subjects will be screened to identify a target of 415 eligible subjects who will be enroll ed at 
up to ~100 multi -national sites.  Assuming a ~15% drop -out rate, ~ 352 subjects will 
complete the study.  
7.1.3 Screening  
Screening  can occur up to 28 days before Visit 1. Refer to Section 7.2.3  for the detailed list 
of screening assessments  and Sections 7.2.4  and 7.2.5 , respectively, for inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  A subject that has s creen failed may re -screen at a later date at the 
discretion of the site investigator.  A new subject code will be allocated at re -screening.  
7.1.4 Duration of the Study  
The screening period is up to 4 weeks before Visit 1.

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 52 of 122 
 Active dosing with study drug is 28 weeks.  There will be 8 scheduled study visits during 
active dosing with study drug, labeled Visits 1 -8, which occur at Visit  1 and at the 
completion of Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28.  
Subjects who complete Visit 8 on study drug will have a Safety Foll ow-up Visit labeled Visit 
9 at 28 (± 7) days after Visit 8 . 
Subjects who discontinue early from the study drug and do not withdraw consent will be 
asked to return for off -treatment safety an d efficacy assessments at Visit  5 and Visit 8, as 
applicable.  Otherwise, they will return 28 (± 7) days  after the last dose of study drug for a 
Safety Follow -up Visit that is identical to Visit 9  assessments . 
All subjects who develop acute signs and symptoms of worsening lung disease will be asked 
to return to the site for evaluation at a Possible PEx Visit  (assessments detailed in Section 
10.2.6 ). 
Unscheduled Visits may be necessary to assess the subject for safety purposes unrelated to 
new respiratory symptoms or a PEx.  
During Visit 8 (or ET) subjects may be asked to participate in a two -year observational safety 
follow -up study. Subjects who agree to participate in the follow -up study will be consented 
under a sepa rate protocol.  
All scheduled visits after Visit  1 are ± 1 week.  
See Section 10.2 for the timing and description of protocol procedures scheduled for  each 
visit.  
The start of the study is defined as the first subject’s first visit. The end of the study is 
defined as the last subject’s last visit. 
7.1.5 Blinding  
Dosing will be done in a double -blinded, randomized, placebo -controlled manner.  Refer to 
Section 8.6 for blinding methods and rationale.  
7.1.6 Treatment  Groups , Allocation  and Dose Adjustment  
7.1.6.1  Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized centrally to treatment assignment before dosing .  Randomization 
will be stratified by factors that influence risk of PEx in the next 6 months or may be 
associated with dif ferences in standard -of-care including treatment with CFTR -targeting 
treatments: number of previous PEx requiring IV antibiotics in the previous year (1 versus  2 
or 3), FEV1 % predicted at baseline (< 70% versus ≥ 70% predicted) and location of site 
(Unite d States versus Canada  and Europe).  
Treatment groups are:  
● Cohort 1:   lenabasum 20 mg BID (n = 166) 
● Cohort 2:  lenabasum 5 mg BID (n = 83) 
● Cohort 3:  placebo BID (n = 166).

 Twice per day dosing consists of a dose in the morning and a dose in the evenin g.  Ideally 
doses should  be about 12 hours apart and at a minimum there should be at least 8 hours 
between any 2 doses.  Subjects will self -administer study drug , which will be taken orally  
and with no requirement as to fed or fasting state.  Refer t o Section 8 for the description of 
the formulation and presentation of the study drug s. 
7.1.6.2  Dose Adjustment  
To potentially reduce drop -out rates from A Es or tolerability issues during the study, the 
treating physician may choose to reduce the dose of study drug  by 1 capsule  per day  for 
safety or tolerability reasons,  but only after discussion with the Medical Monitor  about the 
safety or tolerability reasons .  The reason s for this physician decision will be documented in 
the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Criteria leading to a permanent reduction from 
BID to QD dosing of study medications include:  
• The occurrence of AEs that are persistent or recurrent over at least 2 weeks AND  
• Are at least moderate in severity AND  
• Are probably - or definitely -related to study medication AND  
• In the absence of dose reduction, would lead to permanent discontinuation of stu dy 
product or discontinuation from the study AND  
• All permanent dose reductions require prior Medical Monitor approval  
For clarity, it is the intended that the subject remains on BID dosing throughout the study.  
The above criteria are to be used only if th e subject will otherwise discontinue the study 
product or the study.  
The impact of any reduction in dose will be assessed in sensitivity analyses of efficacy 
outcomes.  See Section 7.2.8  for guidelines for interruption or discontinuation of dosing.  
7.1.7 Efficacy Assessments  
Refer to Section 9.1 for the definition of efficacy variables and description of efficacy 
assessments and Section 10 for the tabulation and detailed listing of efficacy assessments 
scheduled at each visit.  The following efficacy assessments will be done:  
• Antibiotic use for respiratory signs and symptoms  questionnaire ( AUR -Q) at screening, 
Visits 1 - 9 and Possible PEx Visits  
• Spirometry at screening, Visits 1 - 9 and Possible PEx Visits  
• CRISS questionnaires at screening, Visits 1 -9 and Possible PEx Visits  
• BMI at screening, Visits 1 - 9 and Possible PEx Visits  
• CFQ -R questionnaire at s creening, Visit 1, Visit 5,  Visit 8 and Possible PEx Visits  
• Biomarkers in blood and sputum at Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 5, Visit 8 and Possible PEx 
Visits  
• Common CF pathogens in sputum at Visit 1, Visit 5, Visit 8 and Possible PEx Visits.  
7.1.8 Safety Assessments  
See Section 9.2 for the definition of safety variables and description of safety assessments 
and Section 10 for the tabulation and detailed listing of safety assessments scheduled at each 
visit.  The following safety assessments will be done:

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 54 of 122 
 • Concomitant medications/vaccinations from screening until the subject completes or 
discontinues from the study  
• AEs including SAEs at screening and Visits 1 -9, Possible PEx Visits, and Unscheduled 
Visits  
• Vital signs consisting of systolic and diastolic bloo d pressure (BP), pulse rate (P), 
respiratory rate (R), body temperature (T), weight, height, and O 2 saturation at screening 
and Visits 1 -9, Possible PEx Visits, and Unscheduled Visits.  Body mass index (BMI) 
will be calculated centrally  
• Laboratory safety t ests at screening and Visits 1 -9 and as indicated during Possible PEx 
Visits and Unscheduled Visits  
• ECGs questionnaire will be completed by subjects at Visit 1 before and 3 ± 0.5 hours 
after administration of the first study drug dose, at Visit 5 and at Vi sit 8.  
7.1.9 Data Collection  
Remote data entry will be done using eCRF .  Certain data will be recorded directly into 
eCRFs to facilitate web -based adjudication .  Refer to Section 13.1 for description of source 
data and record keeping.   
7.1.10  Discussion of Study Design and Control Group  
The study is being conducted in the target population of subjects with confirmed CF  which is 
the indication under investigation.  Subjects at higher risk of PEx during the study period will 
be enrolled  which reduces sample size and facilitates testing over 6 months rather than a 
year.   
Based on resolution of inflammation and improved bacterial cle arance, lenabasum is 
expected to reduce the number and severity of PEx.  This efficacy will be assessed in primary 
and secondary efficacy outcomes  that measure and define PEx in several different ways .  On -
target activity of lenabasum in the lungs showing modification of the underlying disease 
process of lung inflammation in CF will be assessed during the study as a secondary efficacy 
outcome.  
The double -blind design and random assignment to treatment in this study provide stringent 
methods of elimination o f bias in the planned assessments of efficacy and safety variables.  
This study is multicenter and placebo -controlled.   
Cystic fibrosis is a variable disease in its manifestations and outcomes.  A matching placebo 
will be used to provide the benchmark for comparison to lenabasum during this 
intervention al study  design .  To minimize safety risk, lenabasum  and placebo treatments will 
be given in addition to standard -of-care treatment s the subject is  receiving.   
Subjects 12-17 years of age who weigh at least 40 kg will be enrolled.  These subjects will be 
at significantly higher risk of recurrent PEx and decline in lung function near -term than other 
adolescents with CF.  Based on modeling of pharmacok inetic data, exposure in these subjects 
12-17 years of age at the higher dose of lenabasum is 20 mg BID will be  lower than the 
NOAEL in animal toxicology studie s, including toxicology studies in adolescent rats.   The 
safety profile to lenabasum in 248 subjects as of May 2017  including subjects with CF has 
been acceptable with no severe or serious AEs related to lenabasum.  The efficacy results 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 55 of 122 
 from the completed Phase 2 study in adults with CF offers potential for clinical benefit in 
these subjects 12 -17 ye ars of age with high unmet medical need .  
7.1.10.1  Justification of dose  
The maximum dose of Lenabasum to be used in this study is 40 mg per day (administered as 
20 mg BID). This dose level has been administered in CF patients in a prior study as reported 
in Sectio n 5 of this document, where it was well tolerated and demonstrated an acceptable 
risk benefit profile. Overall lenabasum has been administered to 299 subjects in doses 
ranging from 1 mg to 240 mg  with duration of dosing ranging from a single dose to over one 
year of dosing  (DSUR data lock point 05 March 2018) . The data generated to date supports 
progression of 20 mg BID dose as likely efficacious dose.  
The lower dose level of 5 mg BID is being in vestigated to profile the dose response and is 
projected to be less efficacious than the 20 mg BID dose level.  
Justification for th ese doses in subjects aged 12 – 17 is provided in Section 5.8. 
7.2 Selection of Study Population  
7.2.1 Target Population  
The target population is subjects with documented CF who  are at least 12 years of age  and 
are at high  risk for PEx in the next 6 months.  
7.2.2 Definition of Pulmonary Exacerbation and Related Terms  
For this study, the following definitions will be used:  
PEx definition for primary endpoint:  
• Physician diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation  
• Prescription of n ew oral, intravenous or inhaled antibiotics (regularly given prophylactic 
antibiotics do not count as new antibiotic unless the dose is increased , or given off 
schedule ). 
• At least 4 out of 12 Fuch’s criteria  are met. 
Note: For a new exacerbation event, there needs to be a t least 28 -day gap from last use of 
antibiotics to the new antibiotics (regularly given prophylactic antibiotics do not count to 
determine the gap) . The 28 -day gap will be counted centrally  for efficacy analysis . 
Seco ndary definition of PEx: 
• Physician diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation . 
• New antibiotics - oral, intravenous or inhaled , with same 28 -day gap as above from the 
last antibiotic use . 
Start day of a new PEx  
The day the physician initiates antibiotic treatment f or the new PEx.  
Stop day of a new PEx  
The last day of antibiotic treatment for a new PEx.

  Page 56 of 122 
 Time to first pulmonary exacerbation  
Days from the first dose of study drug to the day a physician initiates systemic antibiotic(s) 
for the first new PEx after enroll ment.  
Early Rapid Responder  
Early rapid responders will be defined in several ways including but not limited to achieving 
a certain degree of improvement in FEV1 , improvement  in CRISS score , and improvement of 
other related  measurements  within a  certain period of time.   
 
7.2.3 Screening  Assessments  
Subjects will be recruited from clinics run by the investigators or at which the investigators 
participate.  See Section 7.2.7  for a description of recruitment strategies.  Written informed 
consent/assent will be obtained before any study -related procedure is performed for a subject.  
After obtaining written informed  consent/assent, eligibility for study enrollment will be 
assessed using the protocol -defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.    
7.2.4 Inclusion Criteria

f. Serum transaminase (s) > 2.5 x upper normal limit  
8. Any other condition or concurrent medical therapy at screening or Visit 1 that causes the 
investigator to determine it is not safe for the subje ct to participate or that may influence 
response to study drug or interfere with study assessments.  
When in doubt about whether a subject meets an eligibility criterion, the investigator or 
designee  should discuss the situation with the Medical Monitor.  
7.2.6 Women, Minorities, and Children (Special Populations)  
Women and minorities will be recruited.  Because the incidences of CF in people of African, 
African American, Hispanic, and Asian ancestry are lower than in people of Central or 
Northern European ancest ry, it is expected that their percentages in this study will be lower 
than their representation in the general population of Central Europe, Northern Europe and 
North America .  However, the percentages of women and minorities in the study are 
expected to r eflect their percentages in the CF eligible populations in Central Europe, 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 59 of 122 
 Northern Europe, and the US.  Urban sites will be included, to increase opportunities to 
enroll minority subjects.   
Subjects 12 -17 years of age  will be recruited.  Because of the r equirements for a certain 
number of PEx in the previous 12 months and the relative infrequency of PEx in children 
compared to adults, it is expected that about 15 -20% of subjects will be subjects 12 -17 years 
of age . 
7.2.7 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
The target enrollment is 415 eligible subjects.  Most subjects will be recruited from the 
clinics run by the investigators or at which the investigators participate.  A need to advertise 
for subjects outside the sites is not anticipated, although it is ac ceptable.   
To encourage retention in the study, every effort will be made to be respectful of the 
subject’s time.  The total time required from the subject for study visits will vary with the 
efficiency of each site and is expected to be 15 to 22 hours pl us travel time  over 32 weeks .   
Subjects will be encouraged to stay in the study at each visit by study personnel and 
reminded of the date and time of their next visit.  If the subject agrees, e -mail or text message 
reminders of visits also will be sent.  
To reduce missing data, subjects who discontinue study drug  for reasons of safety or 
tolerability will be asked to return for Visit 5, if they have not already had it, and Visit 8 to 
collect off -treatment safety and efficacy data.  These off -treatment safet y and efficacy data 
will be included in data analyses.  
7.2.8 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment  
7.2.8.1  Interruption of Dosing in an Individual Subject  
The intent is to continue study drug  during any PEx.  
Interruption of continued dosing in individual subjects may occur for safety reasons and at 
the discretion of the investigator  or Medical Monitor, if it is felt that interruption of dosing is 
in the best interest of the subject.  Other than in urgent situa tions, it is recommended that the 
investigator discuss the reasons for interruption of dosing with the Medical Monitor, before  
interruption.  
Multiple on -off periods of treatment with s tudy drug are permitted if in the best medical 
interest of the subject according to the  investigator.  The Medical Monitor may contact the 
investigator  to discuss appropriateness of continuing an individual subject in the trial because 
of multiple on -off periods, for example, if the subject exceeds more than 14 days off study  
drug. 
If there is interruption  of the drug , the original visit schedule should be followed, therefore it 
is expected that with interruption(s), total treatment duration in an individual patient will be 
less than 28 weeks.  
7.2.8.2  Individual subject’s withdrawal f rom the study  
Lost to follow -up: If a subject does not return for scheduled study visits, at least 3 attempts 
will be made to contact the subject by phone by site staff.  A certified letter to update him/her 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 60 of 122 
 on the study status will also be sent following the third attempted phone contact.  If the 
subject does not respond to these attempts, he/she will be considered lost to follow -up.  
Withdrawal of consent  for the  study  participation : An individual subject who withdraws 
consent will not receive any further study drug or evaluation after consent is withdrawn.  For 
the subjects who discontinue  the treatment, but do not withdraw consent, refer to Section 
7.2.8.3 . 
7.2.8.3  Discontinuation of Dosing in an Individual Subject  
An individual subject will have study drug permanently discontinued before completion of 
Visit 8 if any of the following occur in the subject in question:  
● Lost to follow -up 
● Withdrawal of consent  for the study participation  
● Pregnancy  
● Any serious  or life -threatening  TEAE probably or definitely -related  to lenabasum  
● Any AE , which in the opinion of investigator , can jeopardize the safety of an individual 
subject  
● Subject ’s decision to discontinue treatment  
Subjects lost to follow up or who withdraw consent for the study  participation will be 
handled as per Section 7.2.8.2 . 
Subjects who are withdrawn d ue to pregnancy will be followed per the procedures outlined in 
Pregnancies, Section 9.2.6.8 . 
Participants who are discontinued permanently from study drug  due to a serious or life -
threatening TE AE will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event.  Subjects 
withdrawn for any of the above reasons except lost to follow -up will be evaluated at the time 
of their withdrawal ( Visits 2 -7 or an  unscheduled visit).  Unless consent is withdrawn or the 
subject is lost to follow -up, subjects who have study drug permanently discontinued 
prematurely will be asked to return for Visit 5 (if they have not already had Visit 5 ) and Visit 
8, for assessment of PEx and other efficacy and safety endpoints.  If they decline, they will 
be asked to return for a Safety Follow -up Visit 28 ± 7 days after the last dose of study drug.   
If it is a subject ’s decision to discontinue treatmen t, the subject will be asked for the reason, 
and if it is due to an adverse event, it should be marked as discontinuation due to adverse 
event.  Subjects who discontinue study product (but do not withdraw consent) may be asked 
to participate in a two -year observational safety follow -up. Subjects who agree to participate 
in the follow -up study will be consented under a separate protocol.  
The investigator or designee  must enter the information about discontinuation of treatment in 
the electronic data capture ( EDC) system.  Study drug will be stopped without tapering or 
adding additional treatments.  All remaining study drug must be returned to site staff.  
Abrupt discontinuation of treatment with lenabasum has not been shown to cause any 
harmful effects  although  any clinical benefit from treatment such as protection from PEx may 
be lost when treatment is stopped .

 Narratives will be generated for all patients who discontinue the study drug early for any 
reason.  
7.2.8.4  Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study  
This study may be suspended or prematurely terminated by Corbus independently or at the 
request of a regulatory authority, with sufficient reasonable cause.  Written notification, 
documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided b y Corbus to 
the regulatory authority  and the  investigators .  If the study is suspended or prematurely 
terminated, the investigator will promptly inform his/her EC and will provide the reason(s) 
for the suspension or termination.  Review and approval by an investigator’s EC and possibly 
the country regulatory agency is required for resumption of the study at that site in the event 
the study is interrupted because of any of the events listed below.   
If any of the following events occur during the enrollment period , study entry and 
randomization of new subjects into the study will be suspended until expedited review of the 
event in question occurs by the independent, unblinded DMC: 
• Death in any subject judged to be probably or definitely -related  to lenabasum  
• A life-threatening clinical event judged to be probably or definitely  related  to 
lenabasum.  NOTE:  The term ‘life -threatening’ refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have cause d death, if it w as more severe . 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects that 
contraindicates dosing of additional subjects, in the opinion of the Chief Medical 
Officer of Corbus . 
• Any in formation about the execution of the trial that in the opinion of the Chief 
Medical Officer of Corbus contraindicates further study entry and randomization of 
new subjects.  Possible reasons for termination of the study could be, but are not 
limited to, th e following: unsatisfactory enrollment with respect to quantity or quality; 
insufficient adherence to protocol requirements; data that are not sufficiently 
complete and/or evaluable to interpret study results; falsification of records; or 
determination of futility  of demonstrating efficacy .   
Administration of study drug  may continue during the time of review in subjects who are 
already receiving study drug  at the discretion of the Chief Medical Officer of Corbus.   
An expedited and cumulative review of saf ety data and the circumstances of the event(s) in 
question will be conducted by the DMC  with additional external expertise as needed to make 
recommendations to Corbus whether screening , randomization, and/or dosing can resume or 
should be discontinued, whe ther the protocol should be modified or whether the study should 
be discontinued permanently.  The study can be discontinued permanently by Corbus  upon 
consideration of a cumulative review of safety and other data .   
7.2.9 Replacement Policy  
Subjects will not be replaced.

 8 STUDY PRODUCT  
8.1 Dosage, Preparation, and Administration  
No onsite preparation or masking of clinical supplies is required by site personnel.  Study 
drugs are powder -in-capsules of lenabasum 20 mg, lenabasum 5 mg and placebo.  
Study drug will be d ispensed at Visit 1 according to randomization schedule and the subject 
will take the first dose of study drug at the site .  Subjects will be observed at the site for at 
least 30 minutes following the first dose of study drug.  Thereafter, s ubjects will 
self-administer study drug, which will be taken by the oral route BID with at least 8 hours 
between the two doses .   
The study drug must be taken per the following regimen:  
● Capsules should be swallowed whole  
● Ideally, morning and evening doses will be about 12 hours apart.  Morning and evening 
doses should  be at least 8 hours apart  
● If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon a s possible on the same day.  If it is missed 
for the entire day, it should not be made up  
● Doses can be taken without regard to fed state  
● Subjects who take more than the prescribed dose of study drug  should be instructed to 
contact site staff  immediately an d to seek emergency medical care, if needed.  
8.2 Study Medication Supply  
After ensuring the subject meets eligibility criteria, the investigator  or designee  will request 
subject randomization by an interactive web -based randomization system (IWRS) generally 
4-7 days before first dose of study drug .  After randomization, IWRS will generate an e -mail 
to Corbus’ distributor of the study drug  and request shipment of the correct study drug  and 
dose if needed .  Study drug  will be shipped to the site pharmacy or investigator  before  Visit 
1.  Certain sites at the beginning of the study may have a supply of study drug on site to 
facilitate dosing of the first subjects entered.  
Study drug  will be supplied in bottles of 35 caps ules, corresponding to treatment assi gnment.  
Each bottle will be numbered, and the sites will receive instructions which bottles and kits to 
dispense to which subject and when, ba sed on treatment assignment.  Two study bottles will 
contain a 28 -day supply  of study drug  (BID dosing) plus packaged overage to allow 
treatment to continue for up to seven extra days, in case of unexpected and unavoidable 
delays in follow -up visit.  For clarity, study visits are expected to occur on the stipulated day 
with minima l variation.  
The overage will be collected before  dispensing the next 28 -day supply of study drug .  No 
study drug will be distributed unless the subject returns unused study drug , when applicable 
for a given visit .  In exceptional circumstances, based on his/her judgment, the investigator  
can authorize dispensing the next 28 -day supply of study drug  in the absence of returning the 
unused overage from the previous 28 days.  If a subject should fail to return overage at the 
designed visit, that overage can b e collected at the next visit.  If not previously collected, all 
unreturned overage must be collected on Visit 9.

Pharmaceutical s, Inc. ’s name and the quantity of drug contained.   Additional labels must not 
cover the caution label or the name of the manufacturer.  
8.6 Masking and Unblinding  
8.6.1 Masking Procedures  
Lenabasum and placebo capsules will have similar physical appearance and will be 
packaged, labeled and handled so that subjects and site staff  are not able to distinguish 
between the two.  Identical assessments and  procedures will be followed during the study for 
subjects assigned to lenabasum and placebo cohorts .  
This study is double -blinded. The blinding of the trial must be maintained throughout the trial 
until all data entry and processing are complete and the database has been locked.  Except for 
emergency unblinding (see Section 8.6.2 ), all Corbus medical and clinical operations staff 
associated with th is study, both internal Corbus staff and CRO staff, and including the 
Medical Monitor, project management, and site monitors, will remain blinded to treatment 
randomization until the study is completed and the database is closed.   
Study subjects and the s ite staff, including the investigators who will do safety and clinical 
assessments, designee s, study nurses, and study coordinators will be blinded to intervention 
groups during the study.  The final unblinding of all study participants will occur only aft er 
the data analysis set has been locked.  If the treatment allocation for a subject otherwise 
becomes known to the investigator  or other clinical site staff, the investigator or designee  
must notify Corbus immediately.  
Corbus clinical supply and logistics services personnel will be unblinded to the study drug  
randomization.  They are required not to reveal randomization information to others, unless a 
formal unblinding of information for a given subject is undertaken for safety  reasons.

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 64 of 122 
 A limited number of contract laboratory personnel who will perform and interpret assays 
such as lenabasum concentrations may be unmasked during the study.  These results will be 
provided to the Medical Monitor and other clinical personnel asso ciated with the study using 
dummy subject identifications until the database is locked.  Certain data management, 
programming, biostatistician, and pharmacokinetics personnel at Corbus may be unmasked. 
These unmasked Corbus personnel will not be associated  with the clinical conduct of the 
study and will not reveal to any clinical personnel involved in the study the treatment to 
which a subject is assigned.  
8.6.2 Unblinding Procedures  
8.6.2.1  Emergency Unblinding Procedures  
To maintain the overall quality of data collecte d during of the study, breaks in blinding 
during the conduct of the study should occur only in exceptional circumstances when 
knowledge of the actual treatment is essential for further management of the subject .  
Unblinding of the study drug for an individ ual can be done during the study period in the 
case of:  
● A medical emergency or SUSAR where knowledge of the treatment assignment is 
necessary to treat the subject  
● A child accidentally takes the study drug .   
Unblinding will occur only in situations that also call for study drug discontinuation in an 
individual subject.  
In the event of a safety concern that requires unblinding of treatment assignment for an 
individual subject, the investigators will have 24 -hour access to an IWRS through which the 
code ca n be broken for that subject.  Systematic procedures for unblinding through the IWRS 
will be described in a manual supplied to the site.  In all circumstances other than a medical 
emergency, unblinding will be done only by the Medical Monitor, and only aft er discussion 
with the requesting investigator. In an emergency, investigator will be able to unblind the 
subject, but should discuss with the medical monitor as soon as feasible.  
Emergency unblinding must be reported to the Medical Monitor immediately.  W hen it is 
necessary to break the blind, the investigator  must notify the EC.  Corbus will be notified 
through the IWRS regarding the unblinding, and Corbus will notify the other investigator s 
with the reasons for unblinding , if applicable .  
The subject wil l have either a routine scheduled visit if due or an unscheduled visit as soon as 
possible related to emergency unblinding with appropriate testing and follow -up thereafter to 
evaluate the safety concern that caused the emergency unblinding.   Unless consen t is 
withdrawn, the subject will be asked to return for Visit 5 and Visit 8, as applicable.  
After emergency unblinding, the investigator  should  not disclose  the treatment assignment to 
the subject or  other study personnel  until after database lock and disclosure of treatment 
assignment to all patients.    
8.6.2.2  Unblinding Procedures at the End of the Study  
After study completion when all the data are collected, all queries have been resolved, the 
DMC has had its final review of t he safety data and the database has been locked, then the 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 65 of 122 
 lead statistician will generate a request to the IWRS to break the treatment code for all 
subjects for purposes of data analyses.  This will be done to determine the effect of 
lenabasum when all the  data are present.   
After the treatment code has been broken for the study, the investigator s will be notified by e -
mail that they or their designee s can obtain the treatment code for individual subjects at their 
own sites.  The investigator s will be aske d to inform subjects of their blinded treatment 
allocation, if the subjects choses to know  and EC requirements for disclosure, if any, have 
been met . 
8.7 Conditions for Storage and Use  
Bottles of study drug  are to be stored at the site at room temperature away  from temperature 
and humidity extremes.  In the US, storage conditions must be appropriate for small 
quantities of Controlled Drugs Act Schedule 1 substances.  In the US, study drug  that is 
returned by the subjects to the site will be stored under conditi ons appropriate for small 
quantities of Controlled Drugs Act Schedule 1, until returned to Corbus for destruction.  In 
other countries, storage conditions must meet country and local requirements.  
The site pharmacist, investigator  or designee  will maintain  accurate logs of drug shipments 
received, returned to Corbus or destroyed to ensure the appropriate amount of study drug is 
kept on site and that it is used for research purposes only.  He/she will perform drug 
accountability procedures such as checking d rug shipments against the shipping contents 
form, maintaining a log of the amount of study drug provided to individual subjects, and 
reconciling used and unused drug supply by subjects and the study unit.  
If any lenabasum is lost or damaged, its dispositi on should be documented in the source 
documents.  Lost or damaged lenabasum should be reported to the Drug Enforcement 
Agency (DEA) in the US and as required by authorities in other countries.    
Subjects will be instructed to store study drug  at home at room temperature, away from 
temperature and humidity extremes, in areas that are not accessible to children.  All study 
drug that is not ingested by study subjects will be disposed of according to instructions 
provided to the sites or returned to Corbus, as requested by Corbus.    
Detailed instructions will be in a manual supplied to the site by Corbus.  
8.8 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
The IWRS will be used for assignment of a unique  Subject Identification number (SID), 
randomization to a treatment, and assignment of study drug  vial numbers to each subject.  A 
subject is considered randomized into the study upon receipt from the IWRS of the SID.  
Subjects will be randomized before  Visit 1 to one of Cohorts 1 to 3.  A central randomization 
scheme will be used.  Randomization does not require the subject’s presence at the site.  The 
randomization steps are the following:  
● Before  accessing the IWRS t he investigator  or designee  should confirm the subject 
meets all eligibility criteria  
● The investigator  or designee  contacts the IWRS confirms the site and subject ID and that 
subject meets eligibility criteria .  
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 66 of 122 
 ● The IWRS randomizes the subject to a treatment  cohort  (cohorts 1,  2 or 3) and generates 
a shipment request  
● The investigator  or designee  will receive a randomization confirmation notification via 
fax or email   
● Based on the randomization, the appropriate study drug  will be sent by the distributor to 
the site  
● At or just before  Visit 1  the IWRS will be accessed to assign the appropriate bottles to 
the subject . 
At the time of study start up, a supply of study drug may be shipped to some sites ahead of 
subject randomization.  In that case, the same randomization process will be followed except  
the investigator or designee  will be instructed which bottles of drug to dispense and will not 
need to wait for drug to be shipped to the site.  
8.9 Dispensing, Compliance, and Accountability  
8.9.1 Dispensing  
The study drug  will be dispensed from the site pharmacy or the investigator ’s storage cabinet 
in a blinded fashion upon request from the investigator  or designee .  The study drug  
dispensed to the subject will be based on treatment assignment for that individual.  No more 
than a 28 -day supply of st udy drug plus packaged overage in the bottle(s) may be provided to 
the subject at time of dispensing.  Detailed instructions will be in a manual provided to the 
site by Corbus.  
8.9.2 Compliance  with Treatment  
The number of capsules of study drug  returned to the site will be counted and recorded as a 
measure of subject compliance with treatment.  For subjects receiving lenabasum, lack of 
compliance with treatment will be suspected for subjects whose trough plasma concentrations 
of lenabasum are more than two stand ard deviations from the mean for other subjects 
receiving the same dose.  This assessment will occur only after the study blind has been 
broken.  
8.9.3 Accountability  
A repository of study drug  will be held at distribution depots.  Study drug  will be distributed 
to the site pharmacy or investigator  by express mail with tracking.  
Depending upon the arrangements at the individual site, either the investigator  or designee  or 
the designated site pharmacist is responsible for maintaining accountability for the receipt,  
dispensing and return of all study medication.  Procedures for tracking shipment, receipt, 
distribution and collection of unused study drug  will be in a manual provided by Corbus to 
each site.  
8.10 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
The intent is that each subject is maintained on all his/her baseline medications for CF from 
screening through Visit 9, unless the investigator or treating physician judges a change in 
therapy is needed to provide best medical care for the subject.  Infor mation about the 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 67 of 122 
 concomitant medications and treatments will be collected at each Visit.  All concomitant 
medications given to the subject during the study will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Concomitant therapies taken for the long -term treatment of pre -existin g conditions may be 
continued during the study provided they are in accordance with the exclusion criteria.  It is 
preferred that these medications be stabilized before entry and continued wherever practical 
without variation of dose or regimen during the study.  
During the study, new medications should be administered at the discretion of the 
investigator to provide the subject with the best medical care.  Because of  the unavailability 
of toxicology data and limited clinical experience with lenabasum  in co mbination with other 
therapeutic agents , it is recommended that changes in ongoing treatments or introduction of 
new therapies are kept to a minimum.  The risk/benefit to the subject should be carefully 
assessed and consideration given to the timing of any  introductions of new medications.  
The intent is that all medications used to treat CF are allowed as concomitant medications 
except corticosteroids in doses > 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent.  Among the 
permitted concomitant medications for CF dur ing the study are the following:  
● Mucolytics including dornase alfa   
● Hypertonic saline  
● Inhaled and oral prophylactic antibiotics  
● Bronchodilators  
● Anticholinergics  
● Membrane stabilizers  
● Anti-inflammatory agents such as azithromycin and ibuprofen  
● CFTR -target ing drugs  
● Corticosteroids ≤ 10 mg QD oral prednisone or equivalent  
● Multivitamins  
● Nutritional supplements  
● Digestive enzymes  
● Stool softeners  and other medications for constipation   
● Proton pump inhibitors and other medications for gastrointestinal reflux  
● Antihistamines  
● Corticosteroid nasal sprays . 
A list of disallowed medications is provided in  Table 7.

 Table 7 Disallowed Medications  
Drug Class  Requirements  
Corticosteroids > 10 mg per day oral 
prednisone or equivalent  Prohibited for 14 days  before Visit 1  
Investigational agents  Prohibited for 30 day s or 5 therapeutic 
half-lives before Visit 1, whichever is 
longer, and during the study  
Any cannabinoid or cannabinoid derivative, 
including recreational marijuana, medicinal 
marijuana, or other prescription cannabinoids  Prohibited from screening to the end of 
the study  
Corticosteroids > 10 mg per day oral prednisone or equivalent may be needed to treat PEx in 
some subjects during the study and are allowed for that purpose.   It is anticipated that such 
use would be temporary and rela ted to a PEx , except in a rare case where higher dose of 
corticosteroid use is for longer duration (e.g. for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis). In 
all such cases corticosteroid use, and continued use of investigational drug should be 
assessed by inv estigator, and preferably be discussed with medical monitor.  
9 EFFICACY , SAFETY , PHARMACOKINETICS ASSESSMENTS  
9.1 Efficacy Variables  
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Variable : PEx 
The primary efficacy variable will be based on the  occurrence of new PEx.   The occurrence 
of a new PEx will be assessed  throughout the active dosing and safety follow -up periods.   
At screening and again at  Visit  1, subjects and/or their legally acceptable representative will 
be instructed when and how to call the site staff  to report  new or worsening respiratory or 
systemic symptoms.  Subjects who experience new or worsening respiratory symptoms or 
have received a prescription for a new antibiotic from a physician other than a study 
physician will contact the site staff  and return for  an unscheduled Possible PEx  Visit if 
directed to do so.  
At each visit,  the investigator will assess the subject for the presence of any new or 
worsening respiratory symptoms.  The physician will assess medical history for changes from 
last visit, perform physical examination of the lungs and physical examination of other 
organs as indicated by change in medical history, and complete the  antibiotic use for 
respiratory signs and symptoms questionnaire (AUR -Q; Appendix B) . This questionnaire 
includes Fuchs cr iteria (Fuchs et al, 1994)  and also a list of additional signs and symptoms , 
that may have led a physician to make a diagnosis of pulmonary exacerbation.  The physician 
does not need to determine if there is  a 28-day gap  from last use of antibiotics to the new 
antibiotics  for efficacy analysis purposes . The 28-day gap will be determined  centrally.  
9.1.2 PEx as secondary variable  
Time to first new PEx using the primary definition of P Ex will be a secondary endpoint. In 
addition , an alternative de finition of PEx as defined in the protocol will be a secondary 
variable that will be collected.

 9.1.3 Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire – Revised Respiratory Symptom Score  
The CFQ -R is a well -established disease -specific health -related quality of life measure for 
children, adolescents and adults with CF ( Quittner et al, 2005 , Dill et al, 2013 ).  It is a profile 
measure of health -related qualify of life which consists of self -reported items and has proven 
reliability and validity.  The CFQ -R measures functioning in a variety of domains, including 
Physical Functioning, Vitality, Health Perceptions, Respiratory Symptoms, Treatment 
Burden, Role Functioning, Emotional Functioning, and Social Function ing.   
The Adolescent/Adult version of the CFQ -R will be used for subjects ≥ 14  years of age  at the 
time of consent . For subjects ages 12 -13 at the time of consent , two versions of the 
questionnaire will be administered ; the Child version for ages 12-13 will be given to the 
subject, and the Parent/Caregiver version for ages 6 -13 will be administered to one of the 
subject’s parents or legal representatives (all efforts should be made to have the same parent 
fill out this questionnaire at each require d study visit, if possible).  The subject will be 
provided the CFQ -R in their native language, if not fluent in English , and will be asked to fill 
out the questionnaire before other interactions with site staff.  
9.1.4 Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second  and F orced Vital Capacity  
Spirometry including measurement s of FEV1 and FVC will be done at screening , at Visits 1 -
9 and all Possible PEx Visits . FEV1 is the volume of air that can be blown forcibly out of the 
lungs in 1 second, after full inspiration. FVC is t he amount of air which can be forcibly 
exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Both FEV1 and FVC results 
will be calculated as % predicted and m L (absolute) . 
The same  equipment and operator should be used for each mea surement, for a given subject.  
For a given subject, the investigator must determine at Visit 1 whether measurements at all 
Visits for that subject will be done without bronchodilator pre -treatment  or with 
bronchodilator pre -treatment.  The measurements must be done at a ll Visits for a given 
subject using a consistent procedure.  It is preferred that measurements be done without pre -
bronchodilator treatment .  In this case, any t reatment with short -acting bronchodilators will 
be held for four hours before  the pre -bronchodilator spirometry, unless medically necessary.   
Some subjects with low FEV1 measurements may not tolerate spirometry without pre -
bronchodilator treatment.  For th ese subjects, it is acceptable to pre -treat with a short -acting 
bronchodilator  10-20 minutes before  spirometry.  For these subjects, pre -treatment with 
bronchodilator should be done before every spirometry procedure.  
Ideally, FEV1 values will be measured o n 3 spirograms of acceptable quality and 
reproducibility .  The largest FEV1 will be reported.  Other spirometry values will be taken 
from the spirogram with the largest FEV1  (e.g., FEF25 -75).  The calculation of absolute and 
percent predicted FEV1 and FVC will be done centrally.  It is acknowledged that for subjects 
with low FEV1 or a PEx it may not be possible to get 3 spirograms of acceptable quality, in 
which case the largest FEV1 will be reported.  
Detailed methods for spirometry will be in a manual pro vided to each site by Corbus.

 9.1.5 Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Symptom Diary (CFRSD) - Chronic Respiratory 
Infection Symptom Sc ore (CRISS)  
The 16 – item CFRSD questionnaire ( Goss et al, 2009 ) will be completed at screening for  
training purposes, at Visits 1 -9 and all Possible PEx Visits.  This is a validated disease -
specific tool . The CFRSD -CRISS is a symptom measure that is part of the CFRSD  and takes 
about 5 minutes to complete.  The CFRSD -CRISS is referred to as the CRISS throughout this 
protocol.  
9.1.6 Sputum Evaluation  
Sputum specimens should be obtained from  each subject at Visit  1, Visit 2, Visit 5 and Visit 
8 and any Possible PEx Visit . Assessments o f sputum include  cell counts, s oluble biomarkers  
of inflammation , and quantitative of bacteria.  Analyses of cell counts and soluble biomarkers  
include at least numbers and percentages of total cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, 
monocytes/macrophages, basophils, neutrophil el astase, myeloperoxidase, interleukin -8, and 
immunoglobulin G levels. Other biomarkers of inflammation may be analyzed and reported 
separately.  
To reduce variability in results , it is important that the same method – spontaneous or 
induced – is used  to obtain s putum from a given subject throughout the study.    
At screening and Visit 1, subjects will be instructed how to provide a spontaneous sputum 
sample.   If the subject thinks they will not be able to produce a sputum sample spontaneously 
at each visit  when required , the subject will be asked to produce sputum sample via induction  
instead .  Adolescents should try to produce sputum spontaneously and can opt out of sputum 
induction.  The choice of method – spontaneous or induced - will be made at Visit 1 after 
instruction s on how to produce a spontaneous sample and discussion between site staff  and 
the subject and before collection of sputum.  
Sputum will be collected in a sterile specimen cup.  Spontaneously produced sputum can be 
collected anytime during the visit.  Sputum collection by induction should occur after 
spirometry.  Sputum induction should be performed in accordance with standard operating 
procedure  at the site . 
9.1.7 Blood Biomarkers of Inflammation  
High sensitivity c-reactive protein ( CRP ) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR) measure 
systemic inflammation and will be assessed at  visits specified in the schedule of assessments . 
Other biomarkers of inflammation may be analyzed and reported separately.  
9.1.8 Body Mass Index  
Lower BMI is associat ed with worse pulmonary function  in CF.  Body mass index will be 
calculated centrally at each visit for all subjects  from weight and height .  Weight will be 
measured with coats, jacket, and footwear removed.  Height will be measured with footwear 
removed.  The BMI Z scores also will be calculated centrally for subjects ≤ 20 years of age.

 9.2 Safety Variables  
9.2.1 Adverse Events  
The primary safety outcome of lenabasum is the occurrence of TEAEs.  A TEAE is defined 
as an AE that is not present before the initiation of the treatments or any event already 
present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the treatments.  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered dr ug related.  Another definition of AE is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and which 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.   
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Intercurrent illnesses or 
injuries will be regarded as AEs. Any event of abuse, misuse or addiction should be reported 
as an adverse event. Drug abuse is defined as the intentional, non -therapeutic use of a drug 
product or substance, even once, to achieve a desired psy chological or physiological effect. 
Drug misuse is defined as the use of a substance for a purpose not consistent with legal or 
medical guidelines . According to American Psychiatric Association , addiction  is a complex 
condition, a brain disease that is manifested by compulsive substance use despite harmful 
consequence.  
When collecting AEs, record the diagnosis when possible,  as opposed to recording a list of 
signs and symptoms  only. If a diagnosis is known  and there are other signs or symptoms that 
are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.  
This definition also includes accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug 
administ ration and/or dose) other than planned titration, reasons for admission to a hospital 
or reasons for surgical procedures (unless for minor elective surgery for a pre -existing 
condition).  It also includes AEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based on the 
pharmacological effect of the study medication.     
Abnormal results of any laboratory test or diagnostic procedure will be considered AEs if the 
event has any of the following characteristics:  
● Results in study withdrawal . 
● Is associated with a SAE . 
● Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms . 
● Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  (beyond single repeat ). 
● Is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance.   
Wherever possible the Investigator should report the clinic al, rath er than the laboratory term 
(e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  
The Investigator will assess all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical significance.  If 
any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator must 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 72 of 122 
 provide details about the action taken with respect to the study drug  and about the subject’s 
outcome.   
Adverse events will be captured from the time  the subject signs the informed consent to the 
end of the subject’s participation in the study.  Adverse events should be recorded as 
diagnoses, if available.  If not, separate s ign(s) and symptom(s) are recorded.  One 
diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.  
Death is not considered an AE, but the cause of death is.  An exception is the event of sudden 
death of unknown cause.  Similarly, hospitalizations and procedures are  not AEs; however, 
the reasons for hospi talization and procedures are.  A report of death or hospitalization 
without a cause provided will be recorded initially as a n SAE until the underlying cause  is 
identified.  However, if deemed necessary by the invest igator, a procedure can be captured as 
an AE, along with the reason for conducting the procedure.  An overdose or medication error 
is not an AE unless it is temporally associated with an unfavorable or unintended sign or 
symptom.   
The investigator or designee  will report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously 
reported by the trial subject using concise medical terminology.  In addition, each trial 
subject will be questioned about AEs.  
All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by the i nvestigator or reported by the 
subject, must be recorded, with details about the duration and intensity of each episode, the 
action taken with respect to the study drug , and the subject’s outcome.  
9.2.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events are a subset of AEs.  A serious adverse events (SAE) is defined as any 
adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria:  
● Results in death . 
● Is life -threatening . 
The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
● Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
● Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
● Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of a subject . 
● Is an important medical event . 
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate 
in situations where none  of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events 
that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed 
in the definition above should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitaliza tion, or the 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 73 of 122 
 development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during treatment 
should be considered as medically important.  
An AE caused by an overdose or medication error is considered serious if  the event results in 
one of the ou tcomes listed above.   Serious AEs also include any other event that the 
investigator or the Medical Monitor judges to be serious or which is defined as serious by 
regulatory authorities.  
9.2.3 Disease worsening  
Any medically significant worsening in cystic fibr osis, as judged by the investigator, will be 
recorded as an AE.  Examples of such events include but are not limited to pulmonary 
exacerbation.  
9.2.4 Adverse events of special interest  
Adverse events  of special interest (AESI) will also be recorded in detail and  narratives will 
be generated for those. Adverse events  of special interest  are noted in Table 8. 
Table 8 Adverse events of special interest and information to be collected  
Adverse event of special interest  Additional information to be collected  
Dizziness/light -headedness  • If intermittent or a single event, 
average duration of episode in 
minutes  
• Temporal relationship to dose (when 
was the last dose of study drug prior 
to start of AE)  
• Was it associated with vertigo  
• Was it positional (orthostatic)  
• Any other associated symptoms (if 
yes please report them separately in 
AE) 
9.2.5 Procedures for Assessing, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events and 
Serious Adverse Events  
Throughout the duration of the study, the investigator or designees will closely monitor each 
subject.  All AEs which occur during the study, whether observed by the investigator or by 
the subject, and whether or not thought to be related to study drug will be recorded.  The 
description of the AEs as recorded on the eCRF will include a description of event, start date, 
stopping date, intensity, if it was serious, relationship to study drug, what actions were taken 
with respect to the study drug, if treatment was required and the subject’s outcome.  
The investigator must evaluate each AE for its relation ship to the study drug and for its 
seriousness.  All AEs related to study drug must be followed until resolution or until they

 9.2.5.1  Time and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
Safety events will be assessed from the time of signing of i nformed consent through the last 
visit which can include a withdrawal visit.  
At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AEs since the last 
visit.  Adverse events related to study drug  will be followed for outcome information until 
resolution or stabilization.  
Reporting guidelines will be followed.  
9.2.5.2  Characteristics of Adverse Events  
Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event  
Severity is used to describe the intensity of a spe cific AE.  The following standard with 3 
grades will be used to measure the severity of AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory 
values and SAEs:  
• Mild:  No disruption of normal daily activities  
• Moderate:  Affect normal daily activities  
• Severe:  Inability to perform daily activities.   
Relationship to Study Intervention  
After naming and grading the AE, the investigator must assign an attribution to the AE using 
the following categories:

 Table 9 Adverse Event Causal ity Grading  
Relationship  Attribution  Description  
Unrelated to study product  Unrelated  The AE is clearly not related  to the study 
product  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related  to the study 
product. Disease or other concomitant 
medications provide more plausible explanations 
for the AE.  Time to drug intake makes a 
relationship with AE improbable  
Related to study product  Possible  The AE may be related  to the study product. 
AE could also be explained by disease or other 
drugs.  Reasonable time relationship to drug 
intake  
Probable  The AE is likely related  to the study product.  
AE is unlikely to be attributed to disease or other 
drugs.  AE has a plausible time relationship to 
drug intake  
Definite  The AE is clearly related  to the study product. 
AE cannot be explained by disease or other 
drugs. AE has a plausible time relationship to 
drug intake  
Adverse events listed as ‘possibly, probably, or definitely’ related to the study product are 
considered to have a suspected ‘reasonable causal relationship’ to the study product.  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study product cause d the AE.  "Reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study product and the AEs.  Suspected adverse reaction 
implies less certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by 
the study product.  
9.2.5.3  Reporting Procedures  
The reporting of the study will comply with all relevant regulatory authorities and site -
specific EC requirements.  
Controlled Substance Reporting  
As required, the site pharmacist or investigator or designee will complete and keep a copy of 
controlled substance forms.  
Unanticipated Problem Reporting to Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee  
An unanticipated problem is one that is unexpected, related to participation in research and 
suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm.  Incidents or 
events that meet the criteria for unanticipated problems that need to b e reported to the EC as 
per the relevant reviewing regulatory authority require the completion of an unanticipated 
problem eCRF by the investigator or designee within 24 hours of learning of the event, which 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 76 of 122 
 will prompt an immediate notification to the Med ical Monitor.  Through this mechanism, the 
Medical Monitor will receive an alert that the report has been or is being filed with the 
reviewing EC.  The investigator will follow his/her reviewing EC procedures when reporting 
an AE or any other incident, exp erience, or outcome as an unanticipated problem to the EC. 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported 
using the following timeline or per the reviewing EC requirements, whichever is shorter:   
● SAEs will be repo rted to the EC within 7 days of the investigator becoming aware of the 
event and to regulatory authorities per their published timeframes.  
● Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the EC within 14 days of the 
investigator becoming aware of the p roblem.  
● All unanticipated problems should be reported to other appropriate institutional officials 
as required by that institution’s written reporting procedures.  
SAE Reporting  
All SAEs must be reported immediately to the Sponsor (or their designated representative) no 
more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event . 
Any AE that meets the specified SAE criteria will be recorded on an SAE CRF, by the 
investigator or qualified designee.  The investigator must complete and save  the SAE eCR F 
immediately, which will prompt an electronic notification to the Sponsor (or their designated 
representative).  Follow -up information on the SAE will be provided in a timely manner to 
the Medical Monitor and recorded on eCRF form(s).   
Reporting of SAEs and AEs to Country Regulatory Agencies  
The mandatory reporting of safety events to regulatory authorities will be followed as 
required by applicable regulatory authority , and as per the applicable reporting timelines .   
9.2.6 Other  Safety Variables  
9.2.6.1  Tolerability  
Tolerability is defined as discontinuation of study drug  as the result of TEAE(s) that are 
probably or definitely -related  to study drug .  Subjects who discontinue study drug  due to 
SAE/AE must be clearly distinguished from subjects who discontinue for othe r reasons.  
Investigators will follow subjects who discontinue/withdraw from study as result of SAE/A E 
until resolution of the event.  
9.2.6.2  Medical History and Use of Contraception  
Medical history includes subject demographics, documentation of history of CF and  current 
treatment for CF.  The medical history will also include concurrent illnesses, other current 
medications, past relevant medical history, child -bearing potential, last menstrual period 
(LMP) for women, and review of systems.  Date of LMP and method  of contraception will be 
assessed at screening and all visits in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP).  
9.2.6.3  Concomitant Medications  
A list of current prescription and over -the-counter medications and supplements will be 
obtained.  Concomitant medications will be recorded on the concomitant medication eCRF at 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002

 screening and all visits.  The medication, dose, frequency, route, start date,  stop date and 
indication will be captured.  
9.2.6.4  Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations will be performed at screening , Visit s 1-9, and Possible PEx Visits  by 
a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician’s assistant in accordance with the local law who 
will determine findings and assess any abnormalities as to clinical significance.   
A full p hysical examination  will include the following assessment: alertness and 
orientation, general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, lungs, heart, 
abdo men, musculoskeletal examination, and lymph nodes.  Breast and genitourinary 
examinations are not required.  
A brief physical examination  will include general appearance, lungs, heart, abdomen, and 
any other organ system as indicated by change in medical hi story from last visit.  
Visit 1 medical examination will be used as baseline.  Medically significant changes that 
reflect worsening from baseline will be considered AEs and recorded as such.  
9.2.6.5  Vital Signs  
For purposes of this study v ital signs include BP, P, R, T, weight , height,  and O 2 saturation 
measurements.  Vital signs will be measured  at each visit.   
Systolic and diastolic BP should  be measured with the subject supine for at least 5 minutes 
and will be recorded twice at least 1 minute apart.  The same arm should be used for the 
measurement throughout the study.  The average value of both measurements should  be used.  
O2 saturation, P and  R will also be measured with the subject supine for at least 5 minutes.  
Body temperature will be measured on the skin or in the mouth.  Weight will be measured 
with coats, jacket, and footwear removed.  Standing height will be measured with footwear 
remove d. 
9.2.6.6  Laboratory Safety Tests  
Blood and urine laboratory safety tests will be performed at each visit.  The results of all tests 
will be reviewed by the investigator or designee, who will make judgments on the medical 
significance of any new or worsening abno rmal value.  New medically significant abnormal 
laboratory results that are related to safety of study drug  should be repeated as soon as 
possible to confirm the abnormality.  
The results of clinical laboratory tests at the time of last measurement prior to  study drug  
administration on Visit 1 will provide baseline references against which any fluctuations in 
these indices can be compared.  
All blood laboratory tests will be performed in a licensed, central clinical laboratory, to 
provide appropriate longitud inal and cross -site comparisons.  The following blood tests will 
be performed by a central laboratory:  
● Serum βhCG in women of childbearing potential . 
● Follicle stimulating hormone for women > 45 and ≤ 55 years of age with no menses for 
< 2 years . 
● Hepatitis B and C tests .

 ● Human immunodeficiency virus tests . 
● Complete blood count with differential cell count and platelets . 
● Metabolic panel comprising glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, total protein, albumin,  total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferas e, and alanine aminotransferase . 
● High sensitivity CRP , ESR and other inflammatory biomarkers . 
Urine laboratory tests will be performed on site:  
● Urine pregnancy tests on women of childbearing potential . 
● Urine dipstick for blood, albumin/protein, and glucose.  
9.2.6.7  Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at Visit 1 before administration of the first dose of study 
drug, 3.0 ± 0.5 hours after first dose of study dru g and at Visit 5 and Visit 8 .  
Twelve -lead ECGs are to be recorded with the subject in a rested supine for at least 10 
minutes before  the test, using centrally supplied ECG machines.  The ECGs will be read 
centrally.  After central reading, the  medical significance of any new ECG abnormality will 
be assessed by the investigator.  
9.2.6.8  Pregnancies  
The effect of lenabasum in pregnancy is unknown.  Women subjects of childbearing potential 
will be instructed to inform the  investigator if they become pregnant during the study and 
within 28 days after taking the final dose of study product.  If the pregnancy occurs during 
the treatment period, the investigator should immediately discontinue the study product and 
instruct the  subject to return any unused portion of study product to the study staff.  
Pregnancies occurring while the subject is on lenabasum or within 28 days after the subject’s 
last dose of lenabasum should be reported by the site to the Sponsor within 24 hours o f the 
site being made aware.  The investigator will counsel the subject about the risks of the 
pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  
To report pregnancies in subjects, the investigator must complete a Pregnancy Reporting 
Form within 24 hours aft er learning of the pregnancy, which will prompt an electronic 
notification to the Sponsor (or their designated representative).  The pregnancy must be 
reported to the EC within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy.  The 
subject should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive 
toxicity for further evaluation and counselling.  The investigator or qualified designee will 
follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and 30 days after the birth, and repo rt 
follow -up findings to the EC.  
Please note that pregnancy in the female partner of a male study subject is also a reportable 
event, and the same timelines and reporting procedures should be followed.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria fo r immediate classification as a SAE (i.e., 
spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator should

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 79 of 122 
 follow the procedures for expedited repor ting of SAEs. All neonatal deaths that occur within 
30 days of birth should be reported as SAEs without regard to causality.  
9.3 Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Plasma samples  will be collected on Visit 1 before and at 3 ± 0.5 hours after administration 
of the first dose of study drug and at Visit  2, Visit  5 and Visit 8  pre-dose to assess trough 
concentration levels .  Lenabasum plasma concentrations will be measured  using a 
quantitative LC -MS/MS method and lenabasum metabol ites will be detected using a 
qualitative LC -MS/MS method.  
To obtain trough concentrations of lenabasum o n Visit 2, Visit 5 and Visit 8, the blood 
sample for lenabasum plasma concentration should be obtained between 8 and 16 hours after 
the last dose of s tudy drug.  The site staff  should instruct the subject to hold the dose of study 
drug on the morning of those visit s or take the dose earlier on that morning if necessary  to 
ensure that the blood sample will be drawn within this 8 - to 16 -hour window.  For example, 
if the subject takes the evening dose of study drug at  10 PM and blood will be drawn between 
6 AM and 2 PM  or 8-16 hours later , then the subject would be instructed to hold the morning 
dose until the blood sample is obtained .  If that same subject will have blood drawn after 2 
PM, then that subject should be instructed to take the morning dose at least 8 hours prior to 
the anticipated time of blood drawing, for example 8 AM for blood to be drawn at 4 PM  for 
an 8-hour interval.  This instruction whether to take or hold the dose on the morning of Visit 
2, Visit 5 and Visit 8 require s that the site staff  knows  when the subject takes their study drug  
and the likely time of blood drawing at the visit .  
The time of last dose of study dr ug will be recorded.  If the subject held the morning  dose of 
study drug, the subject may take that dose of study drug as convenient after blood for plasma 
concentration and metabolites of lenabasum is drawn .

Some subjects may receive antibiotic therapy for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms or 
systemic symptoms from a physician other than the study investigator .  In this case, site staff  
will ask the subject to return for a Possible PEx Visit  as soon as feasi ble. Though it is 
expected that this visit will be in person at the study sites, there may be occasions that this 
visit is completed over the telephone by the investigator. The investigator will assess the 
subject and complete the AUR -Q. 
10.2.8  Follow -up Visits f or Subject s Who Prematurely Discontinue  Study Drug  
Subjects who discontinue  the study drug and do not withdraw consent will be asked to return 
for Visit 5 and Visit 8, as applicable, for safety follow -up so clinical data can be obtained on 
these subjects  at these scheduled times . Subjects also may be asked to participate in a 
separate observational two-year safety follow -up study.  No new study drug will be dispensed 
at these visits.  
10.2.9  Visit 9  or Safety Follow -Up Visit for Subjects Who Prematurely Discontinue  
Study Drug  
Visit 9 is a safety visit held 28 ± 7 days after discontinuation of study drug for subjects who 
complete Visit 8 in the study.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue  study drug,  do not 
withdraw consent , and do not  agree to return for Visit 5 or Visit 8, as applicable, will have a 
Safety Follow -up Visit 28 ± 7 days after the last dose of study drug  that includes  the same  
assessments performed at Visit 9.

11 STATISTICAL METHODS PLANNED AND SAMPLE SIZE  
11.1 Sample Size  
The study is expec ted to enroll approximately 415 subjects, with ~ 166 subjects each in the 
lenabasum 20 mg BID and placebo BID cohorts and ~ 83 subjects in the lenabasum 5 mg BID 
cohort (accounting for an approximate 15% dropout rate).  The study provides 80% power to 
detect  a significant difference between the lenabasum 20 mg BID dose and placebo in the 
primary endpoint (PEx event rate) at a two -sided alpha of 0.05.   This is based on an event 
rate ratio of 0.65 (a 35% event rate reduction in the lenabasum group) , when the the event 
rate in the control group is 0.80 (modified assumptions from Sponsor briefing document for 
Orkambi, 2015 ).   
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 91 of 122 This also provides 90% power to detect a significant difference between  lenabasum 20 mg 
BID and placebo BID in the secondary endpoint, time to first PEx.  This is based on an 
estimate of the probability of an event (PEx) in the placebo group of 0.60, an estimated 
hazard ratio of 0.60 (risk reduction 0.40), and the probability  of an event in the lenabasum 
group of 0.36  
11.2 Analysis Populations  
There will be four analysis populations.  The modified intent to treat (mITT ) population will 
consist of all randomized subjects who received study drug.  These will be categorized by 
planned treatment.  This population will be used for the primary analysis. The safety set (SS) 
will consist of all subjects who received study drug.   This population will be categorized by 
actual treatment.   
The per protocol set (PPS) will consist of the mITT population minus subjects with major 
protocol deviations.  Major protocol violations are defined as those that may have a 
substantial effect on  the efficacy assessment and will be determined before database lock.  
The PPS will be used in sensitivity analyses.  
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS) will consist of all subjects from the S S whose 
pharmacokinetic data are adequate for the calculatio n of primary PK parameters.  Inclusion 
in the PKAS of subjects with missing data or protocol violations or inadequate dosing will be 
considered on a case -by-case basis.  The PKAS will be the analysis set used for all 
pharmacokinetic analyses.  
11.3 Data Presenta tion 
All data will be provided in data listings sorted by treatment groups, subject number and 
visit.  Summary data will be presented in tabular format by treatment group.  Categorical data 
will be summarized by the number and percentage of subjects in eac h category.  Continuous 
data will be summarized by descriptive statistics including n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, and range.  All percentages will be rounded to 1 decimal place.  Differences between 
treatment groups will be calculated as active – placebo.  The baseline measure will be 
defined as the last non -missing measure before initiation of study drug at Visit 1.  
11.4 Efficacy Analyses  
The overall type I error rate will be controlled for primary and secondary efficacy outcomes 
with a fixed sequence in dependent hierarchical assessment of efficacy. The order of the 
secondary endpoint tests for treatment effect will be pre -specified in the statistical analysis 
plan.  Statistical significance within an endpoint (including the primary endpoint) must be 
achieved to continue in the assessment of the next endpoint.  
Efficacy comparisons will be made between each dose of lenabasum and placebo.  The event 
rate of new PEx will be compared between the lenabasum and placebo groups using a 
Poisson regression model.  A  sensitivity analysis will be performed using a negative binomial 
regression model.  
For time to first PEx, a Cox -proportional hazards (regression) model will be used for 
comparing the covariate -adjusted difference in event time distributions between the ac tive 
and placebo groups.  Covariates in the model will include all stratification variables. A log 
rank test will also be performed as a sensitivity analysis.

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 92 of 122 Continuous variable endpoints such as change in CRISS, change in CFQ -R domain scores, 
change in F EV1 % predicted, change in FEV1 ml, change in FVC % predicted, change in 
FVC ml and change in BMI will be analyzed using an MMRM (mixed model repeated 
measures). The MMRM model will include stratification factors, visit, treatment, and 
treatment -by-visit i nteraction as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate.  
The treatment comparisons for the proportion of subjects who improve by predefined criteria 
(for CRISS, CFQ -R, and FEV1 % predicted) will be performed using a Co chran -Mantel -
Haenszel test.  
Assessment of recovery from  PEx will be analyzed for the proportion of subjects who are 
rapid responders and the proportion of subjects with FEV1 improvement using Fisher’s exact 
tests.  
Data from subjects who discontinue study drug but do not discontinue t he study and return 
for off -treatment Visit 5 and Visit 8, as applicable, will be included as data for that cohort.   
Thus, both on -treatment assessment of PEx and assessments of PEx after treatment 
discontinuation (for subjects who discontinued dosing earl y) will be included in primary 
analyses.  
11.5 Safety Analyses  
No formal statistical testing will be performed to compare the safety in different cohorts.  
The number and percentage of subjects with AEs will be summarized for each treatment by 
system organ class and preferred term .  Similar summaries will be presented for AEs related 
to study drug, AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug, SAEs, and AEs 
resulting in death.  Any AE with a relationship category of possible or probable is considered 
related to study drug.  The AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  All reported AEs will be provided in separate data listings.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize clinical laboratory parameters, vita l signs and 
their corresponding change from baseline for each treatment by scheduled timepoint.  
The number and percentages of subjects with normal, abnormal and clinically significant), 
and abnormal and not clinically significant ECG findings during treat ment will be 
summarized for each treatment by scheduled timepoint.

12.1 Data Monitoring Committee  
Oversight of subject safety in this trial will be provided by a DMC subcommittee of the 
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Data Safety Monitoring Board  and will be an 
independent group of CF experts that will advise Corbus.  The members of the DMC will 
serve in an individual capacity and provide their expertise and recommendations.  The 
members of the DMC will be recommended to Corbus by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
Therapeutics Data Safety Monitoring Board O perations Center at the University of Arizona 
and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Clinical Trials Network and will include members 
from both the United States and Europe.  Besides CF experts, a member who is experienced 
in the monitoring of central ne rvous system  AEs will be included in the DMC.  
The primary responsibilities of the DMC will be to: 1) periodically review and evaluate the 
accumulated study data for participant safety, study conduct and progress, and, when 
appropriate, efficacy; and 2) mak e recommendations to Corbus concerning the continuation, 
modification, or termination of the trial.   
The DMC will be responsible for defining its deliberative processes, including event triggers 
that would call for an unscheduled review, stopping guidelin es, unblinding and voting 
procedures before  initiating any data review.  The DMC is responsible for maintaining the 
confidentiality of its internal discussions and activities as well as the contents of reports 
provided to it.  
During the trial, the DMC wil l review cumulative study data to evaluate safety, study 
conduct, and scientific validity and integrity of the trial and will review efficacy data for a 
futility analysis.  The DMC is expected to review all reported AEs in an unblinded manner. 
The DMC is a lso expected to review confirmatory pharmacokinetic  (PK)  data from a subset 
of approximately 20  adolescents to estimate the exposure in comparison to about 20 adult s. 
This should yield approximately  8 adolescents receiving lenabasum 20 mg BID  and 4 
adolescents receiving lenabasum 5 mg BID  (8 adolescents receiving placebo ).  The DMC 
will have unblinded access to the available PK data and all safety data during this review  
which will include , at the minimum , Visit 1 post -dose PK data from the subjects under 
review .  The Sponsor , investigative sites  and regulatory agencies will remain blinded to the 
treatment assignments  for these DMC reviews and analyses .  If indicated by the data, the 
DMC may recommend changes to dosing in adolescents.  
The individual D MC members must be satisfied that the timeliness, completeness, and 
accuracy of the data submitted to them for review are sufficient for evaluation of the safety 
and welfare of study participants and futility analysis.  Items reviewed by the DMC will be 
outlined in the DMC Charter and may include:

data  
• Factors external to the study such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may 
affect participant safety or the ethics of the study  
• Interim data for futility analyses.  
If there are any unanticipated s afety problems during the course of the study, the sponsor’s 
designee will submit available information related to the unanticipated problem to the DMC 
chair for review.  The DMC chair will determine if the unanticipated problem warrants 
calling an unsched uled full DMC meeting or not.  In the case that an unanticipated problem 
requires a full DMC meeting, the DMC will make a recommendation to the Sponsor 
regarding suggested corrective actions.  
The DMC should conclude each review with their recommendations t o Corbus as to whether 
the study should continue without change, be modified, or terminated.  
12.2 Medical Monitoring  
Medical Monitors have the responsibility to review and evaluate information relevant to the 
product safety throughout the development and implem entation of the protocol.  This data 
and safety review facilitates early detection of safety signals and maximizes the chances for 
continued appropriateness of the research and protection of human subjects.  This oversight 
includes providing applicable rec ommendations about subject safety.  The Medical Monitors 
will provide recommendations about subject safety to the Chief Medical Officer of Corbus, 
who, as appropriate, will report concerns about subject safety to Corbus management.  
12.3 Medical Care and Day-to-Day Safety of Subjects at the Site  
The investigator is responsible for all clinical trial -related medical decisions at his/her site 
and will oversee the day -to-day safety of subjects at his/her site.  In conjunction with site 
staff, the investigator  will review all AEs, laboratory results, safety data regarding the 
subjects’ clinical course and side effect profiles for subjects at that site.  The investigator  will 
regularly assess the number and type of AEs at that site.   
Any qualified healthcare pr ovider may provide medical care when necessary.  The 
investigator will advise subjects if medical care beyond the scope of the study is needed.  
Additionally, it is recommended that a subject’s primary care physician be notified of a 
subject’s participatio n in this research study.

  Page 95 of 122 13 DATA QUALITY  
13.1 Source Data and Record Keeping  
All investigators will keep accurate and well -organized records to ensure that the conduct of 
the study is fully documented.  The investigators or their designee  will ensure that the source 
documents and participant study files are legible and complete for  each participant.  The 
investigators will be responsible for the regular review of the conduct of the study, for 
verifying adherence to the protocol and for confirming completeness, consistency and 
accuracy of all documented data and accuracy of source do cumentation verification at his/her 
site. 
13.1.1  Data Handling, De -identification and Source Records  
The investigators and designee s will maintain appropriate records for this study, in 
compliance with ICH E6, Section 4.9 and regulatory and institutional requirem ents for the 
protection of confidentiality of subjects.  All study records will be maintained in accordance 
with Corbus’ policies and applicable regulatory requirements.  There may be circumstances 
for which Corbus is required to maintain study records and , therefore, Corbus should be 
contacted before removing study records for any reason.  
Source data/records contain all the information, which is necessary for the reconstruction and 
evaluation of the study.  The primary source document for this study will b e the subject’s 
medical record on site stored in paper form or in an electronic medical record .  If separate 
research records are maintained by the investigator, both the medical records and the research 
records will be considered the source documents for the purposes of auditing the study.   Data 
recorded on source documents will be transcribed by site staff  onto eCRFs provided by 
Corbus or its designee.   
In addition, i n this study at the time of the office visit, study -specific original data elements  
such as responses to questionnaires  will be entered directly into a web -based system without 
first being transcribed on other media such as paper.  There will be no separate source 
document for data entered directly into the web -based system.  
Source data/reco rds are: 1) original records; 2) certified copies of original records; 3) 
observations; 4) laboratory reports; and 5) eCRFs and/or data sheets.  Source data/records are 
to be kept by investigator until the end of the regulatory retention period.  All clini cal 
findings, observations, laboratory results, subject correspondence, SAE reports, and other 
information related to subject participation in the study must be maintained in subject binders 
that contain source documents and other data collection instrumen ts designed specifically for 
this investigation.   Completed eCRF pages will be reviewed by Corbus or Corbus authorized 
personnel.  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), EC review(s) and regulatory 
inspection(s), with direct access  to all the required source documents.  Site staff  will permit 
authorized representatives of Corbus, EC and government regulatory agencies to examine 
(and when required by applicable law, to copy) study records for the purposes of quality 
assurance reviews , audits, and evaluation of the study safety, progress and data validity.

CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 96 of 122 13.1.2  Privacy and Confidentiality of Subject Information  
Privacy and confidentiality of a subject will be respected throughout the study.  Consented 
subjects who meet eligibility for the s tudy will receive a unique SID.  These SID s rather than 
names will be used during collection, storage and reporting of subject information.  This 
number will be linked only through a secure SID log that connects each subject to his/her 
data.   
Information about subjects will be kept confidential an d managed per the requirements of the 
relevant regulatory authority.  These regulations require a signed subject authorization 
informing the subject of the all the following:  
● What protected health information will be collected from subjects in this study  
● Who will have access to that information and why  
● Who will use or disclose that information  
● The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their protected 
health information.  
If a subject revokes authorization to collect or use pr otected health information, Corbus by 
regulation will retain the ability to use all information collected before  the revocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use protected 
health information, attempts  will be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status 
that the subject is alive at the end of their scheduled study period.  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s statement of inf ormed consent, the investigator is obligated to obtain such 
permission in writing from the appropriate individuals.  
13.1.3  Data Management Responsibilities at the Study Site  
Data collection and accurate documentation are the responsibility of the investigator and  site 
staff under the supervision of the investigator.  All source documents and laboratory reports 
must be reviewed by the study team and data entry staff, who will ensure that they are 
accurate and complete.  A Clinical Research Associate for Corbus will  ensure the data are 
collected and maintained correctly and in compliance with GCP.  
13.1.4  Data Capture Method  
Electronic data capture on eCRFs will be used, using internet access with password 
protection and data quality checks.  It is expected that the eCRFs wi ll be submitted 
coincident with the subject visit or within 1 business day.  
13.1.5  Types of Data  
Data will be collected on subject demographics, medical history including medication, 
physical examination, AEs, vital signs, laboratory safety tests, ECGs, efficacy outcomes, and 
lenabasum plasma concentrations and metabolites.  
13.1.6  Protocol Deviations and Reporting  
The investigator should not implement any deviation from or changes of the protocol without 
agreement by Corbus and prior review and documented approval from t he reviewing EC, 
except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects or when the change

  Page 97 of 122 involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (e.g., change in monitor[s], 
change of telephone number[s]). A change of the proto col that is deemed substantial will be 
submitted to the regulatory authority and an independent Ethic Committee by the sponsor for 
notification and approval . 
The investigators and site staff are responsible to follow the written protocol as provided by 
Corbus and approved by their EC.  The investigator or designee  shall prepare and submit 
complete, accurate, and timely reports of all protocol deviations.  
A protocol deviation is an excurs ion from the protocol that is not implemented or intended as 
a systematic change and that has not received prior approval by the reviewing EC.  There are 
several types of protocol deviations with different requirements for reporting each type of 
deviation.  
An emergency protocol deviation occurs in an emergency when an excursion from the 
protocol is required to protect the life or physical well -being of a participant.  The Medical 
Monitor and the reviewing EC must be notified as soon as possible, but not later than 5 days 
after the emergency occurred.  The Medical Monitor will be notified through the EDC 
system.  
A major protocol deviation occurs in a non -emergency when the subject, investigator or 
Corbus fails to adhere to significant protocol requirements  affecting the inclusion, exclusion, 
subject safety or primary endpoint criteria.  Major protocol violations for this study include 
but are not limited to any of the following:  
● Failure to comply with GCP guidelines . 
● Failure to meet eligibility criteria at randomization  or Visit 1 . 
● Use of a prohibited concomitant medication . 
● Failure to query the subject about potential adverse events at each visit . 
● Failure to obtain AUR -Q. 
Major protocol deviations must be reported to Corbus within 5 days of first time the 
investigator or site staff  becomes aware of the deviation and must be reported to the EC 
within that EC’s guidelines. Corbus will determine if an emergency or major protocol 
deviation  should result in early discontinuation of study treatment for a subject.  An 
investigator’s failure to report promptly any known major protocol deviation is itself an 
incident of non -compliance.  
A copy of the Protocol Deviation Form will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder and in 
Corbus’ files.  The site will report the vi olation to their EC in accordance with their EC 
reporting requirements.  
A minor or administrative protocol deviation is an excursion from the protocol that does not 
affect the scientific soundness of the research plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of h uman 
subjects.  Examples of minor or administrative deviations could include: follow -up visits that 
occurred outside the protocol required time frame because of the participant’s schedule or 
blood samples obtained at times close to but not precisely at the  time points specified in the 
protocol.  If a protocol deviation occurs which meets this definition, the deviation should be 
reported to the reviewing EC (if reporting is required) at the time stipulated such as when the

  Page 98 of 122 continuing review application is su bmitted.  These minor or administrative deviations will be 
reported in the Clinical Trial Management System  within 28 days after their occurrence  or 
identification . 
13.1.7  Schedule and Content of Report  
Reports will be generated for Corbus to monitor enrollment and study conduct.  Blinded 
safety monitoring reports will be generated for the Medical Monitors and the Medical Officer 
of Corbus and un -blinded safety reports will be generated for the DMC . 
The f inal study report will be generated separately and only after the database is locked.  The 
final study report that will be generated will be stipulated in the final SAP  and any 
amendments to that SAP . 
13.2 Original Records  
This study will use direct data entry of clinical trial data into an EDC system.  Clinical trial 
data will be entered by the investigator or designee  or in cases of certain questionnaires by 
the subject or parent/guardian of minor subjects into a validated 21 CFR Part 11 compliant 
internet -based EDC system.  Changes to the clinical trial data can only be performed by the 
investigator or designee  through the change management methodology that is subject to a full 
audit trail.  
The investigators and designee s will be trained on the EDC system before enrollment of the 
first subject at their site.  A list of the status of each user, including an audit trail of status 
changes, will be maintained.  
At the end of the study, the completed online eCRF must be reviewed and signed 
electronically by the inv estigator or a designated co -investigator authorized to sign.  A 
certification must be obtained from all authorized persons to sign electronically indicating 
that their electronic signature is equivalent to their hand -written signature.  
13.3 Quality Control and  Quality Assurance  
13.3.1  Study Monitoring Plan  
The investigator will monitor data quality from his/her site on a regular basis throughout the 
study and monitor for compliance with the protocol, applicable government regulations, 
Good Clinical Practice, the site’ s standard operating procedures, and the local EC, when 
applicable.  The investigator will allocate adequate time for these monitoring activities.  
The investigator and institutions involved in the study will permit study -related monitoring 
by Corbus, gove rnment agencies and other regulatory groups, if requested and provide direct 
access to all study records at the site and to the facilities.  Adequate time and space for 
monitoring visits should be made by the investigator and site staff.  
Data quality will be monitored by Corbus on a regular basis throughout the study period. The 
electronic record will be monitored/audited for the purposes of the study.  A site monitor 
representing Corbus will visit study facilities at periodic intervals, in addition to main taining 
necessary contact through telephone, e -mail, and letter.  The monitor will assess: subject 
enrollment and informed consent procedures; investigational product storage, dispensing, 
administration and accountability; compliance with protocol procedur es; completeness and 
accuracy of data entered onto the EDC; and the occurrence of AEs.  All aspects of the study 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 99 of 122 will be carefully monitored for compliance with the protocol, applicable government 
regulations, GCP, and the site’s standard operating procedu res. 
The investigator or a member of the study team must be available to the monitor during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and review the subjects’ records (e.g., 
medical records, doctor office and hospital charts and study -related infor mation) for source 
data verification.  
The monitor will discuss the conduct and progress of the study with the investigator and site 
staff.  The investigator must cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems noted 
during monitoring are resolved.  
13.3.2  Audit and Inspection of Sites  
Participation by the investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
government regulatory authorities and applicable institutional compliance and quality 
assurance offices.  During the conduct of the study, Corbus may conduct audits of any data 
and facility participating in the study.  The investigators and institutions involved in the study 
will permit such study -related audits and provide direct access to all paper study records not 
contained within the electronic medical record or eCRFs and to the facilities.  The 
investigator must maintain a comprehensive and centralized filing system of all study -related 
documentation that is not part of the electronic medical record or eCRFs and that is suitable 
for inspection by Corbus or its designated site monitors, Quality Assurance monitors, EC 
representatives, and representatives of government regulatory bodies.  The investigators 
agree to participate in audits conducted at a convenient time in a reasonable m anner.  
Government regulatory authorities or representative from ECs may also perform inspections 
either during or after the study.  In the event of an inspection by any regulatory authority, the 
investigators will promptly notify Corbus and will allow Corb us representatives to be present 
during the audit, if permitted by the regulatory authority.  The investigators agree to 
cooperate fully with inspections conducted by regulatory authorities and to allow 
representatives of the regulatory authority access to  all study records.  The investigator will 
forward to Corbus a copy of any inspection records received.  
13.4 Data Management  
A Clinical Data Monitoring Plan will be created to specifically identify how data 
management will be performed for the study.  The following summarizes this plan:  
● The clinical database will be held and managed by an EDC vendor.  The EDC will be 
used for online edit checks, batch edit checks and query management  
● Data validation will be performed per the specifications in a Data Validat ion Plan.  
Within the Data Validation Plan, there will be validation checks:  
o Online checks performed by the EDC system during data entry  
o Batch edit checks  
o Manual checks performed by the site monitor and/or Data Management.  
Queries are handled within the ED C application.  The monitors and data managers can 
generate a query.  Under direction of the investigator, the site team addresses the query.  If 
the query is due to a data entry error, the site staff can immediately make the corrections in 
Lenabasum  Protocol Number: JBT101 -CF-002 
Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  05 NOV  2019 
CONFIDENTIAL  Version 3.4 
  Page 100 of 122 the applicable eCRF pages.  If the query needs clarification, the site staff contacts the 
investigator for resolution.  The Coordinator then enters the correct value or submits an 
answer to the query without modifying the data.  The monitor then reviews the corrected 
eCRF pages and/or answer.  If the data are changed correctly or the answer is acceptable, the 
monitor closes the query.  If the answer is not acceptable, the monitor submits an additional 
query for clarification.  All changes to the database require a “Reason  for Change” and are 
subject to an audit trail.  The audit trails identify the changed data, reason(s) for change, who 
changed the data and the time and date of the change.  
Centralized monitoring will be performed at an agreed -upon frequency as defined in the 
Clinical Monitoring Plan.  The sites will receive feedback about data quality and data 
management issues at their own sites.  Corrective actions will be implemented as necessary.  
Routine EDC management reports will be available to view the data for co nsistency. 
Additional management reports will be obtained and reviewed, as indicated during the study.  
13.5 Trial Master File  
The Trial Master File for Corbus will be maintained within an electronic document storage 
system using 21 CFR Part 11 compliant softwar e. 
13.6 Record Retention  
The investigator must ensure that the following records and documents pertaining to the 
conduct of the study and the distribution of study drug  are retained for as long as needed to 
comply with national and international regulations (ge nerally 2 years after discontinuing 
clinical development or after the last marketing approval): copies of the study specific 
documents and other sources of information such as original medical documents, data and 
records (such as hospital records, clinical  and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, 
documents regarding subject treatment and study drug  accountability, and original signed 
informed consents).  All EC records related to this investigation will be retained by the site 
for as long as required  by the local EC.  
In the event the investigator retires, relocates or for any other reason withdraws from the 
responsibility for maintaining records for the time required, custody of the records may be 
transferred to any other qualified person who will acc ept responsibility for the records.  
Notice of such a transfer must be given in writing to Corbus.  The investigator must contact 
Corbus before  disposal of any records related to this study.  No records will be destroyed 
without the written consent of Corb us, if applicable.  It is the responsibility of Corbus to 
inform the investigator when any study documents stored at his/her site no longer need to be 
retained.  
13.7 Confidentiality of Subject Data  
To maintain subject confidentiality, only a site number, subjec t number and subject initials 
will identify all study subjects on CRFs and other documentation submitted to Corbus.  
Additional subject confidentiality issues (if applicable) are covered in the Clinical Study 
Agreement.

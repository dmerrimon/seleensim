 1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 BACKGROUND  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become one of mos t important medical imaging 
tools over the past 30 years because it is non-invasive, requires no ionizing radiation, and 
provides exquisite images of soft tissues and anatomic structures with many tissue/disease specific contrasts. While MRI has served the community well for many years, it is increasingly clear that it also has significant limitations.  
 One of the principle limitations is the lack of quantitative information for tissue/structure 
characterization. The current paradigm of MRI is to use a set of scanner settings to generate 
an image "weighted" by a specific MR contrast mechanism (physical parameter), where it is hoped that variations in the parameter will be accentuated. However, without quantitative knowledge of the parameters, the final image contrast may depend on many factors, which complicates image interpretation and diagnostic performance. Quantitative measurement can provide a great deal of information about tissue properties and pathological conditions, since these parameters ultimately  determine the contrast that is observed in conventional images. 
 
1.2 RATIONALE  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate novel quantitative MRI techniques in clinical studies to determine whether they can provide better, faster and more useful information for clinical 
diagnosis. Quantitative MRI has been a continuous interest in the MRI community, but 
extremely challenging due to long acquisition times and sensitivity to motion. Recently, we have introduced a novel MRI data acquisition approach, namely MR Fingerprinting (MRF), for simultaneous measurement of several important parameters in a single MRI scan.  
 This work, recently published in Nature, has shown that accurate quantification of proton density, T1 and T2 relaxation times can be achieved which opens the door to rapid multi-parametric MR analysis and potentially leads to new diagnostic methodologies (4). Pilot studies with scans from hundreds of patients have demonstrated that the novel method can provide valuable information for various diseases in  brain, liver, and prostate (5–8). While it 
has shown great promise in these previous studies, clinical evaluation of this technique has been limited to a few medical centers worldwide due to the complexity in installation, implementation and  post-processing of the technique. 
 Dr. Yong Chen, a newly recruited faculty at Department of Radiology, is a key developer of the MR Fingerprinting technique (8–14). In this study, the investigators propose to apply this novel technique at UNC and evaluate its  performance for different diseases. These include 
but not limited to diseases in liver, kidney, cardiac, pancreas etc. The investigators hypothesis that the quantitative MR imaging technique will lead to improved tissue characterization and diagnosis.

 2 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
To determine the percent of p atients with a v isible region of i nterest . MR fingerprinting 
sequences will be examined to determine their utility for visualizing pathology. 
 
2.2 PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
The evaluat ion of novel quantitative MRI techniques in clinical studies to determine whether 
they can provide better, faster and more useful information for clinical diagnosis.  
3 ELIGIBILITY  
 
3.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA The study will include English-speaking patients, 18 and over, that are already scheduled to undergo a clinical MRI for diagnostic purposes.  
3.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA The study will exclude anyone under the age of 18 and pregnant women.  
 Women will be excluded from the healthy volunteers, due to a lack of funding for pregnancy testing. Funding for this will be considered for the future.  
4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 SCHEMA This is a one arm single center study of 105 par ticipant s scheduled to have a clinical MRI  
that consent to undergo an investigational MR Fingerprinting sequence.  The MR 
fingerprinting technique requires less than 15 minutes and will be added following the standard MRI sequence.  There will be 5 healthy male volunteers to practice using the 
sequence prior to imaging clinical patients.  
 
4.2 ENROLLMENT/RECRUITMEN T 
A total of 105 participants  will be enrolled to this study. The 100 study subjects will be 
consecutively recruited from patients  who are scheduled to undergo a clinical standard of 
care MRI for diagnostic purposes. There will be 5 healthy male volunteers to practice using the sequence prior to imaging clinical patients. Participant eligib ility will be identified by 
research staff review . Once a patient has been referred, the patient will be approached by a 
coordinator from Radiology to assess interest in participation.   All eligible patients  who agree to participate in the study will be asked to come to their 
scheduled MRI  appointment thirty minutes early to complete the informed consent process.   
 
Page | 5  
 Review of the consent will take place in the p rivacy of an exam room, or when possible, a 
sample consent form will be sent to the patient via email prior to the patient’s visit to allow 
for ample review. As t he investigational s equences are in addition to  the standard of care 
(SOC ) MRI  sequences , pati ents will follow the SOC guidelines.  Non -ionizing imaging, such 
as MRI (3T or less) or ultrasound, requires that the subject be questioned about pregnancy status using the pregnancy screening form and direct questioning. As an additional step, we 
as the study team will also question patients about their pregnancy status prior to enrolling in 
this study. If there is any question for women of childbearing potential, they will not be enrolled.  Once the patient has consented, they  will be escorted by the res earch coordinator to a 
dressing room, where the subject will change into appropriate clothing for scanning.    
4.3 STUDY DESIGN  
Investigational sequences will be developed at UNC. The study will be performed on either 1.5T or 3T MR scanners. Scanners at both field strengths are FDA approved and all new 
sequences possess the same safeguards as standard (FDA approved) clinical sequences to 
prevent harm to subjects. The study does not need any contrast administration unless it is required for standard clinical examination. For each consented subject, the additional scans will add no more than 15 minutes to the total scanning time.  The investigational MR protocol will be implemented on the existing MR scanners without any modifications to the existing, FDA approved machine, equipment, or safety standards. Patients will receive their standard of care imaging. In addition, they will receive the research sequence.  The additional sequences will be performed at no cost to the patient other than a small increase in the amount of time spent inside the MR scanner. The additional sequences are less than 15 minutes and do not place individuals at any increased risk. 
 
4.4 STUDY DURATION  
It is anticipated that the total clinical study duration encompassing recruitment, enrollment, 
and data analysis will take approximately 3 years . Active patient participation will last 
approximately 1 visit (consent and imaging).  
5 UNANTICIPATED CONCERNS  
 
5.1 UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT (UADE)  
The investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations define an unanticipated adverse 
device effect (UADE) as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects” (21 CFR 812.3(s)). 
Page | 6  
 5.2 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
As defined by UNC’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study subjects refers to 
any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol- related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.  
5.3 REPORTING  
 
5.3.1 Unanticipated A dverse D evice E ffects 
UADEs must be reported by the clinical investigator to the sponsor and the reviewing IRB, as described below:  
 
• For this device study, investigators are required to submit a report of a UADE to 
the FDA, the manufacturer of the device and the UNC IRB as soon as possible, 
but in no event later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the event (§ 812.150(a)(1)), using the MedWatch Form 3500A.   Sponsors  must immediately conduct an evaluation of a UADE and must report the results of the evaluation to FDA, the UNC IRB, and participating investigators within 10 working days after the sponsor first receives notice of the effect (§§ 812.46(b), 812.150(b)(1)). 
For this study, the additional sequences are less than 15 minutes and do not place 
individuals at any increased risk outside of their standard of care imaging. 
5.3.2 Unantici pated Problems 
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by UNC’s IRB 
must be reported by the Study Coordinator using the IRB’s web-based reporting system.    
6 ADVERSE EVENT (AE)/SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)  
 
6.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENT (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and  which does not  
Page | 7  
 necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product , whether or not related to 
the medicinal product.  
6.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that : 
i) results in death  
 
ii) led to a serious deterioration in health that either:  (1) results in a life -threatening illness or injury, or 
(2) results in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
(3) requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or 
(4) Results  in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life thr eatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
(5) Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 
iii) Led to fetal distress, fetal  death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
 
6.3 REPORTING ADVERSE/SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
IRB Reporting Requirements:  
• UNC will submit an aggregated list of all SAEs to the UNC IRB annually at the 
time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and procedures. 
 
• The UNC -IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an Unanticipated 
Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web-based reporting 
system (see section 8.2 ) within 7 days of the Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
 
7 DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING  
The new sequences will be examined to determine their utility for visualizing pathology; however, no formal comparisons with statistical analysis will be performed. This is a 
minimal risk study. All settings for the res earch sequence are within  the FDA guidance for 
not more than minimal risk (provided in the attachments). The additional sequences are less 
than 15 minutes and do not place individuals at any increased risk.  
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a nonrandomized, single-center study. The new sequences will be examined to determine their utility for visualizing pathology; however, no formal comparisons with statistical analysis will be performed.

 9 STUDY MANAGEMENT  
 
9.1 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) APPROVAL AND CONSENT  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance 
with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol. In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply 
with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP).  Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by the FDA Regulations and local or state regulations.  Once this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient 
will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by signing an IRB approved consent 
form.  Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the wr itten informed consent form should 
be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion.  
9.2 REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION  
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be pro vided 
to the Study Sponsor. 
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed consent 
• IRB membership list 
• CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator and any associate 
investigators who will be involved in the study 
• A copy of the IRB approved consent form 
 
9.3 ADHERENCE TO THE PROTOCOL  
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety, and well-
being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol.  
 
9.4 CONFLICT OF INTEREST  
Any investigator who has a conflict of interest (COI) with this study as defined by the policies of the University of North Carolina will have the conflict reviewed by a properly constituted Confli ct of Interest Review Committee with a committee -sanctioned conflict 
management plan that has been reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to participation in this study.  All University of North Carolina investigators will follow the University conflict 
of interest policy.

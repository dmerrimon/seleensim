PRECIS
Background:
xxPatients who have adva nced differentiated thyroid cancers (Stage IV) have a five-year 
survival of only 25%. Clinically this resu lts in more aggressive growth, metastasis, 
decreased or loss of iodine uptake in the tu mor, and tumors that may be refractory to 
conventional treatme nt: surgical resection, radioactiv e iodine treatment and thyroid 
hormone for TSH suppression. 
xIn thyroid cancer, valproic acid, at clin ically achievable concentrations, has an 
antiproliferative and differentiating effect. 
xWe hypothesize that valproic acid may inhi bit proliferation and induce differentiation 
in thyroid cancer cells so that 131-I may de tect residual disease and be more effective 
for radioiodine ablation of thyroid cancer cells of follicular cell origin.  
Objectives:
xThe primary goal of this study is to determine if valproic acid will have an 
antineoplastic and differentiati on effect in patients with ad vanced and or metastatic 
thyroid cancer of follicular cell origin. 
Eligibility:
xUnresectable advanced and or poorly differe ntiated thyroid cancers of follicular cell 
origin (excluding anaplastic and medullary  thyroid cancer) that have no uptake (<1%) 
on radioiodine scan or are unrespons ive to radioiodine therapy.  
xElevated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level (>100ng/ml on thyroid hormone; >10ng/ml 
off thyroid hormone).  
Design:
xThis will be an open label phase II study to assess the efficacy of valproic acid 
therapy as an antiproliferative and differentiation agent in patients with incurable differentiated thyroid cancer (unrespons ive and/or radioiodine negative and 
unresectable).
xOral valproic acid will be administered to reach a therapeutic serum level (50 to 100 
μg/ml).
xThe number of patients to be enrolled is 25 with an interim analysis of response once 
13 patients are evaluable for response. It is  anticipated that five patients may be 
enrolled per year.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 S TUDY OBJECTIVES
1.1.1 To determine if valproic acid will inhibit thyroid cancer  growth, as evidenced by a 
decrease in thyroglobulin level, and tumor size. 
1.1.2 To determine if valproic acid therapy will induce differen tiation of thyroid cancer cells 
and therefore increase uptake of radi oactive iodine by the tumor cells.  
1.1.3 To determine the effect of valproic acid on differentiation markers of thyroid cancer and 
global gene expression in thyroid tumor tissue.
1.2 B ACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
Thyroid cancer is the fastest growing cancer diagnosis in the U.S.1. Approximately 10-15% of 
patients present with aggressive disease and ha ve about a 30% mortality rate at 5-10 years 
following initial treatment 2. Patients with stage IV differentiate d thyroid cancer have a five-year 
survival of only 25%. In patients with progressi ve or recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer, 
one-third of patients develop or have dedifferentiated tumo rs (loss of differentiation) 3.
Clinically this results in more aggressive grow th, metastasis, decreased or loss of iodine uptake 
in the tumor, and tumors that may be refractor y to conventional treatme nt: surgical resection, 
radioactive iodine (RAI) treatme nt and thyroid hormone for TSH suppression.  In addition, up to 
20% of patients with differentiate d thyroid cancer have evidence of residual disease as indicated 
by detectable serum thyroglobulin levels but have negative RAI scans4.  Patients with 
differentiated thyroid cancer are usually treated af ter total or near total thyroidectomy with RAI
(I-131) in order to ablate any residual thyroid tis sue and/or cancer. Loss of iodine uptake makes 
RAI ablation therapy ineffective.  Further dedifferentiation of thyroid cancers of follicular cell origin, in about 1% of patients, leads to the fo rmation of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, which is 
uniformly lethal.
Valproic acid, a histone deacetyl ase (HDAC) inhibitor, has long been used as an anticonvulsant 
to treat seizures in patients with epilepsy.  It ha s also been used to treat bipolar disorder.  Recent 
studies have shown that this cl ass of drugs has promising effect s in the treatment of cancer by 
inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, inducing a poptosis, cell cycle arrest and differentiation in 
brain, hematologic, endometrial,  ovarian and prostate cancers 
5-8. Preclinical studies also suggest 
that valproic acid has a similar antiproliferative and differentiating effect in human thyroid cancer cells 
9-14.
Valproic acid interacts with the catalytic site of histone acetyltransferases to disrupt its activity.  
The post-translational modification process of acetylation is critical  to gene transcription, with 
increased acetylation resulting in increased ge ne transcription.  Because acetylation affects 
chromatin structure and nucleosomal packaging,  it affects gene expression through this 
Page 5 of 28

Version Date: 04/17/2015
mechanism. Approximately 2-5% of  transcribed genes are significantly affected after treatment 
with HDAC inhibitors.
In thyroid cancer, valproic acid, at concentrations clinically achievable, has an antiproliferative
and differentiating effect. At concentrations of 0.5 to 2.0mM, valproic acid inhibited growth by 
55 to 80% 9-14. Valproic acid also upregul ates sodium-iodine sympor ter (NIS) gene expression 
in dedifferentiated thyroid cancer cells12-14.  The NIS gene encodes the Na+/I- symporter, located 
on the basolateral membrane of follicular thyroid cells and is responsible for iodide uptake.
Downregulated NIS expression is the predominant mechanism of dedifferentiation in thyroid cancer cells of follicular cell origin that makes RAI ablation therapy ineffective.  Treatment with valproic acid increases iodide accumulation in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer cells by increasing the expression of the NIS gene.
Patients with differentiated thyroid cancers are routinely followed with serial thyroglobulin (Tg) 
levels, ultrasonography and RAI scans.  Recurrent or metastatic thyroid cancer of follicular cell 
origin is suspected by elevated serum Tg in the absence of RAI uptake on a diagnostic scan.  
Such "false negative" RAI scans occur in up to 20% of diagnostic RAI scans in patients with 
detectable Tg levels following thyroid abla tion and positron emission tomography (PET) is 
helpful in only a subset of cases for detecting resi dual disease. The prognosis for patients with 
thyroid cancer is related to the ability of the can cer to accumulate RAI, si nce well-differentiated 
thyroid cancers usually respond to treatment with RAI.  
We hypothesize that valproic acid may inhibit pr oliferation and induce differentiation in thyroid 
cancer cells so that 131-I may detect residual di sease and be more effective for radioiodine 
ablation of thyroid cancer cells of follicular cell origin (excluding anaplastic and medullary 
thyroid cancer) .  If our study demonstrates a tumor res ponse to valproic acid by decreased tumor 
size and/or decreased thyroglobulin and/or in creased radioiodine uptake in patients who are 
otherwise no longer amenable to  conventional therapy, we will have data to support conducting a 
large, multicenter, trial using valproic acid.
We will also perform correlative studies in tumor tissue biopsy samples to directly determine an 
effect of valproic acid on differentiation markers,  cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory genes, and 
genome-wide gene expression analysis.
1.3 S
TUDY DESIGN
This will be an open label phase II study to assess the efficacy of valproic acid therapy as an 
antiproliferative and differentiation agent in patients with incurable differentiated thyroid cancer (unresponsive and/or radioiodine  negative and unresectable). Pa tients with advanced thyroid 
cancers of follicular cell origin who have failed conventional therapy (including total thyroidectomy, I-131 ablation, with or without external radiation) who are thyroglobulin-
positive/radioiodine-unresponsive will be  eligible to enroll in this study.  The intervention plan 
will be to administer valproic aci d to all patients and then to co mpare serum thyroglobulin levels, 
radioiodine uptake and tumor size, by imaging st udies, before and after therapy, as well as, 
perform correlative tumor tissue studies.
Page 6 of 28
Abbreviated Title: VPA for Advanced Thyroid Cancer
Version Date: 04/17/2015
Valproic acid will be administe red at an initial dose of 500 mg daily, titrating to 1500 mg daily 
by week 2 and continuing for 10 weeks. Pa tients will then undergo imaging for response. 
Depending on the response, patient s will proceed to ablation, conti nue with an increased dose of 
valproic acid or be removed from treatment.  This dose and dosing schedule was chosen to 
obtain a concentration level known to have an antineoplastic effect ba sed on the fact that an oral 
dose of 500 mg twice daily should achieve plasma  concentrations of valproic acid typically 
ranging from 0.4-0.6mM. Valproic acid serum trough  levels will be obtaine d for all patients at 
the beginning of week 2 and then weekly therea fter to assess compliance, possible drug toxicity 
and to ensure plasma concentration is 50 to 100 μg/ml.
We will perform tumor tissue biopsy of the target lesions in patients with tumor that is accessible 
to percutaneous biopsy by ultrasound or CT scan guidance. This will allow us to determine if 
valproic acid has effects on differentiation, cell cycl e and apoptosis regulatory genes, as well as, 
genome-wide gene expression profile with valproic acid treatment. The correlative studies will then be evaluated based on response and therapeutic  serum valproic acid levels. (Study Schema

2 ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT AND ENROLLMENT
2.1 E
LIGIBILITY CRITERIA
2.1.1 Inclusion Criteria2.1.1.1 Advanced/poorly differentiated thyroid can cers of follicular cell origin that have no 
uptake (<1%) on radioiodine scan or are un responsive to radioiodine therapy.  
Unresponsiveness to radioiodine therapy is defined as a patient’s thyroglobulin not 
falling to less than 2ng/ml within 6 months after previous radioiodine ablative treatment.
2.1.1.2 Extensive (invasive) loco-regional tumor ma ss and/or metastatic  spread, rendering 
patient inoperable 
2.1.1.3 Thyroglobulin (Tg) levels greater than or equal to 100 ng/ml in the absence of Tg 
antibodies.  Patients who are Tg-antibody (Tg-Ab) positive may be included despite a 
lower Tg level if they have detectable di sease on cross sectional imaging.  (The 
presence of Tg-Ab may lead to falsely low Tg  levels and therefore render the Tg a less 
sensitive marker of disease.  However, Tg-Ab has been shown to also act as a tumor marker, and will be used as an endpoint for the study in patients who are Tg-Ab 
positive.) 
2.1.1.4 Within 18 months of enrollment, patients mu st have had an RAI scan, showing no or 
therapeutically insignificant RAI uptake  .

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 S TUDY DESIGN  
Current conventional therapy for patients with th yroid cancers of follicul ar cell origin after 
thyroidectomy and ablative treatment with 131-I involves only thyroid hormone for TSH 
suppression.  In this study, patie nts will receive TSH suppression therapy with valproic acid for 
16 weeks. 
The total study period will be 18 weeks, w ith a one year follow up. Patients who respond to 
treatment as evidenced by decreased Tg level, RAI uptake or decreased tumor size will continue treatment of valproic acid for 1 year.

5 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION
5.1 D ATA COLLECTION
Data will be collected using the NCI C3D web based data collection system.
All data will be kept secure. Personal identifiers will not be used when collecting and storing data. An enrollment log will be maintained in the regulatory binder/file which is the only location of personal identifiers with  unique subject identification number.
5.1.1 Routine Data Collection
Following enrollment, all adverse events will be described in the source documents and be 
reviewed by the designated research nurse, and captured in C3D.  
xFor laboratory values obtained at sites other than the NIH Clinical Center: 
only the following values (highest grade per cycle) will be captured in 
C3D:
oHemoglobin, total white blood ce ll count, absolute neutrophil 
count, platelet count
oCreatinine, ALT, AST, Total bilirubin, Total protein, Albumin, Alkaline phosphatase, Amylase, Ammonia and b-HCG (+/-) if 
appropriate.
oAny unexpected laboratory DEQRUPDOLW\JUDGHSRVVLEO\
probably or definitely related to the research
xDuring the follow up period (more than 30 days following the last 
treatment), only those events that ar e serious, unexpected, and related to 
the treatment will be captured in C3D. 
5.1.2 Exclusions to Routine Data CollectionThe following Adverse Events will be captured only in the source documents and will not be 
reported in C3D:
xLaboratory values that do not support the diagnosis of a reportable event
xAll grade 1 events
Page 17 of 28
Abbreviated Title: VPA for Advanced Thyroid Cancer
Version Date: 04/17/2015
5.1.3 Concomitant medications 
Only those medications that the patient is taking at baseline on a routine basis or medications that 
cause an AE will be captured in C3D.  {Thus onetime medications, PRN medications, and medications given to treat adverse events will not be captured in C3D.}
5.2 R
ESPONSE CRITERIA
RAI uptake and Tg level will be compared pre- and post-valproic acid treatment.  The nuclear 
medicine radiologists using a planar technique  will measure the RAI scan uptake.  The post-
valproic acid scan will then be compared side-to-side with the pre-valproic acid scan, using the planar technique, and will then be scored as "increased" or "unchanged" compared to 
zero/minimal (<1%) uptake seen on the pre-valproic acid scan.  We will define 4 categories of response:
1. Complete response: increased RAI uptake on post-valproic acid therapy at week 10, 
AND a decrease in Tg level to less than 2 ng/ml (or a decrease in Tg-Ab level to less than 
2.0 IU/ml) at 10 weeks AND disappearance of all lesions at 16 weeks.
2. Partial response:  increased RAI uptake on post-valproic acid scan at week 10, OR a 
decreased Tg level (or a decrease in Tg -Ab level by more than 20%) at 10 weeks AND 
30% decrease in target lesion at 16 weeks.
3. Stable disease: no change in RAI uptake AND Tg levels (or Tg-Ab level) AND no 
significant change of lesions 16 weeks.
4. Progressive disease: tumor mass increases OR  Tg levels (or Tg-Ab levels) increases over 
10 weeks OR at least 20% increase  in target lesion at 16 weeks.
Target lesions will be evaluated according t o the RECIST response criteria outlined below.
5.2.1 Response Criteria RECIST 1.1
5.2.1.1 Evaluation of target lesions
*
x Complete Response (CR):  Disappear ance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether ta rget or non-target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
x Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of 
diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
x Progression (PD):  At least a 20% in crease in the sum of diameters 
of target lesions taking as refere nce the smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or the appearance of one or more new lesions.
Page 18 of 28
Abbreviated Title: VPA for Advanced Thyroid Cancer
Version Date: 04/17/2015
x Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the 
smallest sum diameters while on study.
* All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) 
representative of all involved  organs should be  identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all organs involved, and be suitable for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).  A sum of the diameters (longest for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease.
5.2.1.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions**
x Complete Response (CR): Disappear ance of all non-target lesions 
and normalization of tu mor marker level. All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (<10mm short axis).
x Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesions 
and/or maintenance of tumour marker level above the normal 
limits.
x Progression (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions.  
Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions
** All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements 
are not required, and these lesions should be followed as “present”, “absent ”, or in rare cases “unequivocal progression.”
5.2.1.3 Evaluation of best overall response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both me asurement and confirmation criteria.
Target Lesions Non-Target Lesi ons New Lesions Overall Response

5.3 T OXICITY CRITERIA
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each 
patient while on the study.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE 
reporting. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 
4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40 ). 
5.4 S AMPLE STORAGE ,TRACKING ,AND DISPOSITION
Tumor tissue biopsy samples
Patients who have locoregi onal or metastatic dise ase that is amenable to ultrasound guided and 
or CT scan guided needle biopsy will have this done of the target lesi on. This will be performed 
at study entry and at 10 weeks. 
Immediate cytopathologic review will be performed to confirm the presence of tumor cells. 
The samples will then be stored in -80 qC until the immunohistochemistry studies and genome-
wide gene expression analysis.
The Na/I symporter expression level will be determined by quantitative RT PCR and 
immunohistochemistry (11-14). Gene ex pression levels (differentiation markers, cell cycle and 
apoptosis regulatory genes) changes with valproic acid treatment  will be determine by using 
pathway specific gene expression arrays (12,13).
Blood samples
The laboratory studies will be blinded to  the response of patients to therapy.
Samples will be sent to the Endocrine Oncology Laboratory for processing:
NCI Endocrine Oncology Branch Laboratory
CRC Room 4-5840
10 Center Drive, MSC 1201
Bethesda, MD  20892-1201
(301) 435-7891
At the completion of the protocol, the investigat or will dispose of all specimens in accordance 
with the environmental protection laws, regulati ons and guidelines of the Federal Government 
Page 20 of 28

and the State of Maryland.  Any unintentional loss or destruction of the tissue will be reported to 
the IRB.
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
6.1 R ATES AND TYPES OF RESPONSES
Rates and types of responses will be determined and presented with 95% confidence intervals.  
Patient characteristics (demographic and clinical) will be tabulated. Overall survival will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves.  Toxicities will be tabulated by grade and organ system. Summary responses to the quality of life instrument  at selected time point s will be tabulated; to 
aid in the interpretation of temporal changes in quality of life items, change scores will be evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank te st or McNemar’s test as appropriate.
6.2 S
AMPLE SIZE AND POWER ANALYSIS
This is a phase II study aimed at measuring th e impact of valproic acid on iodine uptake and on 
tumor response. Response will be de fined as complete or  partial response as outlined in section 
5.2. The study uses a two-stage Simon optimal design  with an interim analysis planned when 13 
patients are evaluable for response. If no comple te/partial responses are seen at that time the 
study will close to accrual. The study will proceed to stage II if at least one response is seen 
among the first 13 patients. At the end of stud y, if the cumulative number of responses among 
the 20 evaluable patients is 3 or more, valproic acid will be considered efficacious, while this will not be the case if 1-2 responses are noted.  Under the null hypothesis of a true response rate 
that does not exceed 5% (p0=0.05) , the two-stage de sign will control type I error (alpha)  to be 
no more than 7.4% , and when the true response rate  is at least 25% (p1=0.25), the study has at 
least 90% power (beta=0.10).   The probability of tr iggering early stopping is at least 51% if the 
true response rate is 5% or less, and less than 2.5% if the true  response rate is 25% or more.  If 
the accrual is stopped at the first stage due to futility, the upper bound of a 95% confidence 
interval for the response rate will be less than 25%. We will plan to enroll up to 25 patients with 
the expectation that 20 patients ( 80%) will be evaluable for response.
The stopping rule for Grade 3 toxicity is set at 15% as the acceptable toxicity rate because the 
study is designed to detect a treatment effica cy rate of 15% or higher. Therefore, if the 
acceptable toxicity rate is higher than the ex pected efficacy rate the study will be stopped.
7 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTIONS
7.1 R
ATIONALE FOR SUBJECT SELECTION
Subjects from both genders and all r acial/ethnic groups are eligible fo r this study if they meet the 
eligibility criteria.  To date, there is no inform ation which suggests that differences in drug 
metabolism or disease response would be expect ed in any one patient group. As advanced 
Page 21 of 28
Abbreviated Title: VPA for Advanced Thyroid Cancer
Version Date: 04/17/2015
thyroid cancers are rare in the pediatric popula tion, study will not include  patients < 18 years of 
age. 
7.2 P ARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN
As noted above, children under the age of 18 will not be enrolled. 
7.3 E VALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
Treatment with valproic acid may prove to be more effective th an current conventional therapy 
(thyroid hormone suppression) for advanced differ entiated thyroid cancers.  Patients with a long 
history of unresponsiveness to other treatment modalities (surgical debul king, thyroid hormone 
suppression, radioactive iodine, external beam ra diation) may experience an actual therapeutic 
benefit.  Risks include those associated with the agent, and standard imaging procedures for this 
disease entity.  Care will be taken to minimize si de effects, but they can be unpredictable in 
nature and severity.  This study may involve risk s to patients, which are currently unforeseeable.  
All patients will have laboratory tests to monitor for complications.  If patients suffer any physical injury as a result of the participation of this study, immediate medical treatment is available at the Clinical Cent er, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.  Although no 
compensation is available, any injury will be evaluated and treated in keeping with the benefits or care to which patients are en titled under applicable regulations.
7.4 R
ISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer of follicular cell origin have limited options available 
to them. Valproic acid is an approved agent for other indications and the toxicities have been well established.  The potential benefits of increased ability to diagnosis and treat residual malignancies in this pa tient population outweigh the risks of treatment with valproic acid. If 
this study demonstrates a tumor response to valp roic acid and/or increased  radioiodine uptake in 
patients who are otherwise no longer amenable to c onventional therapy, a large, multicenter, trial 
using valproic acid in this populati on of patients will be considered.
7.5 C
ONSENT AND ASSENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION
The investigational nature and obj ectives of this trial, the proced ures and treatments involved and 
their attendant risks and discomforts, potential benefits and potential alternative therapies will be carefully explained to the patient, and a signed informed consent document will be obtained by the PI, AI or clinical staff fellow.  
8 SAFETY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS/DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
PLAN
8.1 D
EFINITIONS
8.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the 
course of the clinical trial associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered related to the treatment or clinically significant. For this study, AEs will include events reported by the patient, as well as clinic ally significant abnormal findings on physical 
examination or laboratory evaluation. A new illness,  symptom, sign or clinically significant 
Page 22 of 28
Abbreviated Title: VPA for Advanced Thyroid Cancer
Version Date: 04/17/2015
laboratory abnormality or worsening of a pre-ex isting condition or abnormality is considered an 
AE.  
All AEs, including clinically significant abnor mal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution. Serious adverse events that occur more than 30 days after the last administration of investigational agent/intervention and have an attribution of at least possibly related to the agent/intervention should be recorded and reported 
as per section 8.2.
8.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.
8.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Reaction
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the sp ecificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not  required or available, is not cons istent with the risk information 
described in the general inve stigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
"Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are no t specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug und er investigation.
8.1.4 Serious
An Unanticipated Problem or Protoc ol Deviation is serious if it m eets the definition of a Serious 
Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.
8.1.5 Serious Adverse Event
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
xDeath,
xA life-threatening adverse drug experience
xInpatient hospitalization or prolon gation of existing hospitalization
xPersistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions
xA congenital anomaly/birth defect.
xImportant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, 
or require hospitalization may be c onsidered a serious adverse drug 
Page 23 of 28
Abbreviated Title: VPA for Advanced Thyroid Cancer
Version Date: 04/17/2015
experience when, based upon appropria te medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject a nd may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
8.1.6 Disability
A substantial disruption of a person’s  ability to conduct normal life functions.
8.1.7 Life threatening Adverse Drug Reaction
Any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that places the patient or subject, in the view of 
the investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it 
does not include a reaction that had it occurred in  a more severe form, might have caused death.
8.1.8 Protocol Deviation (NIH Definition)
Any change, divergence, or departure from the approved research protocol.
8.1.9 Protocol Non-compliance (NIH Definition)
The failure to comply with applicable NI H Human Research Protections Program (HRPP)
policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research 
subjects.
8.1.10 Unanticipated Problem
Any incident, experience, or outcome that:
xIs unexpected in terms of nature, se verity, or frequency in relation to 
(a) the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent doc ument; Investigator’s Brochure or 
other study documents, and(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND
xIs related or possibly related to participation in the research; AND
xSuggests that the research places subjects or others at a g reater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological , economic, or social harm) than 
was previously known or recognized

INTRODUCTION
We invite you to take part in a research study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
First, we want you to know that:
Taking part in NIH research is entirely voluntary .
You may choose not to take part, or you ma y withdraw from the study at any time.  In 
either case, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  However, to receive care at the NIH, you must be taki ng part in a study or be under evaluation for 
study participation.
You may receive no benefit from taking part.  The research may give us knowledge that 
may help people in the future.
Second, some people have personal, religious or  ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of 
medical or research treatments they would want to  receive (such as blood transfusions).  If you 
have such beliefs, please discuss them with your  NIH doctors or research team before you agree 
to the study.
Now we will describe this research study.  Before  you decide to take part, please take as much 
time as you need to ask any questions and discuss this study with anyone at NIH, or with family, friends or your personal physician or other health professional.  
Why is this study being done?
The purpose of this study is to see whether valp roic acid can inhibit tumor growth and/or induce 
tumor cell death and/or make tumo r cells take up radioiodine.  A lthough valproic acid is already 
approved by the FDA to treat epilepsy, it is not  approved for thyroid cancer and is therefore an 
investigational drug for research purposes.
Why are you being asked to take part in this study?
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have thyroid cancer that is either 
unresponsive or fails to absorb radioiodine.

What will happen if you take part in this research study?
Phase 1
Once we have determined that it is safe for you to participate in this trial you will be seen in 
clinic and will begin the first phase of this study.  You will continue on your thyroid hormone suppression therapy and you will begin valproic ac id.  You will start at a small dose and then 
increase the dose twice over the first week.  You will then have blood drawn to see if the amount 
of valproic acid in your blood is within th e correct limits. Th e research nurse will give you a 
diary to complete – this will include the doses of the medications you will be taking as well as a section to write down any side effects and a form for you to complete about how you are feeling. 
You will then be seen every 2 weeks for a total of 10 weeks.  On weeks 4 and 8 you may be seen by your local physician if that is more convenien t. At each clinic visit (both at home and at the 
NIH Clinical Center) you will have a physical exam, lab work and your diary will be reviewed 
and collected. On weeks 1, 2, 6, you will have additional blood drawn to check the amount of 
valproic acid in your blood and you will receive the valproic acid pills. 
On week 10, you will have another Thyrogen
®Scan done to measure radioiodine uptake after 
valproic acid therapy.  Pending the results of the Thyrogen®Scan, you will follow one of two 
schedules. Because valproic acid depresses the nervous system, you may not drink ANY 
alcohol while you are on this study.
Research Samples
If your tumor is easy to biopsy, we would like to take a biopsy and a blood sample before you 
begin treatment and again at week 10 to see if certain characteristics your tumor are changing in 
response to the valproic acid. A biopsy involves in serting a thin needle into your tumor while 
under an X-ray or ultrasound machine and removing  a small sample of the tissue.  Your doctor 
will explain the procedure to you and ask you to sign a separate consent.  If you do not want to have this biopsy done, you may s till participate in this study. 
Schedule 1
If there is increased radioiodine uptake on the post valproic acid Thyrogen ® Scan, you will 
receive treatment on Schedule 1 as described below.  
You will be prepared for radioiodine ablation therapy.  This is the same procedure which you 
have had in the past.  Your doctor will explain the procedure in detail and you will be asked to sign a separate consent.  Prior to the treatment you will stop your long acting thyroid hormone
and begin a short acting thyroid hormone. After 4 weeks, you will stop the short acting thyroid 
hormone and begin a low iodine diet.  Foods to av oid in a low-iodine diet include milk and other 
dairy products, commercial baked products (including most brea ds), seafood, red food dye #3, 
and salt which has iodine added to it. Your research nurse or dietitian will give you additional information about this diet.   During this period, y ou will be seen every 2 weeks either here at the

Clinical Center or by your home physician; the same as during the first 10 weeks of the study. 
After 2 weeks off of thyroid medication and a low iodine diet, you will receive radioiodine 
ablation therapy.  One week after therapy you will have a post radioi odine scan.  All the 
necessary blood work to prepare you for the ra dioiodine ablation therapy will be performed, 
including measuring your urine iodine and a pre gnancy test. After the scan, you will start back 
on thyroid hormone therapy at your previous dose.
Schedule 2: If there is no increased uptake on the post valproic acid Thyrogen ® Scan, you will receive 
treatment on Schedule 2 as described below. 
You will continue on valproic acid for 7 more week s. During this period, you will be seen every 
2 weeks either here at the Clinical Center or  by your home physician.  Following 16 weeks of 
treatment, your thyroglobulin and TSH will be measured and you will have scans performed. If 
you your thyroglobulin levels have decreased or the scans indicate that your tumor has shrunk, 
you will remain on the valproic acid for 8 additional months. 
Follow up:At 3, 6, 9 (for patients continuing on valproic acid only) and 12 months, you will have imaging 
studies done (an ultrasound, a CT and/or a MRI scan and PET scan), lab work and a physical 
exam.  This is considered standa rd follow up care for thyroid cancer.
Birth Control
If you are a woman who is breast feeding or pregnant, you may not take part in the study because 
valproic acid may cause harm to your unborn chil d and valproic acid is excreted in breast milk. If 
you are a woman who can become pregnant, or are the partner of a woman who can become 
pregnant, you will need to practice an effective form of birth control before starting study 
treatment, during study treatment, and for 3 months af ter you finish study treatment.  If you think 
that you or your partner is pregnant, you s hould tell your study doctor or nurse at once.  
Effective forms of birth control include :
xAbstinence 
xintrauterine device (IUD)
xhormonal [birth control pills, injections, or implants]
xtubal ligation
xvasectomy
Alternative Approaches or Treatments
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study? 
Instead of being in this study, you have these options :

xGetting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study
xTaking part in another study
xGetting comfort care, also called palliative care.  This type of care helps reduce pain, 
tiredness, appetite problems and other problems caused by the cancer.  It does not treat 
the cancer directly.  Instead, it tries to improve  how you feel.  Comfort care tries to keep 
you as active and comfortable as possible.
Please talk to your doctor about these and other options.
Risks or Discomforts of Participation
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in this study?
The risks of valproic acid are listed in the table below. The risk of somnolence and depression of 
your central nervous system increase gr eatly if you drink alcohol. Therefore, you may not 
consume any alcohol while you are taking valproic acid. While you are on this study, you 
should consult Dr. Kebebew or the research nurs e before taking any prescription or over the 
counter medications.
Likely Less Likely Rare but Serious
xSleepiness
xNausea 
xHeadachexVomiting
xAnorexia
xDizziness
xIndigestion
xMuscle weakness
xRash
xAbdominal painxLiver toxicity which 
could be mild to severe
Biopsy
The risks of a biopsy include bruising and discomfo rt at the biopsy site and rarely bleeding and 
infection.
Radiation
In addition, this research study involves expos ure to radiation from 2 CT guided biopsies.
This radiation exposure is not required for your  medical care and is for research purposes 
only. The amount of radiation you will receive  in this study is 0.290 REM which is below 
the guideline of 5 rem (or 0.5 rem in children) per year allowed for research subjects by the 
NIH Radiation Safety Committee.  The average person in the United States receives a radiation exposure of 0.3 rem per year from natu ral sources, such as the sun, outer space, 
and the earth's air and soil.  If you would lik e more information about radiation, please ask

   2 1. Introduction  
 
This document details the planned analyses for the FORWARD study, GMA- US-NEU-0206. 
This study  was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BOTOX® versus 
topi
ramate in adult patients with chronic migraine ( CM) and consists of a 28-day run-in period 
within a 6-we
ek screening window, followed by up to 36 weeks of study treatment, followed by 
up to 12 weeks of post-treatment follow-up. 
 
A clinical study report will be prepared for the primary analysis when all patients have 
completed a Week 36 office visit (or exited the study prior to reaching the primary endpoint). 
There will be a database lock for the primary analysis after Week 36. A final clinical study report 
will be prepared after the final database lock and completion of the planned statistical analyses. 
This analysis plan w
ill address both the primary analysis and the final analysis. 
2. Objectives  
 
The overall objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
prophylactic treatment with BOTOX and topiramate in adults with CM. 
 
3. Investigational Plan  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
 
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, post-authorization 
study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of BOTOX versus topiramate in adult 
patients with CM. The study consists of a pretreatment period lasting 4 weeks, a treatment period 
with BOTOX or topiramate treatment lasting up to 36 weeks, and a post-treatment follow-up 
period lasting 12 weeks (for patients receiving BOTOX) ( Figure 1 ). All randomized patients are 
to remain in the stud
y until Week 36; however, patients who discontinue topiramate treatment on 
or before
 Week 36 will switch over to treatment with BOTOX and remain in the study until 
Week 48. Therefore, a patient could remain in the study for a maximum of 54 weeks. Patients are 
required to maintain a daily electronic headache diary ( eDiary) during the entire study period 
(i.e., screening visit to exit visit). 
 
The pretreatment period consists of a screening visit that occurs within 6 weeks prior to D ay 1 
and a prosp
ective 28-day run-in period. The prospective run-in period should begin as soon as 
the patient completes the screening procedures. Patients who complete the run-in period and 
meet the presp
ecified entry criteria will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
BOTOX or topiramate. Approximately 400 patients (200 patients per arm) will be enrolled at 
approximately 40 US  sites. For data analysis purposes, the number of headache days during the 
first 28 c
alendar days of the screening period starting on the day of eDiary Touch device setup 
will serve as the “baseline” for calculating change from baseline for 28-day periods subsequent 
to each office visit. 

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   3  
The treatment period consists of patients receiving intramuscular ( IM) injections of either 
BOTOX 155 U approximately every 12 weeks or up to 100 mg/day of oral topiramate 
administere
d daily up to Week 36. Patients randomized to BOTOX will receive 3 treatment 
sessions of BOTO
X155 U (Day 1, Week 12 ± 7 days, and Week 24 ± 7 days) according to the 
fixed-site, fixed-dose injection paradigm. The final/exit visit for these patients will be at 
Week 36 (or approx
imately 12 weeks after the last injection). 
 
Patients randomized to receive topiramate treatment will receive up to 36 weeks of daily 
topiramate treatment. A stable topiramate dose of at least 50 mg/day is required (maximum 
100 mg/day). The final/exit visit for patients who complete topiramate treatment will be at 
Week 36. Patients who di
scontinue topiramate treatment on or before the W eek 36 visit will 
return to the
 office approximately every 12 weeks (up to and including the Week 36 visit) to 
receive
 BOTOX 155 U, for a maximum of 3 BOTOX treatment sessions in the study. The 
final/exit visit for patients who discontinue topiramate and subsequently receive BOTOX will be 
at Week 48 (or approximately 12 weeks after the last injection).

   4 3.2. Study Endpoints  
 
Baseline for all eDiary efficacy endpoints is defined as the first 28 calendar days of the screening 
period starting on the
 day of eDiary Touch device setup and will be referred to as the baseline 
period. Baseline assessments for non-daily eDiary data (e.g., Headache Impact Test [HIT-6], 
Assessment of Chronic Mig
raine – Impact [ACM- I], and Controlled Oral Word Association Test 
[COWAT
]) will be collected on the day of randomization and will be referred to as Day 1.  
  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with a ≥50% decrease from 
the baseline pe
riod in the frequency of headache days per 28-day period, at the primary 
timepoint of W eek 32 (defined as the 28-day period ending with W eek 32). 
 
S
econdar
y Efficacy Endpoints   
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
1. Change from the baseline period in the frequency of headache days per 28-day period 
ending with Wee
k 32. This endpoint will be derived from the daily eDiary reports. It will 
be based on the count of
 headache days, defined as a calendar day (00:00 to 23:59), with 
at least 4 continuous hours in t
otal duration of headaches, and/or headache of any 
duration with the use of migraine-specific acute headache medication(s) (ie, ergot 
alkaloids, ergot combinat
ions, opioids, serotonin receptor agonists [“triptans”], or 
combination analgesics [simple analgesics combined with opioids or barbituates with or 
without caffeine]).  
2. Change from baseline Day 1 (randomization) in total HIT-6 score per 28-day period 
collected a
t Week 30. 
3. Proportion of patients with a ≥70% decrease from the baseline period in the frequency of 
heada
che days per 28-day period, at the primary timepoint of Week 32 (defined as the 28-
day period endin
g with Week 32). This responder endpoint will be derived from the 
underlying p
rimary variable of headache days.

3.3. Treatments   
Patients randomized to receive BOTOX will receive 3 treatment sessions of BOTOX over the 
course of the treatment period, ie, at Day 1, Week 12 ±  7 days, and W eek 24 ±  7 days. During 
each of the treatment sessions, each patient will receive a dose of 155 U BOTOX administered as 
31 fixed-site
, fixed-dose IM injections across 7 specific head/neck muscle areas (ie, the US 
labeled injection para
digm; BOTOX® US package insert, 2015 ). 
 
Topiramate will be provided for oral administration as 25-mg tablets in 60 tablet count bottles. A 
sufficient supply 
will be provided to ensure a 13-week supply. 
 

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   6 3.4. Dose Adjustment/Modifications 
 
Patients randomized to receive topiramate will receive up to 36 weeks of daily treatment. 
There will be a 4-week titration phase starting on Day 1 (randomization), followed by a dose 
maintenance phase for the remainder of topiramate treatment. At the Day 1 office visit, patients 
will receive an initial dose of topiramate 25 mg/day and will be instructed to continue this dose 
for 1 week. Patients will be instructed that, during the next 3 weeks of the titration phase, the 
topiramate dose should be increased in weekly increments of 25 mg/day until a dose of 100 
mg/day (or a lower maximum tolerated dose) is reached. Upon discussion with the investigator, 
the patient may
 also decrease the dose until the topiramate dose is optimized. Starting at Week 2, 
topiramate will be administered in 2 divided doses (morning and evening dose). Starting at 
Week 4 (ie, the
 maintenance phase), a stable topiramate dose of at least 50 mg/day is required. 
As per the recommended topiramate dose for migraine prophylaxis, the topiramate dose must not 
exceed 100 mg/day (Topamax® US package insert, 2012). At the next scheduled office visit (ie, 
Week 12), the investi
gator, at his/her discretion, may adjust the topiramate dose (upward or 
downward) to be within the range of 50 to 100 mg/day; the patient should remain on this dose for 
the remainder of topiramate treatment in the study. For all patients who complete or discontinue 
from treatment, a dose taper period of up to 2 weeks is recommended. 
 
Patients who discontinue topiramate at any time on or before Week 36 will receive treatment 
with BOTOX 155 U for t
he remainder of the study. The first BOTOX treatment will be 
administered during the office visit, and the patient will return every 12 weeks up to and 
including the Week 36 visit to receive BOTOX treatments, with a final exit visit at Week 48. 
BOTOX treatm
ent can be initiated during the topiramate dose tapering period. A patient who 
discontinues topiramate e
arly will be considered a nonresponder even if they receive BOTOX 
treatment.  
 
BOTOX treatment is administered by the physician per protocol and according to the BOTOX® 
US package insert, 2015 , thus dose adjustment/modification will not be made. As with a 
topiramate patient who discontinues treatment, a patient who discontinues BOTOX early will be 
considered a nonresponder. 
 
4. General Statistical Considerations  
 
 
 
Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, n, mean, standard deviation 
[SD], median, mi
nimum, and maximum). Categorical data will be summarized using the patient 
count and percentage in each category. Confidence intervals (CIs) will be 95% and 2-sided, 
unless otherwise stated. Data w
ill be displayed in all listings sorted by treatment group and 
patient number. P-values will be rounded to three decimal places. If a p-value is less than 0.001 it 
will be reported 
as “<0.001.” If a p-value is greater than 0.999 it will be reported as “>0.999.” 
Data will be displ
ay
ed in all listings sorted by treatment group.  

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   7  
Patients will be identified in the listings by the patient identification number concatenated with 
the investigator number. 
 
When count data are presented, the percentage will be suppressed when the count is zero in order 
to draw attention to the nonzero counts. A row denoted “Missing” will be included in count 
tabulations specified on the shells to account for dropouts and missing values. The denominator 
for all percentages will be the number of patients in that treatment group within the analysis set 
of interest, unless otherwise specified. Nonzero percentages will be rounded to one decimal 
place, except 100%, which will be displayed without any decimal places. Additional rounding 
rules are as follows: 
 If the original value has 0 decimal places: mean, median, and CIs will have one decimal 
place
 and SD will have 2 decimal places 
 If the original value has 1 decimal place: mean, median, and CIs will have 2 decimal 
place
s and SD will have 3 decimal places 
 If the original value has 2 or more decimal places: mean, median, CIs, and SD will all 
have 3 decimal places 
 
Minimum and ma
ximum will always have the same decimal places as the original value, up to a 
maximum of 3 decimal places. 
 
Visit labels will be assigned to each post-baseline record based on the windows or intervals for 
study day relative to the date of first dose ( Table 1). A r ecord with a study day closest to the 
target visit da
y will be chosen when multiple records fall in the same visit window. In case of a 
tie, the record with the earlier date will be chosen. Records that are not chosen will be treated as 
unscheduled assessments and will still be included in all analyses except ‘by visit’ analyses. If 
Day 1 is missing, the closest visit on or before the date of first dose will be used as baseline. 
Only nominal/scheduled visit data will be reported in the tables. All visits, including 
unscheduled visits, will be presented in the listings.

   8 For the e-diary data used to produce the headache endpoints, th e intervals specified in Table 2  
will be used. Baseline for the eDiary data is defined as the number of headache days during the 
28 day run-
in period. This run-in period will be the first 28 calendar days of the screening period 
starting on the day of eDiary Touch device setup.

4.1. Sample Size 
 
Approximately 400 patients (200 per arm) are required to provide 90% statistical power to detect 
an expected treatment difference of 16%. This calculation assumes a topiramate responder rate of 
28% and a B
OTOX responder rate of 44% at the primary timepoint of Week 32. A responder is 
defined as ha
ving a ≥50% decrease from baseline in the frequen cy of headache days per 28-day 
period. The a
bove calculations were based on a 2-sided test at alpha = 0.05, using the 
commercial software nQuery Advisor version 6.01, procedure PTT1 for a two-group continuity 
corrected Chi-squared test of equal proportions, with equal sample sizes. 
 
The assumed responder rate for BOTOX was estimated from 2 Allergan Phase 3 double-blind, 
placebo-controll
ed studies which reported observed rates of 43.5% (113/260), 50.5% (141/279), 
and 47.1% (254/539) fo
r Study 191622-079, Study 191622-080, and their pooled/combined data, 
respectively, at the primary timepoint of Week 24 (Aurora et al, 2010; Diener et al, 2010). At 
Week 32, the observe
d rates were 55.7% (141/253), 61.7% (161/261), and 58.8% (302/514), 
respectively. The corresponding rates for the Intent- To-Treat (ITT ) analysis where patients who 
terminated from the study were treated as failures were reported as 41.3% (141/341), 46.4% 
(161/347), and 43.9% (3
02/688), respectively. Based on these 2 studies, the BOTOX responder 
rate for an ITT analysis at Week 32 ranged from 41.3% to 46.4%, and the value of 44% was 
chosen as re
asonable for the purposes of sample size calculation for the current study. 
 

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   9 The topiramate responder rate was estimated from 2 published articles. A double-blind, placebo-
controlled st
udy with combination therapies, topiramate + placebo (n = 95) and topiramate + 
propranonol (n = 96) is described in Silberstein et al, 2012. The observed responder rates for 
≥50% decrease in headache days from baseline reported at Week 24 were 28% (23/82) and 31% 
(26/84), respectively, for the 2 treatment groups. These rates correspond to 24% and 27%, 
respectively, for an ITT analysis where patients who terminate from the study are treated as 
failures. R
othrock et al, 2005 also describes an open-label study involving topiramate (n = 170), 
where a r
esponder rate (≥50% reduction from baseline) of 38.8% (45/116) was reported. This 
rate corresponds to 29.4% for an ITT analysis where patients who terminate from the study are 
treated as fa
ilures. Thus, the ITT responder rate for topiramate ranged from 24% to 29.4%, and 
the value of 28% was deemed reasonable for sample size calculation purposes. 
 
4.2. Randomization
, Stratification, and Blinding 
 
On Day 1, qualified patients will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 treatment allocation ratio to 1 of 
2 treatment arms: 155 U BOTOX given IM or up to 100 mg/day of oral topiramate. 
 
Randomization is not stratified for this study. 
 
At the screening visit, once informed consent is obtained, the site staff will log onto the 
interactive web response system (IWRS) to obtain a unique patient number, which will be used 
as identification for the electronic patient eDiary, electronic case report form (eCRF), electronic 
clinical outcomes assessments (eCOA), and all source documentation throughout the study. 
 
The IWR
S system will provide the site with the treatment assignment to which the patient is 
assigned. Sites will dispense study medication according to the IWRS instructions. Sites will log 
onto the IWRS at subsequent visits to log dispending of additional study medication as needed. 
Sites will receive the IWRS confirmation notifications for each transaction. All notifications are 
to be maintained with the study source documents. 
 
4.3. Analysis
 Sets 
4.3.1.  Intent- to-Treat 
 
The ITT Set will include all randomized patients.  
 
4.3.2.  Subset of ITT 
 
A subset of the ITT Set (ssITT) will exclude patients who discontinue treatment for any reason 
other than the foll
owing : AE, lost to follow-up, lack of efficacy, C-SSRS response of “yes” to 
questions 4 or 5 in the suicidal ideation section or “yes” to any question in the suicidal behavior 
section, or noncompliance with the study treatment regimen.

ssITT set analyses will be performed only as needed which will be determined when number of 
subjects in thi
s population will be known. 
4.3.3. Per Protocol 
 
The P
er Protocol ( PP) S et will be a subset of patients in the ssITT Set who complete the study 
without major protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations include one or more of the 
following cate
gories: major inclusion/exclusion criteria violations, poor study drug compliance, 
and other. The prespecified criteria for exclusion from the per protocol set are detailed in Section 
115.1, and will be finalized prior to the database lock following the completion of the final post-
treatm
ent follow-up visit. 
 
PP set analyses will be performed only as needed which will be determined when number of 
subjects in this population will be known. 
 
4.3.4. Safety 
 
The S
afety Set will include all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.  
 
5. Patient
 Dispositio
n 
 
Patient disposition will be summarized for all enrolled patients and will include the number and 
percentage of patients for the following categories: patients randomized, patients treated (Safety 
Set), patients in the ITT Set, patients in the ssITT S et, patients in the PP Set, patients completed 
(study treatm
ent and study), patients who discontinued study treatment (including patients who 
discontinued from topiramate and switched to BOTOX), and patients who discontinued from the 
study. Denomina
tors for percentages will be the total number of patients randomized into each 
treatment arm, and overall.  
 
The reasons for
 study treatment discontinuation and study discontinuation will also be 
summarized in t
his table. The reasons for treatment discontinuation may include any of the 
following: AE, death, lost t
o follow-up, withdrawal of consent, patient became pregnant, 
includes non-compliant with study treatment regiment, treatment was ineffective, treatment was 
no longer needed, existed study due to C-SSRS or other. The reasons for discontinuation will be 
counted in the treatment arm for which the patient was receiving treatment at the time of 
discontinuation. The
se treatment arms will include BOTOX, topiramate, and 
topiramate +
 BOTOX. 
 
All patient dispositi
on data will be presented in a listing

   11 5.1. Protocol Deviations 
 
Protocol deviations will be documented by the clinical trial manager and reviewed monthly. 
They will be categorized as major and minor, and major deviations that would exclude patients 
from the PP
 analysis set will be identified and finalized prior to database lock in accordance with 
Internationa
l Council for Harmonisation guideline - E9 (Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials). 
Major protocol de
viations include but are not limited to: 
 
 Violation of any  inclusion/exclusion criteria 
 Poor study drug compliance 
 Othe
r protocol deviations as defined by clinical review 
 
Major protoc
ol deviations will be summarized for the ITT Set. Patients will be counted in the 
treatment arm to which they were randomized. Counts and percentage of patients with each type 
of deviation will be provided. Denominators for percentages will be the total number of patients 
randomiz
ed into each treatment arm or overall. 
 
All protocol deviations will be presented in a data listing. 
 
5.2. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
The demographic characteristics consist of age (years), age categories, sex, race, and ethnicity. 
The patient’s age in years is recorded at screening. Age will be categorized as follows: 18 to <25, 
25 to <35 years, 35 to <45 years, 45 to <55 years, and ≥55, and <40 years and,  40 years. Race 
categories will be reported as White, Black, Asian, Hispanic and Other. The baseline 
characteristics consist of baseline height, baseline weight, and baseline body mass index (BMI) 
(kg/m2). Body mass index is calculated as body weight in kilograms/(height in meters)2. 
 
A summar
y of demographics and baseline information will be presented for the ITT, ssITT, and 
PP Sets. Patients will be counted in the treatment arm to which they were randomized. All 
continuous data w
ill be summarized using descriptive statistics. Counts and percentage of 
patients for will be provided for all categorical data. Denominators for percentages will be the 
total number of patients randomized into each treatment arm or who received topiramate + 
BOTOX. 
 
All patient demographics and baseline characteristics will be presented in a data listing. 
 
5.3. General Medical History 
 
Medical history will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). The Safety Set will be used to summarize medical history overall (patients with any 
medical history
) and for each system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). Patients will be 
counted in the treatment arm to which they were randomized. Counts and percentage of patients 

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   12 with each type of SOC and PT will be provided. Denominators for percentages will be the total 
number of patients randomized into each treatment arm, overall. 
 
All patient medical history data including specific details will be presented in a listing. 
 
5.4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria can be found in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4 of the protocol. A 
listing of patients not satisfying all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be presented in a listing. 
In
clusion/exclusion exemption along with the reason for the exception will also be presented in 
this listing
. 
 
6. Prior and Concomitant Treatments  
 
A prior treatment is defined as any treatment that is started prior to the first dose of study drug. A 
concomitant tre
atment is defined as any treatment that has a start date and a stop date that is on 
or after the date of first dose of study drug. Treatments with start and stop dates that bracket the 
first dose da
te will be summarized as both a prior and c oncomitant treatment. 
 
All treatme
nts being taken by the patients upon entry into the study or a t any time during the 
study (in addition to the investigational product) are regarded as concomitant treatments and 
must be documented on the appropriate section of the eCRF. Prior and concomitant medications 
will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary. The total number of 
concomitant medica
tions and procedures and the number and percentages of patients with at 
least one concomitant me
dication will be summarized by treatment arm. The number and 
percentages of all concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment arm and listed by 
drug class and preferred term and will be flagged as prophylactic or acute headache medications, 
if applicable. All summaries will be performed using the Safety Set. Patients will be counted in 
the arm in which they
 received treatment. Denominators for percentages will be the total number 
of patients treated in each treatment arm and overall. 
 
All prior and concomitant medications as well as concomitant non-drug therapies, surgeries, and 
procedures will be presented in listings. 
 
7. Study Treatment  
7.1. Duration of Exposure 
 
Duration of exposure is defined as the total number of days a patient is exposed to any study 
drug. For topiramate it will be presented as the total number of days from the first dose date 
(Day
 1) to the last dose date (date of last dose minus the date of first dose + 1) as recorded on the 
End of Study/Ear
ly Withdrawal page on the eCRF. If the last dose date on the End of 

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   13 Study/Early Withdrawal page is missing, or if a patient is lost to follow-up, but the eDiary 
confirms that t
he patient has taken study drug, the visit date following the last completed eDiary 
entry will be used. For BOTOX the duration of exposure will be defined as the total number of 
days from the first injection date (Day 1) to the last injection date plus 84 days (date of last dose 
+ 84 days mi
nus the date of first dose + 1) as recorded in the eCRF. 
 
The durati
on of study drug exposure will be summarized for the Safety Set. Patients will be 
counted in the treatment arm for which they received treatment. Denominators for percentages 
will be the total number of patients treated in each arm. 
 
 
7.2. Treatment Compliance and Modifications 
 
Over the course of active treatment, each patient receiving topiramate will record the total daily 
dose taken in the eDiary system. If a patient skips a dose(s) or fails to take the specific 
maintenance dosing regimen, the patient will still be able to continue in the study.  
 
Topiramate treatment compliance will be calculated based on the e-dairy data and if necessary, 
corresponding pill counts (number of pills actually taken, number of pills retrieved/returned, and 
the number of pills expected to have been taken by the patient while in the topiramate arm of the 
study). The overall topiramate compliance rate will be calculated by dividing the total mg of 
topiramate taken 
after Week 12 visit by the total mg of topiramate prescribed for all visits after 
Week 12 visit base
d upon the duration in the study and then multiplying by 100. The total mg of 
topiramate pres
cribed will be based on the maintenance dose set during the Week 12 visit.  
 
The BOTOX compliance rate per visit will be calculated by choosing the minimum of the total 
units of BOTOX received at a visit divided by 155 U, the total number of injections sites divided 
by 31, 0.90 if a patient is +/- 8 to 10 days from the visit schedule or 0.80 if a patient is +/- 11 to 
14 days from t
he visit schedule. This minimum value will then be multiplied by 100%. A patient 
that is 15 or more da
ys from the visit schedule will result in a 0% for compliance ( Table 3) . The 
visit schedule is Day 1, Day 84 and Day 168. Overall BOTOX compliance will be the average of 
the total compliance from each visit.

For both the BOTOX and topiramate treatment arms, the number and percentage of patients in 
each compliance rate category (<80%, 80% – 100%, 100% – 120% and >120% as well as < 80% 
and ≥80%) will be
 reported. If the treatment compliance is less than 80% or greater than 120% 
and treatment discontinuation is reported at the subsequent office visit, then date of last treatment 
taken/rec
eived from either the eCRF or the eDiary will be the reported as date of discontinuation. 
Percentages will be calculated from the number of patients who have received treatment in the 
study period. 
 
If a patient discontinues topiramate treatment, the eCRF for treatment discontinuation must be 
completed to document the reason for discontinuation. The patient should not be exited from the 
study, because BOTOX must be administered at the next scheduled office visit (ie, Week 12, 24, 
or 36). 
 
If a patient discontinues BOTOX treatment, the eCRF for treatment discontinuation must be 
completed to document the reason for discontinuation and the patient will be exited from the 
study. 
 
Treatment compliance will be summarized for the Safety Set. Patients will be counted in the 
treatment arm in which treatment was received. The study drug compliance rate will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. Counts and percentage of patients in each compliance 
rate category will be provided. Denominators for percentages will be the total number of patients 
who received treatment in each treatment arm and overall. 
 
BOTOX treatment administration by visit, topiramate drug accountability, and topiramate drug 
accountability per eDiary will be presented in data listings. 
 
8. Efficacy Analyses 
 
All efficacy analyses will be conducted by grouping patients according to the treatment they 
were randomized to receive. The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed on 
the ITT Set. These analyses will be repeated for the ssITT and PP analysis sets. The primary 
indicator of efficacy for this study is the analyses on the ITT Set. The analyses for the ssITT and 
PP Sets will
 be considered supportive.   
 
Family-wise error rate will be controlled using a hierarchical testing gatekeeping procedure. The 
testing will begin with the primary efficacy endpoint and continue with the first secondary 
endpoint in the r
anking order, followed by the next, and so on, in a sequential fashion. If the test 
of the primary endpoint shows statistical significance at the 0.05 level (2-sided), then there is 
justification to proce
ed to test the next endpoint in the ranking order; this stepwise process 
continues for all the endpoints listed in the hierarchical order. However, if no statistical 

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   15 significance is shown at the 0.05 level (2-sided) for the test of any specified endpoint in the 
hierarchica
l order, then that endpoint and all subsequent endpoints below this in the ranking 
order should be not be considered as an indicator of efficacy, but rather should be considered 
supportive, regardless of their nominal p-value. 
 
For effica
cy analyses, patients who discontinue topiramate and then receive BOTOX will be 
considered non
responders and baseline data will be used for the remaining study days for the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
 
All efficacy data will be provided in data listings. 
 
8.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
 
The primary efficacy measure is the proportion of patients with a ≥50% decrease from baseline 
in the frequency of headache days. 
 
A headache day will be defined as a calendar day (00:00 to 23:59) with 4 or more hours of 
headache and/or headache of any duration with the use of migraine-specific acute headache 
medication(s) (
ie, ergot alkaloids, ergot combinations, opioids, triptans, or combination 
analgesics [simple analgesics combined with opioids or barbiturate with or without caffeine]). 
This variable is derived from the eDiary reports of total duration of all headaches for a given day. 
It is base
d on the count of days with at least 4 hours total duration of headaches and/or headache 
of any dura
tion with the use of migraine-specific acute headache medication(s). The primary 
timepoint is Week 32, encompassing the last 28-day period ending with Week 32 
(ie, Day 198 to Day 225, inclusive, following the Day 1 office visit). 
 
8.1.1.  Primary Analysis 
 
Missing data 
 
If there are at least 20 days for which the patient has reported headache data (for either headache 
days or headache-free days), but less than 28 days in a diary period, the data for counts will be 
prorated accordingly and rounded to the nearest whole number. The prorating will be based on 
the number of days with reported data in that period. 
 
For example, if there are 24 days with reported data in a 28-day diary window, the headache day 
count will be multiplied by 28/24 and rounded to a whole number. If the patient reported total 
daily headache durations that indicated 16 headache days and 8 headache-free days, the patient’s 
standardized counts after prorating by 28/24 would be 19 headache days and 9 headache-free 
days. 
 
If a patient reports eDiary data for less than 20 days in a 28-day period, the patient’s entries for 
this time period w
ill be set to missing. 

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   16  
A baseline observation carried forward (BLOCF) method will be utilized to impute missing 
values for the
 primary analysis. This type of imputation replaces the missing value with the 
baseline value; thus, if a patient has a missing entry for any reason (eg, discontinuation due to 
AE, lost to  follow-
up, lack of efficacy), the baseline value data will be utilized and the patient 
will be c
onsidered a nonresponder. Patients who discontinue BOTOX and patient randomized to 
topiramate
 who discontinue treatment and subsequently receive BOTOX will be considered 
nonresponders 
for the primary and secondary analyses and thus baseline value data will be 
utilized.
 
 
BLOCF will also be used to impute missing values for the PRO analyses. 
 
Analysis method 
 
The primary null hypothesis is that BOTOX and topiramate are equally effective, as measured by 
the proportion of pati
ents with a ≥50% decrease from baseline in the frequency of headache days 
per 28-day period at Week 32. The alternative hypothesis is that BOTOX has a different effect 
than topiramate. 
 
The prima
ry comparison between treatment arms will be performed using a logistic regression 
model, adjusted by the baseline number of headache days as a covariate. The treatment effect 
will be summarized using an adjusted odds ratio and 95% Wald confidence limits. The p-value 
from the Wald Chi-square test will also be reported. A 2-sided test with a p-value less than or 
equal to 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. All centers will be pooled for this 
analysis
. 
 
The primary analysis will be repeated for the PP and ssITT Sets, if appropriate.  
 
8.1.2. Sensitivity Analysis 
 
Se
nsitivity analyses of the primary variable will be performed for the ITT Set in the following 
ways: 
1. R
epeating the primary analysis using Fisher’s exact test. 
2. The same logistic regression methods but applying the Worst Observation Carried Forward 
(WOCF) imputation method for missing values when there are less than 20 days of reported 
data in the eDiar
y. Specifically, this will use a patient’s wor st-case observation within the 
28-day period to populate the missing values within that time period.  
3. The same logistic regression methods will be re-calculated on “observed data” (ie, without 
imputation for
 missing counts when there are less than 20 days of reported data).  
 
A sensitivity analysis will also be performed for the PRO variables to determine if there is a 
differenc
e in the imputed data versus the observed data. Continuous data will be analyzed with a 
t-test and Fisher’s exact test will be used for the categorical data.  

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   17 8.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
 
The 3 secondary efficacy variables are ranked in a hierarchical order of clinical importance. To 
control for Type I error rate for multiple secondary endpoints, a hierarchical testing gatekeeping 
procedure
 will be used, starting with the first secondary endpoint in the ranking order, followed 
by the next, and so on, in a sequential fashion. If the test of the first secondary endpoint shows 
statistical significance at the 0.05 level (2-sided), then there is justification to proceed to test the 
next endpoint in the ra
nking order; this stepwise process continues for all the endpoints listed in 
the hierarchica
l order. However, if no statistical significance is shown at the 0.05 level (2-sided) 
for the test of any
 specified endpoint in the hierarchical order, then that endpoint and all 
subsequent endpoints below this
 in the ranking order should not be considered statistically 
significant, re
gardless of their nominal p-value.  
 
1. Change from baseline in the frequency of headache days per 28-day period.  
This variable
 will be derived from the daily eDiary reports. It will be based on the count 
of headache days with at least 4 continuous hours in total duration of headaches, and/or 
heada
che of any duration with the use of migraine-specific acute headache medication(s) 
(ie, ergot alkaloids, ergot combinations, opioids, serotonin receptor agonists [“triptans”], 
or combination analgesics [simple analgesics combined with opioids or barbituates with 
or without c
affeine]) days per 28-day period at Week 32. 
 
The change
 from baseline in frequency of headache days will be compared between 
BOTOX and topiramate arms via analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline 
headac
he day count as the covariate. The estimated mean change from baseline and 95% 
CIs will be sum
marized for each treatment along with the 2-sided p-value. If the p-value 
is less than or equal to 0.05 then it will be considered as statistically significant and 
testin g will continue 
to the next secondary efficacy analysis. The rules for data handling 
and missing value imputation will be the same as used for the primary endpoint. 
 
2. HIT-6 Score change from baseline  
The H
IT-6 comprises 6 items that assess pain, role functioning, social functioning, 
cognitive functioning, vitality, and psychological distress. A total score is created by 
summing across all items, and ranges from 36 (no impact) to 78 (severe impact), 
reflecting a “best to worst” scoring. Score categories are based on the total score and 
include “little to no impact” (total score 36 to 49), “some impact” (total score 50 to 55), 
“substantial impact” (total score 56 to 59) and “severe impact” (total score 60 to 78). The 
continuous total score will be used in this analysis. The categorical HIT-6 scores will be 
summarized in a separate table.  
 
The total HIT-6 score from the 28-day period collected at Week 30 will be compared 
betwee
n treatment arms using a nonparametric rank analysis of covariance (rank 
ANCOVA) 
(Stokes et al, 2000), with treatment as a factor and adjusting for the baseline 
value. If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, then it will be considered statistically 
significant
 and testing will continue to the final secondary efficacy analysis. The BLOC F 
method will be used for missing values for this endpoint.

   18  
3. The proportion of patients with a ≥70% decrease from baseline in the frequency of 
headach
e days. 
The ≥70% responder rate will be analyzed using the same methods used to analyze the 
primary 
endpoint; a logistic regression model adjusted by the baseline frequency of 
headache da
ys. Exact conditional logistic regression analysis will be performed if there 
are conver
gence issues with the default unconditional analysis. The rules for data 
handling and missi
ng value imputation will be the same as used for the primary endpoint. 
 
All secondary a
nalyses will be repeated for the PP and ssITT Sets, if appropriate.

9. Safety Anal
yses  
 
All analyses of safety will be conducted using the Safety S et. All patients will be summarized 
according to the treatment they actually received, but the subgroup of topiramate patients who 
initially r
eceived topiramate and then switched to BOTOX will be summarized as follows: 
 All safety assessments occurring prior to the date of the first dose of BOTOX will be 
summarized for the topiramate treatment arm. 
 All safety assessments except A Es occurring  on or after the date of the first dose of 
BOTOX will be sum
marized separately for the topiramate + BOTOX subgroup. 
For all AEs,
 the total number of patients (N) in each treatment arm will represent the 
number of patients tha
t received that treatment. A patient may be counted in both 
treatment arms. The overall total will be the number of patients that received any 
treatment. The topiramate + BOTOX treatment arm will be a subset of the BOTOX 
treatment arm and
 will include patients that received both treatments. Denominators for 
percentages will be the total number of patients in each treatment arm or overall. 
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) include all AEs that start on or after the first dose of 
study medication up to t
he final visit, or are present prior to the first dose but increase in 
severity after the first dose of study medication up to the final visit. For patients who 
switch from topiramate to BOTOX, TEAEs starting on or after the date of the first 
BOTOX injection will be counted in the treatment arm that they are related to, as 
determined by
 a physician. If the TEAE is related to both treatments or if the relationship 
is unknown, it will be counted in both treatment arms but only once in the total. The 
topiramate + B
OTOX subset will summarize all TEAEs that occurred afte r a patient has 
switched from topiramate to BOTOX.  
 
Statistical hypothesis testing will not be performed on any safety results

   23 9.1. Adverse Events 
 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subjec
t administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign 
(includi
ng an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product. In addition, during the screening period, AEs will be assessed 
regardle
ss of the administration of a pharmaceutical product. 
 
Adverse events will be assessed, documented, and recorded in the eCRF and will be classified by 
SOC and PT according to MedDRA version 16.0 or higher throughout the study (ie, after 
informed consen
t has been obtained). All AEs collected from the time of informed consent that 
are prior to study treatment will be defined as pretreatment AEs and will be presented in the 
listings.  
 
A TEAE is defined as an AE that meets any of the following conditions: 
 Begins on or after the first dose of study drug and before the final scheduled office visit 
at 
Week 36; 
 Begins before the first dose of study drug and worsens in severity on or after the first 
dose of
 study drug and before the final scheduled office visit at Week 36; 
 Is completely missing an onset date and the end date is on or after the first dose of study 
drug 
 
If a
 patient receives BOTOX after receiving topiramate, the physician will be asked to determine 
if the AE is due to BOT
OX or topiramate or unknown.  
 
For the purpose of inclusion in TEAE tables, incomplete AE onset and end dates will be imputed 
as follows:
 
Missing onset dates (where “ UK” and “ UKN ” indicate unknown or missing day  and month 
respecti
vely): 
 UK-MMM-YYYY: If the month and year are different from the month and year of the 
fir
st dose of study drug, assume the onset date is 01 -MMM-YYYY. If the month and year 
are the s
ame as the first dose of study drug month and year, and the end date (after any 
imputation) is on or after the first dose of study drug, then assume the onset date is the 
date of the first dose of study drug. If the month and year are the same as the first dose of 
study drug month and year and the end date (after any imputation) is prior to the first 
dose of study drug, then assume the end date for the onset date.  
 DD-UKN -YYYY/UK-UKN-YYYY: If the year is different from the year of first dose of 
study
 drug, assume 01-JAN-YYYY of the collected year. If the year is the same as the 
first dose of study drug year, and the end date (after any imputation) is on or after the first 
dose of study drug, then assume the onset date is the date of the first dose of study drug. 
If the year is the same as the first dose of study drug, and the end date (after any 

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   24 imputation)  is prior to the first dose of study drug, then assume the end date for the onset 
date.  
 
Missing end dates (where “ UK” and “ UKN” indicate unknown or missing day  and month

9.1.1. Incidence of Adverse Events 
 
All AEs
 will be summarized for the Safety Set in the manner described in Section 9. Counts and 
perce
ntage of patients with each type of AE will be provided. Denominators for percentages will 
be the total number of patients treated in each arm or overall. At each level of patient 
summarization, a patient is counted once if the patient reported one or more events. 
 
An overview summary of the number and percentage of patients with any TEAE, serious TEAE, 
study drug-related TEAE, study drug-related serious TEAE, TEAE leading to treatment 
discontinuation, TEAE leading to study discontinuation, and AE leading to death will be 
provided by treatment arm.  
 
Treatme
nt-emergent AEs will also be summarized separately for each injection cycle for 
BOTOX treated patients. 
 
The following summary tables will be repeated for any TEAE, serious TEAE, study drug-related 
TEAE, study drug-related serious TEAE, TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation, TEAE 
leading to study termination, and AE leading to death. 
 
Summaries of the total number of TEAE s and the number and percentage of patients with at least 
one TEAE  will be provided by treatment group. The number and percentage of patients and the 
number of events will also be presented by SOC and PT in descending order from the SOC with 
the highest total incide
nce (that is, summed across all treatment groups) to the SOC with the 
lowest total incidence. If the total incidence for any 2 or more SOCs is equal, the SOCs will be 
presented in alph
abetical order. Within each SOC, the PTs will be presented in alphabetical 
order. At each level of patient summarization, a patient is counted once if the patient reported 
one or more e
vents. 
 
All AEs, will be presented in a by-patient listing. 
 
9.1.2. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
 
A summa
ry of TEAEs by relationship to study drug will be presented in a table by incidence of 
occurrence. The relationships will be collected as the possibility that study drug caused the event

GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   25 and will be reported as “Related” or “Not Related”. In the TEAE relationship table, if a patient 
reports multiple occurrences of the same AE, only the most closely related occurrence will be 
presented. Treatment-emergent AEs that are missing a relationship will be presented in the 
summary table as “Related”, but will be presented in the data listing with a missing relationship. 
Percentages will be calculated by the number of patients in the Safety Set. Denominators for 
percentages will be the total number of patients treated in each arm or overall. 
 
The TEAE data will be categorized and presented by SOC, PT, and relationship in a manner 
simila
r to that described in Section 9.1.1. 
 
9.1.3. Severity of Adverse Event 
 
A summa
ry of TEAEs by severity will be presented in a table. The severity that will be presented 
represents the most extreme severity captured on the eCRF page. In the TEAE severity table, if a 
patient reported multiple occurrences of the same TEAE, only the most severe will be presented. 
Treatment-emergent AEs that are missing severity will be presented in tables as “Severe” but 
will be presented in the data listing with a missing severity. Counts and percentage of patients 
within each category will be provided using the Safety Set. Denominators for percentages will be 
the total number of patients treated in each arm or overall. 
 
A clinical determination will be made of the intensity of an AE. The severity assessment for a 
clinical adverse event must be completed using the following definitions as guidelines: 
 Mild:   Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. 
 Moder
ate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. 
 S
evere:   Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity. 
 Not a
pplicable: In some cases, an adverse event may be an ‘all or nothing’ finding 
which c
annot be graded. 
 
The AE da
ta will be categorized and presented by SOC, PT, and severity in a manner similar to 
that described in Section 9.1.1 . 
 
9.1.4. Serious Adverse Events 
 
The ser
iousness of an AE should be assessed by the Investigator independently from the severity 
of the AE. A serious AE (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, 
results in death, is life-threatening, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, requires inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or results in a persistent or significant 
disability/inc
apacity. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.

   26  
The serious TEAE data will be categorized and presented by SOC and PT in a manner similar to 
that describe
d in Section 9.1.1 . 
 
A by -
patient listing of SAEs will be presented. 
 
9.1.5. Adver
se Events Leading to Treatment Discontinuation 
 
A summa
ry of TEAEs with a study drug action taken of either “Drug Withdrawn” or “Switched 
to BOTOX” will be presented in a table. At each level of patient summarization, a patient is 
counted once if the
 patient reported one or more events. Counts and percentage of patients within 
each category will be provided. Denominators for percentages will be the total number of 
patients treated in each arm or overall.  
 
Treatment-emergent AEs leading to treatment discontinuation will be categorized and presented 
by SOC and PT in a manner similar to that described in Section 9.1.1. 
 
9.1.6. Death 
 
All deaths occ
urring any time from the time of informed consent to study conclusion will be 
summarized by reason and presented in a table. A supportive listing will be generated to provide 
patient-specific details including the reason for death for all patients in the ITT Set.  
 
9.2. Serum Chemistry  
 
Blood samples will be collected for clinical laboratory testing at screening for all patients. Blood 
samples will additionally be collected for patients who discontinue topiramate and switch to 
BOTOX prior to their first administration of BOTOX. 
 
The following serum chemistry laboratory tests will be included: blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 
(mg/dL), calcium (mg/dL), creatinine (mg/dL), sodium (mEq/mL), potassium (mEq/mL), 
chloride (mEq/mL), carbon dioxide (mEq/mL), and alkaline phosphatase (U/L). All chemistry 
data will be presented in a by-patient listing. 
 
Laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory. All summaries will be based 
on the units provided by the central laboratory; no conversion will be done.  
 
 
9.3. Vital Sign Me
asurements 
 
Vital signs will be measured at screening, Day 1, and each subsequent office visit. 

ALLERGAN  Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 2.0  
GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   27 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate over 30 seconds should be taken after 
patients have been at rest (seated) for at least 2 minutes. Blood pressure should be recorded in 
mmHg. Pulse rate should be measured in beats per minutes. Oral, axillary, or tympanic body 
temperature should be taken. The same route should be used throughout the study. If oral 
temperature is taken, the patient should not have any oral intake for at least 5 minutes prior to the 
measurement. Temper
ature as Fahrenheit (°F) or Celsius (°C) should be specified on the source 
document and the eCRF. 
 
Summary tables will be presented for vital sign data by treatment group for patients in the Safety 
Set. Observed results at each visit will be presented. 
 
All vital sig
n data will be presented in a by-patient listing. 
 
9.4. Physical Examination 
 
At screening and study exit, the investigator will examine the patient for any detectable 
abnormalities of the following body systems: general appearance; neck (including thyroid); head, 
eyes, ears, nose, and throat; lungs; heart/cardiovascular; abdomen; neurologic; extremities; back; 
musculoskeletal; lymphatic; skin; and other. The neurologic examination should be conducted to 
detect the presence of any significant sensory/motor abnormalities.  
 
Height and we
ight should be measured at screening, Day 1, and each subsequent office visit 
using the same scale and ruler for all patients at a given investigator site when possible. 
 
A table will summar
ize physical examination results by treatment group and overall for the 
Safety Set. Each visit captures the status of a body system and any finding associated with the 
body system as normal, abnormal, or not done. The summary will include the number and 
percentage of patients with each physical examination outcome for the following body systems: 
skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (respiratory; cardiovascular; gastrointestinal; 
endocrine/metabolic; genitourinary; neurological; blood/lymphatic; musculoskeletal; and other. 
Pati
ents will be counted in the arm in which they were treated. Denominators for percentages 
will be the total number of patients treated in each arm. 
 
Physical examination results for all patients will be presented in a listing.  
 
9.5. Pregnancy Test 
 
Urine pregnancy testing will be conducted at screening, on day 1, and each subsequent office 
visit to confirm conti
nued non-pregnant status prior to study drug administration or study 
completion.   
 
A listing will be pre
sented for pregnancy test status.

GMA- US-NEU- 0206   Date Issued: 17JUL2017 
  
   28 9.6. Urine Drugs of Abuse  
 
Illicit drug urine testing will be conducted at screening and day 1, prior to study treatment 
administration, and will be performed at the investigator site. 
 
A listing will be presented for urine drugs of abuse at screening. 
9.7. Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
 
The C-SSRS will be conducted at the screening visit and each subsequent office visit. At 
screening, patients will be asked about the 12 months prior to the screening visit along with a 
separat
e assessment for lifetime prior to the screening visit. For visits after the screening visit, 
the assessment will be for the time period since the previous visit. The assessments will be 
summarized for each treatment group using the Safety Set.   
 
Among the questi
ons for each assessment time period (lifetime, prior 12 months, since previous 
visit) are a set of 10 questions intended to elicit a yes or no response from the patient (as deduced 
by the investigator site's interview of the patient) and a question (post-screening only) regarding 
completed suicide. Among those questions are 5 regarding suicidal ideation, arranged in order of 
increasing severity (1= wish to be dead, 2= non-specific suicidal thoughts, 3= method without 
intent to ac
t, 4= some intent but without plan and 5= intent and plan). Also included are 
6 questions in the suicidal behavior section of the C-SSRS (non-suicidal self-injurious behavior, 
prepa
ratory behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed 
suicide). 
 
C-SSRS data will be summarized separately for the following sets of responses: (1) year prior to 
screening, (2) baseline as reported under "since screening" at the randomization visit and (3) by 
visit reported as 
"since last visit." Overall ideation and behavior responses for the treatment 
period will be done by taking the most severe response (eg, a yes response at any time point for a 
specific ideation or behavior question).  
 
Counts and percentage of patients with each answer on the questionnaire will be provided. 
Summary statistics will include the count and percentage of patients for each of the 11 ideation 
and behavior categories separately and also overall for any ideation, for any behavior and for any 
ideation or behavior. Denominators for percentages will be the total number of patients treated in 
each arm. 
 
10. Interim Analysis  
 
There is no interim analysis planned for this study.

   29 11. Deviation from Protocol -Specified Analyses  
 
The subset of ITT and Per-protocol population analyses will not be performed since subjects who 
would discontinued due to reasons specified and subjects with major protocol deviations, 
respectively, is expected to be few; hence difference on number of subjects in each of the two 
populations and the ITT population is minimal.

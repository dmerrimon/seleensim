Page 4 SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Amendment Rationale:  
The main purpose of this amendment is  to update  the hierarchical order for  statistical  testing of 
the secondary endpoints  based on recent feedback from  the United States Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA ).   
This amendment is considered to be non-substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European 
Union  because it does not significantly impact the safety or physical/men tal integrity of subjects 
nor the scientific value of the study.

Study Design:  This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
global study to compare the effect of quizartinib versus  placebo 
(administered with standard induction and consolidation 
chemotherapy, then administered as continuation therapy for up 
to 36 cycles) on the primary endpoint of OS in subjects with 
newly diagnosed AML with FLT3 -ITD mutations . 
Randomization  will be stratified based on:  
 Region (North America, Europe, and Asia/Other Regions)  
 Age (<60 years old, ≥60 years old)  
 White blood cell (WBC) count at the time of diagnosis of 
AML (<40×109/L, ≥40×109/L) 
Study Phases:  
Induction Phase (up to 2 cycles)  
Cycle 1  
Cycle  1, Day 1 is defined as the start date o f the chemotherapy 
infusions.  
Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) 100  mg/m2/day 
(200 mg/m2/day allowed if institutional or local standard) will 
be administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for a 
total of 7 d ays, starting on Day 1 and ending on Day 8.  
One of the fol lowing anthracycline regimens (i nvestigator’s 
choice) will be administered:  
 Daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/day IV infusion on Days 1, 2, and 3; or  
 Idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day IV infusion on Days 1, 2, and 3.  
Subjects will be randomized on Day 7.   If necessary, 
Randomization  may be performed later (eg , Days 8 to 10) to 
allow time for addressing electrolyte abnormalities, QTcF 
prolongation, etc.  
Quizartinib/placebo will be administered orally once daily for 14 
days.  Dosing should start after the end of the cytarabine 
infusion, normally on Day 8.  If quizartinib/placebo 
administration cannot begin as scheduled, the start of dosing 
may be delayed, but best efforts should be made to start within 3 
days of Randomizati on if possible.  If quizartinib/placebo cannot

Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 8 be started within 3 days of Randomization , please contact the 
Medical Monitor.  The dose will be 40 mg/day.  For subjects 
concomitantly receiving a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 
inhibitor, the dose will be reduced from 40 mg/day to 20 
mg/day.  If quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, missed doses will 
not be made up.  
On Day 21 (window Day 21 to Day 28), a bone marrow aspirate 
specimen (or a core biopsy specimen if aspirate cannot be 
obtained) will be collected for local and central pathology.  If 
this bone marrow does not provide an accurate assessment of 
response, the bone marrow aspiration will be repeated upon 
count recovery or Day 56 ( 3 days), whichever occurs first.   
Subjec ts with ≥ 5% b lasts after Cycle  1 may receive a second 
cycle of Induction, if appropriate.  
Cycle 2  
For Cycle 2 of Induction, i nvestigators may choose to administer 
1 of the following:  
 “7+3” chemotherapy regimen, defined as 7 days of continuous 
IV infusion of cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day (200 mg/m2/day 
allowed if institutional or local standard) plus 3 days of 
anthracycline (the same anthracycline must be used throughout 
the Induction phase); OR  
 “5+2” chemotherapy regimen, defined as 5 days of continuous 
IV infusion of cytarabine 100  mg/m2/day (200 mg/m2/day 
allowed if institutional or local standard) plus 2 days of 
anthracycline (the same anthracycline must be used throughout 
the Induction phase).  
Quizartinib/placebo will be administered orally once daily for 14 
days.  Dosing will start following the end of the cytarabine 
infusion, normally on Cycle 2, Day 8 or Cycle 2, Day 6, 
depending on the chemot herapy regimen selected by the 
investigator (ie, “7+3” or “5+2”, respectively).   If 
quizartinib/placebo administration cann ot begin as scheduled, 
the start of dosing may be delayed, but best efforts should be 
made to begin as soon as possible.  If quizartinib/placebo is 
interrupted, missed doses will not be made up.  
Collection of a bone marrow aspirate specimen (or a core biopsy 
specimen if aspirate cannot be obtained) and assessment of 
response will be done according to the same schedule as in 
Cycle 1.

Page 9 Consolidation Phase  
Subjects who achieve a CR or CRi at the end of the Induction 
Phase will enter the Consolidation Phas e.  The following are the 
options for consolidation therapy:  
 treatment with quizart inib/placebo plus cytarabine (4  cycles, 
if tolerated); or  
 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); 
or 
 treatment with quizartinib/placebo plus cytarabine, f ollowed 
by allogeneic HSCT.  
Cytarabine will be given on Da ys 1, 3, and 5 for a total of 
6 doses.  The cytarabine regimen will be:  
 for subjects <60 years old: cytarabine 3.0 g/m2 IV infusion, 
every 12 hours; or  
 for subjects ≥60 years old: cytarabine 1.5 g /m2 IV infusion, 
every 12 hours.  
Quizartinib/placebo will be administered orally once daily for 14 
days, starting on Day 6.  If quizartinib/placebo administration 
cannot begin as scheduled, the start of dosing may be delayed, 
but best efforts should be mad e to begin as soon as possible.  
The dose will be 40 mg/day.  For subjects concomitantly 
receiving a strong cytochrome CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose will 
be reduced from 40 mg/day to 20  mg/day.  If quizartinib/placebo 
is interrupted, missed doses will not be made up.  
A bone marrow aspirate specimen (or a core biopsy specimen if 
aspirate cannot be obtained) will be collected for local and 
central pathology in the first and last cycles of Consolidation, 
upon count recovery from Day 21 to Day 56.  
Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
Subjects are permitted to undergo allogeneic HSCT between the 
end of the Induction Phase and the s tart of the Continuation  
Phase.   Under certain circumstances, subjects meeting necessary 
criteria may unde rgo allogeneic HSCT for consolidation within 
the first 3 months of the Continuation Phase  (see 
Section  6.2.2.2 ). 
For subjects who undergo allogeneic  HSCT, treatment with 
quizartinib/placebo should be discontinued 7 days before the 
start of a conditioning regimen.  Subjects may begin 
continuation  therapy 30 to 180 days after the allogeneic HSCT.  
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 10 Sites should follow their local procedures for allogenei c HSCT 
conditioning and recovery.  
From the time of allogeneic HSCT up through the end of t he 
allogeneic HSCT period, the i nvestigator will contact the 
transplant unit every 4 weeks for follow -up information.  Once 
the subject is able, the subject will ret urn to the clinic for site 
visits every 4 weeks.  
Continuation  Phase (up to 36 cycles ):  
Following consolidation therapy, subjects will enter the 
Continuation  Phase if they meet the inclusion criteria.   In 
addition, per i nvestigator discretion, subjects who  have achieved 
CR or CRi following Induc tion but are unable to receive 
consolidation therapy will be permitted to enter the Continuation  
Phase if they meet the inclusion criteria.  
During the Continuation  Phase subjects will be treated with 
quizartinib/plac ebo once daily for up to 36 cycles .  Continuation  
therapy  will begin after induction or c onsolidation therapy, 
including allogeneic HSCT, and will continue until relapse, start 
of nonprotocol specified AML treatment, death, unacceptable 
toxicity, study clo se, or completion of 36 cycles , whichever 
occurs first.  
Quizartinib/placebo will be administered orally once daily 
starting on Day 1, with no breaks in dosing between cycles.  If 
quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, missed doses will not be made 
up. 
The starting dose will be 30 mg.  For subjects receiving a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor concomitantly, the starting dose will be 20 
mg/day.  
On Cycle 1, Day 16, the dose will be increased from 30 mg/day 
to 60 mg/day (from 20 mg/day to 30 mg/day for subjects 
receiving a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) if the average QTcF of the 
triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) is ≤450 ms on Cycle  1, 
Day 15.  If the  dose of quizartinib/placebo is not able to be 
increased on Cycle 1, Day 16, the dose may be increased on 
Cycle 2, Day 2 if the average QTcF of the triplicate ECGs is 
≤450 ms on Cycle 2, Day 1.  Once the dose is increased t o 
60 mg/day, the subject may cont inue on this dose as long as 
dose reduction is not needed.  
Subjects will have their blood counts monitored every 4 weeks 
and will have a bone marrow exam every 12 weeks for 48 weeks 
and then every 24 weeks until week 96 .

Page 11 Long -Term Follow -up Phase  
The Long -Term Follow -up Phase begins upon completion of 36 
cycles  of quizartinib/placebo in the Continuation  Phase or 
permanent discontinuation of quizartinib/placebo in any phase.  
After completion of the 30 day safety visit, long -term follow -up 
visits will be per formed as follows:  
 Every 4 weeks for subjects who have not had an EFS event;  
 Every 12 weeks for subjects who have had an EFS event.  
Study Duration:  The total duration of subject participation will be until death, 
withdrawal of consent, the subject becomes  lost to follow -up, or 
study closure, whichever occurs first.  Subjects will be followed 
for EFS and OS events aft er completion of induction and 
consolidation therapy whether or not the subject  receives 
continuation  therapy.  
The total duration of treatment with quizartinib/placebo will be 
up to 42 cycles (inclusive of Induction, Consolidation , and 
Continuation  Phases).  
The OS analysis will be performed : 
 When the target 287 OS events are observed and a minimum 
of 24 months has elapsed since the last subject was 
randomized . 
 If the target 287 OS events are not achieved by 24 months 
since the last subject was randomized, then the analysis will 
be performed at a maximum of 30 months after the last 
subject is randomized.  
All other efficacy analyses will be performed at the same time as 
the OS analysis . 
The primary completion date is the date when the final OS 
analysis (up to a maximum of 30 months after the last subject is 
randomized) has been completed.  All subjects stil l on treatment 
and continuing to derive benefit from study drug at the primary 
completion date will continue to follow the study schedule of 
assessments until the overall End of Study is reached.  
Overall End of Study will occur when:  
 all subjects have disc ontinued treatment and discontinued 
long-term survival follow -up or have died  
 an alternative study becomes available, for subjects 
continuing to derive benefit from treatment with quizartinib, 
where the study drug is offered to these subjects

Planned Sample Size:  The target sample size will be approximately 536 subjects, 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive quizartinib/placebo: 
administered with standard induction and consolidation 
chemotherapy, then administered as continuation therapy for up 
to 36 cycles.  
Statistical Analyses:  Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Intent -to-treat ( ITT) 
Analysis Set and Per -protocol Analysis Set.  All other efficacy 
exploratory analyses will be performed based on ITT Analysis 
Set and availability of assessm ent. 
The efficacy analyses will be performed according to the 
treatment groups assigned at Randomization.  
Overall survival is  the primary efficacy endpoint for this study.  
Comparison of distribution of OS between treatment groups will 
be made using a strat ified log -rank test with the 3  stratification 
factors used in randomization at a 2-sided 5% significance level.  
The median OS will  be calculated based on Kaplan -Meier 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 18 estimates and the corresponding 95%  confidence interval (CI) 
will be calculated using th e method provided by Brookmeyer 
and Crowley.  
The OS analysis will be performed:  
 When the target 287 OS events are observed and a minimum 
of 24 months has elapsed since the last subject was 
randomized.  
 If the target 287 OS events are not achieved by 24 months 
since the last subject was randomized, then the analysis will 
be performed at a maximum of 30 months after the last 
subject is randomized.  
For t he secondary analys es, compar ison of distribution of EFS  
between the 2  treatment groups will be made using a stratified 
log-rank test with the 3  stratification factors used in 
randomization.  The distribution function of EFS will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  EFS will be 
analyzed based on the response assessment by the Independent 
Review Co mmittee (IRC) .  EFS will also be analyzed based on 
the investigator’s response assessment as one of the  sensitivity 
analys es to be performed . 
Comparisons of CR rate, rate of subjects achieving CR with 
FLT3 -ITD MRD negativity, CR c rate, and rate of subjects  
achieving CR c with FLT3 -ITD MRD negativity between 
treatment groups will be made using a Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test with the 3 stratification factors used in 
randomization . 
To control for the family -wise type I error rate for the primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints, a serial hierarchically ordered 
gatekeeping strategy will be employed.  The primary assessment 
of OS in the ITT Analysis Set will be evaluated first, and if 
significant at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, a statistical eva luation of 
EFS by IRC , based on the EFS definition in the Guidance s,63,72 
will be performed  in the ITT Analysis Set .  After EFS 
evaluation, the order of other secondary endpoints to be tested 
will be CR rate, rate of subjects achieving CR with FLT3 -ITD 
MRD negativity , CRc rate, and rate of subjects ac hieving CR c 
with FLT3 -ITD MRD negativity.  Testing will stop once 1 test 
in the sequence fails to be statistically significant.  
Exploratory efficacy analyses of RFS will be analyzed using the 
Kaplan -Meier method  for subjects achieving CRc.

cycle, rate of CRc at end of first Induction cycle, rate of CRh 
after Indu ction, and rate of MLFS  after Induction  will be 
analyzed and CI will be provided.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
For the PK -ECG -Biomarker Substudy: PK parameters of 
quizartinib and its metabolite (AC886) will be estimated for 
subjects who have sufficient plasma concentrations available.

Page 37 were relapsed or refractory to salvage therapy or relapsed after HSCT.  In Cohort 1, the 
composite complete remission (C Rc) rate was 57% in FLT3 -ITD (+) subjects with a median 
survival of 25.3 weeks.2,4  Cohort 2 showed a CRc rate of 46% in FLT3 -ITD (+) subjects with a 
median survival of 24.0 weeks.2 Importa ntly, 35% of Cohort 2 FLT3 -ITD (+) subjects were 
bridged to HSCT.5  
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in the Phase 1 study, CP0001, was 200 mg 
continuous daily dosing.3  However, in the Phase 2 Study (AC220 -002) 35% of subjects 
experienced Grade 3 QT prolongation at the 200 mg dose a nd therefore the dose was reduced.  A 
single case of Grade 4 QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, was reported in the AC220 -002 
Study in a subject with pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, taking concomitant medications known to 
cause QT prolongation.6  No deaths related to QT prolongation have been reported.2 
A Phase 2b Study (2689 -CL-2004) was subsequently conducted, which enrolled 76 subjects with 
FLT3 -ITD (+) AML randomized to 60 mg or 30 mg daily, to examine efficacy and toxicity at 
these lower doses.  Both males and females were randomized at ea ch dose.   The study showed 
that the CRc rate was similar at both lower doses and to that observed in the earlier Study 
AC220 -002 ( Table  1.1).7  QT prolongation was dose -dependent and was substantially reduced at 
the lower do ses (Table  1.2).

Common adverse events (AEs) observed in the Phase 1 and 2 studies included gastrointestinal 
disorders (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), hematologic disorders (anemia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia), febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and QT prolongation.  Although hematologic 
toxicity is associated with underlying disease, safety reports from Study AC220 -002 in AML 
indicate delayed recovery or continued suppression of absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) and 
platelets as a consequence of continued treatment with quizartinib.2 
1.1.1.5.1.  Clinical Pharmacology  
The tablet formulation, which will be used in Phase 3 studies, exhibited comparable relative 
bioavailability to the solution formulation which was administered in the earlier Phase 1 and 2 
studies.  In a relative bioavailability study (AC220 -014) in fastin g, healthy volunteers and oral 
administration of a single 60 mg dose (2x30 mg tablets) of quizartinib, the median time to 
maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) was 4 (minimum, 2; maximum; 8) hours for quizartinib 
and 8 (minimum, 4; maximum; 48) hours for AC8 86 (the major active metabolite of quizartinib, 
with similar potency to the parent molecule, quizartinib ).  The geometric mean (coefficient of 
variation [CV] %) terminal half -life was 64.9 (75%) hours and 53.5 (40%) hours for quizartinib 
and AC886, respect ively.  Quizartinib and AC886 showed dose -proportional increases in area 
under the concentration versus  time curve (ng•h/mL) (AUC) and maximum plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) over the tested dose range of 30 to 90 mg.2 
Following a single -oral dose of [14C]-quizartinib, 76.3% of total radioactivity was recovered in 
feces with only 1.6% recovered in urine 14 days after dosing (AC220 -006).  Excretion of 
radioactivity was still ongoing at study completion at Day 14, mainly in feces.  AC886 was the 
only major circulating metabolite and is formed by cytochrome P450 ( CYP3A4).2 
In a Phase 2b study, 2689 -CL-2004, in which AML subjects receiving multiple doses of 
quizartinib at 30  mg/day or 60 mg/day, steady -state was reached by Day 15 for both quizartinib 
and AC886, consistent with the terminal half -life of approximately 3 days observed in healthy

Page 40 1.1.1.5.2.  Combination Studies with Induction Chemotherapy  
Study 2689 -CL-0005 is a Phase 1, open -label, multiple -dose, dose -escalation study i n patients 
with newly diagnosed AML [FLT3 -ITD (+) or FLT3 -ITD ( -)].  Th e treatment and follow up 
phases of the study has been completed.  
The dose escalation was conducted using a modified 3+3 design, where 6 subjects were enrolled 
at each dose level.  The subjects were given cytarabine 200 mg/m2 × 7 days and daunorubicin 
60 mg/m2 × 3 days (7+3) for Induction and high dose intermittent cytarabine 3 g/m2 every 
12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 for Consolidation.  Quizartinib was administered daily for either 
7 or 14 days, starting at Day 4 of induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy.  Subjects were 
allowed to proceed directly to a stem cell transplant after achieving a response or receive further 
quizartinib as maintenance  therapy after Consolidation if they wer e not transplant eligible.  Three 
dose levels were tested; 60 mg × 7 days, 60 mg × 14 days, and 40 mg × 14 days.  Through 
May 31, 2013 18 subjects were enrolled in the study.  The median age of subjects was 43 years 
(minimum, 22; maximum, 60).  Of the 18 s ubjects, 16 had the FLT-ITD mutation.  At 60 mg × 
7 days, one of the 6 subjects had a dose limiting toxicity (DLT , grade 3 hyponatremia).  At 
60 mg × 14 days, 2 of the 6 subjects had a DLT (Grade  3 QT corrected [QTc] prolongation and 
Grade 4 pericarditis) which exceeded the pre -specified criteria so 40 mg × 14 days was then 
explored.  At 40  mg × 14 days, 1 of the 6 subjects had a DLT (Grade 3 constrictive pericarditis).  
The most common (20%) treatment -related AEs were nausea (42%), diarrhea (32%), anemia 
(26%), febrile neutropenia (26%), neutropenia (21%), fatigue (21%), pyrexia (21%) and 
thrombocytopenia (21%).  The most common (10%) Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related AEs were 
febrile neutropenia (26%), thrombocytopenia (21%) anemia (21%), neutropenia (21%), 
leucopenia (16%), and nausea (11%).  The maximum tolerated dose was identified as 40 mg for 
14 days or 60 mg for 7 days.2,9 
The AML18 pilot quizartinib dose -escalation  study was an i nvestigator -sponsored s tudy 
conducted in the UK that enrolled newly diagnosed (FLT3 [+] and FLT3 [ -]) AML patients 
greater than 60 years old.1  Quizartinib was administered  with standard chemotherapy comprised 
daunorubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide.10 
Six cohorts with escalating doses of quizartinib (60 mg, 90 mg or 1 35 mg based on doses used in 
the Phase 2 AC220 -002 study with quizartinib) for 7 or 14 days were planned.  If 60 mg was not 
tolerated dose de -escalation to 40mg for 7 or 14 days was allowed.  Because of the presumed 
increased sensitivity in females to QTc prolongation, each cohort required a minimum of 
3 females.   The day of safety evaluation was on completion of the che motherapy in course 2.  
Fifty -five subjects with a median age of 69 years (minimum, 62; maximum, 87) were enrolled, of 
whom 48 were evaluable.  Four subjects were FLT3 -ITD (+).  Thirteen subjects (4 males, 
9 females) entered Cohort 1 (60  mg for 7  days).  No DLTs were seen in male s but 3 DLTs 
occurred in females (all grade 4:1 cardiac (myocardial infarction), 1 hypokalemia; 1 mucositis) 
so this cohort exceeded tolerability for females. 8 subjects (all males) entered Cohort 2 (60 mg 
for 14 days) where 4 DLTs (all grade 3; 3 QTc prol ongation, 1 appetite loss) were seen, so this 
cohort exceeded tolerability for males.10  In the 40 mg for 14 day cohort, there was 1 DLT 
(hematologic al) of 5 evaluable males and 0 of 8 evaluable females had a DLT.  
Induction death (death within 30 days) occurred in 3/46 (6.5%) evaluable patients.  Complete 
remission (CR) was achieved in 33/42 (79%; including all 4 FLT3 -ITD [+]) of subjects evaluable

Page 41 for CR.  Overall median time to neutrophil and platelet coun t recovery (neutrophils to 
1000 /mm3; platelets to 100 ,000/mm3) was prompt (28 and 22 days post Course  1; 22 and 19 days 
post Course 2, respectively).  No subjects received stem cell transplantation.  
Based on data from these 2 clinical studies, quizartinib is predicted to be tolerated and provide 
sufficient clinical benefit administered in subjects as 40 mg dose once daily for 14 days.

diagnosed FLT3 -ITD AML subjects in first remission.10, 11, 12  An ongoing Phase 1 study of 
quizartinib as maintenance  therapy in subjects with AML who have been treated with an 
allogeneic HSCT ( 2689 -CL-0011 ) has enrolled 13 subjects with AML in morphologic remission 
(<5% bone marrow blasts) during first or second remission following an allogeneic HSCT.1  
These subjects were identified as FLT3 -ITD (+) at diagnosis, and after recovery of blood counts 
post-HSCT were treated with doses of 40 mg/day (n=7) and 60 mg/day ( n=6) of quizartinib.13 
Preliminary data has shown that both doses are well tolerated and the median number of cycles 
administered was 18.12  One patient relapsed on study drug (Cycle 1).  One patient had Grade 2 
graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) on quizartinib.  There was no Grade 3 QTcF prolongat ion.  
Preliminary results showed that all 13 subjects had experienced at least 1 treatment -emergent AE 
(TEAE); diarrhea (62%), fatigue (54%), nausea (54%), vomiting (54%), GVHD in skin (38%), 
neutropenia (38%), anemia (31%), dry eye (31%), dysgeusia (31%),  peripheral edema (31%), 
pyrexia (31%), and upper respiratory tract infection (31%) were reported in more than 3 subjects 
each.  Three subjects discontinued treatment due to AEs: Grade 4 possibly -related neutropenia; 
Grade 3 not related hemolytic anemia; and Grade 2 possibly related corneal epithelium defect.2,13  
Per study protocol, further dose escalation to 90 mg/day was allowed but based on data from the 
2689 -CL-2004 study examining 30 mg and 60 mg/day doses and showing a high level of clinical 
activity with reduced QT prolongation compared t o higher doses, it was decided that no further 
dose escalation was desirable.8  These data indicate that quizartinib can be safely administered as 
maintenance  therapy after HSCT with promising early efficacy data.  
1.2. Study Rationale  
FLT3 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Class III split -kinase domain family 
of RTKs.  FLT3 is expressed in AML cells in approximately 90% of patients and  stimulates 
survival and proliferation of leukemic blasts.14, 15  Moreover, FLT3 is mutated in 30% of AML 
cases.16, 17  The 2 types of mutations found in AML include ITDs (24%) and point mutations in 
the activation loop (approximately 7%).2, 16  Patients with FLT3 -ITD mutations have a worse 
prognosis when treated with conventional chemotherapy compared with patients with wild -type 
FLT3 due to a higher relapse rate.18  No FLT3 inhibitors have been approved for AML due to 
limited clinical utility with lack of durable responses when administered as single agents.19, 20  
Initial studies with the next generation quizartin ib are encouraging based on a high response rate 
when administered as monotherapy.  However acute myeloid leukemia is a polyclonal disease 
and patients with FLT3 -ITD mutated AML may experience greater clinical benefit when 
quizartinib is administered in co mbination with standard chemotherapy.17  In addition to FLT3, 
quizartinib inhibits c -KIT stem cell factor CD117 which is expressed in more than 70% o f AML.  
Furthermore, KIT mutations occur in more than 40% of core binding factor leukemias.21  In 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 42 addition, KIT mutations are evident in Runt -related transcription factor 1/  runt-related 
transcription factor 1; translocated to, 1 -(+) AML.22, 23 
Results from the Phase 1 2689 -CL-0005 and AML18 studies of quizartinib in combination with 
standard induction and/or consolidation therapy for su bjects with newly diagnosed FLT3 -ITD 
(+) AML showed that quizartinib at the doses of 40 mg for 14 days can be safely administered 
with induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy .  In addition, the majority of FLT3 -ITD (+) 
subjects achieved CR.  The data f rom Study 2689 -CL-0011 indicate that quizartinib can be 
safely administered as maintenance  after HSCT with promising early efficacy data with only 1 of 
13 FLT3 -ITD (+) patients experiencing disease relapse.13  These findings serve as the basis for 
studying combination of quizartinib with chemotherapy and subsequent continuation  treatment 
following consolidation chemotherapy  or HSCT in subjects with ne wly diagnosed AML with 
FLT3 -ITD mutations . 
1.2.1.  Selection of ≥3% FLT3 -ITD Allelic Ratio as Cutoff for Study Eligibility  
In previous Phase 2 studies with quizartinib, subjects with an allelic ratio of FLT3 -ITD to total 
FLT3 of >10% were defined as ITD(+).  Analysis of “ITD( -)” subjects from Study AC220 -002 
showed that those subjects with a low level (≤10%) of the ITD mutation had similar response 
rates to positive (>10%) subjects, while those with no detectable ITD mutation (<0.3%) had 
lower response rates.  Therefore, for the ongoing QuANTUM -R Phase 3 study of relapsed and 
refractory AML subjects and for this QuANTUM -First study the cutoff will be reduced to ≥3% 
based on the limit of quantitation for the clinical diagnostic assay.  The lower ITD ratio for 
eligibility will allow those subjects with a reliably detectable and quantifiable ITD mutation to be 
enrolled and to determine the potential benefit from quizartinib.  
1.2.2.  Selection of Chemotherapy Regimens  
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guideli nes ( Version 1.2015) for 
induction chemotherapy  for AML include a 3 -day administration of an anthracycline (idarubicin 
12 mg/m2 or daunorubicin 45 mg /m2 to 90 mg /m2) plus 7 days of standard dose cytarabine 
(cytosine arabinoside) (“7+3” chemotherapy regim en).24, 25, 26  
Anthracycline (idarubicin 12 mg/m2 or daunorubicin 45 mg /m2 to 90 mg /m2) is administered as 
a short intravenous (IV) infusion or bolus daily for 3 days (Days 1 to 3).  The dose of cytarabine 
is usually 100 mg/m2 to 200 mg/m2, administered as a continuous IV infusion daily for 7 days 
(Days 1 to 7).24 
Depending on ag e and patient selection about 70 to 80 percent of patients achieve a CR with 
idarubicin or daunorubicin based induction therapy.27, 28  Most remissions come after a single 
course.  Until recently, daunorubicin had been commonly administered at a dose of 45 mg/m2; 
however, randomized studies sugg est that higher doses of daunorubicin (eg, 60 mg/m2 to 
90 mg/m2 per day) are more effective and no more toxic than 45 mg/m2.  A Phase 3 trial of 
657 adults (17 to 60 years old) with u ntreated AML randomly assigned i nduction therapy with 
7 days of continuous IV infusion cytarabine (100 mg/m2 per day) plus 3 once -daily doses of 
daunorubicin at 45 mg/m2 or 90  mg/m2.  Compared to the 45 mg/m2 daunorubicin dose, patients 
assigned to the 90  mg/m2 dose had a higher CR rate (71% versus  57 %), a longer medi an overall 
survival (OS), 24 versus  16 months) and similar rates of severe (grade 3/4/5) AEs.28  A similar 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 43 randomized trial in older adults (>60 year s) also reported higher CR rates with 90 mg/m2 
daunorubicin compared with 45mg/m2 (52% versus  35%).29 
However, in another trial (AML17), 1206 adults with untreated AML or high -risk 
myelodysplastic syndrome were randomly assigned induction therapy with cytarabine 
(100 mg/m2 every 12 hours on Days 1 to 10 inclusive) plus daunorubicin at a dose of either 
90 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 on Days 1, 3, and 5.25 All patients received a second Induction course 
that included daunorubicin 50 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, and 5.  There was no overall difference in CR 
rate.  The 60 day mortality was increased in th e 90 mg/m2 arm (10% versus  5%), which resulted 
in no difference in overall 2 year survival (59% versus  60%).25 
The proposed Induction regimen for Qu ANTUM -First is the standard “7+3” regimen with the 
choice of daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 or idarubicin 12 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 3 combined with 
cytarabine 100 mg/m2 (200 mg/m2 if institutional or local standard) on Days 1 to 7.  
The NCCN Guidelines ( Version 1.2015)  for post -remission chemotherapy for AML include 
consolidation with high -dose cytarabine.  The NCCN recommended high dose cytarabine is 2 to 
3 g/m2 (1 to 1.5  g/m2 for subjects ≥60 years of age) administered as an IV infusion every 
12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 for a total of 6 doses.24  European Leukemia Net recommendations 
suggest using high dose cytarabine as a consolidation therapy in clinical tria ls only.30  
However, there is no clear consensus recommendation for a Consolidation cytarabine regimen 
for FLT3 (+) patients.  The NCCN recommends e nrolling FLT3 (+) patients into a clinical trial.24 
European LeukemiaNet recommendations suggest to use HSCT as a consolidation for patients 
with FLT 3-ITD who are 18 -60 years old and to use “modest” dose of cytarabine for 
consolidation in patients over age of 60.30  
The proposed consolidation regimen for QuANTUM -First is cytarabine 3 g/m2 twice daily for 
subjects <60 years old and 1.5 g/m2 twice daily for subjects ≥60 years old and on Days 1, 3, and 
5.  The dose of cytarabine has been defined as 3 g/m2 based on data from the CALGB study in 
whic h cytarabine doses of 100 mg/m2 or 400 mg/m2 for 5 days or 3 g/m2 twice daily on Days 1, 
3, and 5 were compared.31  The 3 g/m2 dose was found to hav e superior disease free survival 
compared to the lower doses.31  
1.2.3.  Rationale for Quizartinib Dose Selection  
During the Induction Phase and Consolidatio n Phase subjects will receive quizartinib 40 mg or 
matching placebo, once daily for 14 days per cycle, immediately following standard 
chemotherapy.  The 40 mg dose was selected based on the results of Study 2689 -CL-0005 and 
the investigator initiated AML18  pilot study.  In these studies quizartinib 40 mg × 14 days was 
identified as the MTD, when given in addition to standard chemotherapy in newly diagnosed 
AML subjects older than 60 years.  
In addition to the clinical data, the quizartinib dose of 40 mg foll owing chemotherapy is 
supported by data from pharmacodynamic assays.  The in vitro PIA measures the ability of 
plasma taken at various times before and after dosing with quizartinib to inhibit signaling in 
FLT3 -ITD (+) cell lines.  The inhibitory activity demonstrated in this assay has been found to 
correlate with clinical response to different FLT3 inhibitors.19  Plasma inhibitory activity data 
from the Phase 2b (2689 -CL-2004) studies demonstrated that 30 mg is the minimum dose for 
complete and rapid inhibition of FLT3 -ITD signaling in this assay.32  However, there are several 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 44 compensatory mechanisms, such as increases in FLT ligand and direct cell to cell contact 
between blast cells and stromal cells that reduce the effectiveness of FLT3 inhibitors and protect 
leukemic blasts from apoptosis.33, 34  Therefore it is important to adminis ter a dose above the 
minimum to ensure complete and durable inhibition of the target, particularly when quizartinib is 
administered for only 14 days and not continuously as with monotherapy studies.  
Data from Study AC220 -015, which examined the effect of s trong and moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors on quizartinib PK in human volunteers, indicate that concomitant ketoconazole, a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, will increase AUC 0-inf approximately 2 -fold, and concomitant 
fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, will incre ase quizartinib AUC 0-inf approximately 
1.2-fold.2  Additionally, predicted quizartinib Cmax at steady state after repeat daily dosing will 
increase approximately 2.0 -fold and 1.2 -fold, respectively, with concomitant ketoconazole and 
fluconaz ole.  Subjects who begin treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor while receiving 
quizartinib will be required to be reduced from 40 mg/day to 20 mg/day.   If the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of quizartinib can be resumed at the regular ly scheduled dose.  
No dose reduction of quizartinib is required when subjects are coadministered a moderate or 
weak CYP3A4 inhibitor.  If quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, missed doses will not be made up.  
Quizartinib  has been shown to be a P -glycoprote in (P -gp) substrate based on in vitro studies.  
However, clinical data suggest that P -gp plays a minimal role in the absorption or clearance of 
quizartinib.  Based on the mass balance study, quizartinib appears to be highly absorbed into 
enterocytes and ha s minimal renal excretion ( AC220 -006).  Inhibition of P -gp/CYP3A4 by 
ketoconazole resulted in a small change (eg , <20%) in absorption of quizartinib ( AC220 -015).  
Therefore no dose adjustment is required when quizartinib is coadministered with a P -gp 
inhib itor. 
The potential of quizartinib  and AC886 to inhibit cytarabine metabolism was examined in human 
liver S9.   Pooled human liver S9 was incubated with cytarabine (50 μM) in the presence of 
6 concentrations of quizartinib or AC886 (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μM) for 15 minutes at 
37°C.   At the end of the incubation period the reactions were terminated and samples were 
analyzed for ara -U, a metabolite of cytarabine.   Gemcitabine was used as a po sitive control 
inhibitor of cytarabine metabolism by cytidine deaminase.   Based on these data, quizartinib does 
not inhibit cytarabine metabolism (up to 30 μM for parent and metabolite).  
The quizartinib concentration relationship to QTcF prolongation (ΔQTc F) was evaluated by 
incorporating circadian rhythm with PK and ECG data collected from Study 2689 -CL-2004 into 
a non -linear mixed effect model.  The covariates evaluated were quizartinib and AC886 plasma 
concentrations and sex.  QTcF changes with circadian  rhythm and is linearly dependent on 
quizartinib plasma concentrations.  AC886 plasma concentrations and sex are not significant 
covariates for the QTcF prolongation.  This model was used to predict QTcF prolongation at 
steady state geometric mean Cmax nor malized to 40 mg.   The analysis predicted that 
administration of 40 mg/day quizartinib with dose reduction to 20 mg/day for the subjects on 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors resulted in the upper 90% CI of ΔQTcF less than 17 ms.  These results 
suggest that the prop osed quizartinib dose regimen has acceptable risk of QT prolongation based 
on the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E14 Guidance stating: “Drugs that prolong the mean  
QT/QTc interval by >20 ms have a substantially increased likelihood of being proarrhythmic.”35

Page 45 During the Continuation  Phase, subjects will receive study drug, quizartinib 30 mg or matching 
placebo, once daily, starting on Day 1, with no breaks between cycles.   Study drug dosage will 
be increased on Day 16 to 60 mg once daily for subjects where QTcF is maintained ≤450 ms and 
study drug is tolerated.  This escalating dose schedule based on QTcF interval at drug 
steady -state is the same as that in the ongoing QuANTUM -R Study.  The 30 mg and 60 mg 
doses were chosen, based on the results of Study 2689 -CL-2004.   In that study quizartinib 30 mg 
or 60 mg, was given to subjects with FLT3 -ITD (+) AML, and 60 mg was identified as the target 
dose as it showed rapid and durable inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation on pharmacodynamic 
assay.  Additional dose adjustments for  toxicity including myelosuppression and administration 
of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors from 30 mg/day to 20 mg/day, or 60 mg/day to 30 mg/day, are 
included.  If quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, missed doses will not be made up.  Once the dose 
is increased to 60 mg/day, the subject may continue on this dose as long as dose reduction is not 
needed .

3.1. Over all Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, global study to compare th e 
effect of quizartinib versus  placebo (administered with standard induction and consolidation 
chemotherapy, then administered as continuation therapy for up to 36 cycles) on the primary 
endpoint of OS in subjects with newly diagnosed AML with FLT3 -ITD mut ations .  The study 
duration is described in Section  3.1.1 . 
This study will be conducted in approximately 250 study sites worldwide.  
The target sample size will be approximately 536 subjects.  Randomization  will be done in a 
1:1 ratio into the 2 treatment groups (quizartinib or placebo).  Randomization  will be stratified 
based on:  
 Region (North America, Europe, Asia/ Other Regions ) 
 Age (<60 years old, ≥60 years old)  
 White blood cell (WBC) count at the time of diagnosis of AML (<40×109/L, 
≥40×109/L) 
The study design consists of 4 consecutive phases (Induction, Consolidation, Continuation , 
Long -Term Follow -up) as outlined in Section 3.2.2  and shown in  Figure  3.1.  Figure  3.2 shows

3.1.1.  Study Duration  
The total duration of subject participation will be until death, withdrawal of consent, lo st to 
follow -up, or study closure, whichever occurs first.  Subjects will be followed for EFS  and OS  
events after completion of induction and consolidation therapy, whether or not the subject 
receives continuation  therapy.  Close and uniform follow up is essential to determine the timing 
of relapse in each treatment arm.  
The total duration of treatment with quizartinib/placebo will be up to 42 cycles (inclusive of 
Induction, Consolidation , and Continuation  Phases) . 
The OS analysis will be performed:  
 When the target 287 OS events are observed and a minimum of 24 months has 
elapsed since the last subject was randomized.  
 If the target 287 OS events are not achieved by 24 months since the last subject was 
randomized, th en the analysis will be performed at a maximum of 30 months after the 
last subject is randomized.

follow -up or have  died  
 an alternative  study  becomes available,  for subjects continuing to derive benefit from 
treatment with quizartinib , where the study drug is offered to these  subjects  
 the study is discontinued by the Sponsor for other reasons (administrative,

3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
3.2.1.  Treatment Groups  
Subjects will be randomized to the quizartinib group or placebo group.  
3.2.2.  Study Phases  
In the Induction, Consolidation, and Continuation  Phases, each cycle will be 28 days in duration.  
Additional time is allowed for recovery of blood counts, if needed, in the Induction or 
Consolidation Phases.  
Subjects in remission following the Induction or Consolidation Phases will have their blood 
coun ts monitored at least every 4 weeks and will have a bone marrow aspirate specimen (or a 
core biopsy specimen if aspirate cannot be obtained) collected every 12 weeks for the first 
48 weeks, followed by every 24 weeks for the next 48 weeks, until relapse or  96 weeks have 
passed, whichever occurs first.  For more details see the bone marrow aspirate specimen 
collection in Section  6.2.3  and Section  6.4.2.1.1 . 
3.2.2.1.  Induction Phase (up to 2 cycles)  
During the Induction Phase subjects will be treated with quizartinib  plus the cytarabine and 
anthracycline  regimen or placebo  plus the cytarabine and a nthracycline  regimen .  Subjects are 
permitted to receive up to 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy .   
Cycle 1  
Subjects will begin the cytarabine and a nthracycline  regimen on Day 1.  Cytarabine will be 
administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for a total of 7 days, starting on Day 1 and 
ending on Day 8.  The anthracycline will be administered on Days 1, 2, and 3.  
Subjects will be randomized on Day 7.   If necessary, Randomization  may be performed later 
(eg, Days  8 to 10) to allow time for addressing electrolyte abnormalities, QTcF prolongation, etc.

bone marrow does not provide an accurate assessment of response, the bone marrow procedure 
will be repeated upon count recovery or Day 56 ( ±3 days), whichever occurs first.   Subjects with 
≥ 5% blasts at t he end of Cycle 1 may receive a second cycle of Induction, if appropriate.  At the 
investigator’s discretion, to allow for blood counts to recover or other reasons, the second 
Induction cycle may start up to 60 days after Day 1 of the first Induction cycle . 
Cycle 2  
Subjects will begin the cytarabine and anthracycline regimen on Day 1.  It is recommended to 
wait at least 7 days after the last dose of quizartinib/placebo in Cycle 1 of Induction before 
starting Cycle 2 of Induction, since quizartinib has a lon g elimination half -life and there are no 
data on the safety of administering anthracycline within 7 days following quizartinib 
administration.  For Cycle 2 of Induction, i nvestigators may choose to administer a “7+3” or 
“5+2”  regimen.  
Quizartinib/placebo w ill be administered orally once daily for 14 days.  Dosing will start 
following the end of the cytarabine infusion, normally on Cycle 2, Day 8 or Cycle 2, Day  6, 
depending on the chemot herapy regimen selected by the i nvestigator (ie, “7+3” or “5+2”, 
respec tively).   If quizartinib/placebo administration cannot begin as scheduled, the start of dosing 
may be delayed, but best efforts should be made to begin as soon as possible.   If 
quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, mis sed doses will not be made up.  
On Day 21  (window Day 21 to Day 28), a bone marrow aspirate specimen (or a core biopsy 
specimen if aspirate cannot be obtained) will be collected for local and central pathology.  If this 
bone marrow  does not provide an accurate assessment of response, the bone marrow procedure 
will be repeated upon count recovery or Day 56 (  3 Days), whichever occurs first.   Subjects 
with ≥ 5% blasts at the end of Cycle 1 may receive a second cycle of Induction, if appropriate.  
At the i nvestigator’s discretion, to allow for blood counts to recover or other reasons, the first 
cycle of Consolidation may start up to 60 days after Day 1 of the last Induction cycle.  
See Section  5.4.1  for specific treatment administration requirements during the Induction Phase, 
and Section  6.2.1 , Table  17.1, Table  17.2 and Table  17.3 for all procedures to be done during the 
Induction Phase . 
3.2.2.2.  Consolidation  Phase  
Subjects who achieve a CR or CRi  at the end of the Induction Phase will enter the Consolidation 
Phase.  The following are the o ptions for c onsolidation therapy:  
 Treatment with quizartinib/placebo plus cytarabine (4 cycles, if tolerated); or  
 Allogen eic HSCT; or  
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 52  Treatment with quizartinib/placebo plus cytarabine followed by allogeneic HSCT.  
Cytarabine will be administered by IV infusion every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 5 for a total of 
6 doses.  Quizartinib/placebo will be administered orally once a d ay from Day 6 to Day 19 
(14 days).  If quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, mis sed doses will not be made up.  
Each cycle in the Consolidation Phase will be 28 days in duration.  The sub jects will receive 
4 cycles of c onsolidation therapy, if tolerated.  At the investigator’s discretion, to allow for blood 
counts to recover, the subsequent Consolidation cycle may start up to 60 days aft er Day 1 of the 
previous cycle.  
A bone marrow aspirate specimen (or a core biopsy specimen if aspirate cannot be obtained) will 
be collected for local and central pathology in the first and last cycles of Consolidation, upon 
count recovery from Day 21 to Day 56.  
See Section  4.1.2  for eligibility criteria to proceed into the Consolidation Phase, Section  5.4.2  for 
specific treatment administration requirements during t he Consolidation Phase, and Section  6.2.2  
and Table  17.4 for all procedures to be done during the Consolidation Phase . 
3.2.2.2.1.  Allogeneic Hematopoie tic Stem Cell Transplantation   
Allogeneic HSCT  is one of the options for consolidation therapy, either alone or following 
consolidation treatment with cytarabine and quizartinib/placebo.  Allogeneic HSCT that is 
performed for other reas ons, eg , molecular relapse, will be considered nonprotocol -specified 
AML therapy, and the subject will be discontinued from quizartinib/placebo but will continue to 
be fol lowed for outcome data.  
In general, s ubjects are permitted to undergo allogeneic  HSCT between the end of the Induction 
Phase and the start of the Continuation  Phase.   Under certain circumstances , a subject may 
undergo allogeneic HSCT for consolidation with in the first 3 months of the Continuation Phase 
(see Section  6.2.2.2 ).   
The i nvestigator will be responsible to contact the transplant center on a regular basis to collect 
required data.  Once the subject is able, the subject will return to the clinic for site visits every 
4 weeks.   See Section  6.2.2.2  and Table  17.5 for details.  
For subjects who undergo allogeneic HSCT, treatment with q uizartinib/placebo should be 
discontinued 7  days before the start of a conditioning regimen.  Subjects may begin continuation 
therapy anytime between 30 to 180 days after the allogeneic HSCT.  The site should follow their 
local procedures for allogeneic HS CT conditioning and recovery.  
Subjects are not permitted to undergo autologous  HSCT at any time during the study.  Subjects 
who undergo autologous HSCT will be discontinued from quizartinib/placebo but will continue 
to be followed for outcome data.  
3.2.2.3.  Continu ation  Phase (up to 36 cycles ) 
Following c onsolidation therapy, subjects will enter the Continuation  Phase if they meet the 
inclusion criteria (see Section  4.1.3).  In addition, per i nvestigator discretion, subjects who have 
achieved CR or CRi following Induction,  but who are unable to receive c onsolidation therapy, 
will be permitted to enter the Cont inuation  Phase if they meet the inclusion criteria.  
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 53 During the Continuation  Phase subjects will be treated with quizartinib/placebo  once daily for up 
to 36 cycles .  Continuation  therapy  will begin after i nduction or c onsolidation therapy, including 
allogen eic HSCT, and will continue until relapse, start of nonprotocol specified AML treatment, 
death, unacceptable toxicity, study close, or completion of 36 cycles , whichever occurs first . 
The cycles during the Continuation  Phase will be 28 days each, with no b reaks in dosing 
between cycles.  If quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, missed doses will not be m ade up.  
Subjects will have their blood counts monitored at least every 4 weeks and will have a bone 
marrow exam every 12 weeks for 48 weeks and then every 24 weeks until week 96 . 
See Section  4.1.3  for eligibility criteria to proceed into the Continuation  Phase, Section  5.4.3  for 
specific treatment administration requirements during the Continuation  Phase, and Section  6.2.3  
and Table  17.6 for all procedures to be done during the Continuation  Phase . 
3.2.2.4.  Long Term Follow -up Phase  
Subjects who complete 36 cycles  of quizartinib/placebo in the Continuation  Phase or 
permanently discontinue quizartinib/placebo in the Induction, Consolidation, or Continuation  
Phases will enter the Long -term Follow -up Phase, as detailed in Section  6.4.2 .

Page 57 5. STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
5.1. Assigning Subjects to Treatments and Blinding  
5.1.1.  Treatment Group(s)  
Subjects will be randomized to either the quizartinib group or the placebo group.  
5.1.2.  Method of Treatment Allocation  
Subjects will be randomized into 1 of the 2 treatment groups (qui zartinib or placebo) in a 
1:1 ratio.  The randomization  will be stratified by age, region, and WBC count at the time of 
diagnosis of AML.  Randomization  will be managed through an Interactive Web/Voice 
Response System (IXRS).  
5.1.3.  Blinding  
This study has a doub le-blind design.  Quizartinib is supplied as 20 mg and 30 mg tablets.  
Placebo is supplied as tablets that match the appearance of the quizartinib 20 mg and 30 mg 
tablets.  Neither the subjects nor  any of the investigators, s ponsor, or contract research 
organizations (CROs) will be aware of the treatments received.  
An independent biostatistician, not otherwise part of the sponsor study team, will generate the 
randomization  schedule.  
5.1.4.  Emergency Unb linding  Procedure  
In the case of an emergenc y where, in the o pinion of the i nvestigator, the study treatment 
assignment must be unblinded in order to evaluate further a course of medical trea tment, it is 
required that the i nvestigator discuss the case  with the Medical Monitor, but the discussion may 
occur after unbl inding if the subject requires emergency treatment.  (Contact information – refer 
to the study reference materials).  
In the event of unblinding, information about the treatment assignment must be  restricted to 
designated Study Center staff/personnel that are providing immediate care to the subject.  Any 
documentation of the treatment assignment must be  maintained separately (ie, a secured file).  
The information must not be  included in the subject ’s primary  source files to ensure the 
treatment assignment will remain blinded to the Sponsor and study personnel not involved with 
the subject’s immediate care.  
5.2. Study Drug s 
5.2.1.  Quizartinib  
Quizartinib is supplied to the Study Center as 20 mg tablets or 30 mg tablets.   Each 20 mg tablet 
contains 20 mg quizartinib dihydrochloride (17.7 mg free base), and each 30 mg tablet contains 
30 mg quizartinib dihydrochloride (26.5 mg free base) .

manual.  
5.2.6.  Storage  
Double -blind study drug supplies (quizartinib or matching placebo) must be stored appropriately 
in a locked cabinet/room with limite d and controlled access under the recommended storage 
conditions.  The required storage conditions are provided in the pharmacy manual.  
NOTE:  If storage conditions go outside of the recommended storage conditions, the Study 
Center must not dispense the aff ected supplies (affected supplies should be placed in 
quarantine per IXRS requirements).  Proper notification processes must be followed 
immediately after receipt of quizartinib/placebo identified as having a temperature 
excursion.  
5.2.7.  Drug Accountability  
When  a dru g shipment is received, the i nvestigator or designee will check the amount and 
condition of the drug.  
In addition, the i nvestigator or designee shall contact the Sponsor as soon as possible if there is a 
problem with the shipment.  This process is al so documented on the Shipment Temperature 
Record and Excursion Reporting Form that is included with each shipment.

Page 59 subject’s identification number and/or initials  or supply number (as applicable), the date and 
quantity of quizartinib/placebo dispensed and remaining (in tablets),  as well as the initials of the 
dispenser . 
At the end of the study, or as directed, all quizartinib/placebo supplies, including unused, 
partially used, or empty containers, will either be destroyed at the site or be returned to a 
designee as instructed by Sponsor.  Quizartinib/placebo will be ret urned or destroyed locally 
only after the study monitor has completed a final inventory to verify the quantity to be returned.  
The return of quizartinib/placebo must be documented and the documentation included in the 
shipment.  At the end of the study, a  final reconciliation statement of quizartinib/pl acebo must be 
completed by the i nvestigator or designee and provided to the Sponsor.  Unused supplies of 
quizartinib/p lacebo may be destroyed by the i nvestigator when approved in writing by Sponsor 
and Spons or has received copies of the study center’s drug handling and disposition standard 
operating procedures and it is assured that the sponsor will receive copies of the certificate of 
destruction  which is traceable to the quizartinib/placebo tablets.  Destru ction of study drug at the 
Study Center is preferred.  
5.3. Standard Chemotherapy  
Subjects will receive commercially available cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) and anthracycline 
(daunorubicin or idarubicin).  
Refer to the cytarabine and anthracycline package ins ert or appropriate local (ie, country 
specific) labeling for detailed description of administration and potential risks associated with 
cytarabine and anthracycline.  
Dose adjustments for renal and hepatic function are permitted per local package insert, l abeling, 
or institutional guidelines.  
5.4. Administration  
This section describes the administration of double -blind study drug (quizartinib or matching 
placebo) as well as induction and consolidation chemotherapy . 
Quizartinib/placebo can be taken either with or  without food.   Subjects should be encouraged to 
take quizartinib/placebo at the same time every day (for example, the morning) to encourage 
compliance.  If the subject omits to take quizartinib in the morning, it may be taken later in the 
day (until midni ght); otherwise the dose is considered missed.  If the subject vomits after taking 
quizartinib/placebo, no replacement dose should be given.   If quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, 
missed doses will not be made up.  Do not double the dose of quizartinib/placebo the next day if 
a dose was missed.  
If quizartinib/placebo administration cannot begin as scheduled, the start of dosing may be 
delayed in each cycle.  If delayed, best efforts should be made to begin administration of 
quizartini b/placeb o as soon as possible.  
5.4.1.  Induction Phase (up to 2 cycles)  
Subjects are permitted to receive up to 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy .  Subjects with 
≥5%  blasts, per the Cycle 1 Days 21 to 28 bone marrow (or a later bone marrow if the Days 21 to 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 60 28 bone marro w does not allow for an accurate assessment of response), may receive a second 
cycle of induction chemotherapy , if appropriate.  
Cycle 1  
Cycle 1, Day 1 is defined as the start date of the chemotherapy infusions.  
Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) 100 mg/m2/day (200 mg/m2/day allowed if this is the 
institutional or local standard) will be administered by continuous IV infusion for a total of 
7 days, starting on Day 1 and ending on Day 8.  
One of the fol lowing anthracycline regimens (i nvestigator’s choice) wil l be administered:  
 Daunorubicin 60 mg/m2/day IV infusion on Days 1, 2, and 3; or  
 Idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day IV infusion on Days 1, 2, and 3.  
Subjects will be randomized on Day 7.  If necessary, Randomization  may be performed later 
(eg, Days 8 to 10) to allow time for addressing electrolyte abnormalities, QTcF prolongation, etc.  
Quizartinib/placebo will be administered orally once daily for 14 days.  Dosing should start 
following the end of the cytarabine infusion, normally on Day 8.  If quizartin ib/placebo 
administration cannot begin as scheduled, the start of dosing may be delayed, but best efforts 
should be made to start within 3 days of Randomization  if possible.  If quizartinib/placebo 
cannot be started within 3 days of Randomization , please c ontact the Medical Monitor.  The dose 
will be 40 mg/day (2 × 20 mg tablets).  For subjects concomitantly receiving a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor, the dose will be reduced from 40 mg/day to 20 mg/day (Section  5.6.4 ).  If 
quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, mis sed doses will not be made up.  
Cycle 2  
At the i nvestigator’s discretion, to allow for blood counts to recover or other reasons, the second 
Induction c ycle may start up to 60 days after Day 1 of the first Induction cycle.  It is 
recommended to wait at least 7 days after the last dose of quizartinib/placebo in Cycle 1 of 
Induction before starting Cycle 2 of Induction, since quizartinib has a long eliminat ion half -life 
and there are no data on the safety of administering anthracycline within 7 days following 
quizartinib administration.  
For Cycle 2 of Induction, i nvestigators may choose to administer 1 of the following:  
 “7+3” chemotherapy regimen, defined as  7 days of continuous IV infusion of 
standard dose cytarabine plus 3 days of anthracycline (the same anthracycline must be 
used throughout the Induction phase); OR  
 “5+2” chemotherapy regimen, defined as 5 days of continuous IV infusion of 
standard dose cyt arabine plus 2 days of anthracycline (the same anthracycline must be 
used throughout the Induction Phase).  
Quizartinib/placebo will be administered orally once daily for 14 days.  Dosing will start 
following the end of the cytarabine infusion, normally on Cycle 2 , Day 8 or Cycle 2 , Day 6, 
depending on the chemot herapy regimen selected by the i nvestigator (ie, “7+3” or “5+2”, 
respectively).   If quizartinib/placebo administration cannot begin as scheduled, the start of dosing 
may be delayed, but best efforts should be made to begin as soon as possible.  The dose will be 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 61 40 mg/day.  For subjects concomitantly receiving a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose will be 
reduced from 40 mg/day to 20 mg/day.  If quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, missed do ses will 
not b e made up.  
5.4.2.  Consolidation Phase  
Cytarabine will be given on Days 1, 3, and 5.  The cytarabine regimen will be:  
 for subjects <60 years old: cytarabine 3.0 g/m2 by IV infusion, every 12 hours for a 
total of 6 doses; or  
 for subjects ≥60 years old: cytarabine  1.5 g/m2 by IV infusion, every 12 hours for a 
total of 6 doses.  
Subjects who are unable to tolerate a full cycle of consolidation chemotherapy  are not required to 
complete the full cycle of chemotherapy in any cycle during the Consolidation Phase (4 Cycle s, 
if tolerated).  
Quizartinib/placebo will be administered orally once daily for 14 days starting on Day 6.  If 
quizartinib/placebo dosing cannot begin as scheduled, the start of dosing may be delayed but best 
efforts should be made to begin as soon as pos sible.  The dose will be 40 mg/day (2 × 20 mg 
tablets).  The dose will be reduced from 40 mg/day to 20 mg/day (1 × 20 mg tablet) when 
subjects are concomitantly receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( Section  5.6.4 ).  If 
quizartinib/placebo is interrupted, mis sed doses will not be made up . 
5.4.3.  Continuation  Phase (up to 36 cycles ) 
Quizartinib/placebo continuation  therapy will begin after induction or consolidation therapy 
(including allogeneic HSCT) upon blood count recovery ANC >500/mm3 and platelet count 
>50,000/mm3 without a platelet transfusion within 24 hours of drawing blood samples).  
Quizartinib/placebo will be administered orally once daily sta rting on Day 1, with no breaks in 
dosing between cycles.  If quizartinib is interrupted, missed doses will not be made up.  
Quizartinib/placebo continuation  therapy will cont inue for up to 36 cycles  after induction or 
consolidation,  (as defined in Section  3.2.2.3 ) until : relapse, start of nonprotocol specified AML 
treatment, death, unacceptable toxicity,  study close , or completion of 36 cycles, whichever 
occurs  first. 
The dose of quizartinib/placebo on Cycle 1, Days 1 to 15 will be 30 mg (1 × 30 mg tablet) orally 
once daily.  On Cycle 1, Day 16, the dose will be increased to 60 mg/day (2  × 30 mg tablets) if 
the average QTcF of the triplicate ECGs  is ≤450 ms on Cycle 1, Day 15.  Once the dose is 
increased to 60 mg/day, the subject may continue on this dose as long as dose reduction is not 
needed.  
For subjects concomitantly receiving a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose of quizartinib/placebo 
on Cycl e 1, Days 1 to 15 will be 20mg (1 × 20mg tablet) orally once daily.  On Cycle 1, Day 16, 
the dose will be increased to 30mg/day (1 × 30mg tablets) if the average QTcF of the triplicate 
ECG is ≤450 ms on Cycle 1, Day 15.  
If the dose of quizartinib/placebo i s not able to be increased on Cycle 1, Day 16, the dose may be 
increased on Cycle 2, Day 2 if the average QTcF of the triplicate ECG is ≤450 ms on Cycle 2, 
Day 1.

Page 62 Subjects who permanently discontinued quizartinib/placebo because they completed 12 cycles of  
continuation therapy ( as required in protocol Versions 1.0 and 2.0) may be restarted at the 
discretion of the investigator after discussion with the Medical Monitor.   Subjects who restart 
therapy will receive double -blind continuation therapy in the same treatment group (quizartinib 
or placebo) to which they were randomized.  
5.5. Control Treatment  
The control treatment will be placebo tablets matching the appearance of quizartinib 20  mg and 
30 mg tablets.  
5.6. Quizartinib/Placebo Dose Reductions and Dosing Interruptions  
The following are reasons for quizartinib/placebo dose reduction or dosing interruption:  
 Adverse event: QTcF prolongation, other non -hematologic toxicities, or 
myelosuppression;  
 Concomitant administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor  
See Table  5.1 for guidance on dose reductions and interruptions of quizartinib/placebo during the 
Induction, Consolidation, and Continuation  Phases.  
The dose  of quizartinib/placebo will not be reduced lower than 30 mg/day in any phase of the 
study (not lower than 20 mg/day for subjects receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors).  
If quizartinib/placebo is interrupt ed, doses will not be made up.

5.6.1.  QTcF Prolongation - Dose Interruptions and Reductions  
Subjects taking quizartinib/placebo who experience QTcF prolongation >480 ms should be 
managed according to the guidelines below.   For all episodes of QTc prolongation, regardless of 
grade, c heck electrolyte (potassium, calcium , and magnesium) levels and correct any 
abnormalities.  If possible, stop any medications that may prolong the QT interval.  
QTcF >480 ms ≤500 ms 
 The dose of quizartinib/placebo will be reduced one level without interrupt ion of 
dosing.  
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 64  Following dose reduction, the quizartinib/placebo dose may be resumed at the 
previous level in the next cycle if the QTcF has decreased to within 30 ms of baseline 
or <450 ms but subject must be monitored closely for QT prolongation for the first 
cycle at the increased dose.  
QTcF >500 ms 
 Quizartinib/placebo dosing will be interrupted for up to 14 days.  If QTcF returns to 
within 30 ms of baseline or <450 ms within 14 days, quizartinib/placebo 
administration may be resumed at a reduced dose (reduce by one level).  
 If QTcF >500 ms occurs during the Induction or Consolidation Phases, and if no 
cause other than quizartinib/placebo can be identified, then during t he Continuation  
Phase, the dose of quizartinib/placebo cannot be escalated to 60 mg/day.  
Recurrent QTcF>500 ms  
 Permanently discontinue quizartinib/placebo if QTcF >500 ms recurs despite 
appropriate dose reduction and correction/elimination of other risk fa ctors (eg, serum 
electrolyte abnormalities, concomitant QT prolonging medication)  
QTcF >500 ms or >60 ms change from baseline, and Torsade de pointes or polymorphic 
ventricular tachycardia or signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia  
 Quizartinib/placebo dosing will be permanently discontinued.  
5.6.1.1.  Managing QTc Prolongation  
Electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium) should be checked and supplementation given 
to correct any values outside the institution’s  normal range .  If an electrolyte abnormality is 
identif ied, subjects should be monitored more frequently until levels normalize.  Appropriate 
management should include ECG monitoring, reduction of serum electrolyte losses, replacement 
of electrolyte stores , and evaluation and treatment of associated toxicit ies. 
Subjects should be monitored for the presence of hypokalemia at least 3 times per week during 
the Induction and Consolidation Phases of the study (see Section  6.2.1 , Section  6.2.2.1 , 
Section  17.1.1 , and Section  17.1.2  for further details).  If hypokalemia occurs, oral or IV 
potassium supplementation should be administered, as clinically indicated, and serial potassium 
level monitoring should be performed until potass ium levels normalize.  In addition, the 
underlying cause of hyp okalemia should be investigated  to prevent further episodes , if possible.   
If Grade 3 hypokalemia occurs (potassium 3 mmol/L), IV potassium replacement, close subject 
follow -up, continuous ECG  monitoring , and serial potassium level  monitoring  every 2 to 4 hours 
until recovery to Grade 1 should be considered.  
Subjects should also be monitored for the presence of concomitant hypomagnesemia  and 
hypocalcemia (using the institution’s normal ranges)  and, if present , then replacement therapy 
should be initiated.   In addition, the underlying cause of these electrolyte abnor malities should be 
investigated  to prevent further episodes , if possible.  
Concomitant medications should be reviewed to identify and , if appropriate, discontinue any 
medication with known QT prolonging effects ( Table  17.8). 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 65 Subjects who experience >480 ms QTcF prolongation and under go dose interruption and/or 
reduction must be monitored closely with ECGs, performed twice weekly for the first week of 
the QTcF prolongation and then weekly thereafter until the QTcF prolongation is resolved.  
5.6.2.  Non-Hematologic Toxicity  
The following guidel ines should be followed for subjects who develop Grade 3 or 4 
non-hematologic toxicity that is at least possibly related to quizartinib/placebo and persisting 
>48 hours without improvement to ≤ Grade 2 or with out waiting 48 hours if in the i nvestigator ’s 
judgment the AE poses a serious risk to the subject:  
 Dosing will be interrupted for up to 28 days.  
 If toxicity improves to ≤ Grade 1 within 28 days, treatment may be resumed at the 
previous dose.  
 If toxicity improves to ≤ Grade 2 within 28 days, treatment may be resumed at a 
reduced dose (1 level).  
 If toxicity does not improve/resolve within 28 days, then quizartinib/placebo will 
be discontinued.  
5.6.2.1.  Hepatic Events and Liver Enzyme Elevation  
Elevation of liver enzymes that meet the criteria below should be inve stigated and the cause 
identified when possible:  
 ALT >8 × ULN; or  
 AST or ALT >5 × ULN for more than two weeks; or  
 ALT or AST >3 × ULN, but not reaching the limits in the above criteria, in 
combination with clinical symptoms suggestive of hepatitis; or  
  ALT or AST >3 × ULN with TBL >2 × ULN.  
Once the cause of liver enzyme elevation is identified, remove or treat the contributing cause.   If 
the above criteria are met and the elevation is considered to be related or possibly related to 
quizartinib/placebo,  then quizartinib/placebo dosing should be interrupted.  
Liver enzyme level testing will be repeated at least weekly, or more frequently, based on degree 
of hepatic laboratory abnormality.  If the liver enzyme levels return to baseline levels, 
quizartinib/p lacebo may be resumed at the full dose.  If toxicity does not improve/resolve within 
28 days, then quizartinib/placebo will be discontinued.  
Upon resumption of quizartinib/placebo, if liver enzyme elevations recur, treatment may be 
resumed at a reduced dos e following return to baseline levels.  
5.6.2.1.1.  Liver Safety Monitoring and Evaluations  
Any subject who temporarily interrupts or permanently discontinues quizartinib/placebo due to 
confirmed liver enzyme abnormalities and/or jaundice in the absence of a known caus e, must 
have an evaluation to determine the cause of the event.  
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 66 Evaluation may include the following depending on the clinical situation:  
 Medical history and physical exam, including focus on medications and substances 
used: alcohol, acetaminophen, azole antifungals, change in medication dosages, new 
medications added, over the counter medication use and recreational drug use.  Check 
for change in diet or use of dietary supplements;  
 Abdominal ultrasound;  
 Hepatitis A, B, C, and E screening (anti -hepatitis A  virus immunoglobulin M, 
hepatitis B surface antigen, anti -hepatitis C virus plus viral titer, and evaluation for 
Hepatitis E), antinuclear antibody and anti -Smith antibody, cytomegalovirus, Epstein 
Barr virus;  
 Additional evaluation s as deemed appropriate by the i nvestigator to exclude other 
causes of liver enzyme and bilirubin elevations;  
 All laboratory results, including local laboratory reference ranges are to be recorded.  
5.6.2.2.  Sweet’s Syndrome (Acute Febrile Neutrophilic Dermatosis)  
Sweet's syndrome can be i diopathic, malignancy associated, or drug induced.37  The incidence of 
drug-induced Sweet’s syndrome (DISS) following FLT3 inhibitor monotherapy is approximately 
10% during the treatment period in the setting of relapsed/refractory AML.38  DISS is unlikely to 
occur in the setting of concurrent cytoreduction with traditional chemotherapy due to suppression 
of terminal differentiation of FLT 3-ITD myeloblasts and associated clinical manifestations.  
Diagnostic criteria for DISS include abrupt onset of painful erythematous plaques or nodules, 
pyrexia >38°C, temporal relationship between drug ingestion and clinical presentation, 
temporally relat ed resolution of lesions after drug withdrawal or treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids, and histopathologic evidence of a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence 
of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.  Cardiac, pulmonary,  and upper airway neutrophil inf iltration can 
present as life -threatening emergencies.37  
The symptoms of neutrophilic dermatosis can generally be managed with systemic corticoster oid 
administration.  Other first -line systemic treatments for Sweet's syndrome include potassium 
iodide and colchicine.37  The interruption or discon tinuation of quizartinib is usually not 
required38, 39 and discussion with the Medical Monitor is optional.  However, for advanced 
Grade 3 or 4 toxicities the decision to continue, interrupt or discontinue quizartinib therapy must 
be made b y the i nvestigator based on the individual subject’s condition, taking into account the 
risks and benefits of continuing quizartinib/placebo therapy, and in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor.  
5.6.2.3.  Pyoderma Gangrenosum  
Pyoderma gangrenosum  is characterized by multiple cutaneous ulcers with mucopurulent or 
hemorrhagic exudate.40  This sterile neutrophilic dermatosis is known to occur in association 
with malignancy, infection, autoimmune disorders and drugs, eg, tyrosine kinase inhibitors.41  
There is no diagnostic test, since it is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Extracutaneous manifestations of 
this neutrophilic dermatosis are reported somewhat less commonly than with Sweet’s syndrome.  
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 67 As with Sweet’s Syndrome, the symptoms of neutrophilic dermatosis can generally be managed 
with systemic and/or topical corticosteroid administration, and discussion with the Medical 
Monitor is optional.40  More severe cases may require immunosuppressive or 
immunomodulatory agents.  For advanced Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, the decision to continue, 
interrupt or discontinue quizartin ib therapy must be made by the investigator based on the 
individual subject’s condition, taking into account the risks and benefits of continuing 
quizartinib/placebo therapy, and in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
5.6.2.4.  Differentiation Syndrome  
Quizartinib can cause terminal differenti ation of AML blast cells in patients with relapsed or 
refractory disease, which may be associated with the development of differentiation syndrome 
and may be life -threatening or fatal if not treated.  
Symptoms of differentiation syndrome are dyspnea, fever,  peripheral edema, hypotension, 
weight gain, pleuro -pericardial effusion, acute renal failure, musculoskeletal pain, and 
hyperbilirubinemia.  Less commonly, differentiation syndrome  might present with pulmonary 
hemorrhage or acute febrile neutrophilic derm atosis.   Please refer to the current Quizartinib IB  
for additional details on differentiation syndrome.2 
It is important to promptly recognize the signs and symptoms of differentiation syndrome and 
implement appropriate treatment.  Subjects  with suspected differentiation syndrome should 
promptly start treatment with systemic glucocorticoids and hemodynamic mo nitoring until 
improvement.  
Please refer to Section  5.6.2  for guidance on quizartinib dose interruption and/or reduction . 
5.6.3.  Myelosuppression ( Continuat ion Phase)  
In the Continuation  Phase, the dose of quizartinib/placebo may be reduce d at the i nvestigator’s 
discretion if:  
 The subject enters the C ontinuation Phase with hematologic recovery (CR or CRi 
[ANC ≥1000 /mm3 and/or platelet count  is ≥100,000/mm3]) and the p latelet count 
becomes  <100 ,000/mm3 and/or ANC is 1000 /mm3 or;  
 The subject enters the C ontinuation Phase without hematologic recovery (ANC 
>500/mm3 and < 1000 /mm3 and/or platelet count > 50,000 /mm3 and <100,000 /mm3 
without transfusion support)  and the subject has bee n on continuation therapy for 
≥8 weeks . 
The dose of quizartinib/placebo may be reduced stepwise fr om 60 mg/day to 40 mg/day to 
30 mg/day.  For subjects experiencing myelosuppression requiring dose reduction while taking a 
dose of 30  mg/day (20 mg/day in subjects receiving a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), dosing will be 
interrupted.

Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 68 5.6.4.  Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors – Dose Modifications  
For subjects receiving a concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose of quizartinib/placebo 
will be reduced as follows:  
 Induction and Consolidation Phases: The dose of quizartinib/placebo will be reduced 
from 40 mg/day to 20 mg/day.  
 Continuation  Phase: The dose of quizartinib/placebo will be reduced from 30 mg/day 
to 20 mg (eg, Cycle 1, Days 1 to 15), or from 60 m g to 30 mg (Day 16 onward).  
Once the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, the dose of quizartinib/placebo will be 
resumed at the full dose (Table  5.1) when the inhibitor is withdrawn .  No washout is required 
for the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor before increasing the dose of quizartinib/placebo back to 
the full dose.   
No dose reduction is required when subjects are coadministered a moderate or weak CYP3A4 
inhibitor.  See Table  17.9 for a list of strong CYP3A4 inhibit ors. 
5.7. Method of Assessing Treatment Compliance  
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance.  
 In the Induction Phase, all subjects in this study will commence therapy as hospital 
inpatients and oral quizartinib/placebo will be admin istered under nursing 
supervision.  
 Subjects discharged from the hospital with quizartinib/placebo during the 
Consolidation and Continuation  Phases shall return as noted in the Schedule of 
Events for each Phase, Table  17.4 and Table  17.6, respectively, and compliance will 
be assessed by the returned tablet count.  
5.8. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
5.8.1.  Prior Medication  
All medications received by subjects within 28 days prior to Randomization  will be recorded as 
prior medications.  
5.8.2.  Concomitant Medication (Drugs and Therapies)  
Concomitant medications and the rapies include all prescription, over -the-counter, and herbal 
remedies.  
Information on concomitant medications will be collected from Randomization  through 30 days 
after the last dose of quizartinib/placebo (does not apply to the allogeneic HSCT period unt il the 
subject is able to return to the site, see Section  6.2.2.2 ).  However, information on subsequent 
anti-leukemic treatments will be collected th roughout the Long -Term Follow -up Phase.  Data 
collected will include medication name, indication, dose, start date, and stop date.  
If a subjec t experiences nausea and/or vomiting after the first dose of quizartinib/placebo , the 
subjec t should receive antie metics as clinically indicated prior to and after administration of 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 69 quizartinib/placebo .  If a subjec t vomits after quizartinib/placebo  dosing, a replacement dose of 
quizartinib/placebo  will not be administered.  
Dexamethasone or an equivalent ophthalmic st eroid preparation (0.1% ophthalmic solution, 
starting 12 hours before and for 24 - 48 hours after completion of cytarabine), or Isotears may be 
used to prevent conjunctival and corneal pain.  
Menstruating females may receive Depo -Provera or another suppress ant of menses during the 
entire course of this protocol.  Suppression of menses should be continued until the platelet count 
is ≥50 ,000/mm3 without transfusion support.  
5.8.2.1.  Supportive Care  
During the Induction Phase, growth factors (granulocyte -colony stimulating factor [G -CSF]) 
may be considered for subjects who are septic and who have a life -threatening infection, 
according to the Institutional standard of care.  
Growth factors (G -CSF) may be administered during the Consolidation Phase.  Growth factors  
(G-CSF) and pegylated G -CSF must be stopped 7 and 14 days, respectively, prior to the bone 
marrow aspiration in the absence of an urgent medical need for continuing G -CSF 
administration.  
Antibiotics (eg, quinolone), antifungals, and antivirals may be used  as standard of care for the 
prevention or treatment of infections.  See Section 5.6.4  for dose requirements if these 
medications are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
5.8.3.  Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects may not receive concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, transplant, 
or any ancillary therapy for AML that is not specified in the protocol, or that is considered to be 
investigational (ie, used for non -approved indications(s) and in the context of a research 
investigation) while on quizartinib/placebo.  See Section  4.2 (exclusion criterion 3) for permitted 
prior therapy.  Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after allogeneic HSCT is permitted.  
Medications associated with QT/QTc pro longations are prohibited and are detailed in 
Appendix  17.4.  Exceptions are made for antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals that are used as 
stand ard of care for the prevention or tre atment of infections or if the i nvestigator believes that 
beginning therapy with a potentially QTc -prolonging medication (such as anti -emetic) is vital to 
an individual subject’s care while on study.  In that case , additional ECG monitoring will be 
performed at the commencement of such a medication or from when there is an increase in its 
dosage.  See Section  5.6.1  for guidelines on monitoring and managing QTc prolongation.  
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided if possible but may be given with a corresponding 
dose reduction for quizartinib/placebo.  There are no restrictions for moderate or weak CYP3A4 
inhibitors (See Table  17.9).  
Strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers  must not be used.  
If quizartinib is co -administered with drugs that are substrates of P -gp, increased concentrations 
of the substrate drugs are possible and caution should be exercised.

5.9. Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
5.9.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Quizartinib/placebo will be permanently discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
 Adverse Event:  
 Intolerable AE  related to quizartinib/placebo, including Grade 4 QTcF 
prolongation;  
 Any clinical AE or abnormal laboratory test result indicating, in the i nvestigator’s 
opinion, that continued quizartinib/placebo dosing is not in the subject’s best 
interest;  
 Death;  
 Refractory disease, as defined in Section  7.2;  
 Relapse, as defined in Section  7.2; 
 Institution of nonprotocol specified AML therapy (prophylactic intrathecal therapy 
and DLI are permitted);  
 Pregnancy (see Section  9.6); 
 Withdrawal by subject  (from  study drug ).  NOTE: A subject ’s decision to 
discontinue study drug is not the same as complete withdrawal from the study.  If a 
subject decides to stop study drug, the investigator should discuss with the subject 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 71 that he or she  will remain in the study  (ie, continue with study visits an d assessments, 
including EFS/OS follow -up); 
 Study Terminated by Sponsor . 
Investigators should contact the Medical Monitor if they want to permanently discontinue 
quizartinib/placebo for reasons other than those listed above.  Permanent discontinuations of 
quizartinib/placebo including the reason should be recorded.  
In case of questions regarding continuati on of quizartinib/placebo, the i nvestigator should 
consult with the Medical Monitor.  
5.9.1.1.  Long -Term Follow -up of Subjects after Permanent Discontinuation of St udy 
Drug  
The Long -Term Follow -up Phase begins upon completion of 36 cycles  of quizartinib/placebo in 
the Continuation  Phase or permanent discontinuation of quizartinib/placebo in any phase.  See 
Section 6.4 for details on long -term follow -up requirements.  
5.9.2.  Withdrawal from Study  
The total duration of subject participation in the study will be until one of the following occurs:  
 Subject death;  
 Study closure or termination;  
 Subject withdrawal of consent from study participation (see Section  5.9.2.1 ); or 
 Subject lost to follow -up (see Secti on 5.9.2.2 ).  
If a subject is withdrawn  from the stu dy, the i nvestigator will complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible up to t he date of withdrawal including the date of last 
treatment and the reason for withdrawal.  
All subjects who are withdrawn from the study should complete protocol -specified withdrawal 
procedures.  
5.9.2.1.  Withdrawal of Consent from Study Participation  
In accordance w ith the Declaration of Helsinki and other applicable regulations, a subject has the 
right to withdraw consent from study participation at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to his or her future medical care by the investigator or at the Study Ce nter. 
Only subjects who refuse all of the following methods of follow -up will be considered to have 
withdrawn consent from study participation:  
 Attendance at study visits per protocol;  
 Study personnel contacting the subject by telephone (may be quarterly, bi-annually, 
annually, or only at end of study);

Page 72  Trial personnel accessing and reviewing the subject’s med ical information from 
alternative sources (eg, doctor’s notes, hospital records).  
If the subject refuses all of the a bove methods of follow -up, the i nvestigator should personally 
speak to the subject to ensure the subject understands all of the potential methods of follow -up.  
If the subject continues to refuse all poten tial methods of follow up, the i nvestigator will 
document this as a withdrawal of consent in the medical record and in the case report form.  
For subjects who withdraw consent as define abov e, study personnel will use local, regional, and 
national public records (in accordance with local law) to monitor vital status.  
5.9.2.2.  Subjects Lost to Follow -up 
The investigator will make every effort not to have any subjects Lost to Follow -up.  If a subject 
is potentially Lost to Follow -up (eg, missed study visits, unable to be contacted by phone), the 
investigator will make every effort to contact the subject before the subject is declared Lost to 
Follow -up (see Study Operations Manual for details).  Once the  Study Center has exhausted a nd 
documented all actions, the i nvestigator should contact the study monitor for additional guidance 
and alternative options.  
Subjects will not be classified as Lost to Follow -up unless all actions have been exhausted and 
docum ented.

Page 73 6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A tabular summary of the visit schedule for the study is provided in Appendix  17.1. 
During the various phases of the study a  bone marrow aspirate will be required.  If the aspirate is 
not sufficient or not feasible to obtain, then a core biopsy specimen may be obtained.  In 
addition, if an unscheduled bone marrow examination is performed during any phase of the 
study, an aspira te specimen must be shipped to both the local and central laborator ies for 
assessment and a blood sample shou ld be obtained for hematology.  
The FLT3 -ITD MRD assessment is for the purposes of this study  and results will therefore not 
be available until after the end of the study.  
Laboratory reports with all  local laboratory results from samples collected in all phases for 
hematology, serum chemistry (including potassium monitoring  as well as hypomagnesem ia and 
hypocal cemia ), and coagulation are to be sent to the central laboratory  for data entry . 
Throughout the treatment period, urine or serum pregnancy tests are to be done at monthly 
intervals for women of childbearing potential (as defined in Section  4.1.1 ). 
6.1. Screening (Days -7 to 6)  
6.1.1.  Overview of Screening  
Subjects with newly diagnosed, morphologically documented AML ( Section  4.1.1 ) will be 
screened.  The Screening period is the time from 7 days prior to the start of induction 
chemotherapy  up to the day of Randomization .  It is anticipated that subjects will recently have 
had some or all of the screening tests done as part of routine care outside the auspices of this 
study.  Results of these tests done as part of routine care may be used to qualify the subject (see 
timing r equirements in Section  6.1.2 ).  The subject does not need to repeat recently completed 
procedures/tests for study qualification.  
Written informed co nsent must be obtained before any study -specific procedure is performed, 
including sending a bone marrow aspirate specimen (done as routine care) to the central 
laboratory for assessment of FLT3 -ITD activating mutation.  A separate screening ICF may be 
used to obtain consent to send the sample to the central laboratory, if desired.  
Full documentation for the qualifying test results is required, including those done as part of 
routine care outside the auspices of this study.  
6.1.2.  Screening Procedures  
The followi ng activities and/or assessments will be performed at/during Screening:  
 Review the subject's demographics, medical and AML  disease history , including 
cytogenetic risk classification42, and results of tests done as part of routine care and 
compare against the eligibility criteria (see Section  4) for randomization ; 
 Have the subject sign the ICF (must be done before any study -specific procedures are 
performed);  
 Obtain subject identification number;

routine care within 7 days prior to the start of induction chemotherapy  may be used to 
qualify the subject):  
 Physical examination (Section  9.10);  
 Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and temperature), height, 
weight, and body surface area (BSA);  
 12-lead EC G (does not need to be performed on the study -supplied ECG 
machine);  
 MUGA  or echocardiogram performed within 30 days prior to  Randomization  
(subjects must have LVEF >45%) ; if not done as part of routine care, a MUGA or 
echocardiogram must be done and LVEF must be >45% ; 
 Laboratory tests ( Table  17.19): 
o Hematology;  
o Chemistry;  
o Coagulation;  
o Urinalysis;  
o HIV (if required by local regulations)  
 For women of childbearing potential (as defined in Section  4.1.1 ) document the 
results of a negative serum pregnancy test (if not performed as a part of routine 
care within 14 days of Randomization , must be performed with the results 
available prior to Randomization ); 
 Copies of de-identified  local pathology report from the bone marrow aspirate  for 
submission to IRC; 
 Assess and record the subject’s ECOG performance status;  
 Record all serious AEs (SAEs) related to any study procedure experienced by the 
subject since the initial ICF (FLT3 -ITD Screening if applicable or Main Study) was 
signed and up to the day of Randomization ;

Page 75 6.2. Treatment Period  
6.2.1.  Induction Phase (up to 2 c ycles)  
A specimen from all protocol -specified bone marrow aspirates (or a core biopsy specimen if 
aspirate cannot be obtained) must be sent to both the local and central laboratories for 
assessment.   In addition, if an unscheduled bone marrow examination is performed, an aspirate 
specimen must be sent to both the local and central laborator ies for assessment, and results of the 
local hematology  will be collected.  
Monitoring for  the presence of hypokalemia should be performed at least 3 times per week 
during the Induction Phase  and treatment instituted to maintain potassium within normal limits.  
Subjects should also be monitored for the presence of concomitant hypom agnesemia and 
hypocalcemia (per institution’s normal ranges) and corrected if clinically indicated.  See 
Section  5.6.1.1  for further details.  The r esults are to be submitted to the central laboratory . 
Response will be assessed based on the local laboratory results using the response criteria in 
Table  17.15. 
6.2.1.1.  Cycle 1  
For the purpose of the study procedures and the schedule of events, Day 1 is defined as the first 
day of the first cycle of administration of induction chemotherapy . 
Refer to the schedule of events for list of assessments and procedures t o be performed in Cycle 1 
of Induction ( Table  17.1). 
Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized on Day 7.  If necessary, Randomization  may be performed later 
(eg, Days  8 to 10) to allow time for addressing electrolyte abnormalities, QTcF prolongation, etc.  
The i nvestigator will contact the IXRS to randomize the subject and to assign 
quizartinib/placebo.   
Subjects must be diagnosed as FL T3-ITD (+) in order to be randomized.  Subjects will be 
randomized based on the FLT3 -ITD central laboratory result, unless the FLT3 -ITD central 
laboratory result is not available by Day 8, in which case the subjects may be randomized based 
on the FLT3 -ITD local laboratory result.  However, in all cases a bone marrow aspirate specimen 
(or blood sample taken before start of chemotherapy treatment if bone marrow aspirate specimen 
not available) must be sent for central determination of FLT3 -ITD status.  
In the cases where subjects have been randomized and the FLT3 -ITD local and central laboratory 
results are discordant, the subjects will continue with quizartinib/placebo dosing.  
6.2.1.1.1.  Cycle 1, Day 7 (Window of Day s 7 to 10)  
 Once FLT3 -ITD (+) confirmed, explain all stu dy procedures, risks, and benefits to the 
subject; review the Main Study ICF with the subject; this may be done sooner than 
Day 7; answer all of the subject’s questions; have the subject sign and date the most 
current approved version of the ICF.  Subjects  must receive a copy of their ICF;

Subjects with ≥5% blasts, per the final bone marrow in Cycle 1 (local laboratory results), may 
receive a second cycle of induction chemotherapy , if considered appr opriate in the judgment of 
the investigator (reason for not administering a second cycle should be documented).  
Assessments and procedures for Cycle 2 Day 1 do not need to be repeated if they were done for 
Cycle 1 within the prior 7 days.  Refer to the schedule of events for the list of  assessments and 
procedures to be performed in Cycle 2 of Induction ( Table  17.2 and Table  17.3). 
It is recommended to wait at least 7 days after the last dose of quizartinib/placebo in Cycle 1 of 
Induction before starting Cycle 2 of Induction, since quizartinib has a long elimination half -life 
and the re are no data on the safety of administering anthracycline within 7 days following 
quizartinib administration.

Consolidation Phase  or, if certain criteria are met (see below), within  the first 3 months of the 
Continuation Phase .  Refer to the schedule of events for the list of assessments and procedures to 
be performed after allogeneic HSCT ( Table  17.5). 
Quizartinib/placebo should be discontinued at least 7 days before the start of a conditioning 
regimen.  
Following the allogeneic HSCT, the investigator will collect the following information from  the 
transplant unit:  
 Karnofsky performance status prior to the start of the conditioning regimen;  
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 103  All conditioning regimens the subject has received;  
 The date and type of transplant the subject has rece ived;  
 The type of donor . 
Addition ally, from the time of allogeneic HSCT up through the end of the allogeneic HSCT 
period (up to 180  days after the date of transplant), the investigator will collect the following 
information from the transplant unit every 4 weeks:  
 Determine if the subject has experienced a relapse, based on the available bone 
marrow aspirate and/or biopsy pathology report.  Collect a copy  of de-identified  local 
pathology report from the bone marrow aspirate for submission to IRC; 
 Review and  document the development of acute and chronic GVHD;  
 Record all engraftment failures;  
 Record all transplant related mortality and death for any reason.  
In addition to the above every 4-week follow -up for GVHD following the allogeneic HSCT, 
additional info rmation regarding  GVHD  (Table  17.16, Table  17.17 and Table  17.18), will be 
collected at the following post -HSCT timepoints: Day 100, 6  months  (± 3 months ), 12 months  
(± 3 months) , 18 months  (± 3 months) , and 2 4 months  (- 3/+ 6 months) .43,44  
Once th e subject is able, the subject will return to the clinic for site visits every 4 weeks (see 
Section  6.2.2.2.1 ). 
A subject  is permitted to undergo allogeneic HSCT for consolidation after the start  of the 
Continuation Phase if the following criteria are met:  
 When the subject starts the Consolidation Ph ase, the plan is for the subject to undergo 
HSCT as part of consolidation therapy;  
 A donor is not able to be found during the Consolidation Phase but becomes available 
after the start of the Continuation Phase;  
 The investigator discusses th e case with the  Medical Monitor;  
 Confirmed <5% of blasts based on the most recent bone marrow aspirate, based on 
the local laboratory results;  
 The transplant is performed within 3 months after Day 1 of continuation therapy.  
For subjects who have an allogeneic HSCT for co nsolidation within the first 3 months of 
continuation therapy, subjects restart therapy at the cycle they should hav e been in, had they not 
stopped;  eg, if the subject stopped at end of Cycle 2, and were ready to resume therapy 12 weeks 
later (with 28 days  per cycle), then the restart cycle would be Cycle 3. 
Any HSCT  performed for other reasons, e g, molecular relapse, will be considered 
nonprotocol -specified AML therapy, and the subject will be discontinued from 
quizartinib/placebo but will continue to be f ollowed for outcome data . 
Subjects are not permitted to undergo autologous  HSCT at any time during the study.  Subjects 
who undergo autologous HSCT will be discontinued from quizartinib/placebo but will continue

The following activities will ta ke place during these visits:  
 Collect and send blood samples to the laboratory for the following tests 
(Table  17.19): 
 Hematology (verify peripheral sme ar is not abnormal and cytopenias do not 
develop);  
 If peripheral smear is abnormal or cytopenias develop, per hematology results, then 
collect a bone marrow aspirate specimen and send to both the local and central 
laboratories for assessment of morphology;  if an adequate aspirate specimen cannot 
be collected, a core biopsy specimen will be collected and sent to  both the local and 
central laboratories;  
 Collect a copy  of de-identified  local pathology report for submission to IRC; 
 Evaluate if the subject is eligible for the Continuation  Phase;  
 Assess the subject for relapse based on the local laboratory results (see Section  7.2);

received since the subject resumed study visits;  
The following will take place every 12 weeks:  
 Collect a bon e marrow aspirate for laboratory analysis and send to  both the local and 
central laboratories for assessment of morphology; if an adequate aspirate specimen 
cannot be collected, a core biopsy specimen will be collected and sent to both the 
local and centra l laboratories

Page 106 examination is performed, an aspirate specimen will be sent to both the local and central 
laboratories for assessment and a blood sample should be obtained for local hematology.  
At any time during the Continuation  Phase, if relapse is suspected based on abnormal peripheral 
smears or development of cytopenias, collect a bone marrow aspirate specimen for laboratory 
analysis and document results; if an adequate aspirate s pecimen cannot be collected, a core 
biopsy specimen will be collected.  If a bone marrow aspirate specimen cannot be collected, then 
peripheral blood phenotyping should be performed to confirm that blasts are leukemic.  
Follow -up hematology should be perfo rmed after phenotyping.

7.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is OS.   
Overall survival is defined as the time from Randomization until death from any cause.  Subjects 
alive or lost to follow -up at the time of analysis will be considered censored at the date when 
they were  last known to be alive . 
7.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s 
Secondary efficacy endpoints (ie, secondary outcome measures ) are: 
 Event -free survival , which  is defined as the time from Randomization until the date of 
the earliest of any of the following  (refer to Table  17.15 for definition of response):  
 Refractory disease (or treatment failure) is determined at the end of the Induction 
Phase and defined as:  
o CR or CRi never achieved in the Induction Phase; or  
o Blasts 5% if Auer -rod positive; or  
o Appearance of new or worsening extramedullary disease;  
o For refractory disease, the EFS event date will be set to Day 1 at  
Randomization  
 Relapse after CR or CRi , which is defined as : 
o ≥5% blasts in the bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy not attributable to any 
other cause; or  
o Reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood; and/or  
o New appearance of extramedullary leukemia; or  
o Presence of Auer rods  
 Death from any cause at any ti me during the study.  
 Composite CR rate which is the percentage of subjects achieving CR or CRi  after 
Induction;  
 Percentage of subjects achieving CRc with FLT3 -ITD MRD negativity below a 
certain cutoff after Induction.  Minimal or measurable residual diseas e is the presence 
of a small number of leukemic cells in the bone marrow of patients with AML below 
the level of detection using conventional morphologic assessment. The FLT3 -ITD 
MRD assay by Next Generation Sequencing will be used to detect and quantify 
residual FLT3 -ITD mutations ; 
 Complete remission rate , which is the percentage of subjects achieving CR after 
Induction;

7.3. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints are: 
 Relapse -free survival (RFS) is the time from  randomization, for subjects who achieve  
CR or CR i in the Induction Phase , until documented relapse or death from any cause , 
whichever comes first .  Subjects alive without relapse or lost to follow -up at the time 
of analysis will be considered censored at the date of their last response/relapse 
assessment;  
 Duration of CR is the time from the first documented CR until documented relapse  or 
death from a ny cause , whichever comes first .  Subjects alive without relapse  or lost to 
follow -up as of the time of analysis will be censored at the date of their last 
response/relapse assessment;  
 Complete remission rate at the end of the first Induction cycle is the percentage of 
subjects who achieved CR after 1 Cycle of Induction;  
 Composite CR rate at the end of the first Induction cycle is the percentage of subjects 
whose best response is CR or CRi  at the end of first Induction cycle;  
 CRh rate is the percentage of subjects achieving CRh after Induction (only for IRC 
assessment of response);  
 MLFS rate is the percentage of subjects achieving MLFS after Induction (only for 
IRC assessment of response);  
 RFS in subjects who enter the Continuation  Phase  is the time from  randomization, for 
subjects who achieve  CR or CR i in the Induction Phase , until relapse or death from 
any cause , whichever comes first ; 
 Transplantation rate is the percent age of subjects undergoing allogeneic HSCT 
directly following protocol treatment with no intervening AML therapy (excluding 
conditioning regimens);  
 Subject reported QoL and symptoms as assessed with the EORTC QLQ -C30 
Questionnaire ; 
 General health status asses sed using EuroQol (EQ -5D-5L) Questionnaire;  
 Healthcare resource utilization.  
7.4. Appropriateness of Selected Efficacy Endpoints  
The initial goal of therapy for AML is to achieve a CR, given that a CR with currently available 
therapy is requisite, although not sufficient, for a cure.  Complete remission is the most important 
initial response reported in Phase 3 trials because it is the sole outcome currently associated with 
improved survival.  The goal of treatment in AML is to reduce the blasts in the bone marr ow to 
below 5% (CR) and return the blood cell counts to normal levels.

Version 7.0, 26 May 2021

Page 120 After chemotherapy, some patients fulfill all of the criteria for CR except for residual 
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia (CRi).  The outcome for these patients does not seem to be 
compa rable to that of patients with normalization of all counts, especially for those patients 
during initial therapy for their AML.  This category of response indicates activity of the 
investigational agent.  Patients in CRi might be considered for the transpl ant.45 
Improvement in EFS has been shown to correlate with increased OS in newly -diagnosed AML 
patients undergoing induction treatment and for AML pati ents in remission with maintenance  
therapy.  Data from the ECOG E1900 trial, presented at the 2014 American Society of 
Hematology meeting, showed concordance between EFS and OS.46  This randomized, Phase 3 
trial enrolled 657 subjects, 16 to 60 years old, with newly –diagnosed AML.  Subjects were 
randomized to receive daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 or 90  mg/m2 in combination with  cytarabine 
followed by consolidation therapy.  
An increase in EFS, which comprises an increased rate of remission, an increased duration of 
remission, or a reduction in early deaths or deaths during remission, is a benefit.  Therefore, EFS 
represents a cl inically relevant end point because relapse or treatment failure in AML signifies a 
reduced quality of life and substantial morbidity or mortality resulting either from the use of 
toxic salvage therapies, progressive disease, or both.  For patients with AM L who achieve CR 
after induction and consolidation therapy, delaying or preventing relapse is critical to long -term 
survival or cure.47 
Overall survi val is precise and easy to measure.  Demonstration of a statistically significant 
improvement in OS can be considered to be clinically significant if the toxicity profile is 
acceptable.  Difficulties in performing and analyzing survival studies include lon g follow -up 
periods in large trials and subsequent cancer therapy potentially confounding survival analysis.48 
Health -related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment in cancer research has become critical to fully 
evaluate overall treatment effectiveness by also formally including the patient’s perspective as an 
important objective.  
The assessment of patient -reported outcomes (PROs), including HRQoL has become critical to 
fully evaluate overall treatment effectiveness through incorporation of the patient’s perspective.  
Major cancer societies have been supporting its use as a key outcome for more than 2 decades.  
Acute leukemia patients experience sig nificant symptom burden and detrimental impact on 
domains of HRQoL, including physical and emotional well -being, especially in the early course 
of disease.  Intensive therapy may also detrimentally affect PROs.  Fatigue is a particularly 
intense symptom an d is significantly inversely correlated with physical and emotional 
functioning.45,49, 50, 51 Accordingly, patient reported symptoms and HRQoL are assessments of 
clinical be nefit in acute leukemia.52 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ -C30 is a questionnaire 
developed to assess the QoL of canc er patients, which has been widely used in cancer (including 
leukemia) clinical trials.53  It incorporates five functional scales (physical, role, co gnitive, 
emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting), a number 
of single items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients 
(constipation, diarrhea, sleep and dyspnea), perceived financial imp act of the disease and a 
global health status/QoL scale.

An IRC (Section  15.10 ) will independent ly review the following events in a blinded manner and 
without any knowledge of the subject’s randomized treatment assignment:  
 During  the Induction Phase , the IRC will indepe ndently assess the response for each 
bone marrow aspirate (or biopsy, if applicable ) sample collected , regardless of 
whether it is the first or second cycle.  If no blood counts are available on the day of 
the bone marrow specimen collection or if blood co unts have not recovered on the 
day of the bone marrow specimen collection , blood counts within ±  14 days of the 
bone marrow specimen collection  will be used to assess response.  
 During the post -Induction Phase s the IRC will independently review data to assess for 
relapse . 
Details about the definitions of the endpoints and IRC processes will be described in the IRC 
charter.

In this study, biomarker analyses will be used to investigate the effect of quizartinib at the 
molecular and cellular level as well as to determine how changes in the markers may relate to 
exposure and clinical outcomes.  The required sample collection information should be recorded 
on the electronic case report form  (eCRF ) page(s) and central laboratory requisition form(s).  
Detailed instructions for the collection, handling, and shipping of biomarker samples are outlined 
in the study laboratory manual . 
 FLT3 -ITD MRD by next generation sequencing  will be used to detect and quantify 
residual FLT3 ITD mutations .  (Results will not be available until the end of the 
study .) 
For subjects who are in CR or CRi, bone marrow samples from the following visits 
will be analyzed for FLT3 -ITD MRD: Screening; End of Induction; Consolidation 
Last Cycle; Post –HSCT; Continuation  Cycle 1, Day 1; Continuation  Cycle 4, Day 1; 
and EOT (ie, completion of 36 cycles  of continuation  therapy or early permanent 
discontinuation of quizartinib/placebo).  
 Mutati ons in the kinase and juxtamembrane domains of FLT3 and other somatic 
mutations known to be associated with AML or myeloid diseases (eg, CEBPA, 
DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, Kit, NPM1 and NRAS), determined with bone marrow or 
whole blood samples.  
Bone marrow samples  from the following visits will be analyzed for somatic 
mutations: Screening; Continuation  Cycle 4, Day 1; and at the time of relapse (as 
defined in Section  7.2). 
 Pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be analyzed with the intent of monitoring the 
anti-tumor impact of treatment with quizartinib.  The following candidate 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers are currently envisaged (other pharmacodynamic 
biomarkers in addition to or in place of these may be considered as suggested by 
updated literature):  FLT ligand; allelic ratio of FLT3 -ITD; and  flow cytometer 
analysis by using CD33, CD34, CD38 , or any other AML or blood cell markers.  
These pharmacodynamic biomarkers  will be assessed in bone marrow , blood , RNA, 
or DNA  that is left over from samples collected for other tests as described in 
Table  17.1, Table  17.2, Table  17.3, and Table  17.4 using validated assays.  One or 
more of the aforementioned pharmacodynamic biomarkers may also be explored for 
predictive value.

 During the study, in addition to the biomarkers specified above, explorato ry research 
may be conducted on any tumor sample.  These studies would extend the search for 
other potential biomarkers relevant to the effects of quizartinib, cancer and/or the 
resistance to treatment.  This may include the development of ways to detect, 
monitor , or treat cancer.  These additional investigations would be dependent upon 
clinical outcome, reagent, and sample availability.  
If the subject agrees, the remaining biomarker samples (bone marrow, blood, or other 
specimens obtained during the study)  may be stored for up to 15 years and further 
analyzed to address scientific questions related to quizartinib and/or AML.  
These assessments will be performed as described in Section 6, Table  17.1, Table  17.2,

8.5.1.  Genomic or Genetic Analysis  
Blood and epithelial oral cell samples will be collected for pharmacogenetic sample banking 
from subjects who have provided a separate informed consent for this part of the study.  
Participation in this part of the study is optional for all subjects.  For those subjects who choose 
to participate, samples will be banked for possible future pharmacogenetic and DNA analysis.  
These samples may be analyzed only for genes suspected to contribute to the safety and efficacy 
of the study medications.  
Samples will be retained until the genetic material has been exhausted or until the Sponsor 
instructs the genotyping contractor to destroy t he sample (in accordance with laboratory 
procedures).  During the period of storage, the genetic samples will not be immortalized or sold 
to anyone.  Subjects will have the right to withdraw consent and have their sample destroyed at 
any time.

9.1. Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
From the initial ICF (FLT3 -ITD Screening or Main Study) being signed and up to 
Randomization (Induction phase, Cycle 1 Day 7), all SAEs considered rela ted to study 
procedures by the i nvestigator will be recorded.  For randomized subjects, AEs and SAEs 
occurring between Induction Phase Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 6 will be recorded retrospectively.  
From  Randomization and up to the 30 -Day Safety Follow -up Visit, all AEs  (see Section  9.3.1  for 
definitions) observed by the i nvestigator or reported by the subject will be recorded, except 
during allogeneic HSCT (see Section  6.2.2.2 ).  Medical conditions (including clinically 
significant laboratory values/vital signs that are out of range) that were diagnosed or known to 
exist prior to initial ICF will be recorded as part of m edical history.  For subjects who undergo 
allogeneic HSCT, medical conditions (including clinically significant laboratory values/vital 
signs that are out of range) that were diagnosed or that occurred after allogeneic HSCT will be 
recorded as post -HSCT me dical history.  Any AEs that are unresolved at the time of transitioning 
to conditioning regimen for allogeneic HSCT should be followed up when the subject returns for 
Post-HSCT Visit (see Section  6.2.2.2.1 ). 
All AEs, SAEs , and events of special interest  are to be reported according to the procedures in 
Section  9.4. 
All laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG result s or findings  should be appraised by the 
investigator to determine their clinical significance.   Isolated abnormal laboratory results, vital 
sign findings, or ECG findings (ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be reported as AEs if 
they are symptomatic, lead to quizartinib/placebo discontinuation,  dose reduction,  require 
corrective treatment,  or constitute an AE in the i nvestigator’s  clinical judgment . 
At each visit, the i nvestigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by evaluating the 
subject.  Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the subject or by 
questioning the subject at each study visit.  Subjects should be questioned in a general way, 
without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms.  The i nvestigator must assess all 
AEs to determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance w ith the definitions in 
Section  9.3.  The i nvestigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the Study Center’s  
source documentation with the i nvestigator’s signature.  
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term.  When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available.  If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest 
a common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of AE or SAE.  
For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the SAE (diagnosis or sympt om requiring hospitalization).  A procedure is not an AE or SAE, 
but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE.  Pre -planned (prior to signing the ICF) 
procedure s or treatment s requiring hospitalization for pre -existing conditions that do not worsen  
in severity should not be reported as SAEs (see Section  9.3.2  for Definitions).  
Refractory disease and relapse (see Section  7.2 for criteria) are study endpoints and 
consequently, refractory disease, relapse, or worsening of AML should not be reported as an

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 127 AE/SAE.  Howeve r, clinical events associated with refractory disease/relapse and its sequelae 
resulting in a serious outcome should be reported as AEs or SAEs.  For deaths, the underlying or 
immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.  
Any serious, untoward event that may occur subsequent to  the reporting period that the 
investigator assesses as related to quizartinib/placebo should also be reported and managed as an 
SAE.  
The investigator should follow subjects with AEs until the event has resolved o r the condition 
has stabilized.  In case of unresolved AEs, including significant abnormal laboratory values at 
the end of study assessment, these events will be followed until resolution or until they become 
clinically not relevant.  
9.2. Events of Special Inte rest 
9.2.1.  QTc Prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, and Other Ventricular Arrhythmias  
Subjects who experience >480 ms QTcF prolongation and undergo dose interruption and/or 
reduction must be monitored closely with ECGs, performed twice weekly for the first week of  
the QTcF prolongation and then weekly thereafter until the QTcF prolongation is resolved, as 
described in Section  5.6.1.1 . 
QTcF prolongation ≥ Grad e 3, either serious or non -serious and whether or not causally related, 
must be recorded as AE or SAE in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system within 24 hours of 
awareness of the central EC G laboratory reading, with the i nvestigator’s assessment of 
seriousness, causality, and a detailed narrative.54  The central ECG reading confirming QTcF 
prolongation ≥ G rade 3 is to be recorded in the EDC system . 
9.2.2.  Combined Elevations of Aminotransferases and Bilirubin  
Combined elevations of aminotransfe rases and bilirubin, either serious or non -serious and 
whether or not causally related, meeting the laboratory criteria of a potential Hy’s Law case 
[ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN with simultaneous TBL ≥2 × ULN] should always be recorded as an 
AE or SAE within 2 4 hours of awareness, with the i nvestigator’s assessment of seriousness, 
causality, and a detailed narrative.55 
Subjects will be monitored as described in  Section  5.6.2.1.1 . 
9.3. Adverse Event  
9.3.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product  
and that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for 
example), symptom, or disease temporally associated wit h the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.56 
It is the responsibility of i nvestigators, based on t heir knowledge and experience, to determine 
those circumstances or abnormal lab oratory  findings which should be considered AEs .

Page 128 9.3.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is a ny untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening,  
 Requires  inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Is an important medical event.  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more.56 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeop ardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  Examples include 
allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias or development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
Note:  
 Procedure s are not AE s or SAE s, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or 
SAE.  
 Pre-planned (prior to signing the ICF) procedures or treatment s requiring 
hospitalizations for pre -existing conditions that do not worsen in severity are not 
SAEs.  
9.3.3.  Severity Assessmen t 
All AEs will be graded (1 to 5; see below) according to the latest NCI CTCAE:54  
 Grade 1 Mild AE  
 Grade 2 Moderate AE  
 Grade 3 Severe AE  
 Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5 Death related to AE  
Severity versus  Seriousness:  Severity i s used to describe the intensity of a specific event while 
the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe 
headache).  This is not the same as "seriousness," which is based on patient/event outcome at the 
time of the event.  For example, the NCI CTCAE Grade 4 (life -threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated) is assessed based on unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE, 
and these criteria may be different from those used for the assessment of AE seriousness.  An AE

Page 129 assessed as grade 4 based on the NCI CTCAE grades may or may not be assessed as serious 
based on the seriousness criteria.  
9.3.4.  Causality Assessment  
The causal relationship to an AE/SAE will be assessed with consideration to quizartini b/placebo 
on the basis  of the i nvestigator’s  judgment and the following definitions.  For SAEs only, the 
causal relationship to cytarabine and daunorubicin, if applicable, will also be assessed.  The 
causality assessment must  be made based on the available information and can be updated as 
new information becomes available.  
 Related:  
 The AE /SAE  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from quizartinib/placebo  
administration  (or for SAEs only, from cytarabine or daunorubicin admin istration)  
and cannot be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications).  
or 
 The AE /SAE  follows a reasonable temporal sequence from quizartinib/placebo  
admini stration  (or for SAEs only, from cytarabine or daunorubicin 
administration) , and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its chemical 
group, or is predicted by known pharmacology.  
 Not Related:  
 The AE /SAE  does not follow a reasonable sequence from quizartinib/placebo 
administration  (or for SAEs only, from cytarabine or daunorubicin 
administration) , or can be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or 
other factors (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant 
medications) . 
9.3.5.  Action Taken Regarding Study Drug (s) 
 Dose Not Changed: No change in quizartinib/placebo dosage was made.  
 Drug Withdrawn: The quizartinib/placebo was permanently stopped.  
 Dose Reduced: The dosage of quizartinib/placebo was reduced.  
 Drug Interrupted: The quizartinib/placebo was temporarily stopped.  
 Dose Increased: The dosage of quizartinib/placebo was increased.  
 Not Applicable: Subject died, quizartinib/placebo had been completed prior to 
reaction/event, or reaction/event occurred prior to start of treatme nt. 
9.3.6.  Other Action Taken for Event  
 None.  
 No treatment was required.

Page 130  Medication required.  
 Prescription and/or over-the-counter  medication was required to treat the AE.  
 Other.  
9.3.7.  Adverse Event Outcome  
 Recovered/Resolved  
 The subject fully recovered from the AE with no residual effect observed.  
 Recovering/Resolving  
 The AE improved but has not fully resolved.  
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
 The AE itself is still present and observable.  
 Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
 The residual effects of the AE are still present a nd observable.  
 Include sequelae/residual effects.  
 Fatal  
 Fatal should be used when death is a direct outcome of the AE.  
 Unknown  
9.4. Safety Reporting –Procedure For Investigators  
All AEs, including SAEs and Events of Special Interest, will be reported in the EDC.  
The following types of ev ents should be reported by the i nvestigator in EDC within 24 hours of 
awareness:  
 SAEs (see Section  9.3.2  for definitio n) 
 QTcF prolongation ≥ Grade 3, either serious or non -serious and whether or not 
causally related (see Section 5.6.1  for additional monitoring detai ls) 
 Hepatic events meeting combination abnormalities [ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN with 
simultaneous TBL ≥2 × ULN] (potential Hy's Law case), both serious and 
non-serious and whether or not causally related (see Section  5.6.2.1  for additional 
monitoring details)  
All events (serious and non -serious) must be reported with investigator’s assessment of the 
event’s seriousness, severity, and causality to the quizartinib/placebo.  Serious eve nts also must 
be reported with i nvestigator’s assessment of causality to cytarabine and daunorubicin, if 
applicable.  A detailed narrative summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, 
treatment, and outcome should be provided.  Specific or estimated dates of event onset, 
treatment, and resolution should be included when available.  Medical history, concomitant 
medications, a nd laboratory data that are relevant to the event should also be summarized in the 
Protocol AC220 -A-U302  
Version 7.0, 26 May 2021 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 131 narrative.  For fatal events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be 
performed, and include the results if available.  Source documents (including medi cal reports) 
will be retained at the study center and should not be submitted to the Sponsor for SAE reporting 
purposes.  
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed promptly.  Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries shou ld be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up. 
See study reference materials  for contact information for SAE reporting.  Please call the local 
SAE Hotline (see Study Manual) or your study monitor for any ques tions on SAE reporting.  
9.5. Notifying Regulatory Authorities, Investigators, and Institutional 
Review Board /Ethics Committee  
Daiichi Sankyo and/or CRO will inform investigators and regulatory authorities of any 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S USARs) occurring in other study centers or 
other studies of the investigational drug, as appropriate per local reporting requirements.  Daiichi 
Sankyo and/or CRO  will comply with any additional local safety reporting requirements.  
In the US, upon receipt o f the Sponsor’s notification of SUSARs that occurred with the 
quizartinib/placebo, unless delegate d to Daiichi Sankyo, it is the i nvestigator’s responsibility to 
inform the IRB per Sponsor’s instruction.  
In the European Economic Area states, it is the Spon sor’s responsibility to report SUSA Rs to all 
Central ECs, and the i nvestigator’s responsibility to inform the local EC.  
9.6. Exposure In Utero During Clinical Studies  
Women of childbearing potential (as defined in Section  4.1.1 ) must have negative urine or serum 
pregnancy test results at times specified in the Schedule of Events (Appendix  17.1).  If required 
by local regulations, additional pregnancy testing will be performed.  Follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) may be determined as n ecessary to confirm postmenopausal status.  Serum 
pregnancy tests and FSH will be performed at the local laboratory . 
Daiichi Sankyo must be notified of any subject who becomes pregnant while receiving or within  
6 months of discontinuing the quizartinib/pla cebo . 
Although pregnancy is not technically an AE, all pregnancies must be followed to conclusion to 
determine their outcome.  This information is important for both drug safety and public health 
concerns.  I t is the responsibility of the i nvestigator, or designee, to report any pregnancy in a 
female subject using the Exposure In Utero (EIU) Reporting form.  Please contact your study 
monitor to receive the EIU Reporting Form upon  learning of a pregnancy.  The i nvestigator 
should make every effort to follow the subject  until completion of the pregnancy and complete 
the EIU Reporting Form with complete pregnancy outcome information, including normal 
delivery and induced abortion.  The adverse pregnancy outcome, either serious or non -serious, 
should be reported  in accordance with study procedures.   If the outcome of the pregnancy meets 
the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (ie, post -partum complications, spontaneous or 
induced abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, including that in an aborted 
fetus), the i nvestigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs outlined in Section 9.4.

Page 132 9.7. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory determinations for hematology, blood chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis 
will be analyzed.  See Table  17.19 for specific analytes.  
9.8. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body 
temperature will be determined and recorded at the time s specified in the study schedule 
(Appendix  17.1). 
9.9. Electrocardiograms  
Supine triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be obtained at the times specified in the Schedule of Events 
(Appendix  17.5.2 ).  Addition al ECGs may be obtained at the i nvestigator’s discretion.  If an 
ECG is abnormal then a repeat triplic ate ECG must be performed.  
See Section  5.6.1.1  for management of subjects with QTc prolongation.  See Section  5.6.4 , 
Section  5.8.3 , and Appendix  17.5.1  for ECG monitoring requirements for subject receiving a 
concomi tant drug that prolongs QTc or is a CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
9.10. Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination will be performed at Screening and at additional times 
specified in the Schedule of Events (Appendix  17.1).  Whenever possible, the same individual 
will perform subsequent examinations to identify changes from baseline.  Clinically significant 
changes from baseline must be reported as AEs.  
Sympto m-directed physical examinations performed during the treatment period will be based on 
the subject’s medical history and AEs, and will include weight determination and a review of 
body systems.  During the Continuation  Phase , this will also include an eva luation of signs and 
symptoms of relapse.

Page 133 10. OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
10.1. Health Economics and Outcome Research  
10.1.1.  Patient -Reported Outcomes  
Patient -reported outcomes will be assessed using EORTC QLQ –C30 (Appendix  17.13 ) and 
EQ-5D-5L (Appendix  17.14 ). 
 EORTC  QLQ –C30 
 EORTC QLQ -C30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, 
emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and 
vomiting), a number of single items assessing additional symptoms commonly 
reported by cancer pa tients (constipation, diarrhea, sleep,  and dyspnea), perceived 
financial impact of the disease and a global health status/QoL scale.  All scores 
are scaled from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better QoL and fewer 
symptoms.53 
 The QLQ -C30 is the most widely used questionnaire for cancer (including 
leukemia) patients in clinical trials in Europe, and is also used extensively in 
America and throughout the rest of the world.53  The psychometric properties of 
the QLQ -C30 have been well established and the questionnaire was found to 
possess  the required standards such as validity (measuring what it is intended to 
measure), reliability (measuring with sufficient precision) and sensitivity (ability 
to detect changes).53  A 10 -point difference in a QLQ -C30 domain score is 
generally considered clinically important.57  It has been shown to be sensitive to 
change in patients undergoing cancer treatment (chemotherapy and/or 
radiotherapy).58 
 EQ-5D-5L 
 General health status will be assess ed using EQ -5D-5L.  The EQ -5D-5L is a 
6-item generic multi -attribute preference -based health status questionnaire that is 
easy to administer and takes only 1 to 2 minutes to complete.  The questionnaire 
will be used to generate study -specific data for the calculation of quality -adjusted 
life years for economic evaluation.  
 The EQ -5D-5L is in two parts.  The first part comprises five domains (mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each assessed by 
one item with 5 response options ranging from no problems through profound 
difficulties.  Accordingly, 3125 (5 ×5×5×5×5) pote ntial health profiles can be 
generated to which public preferences or utilities from published value sets are 
applied, ranging from negative values to 1 (perfect health).59  The second part of 
the EQ -5D-5L is a Visual Analogue Scale on which subjects rate their current 
health, with 0 representing the "worst health you can imagine" and 100 the "best 
health you can imagine."

EORTC  QLQ -C30 Analysis Set will include all subjects in the ITT Analysis Set who 
complete the rele vant EQ -5D-5L and EORTC QLQ -C30 assessment at Screening, at 
least partially in a manner that permits imputation of missing responses posttreatment.  
11.2. General Statistical Considerations  
The randomization  will be stratified by geographical region (North Americ a, Europe, and 
Asia/Other Regions), Age (<60 years old, ≥60 years old), and WBC count at the time of 
diagnosis of AML (<40×109/L, ≥40×109/L).  
Summary statistics will be presented by treatment group.  For continuous variables, number of 
available observati ons (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be 
provided.  For categorical variables, the number and percentage in each category will be 
displayed.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT Analysis Set and PPS.  Safety analyse s will be 
performed using the Safety Analysis Set.  All other efficacy exploratory analyses will be 
performed based on ITT Analysis Set and availability of assessment.  
The efficacy analyses will be performed according to the treatment groups assigned at 
Randomization .  For safety analyses, subjects will be analyzed according to actual treatment 
received.  
Assessments of change from baseline to post -baseline or the ratio of post -baseline to baseline 
will include only those subjects with both baseline and post -baseline measurements.  Baseline

purpose of data analysis.  
11.3. Study Population Data  
Subject disposition will be summarized by treatment group and in total for those defined selected  
Analysis Sets.  
The demographic and baseline characteristics such as baseline ECOG disease status will be 
summarized descriptively by treatment group for the ITT, PPS, and Safety Analysis Sets.  
Quizar tinib/placebo exposure (amount and duration), average daily dose and relative dose 
intensity  will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group for the Safety 
Analysis Set.  
Medical history will be coded using the latest Medical Dictionary f or Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version and summarized by system organ class, preferred term,  and presented by 
treatment group.  
11.4. Statistical Analysis  
11.4.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
11.4.1.1.  Primary Efficacy Analyses  
Overall survival  is the primary efficacy endpoint for this study  (see Section  7.1 for the definition 
of OS).   
The primary analysis for OS will be based on the ITT Analysis Set.  Comparison of distribution 
of OS between treatment groups will be made using a stratified log -rank test with the 3 
stratification factors used at randomization at a 2-sided 5% significance level.  The median OS 
will be calculated based on Kaplan -Meier estim ates and the corresponding 95% CI will be 
calculated using the  method provided by Brookmeyer and Crowley.60  In addition, the stratified 
Cox proporti onal hazards regression model will be performed to estimate  hazard ratio  (HR) 
along with the 2-sided 95% CI , and SAS PROC LIFETEST and PROC PHREQ will be used in 
the analysis .61 
11.4.1.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The analysis for EFS will be based on the ITT Analysis Set.  The distribution of EFS will be 
compared between the 2  treatment groups using a stratified log -rank test with the 3  stratification 
factors  used in randomization.  The distribution function of EFS will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method.  The median EFS along with the 2 -sided 95% CIs by Brookmeyer and 
Crowley will be presented by treatment group.60  The stratified Cox proportional hazards 
regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio of EFS, along with the 2-sided 
95% CI.   
EFS will be analyzed based on the response as sessment by the IRC .  EFS will also be analyzed 
based on the investigator’s response assessment as a sensitivity analysis.

Page 137 The CR  rate, rate of subjects achieving CR with FLT3 -ITD MRD negativity , CRc rate, and rate 
of subjects achieving CRc with FLT3 -ITD M RD negativity will be summarized along with 
95% CI using Clopper -Pearson’s method.62  Comparisons of CR  rate, rate of subjects achieving 
CR with FLT3 -ITD MRD negativity, CR c rate, and rate of subjects achieving CR c with 
FLT3 -ITD MRD negativity between treatment groups will be made using a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test with the 3 stratification factors used in randomization . 
To control for the family -wise type I error rate for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, 
a serial hierarchically ordered gatekeeping strategy will be employed.  The primary assessment 
of OS in the ITT Analysis Set will be evaluated first, and if significant at a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05, 
a statistical evaluation of EFS  by IRC , based on the EFS definition in the Guidance s,63,72 will be 
performed  in the ITT Analysis Set .  After EFS evaluation, the order of other secondary endpoints 
to be tested will be CR rate, rate of subjects achieving C R with FLT3 -ITD MRD negativit y, CRc 
rate, and rate of subjects achieving CR c with FLT3 -ITD MRD negativity.  Testing will stop once 
1 test in the sequence fails to be statistically significant.  
11.4.1.3.  Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
Relapse -Free Survival  will be analyzed  by treatment group usin g the Kaplan -Meier method  for 
subjects achieving CRc.  
RFS in subjects who enter the Continuation Phase will be summarized similarly as RFS.  
Duration of CR will be analyzed similarly as RFS. 
Rate of allogeneic HSCT, rate of CR at end of first Induction cycle, rate of CRc at end of first 
Induction cycle, rate of CRh after Induction (IRC evaluation only), and rate of MLFS after 
Induction (IRC evaluation only) will be summarized by treatment grou p with p oint estimate and 
associated 2 -sided 95% CI constructed using Clopper -Pearson’s method.62  
Confidence interval presented for exploratory endp oints are provided for summary purpose, not 
inference.

The f inal set of sensitivity  and supplementary  analyses will be selected and specified in the SAP.  
11.4.1.5.  Subgroup Analyses  
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints , OS and EFS,  will be also analyzed for the 
following subgroups in the ITT Analysis Set:  
 By region: North America, Europe, Asia/Other Regions;  
 By age: <60, 60 to 65, and ≥65 years old;  
 By WBC count at the time of diagnosis of AML (<40×109/L, ≥40×109/L);

11.4.2.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
11.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
For the PK -ECG -Biomarker Substudy: pharmacokinetic parameters of quizartinib and its 
metabolites (AC886) will be estimated for subjects who have sufficient plasma concentrations 
available.  Standard non -compartmental analysis will be estimated for subjects with sufficient 
intense PK data available for the following PK parameters: AUC 0-24, Cmax , Cmin , Tmax , and 
accumulation ratio and parent/metabolite ratio at Day 8 and Day 21 during Cycle 1 o f Induction.  
Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics by 
treatment group and by treatment phase when appropriate.  
Population PK analysis will be conducted to characterize the PK profiles of quizartinib and i ts 
metabolite (AC886) in the target patient population, including quantification of inter -individual 
variability and identification of pote ntial significant covariates (i e, patients demographics and 
clinical factors) that may affect the PK of quizartinib a nd its metabolite.  If necessary, PK data 
from this study will b e pooled with those from other P hase 1 and 2 studies for the population PK 
modeling.  
The potential relationships between quizartinib PK exposure versus QTcF or clinical response 
measures will  be explored by both graphical and modeling approaches.  
Details about the non -compartmental analysis, population PK modeling and exposure -response 
analysis will be provided in separate plans.  The population PK and exposure -response analysis 
results will b e reported separately.  In addition, population PK and pharmacodynamic analyses 
may be performed prior to database lock by a third party, unblinded pharmacometrician, who 
will be firewalled from the study team in accordance with the details provided in a s eparate 
document.  
11.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Number and percentage of subjects achieving full inhibition as measured by PIA will be 
summarized for each time point by treatment groups.  A subject is said to have achieved full 
inhibition at a certain PIA assessment visit if the corresponding PIA value is >90%.  Number and 
percentage of subjects achieving full inhibition will be provided for the quizartinib group.  
Summary statistics will be provided for the quizartinib group in the Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
Set. 
11.4.2.3.  Biomarker Analyses  
Number and percentage o f subjects expressing different AML associated mutations will be 
summarized by treatment group.  
FLT3 -ITD allelic ratio will be summarized and presented by treatment groups.

Page 139 11.4.3.  Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Analysis Set.  List ings will be based on the Safety  
Analysis Set.  
For each safety analys is, baseline will be defined in the SAP .  No inferential statistical analysis is 
planned for safety data, unless otherwise specified.  If the number of subjects with available data 
does not allow for the reliable estimation of variability at a scheduled time point, no summary 
statistics will be presented for that time point, unless otherwise indicated.  
11.4.3.1.  Adverse Event Analyses  
Adverse events to be included in summary tables will be restrict ed to TEAEs.  A TEAE is 
defined as an AE that occur, having been absent before first dose of quizartinib/placebo, or have 
worsened in severity after initiating quizartinib/placebo.  Safety analyses include frequency and 
severity of TEAEs.  
AEs collected mor e than 30 days after the last dose of quizartinib/placebo will not be considered 
TEAEs unless they are  considered drug -related.  If the relationship to drug is missing, the AE is 
considered drug -related.  
AEs will be coded using MedDRA (the latest version) and assigned grades based on NCI 
CTCAE, Version 4.03.  The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs will be 
tabulated by the worst CTCAE grade, system organ class, and preferred term, with a breakdown 
by treatment group.  Similarly, the number and  percentage of subjects reporting 
treatment -emergent SAEs will be tabulated by treatment group, as well as TEAEs/SAEs 
considered related to quizartinib/placebo and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
quizartinib/placebo, respectively.  
A by -subject AE (incl uding treatment emergent) data listing including, but not limited to, 
verbatim term, preferred term, system organ class, CTCAE grade, and relationship to 
quizartinib/placebo will be provided.  Deaths, other SAEs, AESIs and other significant AEs, 
including those leading to permanent discontinuation from quizartinib/placebo, will be listed.   
The AESIs will be re -evaluated periodically  and the final list of AESIs will be reflected in the 
final SAP . 
SAEs  and nonserious AESIs  will be reconciled between the clini cal and safety databases.  The 
clinical database will be used to summarize and list the SAEs.  
Subgroup analyses of AEs will be performed if applicable using subgroups defined in the SAP.  
11.4.3.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will b e provided for the clinical laboratory results and changes from 
baseline by scheduled time of evaluation and by treatment group including end of treatment visit 
as well as for the maximum and minimum post -baseline values.  
Abnormal clinical laboratory resul ts will be graded according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.03, if 
applicable.  A shift table, presenting by treatment group the 2 -way frequency tabulation for 
baseline and the worst post -baseline value according to the CTCAE grade, will be provided for

Page 141 11.5. Sample Size Determination  
The primary endpoint of the study is OS in the ITT Analysis Set. A log -rank test will be applied 
to test the treatment effect between the 2 treatment arms with a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05.  
For OS, a plateau effect was observed after 30 months of treatment in the control arm of  the 
Midostaurin RATIFY study.64  Therefore, a piecewise exponential model was considered to 
account for the plateau effect. Simulations were carried out to determine the sample siz e, timing 
of analysis, and power.   
In the RATIFY study, the landmark survival rates of 42% at 30 months and 38% at 60 months in 
FLT3 -ITD group were observed in the control arm.65  This translates into a hazard rate of 0.029 
in the first 30 months and 0.003 afterwards in the control arm.  Based on this information, the 
simulation assumes a hazard rate of 0.029 in the first 30  months (from the randomization) and 
0.003 afterwards in the placebo arm, and a HR of 0.7 and 1, respectively, before and after the 
first 30 months between the 2 treatment arms.  This is equivalent to an assume d survival rate of 
54% at 30 months and 50% at 60 months in the quizartinib arm.  
Simulations indicate that about 84% power and 287 events will be obtained to achieve a 
statistically significant difference in OS distribution with approximately 536 subjects by a 
2-sided log -rank test at the 0.05 signifi cance level when OS is analyzed at 24 months after the 
last subject is randomized.   
The OS analysis will be performed:  
 When the target 287 OS events are observed and a minimum of 24 months has 
elapsed since the last subject was randomized.  
 If the target 2 87 OS events are not achieved by 24 months since the last subject was 
randomized, then the analysis will be performed at a maximum of 30 months after the 
last subject is randomized.  
The sample size derivation is based on  the EAST Version 6.3  and simulation s were run using  
SAS® Version 9.2 .66 
11.6. Statistical Analysis Process  
The SAP will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and 
safety data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other clinical study 
information such as subject disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, 
quizartinib/placebo exposure, and prior and concomitant med ications.  The SAP will also include 
a description of how missing, unused, and spurious data will be addressed.  
The SAP will be finalized prior to un -blinding to preserve the integrity of the statistical analysis 
and clinical study conclusions.  
All statist ical analyses will be performed using SAS® Version 9.2 or higher (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC 27513).61

12.1. Monitoring a nd Inspections  
The CRO monitor and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible f or contacting and visiting 
the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the 
various records of the study (eg, eCRFs , source d ata, and other pertinent documents).  
The verification  of adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the 
data; and adherence to ICH  good clinical practice ( GCP) and local regulations on the conduct of 
clinical research will be acc omplished through a combination of onsite visits by the monitor and 
review of study data remotely.   The frequency of the monitoring visit will vary based on the 
activity at each Study Center.  The monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs and ensurin g 
completeness of the study essential documents.  The monitor should have access to subject 
medical records and other study -related records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.   
Detailed information is provided in the monitoring plan.  
The monitor wil l communicate deviations from the protocol, GCP and  applicable regulations to 
the investigator and will ensure that appropriate action  (s) designed to prevent recurrence of the 
detected deviations is taken and documented.  
The i nvestigator agrees to coopera te with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the 
course of these monitoring visits are addressed  to the satisfaction of the sponsor  and 
documented.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audi t 
by representatives from the Sponsor.  Audit  of Study Center facilities (eg, pharmacy, drug 
storage areas, laboratories) and review of study related records will occur in order to evaluate the 
study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and a pplicable regulatory 
requirements.   The i nvestigator should respond to audit findings.  In the event that a re gulatory 
authority informs the i nvestigator that it intends to conduct an inspection, the Sponsor shall be 
notified immediately.  
12.2. Data Collection  
The i nvestigator, sub -investigator, or study staff will enter the data in the eCRF.  
The eCRF completion should be kept current and will be completed, and/o r reviewed and 
e-signed by the i nvestigator.  
12.3. Data Management  
Each subject will be identified in the d atabase by a unique subject identifier as defined by the 
sponsor.  
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and Study Centers, a Clinical Data 
Management review will be performed on subject data according to specifications given to CRO.  
Data will be vetted both electronically and manually for eCRFs and the data will be 
electronically vetted by programmed data rules within the application.  Queries generated by 
rules and raised by reviewers will be generated and resolved within the EDC appl ication.  During

Investigators will maintain a confidential screening log of all potential study ca ndidates that 
includes limited information of the subjects, date,  and outcome of screening process.  
Investigators will be expected to maintain an Enrollment Log of all subjects enrolled in the study 
indicating their assigned study number.  
Investigators wil l maintain a confidential subject identification code list.  This confidential list of 
names of all subjects allocated to study numbers on enr olling in the study allows the i nvestigator 
to reveal the identity of any subject when necessary.  
Source documents  are original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s eCRF data 
are obtained.  These include but are not limited to hospital records, clinical and office charts, 
laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, X -rays, and correspondenc e. 
Records of subjects, source documents, monitoring visit logs, data correction forms, eCRFs, 
inventory of quizartinib/placebo, regulatory documents (eg, protocol and amendments, IRB/EC 
correspondence and approvals, approved and signed ICFs, Investigator’s Agreement, clinical 
supplies receipts, distribution and return records), and other sponsor correspondence pertaining 
to the study must be kept in appropriate study files at the Study Center  (Trial Master File).  
Source documents include all recordings and observations or notations of clinical activities and 
all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical study.  
These records will be retained in a secure file for the period required by the Study Center’ s 
policy.  Prior to transfer or destruction of these records, the Sponsor must be notified in writing 
and be given the opportunity to further store such records.  
12.5. Record Keeping

This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, the ICH consolidated Guideline E6 for GCP 
(CPMP/ICH/135/95), and applicable regulatory requirement(s) for the regions in which the study 
is being conducted.  
15.2. Subject Confidentiality  
The i nvestigators an d the Sponsor will preserve the confidentiality of all subjects taking part in 
the study, in accordance with GCP and local regulations.  
The i nvestigator must ensure that the subject’s anonymity is maintained.  On the eCRFs or other 
documents submitted to t he Sponsor or the CRO, subjects should be identified by a unique 
subject identifier as designated by the Sponsor.  Documents that are not for submission to the 
Sponsor or the CRO (eg, signed ICF) should be ke pt in strict confidence by the i nvestigator.  
In compliance with ICH GCP Guide lines, it is required that the i nvestigator and Study Center 
permit authorized representatives of the company, of the regulatory agency(s), and the IRB/EC 
direct access to review the subject’s original medical records for verif ication of study -related 
procedures and data.  The i nvestigator is obligated to inform the subject that his/her study -related 
records will be reviewed by the above named representatives without violating the 
confidentiality of the subject.  
15.3. Informed Consent   
Before a subject’s partici pation in the study, it is the i nvestigator’s responsibility to obtain freely 
given consent, in writing, from the subject after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific 
procedures are done or any quizartinib/placebo is administered.  Subjects should be given the 
opportunity to ask questions and receive satisfactory answers to their inquiries, and should have 
adequate time to decide whether  or not to participate in the study.  The written ICFs should be 
prepared in the local language(s) of the potential subject population.  
In obtaining and doc umenting informed consent, the i nvestigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement s, and should adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles that 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The ICF and any revision(s) should be approved 
by the EC or IRB prior to being provided to potential subjects.  
The subject’s written informed consent should be documented in the subject’s medical records.  
The ICFs should be signed and personally dated by the subject and by the person who conducted 
the informed consent d iscussion (not necessarily the i nvestigator).  The original signed ICFs 
shou ld be retained in accordance with Study Center policy, and a copy of the signed ICF should 
be provided to the subject.  The date that informed consent was given should be recorded.  
For studies in the US, an additional consent is required for the Health Ins urance Portability and 
Accountability Act.  Also, a separate special consent will be required for Pharmacogenomic 
testing for this protocol.

Page 148 15.4. Regulatory Compliance  
The study protocol, subject information,  and consent form, the IB, any subject written 
instructions to be given to the subject, available safety information, subject recruitment 
procedures (eg, advertisements), information about payments and compensation available to the 
subjects, an d documentat ion evidencing the i nvestigator’s qualifications should be submitted to 
the EC or IRB for ethical review and approval according to local regulations, prior to the study 
start.  The written approval should identify all documents reviewed by name and version . 
Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analysis will be documented in a protocol 
amendment and/or the SAP.  
The i nvestigator and/or CRO  must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the IEC or 
IRB for all subsequent protocol amendments  and changes to the ICFs.  The i nvestigator should 
notify the IEC or IRB of deviations from the protocol or SAEs occurring at the Study Center and 
other AE reports received from the Sponsor/CRO, in accordance with local procedures.  
As required by local regula tions, the Sponsor’s local Regulatory Affairs group or representative 
to whom this responsibility has been delegated will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval from the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to study initiation, and tha t 
implementation of changes to the initial protocol and other relevant study documents happen 
only after approval by the relevant regulatory bodies.  
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed (eg, clinical hold) by an applicable 
Regulatory Auth orities in an y area of the world, or if the i nvestigator is aware of any new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
drug, the Sponsor should be informed immediately.  
In addition, the i nvestigator w ill inform the Sponsor immediately of any urgent safety measures 
taken by the i nvestigator to protect the study subjects against any immediate hazard, and of any 
suspected/actual serio us GCP non -compliance that the i nvestigator becomes aware of.  
15.5. Protocol D eviations  
The i nvestigator should conduct the study in compliance with the protocol agreed to by Sponsor 
and, if required, by the regulatory authority(ies), and which was given approval/favorable 
opinion by the IRBs/IECs.  
A deviation to any protocol procedure or waiver to any stated criteria will not be allowed in this 
study except where necessary to eliminate immediate hazard(s) to the subject.  Sponsor must be 
notified of all intended or unintended deviations to the protocol (eg, inclusion/exclusion  criteria, 
dosing, missed study visits) on an expedited basis.  
The i nvestigato r, or person designated by the i nvestigator, should document and explain any 
deviation from the approved protocol.  
If a subject was ineligible or received the incorrect dose or quizartinib/placebo , and had at least 
1 administration of quizartinib/placebo , data should be collected for safety purposes.  
If applicable, t he investigator should notify the IEC/ IRB of deviations from the protocol in 
accordance with local procedures.

Page 149 15.6. Supp ly of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Stud y 
When new information becomes available that may adversely affect the safety of subjects or the 
conduct of the stud y, the Sponsor will inform all i nvestigators involved in the clinical study, 
IECs/IRB s, and regulatory authorities of such information, and when needed, will amend the 
protocol and/or subject information.  
The i nvestigator should immediately inform the subject whenever new information becomes 
available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent or may influence the subject’s willingness 
to continue participation in the study.  The communication should be documented on medical 
records, for example, and it should be confirmed whether the subject is willing to remain in the 
study.  
If the sub ject information is revised, it must be re -approved by the IEC/IRB.  The  investigator 
should obtain written informed consent to continue participation with the revised written 
information even if subjects were already informed of the relevant information.  The i nvestigator 
or other responsible personnel who provided explanations and the subject should sign and date 
the revised ICFs.  
15.7. Protocol Amendments  
Any amendments to the study protocol that seem to be appropriate as the study progress es will 
be communica ted to the i nvestigator by Daiichi Sankyo or the CRO.  Also, the Sponsor will 
ensure the timely submission of amendments to regulatory authorities.  
A global protocol amendment will affect study conduct at all study centers in all regions of the 
world.  Suc h amendments will be incorporated into a revised protocol document.  Changes made 
by such amendments will be documented in a Summary of Changes document.  These protocol 
amendments will undergo the same review and approval process as the original protocol.  
A local protocol amendment will affect study conduct at a particular Study Center(s) and/or in a 
particular region/country.  Sponsor approval of local amendments will be clearly documented.  
A protocol amendment may be implemented after it has been approve d by the IRB/EC and by 
regulatory authorities where appropriate, unless immediate implementation of the change is 
necessary for subject safety.  
15.8. Study Termination

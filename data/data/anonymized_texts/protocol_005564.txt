Study Protocol Synopsis 
 
JET-ISR trial  
Protocol Number  MCRF -S002 -2015  
Devices  JetStream Navitus XC 2.1 and 2.4  
Primary Purpose  The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that Jetstream atherectomy 
and adju nctive balloon angioplasty (JS +PTA) improves target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) at 6 months follow -up when compared to historic 
data from balloon angioplasty alone (PTA) in the treatment of 
femoropopliteal arterial In -stent restenotic (ISR) disease  
Study Design  A prospective, multicenter, single arm study evaluating the investigational 
use of Jetstream Atherectomy (JS)  and adjunctive balloon angioplasty (JS 
+PTA)  in the treatment of f emoropopliteal ISR lesions in subjects with 
claudication or limb isc hemia (Rutherfor d clinical category (RCC) of 2 -4) 
(lesion length ≥ 4 cm). The comparator arm is historic data from plain old 
balloon angioplasty derived from a Meta -analysis of the 3 published 
randomized trials in the field.   
Follow -Up 
Schedule  Follow -up assessments will occur at pre -discharge, 30 days, 6 months and 
1 year following the study procedure.   
Statistical 
assumption and 
analysis  Assumptions:  
 
TLR with bailout stenting from historic control from meta -analysis: 
 37.9%  
TLR with bailout stenting from Jetstream ISR feasibility study:  
 20.7%  
Power 80%  
Alpha 0.0 5 
 
We are planning a study of independent cases and controls with 1 
control(s) per case.  Prior data indicate that the failure rate among controls is 
0.38.  If the true failure rate for experi mental subjects is 0.21, we will need to 
study 112 experimental subjects and 112 control subjects to be able to reject 
the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control subjects 
are equal with probability (power) 0.8  (meta -analysis from published 
randomized trials provides data on 182 controls) .   The Type I error 
probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.  We will 
use an uncorrected chi -squared statistic to evaluate this null hypothesis.  
Assumingly a loss o f 20% of patients on follow -up a minimum of 134 
patients will be enrolled.  
 
Number of Sites  Up to 14 sites in the  USA

Outcomes  
 Effectiveness: Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) at 6 months : TLR 
is defined as retreatment of the index lesio n (extended 1 cm proximal and 
distal to the lesion) at 6 months. For the primary endpoint, intra -procedural 
bail out stenting of the index lesion is considered meeting a TLR endpoint. 
(ITT analysis)  
Safety : Major Adverse Events (MAE) at 30 days : unplanned amputation, 
total mortality or TLR at 30 days (TLR includes bail out stenting)  
DSMB  The study will be evaluated for safety after the first 60 patients enrolled. 
Stopping rule  will be based on freedom from MAE at 30 days that is > 78% 
(bailout stent in th e PTA control arm ranged from 7 to 20% in the 
randomized trial. Bailout stent is included as a MAE (part of the TLR 
definition). If maximum bailout stent occurs (20%), this allows a 2 % 
amputation/death rate within 1 month before the study is stopped i.e. total 
events of 22%, or freedom from events of 78%).

JETS T REAM XC ATHERECTOMY DE VICE  
 The Boston Scientific Jetstream XC catheter is a rotating, aspirating, expandable 
ca
theter for active removal of atherosclerotic disease and thrombus in peripheral 
vasculature. The JS XC System has been cleared by the FDA for use in the peripheral 
va
sculature to treat denovo and non-stent infrainguinal lesions 
 
 JETSTREAM XC™ device has 2 sets of blades: one set is at the tip of the catheter 
a
nd the other (5 blades) is mounted proximal to the tip. Counterclockwise rotation 
e
xpands the proximal blades and allows wider tissue cutting. The JetStream Navitus has 
be
en improved compared to its predecessor, the Pathway device, with the aspiration port 
plac
ed proximal to the blades instead of distally, allowing a more robust aspiration 
c
apacity. The recommended use of this device with tips and tricks on how to operate it 
c
an be found in prior publications.1,2 
 
 There are 2 cutter designs with the JETSTREAM device. The JETSTREAM® XC 
(or eXpandable Cutter Catheters) and the JETSTREAM® SC (or Single Cutter 
Catheters). The Expandable Cutter, as the name implies, can be used blades down (BD) 
a
nd blades up (BU) with single insertion and are for femoropopliteal vessels. The XC or 
Expandable Cutters Catheters come in 2 sizes: 2.1mm/3.0mm (135 cm length) is best 
suited for vessel size larger than 3.0 BD and 4.0-5.0 mm BU; and the 2.4mm/3.4mm (120 
cm length) is typically used for vessels 4.0-4.9mm BD and 5.0 mm or larger BU. Also, 
the SC or Single Cutter Catheters come in two sizes: 1.6 mm (145 cm length) best suited 
for vessel size 2.0-2.5 mm; and the 1.85 mm (145 cm shaft length) typically used for 
vessel sizes 2.6-3.0 mm. The single cutters have only have a front end cutter with no BU 
feature and typically are used for proximal and mid tibial and peroneal vessels. The 
device is retracted through the treatment area by “rexing” it until wire loop is back to its 
initial size.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
3.1 DISEASE OVERVIEW  
In 2001, in the United States alone, the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease 
(PAD) is estimated to be 8-12 million people.  Endovascular therapy has exponentially 
incr
eased over the past decade and is now applied in the majority of patients undergoing 
PAD treatment with revascularization. The tool box to treat infrainguinal PAD has 
expanded significantly and includes plain old balloon angioplasty (PTA), atherectomy, 
stenting, specialized balloons, drug coated balloons (DCB) and Drug coated stents 
(D
CS). In univariate analysis, PAD is more prevalent with age, men and Black 
population and less prevalent in Hispanic and Asians. Multivariate analysis continues to 
indicate that older age and Blacks are at a higher risk of PAD than the younger 
population or non-Hispanic Whites respectively even when adjusting for traditional risk 
factors such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking and history of coronary 
artery disease (2b). 
S
everal studies have shown that stenting of the femoropopliteal artery (FP) leads to 
higher long term patency. Bare metal stents have not shown conclusively to reduce target 
lesion revascularization (TLR) which is in contrast to DCB and DCS3,4,5,6.  Irrespective, 
stenting has several disadvantages including a continued high rate of restenosis and stent 
fractures that is progressive with time7,8. FP ISR occurs in more than one third of patients 
a
t 1 year and up to 49% at 2 years3-8. Complex lesions (long, Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society 
C
onsensus II C/D lesions, total occlusions), certain demographics (female gender, 
diabetes mellitus), critical limb ischemia and significant stent fractures are associated 
with a higher rate of restenosis9.  Also the majority of occluded stents are restenotic-
thrombot
ic and generally are more challenging to tr eat.  
3.2     Therapies in Treating FP ISR  
Several methods have been proposed to treat FP-ISR including plain old balloon 
angioplasty (PTA), cryoplasty (PolarCath, Boston Scientific, Natick, Mass) , cutting 
ba
lloons, drug-eluting self-expanding stents (Zilver X) (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, 
USA), rotational and aspiration atherectomy including the Rotarex S (Staub Medical AG, 
W
angs, Switzerland) and JetStream (Boston Scientific, Maple Grove, MN), directional 
atherectomy with SilverHawk (MDT, USA)), laser ablation (Excimer laser, 
S
pectranetics, Colorado Springs, Co, USA), Viabahn covered stents (W.L.Gore and 
Assoc
iates, Newark, DE) and DCB10-20.   
Early observational data attempted debulking of FP ISR to reduce restenotic tissue 
burden and theoretically delay or reduce the rate of repeat revascularization.  Silingardi et 
al21 reported their experience with the Rotarex S device in treating 32 patients with 
subacute or chronic FP (n=26) or iliac (n=6) ISR. Although technical success was 100%, 
primary patency at 6 months and 12 months was 75% and 58.1% respectively. On the 
other hand, Wissgott et al.22 reported on 78 patients with ISR treated with the Rotarex S 
catheter (lesion length 147 mm). Technical success was high at 97.4% and restenosis at 1 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 12 of 68 year was remarkably low at 18.4%. SilverHawk atherectomy also showed mixed results. 
In a cohort of 43 patients with FP ISR (mean lesion length of 131 mm), Zeller et al12 
showed patency and TLR rates of 54% and 53% respectively at one year with the 
SilverHawk catheter (currently contraindicated in treating FP ISR). Given the 
a
pproximate same mean lesion length (mean of 126.2 mm), Shammas et al10, showe d a 
TLR rate of 31.7% in 41 consecutive patients treated for FP ISR at one year with 
S
ilverHawk. Laird et al.23re cently reported the results of the SALVAGE trial with the use 
of the excimer laser and the Viabahn (W.L.Gore and Associates, Newark, DE) covered 
stent i
n treating FP ISR. The primary patency at 12 months was measured by duplex 
ultrasonography. Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. The mean lesion length was 200.7 
mm and the majority of lesions were TASC C/D. Procedural success was achieved in 
100% of cases. Primary patency and TLR at 12 months were 48% and 17.4% 
respectively. This prospective single arm registry does not distinguish, however, between 
the relative effectiveness of the laser versus the Viabahn endograft stent in reducing 
restenosis in FP ISR lesions.  
Recently 3 randomized trials were presented in treating FP ISR; the EXCITE ISR 
trial (randomized laser + PTA vs PTA alone),  the RELINE trial (randomized Viabahn 
stent vs P
TA) and the Randomized Femoral Artery In-Stent Restenosis (FAIR) 
Tr
ial.18,19, 34. In the GORE VIABAHN (W.L Gore and Associates, Newark, Delaware, 
USA) Versus Plain Old Balloon Angioplasty (PTA) for Superficial Femoral Artery 
(SF
A) In-Stent Restenosis (RELINE) trial19, Viabhan endograft stent was shown to be 
superior to PTA leading to significantly better patency rates at 1 year (37% versus 74.8% 
re
spectively). In the EXCImer Laser Randomized Controlled Study for Treatment of 
Fe
moropopliTEal In-Stent Restenosis (EXCITE ISR) trial18, a multicenter, prospective, 
randomized, controlled trial conducted across 40 U.S. centers. A total of 169 ELA + PTA 
subjects (62.7% male; mean age 68.5 ± 9.8 years) and 81 PTA patients (61.7% male; 
mean age 67.8 ± 10.3 years) were enrolled. Mean lesion length was 19.6 ± 12.0 cm 
versus 19.3 ± 11.9 cm, and 30.5% versus 36.8% of patients exhibited total occlusion. 
ELA + PTA subjects demonstrated superior procedural success (93.5% vs. 82.7%; p = 
0.01) with significantly fewer procedural complications. ELA + PTA and PTA subject 6-
month freedom from TLR was 73.5% versus 51.8% (p < 0.005), and 30-day major 
adverse event rates were 5.8% versus 20.5% (p < 0.001), respectively. ELA + PTA was 
associated with a 52% reduction in TLR (hazard ratio: 0.48; 95% confidence interval: 
0.31 to 0.74). This trial showed that debulking with the laser is an important strategy to 
reduce TLR in treating FP ISR when compared to PTA. Finally, The Randomized 
F
emoral Artery In-Stent Restenosis (FAIR) Trial34, randomized 119 patients with 
superficial femoral artery in-stent restenosis to drug coated balloon (DCB) (n=62) versus 
PTA (n=57). Mean lesion length was 82.2±68.4 mm. and 28.6% of lesions were totally 
occluded. The primary end point of recurrent in-stent restenosis assessed by ultrasound at 
6 months was 15.4% (8 of 52) in the DCB and 44.7% (21 of 47) in the PTA group 
(P=
0.002). Freedom from target lesion revascularization was 96.4% versus 81.0% 
(P=0.0117) at 6 months and 90.8% versus 52.6% (P<0.0001) at 12 months, respectively. 
No major amputation was needed. Two patients in the DCB and 3 patients in the PTA 
g
roup died. No death was procedure related.

promisi
ng technology in the treatment of FP ISR. Data however is mostly applicable for 
short (less than 10 cm) and intermediate lesions (10-15 cm). Patency with DCB ranged 
from 70.5 to 92.1% with TLR from 9.2 to 13.6% at 1 year. Also in intermediate lesions, 
DCS using the Zilver PTX showed patency and TLR rates of 95% and 3.8% and 78.8% 
and 19% at 6 months and 1 year follow up respectively. Combining atherectomy and 
DCB may offer a superior treatment modality than either device alone.  A small 
observational study showed that laser with DCB has a patency of 91.7% and TLR of 
7.1% at a mean follow up of 19.1 months.  Also DCB with directional atherectomy 
yielded a patency rate of 84.7% at 1 year in mean lesion length of 15.3 cm25,26. Studies 
are currently ongoing to test this hypothesis.

3.3      JetStream Atherectomy in Treating FP ISR 
3.31 Preclinial Studies 
Preclinical data was recently presented at CRT 2015 on the application of JetStream 
atherectomy in ISR and published in JEVT29. Below is a description of these preGLP 
experiments .  
Preprocedure Animal Care 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 14 of 68 A Yorkshire swine model was chosen as the experimental animal because of the 
similarity to humans in terms of the size and anatomy of the cardiovascular system. 
Furthermore, this model has been validated for the occurrence of restenosis within 1 
month of stent/balloon overstretch injury, making it more practical for testing medical 
devices in treating ISR. All animals were held in quarantine and housed at CBSET 
(Lexington, MA, USA), a facility accredited by the American Association for 
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, under conditions that met or exceeded 
requirements as set forth in the USDA guidelines.1,2 Standard veterinary practices were 
pe
rformed during quarantine, including physical examinations and clinical pathology to 
determine health status before assignment to the study. A nutritionally balanced diet 
appropriate for the species was offered daily to all animals with water ad lib. Animals 
were released from quarantine by the veterinary staff when deemed healthy.  
Animal Preparation  
 All animals were pretreated 1 day before stent implantation with aspirin 650 
orally and clopidogrel 300 mg orally. They were maintained on aspirin (81 mg daily 
orally) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily orally) thereafter until euthanized. Animals received 
Telazol (4–6 mg/kg) intramuscularly as a pre-anesthetic. Isoflurane anesthesia was then 
a
dministered to effect via mask/nosecone, and endotracheal intubation was then 
performed. Following intubation, the animals were maintained on continuous inhalant 
isoflurane anesthesia delivered for the remainder of the procedure. Perioperative 
nifedipine (10 mg/animal placed sublingually) was also administered. The animals were 
prepared for surgery using accepted veterinary care standards. Electrocardiogram leads, a 
pulse oximetry sensor, and a temperature probe were placed for continuous monitoring of 
vital signs. Pre-emptive analgesia (buprenorphine; 0.01– 0.03 mg/kg), was administered 
intramuscularly at anesthesia (prior to surgical incision). The incision site was prepared 
a
nd appropriately draped for aseptic procedures. 
Stent Implantation Procedure 
 The right carotid artery was accessed using a cutdown approach. An introducer 
sheath was advanced into the artery and heparin (50–200 U/kg) was administered 
intra
venously to prolong the activated coagulation time to a target of >275 seconds. A 
guide catheter was then advanced to the iliac arteries under fluoroscopic guidance. The 
femoral arteries were crossed with a 0.035-inch J-tipped guidewire, and the target 
segment was dilated 3 times (30 seconds each) with an oversized angioplasty balloon at 
various pressures and to achieve a 1.2 to 1.5 balloon:artery ratio. Two overlapping 40-
mm-long nitinol S.M.A.R.T. self-expanding stents (5.0 and 6.0 mm in diameter; Cordis 
Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) were then deployed to the dilated target lesion 
(sized 1.2:1 stent:artery). The amount of overlap was either 100% (n=2) or 25% to 50% 
(n=6). The same process was repeated for the contralateral leg. A total of 8 stents were 
deployed in 4 limbs. Following stent implantation in both left and right femoral arteries, 
the animal is weaned off the anesthetic and extubated. Buprenorphine 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg 
was administered intramuscularly every ~4 to 12 hours to provide analgesic coverage 
through at least the first 24 postoperative hours 
Atherectomy Procedure 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 15 of 68  Animals were brought back to the fluoroscopy suite approximately 1 month after 
stent implantation. The anesthesia procedure was repeated as described above. Carotid 
artery access was obtained using cutdown method. Angiographic images of the target 
vessel were obtained with contrast media to characterize the degree of ISR. Quantitative 
vessel angiography (QVA; Centricity Cardiology CA1000 Cardiac Review 2.0 software) 
was used to measure minimum lumen diameter (MLD), plaque surface area (PSA), and 
percent stenosis. An optimal residual stenosis after atherectomy alone was defined as a 
residual percent stenosis <50%.  
 Atherectomy was then carried on by advancing the cutter at a slow speed of 1 to 2 
mm per seconds from the proximal to distal end of the stented segment (one run) over a 
Spartacore wire (Abbott Vascular, Redwood City, CA, USA). Two atherectomy runs 
with BD followed by QVA at the lesion site was performed. Atherectomy was then 
repeated with BU for 4 runs and with QVA of the lesion after each run (Figure 1).  
 
 
 Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) quantitative measurements were also performed 
at baseline, after 2 BD runs, and after each BU run (BU1, BU2, BU3, BU4) on a total of 
24 locations in the proximal, mid, and distal parts of the stented segments (Figure 2).  
 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 16 of 68 
 
 
Minimum lumen area (MLA) within each the 24 locations was determined. PSA was 
calculated from the total stented area at each location minus the MLA. Finally, MLA and 
P
SA at baseline were plotted against net MLA gain and PSA reduction (BU MLA or PSA 
– baseline MLA or PSA), respectively. The minimum MLA and PSA ranges at baseline 
ne
eded for an increase in MLA by 1 to 2 mm and reduction in PSA by 5% to 10% from 
baseline were determined. 
 Device interaction with the implanted stent and subsequent damage of the stent 
was carefully evaluated under fluoroscopy. The process was repeated for the contralateral 
limb. After the last treatment, the animal was euthanized. Stents were evaluated 
postmortem with high resolution radiographs to determine strut damage.  
Statistical analysis 
 Descriptive analysis was performed on all angiographic variables. Single-sampl e 
Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed between MLA obtained after BU runs and 
theoretical maximal MLA of the XC 2.4-3.4 cutter with BU model. Line graphs were 
performed to illustrate the change in MLD, MLA, PSA (with IVUS) and percent stenosis 
with each treatment. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired t test (1-tail) were performed 
to compa
re baseline, BD, and BU 1 to 4 runs using the statistical package in Minitab 17 
(State College, PA, USA). 
 
Results 
The mean vessel diameter was 4.7±0.6 mm and mean lesion length was 61.5±12.6 
mm. The mean baseline (n=8) MLD was 1.73±0.84 mm. Following 2BD and 1 BU runs, 
the mean MLDs were 2.6±0.7 mm (p=0.025) and 3.12±0.39 mm (p=0.005), respectively, 
vs baseline MLD. There was also a significant increase in MLD between 2BD runs and 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 17 of 68 BU1 run (p=0.005). No statistical difference in MLD was seen between BU runs (p>0.05; 
Figure 3A). 
 PSA was significantly reduced between baseline (83.9%±14.8%) and 2 BD 
(67.7%±17.0%, p=0.005) and BU1 (55.4%±9.0%, p=0.005) runs and between BU1 and 
BU2 runs (50.7%±9.7%, p<0.05). No differences in PSA was seen between the BU2, 
BU3, and BU4 runs (p>0.05). Percent stenosis was reduced from a mean of 
63.13%±16.91% to 44.97%±15.0%8 (p=0.005) with BD runs and to 33.51%±6.73% 
(p=0.005) with BU1 run. There was also a significant reduction in percent stenosis 
between 2 BD runs and BU1 run (p=0.01) and between BU1 and BU2 runs 
(30.1%±7.0%, p=0.05). No difference between percent stenosis was seen between BU 2 
to 4 runs (p=0.10; Figure 3B). 
 
 
 The mean baseline MLA by IVUS was 7.8±2.7 mm2. Following 2BD and 1 BU 
runs, the mean MLAs were 8.1±2.5 mm2 (p<0.044) and 8.7±2.0 mm2 (p=0.007), 
respectively, when compared to baseline MLA. There was also a significant increase in 
MLA between 2BD runs and BU1 run (p=0.033) and between BU1 and BU2 runs 
(9.4±2.4 mm2, p=0.007). No statistical difference in MLA was seen between BU 2 to 3 
runs (p>0.05; Figure 4A). 
 PSA was significantly reduced between baseline (65.2%±11.7%) and 2 BD 
(63.0%±10.5%, p=0.015) and BU1 (60.7%±9.2%, p=0.011) runs and between BU1 and 
BU2 runs (57.5%±7.5%, p=0.025). No differences in PSA were seen between the BU2, 
BU3, and BU4 runs (p=0.12; Figure 4B)

 Vessel area measured by IVUS at site of treated stenosis remained unchanged 
between baseline and BU4 run (23.3±5.8 vs 22.5±4.9 mm2, respectively; p=0.73). 
Furthermore, a significant correlation was seen between MLA at baseline and MLA after 
BU runs (p=0.006; Figure 5A) and between PSA at baseline and PSA after BU runs 
(p<0.0001; Figure 5B). An approximate baseline MLA of 8.0 to 9.0 mm2 led to an MLA 
gain of 1 to 2 mm2 and an approximate baseline PSA of 60% to 70% led to a reduction in 
PSA by 5% to 10% using the large cutter BU mode. Finally, theoretical MLA achievable 
from the XC BU 2.4-3.4 device is 9.08 mm2 (A = πr2 using  r=3.4/2=1.7mm). No 
difference was seen between this calculated MLA and the IVUS measured MLAs after 
BU runs, indicating no orbital effect of the device on tissue cutting.

 There were no observed angiographic stent disruptions or stent strut discontinuity 
with IVUS or high resolution radiography (Figure 6) with JetStream Navitus 
atherectomy.  
 
 Using IVUS, JetStream Navitus is a true debulking device with no Dottering 
effect. In one study of post JetStream Navitus atherectomy, total vessel volume remained 
unc
hanged, but tissue volume is reduced and MLD is increased significantly.3 IVUS data 
confirm the same findings by showing that MLA is increased and PSA is reduced, 
indicating true tissue excision within a nitinol self-expanding stent. Furthermore, the 
median MLA change seen after BU runs was statistically similar to the theoretical MLA 
calculated using a BU large cutter, which indicates that effective cutting is limited to the 
perimeter of the device, with no “wobbling” or “orbital” effect. This is a limitation of the 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 20 of 68 device in treating femoropopliteal ISR, as suboptimal tissue excision is therefore 
expected in larger vessel diameter (possibly 7 mm or higher).  
 In this model, stents were positioned at different overlapping lengths to test the 
safety of the device in treating short or long overlapping stent segments, particularly 
when the blades are up. No adverse events or stent-device interaction were seen. Also, 
there was no angiographic evidence of dissection or distal embolization following 
JetStream Navitus atherectomy, but it should be noted that these lesions are relatively 
short and not totally occluded; thus, they have a low potential for embolization.  
 Finally, adjunctive balloon angioplasty was not performed after the JetStream 
Navitus as the intention of the study was to test the effectiveness and safety of the device 
itself rather than the final outcome after adjunctive balloon angioplasty. The residual 
narrowing post atherectomy was a mean of 30.1%, which is consistent with effective 
tissue debulking (<50% residual) with the JetStream Navitus alone and without balloon 
angioplasty. This residual narrowing was accomplished in a mean vessel diameter of 4.7 
mm.

Da
ta recently presented at ICI 2015 in Israel from the same above model using SEM 
and histopathology showed a variable tissue disruption of in-stent restenotic tissue with 
no evidence of adverse effects on the implanted artery (e.g., thrombosis, dissection) or 
the implanted stents. High resolution radiographs showed no evidence of strut fracture or 
displacement.  Histology and SEM showed, despite focal exposures of stent struts related 
to either incomplete neointimal coverage and/or atherectomy, there was no evidence of 
atherectomy-related damage to the stent in these areas. The degree of neointimal 
proliferation in this swine femoral artery ISR model was sufficient to evaluate the 
JetStream atherectomy catheter for safety.

3.32 Clinical studies 
Beschorner et al35 reported data on 33 patients (40 infrainguinal ISR lesions) treated 
with t
he Pathway PV atherectomy system (predecessor of JetStream). Primary patency 
wa
s 33 % after 12 months and 25 % after 24 months. In this study, the majority of the 
lesions were FP (90%) but few lesions were in the peroneal, tibioperoneal and others. The 
vessels had no or mild (<30 degrees) tortuosity.  Lesion length was 85.7 mm. Total 
occlusions were present in 20% of vessels. No serious device-related events were noted. 
Acute procedural success was accomplished in all lesions with adjunctive balloon/stent 
treatment. Distal embolization occurred in 6% of lesions treated and required aspiration 
embolectomy successfully. Bail out stenting was need in one lesion (3%). The Pathway 
PV system used in this study required 8 F system. Since then, the device (currently the 
Jetstream XC) was improved upon with more powerful aspiration and cutting abilities 
and is now compatible with 7 F sheath.  
The recently presented final data of the JetStream ISR study  at New Cardiovascular 
Horizon 201527 (one year TLR data will be presented at LINC 2016)  evaluated acute 
proc
edural and 6-month outcomes, and stent-device interaction of the JetStream Navitus 
in treating FP ISR from 2 U.S. centers (manuscript in Print in JEVT 2016. Copy of 
accepted manuscript is in Appendix B ). Demographic, clinical, angiographic and 
procedural data were collected on 29 patients (32 limbs) included. The primary 
effectiveness endpoint was acute procedural success (<30% residual narrowing with no 
serious adverse events). The primary safety endpoint was freedom from major adverse 
events (MAE). Secondary endpoints include clinically driven target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) at 6 months and stent integrity as assessed by Angiographic Core 
Laboratory. Six-month follow-up was completed on 27 patients (29 limbs). Adjunctive 
balloon angioplasty was performed in 100% at a mean pressure of 11.6 ± 3.3 atm. Total 
lesion length was 17.4 ± 13.1 cm and total treated length 19.5 ± 12.9 cm. Acute 
proc
edural success occurred in 90.6% of limbs. Acute device success (<50% residual 
narrowing after atherectomy alone) was 75.9%. Embolic filter protection (EFP) was used 
in 16/32 (50.0%) of limbs. Macrodebris was noted in 2/16 (12.5%) of filters and distal 
embolization (DE) requiring treatment occurred in 3/32 limbs (9.4%) (2 with no EFP). 
There were no new stent fractures or deformities (n=24) post JS. On 6-month follow-up 
TLR occurred in 4/29 patients (13.8%). Patency rate (PSVR<2.4) was 72%.  Other non-

re
sults were highly encouraging establishing in this feasibility small study the safety and 
effectiveness of the JetStream in treating FP ISR when compared to historic control.  
Observational data also are available from the multicenter xl-PAD registry that 
provided insight into how JetStream is applied in a real world registry28. Jetstream™ 
atherectomy was performed in 68 procedures. Patients’ average age was 68.5 years, 
66.2% were male, and 89.7% Caucasian. Average ankle-brachial index was 0.74 ±0.25,  
average Rutherford category was 3.15 ±0.78, and 17.7% presented with critical limb 
ischemia. Lesions were long (133.9 ±106.8 m m), and located mostly in the superficial 
femoral artery (85.3%), followed by the popliteal (13.2%), and posterior tibial artery 
(1.5%). In-stent restenotic (ISR) lesions comprised 47.1% , chronic total occlusions 
22.1%, and lesions with heavy calcification 27.9%. Procedural success was 94.1%. 
Additi
onal stenting was performed in 25 % lesions and 42.6%  used embolic protection 
with the Nav-6 (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) filter. There were 3 (4.4%) distal 
embolizations, all in unprotected cases that were successfully treated with aspiration-
thrombectomy. At 12-months post-procedure, target limb revascularization rate was 
20.6%, stent thrombosis 1.5%, and amputation-free survival 98.5%.  
Finally, a small feasibility study36 to assess the role of adjunctive balloon angioplasty 
a
fter optimal debulking with JetStream was evaluated in 6 patients (total 15 lesions) with 
femoropopliteal instent restenosis. This demonstrated similar results to the porcine model 
above where maximum debulking was reached after 2 blades up mode but adjunctive 
balloon angioplasty added a significant increase in MLD post Jetstream (see figure 
below)

4.0 METHODOLOGY 
4.1 ST UDY DESIGN  
This is a prospective, multicenter (up to 14 sites), single arm study. Patients will be 
tre
ated with plaque excision using JetStream XC (JS) followed by adjunctive balloon 
angioplasty (PTA). Each subject must meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria.  
A subje
ct will be enrolled in the study only after angiography and confirmation of ISR in 
the FP segment.  All subjects will be followed up to 6 months after enrolment for the 
prima
ry endpoint and 1 year for several secondary endpoints.  
 
Study Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to assess and estimate the effect of treating FP ISR with 
plaque
 excision using JS in combination with adjunctive PTA and compare this to 
historic control of PTA.

4.4       SUBJECT SELECTION CRITERIA  
Assessment of eligibility is based on data available to the Investigator at the time of 
subj
ect enrollment. 
P
atients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (Rutherford Becker Class II to 
IV) will be enrolled if they have been previously treated with stenting in the 
femoropopliteal segment and now return with suspicion of restenosis. There is no limit on 
how many times the target in-stent restenotic lesion has been previously treated. Also 
there is no exclusion based on how the prior treatment was done including if drug eluting 
balloons or stents have been used. Covered stents cannot be included however including 
Viabhan stents. There is no limit on the length of the target lesion as long as only one 
target lesion is treated and enrolled. If there is more than one target lesion per vessel, this 
will be considered an exclusion. Patients will be considered enrolled in the study 
following the index angiogram and if they are deemed by the operator to meet the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and prior to commencement of any 
therapeutic intervention. In this study, and in order to ensure adequate representation of 
minority and ethnic groups affected by PAD, our target for the Black population will be 
about 15% of all patients enrolled and for females a minimum of 30%

4.56 WALKING IMPAIRMENT QUESTIONNAIRE (WIQ)   
Each subject will undergo a WIQ assessment and the results will be documented at 
ba
seline and all follow-up visits.  The WIQ is an interviewer-administered subject-
reported functional assessment focused on difficulty in walking.   
4.57 ANG IOGRAM  
For procedural angiogram requirements see Section 4.62.  Angiograms will be obtained 
per the Angiographic Protocol determined by the Angiographic Core.  
4.58 DUP LEX ULTRASOUND (DUS) 
It is required that the subject undergo a DUS , the results be documented and copies of the 
scan be sent to the core laboratory.  DUS is  required within 45 days of the index 
proc
edure (at either the pre-discharge or 30-day visit), at 6 months, and at 1 year post-
procedure. DUS will be obtained as per Core lab protocol.    
4.59 ADV ERSE EVENT (AE)  EVALUATION

4.61 PR OCEDURE REQUIREMENTS  
The subject will undergo percutaneous revascularization of the superficial femoral and/or 
popliteal arteries. The JS + adjunctive PTA will be used to treat all lesion. Operators 
should have at least a minimum experience with 10 Jetstream cases as a primary operator 
to qualify to enroll patients in this study.  
The following describes the required assessments and activities during the procedure.   
4.62 ANG IOGRAM  
A sheath will be inserted and after insertion the subject should receive anticoagulation 
medic
ations as indicated by the Investigator to maintain appropriate clotting time.  
S
elective angiography of the limb to be treated including the distal aorta, bilateral iliac, 
ipsilateral femoral, popliteal and tibial-peroneal vessels (to the pedal level) will b e 
pe
rformed to identify the anatomical characteristics of the vasculature and to best isolate 
and define the lesion.  If a pre-procedure assessment has been completed with 
CTA/MRA, the angiography can be limited to the target vessel, with a baseline 
assessment of run-off.  Angiography must be conducted according the Angiographic 
P
rotocol (refer to Core Lab requirement ).  Gadolinium and CO2 are not allowed for use 
as contract material. 
During angiography the Investigator performing the procedure will assess the subject for 
the a
ngiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria.  It is required that a radiopaque ruler b e 
used to define lesion length and define anatomical measurement references.  If the subject 
mee
ts all the angiographic inclusion criteria and does not meet any of the angiographic 
exclusion criteria, the subject is enrolled when an exchangeable guidewire crosses the 
target lesion.  Upon enrollment, subject s will  be then treated with the JS + PTA as per 
protoc
ol.  
Angiographic films, including run-off, will be obtained immediately prior to and after 
tre
atment (after JS alone, and after adjunctive PTA or bail out stenting) according to the 
Ang
iographic  Core Lab Protocol.  Capture images that demonstrate the stenosis in two 
views that minimize the degree of vessel overlap and demonstrate the stenosis in its most 
se
vere view.  Angiographic results must be sent to the Angiographic Core L abo ratory. 
The Angiographic Core Laboratory assessments will supersede the measurements by the 
Investigator performing the procedure for data analysis purposes; however, the 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 33 of 68 measurements by the Investigator performing the procedure will be used to determine 
subj
ect eligibility at the time of enrollment.   
The Angiographic core laboratory will also assess stent fracture location and severity at 
baseline prior to any treatment and post atherectomy to assess for additional/worsening 
fractures. 
4.63 TRE ATMENT OF THE TARGET VESSEL  
4.641 TARG ET LESION  
The lesion intended for treatment at the time of the index procedure that meets the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be considered the “target lesion.”  
Ea
ch subject can have only one target lesion.  The point of enrollment is defined as the 
moment an exchangeable guidewire and treatment catheter cross the target lesion in the 
true
 lumen.  
If there are 5 cm or less between diseased segments needing treatment in the SFA and/or 
popliteal artery, then it can be considered one lesion (see example below).  If there are 
more
 than 5 cm between diseased segments, they will be considered separate lesions and 
c
ount as two or more lesions.  If multiple lesions in the target vessel require treatment, 
pa
tient not eligible for enrolment  
 
 
4.642  TREATMENT OF NON-TARGET VESSELS  
Lesions in the ipsilateral or contralateral iliac arteries or ipsilateral common femoral 
arteries to the target limb that require treatment may be revascularized during the index 
proc
edure. These lesions must be successfully treated prior to the point of enrollment. 
S
tent placement in the common femoral arteries will exclude patient from enrolment. 
I
f a patient has an infrapopliteal lesion that require s treatment for significant (> 70% 
stenosis or occlusion) stenosis , patient cannot be enrolled.  
L
esions in the non-target limb may be treated du ring the index procedure, but not within 
or e
qual 30 days following the index procedure.   
4.643 JS + PTA  GROUP PROCEDURES  
The selection of the JS XC device will be at the discretion of the treating physician.  In 
general however, the 2.4 XC is for vessel diameter > 5 cm and 2.1 XC for 4-5 cm. The 
plaque excision procedure will follow the steps described in the published manual by 
S
hammas et al.2 The Spartacore (Abbott) or JetStream Wire (Boston Scientific) are 
re
commended with the use of the JetStream device. The Grand Slam wire and 
hydrophilic wires are not recommended. Filters are highly encouraged but left to 
investigator’s discretion. If a filter is used, the off label use of the Nav-6 (Abbott) filter is  7 cm   5 cm  5 cm 
17 cm   Single lesion:  17 cm lesion since separation is ≤ 5.0 cm  
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 34 of 68 recommended. The long BareWire will need to be used. JetStream IFU has no 
recommendations on filter use.  
Residual stenosis following the plaque excision treatment must be documented by 
a
ngiography per the Angiographic Protocol. It is recommended that residual stenosis be < 
50% prior to treatment with adjunctive PTA.   
Dilation of the
 lesion following JS has to be done with a 1:1 balloon size and avoidance 
of oversizing.  The diameter of the study balloon will be selected based on the vessel 
re
ference diameter distal to the target lesion. Balloon inflation should be limited to within 
the ste
nt. See section 4.43 for details.    
If there is a complication during JS, treatment is at the operator’s discretion.  If a 
perforation occurs in the area of plaque excision, it must be sealed and distal outflow 
must
 be established.  
4.644 ADJ UNCTIVE PROCEDURES  
Adjunctive procedures besides PTA should be avoided if possible.  In the event of a 
major flow limiting dissection (type D and higher), perforation, or occlusive complication 
(
e.g., recoil), prolonged balloon inflation (5 minutes) must be attempted first.  All efforts 
shoul
d be made to eliminate the need for bail-out stent placement.  In cases where the 
results after prolonged balloon inflation are suboptimal, bail-out stenting is allowed.  A 
c
ine following the prolonged balloon inflation must be captured; all bail-out stenting 
proc
edures will be reviewed by the Angiographic Core Laboratory.  Adjunctive treatment 
with cutti
ng balloons or scoring balloons is not allowed. Adjunctive or primary PTA 
shoul
d be done with a non-compliant or semi compliant balloon sized 1:1 to vessel size. 
Adjunctive stenting is performed only with self-expanding nitinol stent. Drug coated 
stents, covered stents, or drug coated balloons are not allowed in the study.  
4.645 PR OCEDURE COMPLETION  
An angiogram of the treated segment(s) must be recorded for subsequent Angiographic 
Core Laboratory analysis of the post-treatment residual stenosis.  
The
 end of the procedure is defined as the time after a complete angiogram, including 
runoff, has been performed AND the last guidewire and catheter have been removed.  If 
the subject returns to the procedure room and a guiding catheter is reinserted and dilation 
is performed, this is considered a re-intervention and should be documented accordingly.  
The sheath(s) may be removed at the physician’s discretion. 
4.646 ADV ERSE EVENT EVALUATION  
An AE evaluation will be performed during and at the end of the procedure.  See Section 
4.20 for the AE definitions.  Adverse event evaluations will also occur prior to discharge 
and at all follow-up visits.   
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 35 of 68 4.647  MEDICAL ANTICOAGULANT /ANTIPLATELET THERAPY  
Pre-Procedure 
The subject should be optimally medically-managed for peripheral arterial disease per the 
standard institutional regimen.  
Peri-Procedure 
The subject should receive anticoagulatio n as indicated by the Investigator to maintain 
a
ppropriate activated clotting time (ACT). For patients receiving bivalirudin, ACT is not 
ne
cessary. For patients receiving heparin, the ACT goal is 250 seconds (Using iStat) or 
300 seconds using Hemochron. If patient is on clopidogrel or other ADP receptor 
antagonist, this will be continued as prescribed. If patient is on Ticagrelor, only 81 mg of 
ASA daily should be prescribed. If patient is not on ADP receptor antagonist, he will be 
loaded with clopidogrel 600 mg po x one dose (or equivalent drug).  
Post-Procedure 
The subject should be optimally medically-managed for peripheral arterial disease per the 
standard institutional regimen. Post procedure, patients should be continued on 
c
lopidogrel (or an equivalent drug) 75 mg po daily for 3 months and aspirin indefinitely. 
I
f patient is on ticagrelor, asa 81 mg po daily is prescribed.

4.651  UNSCHEDULED AND RE-INTERVENTION VISITS DURING FOLLOW -UP 
Completion of study assessments at unscheduled follow-up visits prior to the 1-year visit 
should be done as clinically indicated and corresponding data should be documented and 
subm
itted to the Sponsor. 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 38 of 68 If a subject is clinically indicated for a re-intervention of the target lesion prior to the 1 -
year follow-up visit and the subject does not want to proceed with an invasive angiogram 
or r
e-intervention, it will not be considered a deviation from the Study Protocol.   If 
possi
ble, all non-invasive assessments should be captured for the study, including ABI, 
RCC, WIQ, and duplex ultrasound, even if the re-intervention and angiogram are 
de
clined.  Copies of any angiographic or duplex ultrasound results must be sent to the 
appropriate core laboratory. These data will be collected and used for adjudication by the 
C
linical Event Committee for “clinically-driven” reintervention. 
The investigator will initially determine the lesion severity by visual 
estimate prior to re -intervention. The cine angiogram will be sent to 
angiographic core lab for analysis. Two orthogonal views of the lesi on 
will be required to determine more accurately the lesion severity by the 
core lab. Core lab evaluation of lesion severity will be used as the 
more definitive measure and supersedes operator's visual estimate.  
The following describes what take precedenc e (angiogram versus duplex 
ultrasound) to determine lesion severity:1. Patient has both modalities 
because of symptoms recurrence prior to 6 months follow up. To be 
consistent with the 6 months’ primary endpoint the Duplex ultrasound 
will take precedence  
2. Patient has an giogram only because of symptom  recurrence prior to 6 
months. In this case the angiographic finding of loss of patency will be 
used as no Duplex ultrasound was performed. The Duplex ultrasound at 6 
months post reintervention will not be use d even if perfor med as it is 
post re- intervention .  
3. Patient undergoes both modalities at 6  months because of symptoms. 
Duplex ultrasound  will take precedence as long as it has been done prior 
to the angiogram and re -intervention.  
 
4.652 TE RMINATION OF PARTICIPATION  
All subjects have the right to withdraw from participation at any point during the study.  
I
n addition, Principal Investigators also have the ability to terminate subject participation 
in the study.  A description of the reason for a subject’s termination will be documented.  
R
easons for termination include: subject withdrawal, physician-directed subject 
withdrawal, and lost- to- follow-up.   
4.653 LOST  TO FOLLOW -UP 
Every attempt must be made to have all subjects complete the required follow-up visit s 
a
ccording to the visit schedule.  A subject will not be considered lost- to- follow-up unless 
efforts to obtain compliance are unsuccessful.  At a minimum, the effort to obtain follow-
up information must include three attempts to make contact via telephone.  Telephone 
contact efforts to obtain follow-up must be documented in both the subject’s medical 
records and on the study electronic case report forms (e CRF s).   
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 39 of 68 4.654  SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL  
W
henever possible, the site staff should obtain written documentation from the subject 
that wishes to withdraw his/her consent for future follow-up visits and contact.  If the site 
staff is unable to obtain written documentation, all information regarding the subject’s 
withdrawal must be recorded in the subject’s medical record.  In addition, the appropriate 
eCRFs must be completed for the subject and clear documentation of the subject’s 
withdra
wal must be provided to the Sponsor.   
Withdrawal of a subject from the study can occur at the discretion of the Principal 
I
nvestigator or the Spons or.  Reasons for physician and/or Sponsor-directed subject 
withdra
wal include, but are not limited to: the subject is not adhering to the Study 
P
rotocol requirements, the subject has enrolled in another study that conflicts with th is 
S
tudy Protocol outcomes, or if it is in the best interest for the safety or welfare of the 
subje
ct to withdraw. 
4.655 DE VIATIONS TO THE STUDY 
Principal Investigators and site staffs should avoid Study Protocol deviations. Any 
deviations from clinical protocol requirements will be considered protocol deviations and 
ne
ed to be reported to the Sponsor.  Any emergency deviations (deviations from the 
S
tudy Protocol to protect the life or physical well being of a subject, such as, surgical 
re
pair of the target vessel) that occur must be reported to the Sponsor and the site Ethics 
C
ommittee (EC) per their local guidelines.   
4.656  ADVERSE EVENTS  
4.657 ADV ERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined as any untoward and unintended clinical sign, 
symptom, or disease in a subject, regardless of the relationship between the adverse event 
and the device under investigation, that: 
 Led to a death,  
 L ed to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that: 
1. R esulted in a life-threatening illness or injury,  
2. R esulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  
3. Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
or  
4. R esulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment 
to a body structure or body function.   
 Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.   
A written report must be provided to the Sponsor or representative within 24 hours of the 
Investigator learning of an SAE and must be provided to the EC according to reporting 
guidelines. 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 40 of 68 4.658  ADVERSE EVENT CLASSIFICATIONS  
In addition to the definitions above, adverse events will be classified as follows: 
Major Adverse Events 
1. Major Adverse Events (MAE) as individual endpoints in- hospital and 
u
p to 30 days :   Include device-induced vascular injury as reported by the 
ope
rator, amputation (major and minor unplanned), death, significant 
dist
al embolization requiring the use of pharmacologic or mechanical 
means to treat (other than a vasodilator), perforation (extravasation of 
blood out
side the vessel wall), major bleeding, non-fatal myocardial 
infa
rction (defined as the occurrence of more than 20 minutes of chest 
pa
in post procedure with an increase in troponin), stroke, access 
complications (AV fistula and pseudoaneurysm), bail out stenting, ac ute 
renal failure (drop in crcl by > 25% from baseline), acute (< 24 hours) or 
subacute (< 1 month , > than 24 hours) vessel closure.  
2. Target Lesion failure at 6 months and 1 year:  Defined as major 
unplanned amputation related of the treated limb, vascular mortality 
related to treated limb and target lesion revascularization at 6 months and 
1 year (stenting in the lab is not considered a TLR) 
3. M ajor Adverse Event Rate at 6 months and 1 Year: Defined as major 
unplanned amputation of the treated limb, all-cause mortality or TLR at 6 
mont
hs and 1 year (bail out stent in the Lab is included as TLR) 
 
Unanticipated or Unexpected Adverse Device Effects:  any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, 
or degree of incidence in the protocol or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that 
re
lates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
4.659 ADV ERSE EVENT RELATIONSHIPS  
The Investigators will evaluate whether or not the adverse events were related to the 
procedure, study requirements, and/or investigational products (e.g., JS  device, 
a
ngioplasty balloon, drug coating) according to the following categories: 
Related:   AE that has a strong temporal relationship to the study procedure, a study 
re
quirement, or the presence or performance of the investigational device/system or drug 
and an alternative etiology is highly unlikely. 
Possibly Related:  AE that has a temporal relationship to the study procedure, a study 
re
quirement, or the presence or performance of the investigational device/system or drug 
and an alternative etiology is unlikely. 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 41 of 68 Not Related:   AE is due to the underlying disease state or concomitant medication or 
ther
apy, and was not caused by the study procedure, a study requirement, or the 
investigational device/system or drug. 
Not Assessable:   It is not possible to assess whether or not the adverse event is related to 
the study procedure, a study requirement, or the investigational device/system or drug. 
4.660 DE ATHS  
Each subject death must be reported to the Sponsor.  A death must be reported to the 
Sponsor or representative as soon as possible (within 24 hours) after the site’s knowledge 
of the
 event.  A written report will be provided to the Sponsor within 10 business days 
a
fter the Investigator learns of a death and will be provided to the EC  according to 
re
porting guidelines.   It is requested that a copy of the death certificate, autopsy report, 
a
nd any other source documents related to the death be sent to the Sponsor or 
re
presentative when available.  In the event that no source documents are available, the PI 
will
 be required to submit a letter to the Sponsor describing the circumstances of the 
subj
ect’s death.

5.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
5.1 SAM PLE SIZE  
 
5.11 Meta-analysis of PTA control arms from randomized trials 
 
Please refer to Appendix A at end of protocol   
 
5.12 Assumptions: 
 
T
LR with bailout stenting from historic control from meta-analysis:  37.9% 
TLR with bailout stenting from Jetstream ISR feasibility study:  20.7% 
Power 80% 
Alpha 0.05 
 
W
e are planning a study of independent cases and controls with 1 control(s) per 
case.  Prior data indicate that the failure rate among controls is 0.38.  If the true failure 
rate for experimental subjects is 0.21, we will need to study 112 experimental subjects 
and 112 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the failure rates for 
e
xperimental and control subjects are equal with probability (power) 0.8 (meta-analysis 
from published randomized trials provides data on 182 controls).   The Type I error 
probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.  We will use an 
uncorrected chi-squared statistic to evaluate this null hypothesis. Assumingly a loss of 
20%
 of patients on follow-up a minimum of 134 patients will be enrolled.

5.23 GE NERAL PRINCIPLES  
All statistical analyses will be performed using a widely accepted statistical or graphical 
software.  An intention to treat analysis will be carried on with bailout stenting as TLR 
a
nd without bail out stenting as TLR. Also analysis will be done by actual treatment. A 
maximum of 140 patients will be enrolled. 
De
scriptive statistics will be used to present the data and to summarize the results.  
Disc
rete variables will be presented using frequency distributions and cross tabulations.  
C
ontinuous variables will be summarized by presenting the number of observations (N), 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values.    
F
or AE reporting, the primary analysis will be based on subject counts.  A subject with 
more
 than one event will be counted only once toward the event rate based on the total 
number of subjects with AEs.  An event rate based on event counts will also be 
pre
sented.  For example, if a subject experiences one major unplanned amputation of the 
tre
ated limb and two clinically-driven TLRs within 30 days, the subject will be counted 
once in the rate of total subjects with a 30-day MAE; the same subject will be counted 
onc
e in the individual event category of “Major Unplanned Amputation of the Treated 
Limb” and twice in the “Clinically-Driven TLR” category.     
5.24 ANALYS IS OF BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS AND PROCEDURAL CHARACTERISTICS  
Descriptive analysis will be performed on all clinically relevant baseline demographics 
and procedural variables using percentages for dichotomous variables and mean +/- 
Standard deviations for continuous variables 
5.25 ANALYS IS OF OUTCOMES    
W
e hypothesize that JetStream atherectomy is superior to plain old balloon angioplasty in 
treating femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis in regards to the primary effectiveness 
endpoint of target lesion revascularization at 6 months with bailout stenting considered as 
a TLR. The Null Hypothesis assumes that the active control (JetStream) and the historic 
control of TLR (derived from the meta-analysis) have the same TLR at 6 months by 
intention to treat analysis. We calculated that if TLR is 0.38 for balloon angioplasty and 
0.21 f
or JetStream, we need a total of 112 experimental subject and 112 control to reject 
the null hypothesis with a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05. The meta-analysis has provided 
data on TLR for balloon angioplasty in more than 112 controls. To account for patient 
loss to follow up we plan to enroll a maximum number of 140 patients in this study 
5.26 ANALYS IS OF ABILITY TO POOL DATA ACROSS INVESTIGATIONAL SITES 
This is a multi-center clinical study with standardization of subject enrollment, data entry 
and adverse event reporting.  All investigational sites will follow the requirements of a 
c
ommon protocol, and common data collection procedures and forms.  To present the 
da
ta from this clinical study in a summary form, a comparison across all sites will be 
completed to determine if the generated data can be pooled.  
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 44 of 68 Potential site effects on the primary outcome will be explored.  In addition, a comparison 
of
 variables will be completed to assess the appropriateness of pooling data from across 
a
ll sites.  
6
.0 RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
 
The study is designed to minimize risk through observance of strict site and Investigator 
selection criteria, careful subject selection and management, and rigorous adherence to a 
standardized schedule of post-procedure evaluations. The recommendations in the IFU 
will be used for wire selection.  
6.1 PO TENTIAL BENEFITS  
There are no guaranteed benefits from participation in this study; however, it has been 
shown that treatment with plaque excision improves blood flow through the treated artery 
in som
e patients.  Information gained from the conduct of this study may be of benefit to 
other persons with the same medical condition.   
6.2 PO TENTIAL RISKS  
6.3 RI SKS ASSOCIATED WITH PLAQUE EXCISION  
The risks associated with JS atherectomy of the SFA and/or popliteal artery may include, 
but ar
e not limited to, the following: 
MCRF-S- 002-2016 , Version 2 .0                              29 February 2016                             Page 45 of 68  Ac cess site complications  
 Amputation  
 Ar terial dissection 
 Ar terial perforation  
 Ar terial rupture  
 Ar terial spasm  
 Ar terial thrombosis 
 Ar terio-venous (AV) fistula 
 B leeding complications  
 De ath  
 Embol ism 
 De vice getting stuck on stent 
 W ire breaking during 
atherectomy 
 Emergency or non-emergency 
arterial bypass surgery  
 Hypotension  
 I nfection  
 I schemia  
 R estenosis of the treated 
segment  
 Total occlusion of the 
peripheral artery  
 Va scular complications which 
may require surgical repair  
 Disruption of previously 
implanted stent 
 
46 
 As w
ith any device requiring mechanical deployment and retraction, there exists a risk of 
mechanical failure of the device resulting in potential surgical intervention. 
All of the above could cause prolonged illness, permanent impairment of daily function or, in 
rare cases, death.  Possible treatments could include, but are not limited to, vascular surgery. 
Extensive reliability engineering testing has been performed on the study device to mitigate risks 
to the subject due to product failure.  Additionally, studies using the JS device have been 
conduc
ted to ensure that the systems perform as intended without introducing more risks during 
the index procedure or during follow-up.  Risks of atherectomy may be further limited by 
providing medications such as aspirin or clopidogrel and continuing to monitor subjects 
following treatment.   
While some of the potential risks identified have occurred in prior atherectomy trials, and while 
Boston Scientific believes that the risk for significant injury or death due to the JS XC device is 
quite low, these risks have yet to be adequately and fully quantified.   These risks in applying  
the JS to  in-stent restenosis has not been defined in a large trial  but early preclinical  data and 
the JetStream ISR feasibility study has  shown that the device performed safely with no  device-
stent interaction .   
 
 
6.4 RI SK MITIGATION  
 
 
The CEC committee will adjudicate every adverse events and unexpected device related events. 
DSMB will meet at completion of the first 30 patients and at 60 patients to analyze   procedural 
and follow up events. Recommendations will be made to continue or stop the study based on 
these 2 interim analysis.  All investigators will have to prove experience with at least 10 
Jetstream cases with no significant events. Also, investigators will be trained on the protocol to 
ensure adherence to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and for timely reporting of adverse 
e
vents as recommended by the IRB and FDA. Subjects will learn about the protocol from 
investigators and designated coordinators. Voluntary participation will be emphasized. Patients 
will sign informed consent form ( see Appendix C for the ICF ).

9.3  RE CORDS CUSTODY  
An Investigator may withdraw from the study.  If the Principal Investigator withdraws from the 
stud
y, responsibility for follow-up and maintaining the records must be transferred to a 
responsible party (such as another study Investigator).  Notice of transfer must be provided in 
writing by the Principal Investigator to the Sponsor and the EC no later than 10 working days 
after transfer occurs. 
9.4 IRB  AP PROVALS  
IRB written approval will be obtained before being allowed to conduct and participate in the 
study. This approval letter must identify the study name, approved protocol number (including 
revision number), the date of the approval as well as the expiration date of such an approval.  
The investigator is responsible for fulfilling any conditions of approval imposed by the IRB, 
suc
h as regular reporting, study timing, and for maintaining continuation of the approval during 
the entire study period.  The investigator must also keep on file all correspondence with the IRB 
and forward copies of such correspondence to MCRF.  
9.5 INF ORMED CONSENT  
MCRF will provide a template ICF for IRB submission prior to the site initiation.  This 
template
 may be modified to suit the requirements of the individual study site.   
 
51 
 A 
copy of the ICF must be given to each subject enrolled in the study.  The investigator or 
assigned designee must administer this approved ICF to each prospective study subject, and 
obtain the subject's signature or a legally approved designee’s signature along with the date of 
consent prior to enrollment in the study.   The ICF must be obtained in accordance with the 
applicable guidelines on 21 CFR Part 50, current GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki,  ISO 
14155 (1) and (2), or local regulations and laws, whichever represents the greater protection 
of the individual.  The subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the study 
at any time and for any reason without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled and also informed that withdrawal from the study will not 
jeopardize their future medical care.  The institutional standard subject consent form does not 
replace the study ICF. 
9.6 INF ORMED CONSENT (ICF) 
All information and data sent to MCRF concerning subjects or their participation in this 
stud
y will be considered confidential.  All data used in the analysis and reporting of this 
evaluation will be used in a manner without identifiable reference to the subject.  The 
investigator consents to audits by the staff of MCRF and its authorized local governmental body 
to re
view the study subjects’ medical records, including any test or laboratory data that might 
have been recorded on diagnostic test media. 
9.7 AM ENDING THE PROTOCOL  
The protocol can be amended only by the Sponsor. All changes must be submitted to the 
IRB for review and approval. Any change that would require alteration of the ICF must receive 
a
pproval from the IRB prior to implementation.  Following approval, the protocol amendment 
will be distributed to all protocol recipients at the study sites.  
9.8 PR OTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A Protocol Deviation CRF must be completed for each study protocol deviation (e.g., failure 
to obt
ain informed consent, enrolling a subject who does not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
not performing required testing, missed follow-up visits, etc.).  Investigators must notify the 
re
viewing IRB of any deviation from the Study Protocol that was done to protect the life or 
physical well-being of a subject (medical emergencies).  Such notice should be given within 48 
hours where feasible but no later than 5 days after occurrence.  
9.9 CASE  REPORTS FORMS (CRF) 
CRFs for individual subjects will be developed by MCRF or subcontracted by MCRF to a 
qualified CRO. CRFs are used to record study data and are an integral part of the study and 
subsequent reports.  After the data have been submitted, corrections will be initiated via queries 
to be completed by study site personnel to investigator.  CRFs and queries must be signed by the 
investigator 
 
1
0.0 DATA and QUALITY MANAGEMENT 
 
 
52 
 A f
ull-featured relational database will be on a secure central server that is backed up regularly. 
The
 server will be accessible by password for all approved users via the internet, and data 
analytical workstations will be used for data processing and management.  Conventional data 
verification sub-routines will be extensively programmed to test entry and logical errors, while 
all individual (subject-based) eCRFs will be linked for cross-reference.  Periodic analysis of each 
da
ta field (across subjects) will be performed in order to examine the expected distributions of 
da
ta, and to identify outliers for possible data mistakes.  Corrections to data mistakes will be 
requested via queries.  Each completed query response must be verified by the Investigator (or 
de
signee) and submitted.  
All i
nformation and data concerning subjects or their participation in this study will be 
considered confidential.  Only authorized personnel will have access to these confidential files.  
All data used in the analysis and reporting of this evaluation will be without identifiable 
reference to the subject.

1.0 PUBLICATION STRATEGY 
 
 
At the conclusion of all 1-year follow-up visits, a multi-site abstract reporting the preliminary 
results may be prepared and presented at one or more major endovascular meetings by Dr 
Nic
olas Shammas.  A multi-site publication may also be prepared for print in a peer-reviewed 
sc
ientific journal at the conclusion of the study. Following the national PIs (Shammas and 
B
anerjee), additional co-authors will be added to the main manuscript by order of number of 
patients enrolled in the study. Final number of coauthors will be determined based on patient 
e
nrolment, quality of data and lack of significant protocol violation. Investigators with 
significant protocol deviations that jeopardize data quality may not be considered as authors. The 
final decision for co-authorship will be determined by the Sponsor.  
The publication of results from any single-site experience within the study must not be submitted 
for publication (by itself or as part of other registries) until approval from the Sponsor is granted 
a
nd after the publication of the main manuscript.  A proposal for a publication will be sent to the 
Sponsor for review and approval. MCRF will review and approve all publications for 
pre
sentation at any meeting or for publications in journals or magazines. A significant 
c
ontribution by each author is expected for authorship. The national PIs are expected to review, 
approve and co-author any additional publications prior to submission to Journals or other 
publications media resulting from this study.

Meta-analysis 
 
We completed a meta-analysis for the 3 randomized trials published (1-3) with femoropopliteal 
in-stent restenosis where the control arm was balloon angioplasty alone. Below is a table of this 
meta-analysis. This showed that TLR with balloon angioplasty alone was 37.9%.

The Breslow- Day test indicates that TLR with Bailout has no heterogeneity and thus can be 
combined into a meta-statistic (p-value=0.1764) (Figure below).

If one
 assumes a 1:1 ratio of actual treatment:control (instead of the original 2:1) 
 
W
e are planning a study of independent cases and controls with 1 control(s) per case.  
Prior data indicate that the failure rate among controls is 0.38.  If the true failure rate for 
experimental subjects is 0.21, we will need to study 112 experimental subjects and 112 control 
subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control 
subjects are equal with probability (power) 0.8 (meta-analysis provides 182 controls which is 
more
 than needed for this analysis).   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this 
null hypothesis is 0.05.  We will use an uncorrected chi-squared statistic to evaluate this null 
hypothesis. Assumingly a loss of 20% of patients on follow-up a minimum of 134 patients will 
be
 enrolled.

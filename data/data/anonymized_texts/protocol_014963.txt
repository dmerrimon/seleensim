An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will be established to advise 
the Sponsor on safety and ethical issues of the study.  The DSMB and Study Chair, 
Medical Monitor and Sponsor Representative will be in charge of reviewing safety 
data. The independent DSMB will be comprised of a total of fiv e members with  at least 
three MDs , a biostatistician  and the DSMB chair .  The DSMB  will meet periodically to 
discuss procedures and review unblinded data related to study status and enrollment, 
adverse events, previous/concomitant medications, hematology, blood pressure, 
relapses and the EDSS scores.  All other serious and non -serious adverse events will 
be documented, managed for each subject including review of the safety data by the 
DSMB and possible study participation termination at the investigator ’s discretion.  
Information on these meetings will be provided per the DSMB Charter. Statistical analyses  required for planned DSMB meetings  will be prepared and disseminated to 
the DSMB members.  The committee will receive unblinded safety data to allow review 
and assessment by treatment group. In addition, the committee will receive unblinded 
efficacy data to perform benefit /risk ratio assessment. Based on  their reviews and 
analyses of safety and efficacy data, the committee shall have the right to advise the  
sponsor to stop the study after any meeting.  
 
MS Relapses  During the Study  
Subjects enrolled into the study will be closely monitored through the study course by 
the Site and Sponsor’s perso nnel as well as by an external i ndependent Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) to ensure subjects’ welfare.  
 
Relapses that occur after study drugs are withdrawn will be assessed  over the 
remainder of the study period and this data will be utilized as part of additional 
sensitivity analysis (described in the sta tistical plan) as long as the subject has not 
withdrawn their consent to be in the trial.  
 
The confirmation of a protocol -defined relapse will be determined by the Independent 
Relapse Adjudication Committee ( IRAP) . The steps for confirming a relapse are a s 
follows:  
 
1. Subject R eported Relapse  
Subjects who experience new or worsening neurologic symptoms are instructed to 
contact the Treating Neurologist within 48 hours of symptom onset. All new or 
worsening neurological events , reported at a visit or over the phone, consistent with 
MS representi ng a clinical relapse as assessed by the subject will be initially reported 
to the Treating Neurolog ist. In paralle l, the Examin ing Neurologist  will also be notified 
to perform additional assessments. U pon the notification to the Treating Neurologist , 
the time and date of suspected subject reported  relapse will be documented in the  
dedicated page  eCRF  (subject reported) by the Treating Neurologist or designee . 
 The following should be recorded in the eCRF (subject reported) by the Treating 
Neurologist  or de signee : 
• Date and time of symptom onset as reported by the subject  
• Symptoms and events reported by the subject (both neurological and non -
neurological) 
• Date of initial contact by subject  
• Time of initial contact by subject  
 

TG1101 -RMS301   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 9 of 140  information.  The IRAP  will, in turn, make the final determination of whether the 
neurol ogical events meet the criteria for a protocol -defined relapse.  
 
Each episode of relapse must be confirmed by the IRAP, based on the neurological 
assessments performed independently by the Treating and/or Examining Neurologist 
by documenting either of the following:  
 
• ≥ 2 points increase on one of the appropriate FS or 1 point on two or more of the appropriate FS.  The change must affect the selected FS (i.e., pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory or visual).  Note, the change in FS 
scores should corres pond to the patient’s symptoms  (e.g. , patient reported 
change in visual acuity should correspond to a change in the vision FS score).  
Episodic spasm, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood change or bladder or bowel 
urgency or incontinence will not suffice to e stablish a relapse; 
• An increase of ≥0.5 points in the EDSS score (unless EDSS score = 0, then an 
increase of at least 1.0 points is required) from the previous clinically stable 
assessment.  
 
MS relapses are defined  as a new or worsening neurological symptoms lasting 
≥24 hours with the absence of fever, injury, infection or adverse reactions to 
medications and accompanied by new neurological findings upon examination by the 
Examining Neurologist.  The symptoms are at tributed to MS and are preceded by 
30 days of stability or improvement in neurological state. The change in EDSS score as 
assessed by the  Examining Neurologist is ≥ 0.5 increase or ≥ 2 points increase on one 
of the appropriate FS or 1 point on two or more of the appropriate FS.  The change 
must affect the selected FS (i.e., pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory 
or visual).  Note, the change in FS scale scores should correspond to the patient’s 
symptoms (e.g. , patient reported change in visual acuity should correspond to a 
change in the vision FS score).  Episodic spasm, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood change or bladder or bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish a 
relapse.  Please note: sexual dysfunction and fatigue will not be scored.  If the 
symptoms occur less than 30 days following the onset of a protocol -defined relapse, it 
should be considered part of the same relapse and would not be treated with IVMP within the protocol.  New or recurrent neurologic symptoms that evolve gradually 
over months should be considered disability progression, not an acute relapse and 
should not be treated with steroids.   
 
The suspected relapse must be reviewed and confirmed by the IRAP; Appendix D.  The 
IRAP will then notify the CRO and Treating Neurologist of the results of its review.  
Treating Neurologist/ designee  will enter into the eCRF whether the neurological 
symptoms identified were a result of a n IRAP- confirmed relapse.  
IRAP- confirmed relapses are the sole confirmation of a protocol -defined relapse . 
However , for instances where IRAP -confirmed relapses may not be feasible, 
provisions are provided within Section 4.4.2 ( Treating Neurologist  medically 
confirmed relapse).  
The subject must re -consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed  or  Treating 
Neurologist medically confirmed relapse to continue.  
 
Signing the informed consent form for re -consent (if the subject  has a confirmed 
relapse), to proceed with the study at the next scheduled office visit  should be within 
6 weeks after first reporting  of relapse.  

TG1101 -RMS301   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 10 of 140   
Re-consent criteria  after relapse  
In case of a n IRAP -confirmed MS relapse (as defined in the protocol, Appendix C) or 
Treating Neurologist  medically confirmed relapse during the study, the following 
actions will be taken:  
• The subject will be reminded of the current approved MS medications/treatments 
and the opportunity to terminate the study and be treated with an approved MS 
medication.  
• The subject will be requested to re- sign an informed consent form  within 6 weeks 
after  first reporting of the suspected relapse if he/she chooses to continue to 
participate in the study, in the same treatment assignment.  
 
Disability Progression  
The method of disability progression calculation will be different than that of the 
relapse confirmation. The EDSS score will be used to assess disability progression . 
EDSS assessment  will be  performed by the Examining Neurologist . The Examining 
Neurologis t must not  share the EDSS score with the Treating Neurologist. T he EDSS 
assessment  for disability progression  will be performed at screening and on Week 1  
Day 1 (prior to randomization) and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96.  To clarify, 
disability  progression is not calculated by the Examining Neurologist (disability 
progression is a  post hoc  analysis  based on the EDSS scores ). 
 
Disability progression is defined as an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS 
score that is not attributable to another etiology (e.g., fever, concurrent illness, or concomitant medication) when the baseline score is 5.5 or less, and ≥0.5 when the baseline score is above 5.5.   Disability progression is considered confirmed when the 
increase in the ED SS is confirmed at regularly scheduled visits at least 12 or 24 weeks 
after the initial documentation of neurological worsening.

TG1101 -RMS301   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 29 of 140  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 BACKGROUND  
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS).  
Although it can occur at any age, it is often seen in young adults between the ages of 20 to 40 with a higher incidence 
in females versus males.  According to the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, over 400,000 people in the United State s 
and approximately 2.5 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with the disease.[1]  Pr ior to 2014 , MS ha d 
been classified into four clinical subtypes: relapsing -remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), 
primary progressive MS (PPMS) and progressive relapsing MS (PRMS). [2]  In 2014, the International Advisory 
Committee on Clinical Trials of MS revised the MS phenotypes to the following disease modifier phenotypes: 
Clinically Isolated S yndrome (CIS; not active or acti ve), RMS (not active or active), progressive disease (active and 
with progression; active but without progression; not active with progression; not active and without 
progression). [3]  The progression, severity and specific symptoms of MS vary amongst each  subjects  and are 
unpredictable.  Since 1993, twelve disease modifying therapies (DMTs) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat MS.  These include 7 injectable  agents , 3 orals and 3 infusions.  The main target in the 
majority of these therapies has been T cells.  Despite improvements in the available therapies in reducing relapses 
by up to 65% [4] and slowing the progression of the disease, subjects  continue to experience disease relapses and 
progression.  Furthermore, some of the T cell directed therapies have shown safety issues that have challenged their 
more widespread use.  Recent immunopathologic and clinical studies have demonstrated that B cells also play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease, perhaps upstream of the T cell mediated pathology .  As such, targeting 
aberrant autoimmune activity in B cells in MS may represent the next leap forward in treating MS.   Phase 2 and 3 
studies with anti -CD20 antibodies, which selectively deplete B cells, have shown robus t efficacy over both placebo 
and B -interferon . To date, B cell targeted therapies have not been approved for the treatment of relapsing and 
progressive forms of MS.  Thus, there is a pressing need for new, innovative, B cell targeted therapies for the 
trea tment of this heterogeneous disease.   
1.2 UBLITUXIMAB  
Ublituximab is a novel third generation chimeric anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody bioengineered for potent activity, 
exhibiting a unique glycosylation profile with a low fucose content, designed to introduce superior antibody -
dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC).  Ublituximab has maintained competitive complement -dependent cytotoxicity 
(CDC) and has also demonstrated to induce programmed cell death (PCD) upon binding to the CD20 antigen on B -
lymphocytes.  Ublituximab  has a unique protein sequence, and targets epitopes on CD20 not targeted by rituximab 
or ofatumumab, both currently approved anti -CD20 antibodies in oncologic diseases and rheumatoid arthritis 
(rituximab only).  
 PRE -CLINICAL EVALUATIONS OF UBLITUXIMAB  
1.2.1.1 IN V ITRO ACTIVITY  
In an in- vitro assay using B -CLL cells from subject  donors, ublituximab demonstrated an enhanced ability to kill CLL 
cells compared to rituximab.  Ublituximab demonstrated improved Fcγ receptor IIIA (FcγRIIIA)/CD16 binding and 
FcγRIIIA dependent effector functions compared to rituximab.  Additionally, ubli tuximab induced higher ADCC 
against CLL cells, and a higher FcγRIIIA mediated interleukin  (IL)-2 production by FcγRIIIA+ Jurkat cells (5).  
Ublituximab demonstrated high ADCC against both subject -derived CLL cells and NHL cell lines. Against the NHL cell 
line Ramos, ublituximab was observed to inhibit the constitutively active NF -κB survival pathway and  induce the 
expression of PTEN along with inhibition of the PI3K -AKT pathway.  Ublituximab also induced the expression of pro -
apoptotic factors, sensitizing Ramos cells to TRAIL mediated apoptosis ( 6).  

TG1101 -RMS301   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 30 of 140  1.2.1.2 IN VIVO ACTIVITY  
The antitumor effect of ublituximab was compared to that of rituximab with chemotherapy in follicular lymphoma 
(FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) xenograft murine models.  Single agent ublituximab demonstrated dose -
related anti -tumor activity with 100% tumor growth inhibition in the FL xenograft at a dose of 100  mg/kg, a nd a 
superior tumor growth delay (21 days) compared to rituximab. Ublituximab also demonstrated superior anti- tumor 
activity compared to rituximab against MCL xenografts at all dose levels ( 7).  
1.2.1.3 TOXICOLOGY  
In single -dose and repeat dose toxicology studies performed under GLP, ublituximab displayed a safety profile 
similar to what might be expected for anti -CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Single administration of up to 100 mg/kg 
ublituximab in cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated, with no local irritation with intravenous administration.  Genotoxicity studies (Ames test) showed that ublituximab  was not mutagenic.  Monkeys that received a single 
injection of 0.3 mg/kg of ublituximab developed an anti -ublituximab response, whereas anti -ublituximab antibodies 
were not detected in the animals which received 10 or 100 mg/kg (see Ublituximab Investigator Brochure).  
 CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF UBLITUXIMAB  
1.2.2.1 PHARMACOKINETICS  
After infusion of ublituximab (previously known as LFB -R603) at 150 mg dose followed by seven weekly infusions 
at 450 mg, results suggested non -linear pharmacokinetics with respect to dos e (450 mg vs . 150 mg) and time ( Week 
4 vs . Week 8); and more than proportional increase of Cmax and AUC∞ due to a clearance decrease.  The volume of 
distribution at steady state was small (~5 L), approximately equal to blood volume.  This non -linear 
pharmacokinetics  may be explained by binding of ublituximab to its target, with a large component of target -
mediated elimination after the first dose that is decreased after subsequent infusions due to a reduction in the available target.  However, limited data for each dose level cohort and considerable variability in baseline subject  
characteristics, particularly in terms of tumor burden, make firm conclusions difficult.  
The linear mean serum concentration -times profile after the first, the fourth and the eight  infusion of ublituximab 
are presented in Figure 1.  A summary of non -compartmental PK parameters after the first, the fourth and the eighth 
infusion of ub lituximab are presented in Table 2.

TG1101 -RMS301   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 32 of 140  compared to placebo at 24 weeks.  More recently, ocrelizumab demonstrated promising results in its 2 Phase III 
trials (OPERA I and OPERA II)  [20] .  In OPERA I  and II, subjects  treated with ocrelizumab had significantly lower 
Annualized Relapse Rates (0.156 and 0.155, respectively) compared to subjects treated with IFNβ -1a, 44µg (0.292 
and 0.29, respectively).  Further, in OPERA I and II, subjects treated with ocrelizumab had approximately 46% 
reduction in  ARR as  compared to those treated with IFNβ -1a 44μg ; TG Therapeutics is powering this study for a 40% 
reduction in ARR. [14]  
 RATIONALE FOR THE T RIAL  
Ublituximab has been studied extensively in the treatment of B- cell malignancies and has been shown to be a potent 
B-cell depleting agent.  Based on the success of other CD20s in the treatment of RMS, ublituximab is being studied in 
RMS.  
TG Therapeutics has performed a phase 2a clinical trial using ublituximab as a single agent to examine the level of B cell depletion by ublituximab as well as determine the optimal dose and infusion time for ublituximab in subjects with RMS.  Based on the results of the Phase 2a study with a dosing of 150 mg (infused for 4 hours) on Week 1 Day  1 
and a dosing of 450 mg (infused for 1 hour) on Week 3 Day 15, a median of >9 9% B cell depletion was achieved on 
Week 4 and sustained until Week 24.  The dosing regimen was well tolerated by the subjects with I nfusion Related 
Reactions (grade 1 and 2) being the commonly reported adverse event.  
TG Therapeutics also performed a phase 1 clinical study using ublituximab as a single agent to examine the safety and tolerab ility of a single dose ublituximab at 450  mg in subjects diagnosed with acute N euromyelitis Optica 
relapse.  Although the single dose of 450 mg ublituximab infused for 4 hours was safe and well tolerated, the study 
demonstrated that after 3 months, B cells  started to replete after being deplete for >99% upon the initial 
administration of ublituximab on Week 1 Day 1.  
In examining the results from both the Phase 2a RMS and Phase 1 acute NMO clinical studies, it is believed that a higher dose of ublituximab wi ll be needed during the initial 6 months of treatment in RMS subjects .  With enhanced 
potency over first generation anti -CD20s due to its glycoengineering, we believe we may be able to optimize the 
therapeutic window and/or safely decrease infusion times, offering subjects  comparable efficacy with a more 
convenient infusion.

3.3 DISCONTINUATION FROM STUDY  TREATMENT 
Subjects  will be discontinued  from trial treatment or withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Irreversible or intolerable toxicity or abnormal laboratory values thought to be related to drug toxicity  
• Subject  requests to withdraw consent or discontinue treatment  
• Pregnancy (see Section 3.3.1)  
• Inability of the subject  to comply with trial requirements  
• Conditions requiring therapeutic intervention not permitted by the protocol  
• Inter -current illness (this will be at the Principal I nvestigator and/or Treating Neurologist discretion)  
• Malignancy  
• Discontinuation of the study by the Sponsor  
After discontinuation  from protocol treatment  all subjects  (other than those who withdraw consent  and refuse to 
enter into the 20 week Follow -up Period ) should  undergo an accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure with 
either oral cholestyramine or oral activated charcoal and be followed for safety  for 20 weeks  after their last dose of 
ublituximab /oral placebo  or teriflunomide /IV placebo .  All new AEs occurr ing during this period must be reported 
and followed until resolution, unless, in the opinion of the PI and/or Treating Neurologist , these values are not likely 
to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case the PI and/or Treating Neurologist must record his or her 
reasoning for this decision in the subjects ’ medical records and as a comment on the electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF).  
All subjects who have Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE;  Ver 4.03)  grade 3 or 4 laboratory 
abnormalities at the time of discontinuation from protocol treatment must be followed until the laboratory values 
have returned to grade 1 or 2, unless it is, in the opinion of the PI and/or Treating Neurologist, not likely that th ese 
values are to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the PI or Treating Neurologist  must record his 
or her reasoning for making this decision in the subjects’ medical records and as a comment on the eCRF.  
Any subject that withdraw s their consent to participate in the study will have all data collection stop on that day and 
will not be followed -up on. These subjects, however, could be followed further if they agree to  sign  the Early 
Termination ICF  and enter the 20 week Follow -up Perio d. 
 PREGNANCY  
During the course of the trial, all female subjects  of childbearing potential (the definitions of “women of childbearing 
potential” are listed in Appendix A ) must contact the PI  and/or Treating Neurologist  immediately if they suspect that 
they may be pregnant (a missed or late menstrual period should also be reported to the PI  and/or Treating 
Neurologist ).   

TG1101 -RMS301   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 37 of 140  If an investigator suspects that a subject  may be pregnant during the study , the trial drugs must be withheld 
immediately , until the result of the pregnancy test is confirmed.  Subjects will proceed with a urine pregnancy test 
immediately. If the urine pregnancy test is positive,  the subject should be informed of the potential teratogenic 
effects, therefore consideration to withhold further teriflunomide/oral placebo dosing shoul d be made and follow -
up appointment should be scheduled as soon as possible where a serum pregnancy test will be performed for 
confirmation.  
If a pregnancy is confirmed  via serum pregnancy test , the trial drugs must be stopped immediately and permanently . 
The subject will complete the Withdrawal from Treatment Visit as soon as possible and will then enter the 20-week 
Follow- up Period  inclusive of accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure with either oral cholestyramine or 
oral activated charcoal.  The  subject will be expected to complete the full Follow -up Period regardless of the outcome 
of the pregnancy.  T he investigator must record the pregnancy on a Pregnancy Report Form within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence  (see Section 9.10.6 for more details on pregnancy reporting) .  
Additionally, if a pregnancy is confirmed, the subject will be asked to sign an  informed consent form  to allow the 
collection of medical information of both the subject and her baby throughout the pregnancy and until 6 month s 
after the baby is born, as permitted by local regulations .  Where required by local regulations, the consent of the 
father will also be obtained.  
If a male subject’s female partner  becomes pregnant and the male subject has taken at least one dose of study 
medications (ublituximab /oral placebo  or teriflunomide /IV placebo ), the pregnancy and newborn will also be 
followed.  In this case, the subject’s partner will be asked to sign an i nformed consent form  to allow the collection of 
medical information of both the mother and baby throughout the pregnancy and until 6 months after the  baby is 
born, as permitted by local regulations .  Where required by local regulations, the consent of the male subject will 
also be obtained. If the mother is younger than legal age, her parent(s)/guardian(s) will also need to give consent, as required by local regulations.   
Prior to discharge from the study, a ll subjects  will be counseled by the treating team to have their teriflunomide 
plasma concentration re -measured prior to attempting to become pregnant or trying to impregnate their female 
partner.   
Confirmed  pregnan cy must be reported to pharmacovigilance.

Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 38 of 140  4 TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 DEFINITION OF STUDY  STAFF  
 AT THE STUDY SITE  
At each study center the staff will consist of a minimum of two neurologists. One neurologist will  be the Treating 
Neurologist  and one will be the E xamining Neurologist for a given subject  throughout the study. An MRI radiologist 
and technologist, and a clinical coordinator, and a pharmacist (or another authorized staff member) must also be 
members of the study staff at  each center. A technician/staff nurse qualified to perform MSQo L54 (inclusive of SF36) 
and FIS  must also be a member of the study staff at each center. When performing a relapse assessment  or disability 
progression , the results from the Treating and Examining Neurologist will not be shared.  
 PRINCIPAL I NVESTIGATOR  
At each investigational center, a neurologist will be appointed to serve as a P rincipal Investigator  and will have 
overall responsibility to lead the site study team (neurologists, radiologists,  technicians,  staff nurses,  pharmacists 
and clinical coordinators)  in all aspects of the study. The Principal Investigator will  oversee the recruitment and 
accrual of appropriate subjects, the conduct of the study according to  the study protocol, and the collection of 
required study data  and regulatory requirements including timely reporting of all SAEs . The P rincipal Investigator  
may  be the Treating Neurologist  for a given subject  but cannot be the Examining Neurologist  (see Sections 4.1.3 and 
4.1.4 for the roles and responsibilities of the Treating Neurologist and Examin ing Neurologist, respect ively ). 
 TREATING N EUROLOGIST 
The Treating Neurologist  will be responsible for subject s’ care, eligibility evaluation, supervision of study  medication 
administration, recording and treating of adverse events, serious adverse event s and assessing and treating of MS 
relapses, performing neurological examinations and  monitoring of safety assessments, including routine laboratory 
results and concomitant  medications. The Treating Neurologist will provide no information to the Examining 
Neurologist. The MSFC and SDMT assessments may be performed by the Treating Neurologist, or may be delegated 
to another qualified team member, but must not be performed by the Examining Neurologist.  The Treating 
Neurologist  (who does not perform the E DSS assessment) , other investigative site staff  and subject  should not have 
access to Examining Neurologist ’s EDSS score s. It is encouraged that  the same physician maintain the role of Treating 
Neurologist  for a given subject  throughout the study.    
 EXAMIN ING N EUROLOGIST (EVALUATING NEUROLOGIST)  
The Examining Neurologist (EDSS Rater) will be responsible for conducting and documenting all EDSS assessments.  
The Examining Neurologist will not share the findings of the EDSS assessment when evaluating relapses with the 
Treating Neurologist. The Examining Neurologist  must possess current EDSS rater certification (Level C) .  
Throughout the study, the Examining Neu rologist  is blinded to all subject information collected by the Treating 
Neurologist which includes adverse events, concomitant medications, laboratory results, and any clinical MS 
examination for enrolled subjects . Additional ly, the Examining Neurologist  should not have access to  any prior EDSS 
scores  from any time throughout the study  or any clinical information when performing their examination.  
 The Examining Neurologist will also be responsible for entering the EDSS assessment data into the electronic Case 
Report Form (eCRF). The entry of EDSS assessment data into eCRF may be delegated to another staff member, provided that the staff member has been trained in the eCRF, maintains the same level of blinding as that of the 
Examining Neurologist  and is not involved in any other study- related activities, other than EDSS  assessments . 
 

TG1101 -RMS301   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 39 of 140  Every effort should be made to ensure that there is no change in the EDSS R ater  throughout the course of the study 
for any individual subject.  Whenever possible, the same person should perform the examination for the full study 
duration. All members of the study staff at the clinical site  and the subject  should  not discuss safety issues with the  
Examining Neurologist .  Subjects will be instructed not to discuss any clinical symptoms or experiences while on 
trial  with the E xamining Neurologist.  The Examining Neurologist should remind the subject at the start of the 
examination to not discuss any clinical symptoms or experiences while on trial.  
 
In exceptional cases, where a site clinical research nurse or a clinical coordinator has neurostatus EDSS rater 
certification level C and extensive experience with EDSS assessments in clinical trials, they may be delegated the 
responsibilities of the Examining Neurologist provided  the required level of blinding is maintained.  Additionally, TG 
Therapeutics’ written approval will be required in advance of such a delegation.  
The Treating Neurologist and the Examining Neurologist will NOT be allowed to switch roles. 
 MRI STAFF  
The MRI staff will be responsible for performing the MRI according to the protocol  and MRI manual. They will also 
prepare adequate electronic material according to the MRI manual for transfer of images to the central MRI reader.  
The MRI manual will provide ins tructions for  storage of the primary data at the site.  
 
Radiologist will review MRI scans locally for non -MS pathology and will provide reports to the Treating Neurologist. 
Local MRI reports after randomization must not contain details of the MS pathology,  MRI scans will be read centrally 
for MS pathology by the central MRI reader.  
 CLINICAL COORDINA TOR  
The clinical coordinator will be responsible for coordinating and assisting all study site staff, including subject scheduling and completion and monitoring of all subjects’ electronic Case Report Forms. He/she will instruct the 
subjects on proper study medication administration , subject  diary adherence , obtain vital signs, collect, process, and 
send all blood and urine samples and requests to the central laboratory.  Additionally, he/she will be responsible for 
administering the subject -reported questionnaires  (MSQoL -54 and FIS)  and coordinating subject’s appointment 
with ot her departments, e.g. ., imaging facility  etc. Some or all of these study -related activities may instead be 
performed by the Treating Neurologist or a qualified technician/staff nurse.  
4.2 STUDY COMMITTEES  
 DATA SAFETY M ONITORING BOARD (DSMB)  
The DSMB will be an independent group of individuals not involved in the study or study sites or have other conflicts  
of interest with the study  and are charge d with  reviewing safety data and conduct of the trial . The independent DSMB 
will be comprised of five members with at least three MDs, a biostatistician , and the DSMB chair.  The responsibilities 
of the DSMB will be described in a DSMB C harter .  The committee will meet periodically , but at least annually  to fulfill 
the duties and obligations outlined in the DSMB Charter.  Minutes of these meetings will be  prepared  as specified in 
the DSMB Charter.  There will be minutes from both an open session which will be transmitted to the S ponsor and  
CRO and minutes of the closed session maintained  by an unblinded DSMB C oordinator from CRO until the study is 
complete, at which point they will be transmitted to the Sponsor and CRO. Statistical analyses  required for the 
planned DSMB meetings will be prepared and disseminated  to the DSMB members. The committee will receive 
unblinded safety data to allow review and assessment by treatment group. In addition, the committee will receive unblinded efficacy data to perform benefit /risk ratio assessment . On the basis of their reviews and analyses of safety 
and efficacy data, the committee shall have the right to advise the sponsor to stop the study after any meeting  for 
efficacy or detrimental effects or futility.  The process and options will be specified in the Charter.

Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 41 of 140  Antiemetic  for Ublituxim ab or IV placebo:  Ublituximab  or IV placebo  is considered to be of low emetogenic 
potential that may be adequately prevented with prochlorperazine.  Other antiemetic  may be used at the discretion 
of the Treating Neurologist/PI  if nausea and/or vomiting is not adequately controlled/prevented.  
Pre-medication prior to infusion with ublituximab  or IV placebo:  Infusion Related Reactions have been reported 
with ublituximab  or IV placebo  with  more profound reactions in subjects with hematologic malignancies.  All 
subjects treated with ublituximab  or IV placebo  require pre -medication 30 –60 minutes prior to each dose of 
ublituximab  or IV placebo  with an antihistamine (diphenhydramine 50 mg  or equivalent ; administered orally ), and 
a corticosteroid (dexamethasone 10 -20 mg  or equivalent ; administered orally ).  
Treatment of IRR: Symptomatic infusion reactions despite pre -medication, may be treated at the discretion of the 
treating physician, including but not limited to: oral acetaminophen 650 mg ( only used for intervention), 
corticosteroids, antihistamines, oxygen and bronchodilators.   
Note: In case the above referenced medications are not available, equivalents can be used at the investigator’s 
discretion. If medications are given intravenously, the IV line used for ublituximab/IV placebo should not be used. If 
needed, please consult the Medical Monitor.  
Antihypertensive Medications: Since infusion related hypotension may occur, the investigator should carefully 
consider withholding anti -hypertensive medication during the 24 hours prior to, and throughout the IV infusion of 
ublituximab or placebo.  
 MS RELAPSE D URING THE S TUDY  
MS Relapses  During the Study  
Subjects enrolled into the study will be closely monitored through the study cours e by the Site and Sponsor’s 
perso nnel as well as by an external independent Data Safety M onitoring Board (DSMB) to ensure subjects’ welfare.  
 Relapses that occur after study drugs are withdrawn will be assessed over the remainder of the study period and this data will be utilized as part of additional sensitivity analysis (described in the statistical plan) as long as the 
subject has not withdrawn their consent to be in the trial.  
 
The confirmation of a protocol -defined relapse will be determined by the  Independent Relapse Adjudication 
Committee (IRAP) . The steps for confirming a relapse are as follows:  
 
1. Subject Reported Relapse  
Subjects who experience new or worsening neurologic symptoms are instructed to contact the Treating Neurologist 
within 48 hours of symptom onset. All new or worsening neurological events, reported at a visit or over the phone, 
consistent with MS representi ng a clinical relapse as assessed by the subject will be initially reported to the Treating 
Neurologist. In parallel, the Examining Neurologist will also be notified to perform additional assessments. Upon the notification to the Treating Neurologist , the time and date of suspected subject reported relapse will be documented 
in the dedicated page eCRF (subject reported) by the Treating Neurologist  or designee . 
 
The following should be recorded in the eCRF (subject reported) by the Treating Neurologist  or de signee : 
• Date and time of symptom onset as reported by the subject  
• Symptoms and events reported by the subject (both neurological and non -neurological) 
• Date of initial contact by subject  
• Time of initial contact by subject  
 Within 7 days of the subject reporting the suspected relapse to the Treating Neurologist, the subject will be scheduled and assessed by both the Treating and Examining Neurologist  independently.  
 
2. Initial Assessment of Relapse by Treating Neurologist and Examining Neurologist  
 

TG1101 -RMS301   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 42 of 140  The Treating Neurologist will perform a neurological and physical examination and safety assessment. The Treating 
Neurologist  or designee  will document in the eCRF the following:  
• Time and date of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Clinical findings of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Review of previously documented concomitant medications and medical history  
• Safety assessment, including vital signs, CBC, B -cell count, lymphocyte counts, fibrinogen, quantitative 
immunoglobulin  
 
Subjects with suspected clinical relapses reported to the Treating Neurologist or designee will be referred to the 
blinded Examining Neurologist who will  use Neurostatus to  assess the EDSS independently of the Treating 
Neurologist.   
 
The Examining Neuro logist or designee will document in the eCRF the following:  
• Date and time of assessment  
• EDSS score  
• FS Scores  
 
In addition, subjects may not begin IV  methylprednisolone (IVMP) treatment of a relapse until the Examining 
Neurologist has completed his/her examination.   
Treatment of relapses may proceed at the discretion of the Treating Neurologist only after the Examining 
Neurologist has completed his/her exam. The Treating Neurol ogist will not know the results of the EDSS  
assessment . When making determination to treat a potential acute relapse the Treating Neurologist can use IVMP 
(1.0 g/day for at least 3 days and can be extended to 5 days) and will not affect the subject eligibility to continue in 
the study.   
 
The subject must re -consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed or  Treating Neurologist medically 
confirmed relapse  to continue.  
 The findings from either the Treating Neurologist and Examining Neurologist will not be shared.  The Examining 
Neurologist must be blinded to the Treating Neurologist’s assessment and vice versa.  
 
Following the completion of assessments by the Treating and Examining Neurologists these results will be sent 
independently to the IRAP.  
 
3. Confirmation of Relapse by IRAP  
All assessments entered into the eCRF from both the Treating Neurologist and the blinded Examining Neurologist, 
will be sent to an  Independent Relapse Adjudication Panel (IRAP). IRAP adjudicates each case based on all available 
data provided for that case and members are not permitted to contact the site or the sponsor for additional information. The IRAP will, in turn, make the final determination of whether the neurological events meet the criteria 
for a protocol -defined relapse.  
 
Each episode of relapse must be confirmed by the IRAP, based on the neurological assessments performed by the Treating and/or Examining Neurologist independently by documenting either of the following:  
 
• ≥ 2 points increase on one of the appropriate FS or 1 point on two or more of the appropriate FS.  The change must affect the selected FS (i.e., pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory or visual).   Note, the 
change in FS scores should correspond to the patient’s symptoms (e.g. , patient reported change in visual 
acuity should correspond to a change in the vision FS score).  Episodic spasm, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, 
mood change or bladder or bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish a relapse ; 
• An increase of ≥0.5 points in the EDSS score (unless EDSS score = 0, then an increase of at least 1.0 points is 
required) f rom the previous clinically stable assessment.  

TG1101 -RMS301   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 43 of 140   
MS relapses are defined as a new or worsening neurological symptoms lasting ≥24 hours with the absence of fever, 
injury, infection or adverse reactions to medications and accompanied by new neurological findings upon 
examination by the E xamining Neurologist.  The symptoms are attributed to MS and are preceded by 30 days of 
stability or improvement in neurological state. The change in EDSS score as assessed by the  Examining Neurologist 
is ≥ 0.5 increase or ≥ 2 points increase on one of the appropriate FS or 1 point on two or more of the appropriate FS.  
The change must affect the selected FS (i.e. , pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory or visual).  Note, 
the change in FS scale scores should corre spond to the patient’s symptoms  (e.g. , patient reported change in visual 
acuity should correspond to a change in the vision FS score).   Episodic spasm, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood 
change or b ladder or bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice t o establish a relapse.  Please note: sexual 
dysfunction and fatigue will not be scored.  If the symptoms occur less than 30 days following the onset of a protocol defined relapse, it should be considered part of the same relapse and would not be treated wi th IVMP within the 
protocol.  New or recurrent neurologic symptoms that evolve gradually over months should be considered disability progression, not an acute relapse and should not be treated with steroids.   
 
The suspected relapse must be reviewed and confirmed by the IRAP; Appendix D. The IRAP will then notify the CRO 
and Treating Neurologist of the results of its review.  
Treating Neurologist  or designee  will enter into the eCRF whether the neurological symptoms identified were a 
result of a n IRAP- confirmed relapse.  
IRAP- confirmed relapses are the sole confirmation of a protocol -defined relapse. However, for instances where 
IRAP- confirmed relapses may not  be feasible, provisions are provided within Section 4.4.2 (Treating Neurologist 
medically confirmed relapse).  
The subject must re-consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed or Treating Neurologist medically 
confirmed relapse to continue. 
 
Signing the inf ormed consent form for re -consent (if the subject  has a confirmed relapse), to proceed with the study 
at the next scheduled office visit should be within 6 weeks after  first reporting  of relapse.  
 TREATING  NEUROLOGIST MEDICALLY CONFIRMED RELAPSE  
In suspected relapse events for which IRAP confirmation is pending, may not be logistically possible , and/or 
complete case profile s for IRAP review are not available, the Treating Neurologist will medically evaluate the 
suspected relapse event.   In these cases, all information from the Treating Neurologist’s medical evaluation should 
still be entered into the eCRF and provided to the IRAP for adjudication .  This is to ensure each suspected relapse is 
documented.   Treating Neurologist medically confirmed re lapses will not be included in the ARR calculation for the 
primary endpoint.  For any relapse that is Treating Neurologist  medically confirmed, subjects should re -consent to 
continue participation in the trial.   
 RE-CONSENT CRITERIA AFTER RELAPSING 
If a relapse is confirmed by IRAP and/ or deemed a Treating Neurologist  medically  confirmed  relapse , the following 
actions will be taken:  
• The subject will be reminded of the current approved MS medications/treatments and the opportunity to 
terminate the study and be treated with an approved MS medication.  
• The subject will be requested to re -sign an informed consent form within 6 weeks after first reporting of the 
suspected relapse if he/she chooses to continue to participate in the study, in the same treatment assi gnment.

 obtained if a female subject of childbearing potential withdraws from treatment early or has 
an Unscheduled R elapse Visit. Serum pregnancy test may be performed at any time during 
the study in case of a missed or late menstrual cycle.  
4. Urine pregnancy test will be performed on a monthly basis , inclusive of the 2 0 week Follow -
up Period . During study visits urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the site and on days 
of ublituximab or IV placebo infusion urine pregnancy tests will be performed prior to 
infusion. Post Week 24, urine pregnancy test will be administered every 4 weeks  (+/- 5 days), 
unless serum testing is conducted instead . On days when there is not a study visit, the subject 
will need to perform at home and provide the  outcome to the study staff at the study site.  If a 
urine pregnancy test is positive, the subject should be informed of the potential teratogenic effects, therefore consideration to withhold further teriflunomide/oral placebo dosing 
should be made and a follow -up appointment should be scheduled as soon as possible where 
a serum pregnant test will be performed for confirmation.   
5. PT/INR should be drawn on Week 1 Day 1 prior to study medications  administration . This is 
the only time PT/INR will be drawn.  
6. Quantitative immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, IgA) test should be analyzed on Week 1 Day 1 (pre -
dose) and Week  3 Day 15 ( pre-dose ), Weeks 24 (pre -dose) , 48 (pre -dose), 72 (pre- dose) and 
96.  Additionally, q uantitative immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, IgA) test  will be analyzed for 
subjects who withdraw  from treatment early or ha ve an Unscheduled R elapse Visit. 
7. Fibrinogen tests  
a. All subjects will have 5 serum samples taken prior to the infusions on Week 1 Day 1, 
Week 3 Day  15 and Weeks 24, 48, and 72. Additional ly, fibrinogen will be analyzed 
for subjects who withdraw from treatment early or have an Unscheduled R elapse 
Visit. 
8. Anti -Drug Antibody (antibodies developed against ublituximab; Central Lab)  
a. All subjects will have 6 serum samples taken to assess for the presence of ADA prior 
to the infusions on Week 1 Day 1, Week 3 Day 15 and Weeks 24, 48, and 72. In 
addition, a serum sample will be taken at Week 96.  
 
a. Serum s amples will be drawn from all subjects pre- infusion  any time on infusion days  
of ublituximab or IV placebo and at 30 minutes +/- 15 minutes post infusion  on 
infusion days  ( Week 1 Day 1, Week 3 Day 15, Weeks 24, 48, and 72 ). One additional 
serum sample will be taken on Week 96.

10. Plasma concentration for teriflunomide  
a. In order to assess teriflunomide compliance, f our plasma samples will be taken from 
all subjects. The first sample will be taken prior to oral ad ministration  of 
teriflunomide or oral placebo  on Week 1 Day  1. The second sample will be taken prior 
to infusion of ublituximab  or IV placebo on Week 48. The third sample will be taken 
at Week 96, prior to first dose of accelerated teriflunomide eliminatio n procedure 
which begins at Week 100 . The last plasma sample for teriflunomide will be taken at 
Week 116 following the accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure with either 
active charcoal or cholestyramine. For subjects who withdraw from treatment e arly, 
a blood sample will be collected at the Early Withdrawal from Treatment V isit prior 
to first dose of accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure .  
b. Only plasma samples from subjects treated with teriflunomide will be analyzed for 
plasma teriflunomide concentrations.  See the Laboratory Manual for PK collection 
and processing instructions.  
11. Liver function panel: SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, serum gamma -glutamyl transferase (SGGT), 
total bilirubin, direct/indirect bilirubin .  Samples will be taken for  analysis as directed in the 
schedule of assessment (Tables  5, 6, and 7) and as shown in bullet number 2 (Serum 
Chemistry)  
12. Pancreatic enzyme panel: serum amylase and lipase. Samples will be taken for analysis as 
directed in the schedule of assessment (Tabl es 5, 6, and 7) and as shown in bullet number 2 
(Serum Chemistry)  
13. Urinalysis panel for routine safety  will be sampled as follows at screening, and Week 1 Day 1

36, 48 (pre- dose)  60, 72 (pre- dose), 84, 96, 100 and 104. The urine is to be analyzed  for the 
following  pH, ketones, protein, glucose, blood, urobilinogen, bilirubin, microscopic sediment, 
specific gravity  and leucocyte esterase. Additionally, a sample shou ld be obtained for subjects 
who withdraw from treatment early or have an Unscheduled R elapse Visit. 
14. B lymphocyte cell counts (% CD19+ B cells).  Samples will be taken for analysis at screening , 
and Week 1 Day 1 (pre- dose), Day 2, Day 8, Week 3 Day 15 (pre- dose), and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 
16, 20, 24  (pre -dose), 36, 48 (pre- dose)  60, 72 (pre- dose), 84, 96, 100 and 104 . Additionally, 
B lymphocyte cell counts will be analyzed for subjects who withdraw from tre atment early 
or have an Unscheduled R elapse Visit.

 Note, the study site staff will remain blinded to the results of the  PK, ADA and teriflunomide 
concentration analysis for all subjects.  The study site staff will also remain blinded to the results 
of the B lymphocyte cell counts (% CD19+ B cells) from Week 1 Day 1 onwards.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.3 CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND PROCEDURES  
In addition to being a double -blind, double -dummy study, this study is also an  assessor blinded study.  
Each site will have 2 neurologists : Treating Neurologist (can be the PI ) and an Examining N eurologist.  
Please refer to Section 4.1 for definition and responsibility f or each neurologist.  The Examining 
Neurologist will be blinded to subject randomization.   
 ASSESSMENT OF R ELAPSE  
MS Relapses  During the Study  
Subjects enrolled into the study will be closely monitored through the study course by the Site and 
Sponsor’s perso nnel as well as by an external i ndependent Data Safety M onitoring Board (DSMB) to 
ensure subjects’ welfare.  
 
Relapses that occur after study drugs are withdrawn will be assessed over the remainder of the 
study period and this data will be utilized as part of additional sensitivity analysis (described in 
the statistical plan) as long as the subject has not withdrawn their consent to be in the trial.  
 
The confirmation of a protocol- defined relapse will be determined by the  Independent Relapse 
Adjudication Committee ( IRAP) . The steps for confirming a relapse are as follows:  
 
1. Subject Reported Relapse  
Subjects who experience new or worsening neurologic symptoms are instructed to cont act the 
Treating Neurologist within 48 hours of symptom onset. All new or worsening neurological events, 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 59 of 140 
 reported at a visit or over the phone, consistent with MS representing a clinical relapse as assessed 
by the subject will be initially reported to the Treating Neurologist. In parallel, the Examining 
Neurologist will also be notified to perform additional assessments. Upon the notification to the 
Treating Neurologist; the time and date of suspected subject reported relapse will be documented in 
the dedicated page eCRF (subject reported) by the Treating Neurologist  or designee . 
 The following should be recorded in the eCRF (subject reported) by the Treating Neurologist  or 
designee : 
• Date and time of symptom onset as reported by the subject  
• Symptoms and events reported by the subject (both neurological and non -neurological) 
• Date of initial contact by subject  
• Time of initial contact by subject . 
 
Within 7 days of the subject reporting the suspected relapse to the Treating Neurologist, the subject 
will be scheduled and assessed by both the Treating and Examining Neurologist  independently.  
 
2. Initial Assessment of Relapse by Treating Neurologist and Examining Neurologist  
 
The Treating Neurologist will perform a neurological and physical examination and safety 
assessment. The Treating Neurologist or designee will document in the eCRF the following:  
• Time and date of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Clinical findings of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Review of previously documented concomitant medications and medical history  
• Safety assessment, including vital signs, CBC, B -cell count, lymphocyte counts, fibrinogen, 
quantitative immunoglobulin .  
 
Subject s with suspected clinical relapses reported to the Treating Neurologist or designee will be 
referred to the blinded Examining Neurologist who will use Neurostatus to  assess the EDSS 
independently of the Treating Neurologist.   
 
The Examining Neurologist or  designee will document in the eCRF the following:  
• Date and time of assessment  
• EDSS score  
• FS Scores . 
 In addition, subjects may not begin IV  methylprednisolone (IVMP) treatment of a relapse until the 
Examining Neurologist has completed his/her examination .  
 Treatment of relapses may proceed at the discretion of the Treating Neurologist only after the 
Examining Neurologist has completed his/her exam. The Treating Neurologist will not know 
the results of the EDSS assessment . When making determination to tre at a potential acute relapse 
the Treating Neurologist can use IVMP (1.0 g/day for at least 3 days and can be extended to 5 days) 
and will not affect the subject eligibility to continue in the study.   
 
The subject must re -consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed or Treating Neurologist 
medically confirmed relapse to continue.  
 
The findings from either the Treating Neurologist and Examining Neurologist will not be shared.  The 
Examining Neurologist must be blinded to the Treating Neurologist’s assessment and vice versa.  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 60 of 140 
  
Following the completion of assessments by the Treating and Examining Neurologists these results 
will be sent independently to the IRAP.  
 
3. Confirmation of Relapse by IRAP  
All assessments entered into the eCRF from both the Treating Neurologist and the blinded Examining 
Neurologist, will be sent to an Independent Relapse Adjudication Panel (IRAP). IRAP adjudicates each 
case based on all available data provided for that case and members are not permitted to contact the 
site or the sponsor for additional information.   The IRAP will, in turn, make the final determination 
of whether the neurological events meet the criteria for a protocol -defined relapse.  
 
Each episode of relapse must be confirmed by the IRAP, based on the neurological assessments 
performed by the Treating and/or Examining Neurologist  independently by documenting either of 
the following:  
 
• ≥ 2 points increase on one of the appropriate FS or 1 point on two or more of the appropriate 
FS.  The change must affect the selected FS (i.e., pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, 
sensory or visual).   Note, the change in FS scores should correspond to the patient’s 
symptoms (e.g. , patient reported chang e in visual acuity should correspond to a change in the 
vision FS score).  Episodic spasm, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood change or b ladder or 
bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish a relapse ; 
• An increase of ≥0.5 points in the EDSS score (unless EDSS score = 0, then an increase of at 
least 1.0 points is required) from the previous clinically stable assessment.  
 
MS relapses are defined  as a new or worsening neurological symptoms lasting ≥24 hours with the 
absence of fever, injury, infection or adverse reactions to medications and accompanied by new 
neurological findings upon examination by the E xamining Neurologist.  The symptoms are attributed 
to MS and are preceded by 30 days of stability or improvement in neurological state. The change in EDSS score as assessed by the  Examining Neurologist is ≥ 0.5 increase or ≥ 2 points increase on one 
of the appropria te FS or 1 point on two or more of the appropriate FS.  The change must affect the 
selected FS (i.e. , pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory or visual).  Note, the change 
in FS scores should correspond to the patient’s symptoms  (e.g. , patien t reported change in visual 
acuity should correspond to a change in the vision FS score).  Episodic spasm, sexual dysfunction, 
fatigue, mood change or bladder or bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish a 
relapse.  Please note: sexual dy sfunction and fatigue will not be scored.  If the symptoms occur less 
than 30 days following the onset of a protocol defined relapse, it should be considered part of the same relapse and would not be treated with IVMP within the protocol.  New or recurrent  neurologic 
symptoms that evolve gradually over months should be considered disability progression, not an acute relapse and should not be treated with steroids.   
 
The suspected relapse must be reviewed and confirmed by the IRAP; Appendix D. The IRAP will then 
notify the CRO and Treating Neurologist of the results of its review.  
Treating Neurologist/ designee  will enter into the eCRF whether the neurological symptoms 
identified were a result of a n IRAP -confirmed relapse.  
IRAP- confirmed relapses are the sole confirmation of a protocol -defined relapse. However, for 
instances where IRAP -confirmed relapses may not  be feasible, provisions are provided within 
Section 4.4.2 (Treating Neurologist medically confirmed relapse).  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 61 of 140 
 The subject must re -consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed  or Treating Neurologist 
medically confirmed relapse to continue.  
 
Signing the informed consent form for re -consent (if the subject  has a confirmed relapse), to proceed 
with the study at the next scheduled office visit should be within 6 weeks after first reporting  of 
relapse.  
 Treating Neurologist  Medically Reported Relapse  
In suspected relapse events for which IRAP confirmation is pending, may not be logistically possible 
and/or complete case profiles for IRAP review are not available, the Treating Neurologist will 
medically evaluate the relapse event .  In these cases, all information from the Treating Neurologist’s 
medical evaluation should still be entered into the eCRF and provided to the IRAP for adjudication.  
This is to ensure each suspected relapse is documented.   Treating Neurologist medica lly confirmed 
relapses will not be included in the ARR  calculation for the primary endpoint.  
For any relapse that is Treating Neurologist  medically confirmed, subjects should re -consent to 
continue participation in the trial.  
Re-consent criteria  
In case of an IRAP -confirmed relapse (as defined in the protocol, Appendix C) or  Treating Neurologist  
medically confirmed relapse  during the study, the following actions will be taken:  
• The subject will be reminded of the current approved MS medications/treatments and the 
opportunity to terminate the study and be treated with an approved MS medication.  
• The subject will be requested to re- sign an informed consent form within 6 weeks of first 
reporting of the suspected relapse if he/she chooses to continue to p articipate in the study, in the 
same treatment assignment.  
 
Re-consenting may occur at the next scheduled office visit, but may require an unscheduled visit if 
the relapse occurs between Weeks 24 and 96 (where the frequency of scheduled visits is every 12 
weeks).  
 DISABILITY  EVALUATION  
Disability Progression  
The method of disability progression calculation will be different than that of the relapsed 
confirmation. The EDSS score  will be  used to assess disability progression . EDSS assessment will be  
performed by the Examining Neurologist . The Examining Neurologist  must not share  the EDSS score  
with the Treating Neurologist. The EDSS assessment for disability progression  will be performed at 
screening and on Week 1 Day 1 (prior to randomization) and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96. 
Disability progression is a post hoc analysis only and will not be calculated by the Evaluating 
Neurologist or other study staff . 
The EDSS is based on a standard neurological examination, incorporating the following function 
systems ( pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, and cerebral) and 
ambulation rated and scores as function system scores (FS).   Each FS score is an ordinal clinical rating 
scale ranging from 0 to 5 or 6.  These ratings are then used in conjunction with observations and 
information con cerning ambulation and used of assistive devices to determine the EDSS score.   The 
EDSS is a disability scale that ranges in 0.5 -point steps from 0 (normal) to 10 (death).  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 62 of 140 
 The randomization process must ensure that the baseline EDSS is assessed  for the sub ject by the 
Examining Neurologist and is documented  before treatment is assigned.  
Disability progression can only be assessed from the EDSS scores performed at baseline and on Week 
1 Day 1 and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96.  
 
Disability progressio n is defined as an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score that is not 
attributable to another etiology (e.g., fever, concurrent illness, or concomitant medication) when the 
baseline score is 5.5 or less, and ≥0.5 when the baseline score is abo ve 5.5.   
Disability progression is considered confirmed when the increase in the EDSS score is confirmed at 
regularly scheduled visits at least 12 or  24 weeks after the initial documentation of neurological 
worsening.   
 
 RADIOLOGICAL EVALUATION  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a useful tool for monitoring CNS lesions in MS.  Different MRI 
derived parameters  have been related to clinical activity and T1 weighted  gadolinium- enhancing 
lesions or new and/or enlarging hyperintense T2 lesions have been related to relapses.  It is hypothesized that changes in brain volume may reflect brain atrophy as a result of MS -related tissue 
loss and may thereby correlate with long -term clinical outcomes in RMS subjects.  
Brain MRI scans will be obtained in all subjects as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments in S ection 
6. In addition, brain MRI scans will be obtained in subjects who had withdrawn from the trial.  Scans 
will be performed by trained and certified MRI technicians.   
Assessment of effect on Gd enhan cing lesion and new , enlarging T2 lesions, brain volume, T1 
hypointense  will be evaluated as outlined in the schedule of events  by a central reader.  The following 
time windows apply:  
• “Baseline” MRI should be performed after informed consent is obtained , but preferably 10 days 
prior to the Week  1 Day 1  visit.  
• MRI a re scheduled as follows:  Weeks 12  (+/- 7 days) , 24 (pre -dose; - 7 days), 48  (pre -dose; - 7 
days)  and 96 (+/- 7 days)   
• MRI scans may be performed on the day of withdrawal or  within 4 weeks after wi thdrawing from 
the study . 
o The MRI may not be needed if an MRI was obtained within 30 days prior to withdrawal from the trial .  
If subjects receive corticosteroids for a relapse, every effort should be made to obtain the scan prior 
to the first steroid dose if the pre -steroid scan is within 1 week of the scheduled visit.  In subjects 
receiving corticosteroids, there should be an in terval of at least 30 days between the last dose of 
corticosteroids and the scan . 
At each time point, the MRI will include acquisition of scans with and without intravenously 
administered gadolinium contrast enhancement.  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 63 of 140 
 MRI scans will be read by a central ized reading center located in Montreal, Canada for efficacy 
endpoints.  The centralized reading center is blinded to the treatment assignment and the reading is 
performed in the absence of clinical information.  Additional details on scanning acquisition sequences, methods, handling and transmission of the scans, certification of site MRI 
radiologists/technicians, and the procedure for the blinded  analysis of the scans at the central 
reading center will be described in a separate MRI Manual.  
All MRI scans will also be reviewed locally by a radiologist for safety (identify any new clinical 
relevant abnormal MRI findings that are not consistent with the diagnosis of MS, with particular attention to the possibility of progressive multifocal leuko encephalopathy) and the MRI report  will 
be provided to the Treating Neurologist /PI.  After randomization, the MRI reports provided to the 
Treating Neurologist/PI will contain only non -MS pathology .  At the investigational site, only the 
local radiologist/ technician assigned to this study may have access to the MRI scan  post -
randomization ; the Treating Neurologist should not review the MRI scans unless a safety 
concern arises .   
 NEUROLOGICAL EVALUATION  
Assessment of effect on relapse rate will be evaluated as outlined in the schedule of events  (see Study 
Evaluation Tables 5, 6, and 7 and Appendix F ).  EDSS score will be calculated  via Neuro status as stated 
in Sections 6.3.1. and 6.3.2. 
Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite  (MSFC) score will be assessed as outline d in the schedule of 
events (see Study Evaluation Tables 5, 6, and 7 and Appendix F ).  The MSFC consists of three 
subscales, including the 9 -hole- peg test, P aced Auditory Serial Addition T est (PASAT) and T imed 25 -
Foot Walk (T25FW), which provide a global quantitative estimate of MS progression. The MSFC 
assessments may be performed by the Treating Neurologist, or may be delegated to another qualified 
team member, but must not be performed by the Examining Neurologist . 
EDSS will be assessed by the Examining Neurologist. T he results of the EDSS assessment by the 
Examining Neurologist will not be shared with the Treating Neurologist and the PI. 
 
 COGNITION ASSESSMENT  
The Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT) has demonstrated sensitivity in detecting not only the presence of cognitive impairment, but also changes in cognitive functioning over time and in 
response to treatment.  The SDMT is brief, easy to administer verbally and  involves a simple 
substitution task that normal ch ildren and adults can perform.  Using a reference key, the examinee 
has 90 seconds to pair specific numbers with given geometric figures.  Responses will be done 
verbally .  The administration time is approximately 5 minutes.  
The SDMT will be administered verbally by the Treating Neurologist at the time points indicated  in 
the Study Evaluation Tables 5, 6, and 7 and Appendix F. The SDMT assessments may be delegated to 
another qualified team member, but must not be performed by the Examining Neurologist.  
 SUBJECT REPORTED OUTCOMES  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 64 of 140 
 Assessment of effect on MSQo L54 (inclusive of SF36)  and FIS  will be evaluated as outlined in the  
Study Evaluation Tables 5, 6, and 7 and Appendix F  by a qualified coordinator or member of the study 
site.  This will be  done prior to each infusion . 
 
MSQo L54 (inclusive of SF36)  is a multidimensional health -related quality of life measurement that 
combined  generic and MS specific items into a single assessment.   The 54 -item instrument generates 
12 subscales along with 2 su mmary scores and 2 additional single -item measures.  The subscales are 
physical function, role limitations- physical, role limitations -emotional, pain, emotional well- being, 
energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, o verall quality of life 
and sexual function.  The summary s core as are the physical health composite and mental health 
composite.  The single item measure is  satisfaction with sexual function and change in health.   The 
MSQo L54 will be performed at  Week 1 Day 1  (prior to dosing of study medications) , Weeks 24  (pre -
dose) , 48 (pre -dose)  and 96 or Early Withdrawal from Treatment  Visit . 
The Fatigue Impact S cale  (FIS)  is a detailed tool, which takes ~ 3 minutes to complete.  The subject 
completes the tool personally, rather than having an interview.  The score reflects functional 
limitation due to fatigue experienced within the previous  assessment rathe r than a measure of the 
level of  fatigue.  There are 40 items, each of which is scored 0 (no problem) to 4 (extrem e problem), 
providing a continuous scale of 0 – 160.  It is composed of three subscales that describe how fatigue 
impacts cognition, physicality and psychosocial functions.  The cognitive function includes concentration, memory, thinking and organization o f thoughts.  Physical function reflects motivation, 
effort, stamina and coordination.  Psychosocial function includes the impact of fatigue on isolation, emotions, workload and coping. The FIS assessment will be performed at Week 1 Day 1  (prior to 
dosing o f study medications), Weeks 24 (pre- dose), 48 (pre- dose) and 96 or Early Withdrawal from 
Treatment  Visit .

Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment  (Week 1 Day 1)  until the crite ria for relapse 
or progression of disease are met or there is evidence of new radiological activity as assessed by MRI, 
taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, includ ing the 
baseline measurements.  
6.8 RESPONSE REVIE W 
Subjects will be assessed for relapse by the Treating Neurologist  at screening, baseline (pre -dose) , 
and all scheduled visits and, if necessary, at unscheduled visits.  If a relapse is suspected, the Treating 
Neurologist and Examining Neurologist will follow the procedures as outlined in Section 6.3.1.  
MS relapses are defined  as new or worsening  neurological  symptom s lasting ≥24 hours with the 
absence of fever , injury, in fection or adverse reactions to medications . The symptoms are attributed 
to MS and are preceded by 30  days of stability. The change in EDSS score as assessed by the  
Examining Neurologist  is ≥ 0.5 increase from prior visit  or ≥ 2 point s increase on one of t he 
appropriate FS or 1 point on two or more of the appropriate FS.   
6.9 RE-SCREENING PROCEDURES  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 66 of 140 
 Subjects may be re -screened under the following conditions:  
 
• After a relapse recovery (see Section 4.4.1 ) and upon re -consent  
• Varicella titer does not indicate immunity at initial screening and subject is re -immunized 
(see Section 3.2)  
• He/she, at initial screening, is not eligible to participate in the study based on 
inclusion/exclusion criteria ( Sections 3.1 and 3.2) and wishes to re -assess eligibility after a 
waiting period deemed sufficient by the site investigator.  
• The subject was determined  eligible, but 28 days or more has elapsed between the initial 
screen and the first infusion ( Week 1 Day 1).  
 Re-screening procedures are identical to initial screening procedures (Appendix F ), but with the 
following modifications:  
• Medical history does not need to be taken again.  
• Screening MRI may not  need to  be repeated  if there was one obtained within 30 days  prior to 
this screening  
6.10  END OF S TUDY FOLLOW -UP 
After early termination of trial or at the end of study visit at Week 96, subjects will enter a 20 -week  
Follow- up Period inclusive of the accelerated elimination of teriflunomide .  The 11 -day elimination 
procedure will commence at Week 100 for all subjects who completed all study visits including Week 
96.  For those subjects who had terminated early (discontinued or withdrawn from the study), the 11-day elimination procedure will commence  the day after the Early Withdrawal from Treatment 
Visit.  The follow up period  will include  visits at W eeks 100 , 104, and 116.  Weeks 108 and 112 will 
be perform ed via a phone call.   
 For subjects who withdraw their consent to participate in the study, t he site should inform these 
subjects of the 20 -week  Follow- up Period inclusive of the accelerated teriflunomide elimination 
procedure and document this in the eCRF . Participation  in the 20 -week Follow -up Period inclusive 
of the accelerated teriflunomide elimination  procedure for subjects who withdraw  early is left to the 
discretion  of the subject. If he/she elects not to participate in the 20 -week  Follow -up inclusive of the  
accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure , after w ithdrawing consent and after discussion 
with the site, it should be documented in the eCRF.  
 
For subjects who will participate in the 20 -week Follow- up Period inclusive of the accelerated 
teriflunomide elimination procedure after withdrawing consent for this study, a new consent form 
to participate in the 20 -week Follow- up Period inclusive of the accelerated teriflunomide elimination 
procedure will need to be signed. If he/she re -consents, the sites will complete the eCRF for Weeks 
100, 104, 108, 112, and 116 , accordingly .  
 The purpose of this follow -up is to monitor safety and relapses after the discontinuation of study 
medications and to eliminate residual teriflunomide  from the study subjects.  Because blinding is 
maintained until the data from the treatment period (through Week 96)  is locked , all subjects will 
undergo the accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure regardless of whether they were 
randomized to ublituximab /oral placebo  or teriflunomide /IV placebo .  Study subjects that enter the 
Follow- up Period  of TG1101 -RMS301  (post -Week 96 to Week 116) are not allowed to receive DMTs.  
Please refer to the exclusion criteria of the protocol for a list of MS therapies (Section 3.2).  It should be noted that u se of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of a relapse  is allowed .  Whe n deciding 

TG1101 -RMS301

• Physical exam inatio n and vital signs  
• Urine pregnancy test  
• Report concomitant medications and Adverse Events  
• Hematology and serum c hemistry, urinalysis, and B cell assays  (as per Section 6)  
• Acknowledgment of the completion of teriflunomide rapid elimination program  by the site 
on eCRF  
 
Week 108  and 112  (Phone Call) : 
• Follow- up phone call to subject to collect information on concomitant medications , Adverse 
Events  and urine pregnancy test outcomes  
 
Week 116 Visit  (Final Visit) : 
• Physical exam ination  and vital signs  
• Urine pregnancy  test 
• Report concomitant medications and Adverse Events  
• Teriflunomide drug concentration test : Draw blood to test teriflunomide plasma 
concentration  
 
TG1101 -RMS303 is a 1 72-week open label extension (OLE) trial. S ubjects complet ing 96 -weeks of 
treatment in TG1101 -RMS301 or TG1101 -RMS302 trials in United States, Croatia, Ukraine, Russia, 
Republic of Belarus, Serbia, Poland, and Georgia may be eligible to participate.  Regardless of which 
treatment group the subject was assigned to in the core study, all subjects enrolled in the OLE will 
receive ublituximab on the following schedule:  Week 1 Day 1, Week 3 Day 15, and Weeks 24, 48, 72, 
96, 120, 144, and 168  or until physician or subject decision to withdraw prior to th is time.   Subjects 
will have final assessments done at Week 172. TG1101 -RMS301 is considered a core study protocol 
for OLE. The TG1101 -RMS303 subjects, sponsor and investigators will not know TG1101 -RMS301 
and TG1101 -RMS302 treatment assignments until the se studies are unblinded.  
 ACCELERATED TERIFLUNOMIDE  ELIMINATION PROCEDURE  
All subjects should undergo the 11 -day accelerated teriflunomide e limination procedure during the 
Follow- up Period: O ral cholestyramine 8 g is administered three times per day  for 11 days.  If subjects 
do not tolerate this regimen, then the dosage may be reduced to 4  g three times per day .   
 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 68 of 140 
 If tolerability issues persist, cholestyramine administration does not need to occur on consecutive  
days unless there is an acute need to  lower teriflunomide levels.   
 
As an alternative to cholestyramine, o ral activated charcoal administered as 50 g twice  a day  for 11 
days may be used .  
 
It needs to be documented in the eCRF which elimination treatment was used.  
 
Plasma will be drawn at Week 116  to determine the concentration of  teriflunomide . However, 
results will not be shared with the site or subject to maintain blinding .  Prior to discharge from the 
study , all subjects  will be counseled by the  treating team to have their  teriflunomide plasma 
concentration re -measured prior to attempting to become pregnant or trying to impregnate a 
female partner.

7.3 ORDERING STUDY MEDICATIONS  
Once the clinical trial site receives both IRB/ EC and Regulatory Authorities  approval, the Sponsor’s 
or its designee will  perform the Site Initiation Visit and inspection of pharmacy. Following completion 
of these tasks the site can then be officially open  and an automatic shipment of pre- determined 
quantity of all study medication  (ublituximab, teriflunomide, IV placebo and oral placebo ) and 
treatment supplies (i.e., normal saline, infusion kit, cholestyramine, activated charcoal)  will be 
shipped to the clinical trial site , accordingly .  A separate Drug Distribution Plan will detail country 
variances and specifics.  
Upon receipt of study m edication and treatment supplies, the Pharmacist or the appropriate person 
of the site should update the accountability forms.  
If any abnormality on the s hipment invoice compared to what was actually shipped  is observed, the 
Pharmacist or the appropriate person must document that on the acknowledgement of receipt and contact th e CRO . 
7.4 BLINDING, PACKAGING AND L ABELING

Each tablet of teriflunomide (14 mg) or oral placebo is  a white to off white, round -film -coated tablet 
with the d ose strength “14” engraved on one side and engraved with a “B” on the other side.  
 
Teriflunomide  or oral placebo  will be supplied to the subject in a box containing 28 tablets ( composed 
of 2 folded blister cards of 14 tablets per blister card  as a wallet). Four (4)  boxes will be supplied to 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 73 of 140 
 the subject every 12 weeks. The packaging of the teriflunomide or oral placebo in the blister pack 
will be child resistant.  
 
Therefore , to assist in drug accountability for the site,  the subjects  over 12 weeks should have 
recei ved 112 tablets and when returning back to the sites in approximately 12 weeks; approximately 
84 tablets should have been taken and approximately 28 tablets should be returned to the site. 
Approximately every 12 weeks, the site must c ollect all unused teriflunomide or oral placebo tablets.  
 
New boxes of teriflunomide or oral placebo will be provided to the subject. The study side will not 
re-dispense previously unused tablets back to the subject. These tablets should be quarantined unt il 
the study monitor can inventory them and instruct the site on destruction of them.  
 
The box of teriflunomide  or oral placebo dispensed to the subject will be labeled in compliance with 
the applicable regulatory regulations in that country.  
 UBLITUXIMAB  OR I V PLACEBO 
Ublituximab  or IV placebo is provided to the study site  in unit boxes. Each unit box contains one 15 
mL vial (10  mg/mL) or one 6 mL vial (25 mg/mL) solution of ublituximab or IV placebo. The 
container closure system for the vials containing 15 mL is a Type I plus borosilicate vial closed by a 
siliconized bromobutyl rubber stopper sealed with an aqua  plastic and aluminum cap  and t he 
container closure system for the vials containing 6 mL is a type  I glass vial closed by a siliconized  
chlorobutyl rubber stopper sealed with a  white  plastic  and aluminum cap.  
The empty vials should be maintained until the study monitor performs reconciliation.  
The bo x of ublituximab or IV placebo provided to the study site will be labeled in compliance with 
the applicable regulatory regulations in that country.  
7.5 DISPENSING  AND ADMINISTRATION  
The exact dose and the date and time of administration of ublituximab /oral placebo  or 
teriflunomide /IV placebo  must be recorded within the e CRF, subject ’s medical records, and in the 
drug accountability records.  
The Pharmacist or his/her representative should record the date dispensed and subject ’s number 
and initials on the labels. He/she should complete the accountability forms with information concerning the dispensation of ublituximab /oral placebo and teriflun omide/ IV placebo .  
 DISPENSING  AND ADMINISTRATION  OF TERIFLUNOMIDE  OR ORAL PLACEBO 
Teriflunomide  or oral placebo will be dispensed every 12 weeks to the subject  (see Section 7.3  for 
further details).  
7.5.1.1 GUIDELINES FOR ORAL TREATMENT OF TERIFLUNOMIDE OR ORAL P LACEBO

necessary to provide adequate emergency treatment.  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 74 of 140 
 • Subjects  who withdr aw from treatment  should  be followed up for 20 weeks inclusive of the  
11-day accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure , during which they receive 
cholestyramine or activated  charcoal . 
• If a pregnancy is confirmed, the trial drug(s) must be immediately and permanently stopped, 
the subject  must be discontinued from the trial, an d the Treating Neurologist  must report this 
to pharmacoviligance as soon as possible.  Further, the subject needs to undergo immediate 
accelerated washout with either oral cholestyramine or oral activated charcoal and be followed for AEs for 20 weeks  after  their last dose of the trial drug  (please see Section 6.10.1) .
 
• Teriflunomide  or oral placebo  shall  be taken each in the morning daily until the last day of 
Week 95. Alternative dosing times are allowed if necessary.  
o On Week 1 Day 1, teriflunomide or oral placebo  dosing should occur upon completion of 
infusion.  If vomiting occurs during the  infusion  of ublituximab or IV placebo , refrain from 
administering terifluno mide  or oral placebo  on Week 1 Day 1. The first dose of 
teriflunomide or oral placebo will be administered on Week 1 Day 2 . 
• Compliance to administration of teriflunomide  or oral placebo  
o Plasma samples to determine the concentration of teriflunomide will be obtained 
from all subjects at the following time -points: Week 1 Day 1 and Week 48 (pre-
infusion of ublituximab or IV placebo), and Week 96  or Early Withdrawal from 
Treatment Visit and Week 116 . 
o The study sites will instruct the subjects enrolled into the study  to return with thei r 
used and unused teriflunomide or oral placebo blister packs to the investigation site 
during every visit as shown in the Schedule of Assessments in S ection  6 as part of the 
teriflunomide or oral placebo drug accountability assessment program. Compliance 
with teriflunomide or oral placebo administration will be reviewed with all subjects 
during those times by the study site and documented on the eCRF by the study site .  
A comment will be entered into the subjec t’s subject diary and on the accountability 
log for any variation from the prescribed dosing schedule, such as additional or missed doses.  
o Compliance will also be assessed by inspection of the blister packs and counting of 
the used and unused tablets  at each visit by the study site . Details of teriflunomide or 
oral placebo  (date and time of first dose, last do se prior to visit, number of tablets  
dispensed and number of returned tablets) will be recorded in the eCRF.  
 DISPENSING AND ADMINISTRATION OF UBLITUXIMAB  OR IV PLACEBO 
Subjects in the United States (US) during 2017 will initially receive ublituximab at a concentration of 10  mg/mL and will be switched to the higher concentration (25 mg/mL) in 
January 2018. All US based subjects enrolled in the study after December 2017, will begin the 
study using 25 mg/mL. All subjects in Europe will begin and complete the study with the higher concentration (25 mg/mL).  
Ublituximab or IV placebo will be administered in the MS center/neur ology department/ infusion 
center associated with MS center or neurology department . The MS centers/neurology department 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 75 of 140 
 must have skilled personnel and adequate equipment  to provide emergency treatment should the 
subject experience IRR, anaphylaxis, hypot ension and/ or respiratory distress.   
If randomized to ublituximab , each subject will receive ublituximab, a  single dose of 150 mg of 
ublituximab on Week  1 Day 1 with an infusion rate of 4 hours  for a total volume of 250 mL to be 
infused. Subjects will receive  450  mg of ublituximab on Week 3 Day 15, Weeks 24, 48, and 72 with 
an infusion rate of 1 hour for a total volume of 250 mL. Subjects receiving IV placebo will receive the 
same infusion volume and infusion rate as those subjects receiving ublituximab. P lease see Sections 
7.5.2.2 (dilution of ublituximab or IV placebo) and 7.5.2.3 (administration) for further details.   
If the liver enzymes (ALT and/or AST) are Grade 2 or higher , or if the neutrophil count or  platelets 
counts are Grade  3 or 4, the dos ing of ublituximab or IV placebo will be withheld.  A re -test will occur 
within 14 days after the initial test .  Ublituximab  or IV placebo  infusion can occur once the liver 
enzymes are less than Grade 2, and if the neutrophil count or  platelets counts are less than  Grade 3 .  
Please see Section 5.2 ( Guidance for  Laboratory Abnormalities) for further details.  
 
7.5.2.1 GUIDELINES FOR INFUSION TREATMENT OF UBLITUXIMAB  OR IV PLACEBO  
• Necessity of MS Center /Neurology Department : Center must have pers onnel and equipment 
necessary to provide adequate emergency treatment for anaphylaxis, hypotension and 
respiratory distress.  
• Method of Administration: Ublituximab or IV placebo must be administered as an intravenous 
infusion through a dedicated intravenous line and will be done under the supervision of the study investigator  or a designee  
• Potential Drug Interactions :  No drug interactions have been reported to date.  
• Pre- medications:  Pre-medicate 30- 60 minutes p rior to each dose of ublituximab  or IV placebo 
with an antihistamine (diphenhydramine 50 mg  or equivalent ), and corticosteroid 
(dexamethasone 10 -20 mg or equivalent).  Oral acetaminophen, 650 mg  (or equivalent; only 
used for intervention) should be restricted to subject who experience fever or pyrexia after Week 1 dose, or as clinically warranted and additional medication (which needs to be 
documented) may be used at discretion of the physician if adverse reactions occur.  
Note: In case the above referenced medications are not available, equivalents can be used at the Investigator’s discretion. If medications are given intravenously, the IV line used for 
ublituximab/IV placebo should not be used. If needed, please consult the Medical Monitor.  
• Subject Care Implications :   
o Ublitux imab  or IV placebo  should not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  
o Ublituximab  or IV placebo  should only be diluted in 0.9% NaCl.  
o Diluted ublituximab  or IV placebo  should be checked before administration for 
cloudiness, color, or deposits.  Ublituximab  or IV placebo  should not be administered if it 
does not conform to the manufacturer’s specifications. The  Monitor/Sponsor must be 
informed immediately of any quality concerns or questions about the product. 
o It is recommended that ublituximab  or IV placebo be administered immediately after 
dilution within 24  hours . 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 79 of 140 
 o Subsequent Doses of 450mg ublituximab/IV placebo (Week 3 Day 15, Weeks 
24, 48, and 72):  
 The suggested initial rate of infusion should be 100 mL/hr. If 100 mL/hr is 
tolerated for 30 minutes, then the remainder of the infusion can be completed 
based on Treating Neurologist/ PI discretion (rates of 100 mL/h r up to a 
maximum of 400 mL/hr).  
 At Treating Neurologist/ PI discretion, subjects may receive ublituximab/IV 
placebo at even slower rates, as long as the known stability profile of diluted 
ublituximab is not violated (see ublituximab IB). An example of such  an 
infusion scheme is 25 mL/hr for 30 minutes, increasing to 50 mL/hr after 30 minutes, then 75 mL/hr after 30 minutes, concluding at 100  mL/hr for 1 hour 
and 45 minutes.  
 If there are any questions about a particular infusion scheme, please contact 
the CR O or Sponsor.  
 If there is a second interruption of the infusion  on the same infusion  day due to IRR symptoms, the 
infusion of ublituximab  or IV placebo  must be stopped and the subject should be scheduled for the 
next day. IRR is not a reason to discontinu e a subject from the study  or future infusions . 
 
Infusion Delays due to Relapse  
For subjects reporting a suspected relapse the T reating Neurologist  should perform an U nscheduled 
Relapse Visit. The next scheduled infusion visit is postponed until the subject is back to baseline or 
PI/Treating Neurologist  does not expect any improvement.

Ublituximab or IV placebo infusion days are defined as Week 1 Day 1, Week 3 Day 15 and Weeks 24, 
48, and 72. On those infusion days teriflunomide  or oral placebo  should be administered after 
completion of the IV infusion.  
On Week 1 Day 1, if vomiting occurs during the ublituximab or IV placebo infusion, do not administer 
teriflunomide  or oral placebo  on Week 1 Day 1.  The first dose of teriflunomide or oral placebo will 
occur on Week 1 Day2 . On other ublituximab or IV placebo infusion days, if vomiting occurs during 
infusion , do not administer t eriflunomide or oral placebo  on that day.  Resume administration of 
teriflunomide or oral placebo  the next day.

 8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section describes the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety 
endpoints.  Safety related analyses are described in Section 9. Full details will be provided in a  
formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) .  The final Clinical S tudy Report  will describe deviations from 
the SAP, if any.   
The statistical analyses will be done once all subjects have completed Week 96 (Week 96 visit or 
earlier if withdrawn).  
8.1 SAMPLE SIZE  AND P OWER  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 this required sample size is 
increas
ed to 220 per  group or a total random ized of 440. 
8.2 GENERAL ANALYSIS CONVENTION  
Unless  otherwise stated, all analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9. 4 or higher and the 
primary hypothesis test on relapses will be conducted at the two -sided type I error set to 0.0 5.  All 
tertiary  hypothes es will be conducted at a two -sided significance level of 0.05.  P -values will be 
presented with 4 decimals and p -values that are less than 0.00 01 will be presented as <0.00 01. 
Continuous (non- survival related) data will be summarized using descriptive statistics: number of 
observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum, and 
maximum.  Frequencies and percentages will be used to summarize categorical (discrete) data.  
Presentations of categorical data will generally suppress percentages for items where the cou nt is 
zero in order to draw attention to the nonzero counts.  
8.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES WILL BE  DESCRIBED IN  DETAIL  IN THE 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  COMPLETED PRIOR TO FINAL 
DATA LOCK. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS

 SAFETY POPULATION  
The Safety Population will include all subjects who receive  at least one dose of study drug 
(ublituximab or teriflunomide, with corresponding placebos).  All safety assessments including 
toxicity will be performed on the Safety Population  by treatment actually received . 
 INTENTION -TO-TREAT (ITT)  
The Intention- to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects. Subjects will be 
analyzed by randomized treatment group. Analyses of key efficacy endpoints based on ITT population  will serve as sensitivity analyses .

baseline and post -baseline MRI  efficacy assessment . 
Subjects will be analyzed by randomized treatment group.  
 PER -PROTOCOL GROUP (PP)  
The Per-Protocol (PP) p opulati on will consist of all subject s in the mITT group who were treated 
for at least 1.75 years and do not have a major protocol  deviation  that might impact efficacy 
analysis . Th e Per-P rotocol population will on ly be used  for sensitivity ana lysis of the prima ry 
efficacy and k ey se conda ry variables. Subjects will be analyzed by randomized treatment group.  
8.4 SUBJECT DISPOSITION  
 SCREENING AND E NROLLMENT  
Enrollment will be summarized by treatment group. A table will present the number and percentages 
of subjects by treatment group.  Details include number of subjects screened, number of screening 
failures with reason and number of subjects enrolled.

follow -up, subjects ’ allocation by c ountry  & region ) will be tabulated by treatment group.  
Discontinuation of study medications prior to the end of stud y will be summarized by treatment 
group and reason for discontinuation  will be displayed . Drug discontinuation and termination  from 
study prior to the end of the study will be summarized by treatment group and reason for discontinuation and/or withdrawal (termination) will be displayed . Listings will present time to and 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 82 of 140 
 reason for discontinuation or termination  by treatment group and subject . In addition, a table of 
major protocol deviations  will be presented by group . 
8.5 SUBJECT DEMOGRAPHICS AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized as percentages for categorical 
variables and a s mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum for continuous 
measures. The analyses of baseline characteristics will be presented  for the Safety, ITT, mITT, and PP  
Population s by treatment group.    
8.6 MEDICAL HISTORY  
Medical history will be captured  at the Screening visit.  Medical history will be coded using MedDRA 
and will be listed and summarized by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term for the Safety 
population . 
All prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be classified by preferred terms 
according to the  World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary  and will be summarized by the 
number and percentage of subjects by preferred term . Prior medications and procedures are those 
which have a stop date prior to the randomization date, and concomitant medications and 
procedures are those which have a stop date after treatment start  date or are ongoing . Concomitant 
medications will  be assessed at both scheduled and unscheduled visits.  
8.7 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE  
The dose (mg) of study drugs administered, the total number of doses of study drugs, and the duration of treatment will be summarized with descriptive statistics.   
For ublituximab or IV placebo infusions,   treatment exposure is summarized as the total 
number of infusions (greater than 50% complete) received over the 5 expected infusions.  
Furthermore, the overall number of infusions, number and percentage (based on all 
infusions) of  infusions completed with/without interruption and infusions not completed 
will be calculated per arm.  The number and percentage of patients (based on all patients with at least one infusion) with and without any infusion complication (interruption or sto p) 
per arm will be presented as well.  The percentage of planned total infusion received will also be calculated.  
 
For teriflunomide or oral placebo, the proportion of at least 80 percent of taken oral medication will 
be calculated.  These proportions will be summarized by treatment group.  
8.8 INTERIM SAMPLE SIZE REASSESSMENT  
An independent committee, Blinded Assessment Relapse Team (BART), reporting to TG 
Therapeutics, and the DSMB will reassess the sample size for the study when 210 of the 220  
participants have been randomized.  Assuming a uniform rate of recruitment, we need an estimate as to how many person years of exposure will occur before an interim adjustment occurs.  If 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 85 of 140 
 Relapses that occur after study drugs are withdrawn will be assessed over the remai nder of the 
study period and this data will be utilized as part of additional sensitivity analysis (described in the 
statistical plan) as long as the subject has not withdrawn their consent to be in the trial.  
 The trea tment  group will have 2 levels  (teriflunomide / IV placebo  or ublituximab /oral placebo).  In 
order to  acco unt for diffe rent treatment d urations  am ong subjects, the  log- transforme d 
stand ardized treatment duration  (randomization to date last treatment before early withdrawal  or 
completion of Week 96 asses sment ) will be  included in the  mod el a s an “offset” variable fo r 
appro priate computation of the Annualized Relapse Rate .   will be used to assess 
the overall model with subjects  in a repeated stateme nt using a G enera lized Estim ating  Equation 
(GEE) approach . 
 
Two -sided 95% conf idence intervals of  the ra te ratio will be  provid ed for the c omp arisons of  
Ublituximab /oral placebo  versus teriflunomide /IV placebo .  The  estimated r elapse rate and its 2-
sided  95% confide nce int ervals will be  provided f or each treatment group.
 
 SECONDARY E FFICACY VARIABLES  
The key secondary outcomes will be tested using a hierarchical approach with the order specified  
below  using a step -down procedure where each test is at a Type I error 0.05. If any endpoints fail to 
reach significance, then formal testing of significance of the subsequent secondary outcomes will not 
be performed.  
1. Total  number of gadolinium enhancing (Gd -enhancing) T1 -lesions per MRI scan by Week 96.     
2. Total  number of new and enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions (NELs) per MRI scan by Week  
96. 
3. Time to Confi rmed Disability Progression (CDP) for at least 12 weeks occurring during the 
96-week, double -blind treatment period. *   
4. Proportion of subjects with No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA) from Week 24 to Week 
96.   
5. Proportion  of subjects reaching impaired SDMT (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) from baseline 
to Week  96.   
6. Percentage change in Brain Volume from baseline to Week 96 . 
 
* Confirmed Disability Progression for at least 12 weeks during the 96 -week treatment period will 
be analyzed using pooled data from the two identical studies TG1101 -RMS301 and TG1101-
RMS302 . 
The total number of gadolinium enhancing (Gd -enhancing) T1 -lesions will be calculated as the sum 
of the individual number of lesions at weeks 12, 24, 48, and 96, divided by the total number of MRI 
scans of the brain.  The total number of new and enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions will be calculated 
as the sum of the individual number of lesions at weeks 24, 48, and 96, divided by the total number 
of MRI scans of the brain.  The MRI count variabl es will be assessed for differences between the 
treatment groups using negative binomial regression with an offset based on time on study and covariates, region , baseline EDSS strata, and baseline MRI counts.   Percent brain volume change will 
be assessed between the two groups using linear mixed effects models  with 
covariates region , baseline EDSS strata, and baseline brain volume.   
 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 86 of 140 
 Disability progression is defined as an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score that is not  
attributable to another etiology (e.g., fever, concurrent illness, or concomitant medication) when the 
baseline score is 5.5 or less, and ≥0.5 when the baseline score is above 5.5.  Disability progression is 
considered confirmed when the increase in the E DSS score is confirmed at regularly scheduled visits 
at least 12 or  24 weeks after the initial documentation of neurological worsening.  
Please note that Confirmed Disability Progression for at least 12 weeks during the 96 -week 
treatment period will be analyzed using pooled data from  the two identical studies TG1101 -
RMS301 and TG1101 -RMS302.  With the exception of this endpoint (CDP), which  will be analyzed 
at the pooled level, all other secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested if and only if the individual 
study secondary endpoint listed ahead of it has reached the significance level at 0.05.    
All pre -specified pooled analyses are listed below.  However, only CDP for at least 12 weeks is part 
of the secondary analysis and the remainder are included in the tertiary analysis.  
1. Time to  Confirmed Disability P rogression for at least 12 weeks (secondary analysis)  
2. Time to  Confirmed Disability P rogression for at least 24 weeks (tertiary analysis)  
3. Time to Confirmed Disability Improvement for at least 12 weeks (tertiary analysis)  
4. Time to Confirmed Disability Improvement for at least 24 weeks (tertiary analysis)  
 
 Summary tables  of progression to CDP will present the proportion who achieved CDP at Week 96  and 
associated 95% CIs for each treatment group. The median time -to-event with 2-sided  95% CIs as well 
as the proportion of subjects remaining event -free at times of interest will be estimated using Kaplan -
Meier methods implemented with .  All time to CDP (and CDI) endpoints will 
be analyzed similarly.  
 
 
The p roportion  of subjects with  No Evidence of Disease Activity  (NEDA) will be calculated at Week 
96. A subject with NEDA is defined as a subject without relapses confirmed by the IRAP, without MRI activities (no T1 Gd+ lesions and no new/enlarging T2 lesions), and no 12 -week Confirmed D isability 
Progression. Any evidence of disease activity from Week 24 to Week 96 will be counted as not 
reaching NEDA.  Any evidence of disease activity before Week 24 will not count.  NEDA rates will be 
compared using logistic regression  with baseline adjustments the same as 
used in the primary analysis plus baseline MRI counts and without an offset to take into account time 
on study.     
 Change in c ognition (SDMT)  will be assessed  using  the total score at each SDMT  visit which is defined 
as the total number of correct answers reported in the CRF.  Impaired SDMT is defined as a decrease from baseline of at least 4 points  at any post -baseline assessment  up to the Week 96 visit .  The 
propor tion of impaired SDMT will be analyzed in all subjects in the mITT population .  SDMT rates 
will be compared using logistic regression  with baseline adjustments the 
same as used in the primary endpoint analysis, without treatment duration offset, but including log -
transformed baseline MRI counts (T1 unenhancing, T2, Gad enhancing).  To avoid zero values for the 
log transformation of MRI counts, 1 will be added to each observation before transforming . 
 SENSITIVITY ANALYSES  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 87 of 140 
 Sensitivity Analysis  
1.  The primary analysis will be repeated based on all reported MS relapses (rather than just 
confirmed ones).  
2.  A time to relapses analysis using Cox proportional hazards model with first IRAP -confirmed 
relapse as the primary event will be conducted to compare with the primary analysis in a negative 
binomial model. The  Cox proportional hazards model will be specified with treatment, region, 
number of relapses in previous year, baseline EDSS  score , baseline number of T1 Gd -enhancing 
lesions sex and the subject’s age at baseline as covariates.  
3.  To assess the effects of treatment withdrawals, the primary analysis will be repeated using the 
information on relapses which occur during the period following drug withdrawal to the end of the study period regardless of whether additional treatment were utilized.  Relapses which  occurred 
after permanent discontinuation of study medication will be included and natural log (time on study in years) rather than the natural log  (time on study drug in years) will be used as the offset variable 
in the negative binomial model, which is the primary analysis.  
4. We will examine the dropouts from the trial using all participants who provided withdrawal of 
consent excluding deaths.  Multiple imputation will be used to impute the expected number of relapses a participant would have had if they had continued to participate in the trial.  To perform 
the imputation, 10 replicates will be used since a relapse on treatment is relatively low frequency 
event.   The covariates used to model and predict the imputations will include: treatment, region, 
number of relapses in previous year, baseline EDSS  score , baseline number of T1 Gd -enhancing 
lesions sex and the subject ’s age at baseline as covariates.  
5.  For secondary outcomes T1 Gd enhancing, T2 NELs, and 12 week CDP, the effects of dropouts and 
study discontinuations will be similarly evaluated as number 4 above.   
6.  Additional sensitivity analyses may be defined in the analysis plan prior to database lock.  
 
 TER TIARY EFFICACY AND OTHER VARIABLES  
All tertiary analyses will be assessed at a Type I err or of 0.05 with no adjustment for multiplicity.   
1. Change in MSFC score  from baseline to Week 96  
2. Time to  Confirmed D isability Progression  (CDP)  for at least 24 weeks  
3. Time to  Confirmed Disability Improvement  (CDI)  for at least 12 weeks  
4. Time to  Confirmed Disability Improvement (CDI) for at least 24 weeks  
5. Health outcomes (MSQoL -54 (inclusive of SF36); FIS, hospitalization, steroid use, time out of 
work)  
6. Total volume of Gd enhancing T1 lesions per MRI scan over the treatment period  
7. Volume of T2 lesions  
8. Volume of hypointense T1 lesion component (black holes)  
9. Proportion  of subjects free of disability progression at Weeks 24, 48 and 96.   
10. Proportion  of subjects with a relapse  
11. Time to first confirmed relapse  
 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 88 of 140 
 Change in MSFC  and Health Outomes (MSQoL -54 (inclusive of SF36), FIS), will be analyzed using  
linear Mixed Models .  including results with baseline as a covariate along with region and other 
covariates if used in the primary analyses.   
 
The analysis  of CDI at 12 and 24 weeks will utilize the same approach as that used for CDP.     12 Week 
Confirmed Disability Improvem ent (12 Week CDI) is defined as a reduction from the baseline EDSS 
score of at least 1.0 point (or 0.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was >5.5) that was sustained and 
confirmed at the next scheduled visit at least 12 weeks after the initial documentatio n of neurological 
improvement .  Similarly, 24- week Confirmed Disability Improvement (24 Week CDI) requires an 
initial reduction from baseline EDSS score and a subsequent confirmation of the reduction at all 
regular scheduled visits for at least 24 Weeks after the initial documentation of neurological 
worsening  
 
Hospitalization, Steroid Use, and Time Out of Work will be summarized by descriptive statistics as 
well as frequency and percentage.  For Time Out of Work, percentages of missed work hours will be 
compared between arms using Wilcoxon rank sum tests.   For Steroid Use, the number of IRAP 
confirmed relapses treated with steroid will be analyzed the same way as the primary endpoint.  
For analysis of lesion volume related variables (Total volume of Gd enhancing T1 lesions per MRI 
scan over the treatment period, Volume of T2 lesions, Volume of hypointense T1 lesion component (black holes)) Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analyses will be implemented  
. 
Time to first confirmed relapse is defined as (date of relapse onset – date of randomization + 1) and 
will be regarded as censored at the end of treatment. The analysis will be similar to the one of time 
to confirmed disability progression. The proportions of subjects w ith a relapse and subjects free of 
disability progression at different time points will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.

 9 SAFETY REPORTING AND ANALYSIS  
9.1 SAFETY ANALYSES  
To evaluate the safety of ublituximab /placebo  and teriflunomide/oral placebo , as determined by 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including MS worsening.   
Safety will be tabulated as described below in the safety section.  Tables will summarize the 
proportion of subjects ever ex periencing a particular AE, and in select tables will also include  the 
number of times a particular AE occurs.  
Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, intensity, and type of adverse events, as well as on 
clinically significant changes in the su bject ’s physical examination, vital signs, and clinical laboratory 
results.  Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population.  Safety variables will be 
tabulated and presented by treatment  actually received.  Exposure to study treatment and reasons 
for discontinuation of study treatment will also be tabulated .  Must obtain expert evaluations of brain 
MRI images of subjects with suspected opportunistic CNS infections including PML.   
For select laboratory values, box plots of the values over time will be used for displays of these 
parameters . In the event of higher than expected incidence rates of abnormalities, further exploration 
of combinations of events, such as Hy’s law, will be examined.  
9.2 ADVERSE E VENTS  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation 
subject  administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal  
relationship with this treatment.   An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether  or not considered related to the 
medicinal product. This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or 
frequency from the baseline condi tion.  
9.3 ADVERSE EVENT CHARACTERISTICS  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revis ed NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 3 will be utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment 
areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 3.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 3 can 
be downloaded from the following  web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm.     
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 3 is to be used for the 
grading of severity of symptoms and abnormal findings.  For adverse events not covered by the NCI -
CTCAE Version 4.0 3 grading system, the following definitions will be used:  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 91 of 140 
 • Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated.  
• Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated.  
• Grade 4 : Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5 : Death related to AE. 
9.4 ADVERSE EVENT EXPECTEDNESS  
AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ for expedited reporting purposes only . Expected AEs are thos e 
listed in the Investigator Brochure s for either ublituximab or teriflunomide.  
9.5 TREATMENT EMERGENT ADVERSE EVENTS (TEAE’S)  
The frequency and percentages of subjects with treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be 
tabulated by system organ class (SOC ) and preferred term ( PT), where treatment -emergent is 
defined as any AE with an onset on or after the first dose of study medication and through 30 days 
after the last dose of study medication  or with an onset prior to the first dose of study medication 
that increases in severity on, or after the first dose of study medication and through 30 days after the 
last dose of study medication . 
In addition, TEAEs that are considered at least possibly related to study treatment will be tabulated 
as well as deaths, SAEs, and events resulting in treatment discontinuation  or termination . 
Additionally, the subset of events which occurred after the last study drug administration will be 
summarized.  
9.6 ADVERSE E VENTS / SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT CAUSALITY ASSESSMENT 
The Investigator must also assess the relationship of any adverse event to the use of study drug, 
(whether none, one, or all) based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
1. Not Related : Clear -cut temporal and/or mechanistic relation to a cause  other than the 
study drug.  
2. Doubtful: There is no reasonable possibility that the event is related to the study 
medications but a definite cause cannot be ascertained.  
3. Possible : There is still a reasonable possibility that the cause of the event was the st udy 
medications but there exists a more likely cause of the event such as complications of 
progressive disease.  
4. Probable : The most likely cause of the event is the study medications  but other causes 
cannot be completely excluded.  
5. Definite: Clear cut tempor al and/or mechanistic relation to the study medications .  All 
other causes have been eliminated.  Events classified as definite will often be confirmed 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 92 of 140 
 by documenting resolution on discontinuation of the study medications  and recurrence 
upon resumption.  
In the summary of drug related AEs, “Not Related” and “Doubtful”  will be considered as “Not Drug 
Related” and “Possible”, “Probable”, and “Definite”  will be considered as “Drug Related.”   In the event 
that causality is missing for an AE, it will be considered as “Drug Related.”  
 RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
All adverse events of any subject  during the course of the trial will be reported on the electronic 
CaseRreport F orm, and the investigator will give his or her opinion as to the relationship of the 
adverse event to trial drug treatment (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to trial drug 
administration –ublituximab /IV placebo or teriflunomide /oral placebo ).  If the adverse event  is 
serious, it should be reported as soon as possible and no greater than 24 hours to the sponsor or 
designee.  Other untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical trial are also to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur prior to assignment of trial treatment that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no 
treatment run -in). 
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to ublituximab /IV placebo  and/or 
teriflun omide /oral placebo  treatment , as well as all pregnancies, spanning from the signing of the 
informed consent and  until 20 weeks  after discontinuation or completion of either protocol -specific 
treatment as defined by the protocol for that subject , are to be recorded on the e CRF /Pregnancy 
Report Form .  
 ABNORMAL LABORATORY VALUES AND VITAL SIGNS  
The reporting of abnormalities of vital signs as adverse events should be avoided.  Abnormalities of 
vital signs should not be reported unless any criterion for an SAE is fulfilled, the vital signs abnormalities cause the subject  to discontinue trial treat ment, or the investigator insists that the 
abnormality should be reported as an AE.  Abnormal laboratory results should be noted in the eCRF as an adverse event if they are associated with an overdose, require prolong in-patient  
hospitalization, or are oth erwise considered clinically significant by the investigator. If an abnormal 
laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom 
should be reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory value or vital sig n should be considered 
additional information that must be collected in the relevant eCRF.  If the laboratory abnormality is 
a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or 
AE eCRF.  
Clinical Laboratory Res ults will be summarized.  Summary statistics for actual values and for changes 
from baseline will be tabulated for laboratory results by scheduled visit.  Subjects  with laboratory 
values outside of the normal reference range at any post -baseline assessment  will be summarized, 
and graded per NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 3 when applicable.  Subject  incidence of laboratory toxicity 
will be summarized by treatment group and maximum grade for each laboratory test . 
 HANDLING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 93 of 140 
 All adverse events resulting in discontinuation from the trial should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  Subjects  must be followed for AEs for 20 weeks  after discontinuation or completion of 
protocol -specific treatment.  All new AEs occurring during this period must be re ported and followed 
until resolution unless, in the opinion of the investigator, these values are not likely to improve 
because of the underlying disease or the subject is lost to follow up .  In this case, the investigators 
must record his or her reasoning  for this decision in the subject ’s medical record and as a comment 
on the e CRF.  After 20 weeks , only AEs, SAEs, or deaths assessed by the investigator as treatment 
related are to be reported . 
9.7 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 DEFINITIONS OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
The definitions of serious adverse events (SAEs) are given below.  The P rincipal Investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the trial are familiar with the content of this section.  
An SAE or reaction is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death, is immediately life -threatening,  
• Requires in -patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and/or  
• Causes a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
thre atening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject  or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the previous definition.  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are  intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A SUSAR is defined as a suspected unexpected SAE, and SU SAR reporting is encompassed within SAE 
reporting guidelines as defined in this section.  
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of “in -
patient  hospitalization” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be treated as 
an SAE and immediately reported):  
• Emergency Department or Emergency Room  
• Out- patient  or same -day surgery units  
• Observation or short -stay unit  
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospice or skilled nursing facility  
• Nursing home s, Custodial care or Respite care facility

 Hospitalization due to MS relapse does not need to be reported to the Sponsor as an SAE if the 
Treating Neurologist medically confirms the relapse.   The subsequent IRAP adjudication will not 
impact the reporting status of the SAE.  
Events related to underlying MS disease (i.e., MS progression) also do not require reporting as an 
SAE.  
Hospitalization during the trial for a pre -planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was 
planned prior to entry in the trial), does not require reporting as a serious adverse event to the Sponsor . 
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING BY INVESTIGATORS  
It is important to distinguish between “serious” and “severe” adverse events, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a mea sure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For  example, nausea which persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs 
on the e CRF.  
Adverse events classified by the treating investigator as serious  require expeditious handling and 
reporting to the Sponsor in order to comply with r egulatory requirements.  Serious adverse events 
may occur at any time from the signing of the informed consent form through the 20 -week  Follow-
up Period after the last trial treatment.  Sponsor or designee must be notified of all SAEs, regardless 
of causality, within 24 hours of the first knowledge of the event by the treating physician or research 
personnel.   
To report an SAE, see the appropriate SAE e CRF page.  
All SAEs and medically confirmed deaths (regardless of causality assessment) spanning from the signing of the informed consent and  until 20 week s of last trial treatment must be expeditiously 
reported to the sponsor as SAEs within the e CRF and followed until resolution (with autopsy report 
if applicable).  
The investigator must review and sign off on  the SAE data on the SAE report.  The SAE will be 
reported to the Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) as outlined in the Safety Monitoring Plan.   
If an SAE is reported to the sponsor or designee via fax, the same information must be entered on the 
eCRF within 2 4 hours (1 business day).  The SAE transmission should be confirmed by the site 
personnel submitting the report.  
Follow- up information for SAEs and information on non -serious AEs that become serious should also 
be reported to the sponsor or designee as soo n as it is available; these reports should be submitted 
using the appropriate e CRF.  The detailed SAE reporting process will be provided to the sites in the 
Investigator Study Guide . 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 95 of 140 
 Investigators must report SAEs and follow -up information to their respons ible Institutional Review 
Board (IRBs /EC)/Independent Ethics Committee according to the policies of the responsible IRB  or 
Ethics Committee . 
9.8  SPONSOR SAE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Sponsor is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the Competent Authority, other applicable 
Regulatory A uthorities, and participating investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, FDA 
regulations, and/or local regulatory requirements.  
Sponsor is re sponsible for reporting related, unexpected fatal or life -threatening events associated 
with the use of the trial drugs to the regulatory agencies and competent authorities via telephone or 
fax within 7 calendar days after being notified of the event.  The Sponsor will report all related , 
unexpected SAEs including non- death/non -life-threatening SAEs associated with the use of the trial 
medications to the applicable Regulatory  Authorities , investigators, and central IRBs  or EC by a 
written safety report with in 15 calendar days of notification.  Investigators using local IRBs or EC are 
responsible for sending written safety reports for these events to their IRBs or EC within 15 calendar 
days  or accordingly to the timelines outlined in the policies of the respo nsible IRB or EC .  
9.9 RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or SAEs on the 
SAE Report Forms and AE e CRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
All AEs, includ ing those that meet SAE reporting criteria, should be recorded on the AE e CRF; AEs 
that meet the definition of an SAE should additionally be reported . 
9.10  DIAGNOSIS VS. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the subject ’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the opinion 
of the PI  and/or Treating Neurologist , the AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, 
disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather 
than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE e CRF).  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported, as follow -up 
information is available.  If a diagnosis is determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation 
of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be update d to reflect the diagnosis . 
 PERSISTENT OR RECURRENT ADVERSE EVENTS  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject  evaluation time 
points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the AE e CRF.    If 
a persistent AE becomes more severe (changes from a Grade 1 or 2 AE to a Grade 3 or 4 AE) or lessens 
in severity (changes from a Grade 3 or 4 AE to a Grade 1 or 2 AE), it should be recorded on a separate 
SAE Report Form and/or AE e CRF.   

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 96 of 140 
 A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject  evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or AE  eCRF 
for each recurrence . 
 ABNORMAL LABORATORY VALUES  
Abnormal laboratory r esults should be noted in the eCRF as an adverse event if they are associated 
with an overdose, require or prolong in -patient  hospitalization, or are otherwise considered 
clinically significant by the investigator. If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated 
with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE, and the 
associated laboratory value or vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected in the relevant eCRF.  If the labo ratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only 
the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE eCRF. 
 DEATHS  
All medically confirmed  deaths, regardless of attribution, spanning from the signing of the informed 
consent and  until 20 weeks  after discontinuation or completion of either protocol -specific treatment  
will be recorded within the e CRF  and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor.  
When recording a serious adverse event with an outcome of death, the event or condition that caus ed 
or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event page of the e CRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, record “Death NOS” on the e CRF Adverse Even t page . 
 HOSPITALIZATION, PROLONGED HOSPITALIZATION, OR SURGERY  
Any AE that results in  in-patient  hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented 
and reported as an SAE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  There are some hospitalization scenarios that do not require reporting as an SAE when there is no occurren ce of an 
AE (refer to Sections 9.7.1 and 9.7.2) .   
 PRE -EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS  
A pre -existing relevant medical condition is one that is present at the start of the trial.  Such 
conditions should be recorded on the study’s appropriate medical history eC RF.  A pre -existing 
medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the trial.  When recording such events on the appropriate SAE Report Form and/or AE  eCRF, it is important  to convey the concept that the pre- existing condition has 
changed by including applicable descriptors. 
 PROTOCOL -DEFINED EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST  
Reference the ublituximab  Investigator Brochure for Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) . AEs 
that are considered AESIs are to be reported in the appropriate eCRF. SAEs that are considered 
AESIs should be reported following the timeline and reporting process outlined in Secti on 9.7.2.  
 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 97 of 140 
 Pregnancy:  
Since pregnancy as such is not considered to be an adverse event, it does not need to be reported as 
an AESI.  However, if pregnancy is associated with adverse events, it is these adverse events that need to be reported in eCRF.  Preg nancy reporting requirements outlined in Appendix A must be 
followed. 
Overdose: 
All instances of overdose , whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, of either ublituximab/IV placebo 
or Teriflunomide/oral placebo must be reported in eCRF on the Overdose form .  Anything over the 
prescribed daily dose is considered an overdose.  
If an overdose is associated with adverse events, it is these adverse events that need to be reported 
in eCRF.  If an adverse event associated with an overdose meets a seriousness criterion , it must be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE.  
Suicidal ideation and behavior will be identified by the AE preferred terms included in MedDRA SMQ 
“Suicide/self -injury”.

 10 STOPPING RULES  
The DSMB (Study Chairs, Medical Monitor and Sponsor Representative) will be in charge of reviewing 
safety data. These events will be reviewed by the DSMB and potentially other study i nvestigators 
during the course of the study.  All other serious and non -serious adverse events will be documented, 
managed  for each subject  including review of the safety data by the DSMB and possible study 
participation termination at the  investigator and DSMB discretion .  The independent DSMB will be 
comprised of a  total of 5 members with a t least 3 MDs, a biostatistician and the DSMB chair . 
The DSMB may stop the study due to safety reasons after reviewing the safety data.

 11 ETHICAL, FINANCIAL, AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
This trial will be conducted according to the standards of Good Clinical Practice outlined in the ICH 
E6 Tripartite Guideline and CFR Title 21 part 312, applicable government regulations, institutional 
research policies and procedures and any other local applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
11.1  IRB /EC  APPROVAL  
The trial protocol, ICF, IB s, available safety information, subject  documents (e.g., trial diary), subject  
recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), information about payments (i.e., PI payments) and 
compensation available to the subjects and documentation evidencing the PI’s qualifications must be 
submitted to the IRB/EC  for ethical review and approval prior to the trial start.   
The PI/Sponsor and/or designee will follow all necessary regulations to ensure initial and ongoing, IRB/EC  trial review. The PI/Sponsor and/or designee  (as appropriate) must submit and, where 
necessary, obtain approval from the IRB /EC for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to 
the informed consent document.  Investigators will be advised by the sponsor or designee whether 
an amendment is considered substantial or non -substantial and whether it requires submission for 
approval or notification only to an IRB /EC. 
If applicable, the PI will notify the IRB/EC  within 90 days  of the end of the trial, or if the trial 
terminates early, the PI must notify the IRB /EC within 15 days  of the termination.  A reason for the 
early termination must be provided (as defined in Directive 2001/20/EC). The Sponsor will either prepare or review all submission documents prior to submission to the IRB /EC. 
11.2  REGULATORY APPR OVAL  
As required by local regulations, the Sponsor will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and approval 
of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to trial initiation. If required, the Sponsor will also ensure that the implementation of substantial amendment to the protocol and other relevant 
trial documents happen only after approval by the relevant Regulatory A uthorities.  
Safety updates for ublituximab /IV placebo  and teriflunomide/oral placebo  will be prepared by the 
Sponsor (or its represent ative ), as required, for submission to the relevant Regulatory A uthority.   
11.3  INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY  
Details of insurance and/or indemnity will be contained within the written agreement between the PI or site and the Sponsor. 
11.4  INFORMED CONSENT  
Informed consent is a process by which a subject voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to 
participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate.  Informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed and dated informed consent form.  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 100  of 140 
 The ICF will be submitted for approval to the IRB /EC that is responsible for review and approval of 
the trial.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements currently required by the 
responsible Regulatory A uthority, as well as local county authority or state regulations and national 
requirements.  
Before recruitment and enrollment into the trial, each prospective candidate will be given a full explanation of the trial.  Once the essential information has been provided to the prospective 
candidate, and the investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the implications of 
participating in this trial, the candidate will be asked to give consent to participate in the trial by 
signing an informed consent form.  A notation that written informed consent has been obtained will be made in the subject ’s medical record.  A copy of the informed consent form, including the subject ’s 
signature, will be provided by th e investigator to the subject .   
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the trial design or the potential risks to the subjects, the subject ’s consent to continue participation in the trial must be obtained .  Additionally, 
upon either IRAP -confirmed or  Treating Neurologist  medically confirmed  relapse, subjects should 
re-consent to continue participation in the trial.  
11.5  CONFIDENTIALITY  
Subject  Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of subject ’s personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA ; for USA only ), and national data protection laws. 
HIPAA regulations require that, in order to participate in the trial, a subject  must sign an 
authorization from the trial that he or she h as been informed of following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this trial;  
• Who will have access to that information and why;  
• Who will use or disclose that information;  
• That health information may be further discl osed by the recipients of the information, and 
that if the information is disclosed the information may no longer be protected by federal or state privacy laws;  
• The information collected about the research trial will be kept separate from the subject ’s 
medical records, but the subject  will be able to obtain the research records after the 
conclusion of the trial;  
• Whether the authorization contains an expiration date; and  
• The rights of a research subject  to revoke his or her authorization.  
In the event that a subject  revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, by 
regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject  
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be 
made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject  is alive) at the end of 
their scheduled trial period.  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 101  of 140 
 In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and applicable parts of 21 CFR it is a require ment that the 
investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor, the R egulatory 
Authorities and the IRB /EC direct access to review the subject ’s original medical records at the site 
for verification of trial -related procedures and data.  
Measures to protect confidentiality include: only a unique trial number and year of birth  will identify 
subjects on the e CRF or other documents submitted to the Sponsor. This information will be used in 
the database for subject  identification. Subject  names , addresses or birthdate/month  will not be 
entered in the e CRF or database. No material bearing a subject ’s name will be kept on file by the 
Sponsor. Subjects  will be informed of their rights within the ICF . 
11.6  INVESTIGATOR AND STAFF INFORMATION  
Personal data of the investigators and sub -investigators may be included in the Sponsor  database, 
and shall be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  When archiving or 
processing personal data pertaining to the investigator or sub -investigator, the Sponsor shall take all 
appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this data by any unauthorized party . 
11.7  FINANCIAL INFORMATION  
The finances for this trial will be subject to a separate written agreement between the Sponsor  
and/or designee  and applicable parties.  Any Investigator financial disclosures as applicable to 21CFR 
Part 54 shall be appropriately provided.

The Sponsor/Sponsor designee will ensure that all documentation that is required to be in place 
before the trial may start, in accordance with ICH E6 and Sponsor SOPs, will be available before any trial sites are initiated . 
12.3  TRIAL DOCUMENTATION AND STORAGE  
The PI must maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated trial 
duties and should ensure that all persons assisting in the conduct of the trial are informed of their 
obligations. All persons authorized to make entries and/or corrections on the e CRFs are to be 
included on this document. All entries in the subject ’s eCRF are to be supp orted by source 
documentation where appropriate.  
Source documents are the original documents, data, records and certified copies of original records 
of clinical findings, observations and activities from which the subject ’s eCRF data are obtained. 
These ca n include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory, 
medico -technical department and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, EKG traces, copies or 
transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, X- rays, and correspondence.  
The PI and trial staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and centralized filing system 
(Site Trial File/SSF or ISF) of all trial- related (essential) docum entation, suitable for inspection at any 
time by representatives from the Sponsor  or designee  and/or applicable R egulatory Authorities.  The 
ISF/SSF must consist of those documents that individually or collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of the t rial and the quality of the data produced.  The ISF/SSF should contain as a minimum 
all relevant documents and correspondence as outlined in ICH GCP Section 13 and 21 CFR Part 312.57, including key documents such as the IB and any amendments, protocol and any amendments, signed ICFs, copies of completed eCRFs, IRB /EC approval documents, Financial Disclosure forms, 
subject  identification lists, enrollment logs, delegation of authority log, staff qualification documents, 
laboratory normal ranges, records relating to the trial drug including accountability records.  Drug accountability records should, at a minimum, contain information regarding receipt, shipment, and disposition.  Each form of drug accountability record, at a minimum, should contain PI name, da te 
drug shipped/received, date, quantity and batch/code, or lot number for identity of each shipment.  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 104  of 140 
 In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the eCRF must be maintained and be 
readily available.  
The Sponsor shall maintain adequate investigational product records and financial interest records 
as per 21CFR Part 54.6 and Part 312.57 for no less than 2 years after the last marketing application 
has been approved by FDA; or, in the event that the marketing application has not b een approved by 
FDA, for no less than 2 years after the last shipment / delivery of the drug for investigational use is 
discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation.  
The IRB /EC shall maintain adequate documentation / records of IRB /EC activities as per 21CFR 
Part  56.115 for at least 3 years after completion of the research.  
The Investigator shall maintain adequate records of drug disposition, case histories and any other 
trial -related records as per 21 CFR Part 312.62 for no less than 2 years after the last marketing 
application has been approved by FDA; or, in the event that the marketing application has not been 
approved by FDA, for no less than 2 years after the last shipment / delivery of the drug for 
investigational use is discontinued and FDA has been notified of the discontinuation.  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from Regulatory A uthorities or from the Sponsor or its 
representative, the investigator additionally agrees to keep records, including the identity of all 
participating subjects  (sufficient information to link records e.g., medical records), all original, signed 
informed consent forms, and copies of all e CRFs, SAE Reporting forms, source documents, detailed 
records of treatment disposition, and related essential regulatory  documents.   The documents listed 
above must be retained by the investigator for as long as needed to comply with national and international regulations (generally 2 years after discontinuing clinical development or after the last marketing approval).   The Sponsor or its representative will notify the investigator(s)/institutions(s) 
when the trial- related records are no longer required.   
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the trial, the sponsor and/or its representative should be prospectively notified.  The trial records must be transferred to an 
acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or to sponsor.  The investigator must obtain the sponsor written permission before disposing of any records, even if 
retention requirements have been met.  All trial files will be maintained by the Sponsor or its 
representative throughout the trial, and will be transferred to the Sponsor at the conclusion of the 
trial . 
12.4  DATA COLLECTION  
The trial e CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the trial. An electronic  Case Report Form 
(eCRF) will be utilized for the collection of all data and all data will be entered using the English 
language and should be kept current to enable the monitor to review the s ubjects ’ status throughout 
the course of the trial.  
In order to maintain confidentiality, only subject  number and year  of birth will identify the subject  in 
the eCRF.  If the subject ’s name  or full date of birth appears on any other document (e.g. , laborat ory 
report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the investigator site and replaced instead with the subject  number and subject ’s year of birth .  The investigator will maintain 
a personal subject  identification list ( subjec t numbers with corresponding subject  identifiers) to 

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 105  of 140 
 enable records to be identified and verified as authentic. Subject  data/information will be kept 
confidential, and will be managed according to applicable local, state, and federal regulations . 
12.5  TRIAL MON ITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING  
The investigator will permit trial -related monitoring, quality audits, and inspections by the 
government Regulatory A uthorities, the Sponsor or its representative(s) of all trial -related 
documents (e.g., source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, electronic 
Case Report Forms).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of appli cable trial -
related facilities.  The investigator will ensure that the trial monitor or any other compliance or QA 
reviewer is given access to all trial -related documents and trial -related facilities.   
Participation as an investigator in this trial implies the acceptance of potential inspection by government Regulatory A uthorities, the sponsor or its representative(s).  
At the Sponsor’s discretion Source Document Verification (SDV) may be performed on all data items 
or a percentage thereof.  
12.6  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
In addition to the Clinical Monitoring component of this protocol, the Sponsor’s Quality Assurance 
(QA) department shall establish an Auditing Plan document separate from the protocol to establish the criteria by which independent au diting shall be conducted during the conduct of the trial to assess 
compliance with GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.  Data or documentation audited shall be assessed for compliance to the protocol, accuracy in relation to source documents and co mpliance 
to applicable regulations.  
Each trial site shall be required to have processes and/or procedures in place that will ensure the study is conducted  according to the protocol, GCP and any applicable local, national or international 
regulations. 
12.7  DISCLOSURE AND PUBLICATION POLICY  
All information provided regarding the trial, as well as all information collected/documented during the course of the trial, will be regarded as confidential.  The Sponsor reserves the right to release 
literature publications based on the results of the trial.  
A Clinical S tudy  Report will be prepared upon completion of the study.  The Sponsor will disclose the 
trial results, in the form of a clinical study  report synopsis, to the IEC and the applicable Regulatory 
Authoriti es within one year of the end of the trial.  The format of this synopsis and that of the Clinical 
Study  Report and its addendum will comply with ICH E3 guidelines for structure and content of a 
Clinical S tudy  Report.  
The financial disclosure information will be provided to the Sponsor  or designee  prior to trial 
participation from all PIs and Sub -Investigators who are involved in the trial and named on the FDA 
1572 form.

 14 APPENDIX A; PREGNANCY  
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are Defined as Follows:  
Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 
months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age 
appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea  (based on 
the subject’s medical history)  with serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL [for US only: and estradiol 
< 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least 
six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the rep roductive status of the woman 
has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing 
potential.   In addition, f emale patients with hysterectomy but with available ovaries  are not 
considered WOCBP because of their belonging to surgically sterile category of patients.  
Contraceptive Guidelines for Women of Child-Bearing Potential:  
Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregn ant, must use effective contraception during the study and for 20 weeks after the last study 
drug was administered . The effective contraception is defined as either:  
1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subjec t. 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
2. Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks ago.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level 
assessment.  
3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the 
absence of s perm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male 
partner should be the sole partner for that subject . 
4. Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods.  
5. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):  
a. Placeme nt of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  
b. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.  
The following are unacceptable  forms of contraception for women of childbearing potential: 
 
• Female condom  
• Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding  
• Fertility awareness  
• Withdrawal  
• Cervical shield  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 110  of 140 
 Women of child -bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 5 days prior to 
initiating treatment.  
Fertile Males:  
Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring must use condom 
during treatment, and for an additional 20 weeks  after the last study drug was administered , and 
should not father a child in this period.  Male subjects  must also not donate sperm during active 
treatment and for 20 weeks foll owing the last study drug administered . 
Female partners of fertile male participants must also use effective measures of contraceptives as 
described above for females.  
Pregnancies  
To ensure subject  safety, each pregnancy in a subject  on study treatment must be reported to TG 
Therapeutics Inc. wit hin 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnant subject/male subject’s 
partner will be asked to provide informed consent to allow the pregnancy to be followed up for the full duration (or until termination) to determine outcome, including spontane ous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  Additionally, medical information will 
be collected on the newborn for 6 months after  birth, as permitted by local regulations.   
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Pregnancy Report Form and reported by the investigator to TG 
Therapeutics Inc.  Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and reported by the 
investigator to TG The rapeutics Inc.  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on 
the SAE Report Form.  
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study.  Consent to report information regarding these p regnancy outcomes should 
be obtained from the mother.

 17 APPENDIX D; INDEPENDENT RELAPSE A DJUDICATION PANEL 
(IRAP)  
Independent Relapse Adjudication Panel  (IRAP)  
The Phase III  study include s an objective definition of relapse and a standardized procedure for 
assessment of all suspected relapses as described in Section 4.4.1.  As outlined in this section, the 
Treating Neurologist will, within these guidelines, exercise his or her best clinical judgement in 
treating the suspected relapse.  However, neither the Treating  Neurologist  nor the blinded 
rater/Examining Neurologist will make the final determination of whether a suspected event is 
counted as a relapse for the purpose of calculating the primary study outcome of Annualized Relap se 
Rate (ARR).  Instead, an independent, blinded IRAP will make all relapse determinations in the Phase 
III study.  The purpose of the IRAP is to ensure that relapses are scored in a manner that is consistent 
and objective as possible, and to minimize the variability between sites.  
The IRAP will review all subject records pertaining to suspected on -study relapses (i.e., new or 
worsening neurological sympt oms  of acute onset ) that occur outside the scheduled study visits and 
are reported by the subject  within 48 hours.  Upon receiving the report  by the subject , of a suspected 
relapse/acute neurological event, the Treating Neurologist and Examining Neurologis ts wil l in an 
independent manner, and blinded to the results of their separate examination s follow the procedures 
and timelines as described below and outlined in Appendix E.   All  suspected relapses initially 
reported by the subject are evaluated by the IR AP regardless of whether the T reating  Neurologist 
considered the subject ’s symptoms to be the result of a relapse.  
The IRAP comprises of 6 independent neurologists with expertise in MS clinical research who are not 
investigators in any other TG Therapeutic s-sponsored studies with ublituximab .  The IRAP members 
are trained on study procedures by the Sponsor and an independent Contract Researc h Organization 
(CRO) who manages  all I RAP activities throughout the study.  IRAP members a re required to review 
trial data and perform adjudications in accordance with the protocol - specified definition (S ection 
4.4.1).     
The CRO  transfers blinded data  that a re relevant to assessment of relapses  (entered into the  eCRF  by 
both the Treating Neurologist and the Examining Neurologist)  and prepares  blinded case dossiers to 
be reviewed by the I RAP via a secure electroni c portal.  The dossiers include  a standardized listing 
for each suspected relapse that specified onset date, type and severity of reported symptoms, 
whether the event had disqualifying characteristics (e.g., lasted less than 24 hours , or symptoms not 
MS- related), and whether event has been  treated with methylprednisolone.  The dossiers also include  
vital signs, AEs related to the potential relapse, phy sical examinations, and EDSS scores with all 
supporting data from the standardized Neurostatus exam; values from baseline and the most recent prior quarterly assessment a re provided as context for values from the relapse evaluation visit.  
Medical/surgical history  and clinical episode history a re also provided.  In order to minimize the 
potential f or inclusion of data which can  potentially unblind an individual case under review (e.g., 
inclusion of adverse event with details that could suggest a treatment a ssignment), the CRO will 
perform additional programmatic checks on text fields pertaining to Adverse Events and p hysical 
examination findings for data points that a re part of the relapse case listing.  
Each potential relapse is  reviewed by 2 I RAP members wh o have worked and entered their 
evaluations independently, on cases randomly assigned to them by the CRO.  The I RAP adjudicates  

TG1101 -RMS301     
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 115  of 140 
 each case based on all available data provided for that case and members a re not permitted to contact 
the site or the sponsor for additional information.    If 2 I RAP reviewers reached the same decision as 
to whether an episode constitutes a relapse, the decision is  recorded by the CRO.  If the 2 reviewers 
provide a conflicting assessment, a third I RAP member  will review  the case so that a majority vote 
can be obtained.  The majority vote of up to 3 IR AP members serves as the final determination as to 
whether an event meets criteria for an on -study protocol defined relapse.   
Relapse determinations by the I RAP a re communicated to the Treating Neurologist, who will in turn, 
notify the subject and update the eCRF accordingly.  The IRAP has no involvement in subsequent 
subject  management decisions.  In order to maintain independence and blinding, the E xamining  
Neuro logist will  not receive this report.  Furthermore, neither the Treating Neurologist nor the 
subject may disclose  the IRAP decision to the Examining  Neurologist. The Treating Neurologist , upon 
receiving the IRAP decision, will counsel the subject  per Sectio n 4.4.1.  The subject will need to give 
her/his consent to continue study participation .   
For the  Phase III  study, the results of I RAP adjudications a re transferred to the Sponsor only after the 
last subject  completes the study. The Sponsor has no knowled ge of  IRAP ad judications while the 
study is ongoing.

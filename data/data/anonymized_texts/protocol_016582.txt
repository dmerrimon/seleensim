Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Definition of Key Study Terms
Terms Definition of terms
Endpoint Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a study.
NOTE: Not all endpoints are themselves assessments since certain endpoints 
might apply to populations or emerge from analysis of results. That is, 
endpoints might be facts about assessments (e.g., prolongation of survival).
Enrollment/ 
RandomizationAfter a subject ha s successfully completed the screening period and deemed 
eligible to move forward in the study, this subject will then be enrolled into 
the treatment period of the study. At that time, randomization will occur. 
Randomization is the process of assigning stu dy subjects to 1 of 2 treatment 
arms using an element of chance to reduce bias. The randomization 
assignments in this study will be blinded.
NOTE: The visit in which the subject is enrolled and administered the first 
dose of treatment (investigational prod uct or placebo) is the baseline visit 
(day 1). 
NOTE: Unequal randomization is used to allocate subjects into groups at a 
differential rate (e.g., 3 subjects may be assigned to a treatment group for 
every 1 assigned to the control group). 
Follow -up Period Period of time after the last assessment of the protocol. Follow -up 
observations for sustained adverse events are conducted during this period.
Intervention The investigational product under investigation to evaluate the effect on 
specified outcome s of interest (e.g., health -related quality of life, efficacy, 
safety and pharmacoeconomics). 
Investigational 
periodThis portion of the study refers to the time that a subject is receiving 
treatment (investigational product or placebo). This period of t ime is when 
major interests of protocol objectives are observed and continues until the last 
assessment is completed after final administration of the investigational 
product or placebo.
Rescreen Subject can rescreen up to 1 time with approval from the me dical monitor, 
which will result in a new 35 -day screening window. The subject will be 
entered as a new subject in the interactive response technology. Subjects may 
not rescreen if the vasomotor symptoms eligibility report has been run. 
Retest Subject can retest up to 1 time with approval from the medical monitor within 
the current 35 -day screening window. The subject will retain the same subject 
identification. 
Screening A process of active consideration of potential subjects for enrollment i n a 
study.
NOTE: This is conducted after the subject signs the informed consent form 
and agrees to be evaluated for study participation.
Screen failure Potential subject who did not meet 1 or more inclusion criteria or met 1 or 
more exclusion criteria req uired for participation in a study.
Screening period Period of time before entering the investigational period, usually from the 
time when a subject signs the informed consent form until just before the test 
drug or comparative drug (sometimes without ran domization) is given to a 
subject.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Number of Subjects to be Enrolled/Randomized:   
Approximately 450 subjects will b e enrolled into this study. One hundred and fifty subjects will be 
randomized per treatment arm. 
Study Design Overview:  
This is a randomized, 12-week double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical 
study to assess the efficacy and safety of fezolinetant in women suffering from moderate to severe 
VMS associated with menopause. Approximately 450subjects will be enrolled into this s tudy, 
150subjects per treatment arm. Duration of treatment is 52 weeks. After completing 12 weeks of 
treatment, subjects on placebo will be reassigned to 30 mg or 45 mg of active treatment in a non -
controlled extension treatment period through end of study. Subjects who were already randomized on 
an active arm will continue on their assigned dose for the remaining 40 weeks of treatment. Following 
the completion (or early discontinuation [ED]) of the treatment period (week 52), subjects w ill 
complete an end of treatment (EOT; or ED) visit and final safety follow -up visit 3 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug is administered (week 55). 
This study will consist of a screening period (days -35 to -1, including the screening visit [visit 1] and 
collection of VMS frequency and severity assessments), and a 52 -week treatment period (day 1 
[visit 2] to week 52 [visit 1 5]).The study will be performed on an outpatient basis. The screening visit 
(visit 1) will occur up to 35 days prior to randomi zation (visit 2). Eligibility will be as sessed via 
physical examination; clinical laboratory testing; vital signs; electrocardiogram (ECG); Papanicolaou 
(Pap) test (or equivalent cervic al cytology ); mammography; transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) ;and 
endometri al biopsy . Endometrial biopsy will be performed at screening , at week 52/EOT , for subjects 
with uterine bleeding, and for subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion .If a 
subject discontinues from the study, an endometrial biopsy will be performed at the discontinuation 
visit along with all other EOT procedures. During treatment, any woman with an abnormal 
endometrial biopsy reported as disordered proliferative endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia or 
endometrial cancer will be referred to standard of care clinical management and followed to 
resolution, and the report of any medical or surgical procedures and the resultant pathology will be 
obtained. A mammo gram at week 52/EOT/ED will be conducted if it coincides with the regularly 
schedule d routine screening mammogram of the patient, in accordance with local medical practice 
guidelines and the patient’s primary care physician.
Subjects may be retested up to 1 time, retaining the same screening number, upon approval of the 
medical monitor wi thin the current 35 -day screening window. Subjects may be rescreened up to 1 
time, with a new screening number, upon the approval of the medical monitor, which will result in a 
new 35 -day screening window. Subjects may not rescreen if the VMS eligibility r eport has been run. 
The following assessments do not need to be repeated at the rescreen provided they fall within the 
acceptable procedure competed timeframe and all results meet inclusion and no exclusion criteria: 
TVU (acceptable 3 months from procedure ), endometrial biopsy (acceptable 3 months from 
procedure), subject has documentation of a normal/negative or no clinically significant findings 
mammo gram obtained within the prior 12 months of study enrollment (appropriate documentation 
includes a written report or an electronic report indicating normal/negative or no clinically significant 
mammo graphic findings) , ECG (acceptable 3 months from procedure) and documentation of a normal 
or not clinically significant Pap test (or equivalent cervical cytology) in the opinion of the investigator 
within the previous 12 months. Subjects who screen failed due to COVID -19 pandemic study 
suspension and ha ve adocumented evaluable endometrial biopsy from the original screening period
do not have to undergo a repeat biopsy should they decide to rescreen.
Within the 10 day sprior to randomization, subjects must have a minimum average of 7 to 
8moderate to severe hot flashes (HFs; VMS) per day , or 50 to 60 per week . Subjects are to 
recor dHFs for the entirety  of the screening period. The electr onic diary  will be reviewed by  
study  site staff at visit 2 to confirm study  eligibility .

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2During the 52 -week treatment period, subjects will return to the study site from visit 2 through 15 for 
assessments as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments. Subjects will record their VMS via their 
electronic dairy on a daily basis throughout their study participation.
Site-based PRO measures will be self -administered via an electronic device as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments . Assessments at visit 2 must occur prior to randomization/first dosing; 
assessments at we eks 4, 12, 24 and 52 must occur prior to dosing. All self -administered assessments 
willbe performed first upon arrival at the site and prior to all other procedures. In the event a subject 
withdraws from the study, efforts to collect information on the site -based PRO measures should be 
made before or shortly after discontinuation .
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and a Li ver Safety Monitoring Panel will oversee the safety of 
fezolinetant for the duration of the study.
COVID -19 Consideration:
All attempts should be made to conduct the protocol -defined scheduled visits. In cases where a 
subject is unable to visit the clinic due to site closure related to the COVID -19 pandemic, the 
following alternative measures may be implemented to ensure subject safety and continuity of care 
while participating in the study:
Telemedicine Conferences (telephone visits) to evaluate changes in a subject’s medical condition 
or medications and completion of electronic patient -reported outcome questionnaires following 
the process defined in the Notification of Pause and Screening En rollment memo released on 
27March 2020 provided to the site by the sponsor.
Safety laboratory tests collected at a local lab to include biochemistry, hematology, liver 
biochemistry and coagulation panel testing.
Subjects should be instructed to continue e ntering their hot flashes in the daily handheld diary as 
instructed regardless of site closure.
Home healthcare services may be available in cases where arrangements are made in advance by 
the site upon request from the subject(s).
Due to the nature of the Screening (visit 1), Randomization, week 0 (visit 2) and EOT/ED week 52 
(visit 15) visits, which include important study procedures, these visits must be conducted in the 
clinic. All other visits during the COVID -19 pandemic may be conducted utilizing all or some of the 
following services: home healthcare, telemedicine conferences (telephone visits) and safety laboratory 
tests collected at a local laboratory.
Subjects who screen failed due to COVID -19 pandemic study suspension and ha veadocumented
evaluab le endometrial biopsy from the original screening period do not have to undergo a repeat 
biopsy should they decide to rescreen.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Statistical Metho ds:
Sample size justification: 
A total of 450subject s are planned to be randomized; 150 subjects in each treatment arm.
For a pairwise comparison of the primary endpoint of mean daily frequency using a 2 -sample t-test at 
a 2-sided 2.5% alpha (adjusting for 2 active doses) , 120subjects would provide at least 79% power to 
detect differences from placebo of -2.0 or larger, assuming a SD of 5.
For a pairwise comparison of the primary endpoint of mean severity using a 2 -sample t -test at a 
2-sided 2.5% alpha (adjusting for 2 active doses) , 120subjects would provide at least 79% power to 
detect differences from placebo of -0.40 or larger, assuming a SD of 1 .
Assuming approximately 20% of subjects discontinue prematurely, the number of subjects will be 
increased from 120 to 150 subjects per arm.
Thissample siz e would also provide over 95 % power to detect a difference of 4.3 from placebo on the 
key secondary endpoin tof the PROMIS sleep disturbance questionnaire, using a 2 -sample t-test ata 
2-sided 2.5% alpha (adjusting for 2 active doses) assuming a SD of 7 [ Avis et al , 2016 ].
Efficacy:   
For each of the 4 co -primary efficacy endpoints, a mixed models repeated measures analysis of 
covariance (MMRM) will be used with treatment group, week, and smoking status (current vs. 
former/never) as factors, with baseline weight and baseline measurement as covariates, as well as an 
interaction of treatment by week and an interaction of baseline measurement by week, consistent with 
the hypothetical s trategy used for the estimand ,which is to compare patients as though they had 
continued on the assigned treatment . 
Comparisons between fezolinetant and placebo will be calculated based on least -squares mean 
contrasts using a 2 -tailed 95% confidence interval (CI). The family -wise type 1 error rate for the 
2active dose groups compared to placebo will be controlled using a Hochberg approach.
The PROMIS SD scale will be analyzed using MMRM, similar to the analysis of the co -primary 
endpoints.
If all the co -prima ry endpoints are statistically significant between fezolinetant and placebo at both 
doses, the statistical test will be performed on the key secondary efficacy endpoint between 
fezolinetant and placebo, using Hochberg with alpha = 0.05, as part of the fami ly-wise error rate.
Pharmacokinetics:  
Plasma concentrations of fezolinetant and metabolite ES259564 will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics by scheduled time point. Mean fezolinetant plasma concentration and mean 
metabolite ES259564 p lasma concentration will be plotted against scheduled time -point. 
Pharmacokinetics may be evaluated by a pop ulation pharmacokinetics approach. All details of 
population analyses will be described in a separate analysis plan and a separate report will be wr itten. 
When deemed necessary, data from this study may be combined with data from other studies.
Pharmacodynamics:  
Serum hormone concentration and changes from baseline will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics by scheduled time point. Mean serum hormone concentration and changes from 
baseline will be plotted against scheduled time -point. Pharmacodynamic da ta and efficacy data may 
be evaluated by a population pharmacodynamic or population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
approach. All details of population analyses will be described in a separate analysis plan and a 
separate report will be written. When deeme d necessary, data from this study may be combined with 
data from other studies.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Safety:   
Safety will be assessed by examining the incidence of adverse events, physical examinations findings, 
the clinician -administered C-SSRS, TVU’s, endometrial biopsies , vital signs, ECGs , clinical 
laboratory tests , and bone marker concentrations over time.
Interim Analysis :  
No interim analysis is planned for this study .
12-week Analysi sand 52 -week Analysis : 
Given the design, a 12 -week treatment analysis will occur to assess efficacy and safety during the 
double -blind treatment phase. This will occur after all subjects have completed 12 weeks of treatment. 
Efficacy and safety data will be analyzed, excluding the endpoints measured after 12 weeks. Since all 
primary a nd secondary analy ses only based on data through w eek 12, no alpha adjustment is required 
as the information fraction at the 12 -week analysis is 100%. 
Once the entire 52 -week study is completed and locked, additional efficacy and safety will be 
summarized without statistical comparison to placebo.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 21 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction to Fezolinetant 
Fezolinetant is a small -molecule, selective neurokinin -3 receptor (NK3R) antagonist currentl y 
being developed as an innovative non -hormonal treatment specifically  targeting the cause of 
vasomotor sy mptoms (VMS) in postmenopausal women (MR -VMS) .
For more information, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for fezolinetant.
1.2 Back ground
1.2.1 Vasomotor Symptoms (Hot Flashes): Epidemiology and Etiology
VMS, commonly  known as hot flashes (HFs) , are the most common complaint among 
women entering menopause and for many  women, may  continue to occur for up to 5 years 
(although around 20% of women will continue to experience them for up to 15 y ears) 
[Stearns et al, 2003; Rossouw e t al, 2002; Kronenb erg, 1994]. The large prospective cohort 
Study  of Women's Health Across the Nation found that overall prevalence of VMS was 
approximately  70% [Thurston & Joffe, 2011].
VMS can have a significant negative impact on quality  of life and are therefore a major 
reason for menopausal women to seek medical attention . Despite the vast numbers of 
individuals affected, the phy siology  of VMS is not fully  understood, although a disturbance 
in normal thermoregulatory  function is thought to be the main underl ying cause . The primary  
presentation of VMS is a subjective and transient sensation of heat, flushing and sweating 
that usually  lasts 4 to 10 minutes and may  be followed by  a feeling of being chilled. VMS 
may be accompanied by  palpitations, feelings of anxiety  and slee p disruption leading to 
fatigue or irritability ; in rare occurrence, panic may  occur [Kronenberg et al, 1994; 
Kronenberg et al, 1990]. The most effective and commonly  used treatment for VMS is 
hormone replacement therap y (HRT) ,but a Women’s Health Initiat ive study  raised questions 
about the long -term safety  of this treatment [Rossouw et al, 2002] . Thus, current guidelines 
recommend a limited duration of HRT due to associated risks of BC, coronary  artery  disease, 
stroke and thromboembolism [de Villiers et a l, 2016; Rossouw et al, 2002] . Furthermore, the 
current safet y data do not support the use of HRT in several groups of patients (e.g., those
with BC/endometrial cancer , liver disease) . The perceived limitations of HRT, coupled with 
the limited efficacy  and adverse effects observed with nonhormonal therapies (e.g., selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have led clinicians to search for other treatment options for 
VMS . One selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is approved in the US for the treatment of 
MR-VMS (Brisdelle ®, low dose paroxetine) . Studies of venlafaxine and fluoxetine in women 
with a prior history  of BC have suggested that certain antidepressants with the ability to 
inhibit serotonin reuptake may  significantl y reduce MR -VMS [L oprinzi et al, 20 02; L oprinzi 
et al, 2000; Stearns et al, 2000].
Over the past 20 years, a growing bod y of evidence has implicated neurokinin B (NKB) 
NK3R signaling in the etiology  of menopausal VMS . Recent advances in the field have 
demonstrated that the gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) pulse frequency  is modulated

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2by the kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dy norphin (KNDy )neurons (also known as ‘KiSS Neuron’) 
in the arcuate nucleus of the hy pothalamus [Millar & Newton, 2013] . Neuroanatomical 
studies have shown that these ne urons are sensitive to NKB/NK3R signaling [Hrabovszky , 
2014] . By study ing brain spec imens at post mortem, Rance & Young [ 1991] initially  showed 
that in postmenopausal women, hy pothalamic neurons are hy pertrophied and have increased 
NKB gene expression and neuronal activity  compared with premenopausal women . This was 
also found to be true in ovariectomized monkey s but moreover, this change could be reversed 
by treatment with sex steroid replacement thus suggesting this was a d ynamic change in 
response to red uced circulating concentrations of estradiol (E2) as occurs in the menopause 
[Rance, 2009] . Subsequent work in rats highlighted the importance of the hypothalamic 
median pre -optic nucleus in the propagation of the NKB -mediated signal that results in VMS 
[Rance et al, 2013] . The median pre -optic nucleus is a neural area that receives input from, 
and projects to, the autonomic thermoregulatory  pathway , expresses NK3R and hence results 
in activation of heat dissipation effectors that characterize VMS . Importan tly, estrogen also 
acts directl y on th e estrogen receptor alpha expressed on KNDy  neurons to decrease similarl y 
KND y neuron activity [ Ruka et al, 2016 ; Lehman et al, 2010 ]. Addit ionally , Crandall et al.
recentl y found that genetic variation in tach ykinin r eceptor 3, which is t he gene that encodes 
NK3R, may account for the variability  in experience of VMS reported amon g women 
[Crandall et al, 2017].
1.3 Fezolinetant Nonclinical and Clinical Data
1.3.1 Summary of Nonclinical Studies 
In vitro studies demonstrated that fezolinetant is a potent full inhibitor of human neurokinin 3
(hNK3) receptor and is highl y selective for hNK3 in comparison to the other members of 
tachykinin receptor family ( human neurokinin 1andhuman neurokinin ) and other G -protein 
coupled receptors including the ones known to be implicated in modulation of GnRH axis.
In vivo animal pharmacology  studies have been focused on the effects of fezolinetant on 
reproductive hormones. These studies demonstrated that fezolinetant significantly  reduces 
plasma luteinizing hormone ( LH)levels in castrate male rats at a dose range of 3 to 20 mg/kg. 
In ovariectomized female rats, fezolinetant significantly  reduced the mean plasma levels and 
pulsatile L H secretion frequency  and amplitude at 10 mg/kg dosage. Fezoline tant
significantl y reduced circulating LH levels in castrate male monkeys following single and 
5-day repeated oral dosing at 5 mg/kg per day. After 5consecutive day s of dosing, 
fezolinetant had no effect on plasma follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH)levels , 
demonstrating that antagonism of the neurokinin 3 receptor is a means to selectivel y inhibit 
LH, but not FSH. 
More information including details on the toxicological studies can be found in the IB.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 21.3.2 Summary of Clinical Studies
To date, 10 clinical studie s have been completed with fezolinetant; 6 phase 1 studies 
(ESN364 -CPK -101, ESN364 -CPK -102, ESN364 -CPK -103, 2693 -CL-0020, 2693 -CL-0006 
and 2693 -CL-0009) and 4 phase 2 studies (ESN364_HF_204, ESN364 -UF-02, ESN364 -
PCO -201 and ESN364_HF_205). Two of the 4 pha se 2 studies were performed in women 
with MR -VMS (Studies ESN364_HF_204 and ESN364_HF_205). The 10 completed studies 
with fezolinetant are shown in Table 2.
The pharma cokinetics of fezolinetant were characterized in studies in healthy  subjects and in 
patients with VMS. After orally  intake, fezolinetant showed generally  dose proportional 
pharmacokinetics at doses between 20 and 60 mg once dail y in female subjects. Peak 
concentration (C max) was generall y reached within 1 to 4 hours postdose with terminal half -
life (t 1/2) ranging between 4 to 6 hours in healthy  subjects and patients . With a once dail y 
dose regimen, stead y state in plasma concentration sare approximately  achieved b y day 2 
with minimal accumulation. Low plasma protein binding of fezolinetant (50%) was observed
with almost equal distribution of fezolinetant into red blood cells and plasma, with a 
blood -to-plasma ratio of 0.9.
Fezolinetant undergoes extensive metabolism, primarily  by CYP1A2 enz yme, to form the 
major metabolite ES259564. A strong CYP1A2 inhibitor (fluvoxamine) increased 
fezolinetant AUC and C max approximately  9-fold and1.8-fold, respectivel y,while smoking 
can decrease AUC and C max to a geometric LS mean ratio of 48.29% and71.74% , 
respectivel y (stud y 2693 -CL-0006). 
In a recentl y completed mass balance stud y (ESN364_CPK_103), the route sof excretion of 
fezolinetant were via urine (76.9 %) and feces ( 14.7%). In urine, a mean of 1.1% of the 
administered fezolinetant dose was excreted unchanged and 61.7% of the administered dose 
was excreted as metaboli te ES259564.
Fezolinetant did not show clinically  significant food effects on its pharmacokinetic exposure 
parameters (stud y ESN 364_CPK_101). Based on population pharmacokinetic modeling 
analyses, bod y weight was not identified as an important predictor of AUC. However, male 
subjects are predicted to have 53.2% reduction AUC and 14.9% reduction in C max, comparing 
to females. Asian population was predicted to have a 25% increase in steady -state C max and 
AUC , which is consistent with clinical observations (study 2693 -CL-0020).
Based on the recentl y completed relative bioavailability study (2693 -CL-0009), the tablet 
formulation showed slightly  higher pharmacokinetic exposure ( approximately  8% higher for 
AUC 0-infand 23% higher for C max) than capsule formulation.

In patients, study  ESN364_HF_204 was a 12 -week double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel -group, multicenter, proof of concept study to assess the effect of 12 -week 
administration of fezolinetant in earl y postmenopausal women suffer ing from HFs. A total of 
80 patients, 40 in each treatment group, completed the entire stud y. In this study, the mean HF 
frequency  for the moderate and severe VMS at weeks 4 and 12 reduced b y approximately  
88% and 93% from baseline compared to a placebo de crease of 38% and 46%, respectively  
(P<0.001). The mean HF score for the moderate and severe VMS at weeks 4 and 12 dropped 
approximately  89% and 94% from baseline compared to a placebo decrease of 38% and 46%, 
respectivel y (P<0.001). Most often a stati stically  significant difference between the 
fezolinetant and placebo group was observed after only  1 week of treatment, demonstrating a 
very rapid onset.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Study  ESN364_HF_205 was a 12 -week double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
multicenter, dose -ranging study  to assess the effect of 12 -week administration of once dail y 
and twice dail y doses of fezolinetant in earl y postmenopausal women suffering from HF 
(8arm stud y). A total of 356 subjects were randomized into this study  with 43 to 45 subjects 
in each treatment group. There was a clinically  relevant treatment effect observed at multiple 
doses. All groups were significantly  different from placebo with respect to mean change in 
the frequency  of moderate to severe VMS at both weeks 4 and 12. The im provement relative 
to placebo at weeks 4 and 12 was greater than 2 HF per day , indicative of a clinically  relevant 
improvement, for all dose grou ps except 15 mg twice dail y. All groups were significantl y 
different from placebo with respect to mean change i n the severit y of moderate to severe 
VMS from baseline to week 4, but only  60mg twice dail y, 90 mg twice daily  and 60 mg 
once dail y demonstrated significance at week 12 in this study .
These data provide clinical evidence that, via antagonism of increased KNDy  neuronal 
activity , fezolinetant produces a marked clinicall y significant reduction in VMS related to 
menopause and is very  likely  to exhibit similar activity  in other hy poestrogenic states such as 
occur in women undergoing hormonal treatment for BC. M ore information can be found in 
the IB. 
1.4 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
1.4.1 Nonclinical S tudies
In the non clinical toxicology  studies in rats and monkey s, fezolinet ant was well tolerated and 
the n oobserved adverse event l evel (NOAEL) was considered to be 25 mg/kg per day  in 
Cynomolgus monkey s asthe most relevant species. Drug exp osure (AUC ) at this dose level 
inCynomolgus monkey swas similar to drug exposure levels measured in premenopausal 
women dosed at 540 mg/day . The main event s that were observed in the non clinical studies 
were considered to be related to the pharmacology of fezolinetant, including reduction of the 
ovarian activity  in female monkey s.
Liver h ypertroph y without increases in alanine aminotransferase (A LT) and bilirubin seen in 
rats was related to enz yme induction since this finding coincided with thy roid follicular cell 
hypertrophy . Theliver finding is generall y regarded as not predictive for humans . The 
NOAEL was 10 mg/kg. In monkey s, no liver changes were seen.
Adverse effects were observed at the high doses used in the non clinical studies, at dose levels 
much higher than the clinical dosages . In monkey s, high doses of fezolinetant resulted in 
weight loss and a reduction in platelet counts, which resulted in obse rvations of hemorrhage 
and regenerative anemia; these effects were recoverable with discontinuation of dosing . In 
rats, very  high dose levels were associated with death and marked clinical signs and bod y 
weight loss during the first few day sof treatment.
Exposure to the main human metabolite ES259564 was evaluated in the long -term toxicity  
studies in rats and monkeys and the metabolite is considered to be toxicologically  qualified 
up to the human dose of 180 mg/day .

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Fezolinetant did not show an y genotoxic potential.
Reproductive toxicology  studies on both rats and rabbits demonstrated significant litter loss 
in both animal species; however, the surviving embryos did not show an y adverse effect on 
development. The litter loss in this case is regarded as a ph armacologic effect on the 
hormonal and reproductive status. A fertility  and earl y embr yonic development study  was 
also completed in female rats without any  reported adverse events (AEs; 
NOAEL =100mg/kg per day ).
1.4.2 Clinical Studies
The most frequentl y repor ted treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
(i.e., in > 2 subjects [> 33.3%] per treatment group) following multiple ascending dosing for 
21 day s in healthy  female subjects in the first in human study  (ESN364 -CPK -101) were: 
abdominal pain in 3 (50.0%) s ubjects each in placebo and in 180 mg fezolinetant treatment 
groups, nausea in 3 (50.0%) subjects in the 20 mg fezolinetant treatment group, headache in 
3(50.0%) and 4 (66.7%) subjects in the 60 and 180 fezolinetant treatment groups, 
respectivel y, and dry skin in 3 (50.0%) subjects in the 180 mg fezolinetant treatment group. 
The events of nausea and headache were onl y reported in the 20, 60 and/or 180 mg 
fezolinetant treatment groups and not in the placebo group. Clinical observations related to 
sex hormon es were due to the mode of action of the investigational medicinal product: 
fezolinetant resulted in prolongation of the menstrual cy cle in females for the first cy cle after 
dosing for the 60 mg and 180 mg dose levels, with a median change from baseline of 7.5 and 
9.5 day s, respectively . Once withdrawn from the study  drug, the normal menstrual cy cle 
resumed immediatel y with cycle lengths comparable to the pre -dose menstrual cy cle.
The most frequent TEAEs (in > 2 [12.5%] subjects in the fezolinetant total gr oup [16 subjects]) 
in the single dose Part 1 of the subsequent dose ranging phase 1 study  (ESN364 -CPK -102), 
were headache, paraesthesia and nausea. The highest incidence for headache was after 360 and 
900mg intake, for paraesthesia after 540 and 900 mg in take and for nausea after 900 mg 
intake. A severe headache was reported after 900 mg fezolinetant intake. Based on the results 
from Part 1, the maximum tolerated dose was considered to be 900 mg based on the occurrence 
of AEs (oral paraesthesia and severe headache). In the multiple dose administration (7 day s) 
Part 2 in healthy  female volunteers, the most frequent TEAEs (in > 2 [16.7%] subjects in the 
fezolinetant total group [540 and 720 mg combined]) were headache (4 [33.3%] subjects) and 
vaginal hemorrha ge (3 [25.0%] subjects). I n the single dose administration Part 3 in healthy  
male volunteers, the most frequent TEAE (in > 2 [28.6%] subjects in the fezolinetant total 
treatment groups [720 and 900 mg]) was oral paraesthesia (3 [42.9%] subjects).
The most frequentl y reported TEAEs in the phase 2a study  (ESN364_HF_204) reported in 
>2 patients in the fezolinetant group [90 mg bid]) were headache, palpitations, diarrhea and 
influenza. All TEAEs were at most moderate in severity . Treatment -related TEAEs were 
reported in 13 (30.2%) patients in the fezolinetant group and in 11 (25.0%) patients in the 
placebo group. Most treatment -related TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal 
discomfort, diarrhea and oral paraesthesia) reported in 6 (14.0%) patients in the fezolinetant 
group and 0 patients in the placebo group. Two patients discontinued treatment in the

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2fezolinetant group (for 1 patient due to the TEAE fibromy algia, depression, dry  mouth, 
headache, palpitations, diarrhea and vomiting: and for 1 patient d ue to the TEAE headache 
and vertigo). None of the subjects in the placebo group permanently  stopped the study  
medication due to a TEAE.
In the phase 2b ESN364_HF_205 stud y, overall fezolinetant was well-tolerated. During this 
study , the rates of TEAEs were comparable across all groups and most events were mild or 
moderate in severity . No deaths or treatment related SAEs were reported. The most common 
MedDRA SOCs (≥ 10% patients in any  arm) in which TEAEs were reported were: 
gastrointestinal disorders, infec tions and infestations, general disorders and administration 
site conditions, investigations, nervous sy stem disorders and skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders.
The active dose groups had a higher proportion of TEAEs reported as drug -related, but onl y 
2patients had severe drug -related TEAEs. TEAEs leading to discontinuations were reported 
in small numbers of patients across the treatment groups. A total of 5 patients discontinued 
due to changes in liver enzy mes following ESN364; no discontinuations due t o changes in 
liver enzy mes occurred following placebo treatment.
Of the TEAEs of special interest, there was 1 patient with oral paresthesia (in the 30 mg bid 
group) and a few isolated cases of uterine bleeding with no reports of endometrial hyperplasia. 
There were 9 patients with AL T or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 3 ×ULN. Of these, 
3patients had ALT or AST > 8 ×ULN (60 mg bid, 90 mg bid and 60 mg qd). There were no 
cases of total bilirubin (TBL) > 2 ×ULN, and consequently  no Hy ’s law cases.
There were no clinicall y meaningful changes in hematology , coagulation, vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), bone turnover markers, endometrial assessments or suicide status.
Overall in the clinical program to date, including indications other than MR -VMS, 
7treatment -emergent SAEs have been reported. These SAEs were assessed as not related to 
the study  medication, except for a case of superficial thrombophlebitis reported in the phase 
2a study  in pol ycystic ovary  syndrome (ESN364 -PCO -201), which was assesse d by the 
investigator as possibly  related to the study  medication: the study  drug was interrupted and 
reinitiated after the event had resolved, with no recurrence of the event. 
Given the limited safet y information with fezolinetant, there areno expected serious adverse 
reactions (SARs) at the start of the phase 3 program .For up -to-date information regarding 
expected SARs, refer to the Reference Safet y Information (RSI ). The RSI  for fezolinetant is 
contained in the IB, Section 5.3.2 Expected Serious Adver se Drug Reactions.
1.5 Risk  Benefit Assessment
Fezolinetant is currentl y being developed for the treatment of VMS associated with the 
menopause (MR -VMS).
Based on recent advances in science ,as well as the clinical data derived from 2 p hase 
2clinical studies in women with VMS associated with the menopause, there are positive 
reasons to believe that fezolinetant can be an effective treatment for MR -VMS.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2When given to normall y cycling healthy  women, fezolinetant is capable of altering the 
menstrual cy cle and de creasing the circulating levels of E2, LH, progesterone (P4) and 
testosterone. Since this study  aims to include menopausal women, these effects will be of less 
importance because of the phy siological changes that happen in the climacterium 
(anovulation wit h loss of P4 and E2 production, and consequentl y increase of LH/FSH).
In terms of hormonal changes, a mild to moderate decrease of the alread y elevated LH and 
FSH plasma levels is anticipated. There are no known risks associated with this decrease of 
the g onadotropins in menopausal women. 
Treatment with fezolinetant can cause adverse effects or other s ymptoms. Adverse effects 
that can be expected are those AEs that presented in fezolinetant clinical studies in healthy  
male and female volunteers ,as well as in menopausal women. 
Details of the AE profile from the completed clinical studies are presented in [Section 1.3
Fezolinetant Nonclinical and Clinical Data ]. 
Across the completed phase 1 and 2a studies, there have been a small number of mild, 
transitory  transaminase elevations observed both in patients /subjects who received either 
fezolinetant or placebo. There were no incidences of raised TBL and none of the 
patients/subjects experienced associated s ymptoms. I n the recently  completed phase 2b study  
ESN364_HF_205, transitory  increases in transaminase en zymes, ALT/AST, have been 
reported in 7 subjects between 4 and 8 weeks after start of study  treatment and in 2 unique 
subjects during stud y follow -up. Subjects were as ymptomatic throughout and there was no 
evidence of functional liver impairment. Although there were cases with evidence of 
significant underl ying hepatic conditions and other confounding factors, independent expert 
review concluded that the study  drug was probably  the cause of the increased transaminase 
levels. In all cases, transaminase enzy me levels rapidly  decreased, in 2 cases during 
continuing treatment with study  medication. 
Based on cases of increased AST and ALT above 5 × ULN in the phase 2b study  
ESN364_HF_205 that were assessed b y external hepatic experts as related to the use of 
fezolinetant, liver injury  has been categorized as an important potential risk. Monitoring of 
liver parameters is incorporated in the design of this protocol, including individual patient 
stopping rules and liver assessment per Section 12.4. Increased transaminases have not been 
observed at the dose selected for the phase 3 studies (i.e., 30 mg fezolinetant qd). 
Severe thrombocy topenia has been reported in non -clinica l studies but not in clinical studies 
and has been categorized as an important potential risk. To date, 1 clinical case of mild, 
pre-existing, thrombocy topenia has been reported (in phase 2a study  ESN364_HF_204). 
Platelet counts are included in the hematol ogical monitoring during the course of the stud y.
Circumoral paresthesia has been reported b y several subjects taking fezolinetant . Considering 
the reported cases in the phase 1 studies (ESN364 -CPK -101 and ESN364 -CPK -102) the
occurrence of circumoral pares thesia is dose dependent for both intensity  and duration, 
usually  starting within the first hour after drug intake, relatively  short -lasting, with higher 
doses leading to a more intense and prolonged sensation. This ty pe of paresthesia has been

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2described a s either plain paresthesia (oral, fa cial skin, tongue, scalp and/or lips), as a 
prickling sensation of the face, as a numbness of the tongue or as a tingling sensation (face, 
mouth and/or tongue). 
Circumoral paraesthesia has been recognized in the phase 1 and 2 clinical studies and 
categorized as a non -important identified risk. No specific additional monitoring is 
recommended.
Overall, the potential benefits of subjects receiving 30 mg or 45 mg once daily  fezolinetant 
are considered to outweigh the poten tial risks. Although an important medical condition, 
VMS are not considered life -threatening and 12 week placebo treatment, which also is 
associated with improvement in VMS, is justifiable.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Eligibility  will be assessed via phy sical examination; clinical laboratory  testing; vital signs; 
ECG; Papanicolaou (Pap) test (or equivalent cervical cy tology ); mammography ; transvaginal 
ultrasound (TVU); and endometrial biopsy . Endometrial biopsy  will be performed at 
screening and at week 52/EOT, for subjects with uterine bleeding, and for subjects who are 
withdrawn from the study prior to completion . If a subject discontinues from the study , an 
endometrial biopsy  will be performed at the discontinuation visit along with all other EOT 
procedures. During treatment, a ny woman with an abnormal endometrial biopsy  reported as 
disordered proliferative endomet rium, endometrial hy perplasia or endometrial cancer will be 
referred to standard of care clinical management and followed to resolution, and the report of 
any medical or surgical procedures and the resultant pathology  will be obtained. A 
mammogram at week 52/EOT /EDwill be conducted if it coincides with the regularl y 
scheduled routine screening mammogram of the patient, in accordance with local medical 
practice guidelines and the patient’s primary  care phy sician.
Subjects may  be retested up to 1 time, retai ning the same screening number, upon approval of 
the medical monitor within the 35 -day screening window. Subjects may  be rescreened up to 
1time, with a new screening number , upon the approval of the medical monitor , which will 
result in a new 35 -day scree ning window . Subjects may  not rescreen if the VMS eligibility  
report has been run. The following assessments do not need to be repeated at the rescreen 
provided they  fallwithin the acceptable procedure competed timeframe and all results meet 
inclusion and no exclusion criteria: TVU (acceptable 3 months from procedure), endometrial 
biopsy  (acceptable 3months from procedure), subject has documentation of a normal/negative 
or no clinically  significant findings mammogram obtained within the prior 12 months of study  
enrollment (appropriate documentation includes a written report or an electronic report 
indicating normal/negative or no clinicall y significant mammographic findings), ECG 
(acceptable 3 months from procedure) and documentation of a normal or not cli nically  
significant Pap test (or equivalent cervical cy tology ) in the opinion of the investigator within 
the previous 12 months. Subjects who screen failed due to COVID -19 pandemic study  
suspension and have a documented evaluable endometrial biopsy  from th e original screening 
period do not have to undergo a repeat biopsy  should they  decide to rescreen.
Within the 10 day s prior to randomization, subjects must have a minimum average of 7 to 
8moderate to severe HFs (VMS) per day , or 50 to 60 per week. Subject s are to record HFs 
for the entiret y of the screening period. The electronic diary  will be reviewed by  study  site 
staff at visit 2 to confirm study  eligibility . 
During the 52 -week treatment period, subjects will return to the study  site from visit 2 through 
visit 15 for assessments as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments [ Table 1]. Subjects will 
record their VMS via their electronic dairy  on a daily  basis thro ughout their study  participation.
Site-based PRO measures will be self -administered via an electronic device as indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments [ Table 1]. Ass essments at visit 2 must occur prior to 
randomization/first dosing; assessments at weeks 4, 12, 24 and 52 must occur prior to dosing. 
All self -administered assessments will be performed first upon arrival at the site and prior to 
all other procedures. In t he event a subject withdraws from the stud y, efforts to collect

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2information on the site -based PRO measures should be made before or shortly  after 
discontinuation.
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and a Liver Safet y Monitoring Panel will oversee the 
safet yof fezolinetant for the duration of the study .
COVID -19 Consideration:
All attempts should be made to conduct the protocol -defined scheduled visits. I n cases where 
a subject is unable to visit the clinic due to site closure related to the COVID -19pandem ic, 
the following alternative measures may  be implemented to ensure subject safety  and 
continuity  of care while participating in the study:
●Telemedicine Conferences (telephone visits) to evaluate changes in a subject’s medical 
condition or medications and completion of electronic patient -reported outcome 
questionnaires following the process defined in the Notification of Pause and Screening 
Enrollment memo released on 27 March 2020 provided to the site by  the sponsor.
●Safety  laboratory  tests collected at a local lab to include biochemistry , hematology , liver 
biochemistry  and coagulation panel testing.
●Subjects should be instructed to continue entering their hot flashes in the daily  handheld 
diary  as instructed regardless of site closure.
●Home healthcare serv ices may  be available in cases where arrangements are made in 
advance b y the site upon request from the subject(s).
Due to the nature of the Screening (visit 1), Randomization, week 0 (visit 2) and EOT/ED 
week 52 (visit 15) visits, which include important study  procedures, these visits must be 
conducted in the clinic. All other visits during the COVID -19 pandemic may  be conducted 
using all or some of the following services: home healthcare, telemedicine conferences 
(telephone visits) and safety  laboratory  tests collected at a local laboratory .
Subjects who screen failed due to COVID -19 pandemic study  suspension and have a 
documented evaluable endometrial biopsy  from the original screening period do not have to 
undergo a repeat biopsy  should they  decide to re screen.
2.2.2 Dose Rationale
A phase 2b dose -ranging study  (ESN364_HF_205 ) assessing the effects of the potent and 
selective NK3 antagonist, fez olinetant, on VMS in post -menopausal females was recently  
completed. 
From the ESN364_HF_205 study , 352 subjects were randomized and received at least 1 dose 
of study  drug, 287 (81%) completed the study  (placebo: 84%; fezolinetant: 80%). 
Discontinuations occurred most commonly  for withdrawal of consent (6.7%) and AEs (5.9%). 
The 4 co -primary  efficacy  endpoints for ESN364 _HF_205 included the mean change in 
frequency  and severit y of moder ate-to-severe VMS at week 4 and w eek 12. VMS frequency  
and severit y at weeks 4 and 12 were reduced in all fezolinetant groups. Differences from 
placebo in least squares mean changes from ba seline in VMS daily  frequency  at week 4 
were -1.9, -3.0, -2.8 and -3.5 for 15, 30, 60 and 90 mg twice daily  and -2.3, -3.0and -2.4 for

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 230, 60 and 120 mg once daily , respectivel y (common SE: 0.8; all P <0.05, from a pairwise 
comparison against placebo wit hout multiplicity  adjustment) . Differences at week 12 
were -1.8, -2.1, -2.3, -2.6 and -2.1, -2.6, -2.1, respectivel y (common SE: approximately  0.7; 
all P<0.05 from a pairwise comparison against placebo without multiplicity adjustment) . 
The impr ovement re lative to placebo at w eeks 4 and 12 was greater than 2, indicative of a 
clinically  meaningful improvement, for all dose groups except 15 mg twice daily . For HF
severit y, all treatment groups were statisticall y signific ant compared to placebo at week 4, 
while only  the 60 mg twice dail y, 90 mg twice daily  and 60 mg once dail ywere statistic ally 
different from placebo at w eek 12. Unlike frequency , a clinicall y meaningful improvement in 
HFseverity  hasnot been established. 
Fezolinetant was generally  well -tolerated . No deaths or treatment -related serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were reported . The rates of TEAE s were comparable across groups an d were 
mostly  mild and moderate; however, overall the active dose groups had a higher proportion 
of AEs reported as treatment -related assessed b y the site investigators . Nine subject s had 
ALT or AST elevations > 3 ×ULN. There were no cases of total bilirubin > 2 ×ULN. Seven 
of the 9 su bjects with transaminase elevations received total daily  doses o f 120 mg or greater.
A relationship between fezolinetant exposure (dose and concentration) and the incidence of 
liver parameter elevations appear sto be present. Individual predicted exposures for subjects 
with transaminase elevations > 3 × ULN were compared to the broader distribution of 
fezolinetant exposure by  treatment group. Subjects with AL T or AST elevations > 3 × ULN 
generall y had stead y-state C max and C avgconcentrations toward the hig her end of the 
distribution for each dose group. Most cases of ALT or AST elevations > 3 × ULN occurred 
at fezolinetant exposures anticipated from 120 mg total daily  doses or higher. Two subjects 
receiving a 60 mg total daily  dose (1 in 30 mg bid and 1 in 60mg qd) experienced ALT or 
AST elevations > 3 × ULN. The subject in the 60 mg once dail y dose group had an average 
concentration consistent with the 75% percentile of exposure for the 120 mg total dail y dose. 
The transaminase elevation for the subject in the 30 mg twice daily  group occurred at the 
follow -up visit, 3 weeks after the last dose. The subject had normal liver parameters 
throughout the stud y and the elevation was considered to be unlikel y related to study  drug.
Dose -and concentration -response models were developed to identify  the minimum effective 
dose and the exposure -response relationship. Both the dose -response ( Multiple Comparison 
Procedure –Modeling ) and concentration -response (nonlinear mixed -effects models) 
analyses demonstrated increas ed improvements in HFfrequency  and HFseverity  with 
increasing fezolinetant exposure. No clinically  relevant difference was noted between 
predicted efficacy  (frequency  or severit y) for the once dail y and twice daily regimen given
the same total daily  dose .
Modeling and simulation suggests that although baseline does not impact the percentage 
reduction in HF frequency, it does impact the placebo -corrected change from baseline. In 
Study  ESN364_HF_205, subjects were eligible for enrollment if they  experienced more than 
an average 7 hot flashes per day  over a week during the screening period. However, during 
the specific baseline period used for the anal ysis purpose, the same criterions was not

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2required. This resulted in a decreased mean baseline compared to hi storical studies. At 
week 12, the model predicts a mean placebo -corrected change from baseline reduction in HF 
frequency  of -1.74 and -1.95 for the 30 mg once -daily  and 45 mg once -daily  doses, 
respectivel y, at a mean baseline of 9.5 hot flashes per day. At a mean baseline more 
consistent with historical studies, the mean predicted placebo -corrected change from baseline 
reduction in HF frequency for 30 mg and 45 mg once -daily doses is -2.11 and -2.37, 
respectivel y, at week 12. In summary , once daily  doses of ≥ 30 mg are predicted to have 
clinically  meaningful population mean reductions in HF frequency  based on historical 
baseline values. For HF severit y based on the moderate and severe hot flashes, the model 
predicted placebo -corrected change from baseline fo r 30mg and 45 mg once -daily doses was 
-0.34 and -0.41, respectively , at week 12 .Based on these predicted reductions in hot flash 
severit y and the increased sample size planned in the phase 3 studies, these proposed doses 
are anticipated that a statistica lly significant reduction in hot flash severity  can be achieved 
compared to placebo.
In addition to the dose -and exposure -response analy ses, DILIs ym modeling was undertaken 
to better characterize and understand the increase in elevated transaminases note d for 
9subjects in Study  ESN364 _HF_205 and the potential for drug -induced liver injury  (DILI). 
DILIs ym predicted no cases of elevated transaminases greater than 3 -times the upper limit of 
normal for the 30 mg, 45mg, or 60 mg once -daily treatment regimens .
Based on the efficacy  results and modeling and simulation analy ses, the 30 mg once -daily 
dosing regimen is considered the lowest effective dose. In addition, a 45 mg once -daily dose, 
while not previously  studied, is predicted to increase the probability  of achieving efficacy  
endpoints while limiting the risk of potential exposure related transaminase elevations and 
DILI.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 24.3 Study Drug Handling 
Current ICH GCP Guidelines require the investigator to ensure that study  drug deliveries 
from the sponsor are received by  the investigator/or designee a nd that:
●Such deliveries are recorded,
●Study  drug is handled and stored according to labeled storage conditions,
●Study  drug with appropriate expiry /retest and is only  dispensed to study  subjects in 
accordance with the protocol, and
●Any unused study  drug is returned to the sponsor.
Study  drug inventory  and accountabil ity records will be kept by  theinvestigator or designee. 
Study  drug accountability  throughout the study  must be documented and reconciled. The 
following guidelines are therefore pertinent:
●The investigator agrees not to supply  study  drugs to any  persons except the eligible 
subjects in this study  in accordance with the protocol.
●The investigator or designee will keep the stud y drugs in a pharmacy  or other locked and 
secure storage facility  under controlled storage conditions, accessible only  to those 
authorized by  the investigator to dispense these study  drugs.
●A study  drug inventory  will be maintained by  the investigator or designee . The inventory  
will include details of material received and a c lear record of when they  were dispensed 
and to which subject.
●At the conclusi on or termination of this study , the investigator or designee agrees to 
conduct a final drug supply  inventory  and to record the results of this inventory  on the 
Drug Accountabilit y Record. I t must be possible to reconcile delivery  records with those 
of used and/or returned study  drug. Any  discrepancies must be accounted for and 
documented. Appropriate forms of deliveries and returns must be signed b y the site staff 
delegated this r esponsibility .
●The site staff must return study  drug to the sponsor or designee at the end of the study  or 
upon expiration unless otherwise approved b y the sponsor.
4.4 Blinding
4.4.1 Blinding Method 
The first 12 weeks of the study  are double blind . Subjects will b e randomized to receive 
fezolinetant or placebo in a blinded fashion such that the investigator, sponsor’s study  
management team, clinical staff, nor the subject will know which agent is being 
administered. The randomization number will be assigned based o n information obtained 
from the Interactive Response Technology  (IRT).
4.4.2 Confirmation of the Indistinguishability of the Study Drugs
The appearance and the form of both the drug and packaging of the fezolinetant are identical 
to those of their matching place bo.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 24.4.3 Retention of the Assignment Schedule and Procedures for Treatment Code 
Breaking 
The randomization list and study  medication blind will be maintained by  the IRTsystem.
4.4.4 Breaking the Treatment Code for Emergency 
The treatment code for each randomized subject will be provided by  the IRT in the event of a 
medical emergency  requiring knowledge of the treatment assigned to the subject. The IRT 
will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions that may  only be requested by the 
investigator or subinvestiga tors designated to have access to perform blind -break. In case of a 
medical emergency , the investigator has the sole responsibility  for determining if unblinding 
of subject’s treatment assignment is warranted. Subject safet y must always be the first 
consid eration in making such determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the investigator should make every  effort to contact the sponsor prior to 
unblinding a subject’s treatment assignment unless this could delay  emergency  treatmen t for 
the subject. 
The investigator must have confirmed functionality to access code -break through the IRT 
system and must have a designated back up (e.g. ,redundant processes) to support emergency  
unblinding requirements. 
Prior to randomization, subjects should be provided with information that includes the site 
emergency  contact number and back -up contact number in case of a medical emergency . Any 
unblinding by  the investigational staff must be reported immediately  to the sponsor and 
include an explanation of why  the study  drug was unblinded. If unblinding is associated with 
anSAE the investigator is to follow the instructions in [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of S erious 
Adverse Events ]. 
Care should be taken to limit knowledge of the randomization arm, in case this could affect 
the blinding o f other subjects or future study assessment for the subject. 
4.4.5 Breaking the Treatment Code by the Sp onsor 
The sponsor may  break the treatment code for subjects who experience a suspected 
unexpected serious adverse r eaction (SUSAR), in order to determine if the individual case or 
a group of cases requires expedited re gulatory  reporting. Individual emerge ncy codes will be 
provided to the limited staff who are responsible to break the codes for all SUSAR cases for 
reporting purposes.
4.5 Assignment and Allocation
Subje cts will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to a treatment arm according to the 
randomization sche dules and stratified b y smoking status (active smoker or non -smoker) 
through IRT. Subjects who complete the 12 -week treatment period and received placebo will 
be randomized to either fezolinetant 30 mg or 45 mg. The extension period will remain 
blinded to the site personnel and participating subjects. The site personne l will dispense the 
treatment according to the I RT s ystem’s assignment. Specific procedures for randomization 
through the IRT are contained in the study  procedures manual.

5.3.1 Efficacy Assessment
5.3.1.1 Vasomotor Symptom Diary
Daily  HFdata will be collect ed using an electronic HF diary  [Section 8.1Data Collection], 
which should be completed daily  by study participants from screening (visit 1) through the 
follow -up visit (visit 16). The HF diary  is a validated, interactive, real -time vendor hosted 
system available for use 24 hours per d ay for data entry . This electronic diary  will be the onl y 
source document for the 4 co -primary endpoints. Subjects will be provided with a reference 
guide within the diary , which includes the definitions of mild, moderate and severe HF s. These 
definitions are as follows [ FDA Guidance for Industry, 2003 ]: 
●Mild: sensation of heat without sweating
●Moderate: sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity
●Severe: sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity
The real -time sy stem wil l generate daily  compliance reports for each subject. The compliance 
reports tabulate the date and time of each HF entry and the number of HF s entered at each 
time poin t.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 25.3.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Assessment
The PROMI S is a National I nstitute sof Health Roadmap initiative designed to improve PRO
measures using state -of-the-science methods. The PROMI SSD SF 8b [PROMI S SD, 2015] 
assesses self -reported sleep disturbance over the past 7days and includes perceptions of 
restless sleep; satisfaction with sleep; refreshing sleep; difficulties sleeping, getting to sleep 
or stay ing asleep; amount of sleep; and sleep quality . Because it assesses the patient’s 
experience of sleep disturbance, the measure does not focus on specific sleep -disorder 
symptoms o r ask patients to report objective measures of sleep (e.g., total amoun t of sleep, 
time to fall asleep and amount of wakefulness during sleep) . Responses to each of the 8 items 
range from 1 to 5, and the range of possible summed raw scores is 8 to 40. High er scores on 
the PROMI SSD SF 8b indicate more of the concept measured ( disturbed sleep ).
Subjects will complete the PROMI SSD SF 8b electronicall y via a tablet at each site and 
without assistance from any one else. This instrument will be self -administered ; prox y 
responses will not be allowed.
While administration time for the PROMIS SD SF 8b has not been quantified, it is 
anticipated that the measure can be completed in approximately  2 minutes. I n a study  of 
patients with sy stemic sclerosis [Khanna et al, 2012], 11 PROMI S item banks, including the 
SD item bank, were administered via computerized adaptive test (CAT). The average number 
of items completed for each CAT -administered item bank ranged from 5 to 8, and the 
average time to complete each CAT -adminis tered item bank ranged from 48 seconds to 
1.9minutes per subject (average time = 11.9 minutes per subject for 11 banks) [Khanna et al, 
2012]. The expected administration time of approximately  2 minutes is also in line with the 
‘rule of thumb’ that 3 to 5 items can be completed per minute [Hay s & Reeve, 2008]. The 
PROMI S SD SF 8b should take approximately 2 minutes to complete.
Due to the electronic administration of this PRO, risk for missing data is mitigated.
5.3.3 Patient -reported Outcome Assessment s
The foll owing PROs will be self -administered electronicall y at the site visit:
●PROMI S SD SF 8b –assesses sleep disturbance
●PROMI S SRI  SF 8a –assesses sleep -related impairment
●PGI scales –assess patient -perceived global impressions of severit y in sleep disturban ce 
and change in VMS and sleep disturbance 
●MENQOL –assesses quality  of life as it relates to menopausal s ymptoms
●EQ-5D-5L –assesses general health -related quality  of life
●WPAI -VMS –assesses VMS -related work productivity  and activity  impairment
All PRO measures will be administered in the local language. Onl y questionnaires provided 
by Astellas that have been linguistically  validated and cognitively  debriefed in the target 
language to which they  have been translated will be used in this study .
All PRO me asures will be self -administered at the site and prior to performing all other 
procedures including the C -SSRS.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2All sites and site personnel will undergo training to assist with any  technology  issues that 
arise due to electronic administration. Personnel will be trained on the acceptability  of 
defining terms for subjects if necessary ; however, they  will be instructed to not define a 
concept where the respondent’s subjective interpretation is required (e.g., “my  sleep qualit y”). 
Site personnel will be inst ructed to have subjects complete the PRO measures in a quiet room, 
to complete all questions before leaving the room and to read the instructions provided. After 
completion, subjects will be asked to confirm their responses.
5.3.3.1 Patient Global Impression Scale
The PGI is comprised of 2 companion 1 -item PRO measures analogous to the Clinical Global 
Impression (CGI) scales [Busner J & Targum SD, 2007]. These measures provide brief, 
stand -alone global assessments prior to and after initiating a study  medication. T he Patient 
Global I mpression evaluates the following: (a) patient -perceived s everity  of a condition 
(PGI -S) and (2) patient -perceived change from the initiation of treatment (PGI -C). In this 
study , PGI scales will be used to evaluate meaningful within -person changes over time in 
VMS (PGI -C) and sleep disturbance (PGI -S and PGI -C).
The PGI -C VMS asks: “Compared to the beginning of this study , how would y ou rate y our 
HFs/night sweats now?” Subject ratings range from (1) much better to (7) much worse. The 
PGI-C SD asks: Compared to the beginning of this study , how well are you sleeping now?” 
Subject ratings range from (1) much better to (7) much worse. The PGI -S SD asks: “How 
would y ou rate the severity  of an y problems you currentl y have while sleeping at night ?” 
Subject ratings range from (1) no problems to (4) severe problems. 
Each PGI measure should take less than 1 minute to complete. Due to the electronic 
administration of these PROs, risk for missing data is mitigated.
5.3.3.2 PROMIS SRI SF 8a
The PROMI S SRI SF 8 a [PROMI S Sleep -Related Impairment, 2015] is an 8 -item PRO 
measure that evaluates self -reported perceptions of alertness, sleepiness and tired ness during 
usual waking hours and the perceived functional impairments during wakefulness associated 
with sleep p roblems or impaired alertness. Though this measure does not directly  assess 
cognitive, affective or performance impairment, it does measure waking alertness, sleepiness 
and function within the context of overall sleep -wake function. The PROMIS SRI SF 8a is a 
universal rather than disease -specific instrument, and has a 7 -day recall period.
Responses to each of the 8 items on the PROMI S SRI  SF 8a range from 1 to 5, and the range 
of possible summed raw scores is 8 to 40. Higher scores indicate more of the conc ept 
measured (sleep -related impairment).
The PROMI S SRI SF 8a should take up to 2 minutes to complete. Due to the electronic 
administration of this PRO, risk for missing data is mitigated.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 25.3.3.3 MENQOL
The MENQOL is a 29 -item PRO measure that assesses the impact of 4 domains of 
menopausal s ymptoms, as experienced over the last week: vasomotor (items 1 to 3), 
psychosocial (items 4 to 10), phy sical (items 11 to 26) and sexual (items 27 to 29). I tems 
pertai ning to a specific sy mptom are rated as present or not present, and if present, how 
bothersome on a zero (not bothersome) to 6 (extremely  bothersome) scale [Lewis et al, 2005]. 
Each item score ranges from 1 to 8, and each domain is scored separatel y; each domain mean 
ranges from 1 to 8 [L ewis et al, 2005; Hilditch et al, 1996]. The overall questionnaire score is 
the mean of the domain means. Higher scores represent more bothersome menopausal 
symptoms.
The questionnaire should take, on average, 7 minutes t o complete with a range of 5 to 
15minutes based on the original English and French Canadian pre -tests [Lewis et al, 2005; 
Hilditch et al, 1996].
5.3.3.4 EQ-5D-5L with V isual Analog Scale
The EQ -5D-5L is a 5 -item standardized measure of health status that provides a simple, 
generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal [EuroQol Research Foundation, 
2018 ; van Reenen & Janssen, 2015 ]. This PRO measure comprises 5 dimensions: mobility , 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression . Each dimension has 
5levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme 
problems. The subject is asked to indicate her health state by  selecting the most appropriate 
statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision r esults in a 1 -digit number that expresses 
the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 
5-digit number that describes the patient’s health state.
The EQ -5D VAS is a subject -reported measure that records the r espondent’s self -rated health 
on a vertical VAS where the endpoint is labeled ‘Best imaginable health state’ and ‘Worst 
imaginable health state .’The scale ranges from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates the subject is in 
her best possible health state and 0 ind icates the subject is in her worst possible health state. 
Subjects mark an ‘X’ on the scale to rate their health status that day .
This measure should take approximately  2 minutes to complete. Due to the electronic 
administration of this PRO, risk for missi ng data is mitigated.
5.3.3.5 WPAI -VMS
The WPAI -VMS is a 6 -item PRO measure that examines VMS -related work productivity  and 
activity  in the preceding 7 day s [Reilly  Associates, 2013; Reily  et al, 1993]. I t consists of 
4domains: absenteeism (the percentage of work time missed bec ause of VMS in the past 
7days), presenteeism (the percentage of impairment experien ced while at work in the past 
7days because of VMS), overall work productivity  loss (overall work impairment measured 
by combining absenteeism and presente eism to determine the total percentage of missed 
time) and activity  impairment (the percentage of impairment in daily  activities because of

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2VMS in the past 7 day s). If the subject is unemploy ed, onl y 2 of the 6 items on this 
questionnaire require completio n.
WPAI -VMS outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers 
indicating greater impairment and less productivity  (i.e., worse outcomes) [Reilly  Associates, 
2013].
The WPAI -VMS should take 2 minutes to complete. Due to the electronic ad ministration of 
this PRO, risk for missing data is mitigated.
5.3.4 Pharmacodynamic Assessments
Venous blood samples will be collected for pharmacod ynamic assessments starting at day 1 
(visit 2), through week 52 (visit 15/EOT) and at the follow -up visit (week 55 [visit 16]). 
Pharmacod ynamic samples will be taken predose at day 1 (visit 2) , week 12 (v isit 5), week 
16 (visit 6), week 24 (visit 8) and week 52 (visit 15) , as well as predose and 3 hours postdose 
at week 4 (visit 3). The week 4 (visit 3) 3 hours postd ose pharmacod ynamic sample should be 
shifted to a later date (prior to week 12) in case the subject cannot accommodate the sampling 
schedule at that visit. The pharmacod ynamic sample should be taken at the same time as the 
3-hour postdose pharmacokinetic s ample. A pharmacod ynamic sample will be taken at the 
follow -up visit (w eek 55 [visit 16]),as well. Markers include LH, FSH, E2, SHBG, 
androstenedione, deh ydroepiandrosterone, estrone and testosterone. 
The exact date and time of blood sampling must be rec orded in the source documents and on 
the eCRF. Serum will be collected and handled as specified in the central laboratory  manual. 
After appropriate labeling, the serum samples will be stored below -20°C at the study  site. 
Thereafter, the frozen samples wil l be transported/shipped on dry  ice to the central laboratory  
for collection and storage below -20°C until analy sis.
Further procedures for sample collection, shipment, processing and storage are described in 
the laboratory  manual.
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Venous blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analy sis of fezolinetant and 
metabolite ES259564 in plasma predose, 1 h (±30 min) postdose and3 h (±30 min) 
postdose at week 4 (visit 3) and week 16 (visit 6) , as well as predose wee k 12 (visit 5), 
week 24 (visit 8) and week 52 (visit 15) [see Table 1Schedule of Assessments]. The 
indicated time windows for week 4 (visit 3) pharmacokinetic samplin g will allow for 
flexibility .If this visit is missed, the samples can be taken at the next visit . 
A predose PK collection will be obtained for an y subjects with signal of elevated 
transaminases (> 3 × ULN) during their visit for repeat blood draw. The sa mple will be held 
for potential anal ysis based on the patient’s clinical outcome.
The exact date and time of the pharmacokinetic sampling must be recorded in the source 
documents and on the eCRF, as well as the exact time of last drug intake before the sam ples 
were taken. This means that for a predose blood sample, the time of the morning drug intake

Further pro cedures fo r sample collection, shipment, processing, and storage are described in 
the laboratory  manua l. 
5.3.6 Pharmacogenomic sample
While pharmacogenomic (PGx) sampling is scheduled for week 4 (visit 3), PGx sample can 
be taken at an y time during the stud y after signed ICF and enrollment into the study  [see 
Table 1Schedule of Assessments] . PGx samples will be stored for potential future analy sis. 
Any PGx sample taken during screening will be destroy ed in the event of a screen failure.
5.4 Safety Assessment
Safety  will be assessed by  examinin g the incidence of AE s, phy sical examinations findings, 
the clinician -administered C-SSRS, TVU’s, endometrial biopsies, vital signs, E CGs, clinical 
laboratory  tests and bone marker concentrations over time.
5.4.1 Vital Signs
Vital sign parameters will be assessed at each study  visit [see Table 1Schedule of 
Assessments].
The vital sign parameters that will be assessed are body  temperature (oral /tympanic ),blood 
pressure and pulse rate (sitting). 
Any change from baseline in vital sign values occurring durin g the study  that is considered to 
be clinically  relevant or that requires concomitant medication ,as judged b y the investigator ,
should be recorded in the source documents and the AEsection of the eCRF.
5.4.2 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C -SSRS is an assessment tool that evaluates suicidal ideation and behavior. A clinician 
will administer this measure electronicall y at the clinic visit. Administration should take 
place prior to an y invasive procedures. 
The C -SSRS will be administered at screening (visit 1), day  1 (visit 2), week 12 (visit 5), 
week 24 (visit 8), week 52 (visit 15)/EOT and the follow -up visit (week 55 [visit 16]) [see

with the regularl y scheduled routine screening mammogram of the patient, in accordance 
with local medical practice guidelines and the patient’s primary  care ph ysician.
5.4.6.2 Transvaginal Ultrasound
All other subjects willundergo a TVU to assess endometrial thickness at screening ,at 
week 52 (EOT )and for subjects who withdraw from the study at the ED visit. The 
endometrium should be measured in the long axis or sagittal plane . The measurement is of 
the thickest echogenic area from 1 basal endometrial interface across the endometria l canal to 
the other basal surface. Care should be taken not to include the hy poechoic my ometrium in 
this measurement. All TVUs will be read b y a local reader followed b y a central reading.
5.4.7 Endometrial Biopsy 
Subjects will undergo a suction endometrial biopsy at the fo llowing time points :
●Screening 
●At week 52/EOT/ED
●All cases of uterine bleeding during treatment
The endometrial biops y performed at screening must be evaluable. 
Subjects that require a retest biopsy for insufficient material or unevaluable results only ,will 
have an extended screening period and will be allowed an addit ional 15 day s of screening
(i.e., day s -50 to -1).A maximum of 1 retest biopsy  per screening is allowed.
Screening biop sy results are v alid for study  entry  for up to 3 months from date of procedure 
for applicable subjects.
During the treatment period, any  woman with an abnormal endometrial biopsy  reported as 
disordered proliferative endometrium, endometrial hy perplasia or endometrial cancer will be

5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definiti on of Adverse Events 
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug, and which 
does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE can 
therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
In order to identify  any events that may  be associated with study  procedures and could lead to 
a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received study  drug treatment. AE collection begins after the signing of the ICFand will be 
collected until 21 days after the last dose of stud y drug or the subject is determined to be a 
screen failure . 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.
5.5.1.1 Abnormal Laboratory Findings
Any abnormal laboratory test result (e.g. ,hematology , clinical chemistry  or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessmen t (e.g., ECGs, radio graphic scans, vital signs measurements, phy sical 
examination), including those that worsen from baseline, that is considered to be clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator and not related to 
underly ing disease, is to be reported as an (S)AE (adverse event or serious adverse event) .
Any clinica lly significant abnormal laboratory  finding or other abnormal safet y assessment 
which is associated with the underl ying disease does not require reporting as an (S)AE, 
unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s cond ition.
Repeating an abnormal laboratory  test or other safety  assessment, in the absence of any  of the 
above criteria, does not constitute an AE . Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an 
error does not require reporting as an AE.
5.5.1.2 Potential Ca sesof Drug -induced Liver Injury
Refer to [Appendix 12.4 Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment] for detailed instructions 
on DILI . Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent or with abnormal elevations in 
TBL that meet the criteria outlined in [Appendix 12.4 Liver Safet y Monitoring and 
Assessment], in the absence of other ca uses of liver injury , are considered pot ential cases of 
DILI (potential Hy ’s Law cases) . Any subject discontinuations due to liver safet yare alway s

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2to be considered important medical events and reported per [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events].
5.5.1.3 Disease Progression and Study Endpoints
Under this protocol, the following event(s) will not be considered as an (S)AE:
●Pre-planned and elective hospitalizations or procedu res for diagnostic, therapeutic or 
surgical procedures for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen during the course of 
the clinical study . These procedures are collected per the eCRFs Completion Guidelines.
5.5.2 Definition of Se rious Adverse Events
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life -threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either t he 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substant ial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions 
●Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect
●Requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures as allowed per study ) or 
leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned hospitalization 
is not caused b y an AE). Hospitalization for treatment/observation/examination caused b y 
AE is to be considered as serious.)
●Discontinuation due to increases in liver enz ymes (Section 6.1)
●Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below)
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, su ch as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, in cluding those that may  result in disability /incapacity , usuall y are 
considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospita lization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
5.5.2.1 Always Serious Adverse Events
The sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events . If an AE is 
reported that is considered by  the sponsor to be an SAE per this classific ation as “alway s 
serious”, additional information on the event (e.g. ,investigator confirmation of seriousness, 
causality ) will be requested .

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 25.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to Study Drug
A medicall y qualified investigator is obligated to assess the rela tionship between thestudy  
drug and each occurrence of each (S)AE. This medically  qualified investigator will use 
medical judgment ,as well as the Re ference Safet y Information [see S ection 1.4Summary  of 
Key Safety Information for Study  Drugs] to determine the relationship. The causalit y 
assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.
The med ically qualified investigator is requested to provide an explanation for the causality 
assessment for each (S)AE and must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the (S)AE and has provided an assessment of causality .
Following a review of th e relevant data, the causal relationship between the study  drug and 
each (S)AE will be assessed by  answering ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’ to the question “ Do you consider 
that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study 
drug ”.
When making an assessment of causalit y, the following factors are to be considered when 
deciding if there is evidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a ‘reasonable possibility ’ 
that an (S)AE may  have been caused by  the study drug (rather than a relationshi p cannot be 
ruled out) or if there is evidence to reasonabl y deny a causal relationship:
●Plausible temporal relationship between exposure to the study  drug and (S)AE onset 
and/or resolution. Has the subject actually  received the study  drug? Did the (S)AE o ccur 
in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the study  drug? 
●Plausibility ; i.e., could the event been caused by  the study  drug? Consider biologic and/or 
pharmacologic mechanism, half -life, literature evidence, drug class, preclinica l and 
clinical study  data, etc.
●Dechallenge/Dose reduction/Rechallenge: 
oDid the (S)AE resolve or improve after stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect 
drug? Also consider the impact of treatment for the event when evaluating a 
dechallenge experience.
oDid the (S)AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been 
stopped?
●Laboratory  or other test results; a specific lab investigation supports the assessment of the 
relationship between the (S)AE and the stud y drug (e.g., based on value s pre -, during and 
post-treatment)
●Available alternative explanations independent of study  drug exposure; such as other 
concomitant drugs, past medical history , concurrent or underl ying disease, risk factors 
including medical and family  history , season, lo cation, etc. and strength of the alternative 
explanation
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that 
the medically  qualified investigator alway s make an assessment of causalit y for every  event 
before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor. With limited or insufficient

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2information about the event to make an informed medical judgment and in absence of an y 
indication or evidence to establish a causal relationship, a causalit y assessment of ‘no’ is to 
be considered. In such instance, the investigator is expected to obtain additional information 
regarding the event as soon as possible and to re -evaluate the causality  upon receipt of 
additional information. The medica lly qualified investigator may  revise his/her assessment of 
causality  in light of new information regarding the SAE and shall send an SAE follow -up 
report and update the eCRF with the new information and updated causality assessment. 
5.5.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each AE:
●Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
●Moderate: Affect normal dail y activities
●Severe: Inability  to perform dail y activities
5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
The collection of AEs and the expedited reporting of SAEs will start following rece ipt of the 
ICFand will continue until 21 day s after the last administration of study  drug or the subject is 
determined to be a screen fai lure. 
In the case of a SAE, the investigator must contact the sponsor by fax or email immediately  
(within 24 hours of awareness).
The investigator must complete and submit an SAE worksheet containing all information that 
is required b y local and/or region al regulations to the sponsor by email or fax immediately  
(within 24 hours of awareness) . 
The SAE worksheet must be signed b y a medically  qualified investigator (as identified on 
Delegation of Authorit y Log). Signature confirms accuracy  and completeness o f the SAE 
data,as well as the investigator causalit y assessment including the explanation for the 
causality  assessment.
If the SAE is associated with emergency  unblinding as outlined in [Section 4.4.4 Breaking 
the Treatment Code in Emergency ]this is to be recorded on the SAE workshe et. Within the 
SAE worksheet, the investigator is to include when unblinding took place in association with 
the SAE.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2If there are an y questions, or if clarification is needed regarding the SAE, please contact the 
sponsor's medical monitor/ study physician or his/her designee [Section IIContact Details of 
Key Sponsor’s Personnel]. 
Follow -up information for the event should be sent promptly  (within 7 day s of the initial 
notification ).
Full details of the SAE should be recorded on the medical records, SAE/Special Situat ion 
Worksheet and on the eCRF.
The following minimum information is required:
●International Study  Number (ISN)/Study  number, 
●Subject number, sex and age,
●The date of report,
●A description of the SAE (event, seriousness criteria), 
●Causal relationship to the study  drug (including reason), and
●The drug provided (if any)
The sponsor or sponsor’s designee will medicall y evaluate the SAE and determine if the 
report meets the requirements for expedited reporting based on seriousness, causality and 
expectedness of the ev ents (e.g., SUSAR reporting) according to current local/regional 
regulatory  requirements in participating countries. The sponsor or spons or's designee will 
submit expedited safety  reports [e.g., IND Safety  Reports, SUSAR, Council for International 
Organizations of Medical Sciences -I(CIOMS -I)form] to Competent Authorities (CA s) and 
concerned Ethics Committee (cEC) per current local regulat ions, and will inform the 
investigators of such regulatory  reports as required. I nvestigators must submit safety  reports 
as required b y their IRB/local IEC within timelines set by  regional regulations (e.g., EMA, 
FDA) where required. Documentation of the s ubmission to and receipt by the I RB/local IEC 
of expedited safet y reports should be retained b y the site.
The sponsor will notify  all investigators responsible for ongoing clinical studies with the 
study  drug of all SUSARs, which require submission per loc al requirements to IRB/local 
IEC.
The investigators should provide written documentation of I RB/IEC notification for each 
report to the sponsor.
The investigator may  contact the sponsor's medical monitor/ study physician for an y other 
problem related to the safety , welfare or rights of the subject.
5.5.6 Follow -up of Adverse Events
All AEs occurring during or after the subject has discontinued the study  are to be followed up 
until resolved or judged to be no longer clinicall y significant, or until they  become chro nic to 
the extent that they  can be fully  characterized by  the investigator.

5.5.8 Special Situations 
Certain Special Situations observed in association with the study  drug(s), such as incorrect 
administration (e.g., wrong dose of study  drug, comp arator or bac kground therap y) are 
collected as protocol d eviation sper [Section 8.3Major Protocol Deviations] or may  require 
special reporting, as described in the subsections below. 
Special Situations are not considered AEs, but do require to be communicated to Astellas as 
per the timelines defined below.
If a Special Situation is associated with, or results in, an AE, the AE is to be assessed 
separately  from the Special Sit uation and captured as an AE in the eCRF . Ifthe AE meets the 
definition of a SAE, the SAE is to be reported as described in [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events] and the details of the associated Special Situation are to be included 
in the clinical description on the SAE worksheet .
Special Situations relevant to this protocol are:
●Pregnancy  
●Medi cation error, overdose and “off -label use”
●Misu se/abuse
●Suspected drug -drug interaction
5.5.8.1 Pregnancy
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study  dosing period or within 28 days from

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2The expected date of delivery  or expected date of the end of the pregnancy , last menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this 
information.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any  pregnancy  complication or 
termination (including elective termination) of a pregnancy  is to be reported for a female 
study  subject as an AE in the eCRF or SAE per [Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events]. 
Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  when also categorized as an 
SAE is mentioned below:
●"Spontaneous a bortion "includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion.
●Death of a newborn or infant within 1 month after birth is to be reported as an SAE 
regardless of its relationship with the study  drug.
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, is to be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as "possible "by 
the investigator.
●Congenital anomal y (including anomal y in miscarried fetus) .
Unless a congenital anomaly  is identified prior to spontane ous abortion or miscarriage, the 
embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by  visual examination. (S)AEs 
experienced b y the newborn/infant should be reported via the Pregnancy Reporting Form. 
Generally , follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery  
date.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 26.3 Discontinuation of the Study
The sponsor may  terminate this study  prematurel y,or treatment arm, either in its entirety  or 
at an y study site, for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of 
the intended termination . Advance notice is not required if the study  is stopped due to safety  
concerns. If the sponsor terminates the stud yfor safet y reasons, the sponsor will immediately  
notify  the investigator and subsequently  provide written instructions for study  termination .  
7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
As described above, the first 12 weeks of treatment will be double -blind, with a 12-week
analysis conducted after all subjects complete 12 weeks of treatment. After completing 
12weeks of treatment, subjects will receive active treatment through end of 52-week study .
Given the design, a 12 -week treatment analysis will occur to assess efficac y and safet y during 
the double -blind treatment phase. This will occur after all subjects have completed 12 weeks 
of treatment. Efficacy  and safet y data will be analyzed, excluding the endpoints measured 
after 12 weeks. Since all primary  and secondary  analy ses only  based on data through week 12, 
no alpha adjustment is required as the information fraction at the 12 -week analy sis is 100%. 
Data from the extension treatment period will be summarized without statistical comparison 
to placebo.
A statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analy sis, along with 
specifications for tables, listings and figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized before 
the hard lock for the12 -week treatment anal ysisat the latest . Changes from the a nalyses 
planned in SAP that affect the statistical anal yses will be documented inthe clinical study  
report .
In general, continuous data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, 
mean, SD, minimum, median and maximum) and frequency  and percentage for categorical 
data.
7.1 Sample Size
A total of 450subjec ts are planned to be randomized; 150 subjects in each treatment arm.
The p hase 2b dose -ranging stud y included 7 active doses. In this study, the observed 
least-squares mean dif ference between fezolinetant and plac ebo in change from baseline to 
week 12 (and w eek 4) in mean dail y freque ncy of moderate to severe VMS ranged from 
-1.8 to -3.0.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2For a pairwise comparison using a 2 -sample t -test at a 2 -sided 2.5% alpha (adjusting for 
2active doses) , 120subjects would provide 79% or more power to detect the following effect 
sizes assuming a SD of 5:
Assu med treatment difference in mean daily frequency Power for pairwise test
-2.0 79%
-2.3 90%
-2.5 94%
For change from baseline to w eek 12 (and w eek 4) in mean severit y of moder ate to severe 
VMS , the observed mea n treatment differences in the p hase 2b stud y ranged from 
-0.2 an d -1.0. 
For a pairwise comparison using a 2 -sample t -test at a 2 -sided 2.5% alpha (adjusting for 
2active dos es), 120subjects would provide the at least 79% power to detect the following 
effect sizes assuming a SD of 1:
Assu med treatment difference in mean severity Power for pairwise test
-0.40 79%
-0.46 90%
-0.50 94%
NOTE: T he combined power for testing all 4 co-primary  endpoints will be lower than the 
power for each considered individually ; however, the co -primary  endpoints are correlated 
(especially  the same endpoint at different time points) and this will serve to limit the potential 
reduction of power . 
Assuming approximately 20% of subjects discontinue prematurel y, the number of subjects 
will be increased from 120to 150 subjects per arm.
Thissample siz e would also provide over 95 % power to detect a difference of 4.3 from 
placebo on the key  secondary  endpoin tof the PROMI S sleep disturbance questionnaire, using 
a 2-sample t -test ata 2-sided 2.5% alpha (adjusting for 2 active doses) assuming a SD of 
7[Avis et al , 2016].
7.2 Analysis Sets
Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be laid out in classificati on specifications and the 
allocation of subjects to analy sis sets will be determined prior to database hard -lock. 
For each treatment group, the number and percentage of subjects will be characterized for all 
randomized subjects and by  each anal ysis set.
7.2.1 Full Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set (FAS) will consist of all subjects who are ran domized and receive at 
least 1 dose of stud y drug. This will be the primary anal ysis set for efficacy anal yses. The 
randomized treatment for each subject will be used for summaries b y treatment group based 
on the FAS, even if a subject erroneously  received a different treatment.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 27.2.2 Per Protocol Set
The per protocol set (PPS) will consist of the subset of the FAS who do not meet criteria for 
PPS exclusion. These criteria are t o capture relevant non -adherence to the protocol , in a 
manner that might reasonably  impact the primary  anal ysis,and will be defined in the SAP. A 
full list of criteria will be decided and assessed prior to database lock and unblinding . There 
are 2 PPS pop ulations; one specific to the co -primary  anal yses at week 4 and another specific 
to week 12. Final judgments on exclusion of subjects from Per Protocol Set -Week 4 (PPS4) 
and Per Protocol Anal ysis Set -Week 12 (PPS12) will be made prior to randomization 
unblinding. 
7.2.3 Safety Analysis Set
The safet y analysis set ( SAF)consists of all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose of 
study  drug, and will be used for safet y anal yses. A subject erroneousl y receiving a treatment 
different from their randomized tre atment will be assigned to the treatment group that the 
patient received as first dose.
7.2.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis S et
The pharmacokinetic analy sis set (PKAS) consists of the administered population for which 
sufficient plasma concentration data is available to facilitate deriva tion of at least 
1pharmacokinetic parameter and for whom the time of dosing on the day  of sampling is 
known. Additional subjects may  be excluded from the PKAS at the discretion of the 
pharmacokineticist. An y formal definitions for exc lusion of subjects or time -points from the 
PKAS will be documented in the in the Classification Specifications and determined the 
Classification Meeting. The PKAS will be used for all summaries and analy ses of the 
pharmacokinetic data.
7.3 Demographics and Bas eline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by  treatment group ,as well as 
for all treatment groups combined . 
7.3.1 Subject Disposition 
The number and percentage of subjects who completed and discontinued treatment and 
reasons for treatment discontinuation will be presented for all randomized subjects and for 
subjects in the SAF b y treatment group and overall. Similar tables for screening disposition
andinvestigational period disposition will also be presented for all r andomized subjects by  
treatment group and overall. All disposition details and dates of first and last evaluations for 
each subject will be listed.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 27.4 Analysis of Efficacy 
Efficacy  anal ysis will be conducted on the FAS and PPS. The interpretation of results from 
statistical tests will be based on the FAS. The PPS will b e used to assess the robustness of the 
results from the statistical tests based on the FAS.
All statistical comparisons will be conducted using 2-sided tests at the α =0.05 significance 
level unless specifically  stated otherwise. There are additional test ing details below regarding 
the 4 co -primary  endpoints. All null hy potheses will be of no treatment difference, all 
alternative h ypotheses will be 2-sided and control for 2 comparisons to placebo using the 
Hochberg approach , unless specificall y stated othe rwise.
7.4.1 Analysis of Co-primary Endpoint 
7.4.1.1 Co-primary Analysis
The 4 co -primary  efficacy  endpoints are the mean change in the frequency  of moderate to 
severe VMS and the mean change in seve rity of VMS (per 24 hours) from baseline to week 4 
and w eek 12.
For e ach of the 4 co -primary  efficacy  endpoints, a mixed models repeated measures anal ysis 
of covariance (MMRM) will be used with treatment group , week and smoking status (current
vs former/never) as factors , with baseline weight and baseline measurement as covariates, as 
well as an interaction of treatment b y week and an interaction of baseline measurement by  
week . An unstructured covariance structure shared across treatment groups will be used to 
model the within -patient errors. The Kenward -Roger approximat ion will be used to estimate 
denominator degrees of freedom and adjust standard errors. This anal ysis will use a restricted
maximum likelihood –based repeated -measures approach. The treatment difference will be 
estimated at all study  weeks. MMRM will use al l available on -treatment data to inform mean 
treatment effect estimates without requiring explicit imputation for missing data (i.e., for 
discontinued subjects). This approach is consistent with the hy pothetical strategy  used for the 
estimand, which is to compare patients as though they  had continued on the assigned 
treatment.
Comparisons between the fezolinetant and placebo will be calculated based on least -squares 
mean contrasts using a 2 -tailed 95% confidence interval (CI) .
The hy pothesis for each pairwise comparison is given as follows:
H0: The change from baseline at week 4 (or 12) for fezolinetant and placebo are the same
H1: The change from baseline at week 4 (or 12) for fezolinetant and placebo are not the same
The co-primary analy sis will use the FAS.
Frequency  of moderate or severe VMS events will be calculated as the sum of moderate or 
severe VMS events per day .

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2Severity  of post -baseline co -primary  severit y endpoints will be calculated using a weighted 
average defined as sh own below. Note that the calculation for severity  at baseline uses a 
similar formula, but does not include mild VMS events in the numerator or denominator.
([number of mild hot flashes/day  × 1] + [number of moderate hot flashes/day  × 2] + 
[number of severe hot flashes/day  × 3])/total number of dail y (or weekl y) 
mild/moderate/severe hot flashes
Daily  frequency  and severity  per week (e.g., week 4, week 12) will be calculated as the 
average frequency  or severity  over 7 day s. The specific windows will be define d in the SAP.
The famil y-wise t ype I error rate for the 2 active dose groups compared to placebo for the 
4co-primary  efficacy  endpoints will be controlled using a Hochberg approach. All 
4co-primary  endpoints must be statistically  significant for a given dose to be considered 
successful. Given that, the largest p -value from the 4 co -primary  endpoints in each dose 
group will be used to test that dose because it represents the least significant of the 
co-primary  endpoints. If the larger of the 2 maximum P va lues, one from each dose, is less 
than 0.05, then both dose groups are considered statistically  significant. If not, then if the 
smaller of the P values is less than 0.025, the second compared dose is considered statistically  
significant. Otherwise, neithe r dose is considered statistically  significant. The trial will be 
considered successful if at least one dose is statistically  significant. 
7.4.1.2 Sensitivity Analysis of Co -primary Endpoints
Sensitivity analy ses will be carried out for the co -primary  efficacy  endpoints based on the 
PPS populations. The data will be anal yzed using the same MMRM model as the primary  
analyses, but the comparison of interest is a particular week within each population (week 4 
when using PPS4, and week 12 when using PPS12).
The anal ysis for each of the co -primary  endpoints also will be conducted using a simplified 
MMRM model with treatment group and week as factors, with baseline measurement as a 
covariate, as well as an interaction of treatment by week and baseline b y week.
7.4.1.3 Subgroup Analysis
The simplified MMRM for the co -primary efficacy  endpoints analy seswill be repeated ,
including but not limited to, smoking status , body  mass index and race.
7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
The anal ysis of secondary  efficacy  endpoints will be based on the FAS. For efficacy  
endpoints collected at visits, the last non -missing assessment prior to the first dose of study  
treatment (investigational product or placebo) is the baseline.
7.4.2.1 Key Secondary Endpoint
The PROMI S SD SF 8b scale will be analy zedusing MMRM, similar to the primary  anal ysis 
of the co -primary  endpoints.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2If all the co -primary  endpoints are statistically  significant between fezolinetant and placebo at 
both doses, then the 5% alpha from the analy sis of the co -primary  endpoints will be passed to 
the key  secondary  endpoint as part of the family -wise error rate.
7.4.2.2 Secondary Endpoints
For percent reduction at weeks 4 and 12, an MMRM model as described in [Section 7.4.1.1
Co-Primary  Anal ysis] will be used. Additional calculations of severit y will be described in 
the SAP and will also be anal yzed as described in Section 7.4.1.1 Co-Primary  Anal ysis.
For each of the secondary responder endpoints, logistic regression will be used for the 
analysis for each week and endpoint. A missing value will be imputed as a nonresponder.
PGI-C will be anal yzed using Cochran Mantel Haenszel test.
7.4.3 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
Percent reduction, PROMI S (SD and SRI total scores), MENQOL total, EQ -5D domain 
scores and WPAI -VMS total score will be assessed using an MMRM model as described in 
[Section 7.4.1.1 Co-Primary  Anal ysis]. Percent reduction and absolute reduction will be 
analyzed as described for the secondary  responder endpoints. PGI -S will be an alyzed using 
Cochran Mantel Haenszel test adjusted for baseline score. The m edian change in serum 
concentrations of sex hormones and sex hormone -binding globulin (SHBG) from baseline to 
weeks 4 and 12 and the m ean change in serum concentrations of BSAP, P1 NP and CTX from 
baseline to week 12 will be summarized. 
NOTE: Assessments after the 12 -week placebo -controlled period are descriptive only , 
because there is no placebo control.
7.5 Analysis of Safety
Safety  will be assessed by  examinin g the incidence of AE s, physical examinations findings, 
the clinician -administered C-SSRS, TVU’s, endometrial biopsies, vital signs, ECGs , clinical 
laboratory  tests and bone marker concentrations over time.
7.5.1 Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded using MedDRA. 
TEAE is defined as an AEobserved after starting administration of the study  drug and 
21days after the last dose of study  drug.
The number and percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to 
withdrawal of treatment and AEs related to study  drug will be s ummarized by  system organ 
class, preferred term and treatment group. The number and percentage of AEs by severit y 
will also be summarized. 
A study  drug -related TEAE is defined as any  TEAE with a causal relationship of YES by  the 
investigator.

8 OPERATIONAL CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Data Collection
The investigator or site design ee will enter data collected using a n electronic data capture 
system. In the interest of collecting data in the most efficient manner, the investigator or site 
designee should record data (including laboratory  values, if applicable) in the eCRF within 
5days after the subject’s visit.
The investigator or site designee is responsible to ensure that all data in the eCRFs and 
queries are accurate and complete and that all entries are verifiable with source documents. 
These documents should be appropriatel y mai ntained by  the site.
The monitor should verify  the data in the eCRFs with source documents and confirm that 
there are no inconsistencies between them.
Laboratory  tests are performed at central laboratory . Central Laboratory  data will be 
transferred electro nically to the sponsor or designee at predefined intervals during the study . 
The central laboratory  will provide the sponsor or designee with a complete and clean copy  
of the data.

transferred electronically to the sponsor or designee at predefined intervals during the stud y. 
The central ECG laboratory  will provide the sponsor or designee with a complete and clean 
copy  of the data.
All procedures conducted under the protocol must be documented. For screen failures, the 
minimum demographic data (sex, birth date /age, race and ICF date), outcome of eligibility  
assessment (inclusion and exclusion criteria), reason for screen failure and AEs details must 
be documented.
Theinvestigator or designee will be responsible for source data completion and that all data 
and queries are accurate, complete and are verifiable with the source. The source should be 
appropriatel y maintained by the clinical unit.
Electronic data sources an d any  supporting documents should be available for 
review/retrieval b y the sponsor/designee at an y given time.
8.1.1 Electronic Cl inical Outcome Assessment /Electr onic Patient -reported Outcome
Subject diaries and questionnaires as described in [Section 5.3.3 Patient -reported Outcomes 
Assessments] will be completed by  the subject on an electronic device and the collected 
electronic source data will be hosted at the vendor. The investigator or site designee will 
review the diaries and questionnaire data throughout the study  to ensure completion and 
protocol compliance.
The diary  and questionnaire data will be transferred electronically  to sponsor or designee at 
predefined in tervals during the stud y. The vendor will provide the investigator with a 
complete and clean cop y of their site’s data and will provide the sponsor or designee with a 
complete and clean cop y of the study  data . The ownership of this data is with the investi gator 
and subsequentl y any changes requested to these subject reported data will be made using a 
Data Clarification Form (DCF) to the vendor. The requested change must be supported by  
documented evidence at site. Forthis study , it has been decided that th ere are justifiable 
scientific reasons (e.g., recall bias) for not allowing the following variables or ty pe of data to 
be added to or changed greater than one calendar day  after the original daily  diary  data has 
been entered and submitted, as a change coul d potentially  impact the data integrit y of this 
study : HFdiary  entries and associated severities. Subjects’ diaries will be set up with a 
24hour window for daily entry . If there are no entries during the 24 -hour window, upon their 
next interaction with t he diary , subjects will be asked to confirm no hot flash entries for the 
previous day  or to record the missed entries that occurred up to 24 hours ago. Within one 
calendar day  of the dail y diary  entry  missed or entry  requiring changes, subjects may  request
the site to initiate changes or additions to that entry  through the vendor’s DCF process. The 
requested change to the HF diary  or associated severities must be supported by  documented 
evidence at site.
The daily  diary  compliance threshold for each individ ual subject should not fall below 85%. 
In cases where a subject’s compliance falls below this threshold, the site should immediately  
retrain the subject and document this training in the subject’s source.

8.3 Major Protocol Deviations
A protocol deviation is generall y an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not 
implemented or intended as a s ystematic change. All deviations from the protocol are to be 
recorded. A protocol waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an 
investigator to deviate from the protocol. Protocol waivers are strictl y prohibited. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study  is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol and must protect the rights, safety and 
well-being of subjects. The investigator should not implement any  deviation from, or changes 
of, the pr otocol, unless it is necessary  to eliminate an immediate hazard to subjects . 
A major protocol deviation is one that may  potentially  impact the completeness, accuracy  or 
reliability  of data contributing to the primary  endpoint or affect the rights, safet y or 
well-being of a subject. Major protocol deviations will have additional reporting 
requirements. 
When a major deviation from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the 
investigator or designee must ensure the sponsor is notified. The spon sor will follow up with 
the investigator, as applicable, to assess the deviation and the possible impact to the safet y 
and/or efficacy  or pharmacokinetic parameters of the subject to determine subject 
continuation in the study .
The major protocol deviation criteria that will be summarized at the end of the study  are as 
follows:
PD1 -Entered into the study  even though the subject did not satisfy  entry  criteria 
PD2 -Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and was not with drawn
PD3 -Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose
PD4 -Received excluded concomitant treatment
The investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and appropriate regulatory  
authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropriatel y. All documentation and 
communications to the IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory  authorities will be provided to the 
sponsor and maintained within the trial master file.

related records such as source documents. The sponsor is responsible for assigning study  
monitor(s) to this study  for proper monitoring. They  will monitor the study in accordance 
with planned monitoring procedures . 
12.2.2 Direct Access to Source Data/Documents
The investigator and the study  site must accept monitoring and auditing b y the sponsor or 
delegated CRO ,as well as inspections from the I RB/IEC and relevant regulatory  authorities. 
In these instances, they  must provide all study -related rec ords including source documents 
when they  are requested by  the sponsor mon itors and auditors, the IRB/ IECor regulatory  
authorities. The confidentiality  of the subject's identities shall be well protected consistent 
with local and national regulations when the source documents are subject to direct access.
12.2.3 Data Management
Data m anagem ent will be coordinated b y Data Science or designee of the sponsor in 
accordance with the SOPs for data management. All study -specific processes and definitions 
will be documen ted b y Data Management. eCRF completion will be described in the eCRF 
instructions. Coding of medical terms and medications will be performed using MedDRA 
andWHO Drug Dictionary , respectively .
12.2.4 Quality Assurance
The sponsor is implementing and maintaining quality  assurance (QA) and quality  control 
(QC) sy stems with written SOPs to ensure that studies are conducted and data are generated, 
documented, recorded and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP and applicable 
regulatory  requirement(s). Where ap plicable, the QA and QC s ystems and written SOPs of 
the CRO will be applied.
The sponsor or sponsor’s designee may  arrange to audit the study  at an y or all study  sites and 
facilities. The audit may  include on -site review of regulatory  documents, CRFs and s ource 
documents. Direct access to these documents will be required by  the auditors.
To support quality  around subject safet y and reliability  of study  results, quality  tolerance 
limits (QTL s) are defined and monitored. QTLs represent the acceptable variatio n of study  
data, taking into consideration the current state of medical and statistical knowledge about the 
variables to be anal yzed as well as the statistical design of the study . It is a level, point, or 
value associated with a parameter that should trig ger an evaluation if a deviation is detected 
to determine if there is a possible sy stematic issue (i.e., a trend has occurred). The QTLs 
defined for this stud y, information regarding the QTL  limit and limit justification, as well as 
associated activities a re documented in STL -3458 QTL  monitoring plan.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 212.4 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment 
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study  with active drug therapy  and reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × ULN or bilirubin > 2 × ULN should undergo detailed 
testing for liver enzy mes (including at least ALT, AST, AL P and TBL). Testing should be 
repeated within 72 hours of notification of the test results. For studies for which a central 
laboratory  is used, alerts will be generated by  the central laboratory  regarding moderate and 
severe liver abnormality  to inform the investigator and study  team. Subjects should be asked 
if they  have an y symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST TBL
Moderate > 3 ×ULN or > 2 ×ULN
Severe > 3 ×ULN and > 2 ×ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic test abnormalities for an y 
of the following:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST > 3 ULN AND TBL > 2 ULN or INR >1.5, or
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN w ith the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia ( >5% increase above 
baseline)
The investigator may  determine that abnormal liver testresults, other than as described above, 
may qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring and 
follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic tests should be thoroughl y 
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , 
physical examination and laboratory  tests. The site staff is to complete the liver abnormality  
case report form (LA -CRF). Subjects with confirmed liver aminotransferases (ALT or AST)
elevations should be followed as described below .
Moderate liver test abnormalities as defined above should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly , 
andthen weekly  or less if abnormalities stabilize or the study  drug has been discontinued and 
the subject is asy mptomatic . 
Severe liver test abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another etiology , are
considered an important medical event and should be reported as a SAE . The sponsor should 
be contacted and informed immediately  of all subjects for whom severe hepatic liver function 
abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are observed.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 2To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases . Symptoms 
and new -onset diseases is to b e recorded as “AEs” within the eCRF . Illnesses and 
conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated cardiac disease that may  lead 
to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in 
obese h yperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic patients, and may be associated with 
fluctuating AT levels . The investigator should ensure that the medical history  form 
captures an y illness that predates stud y enrollment that may  be relevant in assessing 
hepatic function. 
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and 
special diets . Medicati ons, is to be entered in the e CRF. Information on alcohol, other 
substance use and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
●Based on the subject’s history ,other testing may  beappropriate including: 
○Acute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents), 
○Ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease,
○Other laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin.
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consult ations .
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.
Study Treatment Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased liver aminotransferase (ALT or AST) tests ,
such as viral hepatitis, pre existing or acute liver disease or exposure to other agents 
associated with liver injury , the subject may  be discontinued from study  treatment. The 
investigator may  determine that it is not in the subject’s best interest to con tinue study  
treatment. Study treatment must be discontinued and event be reported as an SAE if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia ( >5%increase above 
baseline )
Subjects who develop a signal of liver injury  will be monitored every  2 to 4 weeks if the 
study  drug is discontinued. If the subject rem ains on study  drug, they  will be closel y 
monitored for liver biochemistry  result s. Subjects with a signal of elevated transaminases 
(>3 × ULN) will have a pre -dose PK sample drawn in addition to repeat blood draws for 
liver biochemistry  monitor ing. These samples can be held for potential analy sis based on the 
subject’s clinical outcome.

*Hy’s Law Definition: Drug -induced jaundice caused by  hepatocellular injury , without a 
significant obstructive component, has a high rate of bad outcomes, from 10 to 50% mortality  
(or transplant). 
The 2 “requirements” for Hy ’s Law are: 
1.Evidence that a drug can cause hepatocellular -type injury , generall y shown by an increase 
in transaminase elevations higher 3 × ULN (“2 × ULN elevations are too common in 
treated and untreated patients to be discriminating”). 
2.Cases of increased bilirubin (at least 2 × ULN) with concurrent transaminase elevations at 
least 3 × ULN and no evidence of intra -or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated 
ALP) or Gilbert’s s yndrome [Temple, 2006].

1.The drug causes hepatocellular injury , generally  shown by  a higher incidence of 3 -fold or 
greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (nonhepatotoxic) control drug 
or placebo.
2.Among stud y subjects showing such AT elevations, often wit h ATs much greater than 
3×ULN, 1 or more also show elevation of serum TBL to > 2×ULN, without initial 
findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP).
3.No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and TBL, such 
as viral hepatitis A, B or C; preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of 
causing the observed injury .

INTRODUCTION
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturall y occurring differences in a 
subject’s gene and/or expression of genes based on genetic variation may  impact what 
treatment options are be st suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx by  
technologies such as genoty ping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide 
Association Studies , the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy  or 
toxicity  may  bebetter understood. As many  diseases may  be influenced by  1 or more genetic 
variations, PGx research may  identify  which genes are involved in determining the way  a 
subject may  or may  not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may  be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory . The objective of this research will be to analy zeor determine genes of relevance 
to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and/or toxicity /safet y issues.
By anal yzing genetic variations, it may  be pos sible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
SUBJECT PARTICIPATIO N
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study  participate in this PGx sub -study . 
Subjects must provide written consent prior to providing an y blood samples that may be used 
at a later time for PGx analy sis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study  will provide 1 tube of whole blood of 
approximately  4 to 6 mL  per Astellas’ instruct ions. Each sample will be identifie d by the 
unique subject number .Samples will be shipped to a designated banking CRO as directed by  
Astellas.
PGxANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analy sis cannot be established y et. Astellas may  initiate the PGx 
analysis if evidence suggests that genetic variants may  be influencing the drug’s kinetics, 
efficacy  and/or safety. 
DISPOSAL OF PGx SAMPLES/ DATA
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following stud y 
database hardlock. If ther e is no requirement for analy sis, the whole blood sample will be 
destroy ed after the planned storage period. The subject has the right to withdraw consent at 
any time. When a subject’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroy ed. Th e results of any  PGx anal ysis conducted on a sampl e prior to its withdrawal will 
be retained at Astellas indefinitely  unless otherwise specified by  local regulation .

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 213 ATTACHMENT 1:  SUBSTANTIAL AMEN DMENT 2
I.  The purpose of this amendment is:
Substantial Changes
1.Update Inclusion Criteria #4, #8, #9 and #10
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Inclusion criterion #4 is updated to remove with or without hysterectomy from the bilateral 
oophorectom y screening criteria. Inclusion criteria #8 and #10 are aligned to account for the 
exclusion of subjects who have had a h ysterectomy .Inclusion criterion #9 is updated to 
specify  that the endometrial biopsy  obtained at screen ing must be considered evaluable; this 
criterion is now required for all subjects. 
RATIONALE:
These inclusion criteria are being updated to ensure that only patients with a uterus and an 
evaluable screening endometrial biopsy  are to be enrolled in the study  moving forward.
2.Add COVID -19 Considerations
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Alternate measures that may  be implemented due to site closures related to the COVID -19 
pandemic are added to the protocol. These include telemedicine conferences (by  telephone), 
home healthcare services, and laboratory  assessments performed at local laboratories.
It is noted that subjects who screen fail due to a COVID -19 pandemic study  suspension and 
have an evaluable endometrial biopsy  will not require a repeat biops y if they rescreen.
RATIONALE:
These measures will provide an alternative for conducting the study  visits when scheduled 
visits cannot be conducted at the clinical si te due to the COVID -19 pandemic.
3.Update Exclusion Criteria #6 and #7, and Add Exclusion Criterion #20
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Exclusion criteria #6 and #7 are updated so that they  appl y to all subjects, not just subjects 
with a uterus, and the exception for endometrial thickness less than 4 mm is removed from 
exclusion criterion #7 . Exclusion criterion #20 is added to exclude subjects who have had 
partial or full h ysterectomies.
RATIONALE:
These exclusion criteria are updated to ensure that only patients with a uterus and an 
evaluable screening endometrial biopsy  are to be enrol led in the study  moving forward.

Version 3.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 24.Update Endometrial Biopsy Requirements
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Language is added to specify  that the screening endometrial biopsy  must be evaluable. Retest 
biopsies may  only be performed for insufficient material or unevalua ble biopsies, and a 
maximum of one retest biopsy  during screening is allowed. It is noted that subjects will be 
allowed into the study  based on the primary  endometrial result/diagnosis, but a second and 
tertiary  diagnosis will also be reported.
RATIONALE:
This change is made to clarify  that onl y patients with an evaluable screening endometrial 
biopsy  are to be enrolled in the study  moving forward.
5.Update Adverse Events of Special Interest
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Adverse events (AEs) of abuse liability , depression, wakefulness and effect on memory  are 
added to the protocol as AEs of special interest. AEs of liver test elevation are clarified. 
RATIONALE:
These AEs of special interest are added per the request of the European Medicines Agency . 
Liver test elevations criterion is removed from this section as they  are located in the 
laboratory  anal ysis section.
6.Update Subject Discontinuation Criteria
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Category  2 results of secondary  or te rtiary  screening endometrial biopsy  diagnosis are added 
to the list of reasons for subject discontinuation.
RATIONALE:
To clarify  asubject ’s need to be discontinued if the results of the second ary or tertiary 
reading of his/her screening endometrial biopsy  indicates Category  2 results.
7.Change Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C) in VMS to Secondary 
Endpoint
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
The exploratory  endpoint of “Mean score on the PGI -C in VMS from baseline to each visit”
is re-categorized as a secondary  endpoint. Sections 7.4.2.2 Secondary  Endpoints and 7.4.3 
Exploratory  Endpoints are updated to move the PGI -C anal ysis to Section 7.4.2.2.
RATIONALE:
This endpoint is moved to secondary  endpoints as it will be potential ly used for the anchor -
based method for ps ychometric anal ysis in evaluating clinicall y meaningful within -patient

made to split one sentence that includes both PGI -Cand Patient Global I mpressi on of 
Severity  (PGI -S) into two : one for PGI -C and one for PGI -S.
8.Add Daily Diary Compliance
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Language is added to instruct sites about daily  diary  compliance.
RATIONALE:
This language i s added to provide the compliance threshold to sites at which additional 
retraining and documentation of retraining is required for subjects that are not completing 
daily  diary  entries as required.
Nonsubstantial Changes

have to undergo a repeat biopsy should they decide to rescreen.
COVID -19 Consideration:
All attempts should be made to conduct the protocol -defined scheduled visits. In cases 
where a subject is unable to visit the clinic due to site closure related to the COVID -19 
pandemic, the following alternative measures may be implemented to ensure subject 
safety and continuity of care while participating in the study:
●Telemedicine Conferences (telephone visits) to evaluate changes in a subject’s 
medical condition or medications and completion of electronic patient -reported 
outcome questionnaires following the process defined in the COVID -19  
Notification of Pause and Scre ening Enrollment memo released on 27 March 2020 
provided to the site by the sponsor.
●Safety laboratory tests collected at a local lab including biochemistry, hematology, 
liver biochemistry and coagulation panel testing.
●Subjects should be instructed to continue entering their hot flashes in the daily 
handheld diary as instructed regardless of site closure.
●Home healthcare services may be available in cases where arrangements are made 
in advance by the site upon request from the subject(s).

diagnosis is Category 2.  All 3 pathology reports should be filed in the subject’s source 
document. Please reference the central laboratory manual for further details and timing 
of biopsy specimen results.
All biopsies will be read concurrently  by 3 independent expert pathologists from institutions 
with independent fiduciary  and organizational reporting.  Each pathologist should be blinded 
to the treatment group and to the readings of the other pathologists .  For EOT/ED biopsies 
and all biopsies in cases of uterine bleeding during treatment, Tthe concurrence of 2 of 
the 3 pathologists is accepted as the final diagnosis.  If there is no agreement among the 3 
pathologists, the most severe pathologic diagnosis should be used as the final diagnosis.

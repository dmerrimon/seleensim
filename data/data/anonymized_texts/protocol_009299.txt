Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information 1 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Title A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled Study of COR388 HCl in 
Subjects with Alzheimer’s Disease 
Objectives The objectives of the study are to:  
Assess the efficacy of 2 dose levels of COR388 HCl in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) subjects; and
Assess the safety and tolerability of 2 dose levels of COR388 HCl inAD subjects.
Study Phase Phase 2/3 
Study Design This is a randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled study that will 
assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 dose levels of 
COR388 HCl in subjects with probable AD dementia according to the 
National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria 
(McKhann 2011). The study will enroll approximately 573 generally healthy 
male and female subjects 55 and 80 years of age. Enrolled subjects 
must 
have a documented diagnosis of probable AD dementia with clinical 
evidence of progressive cognitive decline in the last year. Clinical decline 
will be defined as
 the evidence of progressive cogniti ve decline on 
sequential evaluations based  on information from informants and/or 
cognitive testing in the context of either formal neuropsychological 
evaluation or standardized mental status examin ations for probabl e AD 
dementia (McKhann 2011). The subject should not have other conditions 
or
 brain imaging abnormalities that can explain the symptoms  of dementia. 
All subjects will have lumbar punctures (LPs) performed at baseline 
(Visit
 2) and at end of treatment Week 48 (Visit 10) or early termination 
visit (ET). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be tested for measurement of 
bacterial DN
A (Pg) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), 
biomarkers of AD, and gingipain activity.  Saliva, and blood will be 
analyzed for
 biomarkers of AD and neur oinflammation, and for the 
presence of bacterial deoxyribonucle ic acid (DNA) of Porphyromonas 
gingivalis  (P. gingivalis [Pg]) using qPCR.  
A
 subset of sites will be selected to monitor subjects for clinical evidence 
of
 periodontitis in addition to AD. An oral examination will be conducted by 
a study dentist/hygienist at these sites to assess for the presence of 
clinical evidence of periodontiti s at screening, 24 and 48 weeks. 
Subgingival plaque (SGP) and buccal cell swabs will be collected at these 
sites 
and analyzed for measurements of biomarkers associated with 
P. gingivalis  DNA, proteins, and inflammation.
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 6 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information Due to the nature of AD, subjects  must identify a primar y caregiver prior to 
enroll
ment in the study wh o will assist the subject with study participation. 
The primary caregiver must sign a caregiver informed con sent.  
The safety of study participants will be evaluated throughout the study by 
repeated physical examinations, vital signs, safety lab o ratory tests,12-lead 
electrocardiograms (E CG s), Columbia-Suicide Seve rit y Ratin g Scal e 
(C-SSRS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and assessments of 
treatment-emergent advers e events (T E AEs). Periodic safety reviews will 
be conducted during the study.  
Following the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ) recommend ation after 
the November 16, 2020 meeting, increased frequency of liver safe ty 
monitoring has been implemented, which increased the frequency of 
safety laboratory analyte collections (see Table 1 and Table 2, Schedule 
of Evaluations).    
The stud y will consist of 3 periods: a screening peri od of up to 6 weeks, a 
treatment period of up to 48 weeks, and a safety follow-up pe riod of 
6 weeks. An interim analysis may be conducted to reassess the sample 
size and e
valuate for efficacy after 24 weeks of treatment on ke y outcome 
measures. 
Screening 
During the screening period, the eligib ility of subjects will be confirmed 
according to the Sche dule of Evaluations in this protocol. The Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) will be administered by a trained rater to 
assess the level of cognitive impairment. MMSE will be assessed as early 
in the screening period as possibl e. Subjects with MMSE score of 12-24, 
inclusive, will have the rest of thei r screening procedures performed or 
scheduled. Magnetic resonance im aging (MRI) of the brain will be 
performed in all subjects at screening, except subjects with an absolute 
contraindication for MRI, who can ha ve a Comp uted Tomograp hy (CT) 
scan of the brain instead. Screening procedures can be done on mu ltiple 
days if needed, with more invasive procedures d one after less invasive 
screening procedures a r e completed. A screen failure is an y subject who 
signs the info rmed consent but does not qualify for the study or 
discontinues the study prior to randomization. A subject can be rescreened 
if the Principal Investigator thinks the subject may qualify for the study 
upon rescreening, and if the Medical Monitor agrees.  
Treatment P
eriod 
Subjects who meet all eligibility crit eria will enter the treatment period and 
will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive 40 mg COR388 HCl, 80 mg COR388 
HCl, or pl
acebo twice a day. Randomization will be stratified by baseline 
MMSE (MMSE  12 and  18, and MMSE  19 and  24) and 
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4 positive either homozygou s or heterozygous vs. 
all others) g
enotype to assure balan ced distribution of mild and moderate 
AD and a bal
anced distribution of ApoE4 subjects, across treatment arms. 
Subjects  will receive their assigned b linded study treat ment orally twice a 
day for up to 48 weeks and will come back to the inv estigative site 
perio
dically for scheduled e fficacy and safety ev aluations. Blood samples 
for pha
rmacokinetics levels  and biomarkers will be collecte d  during 
selected visits. Baseline LP will be perfo rmed prior to the first dose of 
stud
y drug, and follow-up LP will be done at the end of the treatment 
period. Subjects will continue to re ceive the study dr ug for 48 weeks, 
unless the Investi gator determines that treatment of a given sub ject  shoul d 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 7 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information be stopped or interru pted for safety or tolerability reasons, the s ubject 
withdraws
 consent, or the Sponsor decides to stop the study.  
Safety Follow-up Period 
After completion of stud y treatment, subj ects will continue to be monitored 
on the study for 6 weeks and will have a phone call to assess safety at 
Weeks 49 and 51 and will return for the Safety Follow-up Visit (Week 54). 
For subjec ts with early termination, end of study proc edures (Week 48) will 
be performed, and subjects will be encour aged to return to the clinic for 
the Safety Fo llow-up Visit after 6 wee ks. Phone call s will be performed to 
asse ss safety at Week 1 and We ek 3 after end of study proc edures are 
perfo
rmed. 
Open Label Extension 
The open label extension (OLE), as described below, was implemented in 
pro
tocol versi ons 4.0 through 6.0. On 16 Febru ary 2021, the Spons or 
termina
ted the OLE portion of the study following notification from the 
Food an d Dru g Administration (FDA) of a partial clinica l hold. Per this 
notification, n o new patient s were enroll ed into OLE, and all active 
participants were discontinued from study treatment with a requirement 
that
 a follow-up visit occur 4 week s after the last dose of COR388. 
Open Label Extension Period 
Subject s who choo se to participate in the OLE portion of the study and 
meet all eligib ility criter ia will begin the treatment period after completing 
the Week 48 Visit. Subject s will rece ive COR388 HCl 40 mg or 80 mg 
treatment orally twice a day for up to 48 weeks and will come back to the 
investigativ e site periodically for scheduled efficacy and safety eva luations. 
Subject s will continue to receive the study drug for 48 weeks, unless the 
Investigator determines  that treatment of a given subject should be 
stopp ed 
or inte rrupted for safety or tolerability reasons, the subject 
withdraws consent, or the Sponsor d e cides to stop the study. 
Open
 Label Extension Safety Follow-up Period 
After completion of study treatment fo r  the OLE, su bjects  will continue to 
be monito red on the study for 6 weeks and will have 2 phone calls to 
asse ss 
safety at Week 9 7 and Wee k 98 and  will return for the Safety 
Follow-up Visit at Week 102. 
For
 subjec ts with early termination, end of study proc edures (Week 96) will 
be performed, and subjects will be encour aged to participate in  the Safety 
Follow-u p phone calls an d return to the clinic for Safety Follow-up Visit.  
Study Population The study will enroll approximately 573 generally healthy male and female 
subjects,  55 and 80 years of age, with mild to moderate probable AD 
dementia according to the NIA-AA criteria, who experienced clinical 
decline in the last year as defined in the study protocol.

Statistical 
Considerations  
The study is designed as an adaptive trial and will allow for stopping early 
for efficacy, futility and potential adjustment in sample size based on the 
results of a planned interim analysis. Approximately 573 subjects are 
planned to be randomized 1:1:1 per treatment group (191 per treatment group) assuming approximately 10% will drop out prior to 48 weeks. This 
sample size would provide approximately 90% power to detect a 2.5-point 
difference between active treatment group and placebo with respect to change from baseline ADAS-Cog 11 score at Week 48, assuming a 
standard deviation of 7.1 at a two-si ded significance level of 0.05 using a 
two-sided test.  The ADCS-ADL was added as a co-primary outcome, with assumptions of a 3.9-point difference between the active treatment group 
compared to placebo with respect to change from baseline on ADCS-ADL, assuming a standard deviation of 10. 5, providing approximately 95% 
power on this outcome measure, with approximately 90% power for the overall co-primary outcomes, depending on their correlation. 
An unblinded interim analysis will be conducted by a firewalled 
independent statistician (all clinical trial personnel will remain blinded) 
when approximately 100 subjects per arm have completed the Week 24 visit.  Overwhelming efficacy, futility and sample size adjustment will be 
evaluated. The Lan-DeMets spending function will be used to determine 
the test boundaries. If the interim analysis is conducted when approximately 300 subjects have completed the Week 24 visit, then a 
si
gnificance level of 0.005 will be used for the interim anal ysis and a 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 15 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information significance level of approximately 0.0456 will be used for the final 
analysis.   
Further details are provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

1. Visit 10/ET MRI will be done only in subjects who had a screening MRI performed and may be done up to 8 days prior to Visit 10/ET. CT scans of the brain 
can be used instead of MRIs, only in subjects who have an absolute contraindication for MRI. 
2. Administer the first MMSE as early in the screening period as possible. MMSE score should be 12 and  24 at both screening and Visit 2, and a 3-point 
difference between visits, for inclusion in the study. 
3. Oral biomarker samples include subgingival plaque and buccal cell swabs (only at selected sites). 
4. Subjects will have follow-up oral examinations at 24 and 48 weeks. 
5. Visit 10/ET oral examinations may be completed up to 8 days prior to Visit 10 (or ET) when applicable. 
6. Baseline (V2) LP must be done after the baseline MMSE score has been verified and subject’s eligibility has been confirmed, and prior to the first dose of 
study drug. To allow flexibilit y of scheduling the LP procedure, the MMSE and then the LP may be performed up to 7 days prior t o baseline V2.  Likewise, the 
LP at Visit10/ET may be performed up to 7 da ys prior to the other visit procedures, even  if the LP is outside the visit window.  The LP procedures must be

Cortexyme, Inc.    Confidential Information performed as per SOC and site specific SOPs, if applicable (i ncluding imaging before and/or during the LP, if required).  
7. A pre-dose trough sample will be drawn at  all visits 2, 3, and 7 immediately prior to the AM dose, and the subject will then take their dose of study drug on-
site. The exact times of AM dosing and PK sample collections at the site will be documented.  A single post-dose sample will be  drawn from each subject 
while on-site at the clinic per the follow ing schedule: V2 30 minutes - 4 hours; V3 60 minutes ± 30 minutes; V7 2 hours ± 30 mi nutes; V9 3 hours ± 30 minutes; 
and V10/ET 4 hours ± 30 minutes.  
8. At visits when the subject takes their dose of study drug on-site, ECGs should be measured approximately 1-1.5 hours after d osing.  
9. At Visit 3 and Visit 7, ECGs will also be performed at trough (prior to dosing).   
10. A urine pregnancy test will be conducted only in women of child bearing potential at screening and End of Treatment or Earl y Termination Visit 10, and at 
other visits only if indicated. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed to confirm pr egnancy. 
11. Only for peri-menopausal (irregular menstrual periods) or post-menopausal (no menstrual peri od for >12 months) female subje cts. 
12. Subjects who want to participate in the open label extension portion of the st udy will complete the Week 48 visit and then continue with the Schedule of 
Evaluations in Table 2. NOTE: Effective 16 February 2021, the OLE portion of  the study was terminated by the Sponsor. 
13. Informed consent will be obtained for subjects who agree to par ticipate in the open label ex tension portion of the study. 
14. Inclusion/exclusion will be evaluated to determine eligibilit y for subjects who want to participate in the open label exten sion portion of the study. Laboratory 
testing and ECG results from Visit 9 will be used to evaluate eligibility. 
15. If a subject is eligible and agrees to participate in the open label extension, the OLE st udy drug (40 mg or 80 mg) will be  dispensed at V10. The subject should 
be instructed to take the first dos e in the morning of the next day. 
16. Liver Safety Monitoring (laboratory analyte testing) must be performed at each study visit within the prespecified visit wi ndow OR the study drug dosing must 
be interrupted until the testing is done.

 2 INTRODUCTION 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continues to cause a tremendous impact on the lives of 
millions of patients and their caregi vers and puts a huge burden on healthcare 
systems worldwide. In the absence of effe ctive disease modifying treatments, AD 
continues to represent a major area of unmet medical need. Cortexyme is 
developing a novel small molecule, COR 388 HCl, for the treatment of AD. The 
development of this compound represents a new paradigm for disease modification 
in AD that is based on a large body of em erging scientific data from both Cortexyme 
and independent researchers, as  detailed in the Investi gator’s Brochure (IB) and 
summarized in the sections below. 
Cortexyme has discovered evidence of Porphyromonas gingivalis  (P. gingivalis [Pg] ) 
in the brains of a large proportion of Al zheimer’s patients compared to controls. 
P. gingivalis  is a Gram-negative asaccharolyt ic pathogen and a keystone bacterium 
in the development of per iodontal disease. Gingipains are cysteine proteases 
produced by Pg that are critical for the survival of the bacteria, host cell toxicity, and 
immune evasion. P. gingivalis infection has been identified as a risk factor for a 
number of chronic inflammatory disease st ates including AD, atherosclerosis, and 
type 2 diabetes. P. gingivalis has been isolated from a variety of human tissues 
indicating systemic translocation beyond the oral cavity. A growing body of 
epidemiological evidence and prospective observational studies link periodontal 
disease, the most prevalent age-related ch ronic infection in humans, to diagnosis 
and rapid decline of AD. Cortexyme conducted a series of experiments to evaluate 
the presence of Pg and gingipains in the brains of  AD patients and control groups, 
explore the role of Pg in the pathogenesis of AD, and evaluate gingipains as a 
therapeutic target. Based on the data summari zed in the IB, Cortexyme believes this 
compound will slow or prevent further neurodegeneration, cogniti ve decline, and 
accumulation of pathology in AD patients. 
COR388 HCl is a proprietary small molecu le that is a potent and selective 
irreversible inhibitor of the bacterial  protease lysine gingipain (Kgp) that was 
selected as a lead compound to progress toward human clinical trials based on its 
selectivity, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety profiles.  
A comprehensive program was conducted to assess the PK, safety, and toxicity of COR388 HCl in 2 animal species and humans. COR388 HCl has a favorable PK profile in animals, and is readily bioavaila ble after oral administ ration, resulting in 
sufficient plasma and central nervous system (CNS) exposures for clinical efficacy. 
COR388 is a chiral molecule whose epimer COR490 is produced in vivo and has a 
similar potency, efficacy and PK profile. COR388 has a moderate level of plasma 
protein binding in animal species te sted and human subjects. COR388 is cleared 
rapidly, with a terminal half-life ranging from  2-3.5 hours in different animal species 
to 4.5-5.0 hours at st eady state in humans. 
No evidence of genotoxicity was found on eit her a battery of in vitro studies in 
bacteria and mammalian cells or in an in vivo micronucleus study. General toxicology studies in mice and dogs s howed no change in serum chemistry, 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 27

Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information 
 hematology, and urinalysis la boratory parameters. Treatment with large doses of 
COR388 was associated with transient cardiovascular effects in dogs. 
Histopathology evaluation with light and fluore scent microscopy, as well as electron 
microscopy, revealed minimal increase in the size and number of intracytoplasmic lysosomes in the brain in mice and dogs and the kidney in dogs. There was no evidence of cellular injury. These were considered an adaptive response by the neurons and renal tubular cells aiming at  clearing excess COR388 and metabolites, 
that may not be expected to occur with the lower exposure levels planned in human trials. These findings were considered non-adverse in dogs at all doses, and in mice 
treated with doses 100 mg/kg/day. After a 28-day recovery period, a complete 
reversal of the findings was found in the kidneys in dogs and the stratum radiatum in 
mice, with partial recovery in ot her parts of the mouse brain. 
Safety pharmacology studies revealed tr ansient, and reversible effects on the 
cardiovascular and CNS systems. The no obser ved adverse effect levels (NOAELs) 
associated with these effects provide large safety margins over the doses used in 
this trial.  
Cortexyme has completed two Phase 1 safety and PK studies. The Phase 1 
program included a single ascending dose study in normal healthy volunteers, and a 
multiple ascending dose study in older healthy volunteers and AD subjects with 
clinical evidence of periodontitis.   
Results from the single ascending dose study showed that COR388 HCl was 
absorbed rapidly after oral administrati on and produced plasma concentrations in 
the presumed therapeutic range and dose propor tional increases in exposures with 
doses ranging from 25 to 150 mg. Clearance was rapid, with a mean half-life (t½) of 2 to 4 hours. Consumption of a high fat meal had a modest effect on COR388 HCl 
exposure, which is not likely to be of clinical relevance. Single doses of COR388 HCl ranging from 5 to 250 mg were safe and well  tolerated when administered to healthy 
volunteers, although there was only 1 subject in the 250 mg dose cohort. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were infrequent, mostly mild in severity, and transient. There were no deaths, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), or TEAEs leading to study drug disconti nuation during the study. There were no 
clinically meaningful changes in safety  laboratory findings, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), vital signs, or physical exami nations observed during the study.  
The multiple ascending dose study revealed  that oral doses of COR388 HCl ranging 
from 25 to 100 mg every 12 hours were sa fe and well tolerated when administered 
to normal healthy volunteers 55 to 70 years of age and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects 58 to 83 years of age. Subjec ts who received COR388 HCl experienced 
infrequent TEAEs, which were mostly mild in severity and transient. There were no deaths, SAEs, or TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation during the study. 
There were no clinically meaningful changes  in laboratory param eters, vital signs, 
ECGs, or physical examination findings observed during t he study. COR388 HCl 
was readily bioavailable after oral adminis tration, with good ti ssue distribution and 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 28 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information rapid clearance. The results of the Phase 1a/b trials are described in more detail in 
the IB.  
Safety and PK data from the Phase 1 a/b program along with appropriate preclinical 
chronic toxicology and other studies enabled Cortexyme to select appropriate doses 
and move forward with the Phase 2/3 program. 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of the study are to:  
Assess the efficacy of 2 dose levels of COR388 HCl in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) subjects; and
Assess the safety and tolerability of 2 dose levels of COR388 HCl in AD
subjects.
4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 
Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will assess the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 2 dos
e levels of COR388 HCl in subjects with 
probable AD dementia according to the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s 
Association (NIA-AA) criteria (McKhann 2011). The study will enroll approximately 
573 generally 
healthy male and female subjects, 55 and 80 years of age. Enrolled 
subjects must have a documented diagnosis of probable AD dementia with clinical 
evidence of progressive cognitive decline in
 the last year. Clinical decline will be 
defined as the evidence of progressive
 cognitive decline on subsequent evaluations 
based on information from informants and/or cogni
tive testing in the context of either 
formal neuropsychological evaluation or standardized mental status examinations for 
probable AD dementia 
(McKhann 2011). The subject should not have other 
conditions or brain imaging abnormality that can explain the symptoms of dementia. 
A Lumbar Puncture (LP) will be performed
 at baseline (Visit 2) and at end of 
treatment period week 48 (Visit 10) or early termination visit (ET). Cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) will be tested for measurement of bacterial DNA (Pg) using quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), biom
arkers of AD, and gingipain activity. Saliva, 
and blood will be analyzed for measurements of biomarkers of AD and 
neuroinflammation, 
and for the presence of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of 
Porphyromonas gingivalis  (P. gingivalis [Pg]) using qPCR.   
A subset of sites will be selected to monitor subjects for clinical evidence of 
periodontitis 
in addition to AD. An oral examination will be conducted by a study 
dentist/hygienist at these sites to assess for the presence of clinical evidence of 
periodontitis. Subjects will have follow-up or al examinations at 24 and 48 weeks. 
Subgingival plaque (SGP) and buccal cell sw
abs will be collected in addition to 
saliva at these sites and analyzed for measurements of biomarkers associated with 
P.
 gingivalis  DNA, proteins, and inflammation.
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 29 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information Due to the nature of AD, subjects must identify a primary caregiver prior to 
enrollment in the study who will as sist the subject with study participation. The 
primary caregiver must sign a caregiver informed consent.  
The safety of study participants will be evaluated throughout the study by repeated 
physical examinations, vital signs, safety laboratory tests,12-l ead electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), C
olumbia-Suicide Severity Ra ting Scale (C-SSRS), magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), and assessments of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs). 
Periodic safety reviews will be conducted during the study.  
The study will consist of 3 periods: a screeni
ng period of up to 6 weeks, a treatment 
period of up to 48 weeks, and a safety fo llow-up period of 6 weeks. An interim 
analys
is may be conducted to reassess the sample size and evaluate for efficacy 
after 24 weeks of treatment
 on key outcome measures. 
During the screening period, the eligibility of subjects will be confirmed according to 
the Schedule of Evaluations (Table 1). 
Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive one of the following treatments: 
80 mg COR388 HCl, twice daily (bid);
40 mg COR388 HCl, bid; or
Placebo, bid.
The study drug will be provided in capsule form for oral administration. All capsules 
will be identical in appearance. 
4.1.1 
Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of COR388 HCl in the 
treatment of AD. Based on the postulated mechanism of action of this compound, 
treatment is expected to slow or pr event further neurodegeneration, cognitive 
decline, and accumulation of pathology in
 AD subjects should COR388 HCl be 
effective. A
vailable data indicate that Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-
Cognitive Subscale 11 (ADAS-Cog 11) score increases by 2-4 points per year on 
average in subjects with mild to moderat
e AD (Ito 2013, Wattmo 2016). Therefore, a 
treatment period of 48 weeks was selected to allow sufficient time to demonstrate at 
least 2.5 points difference between active
 treatment and placebo on ADAS-Cog 11 
at the end of treatment peri od. The doses of 40 and 80 mg were selected to provide 
plasma lev
els of COR388 above the levels found to be therapeutic  in animal models, 
while maintaining safe exposure levels
 based on preclinical and clinical data 
available to date. The objecti ve of the open label extens ion portion of the study is to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of COR388 HCl treatment in all subjects who want 
to participate and meet eligib
ility criteria.  
The frequency of visits is selected to prov ide close monitoring of subjects’ safety, 
without putting undue burden on the subjects
 and their caregivers. Similarly, study 
assessments are selected to provi de 
the essential data needed to assess the 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 30

4.1.3 End of Study Definition 
End of study is Safety Follow-up Visit 11 or Visit OLE-9 (if subject participates in the 
open label extension portion of the study), unless the Investigator determines that 
treatment of a given subject should be stopped or  interrupted for safe ty or tolerability 
reasons, the subject withdraws consent, or the Sponsor decides to stop the study.  
5 STUDY DRUG ADMINIST RATION AND MANAGEMENT 
5.1 Dose Preparation and Administration 
Each subject will receive study treatment according to the randomization scheme. 
The study drug will be provided in capsule form for oral administration. Subjects will 
be instructed to take the capsules with water twice a day, one capsule after waking 
in the morning and one before bed, ideally  12 hours apart and no less than 6 hours 
apart. 
5.2  Randomization to Treatment Groups Subjects who meet all eligibility criter ia will enter the treatm ent period and will be 
randomized 1:1:1 to receive 40 mg COR388 HCl, 80 mg COR388 HCl, or placebo 
twice a day. Randomization will be stratified by baseline MMSE (MMSE 12 and 
18, and MMSE 19 and 24) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4 positive either 
homozygous or heterozygous vs. all others) genotype to assure balanced distribution of mild and moder ate AD and a balanced distri bution of ApoE4 subjects, 
across treatment arms.  All participants will be centrally assigned to randomized 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 32 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information 
 study intervention using an Interactive Resp onse System (IRS). All subjects in the 
open label extension portion of the study will receive 40 mg or 80 mg COR388 HCl. 
5.3 Packaging and Labeling 
Study drug will be packaged in blister packs and assembled into weekly cards each 
containing 16 capsules: 2 capsules fo r each day of the week and 2 additional 
capsules to be used only if instructed by the Investigator (late visits, damaged or lost 
capsules, etc.). The capsules will be i dentical in appearance, but their contents will 
depend on the subject’s treatment assignmen t. The cards containing the blister 
packed capsules will be labeled in comp liance with country- specific labeling 
requirements.  
5.4 Study Drug Supply, Storage, and Handling 5.4.1 COR388 HCl 
The COR388 HCl capsules are orange, opaque, size 3 hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose (HPMC) capsules contai ning the appropriate dose of COR388 HCl 
based on the treatment arm.  The capsules should be stored at room temperature.  
The study drug will be kept in a secure location that is accessible only to study 
personnel whom the Investigator has aut horized to dispense/prepare study drug.
 
5.4.2 Placebo 
The placebo capsules are orange, opaque, size 3 HPMC capsules containing 
microcrystalline cellulose. Pl acebo capsules must be stored at room temperature.  
The placebo capsules will be kept in a secu re location that is accessible only to 
study personnel whom the Investigator has  authorized to dispense/prepare study 
drug.  
5.4.3 Unblinding of Indi vidual Study Subjects  
From Screening (Visit 1) through the Sa fety Follow-up Visit (Visit 11), the 
Investigator should not become unblinded unless knowledge of the treatment is 
required for the subject’s safety and medical care. 
In the event of an SAE requiring identification of the study drug administered to an 
individual subject, the Investigator will access the IRS using the emergency unblinding instructions. The IRS will record the name of the Investigator making the request, the date and time of  the request, and the subject number and age. The 
Sponsor will be informed within 24 hours if unblinding occurs. 
The Investigator will attempt to consult with the Medical Monitor regarding the need 
to unblind the treatment assignment for the subject, if time allows. At all times, the 
safety and well-being of any subject outwe ighs the need to consult with the Medical 
Monitor. In any event, t he Investigator will contac t the Medical Monitor and 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 33 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information 
 Cortexyme within 24 hours of breaking the blind. The Investigator will be responsible 
for documenting the time, date, and reason for the unblinding and the names of the 
personnel involved. Every effort should be made to avoid unblinding other study 
personnel. 
5.5 Drug Inventory and Accountability 
The Investigator must keep an accurate a ccounting of the number of investigational 
product units delivered to the site, dispensed to  subjects, returned to the Investigator 
by the subject, and returned to the Sponsor or other disposition during and at the 
completion of the study. The investigati onal product must be dispensed to subjects 
only by an appropriately qualifi ed person. The investigationa l product is to be used in 
accordance with the protocol by subjects who are under the direct supervision of the 
Investigator. Investigators should maintain  records that document adequately that 
the subjects were provided the doses specified by the protocol and reconcile all 
investigational products received at the site before final disposition. At the end of the 
study, or as directed, all study drugs, in cluding unused, partially used, and empty 
containers, will be returned to the S ponsor/designee or will be destroyed. 
5.6 Treatment Compliance 
Investigational product contai ners must be returned at each  visit, as compliance will 
be assessed by capsule counts. Noncompliance is defined as taking less than 80% 
or more than 120% of investigational product during any out patient evaluation period 
(visit to visit). Discontinuation for noncompl iance is at the Investigator’s discretion 
and is to be noted on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
6 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION 
Investigators should contact the Medica l Monitor if they have questions about 
eligibility of specific subjects. 6.1 Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects will be eligible to participate in this  study if they meet all of the following 
criteria:  
1. Subject has provided full written info rmed consent prior to the performance of 
any protocol-specified procedure; or if unable to provide informed consent 
due to cognitive status, subject has prov ided assent and a legally authorized

health emergency, such as a pandemic, t hen throughout that time, the following 
changes to what is written elsewhere in this  protocol are permissible at the discretion 
of the PI: 
• At-home and/or virtual visits:  Even when an investigative site
remains open to clinical trial patients coming on site, social distancing
strategies may result in some patients being unwilling or unable to
attend protocol-specific clinic visits .  For such reasons, scheduled clinic
visits may be replaced by at-home or virtual visits. This may include
visits by Study Site staff (or home healthcare providers, if applicable)
or virtual visits by videoconference or telephone.
• Safety assessments:  Every effort should be made to continue
performing safety assessments on schedule.  This may require visits by
Study Site staff (or home healthcare providers, if applicable).

administration:
 It is permissible for study drug to be shipped directly to 
the patient and/or caregiver’s hom
e.  It is also permissible for patients 
or caregivers to ship used study drug back to the site.
• Visit windows: For safety assessments, the visit windows will remain
as given in 
Table 1 and Table 2, Schedule of Evaluations.
• Testing at local laboratories: If it is not practical to conduct testing on
site using kits from the central laboratory, then it is permissible to use a
local laboratory instead.

8 STUDY PROCEDURES 
8.1 Informed Consent 
For each trial subject, a written ICF will be obtained before any protocol-related 
activities at Screening (Visit 1).  An addi tional informed consent will be obtained at 
Visit 10 for subjects who qualify and want to participate in the open label extension 
portion of the study ( NOTE:  effective 16 February 2021, t he OLE portion of the study 
was terminated by the Sponsor). As part of this procedure, the Investigator or a 
designated representative must explain orally  and in writing the nature, duration, and 
purpose of the study, and the action of the investigational product in such a manner that the subject and (if applicable) subject’ s legal representativ e are aware of the 
potential risks, inconveniences, or adverse ef fects that may occur.  Subjects, or the 
subject’s legally authorized representative, must be given ample time to decide 
about the study participati on and opportunity to inquire  about details of the 
study.  Subjects should be informed that th ey may withdraw from the study at any 
time.  They will receive all information that is required by local regulations and International Conference on Harmonisa tion (ICH) guidelines. The Principal 
Investigator or a designated representative will provide the Sponsor or its 
representative with a copy of the Inst itutional Review Bo ard (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved ICF before the start of the study. 
The subject or subject’s legally authoriz ed representative must be given a copy of 
the signed ICF, and the original is to be ma intained in the designated location at the 
site. A separate consent may be considered for subjects from sites participating in 
the dental portion of the study.  
The subject’s caregiver must also indica te their understanding of the study and their 
role as a caregiver to the subject during the study.  The subject’s caregiver must 
provide written agreement to their role as caregiver. 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 53 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information To be eligible for the study, subjects must provide an IRB/IEC-approved written 
informed consent, if mentally competent according to IRB/IEC and local guidelines 
for consenting vulnerable populations. If the subject is not able to provide written 
informed consent, written informed consent must be obtained from a legally 
authorized representative on
 the subject’s behalf, and written assent must be 
obtained from the subject.  
Due to the nature of AD, subjects must 
identify a primary caregiver prior to 
enrollment in the study who will assist the subject with study participation. The 
primary caregiver 
must meet specific criteria set by the protocol and be willing to 
sign a caregiver informed consent. 
8.2 
Medical and Medication History 
A complete medical history will be obtained from each subject at Screening (Visit 1). 
The medical history will assess the subject for any disqualifying medical conditions 
as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history will include all 
currently relevant history. When possi
ble, only diagnoses and surgeries will be 
recorded. It is not necessary to collect history for remote, resolved conditions such 
as past pediatric 
illnesses or surgeries, which probably do not affect suitability of the 
subject, unless the examining physician deems these conditions relevant to the 
subject’s current health status. Medication history should include prescription and 
over the counter medications, herbs, vitamins, and minerals. 
Concomitant medications will be recorded at Screening and at all subsequent study 
visits. 
Open Label 
Extension: Concomitant medications will be recorded at all visits and 
phone calls.
 NOTE: Effective 16 February 2021, the OLE portion of the study was 
terminated by the Sponsor. 
8.3 Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) 
The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) ( Folstein 1975) is a widely used and 
validated assessment to be used to evaluate inclusion eligibility as well as an 
exploratory measure. The MMSE will be administered by a trained rater to assess 
the level of cognitive impairment. MMSE will
 be assessed as early in the screening 
period as possible. Subjects with MMSE score of 12-24, inclusive, will have the rest 
of their screening procedures 
performed or scheduled. The MMSE will be 
administered at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 2, Visit 5, Visit 7, Visit 9, Visit 10 (or Early 
Termination), and Visit 11 (Safety Follow-up Visit). The MMSE score should be 
12 and 24 at both Screening (V isit 1) and Visit 2, and a 3-point difference 
between these visits, for inclusion in the study. The MMSE takes approximately 20 
minutes to complete.

8.12 Oral Examination 
An oral examination will be conducted at selected sites by a study dentist or trained 
dental hygienist, to assess for the pres ence of periodontitis during Screening 
(Visit 1). Subjects will have follow-up oral examinations at Visit 7, Visit 10 and Visit 
OLE-6 or Early Termination.  Visit 10/ET and Visit OLE6/ET oral exam inations may be completed up to 8 days 
prior to Visit 10 (or ET), when applicable. 8.12.1 Oral Examination Procedures 
8.12.1.1 Oral Examination 
The screening examination incl udes tooth count, identific ation of any hard or soft 
tissue lesions, assessment for presence of severe dental disease, determination of 
Pocket Depth (PD) and Clinical Attachment  Level (CAL) at 6 sites per tooth 
(distobuccal [DB], buccal [B], mesiobucca l [MB], distolingual [DL], lingual [L], 
mesiolingual [ML]), and assessment of Bleeding on Probing (BOP). All examination 
findings will be entered into the scoring tool, which will assist in the determination of 
the presence or absence of periodontitis . Please note that subjects who are 
otherwise eligible for this GAIN trial, but do not have at least 8 teeth, can still enroll 
in the study, but they are exem pt from the oral examination component of the study.   
8.12.1.2 Measurement of Pocket Depths 
Pocket depths will be measured for each tooth present with a perio dontal probe with 
1 mm gradations on 6 tooth surface sites (MB, B, DB, ML, L, DL) and will be 
rounded down to the nearest millimeter. 
8.12.1.3 Assessment of  Bleeding on Probing 
Bleeding on Probing on all 6 sites of each tooth will be recorded as present (“1”) or absent (“0”) immediately following the PD measures for each of the 4 probed sections of the dentition. 
8.12.1.4 Measurement of Gin gival Margin Position 
The distance of the gingival margin (GM)  to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) on 
each of the 6 sites on the examined teeth will be measured with a periodontal probe 
and rounded down to the nearest millimeter.   
Clinical attachment levels will be calculated as a derived variable at the time of 
statistical analysis from the recorded m easures of PDs and GM to the CEJ.

8.19.1 Monitoring of Laboratory Abnormalities 
All laboratory values will be assessed by t he Investigator to determine clinical 
significance. All abnormal laboratory values c onsidered clinically significant by the 
Investigator will be recorded in the adver se event page of the eCRF. Abnormal 
laboratory values may be considered clinically  significant if they are accompanied by 
signs/symptoms and/or require  medical intervention. Abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study are to be fo llowed until repeat test results return to 
normal (or baseline), stabilize, or t he subject is lost to follow-up. 
8.20 Urine Drug Screen A urine drug screen will be performed at Screeni ng (Visit 1) and at Visit 2. The 
analytes will include opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, and barbiturates. 
8.21 Blood Pharmacokineti c (PK) Evaluations 
At Visit 2 a pre-dose trough sa mple will be drawn immediately prior to the AM dose. 
The subject will take their first dose at t he site with the dose time and date recorded 
in the eCRF. A PK blood draw will be collect ed within the first 4 hours after the dose 
(at any time between 30 minutes to 4 hours post-dose). 
At Visit 3, Visit 7, Visit 9, and Visit 10 (o r Early Termination), subjects will return to 
the clinic prior to taking their AM dos e. A pre-dose trough sample will be drawn at 
Visit 3 and Visit 7 immediately prior to the AM dose. The subjects will then take their 
dose of study drug on-site and the exact time  of the dose ingestion will be recorded. 
A single post-dose sample will be drawn from each subject while on-site at the clinic 
at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes, and at 2 hours ± 30 minutes, respectively.   
At Visit 9 and Visit 10 single post dose sample will be drawn from each subject while 
on-site at the clinic at 3 hours ± 30 mi n and at 4 hours ± 30 min, respectively. The 
exact time of the last dose of study drug will be recorded. 
In all cases, the exact clock time  of each PK sample will be recorded. 
Plasma samples will be quantified for COR388 (and potential metabolites of 
interest). Data will be analyzed by a population pharmacokinetic approach to derive 
COR388 (and potential metabo lites of interest) syste mic exposure metrics. A

Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information detailed population PK  analysis plan will be generated and finalized prior to the PK 
analysis being initiated. 
8.22 Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Evaluations 
The LP procedures, and medical care of the subject, will be administered as per 
clinical site standards including imagi ng prior to procedure, if applicable. 
Cerebrospinal fluid will be tested fo r measurement of bacterial DNA ( Pg) using 
qPCR, biomarkers of AD, and gingipain acti vity. The details of sample collection and 
processing procedures will be provided in  the Laboratory Manual. CSF samples will 
be sent to the central laboratory to be di stributed to a specialty laboratory for 
biomarker analysis. Assessments will be performed up to 7 days pr ior to study drug dosing at Baseline 
(Visit 2) and Visit 10 (or Early Termination). 
8.23 Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
Standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (E CGs) will be performed at Screening 
(Visit 1), Visit 2, Visit 3, Vi sit 4, Visit 5, Visit 7, Visit 9, Visit 10 (or Early Termination), 
and Visit 11 (Safety Follow-up Visit). The Investigator will review ECGs for any 
changes from baseline. At Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 7, Visit 9, and Visit 10 (or Early 
Termination), subjects will take their dose on-site and the exact time of the dose 
ingestion will be recorded. The time to maximum plasma concentration of COR388 
(T
max) is approximately 1-1.5 hours. At visits  when the subject takes their dose of 
study drug on-site, ECGs should be meas ured approximately 1-1.5 hours after 
dosing. At Visit 3 and Visit 7, ECGs will also be performed at trough (prior to dosing). 
ECGs will be reviewed by a cardiologist at the central ECG laboratory to identify any 
abnormalities and verify automatically calc ulated values of RR, PR, QRS, and QTc 
intervals. Clinically significant ECG ev ents and abnormalities will be recorded as 
adverse events. 
Open Label Extension: Standar d 12-lead ECGs will be perform ed at Visits OLE-1, 
OLE-2, OLE-4, OLE-6 (or Early Terminat ion) and OLE-9 (OLE Safety Follow-Up 
Visit). NOTE: Effective 16 February 2021, the OLE portion of the study was

9 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
Throughout the course of t he study, all adverse events (AEs) will be monitored and 
recorded on an AE eCRF, including the AE’s description, start and end date, 
seriousness, severity, action taken, and relati onship to the investigational product. If 
AEs occur, the first concern will be the safety of the study subj ects. All AEs will be 
followed until resolved or stable and t he outcome documented on the eCRF.  
Open Label Extension: Adverse events will be monitored at all visits and phone 
calls. NOTE: Effective 16 February 2021, the OLE portion of the study was 
terminated by the Sponsor.  
9.1 Definitions and Criteria  
9.1.1 Adverse Events  
Per ICH E2A: An AE is any untoward medica l occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relati onship with this treat ment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorabl e and unintended sign (includi ng an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally a ssociated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
Medical interventions such as surgerie s, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic 
procedures are not AEs but the action taken to treat the medical condition.  They 
should be recorded as tr eatment of the AEs. 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 64 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information 9.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that 
at any dose:  
• Results in death
• Is life-threatening• Requires inpatient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization
• Results in persistent or signifi cant disability or incapacity
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect• Is an important medical event (e.g., in tensive treatment in an emergency room
or at home for allergic bronchospasm; bl ood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do
not result in hospitalization; or dev elopment of drug dependency or drug abuse;
malignancy tumors [histologically different from pr imary tumor])
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the defin ition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the ti me of the event; it do es not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
In this study, hospitalization is defi ned to be at least 24-hours in duration. 
Medical and scientific judgem ent should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require in tervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the defin ition above. These should al so usually be considered 
serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The term “severe” is often used to describe t he intensity (severity) of a specific event 
(as in mild, moderate, or se vere); the event itself, however, may be of relatively 
minor medical significance (such as a seve re headache). This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on the outcome  or action associated with events, as 
described above. Seriousness (not severi ty) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
9.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions  An unexpected adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a reaction for which the nature or 
severity is not consistent with the applicab le product information (I B, Package Insert 
for marketed products). Until product info rmation is amended, expedited reporting is 
required for additional occurrenc es of the reaction. Repo rts that add significant 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 65 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information information on specificity or severity of a known, already documented SAE constitute 
unexpected events. For example, an event more specific or more severe than 
described in the IB would be cons
idered "une xpected.” Specific examples would be 
(a)acute renal failure as a labeled ADR with a subsequent new report of interstitial
nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a firs
t report of fulminant hepatitis.
Guidance on reporting AEs and SAEs is described in Section 9.2. 
9.1.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Any abnor
mality in a laboratory value that is new in onset or which has worsened in 
severity or frequency from the baseline condition and  meets 1 of the following 
criteria will be recorded on t he AE pages of the eCRF:  
• Requires therapeutic intervent ion or diagnostic tests;
• Leads to discontinuation of  investigational product;
• Has accompanying or inducing symptoms or signs; and/or
• Is judged by the Investigator  as clinically significant.
9.1.5 Assessing Intensit y and Relationship  
All AEs will be assessed on 2 descriptive parameters: intensity and relationship to 
the investigational product: 
Intensity refers to the severity of an event and references impact on a subject’s
functioning.
Relationship refers to the likelihood that the event being assessed was caused
by the investigational product.
Intensity  
Each AE will be classified according to the following criteria: Mild:  The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the 
subject’s normal level of functioning.  
Moderate:  The AE produces some impairment  of functioning but is not 
hazardous to the subject’s health.  
Severe:  The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or 
incapacitation and is a definit e hazard to the subject’s 
health.  
Relationship 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 66 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information 
 Each AE will be assessed as to its relationship to the investigational product, based 
on the following criteria. Although the attribution by the Investigator will be collected for reported events, for analytic purposes a temporal association with the use of the 
investigational product will be assumed sufficient  for at least plausible association. 
Not related: No causal relationshi p exists between the investigational 
product and the AE, but an obvious alternative cause exists, e.g., the subject’s underlying medical condition or concomitant therapy.  
Possibly related: A connection with the adm inistration of the investigational 
product appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be consid ered possibly related if or 
when it meets 2 of the followi ng criteria: (1) it follows a 
reasonable temporal sequence fr om administration of the 
investigational product; (2) it could not readily have been produced by the subject’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product.  
Related: There is a reasonable/plausible possibility that the AE 
may have been caused by the investigational product. 
When assessing the relationship to the invest igational product, the following criteria 
will be considered:  
• Positive re-challenge (restart of IP  dosing following dosing interruption); 
Note: In this study re-challenge of IP will not be allowed if IP dosing was discontinued for IP-related safety reasons e.g. when a DILI protocol is 
triggered and/or due to an AE that was assessed as possibly or probably 
related to the IP. 
• Positive de-challenge (resolution upon stopping suspect the investigational 
product, in absence of other intervention or treatment); 
• Known class effect; 
• Biological plausibility; and • Lack of alternative explanation —concomitant drug or disease. 
9.2 Reporting Procedures and Requirements  
9.2.1 Adverse Events  Adverse events (AEs) occurring from when t he subject signs the ICF until the last 
study event will be recorded. Any AEs occurri ng before the start of  treatment (i.e., 
before the first dose of the investigationa l product) will be recorded in the medical 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 67 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information history. Also, the sign, symptom, or dis ease present before star ting the treatment 
period are only considered AEs if they wors en after starting the treatment period. 
If
 the Investigator detects an AE in a study subject after the last scheduled follow-up 
visit and considers the event possibly related or related to prior  study treatment, the 
Investigator should report it to the Sponsor / Contract Research Organization (CRO). 
The Investigator should report all AEs on the AE page(s) of the eCRF and source 
documents, regardless of seriousness, seve rity, and causality. Whenever possible, 
an AE
 will be reported using a diagnostic term, (e.g., “c ommon cold”  or “upper  
respira tory infection” rather than “runny  nose, cough, mild fever”) and should be 
described with the attributes  described in Section 9.1.5. 
9.2.2 
Serious Adverse Events 
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it meets seriousness criteria 
(Section 9.1.2). If the AE is  considered serious, the Investigator should report this 
event to the Sponsor and CRO as outlined be low and also to the IRB/IEC according 
to its standard operat ing procedures.  
If the Investigator detects an SAE in a study subject after the last scheduled 
follow-up
 visit, and considers the SAE relate d or  possibly related to prior study 
treatment, the Investigator should report it to the Sponsor and CRO.  
All information about SAEs will be collect ed a nd reported via the SAE form and sent 
by e-mail message or facsimile (contact information will be contained in the 
Invest
igator site file). The Investigator should send the initial report within 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the SAE. At minimum, the initial report should include the 
following  
information:   
Event;
Study code;
Subject number, initials, and date of birth;
Investigational product; and
Reporter name and contact information.
In the case of a “minimum r eport” (one that solely comp rises the information bulleted 
above), a more detailed follow-up report shoul d be sent as soon as more information 
becomes available, but no la ter than 7 calendar days afte r the date of the initial 
report. Each SAE should be followed up until  resolution or stabilization and for 
reported deaths, the Investigator should supply Sponsor/ CRO and the IRB/IEC with 
any additional requested information (e.g., autopsy reports and terminal medical reports).  
The original SAE form should be kept at the study site. The Sponsor or its 
representative will be responsible for det ermining and in turn, reporting SAEs to 
regulatory authorities according to the applicable regulator y requirements.

9.3 
Procedures for Documenting Pregnancy During Study  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, the Investigator will notify 
Sponsor/CRO immediately following 9.1.5 confirmation. The Investigator will also: (1)
notify the subject’s physician that
 the subject may have been treated with COR388 
HCl and (2) follow the progress of the pregnancy to term and document theoutcome 
of the pregnancy. Subjects who
 become pregnant during the study will not be eligible 
for any further study treatments. Pregnancy outcome information should be 
forwarded to Sponsor/CRO when availa
ble. The Investigator and Cortexyme  will
determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the subject will continue in the study
and, if so, which stud
y measures will be collected.
9.4 T
reatment of Investig ational Product Overdose 
There is currently no information avai lable regarding pot ential overdosing of 
COR388 HCl. Based on the effe cts observed in preclinical safety and toxicology 
studies, adverse effects that could be anticipated from exposur e to overdoses of 
COR388 HCl are cardiovascular, CNS, and respiratory effects. 
As there are no data availa
ble with regar d to overdose of COR388 HCl in humans, 
there is no specific treatment
 to be used in the event of an overdose.  Investigators 
should use their clinical judgment in treating cases of overdose as dictated by the 
subject’s clinical status. 
In the event of a suspected overdose, and if
 in the opinion of the Investigator the 
patient does not require emergency clinical treatment, the Invest igator or treating 
physician should:
 
Contact the Medical Monitor immediately.
Have the subject come to the clinic as soon as possible to draw blood for
clinical laboratory testing.
Closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities
and ensure appropriate clinical managem ent. Overdose in the absence of
other AEs will not be reported as an AE in its own right.
Document the quantity of  the excess dose, as well as the time of
administration of the ov erdose, in the eCRF.
Subjects should be observed closely in a medical facility whereappropriate supportive care is  available, if required.

10.1 Bioanalytic Method Validation 
Bioanalytic methods employed in this study have been validated according to 
existing standard operating pr ocedures of the Sponsor  and of the laboratory 
performing the analysis, in compli ance with relevant regulation. 
11 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS 
11.1 General Considerations 
The statistical analyses  are described in this section. Further details will be provided 
in the Statistical Analy
sis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock 
and unblinding for the interim analysis.  Any deviations from the analyses described 
belo
w will be includ ed in the SAP.   
All efficacy and safety measures over the course of the study will be presented.  
Continu
ous data will be summari zed by m eans, standard deviations (SDs), medians, 
maximum, minimum, and number of subjects .  Categorical data will be summarized 
by counts and percentages. 
11.2 
Determination of Sample Size 
The study will have an adaptive design that a llows for potential adjustment in sample 
size and evaluation of efficacy based on t he results of a planned interim analysis.  
An unblinded interim analysis will be c onducted by a firewalled independent 
statistician (all clinical tr ial personnel will remain blinded) when approximately 100 
subjects per arm have completed the Week 24 visit.   Approximately 573 subjects 
are planned to be randomized 1:1:1 per treatment group (191 per treatment group) 
assuming approximately 10% will drop out prior to 48 weeks.  Due to the planned 
interim analysis, adjus
tments will be made to the alpha level used in the final 
analys
is to control for overall Type I error.  The final crit erion for efficacy to be used 
at the interim and final analysis depends on when the interim analysis occurs. The 
Lan-DeMets method modified according to Chen et al. (2004) to account for 
correlation between endpoints used at the interim and final analyses will be used to 
calculate the level of significance for each analysis. As originally planned, with 573 
subjects randomized, an expected 10% disc ontinuation rate, and a single primary 
outcome, a total of 172 subjects per treat ment group would prov ide approximately 
90% power to detect a 2.5-point differ ence between the active treatment group 
compared to placebo with respect to change from baseline on the ADAS -Cog 11, 
assuming a standard deviation of 7.1, respecti vely at a significance level (alpha) of 
0.05 using a two-sided test.  The ADCS-A DL was added  as a co-primary outcome, 
with assumptions 
of a 3.9-point difference between the active treatment group 
compared to placebo with respect to change from baseline on ADCS-ADL, ass uming 
a standard deviation of 10.5, providing appr oximately 95% power on this outcome 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 70 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information measure, with approxim ately 90% power for the overal l co-primary outcomes, 
depending on their correlation.   
These results assume that 2 sequential tests will be made using the Lan-DeMets 
spending function to determine the test boundarie s. Therefore, if an interim analysis 
is conducted when approximately  300 subjec ts have completed the Week 24 visit, 
then a significance lev
el of 0.005 will be used for the interim analysis and a 
significance level of approximately 0.0456 will be used for the final analysis.  As 
discussed by 
Chen et al 2004, the sample size re-estimation procedure based on 
promising zone will not inflate the type I error and no statistical adjustment is 
necessary.  However, the adjuste
d alpha at the end of the study will be based on the 
new sample size at the final analysis. 
11.3 Final Analysis 
11.3.1 Analysis Populations 
Intent-To-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT populat ion will include all subjects who
are randomized regardless of whether or not they took study drug. This
population will serve as the basis for all efficacy analyses. When change from
baseline is assessed, subjects will be included in the analysis only if both a
baseline and a postbaseline measure are available.
The Per Protocol population (PP): The PP population will include all ITT subjects
who do not have any major protocol deviati ons that would affe ct efficacy (e.g.,
<80% treatment compliance, taking a prohibited medication).  Major protocoldeviations will be reviewed and determi ned prior to unblinding.  The
PP population will be used for suppor tive sensitivity analyses.
Safety Population: The Safety population will include all subjects who receive at
least one dose of study drug. Safety analyses will be performed using the Safetypopulation, and subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they actuallyreceive.
11.3.2 Efficacy Analysis 
11.3.2.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The co-primary endpoints are the mean c hange from baseline in  ADAS-Cog 11 at 
the end of the study (average of W eeks 40 and 48), and the mean change from 
baseline in the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperati ve Study – Activities of Daily Living 
(ADCS-ADL) at the end of the study (average of Weeks 40 and 48).   
Each of the coprimary endpo ints will be analyzed using a mixed-effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) with SAS PROC MIXED to compare change from 
baseline for COR388 HCl vs placebo.  T he MMRM model will include treatment 
group, study visit, site/country, treatment gr oup by study visit interaction as fixed 
effects, and baseline MMSE (average of  the last two non-missing assessments

 and/or mema ntine usage at baseline as factors with 
baseline score as a covariate using the ITT population. The analysis will be based 
on unstructured covariance matrix to model the within-subject errors. A Kenward-
Roger
 approximation will be used for the denominator degrees of freedom.   
Summary
 statistics (n, mean, standard dev iation, minimum, median, and maximum) 
will be presented for the observed values  for each of the coprim ary endpoints at 
each time point  for the ITT population,  including weeks 40 and 48 separate as  well 
as
 averaged.  Summary statistics will also b e presented for the change from 
baseline values to each postbaseline time point as listed above.   
The Type I error for the interim  and final  analysis will be adjusted using the Lan-
DeMets spending function. Detailed of the adjustment is presented in 
Section 11.3.2.3 and in the SAP. 
Treatment comparisons of
 40 mg and 80 mg COR388 HCl to placebo will be 
adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg multiplicity adjustment procedure (Benjamini 
and
 Hochberg, 1995 and Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001).  Both treatment 
comparisons , 40 mg (low dose) and 80 mg COR388 HCl (high dose) to placebo are 
considered of equal interest.  
11.3.2.1.1 Sensitivity
 Analyses 
The following sensitivity analyses will be per formed on each of the co-primary 
endpoints:
 
Repeat above analysis using the PP population.
Impute missing values using a last z-score carried forward method
(converted back to the original sc
ale) and analyze the primary endpoint
(Average of Weeks 40 and 48 only) using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
with fixed effects of trea
tment group, ApoE4 status, acetylcholinesterase 
inhibitor and/or memantine usage, site/country and baseline MMSE with 
baseline score as a covariate.
Pattern mixture model:
The pattern-mixture model approach uses a control-based pattern imputation
(Ratitch and O’Kelly, 2011). With this approach, subjects who discontinued
from the COR388 HCl 80 mg or COR388 HCl 40mg treatment group will be 
assumed to follow a similar outcome trajectory as subjects from the placebo 
(control) arm and subjects who discont
inued from placebo (control) treatment
are modeled as completers within thei
r own arm (MAR within control arm).
That is, the imputation model for the missing observations in the active
treatment groups are constructed not from the observed data in the
corresponding 
active treatment group but rather from the observed data in the
placebo treatment group. This model is also the imputation model that will be 
used to impute missing observations in the placebo treatment group. This will

17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information be implemented by utilizing the MONOTO NE REG statement of SAS® PROC 
MI with the option nimpute=5. 
Pattern mixture model tends to overestima te the already very large variability 
in Alzheimer’s disease data, these model results are likely to be much less 
able to discriminate treatment differences  than the primary model. The results 
of this imputation method wil l primarily be used to assess the potential bias of 
the main model estimates due to dr opout by comparing the estimates 
between the primary and sensitivity models. 
Additional subgroups including g ender, demographic, and other baseline 
characteristics may be performed.  Furt her details will be given in the SAP. 
11.3.2.2 Secondary Endpoint Analyses 
Secondary endpoints will be analyz ed for the ITT population only. 
The analysis of secondary endpoints will use t he same methodology as that for the 
primary endpoint analysis but adjusting for corresponding baseline value as a 
covariate. Treatment com parisons of 40 mg and 80 mg COR388 HCl to placebo for 
the secondary endpoints at 24-week or 48-w eek will be performed only if both co-
primary endpoints compared to placebo are statistically  significant. Otherwise, 
secondary endpoints will be presented using descriptive statistics  
11.3.2.3 Multiplicity 
To control for type I error, for the interi m and final analysis will be adjusted using the 
Lan-DeMets spending function.  If the study  does not stop at the interim analysis 
(i.e., 24 weeks ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB as co-p rimary endpoints) for overwhelming 
efficacy or futility, the study will retain its original design and the final analysis will be 
based on 48 weeks of treatment with AD AS-Cog and ADCS-ADL as co-primary 
endpoints. Because of the changes in co -primary endpoint at 48 weeks (i.e., CDR-
SB 24-week replaced by ADCS-ADL at 48-week and ADAS-Cog 24-week replaced 
by ADAS-Cog 48-week), the Lan-DeMets correction for sequential analysis will be 
further adjusted as described in Chen et al., (2014). This adjustment will account for 
the correlation between the outcomes and time points. The boundaries will be 
calculated to account for the change in ti ming of evaluation and endpoint and the 
more conservative boundary will be used for final analysis at 48-week.   
At both the interim analysis at 24 weeks and fi nal analysis at 48 weeks, to adjust for 
comparison between placebo and each of  the two doses, Benjamini-Hochberg 
multiplicity adjustment procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 and Benjamini and  
Yekutieli, 2001 ) will be used.  Both treatment comparisons, 40 mg (low dose) and 80 
mg COR388 HCl (high dose) to placebo ar e considered of equal interest.   
Treatment comparisons of  40 mg and 80 mg COR388 HCl to placebo for the 
secondary endpoints at 24-week or 48-w eek will be performed only if both co-

17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information primary endpoints compared to placebo are statistically significant at the level of 
approximately 0.005 or 0.0456 for the in terim analysis and final analysis, 
respectively. Otherwise, secondary endpoi nts will be presented using descriptive 
statistics.  
11.3.2.4 Exploratory Endpoints 
Exploratory endpoints will be analyzed for the ITT population only.  No adjustment 
for multiplicity will be done.   
Further details of the analyses to be performed will be provided in the SAP. 
11.3.3 Safety Analysis 
11.3.3.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be coded by Preferred Term (PT) using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification.  
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any AE that has an onset 
on or after the first dose of study drug,
 or any pre-existing condition that has 
worsened on or after the first dose of study drug. The incidence of TEAEs, 
treatment-related TEAEs, SAEs includ
ing de aths, TEAEs that lead to discontinuation 
of investigational product, and TEAEs by ma ximum severity and relationship to study 
drug will be summarized by MedDRA system or gan class, PT, an
d treatment group.   
To assess the potential for abuse associated with the administration of 
COR388 HCl, a systematic review of TEAE terms suggestive of the potential for 
abuse will be conducted for all clinical studies
 in subjects who received at least 1 
dose of COR388 HCI and a summary of this information will be included in the 
regulatory submission. 
As a general framework for data collection and analysis we 
will use the overall abuse flag terms in the FDA Guidance (2017). 
Since the target patient population are elderly, have subs tantial comorbidity and are 
often on other medications, a careful 
assessment and documentation of adverse 
event causality will be made in order to ensure that false positive TEAE signals for 
abuse are not generated. For example, di zziness and sedation or sleepiness are 
common clinical events in elderly patients with Alzheimer’s disease. 
Since to date no abuse related TEAE attributable to COR388 HCl have occurred, 
focus will be on a restricted set of index events for which narratives will only be 
prepared where the causality relationship to
 COR388 HCl is proba ble or definite. 
Information included in the narratives will consist of time to onset/offset, time course 
of severity, all concurr
ent events, concu rrent medications, and time of onset of 
events relative to ingestion of COR388 HCl. 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 74

Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information 
 The index TEAEs will include: 
• Any reports of altered perception or hallucinations • Dizziness • Euphoric mood • Feeling drunk • Feeling of relaxation • Sedation • Somnolence 
11.3.3.2 Laboratory Data 
Laboratory data (hematology, blood chemistry, and uri nalysis parameters) will be 
presented for each treatment group using descriptive statistics, including mean and mean change from baseline values at eac h scheduled time point. Shift tables will 
display numbers of subjects with norma l/abnormal values at baseline versus 
post-treatment. The frequency of labor atory abnormalities will be tabulated. 
By-subject data listings will flag laboratory va lues that are outside normal reference 
ranges or markedly abnormal findings. 
11.3.3.3 Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics for observed values  and change from baseline in vital sign 
parameters [blood pressure (systolic and di astolic), body temperature, pulse, and 
respiratory rate] will be presented by visit and treatment group.  
11.3.3.4 Electrocardiograms 
Descriptive statistics for observed values  and change from baseline in (continuous) 
ECG parameters (e.g., RR, PR , QTc) will be presented by vi sit and treatment group.   
Shift tables in relation to overall inte rpretation (Normal, Abnormal Not Clinically 
Significant [NCS] and Abnormal Clinically Significant [CS] ) from baseline to each 
post-baseline visit will be presented.  
11.3.3.5 Other Safety Assessments 
The C-SSRS will be summarized at each vi sit by treatment using descriptive 
statistics. 
Abnormal physical examinations and MRI results will be summarized descriptively 
by visit and treatment group. 
11.3.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Treatment groups will be co mpared with respect to subject demographics, and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized us ing descriptive statistics. No formal 
statistical analysis tests will be performed.

Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information 11.3.5 Interim Analysis 
The purpose of the interim analysis is to det ermine if COR388 HCl is efficacious and 
conduct a sample size re-estimation. One unblinded interim analysis will be performed 
after approximately 300 subjects have comp leted 24 weeks of treatment. The DMC 
will review unblinded data for the mean change from baseline in ADAS-Cog 11 and 
the mean change from baseline in the CDR- SB post 24 weeks of treatment. Both 
treatment comparison s will be assessed at the interim analysis: 40 mg COR388 HCl 
and 80 mg COR388 HCl vs. placebo for the tw o co-primary endpoints (i.e., mean 
change from baseline in ADAS-Cog 11 an d mean change from baseline in CDR-SB 
at Week 24). Analyses will be performed as spec ified in the approved final study SAP. 
The DMC should return to the Sponsor one of four recommendations as follows: 
Stop the study early for overwhelming efficacy defined as p<0.005 adjusted for
multiplicity using the 
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for both ADAS-Cog 11 and
CDR-SB in favor of either 40 mg COR388 or 80 mg COR388 HCl over placebo;
Stop either or both arms (stopping b oth arms would m ean stopping the study)
early for futility defined as p<0.05 on either ADAS-Cog 11 or CDR-SB in favor of
placebo over active dose(s), and the other endpoint for the same dose is
directionally favoring placebo;
Continue 
with no sample size adjustment; or
Continue with an appropriate sample size adjustment
Interim comparative data will be most se curely protected from inadvertent or 
inappropriate access by the Sponsor. Sponsor will remain blinded to all information except the DMC recommendations.   
11.3.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plasma levels of COR388 wi ll be determined from blood samp les collected at Visit 2, 
Visit 3, Visit 7, Visit 9, and Visit 10 (or Early Termination). 
Descriptive statistics (sample size, mean,  SD, minimum, median, and maximum) will 
be calculated for all results. Geometric me an and geometric coefficient of variation 
(CV)% will also be calculated for PK parameters. 
12 STUDY MANAGEMENT 12.1 Regulations and Guidelines 
The study will be performed in accordance with this protocol, United States IND 
regulations (21 Code of Federal Regulation s [CFR] 312) or local national laws (as 
applicable), ICH guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and the most recent

 guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. These guidelines are on file at the Sponsor 
and/or CRO . 
12.2 Institutional Review Boar d/Independent Ethics Committee 
Conduct of the study must be approved by an appropriately constituted IRB or IEC. 
Approval is required for the study protocol, investigatio nal drug brochure, protocol 
amendments, ICFs, subject information sheets, and advertising materials. No 
investigational product will be shipped to a site until written IRB/IEC authorization 
has been received by the Spons or or its representative.  
12.3 Discontinuation of th e Study by the Sponsor 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue  the study at this site or at multiple 
sites for safety or administrative reasons at any time. In particular,  a site that does 
not recruit at a reasonable rate may be di scontinued. Should t he study be terminated 
and/or the site closed for whatever reas on, all documentation and investigational 
product pertaining to the study must be retur ned to the Sponsor or its representative.  
12.4 Study Documentation 
By signing a copy of Form FDA 1572 or other  country-specific regulatory forms, the 
Principal Investigator acknowledges that he/she has received a copy of the IB on 
COR388 HCl and assures the Sponsor that he/she will comply with the protocol and 
the provisions stated in Form FDA 1572 and other country-specific forms. No 
changes in this protocol can be made without the Sponsor’s written approval.  
12.5 Study Monitoring and Auditing 
This study will be monitored for quality assurance at all stages of its development by 
the clinical research personnel employed by the Sponsor or its representative. 
Monitoring will include remote (virtual) dat a reviews, personal visits, and telephone 
communication to assure that the invest igation is conducted according to the 
protocol, standard operating procedures, Guidelines of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirem ents. Quality control proc edures will be applied to 
each stage of data handling to ensure t hat all data are re liable and have been 
processed correctly. On-site and remote re view of eCRFs will include a review of 
forms for completeness and clarity, and consistency with source documents 
available for each subject. Note that a va riety of original documents, data, and 
records will be considered as source documents in this trial.  Procedures for handling 
source documents remotely will be described in the Clinical Monitoring Plan. The eCRF itself is not to be used as a s ource document under any circumstances.  
Medical advisors and Clinica l Research Associates (CRAs) or assistants may 
request to witness subject evaluations o ccurring as part of this protocol. The 
Investigator and appropriate personnel wi ll be periodically requested to attend 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 77 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information meetings/workshops organized by the Spons or to assure acceptable protocol 
execution. The study may be subject to audit by the Sponsor or by regulatory 
authorities. If such an audit occurs, the Inve stigator must agree to allow access to 
required subject records. By signing this protocol, the Investigator grants permission 
to personnel from the Spons or, its representatives, and appropriate regulatory 
authorities, for remote and on- site monitoring of all appropr iate study documentation, 
as well as on-site review of the procedur es employed in eCRF generation, where 
clinically appropriate. 
12.6 Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to review 
accumulating 
study data to monitor the safety of subjects enrolled in COR388-010 
on an ongoing basis and review the interi
m analysis (see Section 11.3.5).  All 
members will be independent of the study (e.g., not a participating site employee, 
Cortexyme employee, etc.). 
The DMC will review data on a regular basis.
  After reviewing the safety data, the 
DMC may make a recommendation to continue the study  with or without 
modification or terminate the study.  The DMC Charter defines all DMC 
responsibilities, 
functions, membership, meeting structure, communications , DMC 
SAP, and rules for decision making. 
12.7 Retention of Records 
The Investigator must arrange for retention of  study records at the site. The nature of 
the records and the duration of the retenti on period must meet the requirements of 
the relevant regulatory author ity. In addition, because this  is an international study, 
the retention period must meet  the requirements of the mo st stringent authority. The 
Investigator should take measures to prev ent accidental or prem ature destruction of 
these documents.  
12.8 Use of Study Findings 
By signing the study protocol, the Investi gator agrees to the us e of results of the 
study for the purposes of national and inter national registration. If necessary, the 
authorities will be notified of the Investigator’s name, address, qualifications, and 
extent of involvement. Reports covering c linical and biometric as pects of the study 
will be prepared by the Sponsor  or its representative. 
12.9 Publications 
As a multicenter trial, the Sponsor intends to publish clin ical data from all centers 
participating in the investi gation. A publication committee selected by the Sponsor 
will submit draft manuscripts to all partici pating investigators fo r their comments. In 
conformity with the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts  Submitted to Biomedical 
Journals published by the International Comm ittee of Medical J ournal Editors (see 
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 78 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information discussion in Kassirer & Angell, 1991), investigators whose contribution consists 
solely in the collection of data will not be named individually as authors. Rather, 
those investigators will receive a collective authorship as the “COR388 Study Group” 
and will be identifie d in a note.  
Individual investigators 
and/or their asso ciates subsequently may publish additional 
findings of this study in scientific journal s or present them at scientific meetings, 
provided that the Sponsor is given ampl e opportunity to review any proposed 
abstract, 
manuscript, or slide presentation before its submission. This review is 
required to ensure that the Sponsor is aware of all written and oral presentations of 
the data and does not imply any editorial review
 or restriction of the contents of the 
presentation or use. 
12.10 Subject
 Privacy 
To maintain subject confidentiality, a ll eCRFs, study repor ts, and communications 
relating to the study will identify subjects by initials and assigned subject numbers.  
As required by federal regul ations , the Investigator will allow Cortexyme and/or the 
CRO CRA access to all pertinent medical record s in order to allow for the verification 
of data gathered in the eCRFs
 and for the review of the data collection process. The 
FDA (or other regulatory authority) may al so request access to all study records, 
including source documentation for inspection. 
As applicable, in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) and associated privacy regulat ions, a subject authorization to use 
personally identifiable health infor
mation may be required from each subject prior to 
research activities. This authorization document must clearly specify what parties will 
have acces
s to a subject’s personal health inf ormation, for what purpose, and for 
how long. 
12.11 Amendments to the Protocol 
Any amendments to the study protocol will be communicated to the investigators by 
the CRO or the Sponsor. All protocol amendments will undergo the same review and 
approval process as the original pr otocol. A protocol amendment may be 
implemented after it has been approved by  the IRB/IEC, and, where appropriate, 
competent regulatory authority approval prior to impl ementation, unless immediate 
implementation of the change is necessary for subject safety. In this case, the 
situation must be documented and reported to  the IRB within 5 working days and in 
the countries outside of the United States according to the national regulation. 
Any departures from protocol must be fully documented in the source documentation 
and in a protocol deviation log. 
12.12 Case Report Form Completion 
Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be employed for this study.  Completed eCRFs for this 
study will be forwarded to the Sponsor or its representative, where editing and

double- entered, and electronically verified bef ore entry into the database. Queries 
will be issued for any i
nconsistencie s, omissions, and discrepancies and will be 
resolved by the appropriate parties.  The statistical ana lysis of these data will be 
performed by the Sponsor or its representative.  A ll AEs will be coded using the 
latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
Concomitant medications will be coded using t he latest version of the World Health 
Organizatio
n Drug Dictionary.  Data m anagement details will be outlined in a 
separate data managem
ent plan. 
12.13 Removal of Subjects fr om Therapy or Assessment 
Liver Safety Monitoring (laboratory analyte testing) must be performed at each study 
visit within the prespecified visit window (see Table 1 and Table 2, Schedule of 
Evaluations) OR the study dr ug dosing must be temporarily halted until the testing is 
done.  
Subjects who discontinue IP dosing for IP-related safety reasons will not be 
permitted to resume IP treatment and must be followed until the safety concern (e.g. 
transaminase elevations) or an existing AE has stabilized or resolved/returned to 
baseline. At that time subject’s partici pation in the study mu st be terminated early 
and V10/ET procedures must be performed. Subjects should remain in the study 
through final 6-weeks safety follow up perio d which ends with a final study visit. 
A subject will be considered to have comple ted the study when he or she completes 
Visit 11. If a subject is discontinued at any  time after randomization into the study, 
the Investigator will make every effort to follow the subject and complete the 
Visit 10/Early Termination assessments.  
A termination electronic case report form (eCRF) page shoul d be completed for 
every subject who receives investigati onal product, whether or  not the subject 
completes the study. The reason for any ear ly discontinuation should be indicated 
on this form. The primary reason for a s ubject discontinuing early should be selected 
from the following st andard categories of early termination:  
•Adverse Event (Adverse Reaction) : Clinical or laboratory events occurred that,
in the medical judgment of the Investigator for the bes t interest of the subject, 
are grounds for discontinuation. Th is includes serious and nonserious 
adverse events (AEs) regardless of rela tion to the investigational product.  
•Death: The subject died.
•Withdrawal of Consent : The subject desired to  withdraw from further
participation in the study in the absence of an Investigator-determined 
medical need to withdraw. If the subj ect gave a reason for withdrawing, it 
should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Protocol COR388-010  Version 7.0 Page 80 
17 May 2021 
Cortexyme, Inc.  Confidential Information 
 • Protocol Violation : The subject’s findings or conduct failed to meet the protocol 
entry criteria or failed to adhere to the protocol require ments (e.g., drug 
noncompliance, failure to return for defined number of visits). The violation 
necessitated early discontinuation from the study.  
• Lost to Follow-Up : The subject stopped coming for visits and study personnel 
were unable to contact the subject.  
• Other : The subject was discontinued for a r eason other than those listed above, 
such as theft, loss of investigationa l product, or termination of study by 
Sponsor. 
12.14 End of the Study 
For regulatory purposes, the definition of  the end of the study is database lock.

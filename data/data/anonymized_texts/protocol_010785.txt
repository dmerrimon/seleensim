Happy Family, Healthy Kids: An Intergenerational Program to Promote Healt hy Eating 
Habits 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
Date: August 23, 2022
Theoretical Framework  
The “Happy Family, Healthy Kids ” program was grounded in the Actor -Partner 
Interdependence Model  (Cook & Kenny, 2005) , the Allostatic Load Model  (McEwen, 2000) , and 
the Transactional Theory of Stress and Coping  (Lazarus & Folkman, 1987) . The Actor -Partner 
Interdependence Model has been used in lifestyle behavioral and mental health interventions to 
better understand the intergenerational interactions and relationships inside a family  (Braithwaite 
& Fincham, 2011; Vedanthan et al., 2016) . The Actor -Partner Interdependence Model 
demonstrates the bidirectional relationship between preschoolers  and parents: 1) actor effects 
within preschoolers  or parents and 2)  partner effects between preschoolers  and parents  (Cook & 
Kenny, 2005) .  
According to the Allostatic Load Model  (McEwen, 2000)  and the Transactional Theory 
of Stress and Coping  (Lazarus & Folkman, 1987) , to respond to stress, individuals first 
cognitively appraise external stressors according to their harm, threat, or challenge. Then , they 
respond to the appraised stressors with different coping strategies including problem -focused 
coping, emotion -focused coping, and avoidant coping. Problem -focused coping focuses on 
making cognitive and behavioral effort to change a stressful situation in a positive way (Lazarus 
& Folkman, 1987) . Emotion -focused coping involves regulat ing difficult emotions such as anger, 
fear, anxiety, depression, frustration, and sadness that are associated with stress (Lazarus & 
Folkman, 1987) . Avoidant coping is a maladaptive form of coping that includes denying or 
avoiding the stressful situations or feelings to temporarily reduce stress (Penley, 2002) . When the 
selected coping strategies fail to manage the external stressors, the cumulative burden of chronic 
stress (allostatic load) can lead to poor health outcomes such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, 
anxiety, and depression  (Guidi et al., 2021; Lazarus & Folkman, 1987; McEwen, 2000) . 
Fortunately, maintaining a healthy lifestyle , such as having healthy diet , is associated with lower 
allostatic load, resulting in improved physical and mental health  (Forrester et al., 2019; Mattei et 
al., 2013) . Based on information from the theory and models , the “Happy Family, Healthy Kids ” 
program focus ed on the connections between F/V intake  and mental health to strengthen both 
preschoolers’  and parents’  adaptive coping strategies  (e.g., mindful eating ) and reduce 
maladaptive coping strategies (e.g., emotional eating ) to enhance their overall well -being .  
Methods  
Study Design , Setting , and Sample  
 A one -group quasi -experimental study was  conducted in 13 Michigan Head Start centers 
across two academic years . In Year 1, three urban Head Start centers (eight classrooms) and 
three rural Head Start centers (five classrooms) participated . In Year 2, four urban Head Start 
centers (five classrooms) and three rural Head Start centers (five classrooms) participated. The 
total enrollment from the 23 Head Start classrooms was 374 preschoolers, and 127 (34%) of the 
families were initially interested in participating in the study. Of the 127 families , 20 were 
excluded due to not meeting the inclusion criteria  or declin ing to participate or for other reasons. 
A total of 107 parent -preschooler dyads  were enrolled in the study, but four preschoolers did not 
receive the program due to being dropped out of the Head Start programs. The study flow 
diagram is presented in Figure 1.  
 We recruited parent -preschooler dyads using the following two strategies: 1) Head Start 
teachers and family engagement specialist s shared the recruitment flyer with their classroom 
families ; and 2) at urban settings, the study project manager and trained research assistants 
recruited participants and answered questions in-person during daycare drop -offs and pick -ups. 
A $5 e -gift card was distributed to the families who completed the enrollment and screening 
survey.  
 Sample size was estimated using the freely available G*Power software . With the study 
design being  one-group quasi -experimental and a significance level of 0.05, a sample size of 90 
would achieve 80% study power to identify a small effect size of 0.30 , and a sample size of 102 
would achieve 85% power . Inclusion criteria were: 1) child was 3 -5 years old and enrolled in a 
participating Head Start program; 2) parent was the primary caregiver for the child, had at least 
weekly Internet access, and was willing to use Facebook to participate; 3) dyad was able  to speak 
and understand English; and 4) parental c onsent and child assent (if child was five years old) 
were obtained. Preschoolers were excluded if they had any medical conditions preventing them 
from participating in dietary changes. University Institutional Review Board approved the 
project, and parents’ consent and 5-year-old preschoolers’ verbal assent were obtained.  
“Happy Family, Healthy Kids” Program  
 Table 1 demonstrates the three components of t he 14 -week healthy eating and stress 
management program . Each participating family received a crockpot and a program “ Healthy 
Tasty  Cookbook ” to promote healthy family meals at home, an adult and a child MyPlate plates 
to encourage  appropriate portion size and healthy eating habits, and a community resource 
booklet to share community resources on healthy eating (e.g., local farmers markets) and stress 
management (e.g., mindfulness classes , local trails for walking in nature ).  
Measurements and Data Collection  
As demonstrated in Table 2, reliable and valid instruments were selected to assess 
program outcomes  at two time points: baseline and post -program. Parents completed an online 
survey measuring their nutrition knowledge, self -efficacy, support, child feeding 
beliefs/attitudes/practices, food resource management behavior, perceived stress, coping 
strategies, dietary intake, home eating environment, emotional eating, and food insecurity via 
Qualtrics. A face -to-face appointment was scheduled with each parent -preschooler dyad to 
objectively measure their height to the nearest 0.1cm using the Shorr board, weight to the nearest 
0.1kg using  the Seca 874 scale, % body fat to the nearest 0.1% using the BF-689 body fat/body 
water monitor for preschoolers and BC -533 Inne rScan body composition monitor for parents, 
and parents’ BP to the nearest 1 mmHg using the Omron HEM -705-CP digital BP monitor.  
For h eight, weight, and % body fat measurements, participants were asked to remove  
shoes, socks, or bulky clothes. To avoid interference with height measurements, p articipants 
were  asked to remove their accessories or change hairstyles (no ponytail) when applicable. If a 
participant refuse d, trained data collectors would  obtain the height measurment as well as 
measure hairdo height (using small, flexible plastic ruler) and record both types of information 
on the data collection form. Each p articipant’s biological sex, age, and height in cm w ere entered 
into the monitor for measuring % body fat . Trained data collectors then instructed participant s to 
step on to the monitor  surface and align feet with the four electrodes. The protocol by the 
American Heart Association  (2020)  was followed for  BP measurement . Parents’ left arms were 
used for BP measurement unless  having a prior surgery or injury . 
To increase reliability for measuring height, weight, % body fat, and BP, two 
measurements w ere taken. A third measurement was taken when  the first two measurements 
differ ed by ≥0.5 cm for height, ≥0.5 kg for weight, ≥1% for % body fat, and ≥5 mmHg for BP. 
The data collection process was repeated  by another data collector when  the third mesurement 
was ≥0.5 cm, ≥0.5 kg, ≥1%, and ≥5 mmHg away  from the first two measurements.  The average 
of the two closest measurements was calculated as the final value. The online SAS program for 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Growth Charts  (2021)  was applied to calculate 
preschoolers’ BMI  for age and sex . 
 In Year 2, an instrument called the Veggie Meter® was utilized  to assess skin carotenoids 
as an indicator for F/V intake. Biologically, carotenoid levels in serum/plasma have been used as 
a biomarker to estimate F/V intake  (Ferrari et al., 2005) . However, this invasive approach due to 
the drawing of blood can generate needle -related stress, anxiety, insecurity, and fear among 
participants  (Soares da Silva, 2016) . The skin carotenoid score measured by resonance Raman 
spectroscopy (the Veggie Meter®; Longevity Link, Salt Lake City, UT) was proposed as a non -
invasive biomarker for F/V intake given its high correlation ( r=0.70 -0.72) with carotenoid levels 
in blood plasma/serum  (Aguilar et al., 2014; Jahns et al., 2014) . To assess skin carotenoids  in 
this study , each participant’s non -dominant index finger was used, and the average of three scans 
was recorded as the final score.

detail with tables, figures and listings templates will b e developed as a 
separ ate document  
Primar y analysis will be on the endpoint of change in log 10 CFU from  
baseline to pre -surgery using  an analysis of cov ariance ( ANCOVA ) model 
including baseline CFU  as a covar iate. A similar analysis will also be 
performed for the endpoint of ch ange from baseline to the post -surgery 
measurement.  
Secondary efficacy analyses w ill include;  
• Change in log 10 CFU from baseline to  post-surgery using an ANCOVA 
model including  baseline C FU as a covariate.  
• A log 10 AUC for CFUs will als o be undertaken utilis ing data for all 
time points up until the pre -surgery assessment. This analysis o f log 10 
AUC CFUs will also inc luding baseline log 10 CFU as a covariate.  
• A log 10 AUC for CFUs w ill also be  undertaken utilising data for all 
time points u p until the post -surge ry assessment. This  analysis of log 10 
AUC CFUs will also including baseline log 10 CFU as a covariate.  
• Percentag e of patients reach ing a specific reduction in S. aureus  
carriag e prior to surgery, immediately post -surgery and on Day 6 ±  
24hrs.  
• Proportion of patients with nasal  carriage below a set value (value 
TBD)  
• Summary of data for na sal carriage according to SQS along with an 
analy sis of proportional odds.  
• Summary of the prop ortio n of patients with a 2 -log drop (TBD)  
All available da ta from patients in th e Safety Population  will be included in 
the assessment of safety and tolerability . All safety and tolerability data will 
be listed  and summarised by treatment group using appr opria te des criptive 
statistics. Formal statistical comparis ons between the differ ent treatment

CONFIDENTIAL   19 4 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  
Staphyl ococc us aureus  (S. aureus ) and sp eciall y the more antibioti c resistant strain, Methicillin -
Resistant S. aur eus (MRSA ), is a common cau sative organism of noso comial infections in 
hospital s across the world8. It was estimated tha t 1% of all hospitalized pati ents in the United 
States (US) su ffered  from S. aureus  infections, equating to nearly 400,000 patients19, at an 
estima ted cost of $14. 5 billion. Amongst noso comial infections caused by S. aureus  (including 
MRSA) , Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) are a major  infectious entity and are a caus e of 
significant morbidity  and mortality22,23. The prevalence of MRSA noso comi al infe ctions in the 
US ranges from 42.6% to 5 2.0% depending of the site of  the nosocomial infe ction23. The most 
recent data from the National He althc are Safety Network (NHSN) in  the U S showed that despit e 
recent efforts, 42 .6% of all reported S. aureu s surgical site infections were due to MRSA23. At 
least 80% of such infections are caused by the pa tients’ own bacteria9-11. S. aureus  can colonize 
severa l body sites - nose, axillae , groi n and throat - altho ugh the anterior nar es are the preferred 
ecologi c niche and  are identified as the most frequent si te of carriage11-13, with 25 to 35%14 of the 
popu lation being colonize d at any given time. S. aureu s carriers are at a higher risk o f 
staphylococcal infection s after invasive med ical or surgical procedures than non-carriers, having 
been estimated to be 2 t o 10 times more likely to dev elop surgical -site/i ntravenous catheter 
infections15-18. Specifically,  S. aureus  nasal carriage has bee n iden tified as a risk fac tor for the 
developm ent of infections in orthopa edic, thora cic and general surgery as summarized i n a 
review by Wertheim et al  (2005)11. 
Standard i nfection control meas ures, including hand -washing by st aff with antiseptic detergen ts 
or 70% alcohol, ward cl eaning, disinfecting  equipment, correct handling  of clinica l waste, etc are 
important for limiting  MRSA cross -infection. Howeve r, body decolonizati on procedures 
(typica lly nasal decolonization and addit ional body washes) have been  adopt ed or recommended 
for at-risk patients i n many settings25. 
In 2010, Bode  et al reported the res ults of a randomized, d ouble -blind, placebo -controll ed study 
investigati ng nasal and body dec olonization and concluded tha t hos pital-acquired infections wi th 
S. aureus could be prev ented by initiating decolonization treatment (na sal and bod y) 
immediately a fter admission of surgi cal patients20. In a commenta ry on this study, Be rtrand et al 
also con cluded that pre -emptive S. aureus decolonization should be use d in s urgery with a high 
risk of S. aureus  infection such as open -heart su rgery and o rthopaedic or ne urosurgical implant 
procedures9. In their review of published data on de colonization therapy from 2008 to 2010, 
Hebert and  Robi csek concluded that decoloni zation  therapy was likely to be an effective t ool for 
reducing surgical in fection in cardiac and orth opaedic patients21. Kim  et al  have reported a study 
in 7,019 orthopaedic  surgical patients, c oncluding that a program of i denti fication and 
eradication of both M RSA and methicillin -sensitive S. aureus  (MSSA) carriage with intrana sal 
mupiroc in and chlorhexi dine showers can lead t o significant reductions in p ost-operative rates of 
surgical site infe ction5. 
In February 2013, a c onsen sus involving the Surgical I nfecti on Society (SIS), In fectious Disease 
Society of America (IDSA) and T he Society for Healthcare E pidemiology for America  (SHEA), 
published guidelines  which recommend the  use of nasal decolon ization of all S. aureus  in 
cardio vascular and orthopaedic sur gery26. They also discusse d the risks in other  clean surgeries 
where there  was not th e level of proof  to make a formal recom mendation yet. As the only 
Destiny Pharma plc  Clinical Protocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07  
CONFIDENTIAL   20 approved agent for nas al decolonization, mu pirocin is cited, with caveat s ove r widespread use, 
compliance  and a wareness of potentia l resistance. The SI S guidelines26 are likely to  increase t he 
number of cen tres employing S. aureu s decolonization in the surge ries identified, but  this may be 
affected  by the limitations of mupiro cin in respect of treatment durat ion, c ompliance, concerns 
over resistance and logistical difficulties asso ciated with  pre-admission s creening.  
Despite these  recommendations , existing pr oduct approvals do n ot explicitly exempli fy the use 
of prophylactic in trana sal (IN) antibiotics by surg ical p atients . In the US , Mupirocin 
(Bactroban®) is indicated for MRSA dec olonization  during institut ional outbreaks; in Eur ope the 
indication is worded:  ‘the elimination of  nasal carriage of st aphylococci, including MRSA’ . In 
fact, S. aureus  nasal decolon isatio n is not universally  accepted practice a nd if practiced it is not 
done in a sta ndard manner, bu t with a variety of pro ducts and dosing regimens for  each product  
as non e of these are approv ed for the intended indicatio n. 
Exeporfinium chloride (XF -73) is a d icationic porphyrin derivative having po tent bactericidal 
properties  with a nov el mode of actio n. XF-73 is being devel oped as a viscous dermal gel for the 
decolonizati on of S. aureus  in the anterior nares (nasal cavit y) to prevent post -operative 
staphyloco ccal infections.  
XF-73 has been investi gated against a panel of 101  Gram-posit ive and Gram -negative organisms 
selecte d for susceptibility and cros s-resistance testing2. The panel comprise d 65 Gram -positive 
isolates ( 56 ae robic and 9 anaerobic) and 3 6 Gram -negative isolates ( 31 aerobic and 
5 anaerobic).  XF-73 demonstrated excellent b actericidal acti vity against all Gram -positive strains 
tested regard less of species, phe notype or genotype, w ith minimum inhibitory concen trations 
(MICs ) of 0.25 to 4 mg/L . The antibacterial activi ty against Gram -nega tive species was lower, 
with MIC s of 1 mg/L to >  64 mg/L. The study indicated that XF -73 is rapidly bacteri cidal 
against S. aureus, including methic illin-resistant strains (incl uding  USA300) 2 (Study R14 ). 
Expo sure o f bacteria to XF -73 result ed in an obser ved loss of membrane potenti al within 
1 minute, followe d by efflux of small mo lecular weight molecules, ATP  and potassium; 
>99.99% of S. aureus  are killed within 5 minutes1. The  mode  of action is thus focused o n the 
bacterial cell membr ane. Cell death is n ot accompanied by lysis of t he cells, a s observed by 
electron microscopy (Stud y R39) or resulting in efflux  of large molecular weight components 
(DNA, RNA, proteins) 1. 
A multis tep study, in which MRSA was pass aged 5 5 times, showed that  XF-73 had a very lo w 
potential for inducing res istance ove r the 55 passage s. The MIC values showe d no more than a 
4-fold incre ase over the startin g MIC and the accepte d threshold for resistance (≥  8-fold increase 
in MIC) was not reache d3.  
The speed of on set of anti -staphylococcal activity of XF -73 has  also been observed during 
clinical studies, in which the level of S. aureus  isolated from heavily colonized, stable S. aureus 
carriers was observed to be reduced dramatically after 1 to 3  doses over 1  day. T hese 
characteristics have supported the targetin g of a preferred indication of IN administration to 
prevent post -operative  staph ylococcal infections. In this setting, t he rapidity of action  will allow 
for a short treatment course around  surgery .  
To date t here have been 7 completed clinical studies on X F-73 (5 intran asal and 2 dermal ) in 263 
patient s, of which 2 41 received X F-73. In the intranasal (i.n.) studies c arried wi thout 
photodymanic therapy, the most common (≥10%) adverse events (AEs) reported with XF -73 gel 
application are headache ( 11.4%), nasal discomfort (9.0%), and rhinorrhoea  (7.8%). Most  of the 
Destiny Pharma plc  Clinical Protocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07  
CONFIDENTIAL   21 treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) associate d with nasal gel applicat ion from previous studies 
were considered mild to  moderate in intensity . Further details can be found in the  current version 
of Investigator's Brochure  (IB), which cont ains comprehensive in format ion on the investigational 
product.  
This is a proof -of-concep t study which will assess the efficacy and safety  of XF -73 in the 
decolonisation of nasal carriers of S. aureus  that will undergo a surgical procedure associated 
with r isk of post -operative  staph ylococcal infections.  
4.2 Rationale  
XF-73 provided as a 2  mg/g n asal gel with  is being 
developed for the prevention of post -operative  staphylococcal infections. Both microbiological 
and clinical data  support the move of XF-73 into this Phase 2 proof -of-concept study  to assess 
the safety  and microbiological efficacy of XF -73 in reducin g the burden of nasal S. aureus  before 
surgery in patients who are undergoing procedures at risk of post -operative  staphylococcal 
infection,  the p opulation for which XF -73 is intended .  
XF-73 possesses anti -bacterial activity in vitro in the 0.5 to 1 mg/L  concentration range,  against 
S. aureus  colonies, including MRSA , as well as for other potentially pathogenic Staphyloco cci 
spp. This antibac terial  activity is rapid and suggests that a s hort duration of trea tment e.g., 24 to 
48 hours will be possible , prom oting compliance with the treatment .  
Two Phase 1 studies in human volunteers , who were confirmed nasal carriers of S. aureus , have 
already assess ed the safety of XF -73 2 mg/g nasal gel and preliminary efficacy in  reducing the 
burden of S. aureus  in the no se: study XF-73B03 study  with 63 healthy volunteers and study 
DMID11 -007 with 56 healthy volunteers . These studies have  used different regim ens 
concentrations of XF -73 (0.5 mg/g and 2 mg /g) in different regi mens (from 1 IN application 
every 12  hours for 2 days to 1 IN application every 8 hours for 1 day and then every 12  hours for 
another 4 days) and have analysed  efficacy  (burden of nasal S. aureus ) in various ways 
(percentage of patient s deco lonized, evolut ion of quantitative S. aureus  scores and area und er the 
curve of quantitative S. aureus  scores). Although limited in volunteers’  numbers, both studies 
have shown consis tent better responses  for the XF -73 2mg/g nasal gel compared to pla cebo. 
These studies h ave also allowed to assess the dynamics of nasal burden of S. aureus  when 
exposed to XF -73 and inform a dose selection for further development and last but not least, 
these studies have dep icted a favourable safety and tolerability pro file for XF -73. XF -73 has also 
been assessed for safety up to 5.0  mg/g  aqueous solution applied to the shoulder in healthy 
volunteers. These data suggest that XF -73 may also reduce the burd en of S. aureus , incl uding 
MRSA, before surgery in pat ients at risk  of post-operative  staphylococcal infections.   
In summary, the data f rom previous studies warrant the move of XF -73 into a further step in its 
development for the prevention of post -operat ive staphylococcal in fectio ns with this Phase 2 
proof -of-concept st udy wh ere the safety and efficacy of XF -73 to decrease the burden of n asal 
carriage of S. aureus  will be studied in actual patients who will undergo a procedure at risk of 
post-operative  staphylococcal infectio ns. Please refer to the current IB for further  information.  
4.3 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The safety of nasal application of XF -73 in concentrations up to 2 mg/g , cumulative doses up to 
13.2 mg and for up to 5 days has alr eady been studied i n 172 volunteers. The  most common AEs 
reported as related to X F-73 ha ve been nasal disco mfort , headache  and rhinorrhoea in 17, 14 and 

Destiny Pharma plc  Clinical Protocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07  
CONFIDENTIAL   22 14 patients , respectively . These events were mostly mild in intensity , transient  and resolved 
spontaneously without sequelae . Post-dose nasal examinations  have not revealed erythema o r 
increased secretions , so these events seem to be more related with the physical presen ce and 
sensation of the gel in the nares rather than a physiological interaction with the nasal mucosa; 
though a dose r esponse cannot be fully ruled out.  
Only one susp ected unexpe cted serio us adverse reaction (SUSAR), hyposmia, has been reported ; 
and has also been the only related serious adverse event so far. This was in study DMID11 -007 
and since this report the remaini ng 21 volunteers wer e provided a smell test pre - and post - study. 
No si gnal was detected.  
XF-73 plasma levels have been determined in all  studies up to date showing no evidence of 
systemic absorption (assay detection limit 0.2 ng/mL), therefore no systemic  toxicity from XF -73 
is expected in this study. O f note, in the studies  with XF-73 nasal gel  to date , there have been no 
AEs leading to t reatment or study discontinuation.  
XF-73 provided as a nasal gel has been shown to be well tolerated in different heal thy volunteer 
studie s; nevertheless in this Phase 2 study, wi th patient s who will undergo surgery, besides the 
usual safety exams (physic al, biochemistry and haematological laboratory tests) a nasal 
examination by an ear nose and throat (ENT) specialist wi ll be performed pre and post-dosing to 
further as sess the risks from the contact of XF -73 gel  and the nasal mucosa as well as a pre -post-
dosing smell test to address the possible risk of hyposmia as it was seen in study DMID11 -007. 
An independent data moni toring committee ( IDMC) of experts will be set up  which will 
regularly review the safety information from the study as well as the incid ence of post -operative  
staphylococcal infections. Should these reach an unexpectedly high level, the IDMC can 
recommend  stopping the study . The IDMC charter containing am ongst others  membershi p, 
meetings frequency, structure and procedures produced before randomization of the first patient  
will be updated implem enting the ch anges introduced  in this version  2.1 of the protocol . 
A benefit cannot be guaranteed , given the early stage of deve lopment if XF-73, however it is 
expe cted that the reduction in na sal burden o f S. aureu s seen in the healthy volunteers will 
reproduce in patients who p articipate in this study , which may translate in a reduction in the risk 
of developing post -operative  staphylococca l infections. This benefi t will be difficult to 
apprec iate in this  study as the incidence of these infections is low and the number patients to 
enrol very limited.  
In summary, even though a benefit cannot be guaranteed or measured, only expected ; the risks  
are limited . Additionall y, surveillance measures  to reassess bene fit-risk d uring the execution of 
the study such as the nasal examination sm ell test  and an IDMC  are in place; so that appropriate 
action can be taken should an unexpected signal a rise. The r isk-benefit assessment is  therefore 
thought to be favo urable in th is study.

6.1 Overview  
This is a Phase 2, multi -centre, randomized,  double -blind, parallel, placebo -controlled study of 
multiple application s of a sing le concentration of XF -73 nasal gel to assess the  microbiological  
effect of XF-73 on commensal S. aureus  nasal carriage in patients schedule d for surgical 
procedures deemed to be at high risk of post -operative  S. aureus  infection . The study is d ivided 
in 4 periods: screening ( Days -14 to -1) randomization ( Days -10 to -1), treatme nt (Days -1 and 
0) and follow -up (post-last study dose  to Day 30 or Day 90 if an implant is inserted during 
surgery). Day 0 is the calendar day in which surgery takes pl ace. Only patients who test posit ive 
to S. aureus  by a standardized  rapid diagno stic test wi ll be enrolled in the study . Approximately 
125 patient s will be randomised in a double -blind manner (the investigator s and patient s are 
blind to the treatment assig nment) in a 1:1 ratio to 0.2% w/w XF-73 nasal gel treatment  OR 
placebo to match XF-73 nasal gel. 
The study drug, 0.2% w/w XF-73, or matched placebo will be administered 4 times into each 
nostril over 24 hours prior to surgery and then a single application immediately  upon closure of  
surgical wound . Additionally, patient s may undergo c hlorhexidine  skin decolonisation ah ead of 
surgery  and receive peri operative prophylactic systemic antibiotics in accordance with local 
practice . 
In total 7 n asal swabs will be taken: at screening, 3 times prior to surg ery (surgery within 
1 hour), post -surgery (right after surgical wound clo sure) , 48 hours post-surgery  and 7 days post-
surgery .  
Efficacy will be assessed by  S. aureus  colonisation from screening to 7 days after sur gery as wel l 
as by incidence o f post-opera tive staphylococcal infections and use  of anti-staphylococcal 
antibiotics  post-surgery . Safety will be assessed by reported AEs  from screening up to Day 6 as 
well as  vital signs, physical examination  (ENT) , clinica l laborator y assessments (haem atology, 
clinical chemistry, and urinalysis)  and Brief-Smell I dentification Tests  (B-SIT) at different time 
points as reflected in Table  1.1. 
The maximum study duration will be up to 45 or 105 da ys for eac h individ ual (fr om sc reening to 
post-study follow -up visit) depen ding on whether a  foreign implant was inserted during surgery.  
An IDMC will be set up w hich will review the safety i nformation from the study  and the 
incidence of post -operative  staphylococcal infections . Based on the findings from these 
activities , the IDMC can recommend ; 
• Stop the study in case of s erious concerns on subje ct’s safety.   
• Stop the study due to the incidence of post -operative staphyloco ccal infe ctions.  
• Cont inue as cur rently described in the protocol  
• Continue the study with protocol modif ications.

CONFIDENT IAL  27 6.2 Discussion  of Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, randomised, double -blind, parallel, placebo -controlled, study of a 
single concen tration of XF -73 nasal gel conducted in  surgical patient s who are at risk of 
post-operative  staphylococcal  infec tions. Patients will be randomised in a double -blind 
manner to either the active or placebo arm on a 1:1 basis.  
6.2.1 Rationale for the Dosage of XF -73 
The dosing regimen to be ass essed in this study, four 0. 3 mL applicat ions in each naris of 
a 2 mg/g XF -73  nasal  gel 24 hours  before surgery and a 5th application right 
after surgery (a cumulative dose of 6 mg of XF -73), is supported by microbiolog ical and 
clinical data from XF -73 Phase 1 studies. Microbi ological data  showed that XF -73 has a 
rapid antibacter ial acti vity and sugg ests that a short duration of treatment may be 
possible, facilitating compliance with this treatment.  
In study XF -73B03, 6 3 healthy volunteers (safety p opulation ) who were nasal pe rsistent 
carriers of  S. aureus  were randomly assigned to recei ve X F-73 nasa l gel (0.5 mg/gr) or 
XF-73 nasal gel (2.0 mg/gr), both with , or placebo in each naris every 12  hours 
for 2 days; 27,  12 and 24 volunteers per grou p respect ively. Burden of  S. aureus  in the 
naris was measured as semiquantitative  S. aureu s scores duri ng the 2-day treatment 
period and up to discharge ( Day 4) and follow -up (up to Day 6).  
The efficacy data for the treatment  period showed consistent bett er respon ses for the 
2 XF-73 groups than for placebo in different efficacy measure s: eradi cation rates of 
S. aureus  from participants’ noses; semiquantitative  S. aureus  scores; time to first 
clearance and mean differences in A UC. In many instances these di fferences  were 
statistically  significant in favour of XF -73. In the efficacy data at disch arge (Day 4),  on 
the other hand, only the AUC analysis showed statistically significant differences in 
favour of XF -73 groups for the di scharge . No differences betwee n study g roups were 
detected  during the f ollow -up period (Days 7 and 14). XF -73 wa s well t olerated at a ll 
dose levels used in this study.  
Results for eradication of  S. aureus  during the treatment period (i.e. , after 2 doses t o each 
naris in the first 24 -hour perio d and after 4 doses  to each nari s in the first 48 -hour period ), 
are descr ibed in the Table 6.1 below. In summary, for the XF -73 2.0 mg/g group there 
was a 41.7% (10 out of 24,  P = 0.0087) clearance of  S. aureus  carriage at 24 hours a fter 
2 doses (total dose 2.4 mg of XF -73) and a 37.5% (9 out o f 24, P = 0.0965) clearance of  
S. aureus  carriage at 48 hours after 4 doses (total dose 4.8 mg of XF -73) over placebo. 
For the XF -73 0.5  mg/g  group the was a 33 .3% (4 out  of 12, P = 0.0804 ) 
clearance o f S. aureus  carriage at 24 hours after 2 doses (t otal dose 0.6  mg of XF -73) and 
a 50% (6  out of 16, P = 0.0455) clearance of  S. aureus  carriage at 48 hours after 4 doses 
(total dose 1.2  mg of XF -73) over placebo.

In addition, the analysis of semi -quantitativ e S. aureus  scores during the treatment period 
also showed a more marked decrease from baseline in the 2 XF-73 treatment groups than 
in the placebo group. This same d ifference was shown in the a nalysis of me an differences 
in AUC during the treatmen t period  and it was s tatistically significant with better 
responses for the XF-73 groups. Moreover, statistical AUC analysis and the change fro m 
baseline in the reduction in  S. aureus  semi-quantitative  scores there was an apparent dose 
response relationsh ip with t he higher 2.0  mg/g XF -73 dosage performing better than the 
0.5 mg/g dosage.  
In conclusion , these data from the study suggest that the h ighest concentration of XF -73 
(i.e., 2.0  mg/g) should be u sed to get a m aximum response and that an efficient do se 
should  be provided right before the point of highest risk for development of post -
operative  infections (i.e. , right before surgery).  
In the h ealthy volunteer study DMID11 -007, 52 hea lthy volunteers ( safety populat ion) 
who were nasal persistent carriers of S. aureus received XF-73 nasal gel (0.5 mg/gr)  
 or XF -73 nasal gel (2.0 mg/gr)  or XF -73 nasal gel (0.5 mg/gr)  or 
placebo in each naris every 8  hours on Day 1 and every 12 hours Days 2 to 5; thi s 
provided cumulative doses of XF -73 of 3.3 mg, 1 3.2 mg and 3. 3 mg respectively. 
Thirteen volunteers were randomly assigned to each group. Burden of  S. aureus  in the 
naris was measured  as semiquantitative  S. aureus  scores dur ing the 5-day tre atment 
period and up to discharge (up to Day 6).  
The efficacy data for the treatment period supported the conclusions from study 
XF73 -B03. Early in treatment there were important differences in the  number of 
volunteers achievin g eradicati on of S. aureus  from their nose  between placebo and XF -73

CONFIDENT IAL  30 • There is no approved drug for S. aureus  nasal decolonization  to prevent post -
operative  staphylococcal  infections, the indication  under study  
• Studies of nasal decolonisation  of S. aureus show a s ignificant variability in the 
microbiological measurements and an important placebo effect (up to 50%-60%) 
which supports the need for a placeb o to appr opriately a ssess the effect of XF -73.  
• S. aureus  nasal decolonisation prior to sur gery is n ot universall y accepted  practice 
and when practiced it is not done in a standard way, but with considerable 
variation in the products a nd dosing regimens us ed of eac h product ; as these 
products  are not appro ved for the intended indication.   
• The st udy’s pri mary  endpoint  is based on microbiological data, not clinical. No 
impact is expected on post -operative staphylococcal infections from th e use of 
placebo as t heir inci dence is lo w and the sample size not enoug h to detect it.

7.3.1 Reasons for Withdrawal  
Participation is strictl y voluntary. Patient s must  be withdrawn from the study for any of 
the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent;  
• Pregnancy ; 
• Investigator’s opinion that it is in the  best interests  of the patient; 
• Patient  is not willing or a ble to comply with study requirements  
If a patient  withdraws from a trial prematurely, t he Investigator must dete rmine the 
primary reason for this and reco rd it in the electronic case report form ( eCRF). For 
patients who are  lost to follow up, the Investig ator should show due dili gence by 
documenting in th e source documents steps taken to con tact the patient . 
7.3.2 Replace ment of Patient s 
Patient s who withdraw or who are prematurely withdrawn from the stu dy having recei ved 
study me dication will not be replaced bu t will be  followed -up for  safety as far as practica l 
for inclusion into the safety datas et. 
7.4 Patient  Identificatio n and Randomization  
At screening, each pat ient will be given a unique 5 -digit number  to facilitate anonymous 
identification within the study. T he first 2 digits of the number is the centre numbe r (i.e., 
Destiny Pharma pl c Clinical Pr otocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07 
CONFIDENT IAL  33 01, 02, etc.). The following  3 digits will be enrolme nt order number (i.e., first patient at 
centre number 01 is number 01 -001 then 01 -002, etc). Once a ssigned to a  patient, a 
patient number will no t be re -used. This numb er will be used throughout t he study as the 
subject identifier.  
A randomisation schedule  will be prepared by an independent statis tician and provided to 
Interactive Respons e Technology  System (IRT) personnel prior  to commencement of the 
study. This list wi ll be maintained in the IRT system, under restricted access,  until after 
study unblindin g occurs.  Patient s will be randomly alloca ted in a 1:1 ratio as follows: 
0.2% w/w XF-73 nasal gel treatment  OR placebo to match XF -73 nasal gel treatment . 
At randomisat ion, the IRT will assign an investigational product ( IP) pack n umber. The 
pharmacist or qualified designee will retrieve the appro priate cardboard carton with the 
correspon ding number. If a second bo ttle is needed, e.g. because syrin ge time to use has 
exceeded 48 hours from preparati on, the pharmacist or qualified des ignee will use the 
IRT sy stem to ascertain the second IP pack numbe r required for the subject. Detailed 
instructions will be  provided in  the Pharmacy and IRT Manual s. 
7.5 Stopping and Discontinuati on 
An IDMC will b e set up which will review the safety informat ion from t he study as well 
as the incidence of post -operative staphyloco ccal infections. Shoul d these reach an 
unexpecte dly high level, the IDMC can recommend stopping the study, the decision w ill 
be communicat ed to the sponsor as well as  investigator site s, compete nt authorities , and 
ethics committees/IRBs . The IDMC charter  containing, amongst othe r things , 
membership , meet ings frequency, stopping criteria, stru cture and procedures  produced 
before random ization of the first patient  will be updated implem enting the ch anges

CONFIDENT IAL  37 on the IRT assignment . The pharmacist  or qualif ied designee  is responsible for 
maintaining accurate study drug accountability rec ords throughout the study.  
Each  dispensing of study  drug will b e documented in the Pharmacy File and the time of 
administration should be captured in the eCRF . Any unused  prepared syring es will be 
kept in their zip-lock foil bag at pharmacy for accountabil ity and reconciliation.  
The stu dy drug records must  be availabl e for inspection by the Sponsor’s representative 
and is subject  to inspe ction by a regulatory agency at any tim e. Copies of  the records will 
be provided to the Sponsor at the end of the study. A Clinical Research Associate ( CRA)  
will review the  study drug records. Any remaining study drug will be either returned to 
the Sponsor  or destroyed at site in accordance wit h the site’s  Standard Operating 
Procedures following final accountability by the CRA. 
8.6 Compliance  
Patient s will be  considered complian t if they re ceive the 5 scheduled applications ( 4 prior 
to surgery and 1 after surge ry) of randomized study drug . 
8.7 Concomita nt Medicatio ns 
Any medication the patient  takes other than the study drug is consi dered a concomitant 
medication.  All concomitant med ications mus t be recorded in the eCRF. The following 
information must be recorded in  the eCRF for each concomitant medicati on: generic 
name , route of administration, start date, stop date, dosage, and indi cation. Any changes 
in the dosa ge or regimen of a c onco mitant m edication must be recorded in the eCRF.  
At randomization , patient s will be asked what medications they have tak en during th e last 
30 days. Changes to concomitant medications will be captured th roughout the study and 
follow -up periods.  
The use o f intra-nasal antibiotics or anti -infectives other than the study mediation prior to  
surgery is not allowed.  
8.8 Treatment of O verdose

CONFIDENT IAL  38 9 PARAMETERS AND ME THODS  OF A SSESSMENT  
9.1 Microbiolog ical Assessments  
9.1.1 Screening 
Poten tially suitable patient s who provide written informed consent to nasal s wabbing and 
microbiological analysis wi ll be assess ed for nasal  S. aureus  carriage.  
Specimens for detection of  S. aureus  will be collected using commerc ial nasal swabs. 
Each specimen w ill be collected from the anterior naris, and the swab will be immersed 
in the accompanying transport medium co ntainer for transfer to the microbiological 
laboratory. PCR will be used for the rapid detection and identificati on of  S. aureus  at 
screening. The swab will be processed by a standardi zed laboratory  process  using a n 
FDA -cleared  commercial rapid diagnostic test, the  
 to confi rm S. aureus  and identi fy whether it is MSSA or 
MRSA. This tes t will confirm presence or absence of MSSA or MRSA in nasal swab and 
will be used for inclusion in the study.  
Only subjects who are  S. aureus positive by the rapid diagnostic te st (and meeting other 
criteria) will be  enrolled to th e study .  
9.1.2 Treatment and Follow -up Periods   
Patient s who test positive for  S. aureus  at screening and provide c onsent for the main 
study will have nasal swabs tak en at the following times  
1. Prior to Dose 1  (22 hours ( ± 2 hours) prio r to surgery ; quant itative).  
2. Prior to Dose 3 ( 6 hours (± 2 hou rs) prio r to surgery ; quantitative)  
3. Prior to Dose 4 ( Up to 1 hour  prior to incis ion; quantitative)  
4. Prior to Dose 5 ( Up to 1 hour  post wound closure; quantitativ e) 
5. 48 ho urs (±  24 hours ) after surgery (quantitative)  
6. 6 days (±  24 hours ) after surger y (quantitative)  
 
Swabs will be transferred to the microbiological laboratory and standard microbiology 
culture techniques will be used to quantify the number of bacteria  in CFU/ mL at each 
timepoint.  
In order  to appropriat ely assess the incidenc e of post-operative staphylococcal infections 
investigators will take all reasonable efforts to obtain microbiological  documentation and 
a bacterial isolate when the suspicion of p ost-operative infection  is raised. This  includes 
but is not limited to the c ollection and culture of exudates, blood, implant or other 
specimens according to the suspected site of infection. Iso lates of Staphylococcus spp. 
obtained from these cultures will  be kept  for further an alysis and chara cterization  (e.g., 
genotypic and phen otypic cha racterization) . 
These samples as well as those bacterial isolates obtained from the nasal swabs during the 
study will kept for up to 10 years after the completion of the study for further pheno typic 

Destiny Pharma pl c Clinical Pr otocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07 
CONFIDENT IAL  39 and genoty pic analysis a nd characterization.  The details of these tests are not known at 
this time. No subject identifying information will be retained for these sam ples. The 
Informed Consent Form explains the storage and futur e use of  specimens and subjects 
will be  asked to cons ent for future testing of samples . 
The Sponsor and Sponsor contracted vendors will have access to the samples and will 
perform microbiologica l work on behalf of the sponsor. Additionally, bacterial isola tes 
may be shared with academic researc hers.  
As these  are bacterial samples,  no human genetic testing will be performed.  
9.1.3 Microbiological Specimen Collection and Culture for  S. aureus  
The Laborat ory Manual  of Microbial Procedures will describe the details of collec tion 
and proces sing met hods for  microbiological samples, including t ype of nas al swab and 
transport tube, microbiological culture methods, and reporting of results.  
9.2 Efficacy Parameters  
Efficacy will be assessed by measuring C FUs/mL at the time points outli ned in the 
Sche dule of Assessme nts (Table  1.1) the incidence of post -operative staphylococcal 
infections  as well as use of post -operative  anti-staphylococcal antibiotics . 
Any staphylo coccal post -operative  infections arising betwe en study  treatme nt and up to 
30 or 90  days (if foreig n implant)  included but not limited to SSI, bloodstream infections, 
catheter -related infections, and implant infectio ns are to be captured as events indicati ng 
lack of efficacy. T hese should NOT be captu red as s afety TE AEs.  
9.3 Safety Parameters  
Safety will be  assessed by incidence of AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, 
physical examinations , nasal examination,  and the B-SIT. 
9.3.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs, whether identified by the Investigator or the study patient from screening to 
Day 6, will be record ed in the eCRF. Measurement of vital signs and clinical laboratory 
parameters will be performed pre - and post -study  and clinically significant values will be  
capture d as AEs . For AEs occurring  after D ay 6, see section 9 .3.1.2  of this pr otocol . 
9.3.1.1  Definitions  
Per ICH, a n AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a pat ient or clinical 
investigation patient  administe red a pharmaceutical product and which d oes not 
necessarily ha ve a causal relationship  with th is treat ment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavourable o r uninte nded sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding ), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated wit h the use of a medicinal (investigationa l) product, 
whether or  not related to the medi cinal (i nvestiga tional) product. The AE may be any of 
the follo wing : 
• A new illness  
Destiny Pharma pl c Clinical Pr otocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07 
CONFIDENT IAL  40 • An exacerbation of a sign or symptom or  the underlying condition or of a 
conc omitant il lness under treatment  
• Unrelated to parti cipation in the clinic al study or an effect of  the stu dy medic ation 
or comparator drug  
• A combination of 1 or more of the above factors  
No causal relationship with the s tudy medication is implied by the use of the ter m AE. 
Planned or elective surgical or in vasive procedures for pre-existing conditions that hav e 
not wo rsened are not AEs. However, any complication t hat occu rs during a planned or 
elective surgery is an AE. C onditions leading to unplanned surgical procedur es may be 
AEs.  
When an AE occurs after written consent has be en obtained but before t he first  dose of  
study drug, the AE will be considered a non -treatment emergent AE. An AE that occurs 
from the time the patient receives his/her first dose of study drug until his/her last study 
visit will be c onsidered a TEAE regar dless of the assessed re lationsh ip to th e 
administration of the study drug . 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  (Note : the term “life -threatening” refers to any AE that, as it 
occurs, puts the patient at  immedia te risk of death. It does not refer to an AE that 
hypot heticall y might have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Requ ires hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization  (not including 
hosp italization for a pre -existing condition that has not increase d in severity or 
frequency from the patient’s u nderlyin g medical condition prior to entry into the 
study) . Hospitalization for an elective procedure, or r outinely scheduled treatment for 
a pre -existing condition that  has not worsened, is no t an SAE . 
• Result s in persistent or significant disability or in capacity  
• Is a con genital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is another  medically important condition  
 
An important me dical event that is not immediately life  threatening or will r esult in death 
or hospit alizatio n, but w hich may jeopardize the patient  or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed abov e, should be reported as “serious” 
as well.  
Medi cal and scientific judgment should b e exercised in decidin g whether a case is 
serious. 
“Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the patient  is receivi ng study drug at the time 
of the event.  
Destiny Pharma pl c Clinical Pr otocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07 
CONFIDENT IAL  41 Severity o f Adverse Event:  
Refers to the extent to which an A E affects the patient 's daily activi ties. Severity will be  
categorized accor ding t o the fo llowing criteria:  
Mild:  The AE does not interfere with the patient’s routine activities.  
Moderate:  The AE interfe res with the patient ’s daily routine, but usual routine 
activities can still be carried out. 
Severe:  The AE r esults in the inability to perfo rm routi ne activities.  
The term "severity" is used to describe  the intensity of an event. This is not the same as  
"serious". Seriousness, not severity, serves as  the guide for defining regulatory repor ting 
obligations. The highest severity grade a ttained should b e reported, for AEs with 
divergent severities.  
Causalit y of Adverse Event:  
Refers to the relationship of the AE to study drug. Causality will be reported  according to 
the following criteria:  
Not 
related:  Adverse eve nts for which a reasonab le expla nation f or an alternative cause 
is considered plausible , e.g., no study drug taken, plausible clinical 
alternative  like accidental injury, expected progression of  underlying or 
concomitant disease, phar macologically incompat ible temporal relationsh ip, 
or intercurr ent illness.  
Related:  Adverse events for which  a reaso nably possible clinical and/or 
pharmacological rela tionship to study drug cannot be excluded, e.g.,  lacking 
plausible alternatives.  
 
9.3.1.2  Recor ding Adverse Events  
Patient  Enrolment to the F irst Adm inistrat ion of Study Drug: Non-treatment 
emergent AEs w ill be r ecorded from the time when the patient  is enrolled into the study 
(date of signature of the screeni ng informed consent)  until first adminis tration of study 
drug.  These events will be re corded i n the me dical history section of the eCRF . 
First Admini stration  of Study Drug to Patient 's Day 6 visit: Thereafter , all AEs are 
TEAEs and will be recorded until Day 6 visit has been performed.   
After Day 6: Only AEs that mee t SAE criteria and are c onsidere d relate d with the study 
medication by the investigator  will be  recorded after Day 6 through the final follow up 
visit. 
If an AE (serious or not) started during t he study but did not end before the fina l 
follow -up visit, the  Investigator should mak e a reas onable e ffort to establish the outcome 
and the end date . If thi s is not possible, the outcome recorded at the fina l follow-up visit 
will be assumed to be the fina l outcome.  
If an event stops and later r estarts, all the occur rences must be reported.  If in a patient  the 
same event changes in intensity over time  (e.g., diarrhoea  starting as mild turns into 
Destiny Pharma pl c Clinical Pr otocol  v2.1 
XF-73B07 
CONFIDENT IAL  42 severe) , only the most severe intensity will be recorded.  All AEs assessed as rela ted to 
study medicat ion by the I nvestigato r and all SAEs must be f ollowed up until  resolution.  
(e.g., value back to baseline valu e) or st abilization or until final database lock.  
Signs/sym ptom s should be documented if a definite diagnos is cannot be established. The 
Investigat or should attempt to e stablish a diagnosis of the even t based on signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical inform ation. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as  the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/ symp toms. If a diagnosis 
is accompanied by unusual symptoms, both the diagnosis itself  and the  symptom s will be 
reported . 
After Patient's Last Study Visit : The Investigator records and forwards to the Sponsor  
all SAEs that she or he becomes aware of and sh e or he considers related to the study 
drug. 
Laboratory values  that are outside the no rmal ran ge and considered clinically 
relevant in the opinion of  the Investigator are also defined as AEs.  
If abnormal labo ratory values are signs of an AE (e.g., an infec tion) that has already been 
recorded, th e respective abnormal laboratory value does no t consti tute a s eparate AE.  
Whe rever reasonable the reporting I nvestiga tor will use the clinical term rather than the 
laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low haemoglobi n value). 
9.3.1.3  Responsibilities of the Invest igator  
The AE  data sho uld be obtained through observat ion of t he patient , from any information 
volunteered by  the patient, or through patient  questioning. The general t ype of question 
asked could be similar to: “Do y ou have any health problems?” or “Have y ou had any 
health prob lems since your last cli nic visi t?” 
All AEs are to be documented/ recorded accurately an d comple tely on the AE pages of the 
respective eCRF and in the patient 's source data.  
All non -treatment an d TEAEs w ill be recorded  through Day 6. 
This is true even if t he study drug was not ad minister ed accor ding to the study protocol.  
For conditions lead ing to u nplanned surgical procedures the underlying conditi on, should 
be documented as an AE, but not the p rocedure. For withdrawals due to AEs  these 
should be captured in the CRF.  If the AE meets the criteria  of an SAE,  it should be 
reported to  as normal . 
Overdose needs to be captured as an AE  in the CRF and reported to  
if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE . 
9.3.1.4  Responsibilities of the  Sponsor  
For purposes of  safety analyses  all AEs will be recorded in the clinical datab ase. To 
ensure expedited and periodic notification of autho rities, SAEs will also be recorded in 
the drug s afety database.

CONFIDENT IAL  44 Patients that have unresolved AEs, clinically r elevan t laboratory parameters o r SAEs  
after Day 6 (including the Early Termination  Visit), shoul d be followed by the 
Investigator until satisfa ctory resolution (e .g., value back to baseline value) or 
stabilizati on or until final database lock. If necessary , in o rder to obtain the additi onal 
information,  the Investigator may request addi tional physica l examinations to be 
completed or additional bl ood or urine samples to be taken.  The assessments meas ured 
will be d etermined by the I nvestigator. All data must be doc umen ted in the eCRF.  
Destiny Pharma’s regulator y advisors  are 
responsible for fulfilling all sponsor obligations regarding notification of the FDA  
according to appl icable regulatory requirements (expedited and  perio dic reporting, e.g., 
SUSA Rs, Development Safety  Update Report). In addition,   will provide 
safety information arising from the authorities of countries other than the US and to  
Investigators acco rding to the current regulations  and ensure t hat the Investigators notify 
their IEC/IRB . 
9.3.2 Pregnancy  
If a female patient  or the f emale partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant during the 
study or 30 days after study completion, the patient  should notify th e Investigator 
immediately , who will report t he eve nt to . The pregnancy will be  
followed until termination or birth of the  baby .  
9.3.3 Laboratory Parameters  
Laboratory refere nces from  certified central laborator ies will be used. All results  of 
laboratory tests will be entered in the stu dy database.  
The tests listed in Table  9.1 will be conducted on samples collected and  analysed by 
standard laboratory procedures at the time points designated on the Schedule of

9.3.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured and recorded at the time points de signated on the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table  1.1). All  measurements will be recorded on the vital signs eCRF. 
Abnormal test results  may be rep eated at the discretion of the I nvestigator and must be 
reported on th e corresponding eCRF. When vital signs and/or b lood sample co llection 
occur at the same time, vita l signs should be performed bef ore blood sample collection.  
9.3.5 Physical Examinat ions 
The I nvestig ator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam ination 
(including nose and nasal passages ) at the Rand omisat ion Visit  (Table  1.1). Pre -dose 
abnormal findings will be reported on th e medical history  eCRF. After that, brief, 
symptom -driven physical examinations ( including nose and nasal passages) will be done . 
Any adverse ch ange from the baseline physic al exa mination at Randomisation Visit  will 
be documented on the AE eCRF  (except tho se occurring prio r to first study medication

Nose and nasa l passage examinations will be conducted by an  ear nos e and th roat  (ENT)  
specialist  at the time points designated on the Schedule of Ass essments (Table  1.1). 
The standard nasal examination wil l consist of evaluati on of both nares and the nasal 
passages for mucosal eryt hema, oedema , and secretions. Note that the test article is a red, 
viscous gel, a nd as such, this should be consi dered  during assess ments. 
9.3.6.2  Brief Smell Identification Test™  
In the study, patient s are required to complete the B-SIT, also known as the Univers ity of

10.1.1  Screening Visit (Day -14 to Day -1) 
Patient s will be asked to sign a screening informe d con sent form  (ICF) prior to 
undergoing nasal swabbing for r apid S. aureus  testin g. Patient s will be given a full 
explanation of the nat ure of t he study and the main study ICF will be provided. As the 
results from the standardi zed  rapid test will take a 
few hours, the patient  will have time to become familiar with the main study  ICF and 
compose  questions if the swa b result  is positive for  S. aureus .  
10.1.2  Randomiz ation Visit (Day -10 to Day -1) 
If the  patient  is tested  S. aureus  positive , the following procedures are to be completed 
(Table  1.1): 
• Obtain consen t for the main study . Patient ’s informed consent to the study will be 
documented before any Rand omization Visit study-speci fic asses sments or 
proce dures are performed . 
• Verify eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criter ia) 
• Record demographic data including sex,  age, race, and ethni city 
• Record medical/surgical histor y (including any risk factors  for S. aureus carriage )

to Day -1 prior to dose 1 ) 
10.1.3  Treatme nt Period (Day s -1 to Day  0) 
Patien ts who meet the entry  criteria will undergo the followin g treatment visits and 
assessments at timepoints designated on the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1.1). All 
assessme nts sho uld be completed prior to the dose of study drug.  Treatm ent visits will 
normally occur in hospital , however  if more conven ient for the patient , home vi sits by 
qualifie d staff  working  to an agreed process will be allowed.  
 
It is normally expected that patients will continue as planned to their pre -determined 
surgery time and date after the initial pre -surgical doses of IMP in the previous 24 hours. 
However, in clinical p ractice surgery can be postponed at any point in the lead up to the 
planned sur gery time and date for different reasons and would not be consider ed a 
protocol deviation. If surgery is delayed, then the following  steps should be followed.  
• If the delay to th e planned incision timepoint is less than or equal to 48 hours, the 
patient sho uld continue with the remaining doses as per protocol to the new 
timeframe. The remaining IMP must be checked to be within its own 4 8hr expiry 
window or replaced with a new kit assigned by the IRT system.  
• If the delay to the planned incision timepoint is greater than 48 hours but the 
patient’s new surgery date and time is still within their screening window, then 
existing IMP should b e replaced and a new kit assigned to the pati ent and full 
dosing regimen provided according to the protocol to the new timef rame. 
• If the delay to the planned incision timepoint is greater th an 48 hours and the 
patient’s new surgery date and time is outside  their screening window, then the 
patient sho uld be withdrawn. If time permits, the patient can be re -screened using 
a new scre ening number .

percentage of patients  receiving concomitant med ication by drug cla ss and preferred drug 
name. A lis ting of all medications w ill be produced  indicating whether the medication 
was taken prior to, during and/or after treatment.  
11.6 Treatment Compl iance  
Treatme nt exposure will be summari sed and listed by treat ment group by means  of 
descriptive statistics for ca tegorical data (counts an d per centages).  The number of doses 
taken (range 1 to 5 ) will be reported for the Safety Population.  
11.7 Efficacy Analys es 
Primary an alysis will be on the endpoint of change in log 10 CFU from baseline t o pre -
surgery using an analysis o f covarian ce (ANCOV A) model including ba seline CFU a s a 
covariate. A similar analysis will also be performed for the endpoint of change from 
baseline to t he post -surgery measurement.   
Secondary efficacy analys es will includ e; 
• Change in log 10 CFU from basel ine to pos t-surgery using  an A NCOVA mode l 
including baseline CFU as a covariate.  
• A log 10 AUC for CFUs will also be undertaken utilising data for all time 
points up until the p re-surgery assessment. This a nalysis of log 10 AUC CFUs 
will also including baseli ne log10 CFU as a covaria te.

will also including basel ine log 10 CFU as a covariate.  
• Percentage of patients  reaching a specific redu ction  in S. aureus carriage  prior 
to surgery, immediately post -surgery and on Day 6  ± 24hrs  
• Proportion of patients w ith nasal car riage below a set value (value to be 
determined [ TBD]) 
• Summary of dat a for nasal carriage according to  SQS along  with an analys is 
of proportio nal odds.  
• Summary of the proportion of patients with a 2 -log drop (TBD)   
In addition to the planned a nalysis in th e PP population which requires patients to receive  
4 doses of pre -surgery treatment, and additional se nsitivity analysis will b e per formed 
which will incl ude all patients who receive 3 doses of pre -surgery treatment . 
Analysis of post -operative  infections a nd antibiotic use at Day30 and Day 90 will be 
performed separately to  the main analysis period of rand omis ation Day 0 to follow -up at 
Day 6  and can be rep orted separately . 
11.8 Safety Analyses  
Safety will be determined by AEs, clinical laboratory p arameters, physical examination , 
vital signs, microbiological s pecimen collection and nasal examination.  
All availa ble data f rom patients in the Safety Pop ulation will  be included in the 
assessment of safety and tolerability. All safety and tolerability da ta will be li sted and 
summari sed by treatment group using appro priate descriptive statistics. Formal statistical 
compar isons between the dif feren t treatmen t groups wil l not be conducted.  
All AEs  will be coded using the MedDRA terminology.  
Further details w ill be provid ed in the SAP.  
11.9 Interim Analyses  
An interim analysi s will be performed , depending on recruitment projec tions, whe n 
approximately  60% evaluable  subjects hav e been recruited. The aims of this interim 
analysis are to:  
• Review the Safety data genera ted to date . 
• Review the incidence of post -operative staphylococ cal infections . 
• Stop the study in case of serious co ncerns on subject’s safet y 
• Stop the stu dy due to the incidence of pos t-operative staphylococcal infections.  
The interim analyses will be perf ormed by  an independent statistician and will be 
performed u sing simil ar methodology to that for th e main analys is. This approach will be 
describ ed in furth er detail in the IDMC SAP.    
All study staff including the Sponsor w ill remain blinded until the en d of the study .

CONFIDENT IAL  55 Full de tails of these analyses and the role of the IDMC wil l be provided in the new 
version of the IDMC charter  implem enting the ch anges introduced  in this version  2.1 of 
the protocol . 
11.10  Dete rmination  of Sample Size  
Indiv idual  CFU data is p resented in the s tudy of Verhoeven 201227 in the absence of 
treatment. As the prima ry population for the efficacy analysis is the micro -ITT, those 
values with zero  CFU have been excluded and the resulting data have been converted to 
the log 10 CFU scale . The SD of these value s has been used a s the estimate of variability 
for an anal ysis o f change from baseline whilst including baseline log 10 CFU as a 
covariate. As a result, a trial including  80 evaluable patients (40 per arm) woul d have  a 
greater than 90% po wer to det ect a true treatment effect  of a 2 log 10 CFU difference and 
an 90% power to detect a true treatment effect of a 1.5 log 10 CFU difference between XF -
73 and p lacebo, assuming 2-sided alpha=0.05, a  between patient  SD of 2 log 10 CFUs 
taken from t he V erhoeve n study .  
We estimate that approximately 125 patients w ill need to be recrui ted in order t o have 
around  80 patients with a burden  S. aureus  nasal carr iage which will a llow for t he 
detection of an effect of XF -73 nasal gel.

CONFIDENT IAL  60 14 ETHICAL, LEGAL AND ADMIN ISTRATIVE ASPECTS  
14.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure tha t the Sponsor and 
Investigator abide by the principles of the GCP guidelines of the ICH, a nd of the current 
version of the Declaration of Helsi nki (Brazil 2013) . The study als o will be carried out in 
keeping with local legal requi reme nts.  
14.2 Infor med Consent  
Before each patient  is admitted to the study, a pre -screening nasal swab inform ed consent  
will be obtained from the  patient  (or his/her legall y authorized repres entative) acc ording 
to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating c ountry ( i.e., the Declaration 
of Helsinki, ICH GCP, US Code of Fed eral Reg ulations for Prot ection of Human Patient s 
(21 Code Fe deral Regulation [CFR] 50.2 5 (a) and (b), CFR 50.27, and CF R Part 56, 
Subpart A), and other applicable local regul ations). If the  patient  is S. aureus  positive , 
he/she will be asked to sign the m ain ICF.  This consent for m mus t be dated and retained 
by the Investigator as part of the  study records. The  Investigator  will not undertake any 
investigation specifically requ ired only for t he clinical  study until valid co nsent has been 
obtained. The terms  of the consent and when it was obt ained must also be documen ted in 
the eCRF.  
If a proto col amendment is re quired, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the 
changes to the  protocol. If t he consent form is revised, it m ust be reviewed and approved 
by th e approp riate IEC/ IRB and  signed by  all patient s subsequently  enrolled in the study 
as well as those curren tly enrolled in the study.  
14.3 Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before th e start of the study, the study protocol and/or  other relevant documents will be 
approved  by the IEC/IRB/C ompetent A uthorities, in accordance with local legal 
requiremen ts. The Sponsor mus t ensure that  all ethical and legal requirements have been 
met befor e the first patient is enr olled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exa ctly. To  alter the protoc ol, amendm ents must be 
written, rece ive approval from the appro priate personnel, a nd receive 
IRB/IEC/Competent Authority approval prior to implementat ion (if appropr iate).  
Adm inistrative changes ( not affecting the patient  benefit/ risk rat io) may be made w ithout 
the need for a formal amendme nt. All amendments will be distributed to all protocol 
recipients, with appropriate instructions.  
14.4 Archiving Study Reco rds 
Accordi ng to ICH g uidelines, essential documents should be retained for a  minimum  of 
2 years after  the last approval of a marketing ap plication in an ICH region and until there 
are no pending o r contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 
2 years have e lapsed since the form al discontinuation of clinical dev elopment  of the 
investiga tional pro duct. However, these docum ents should be retained for  a longer period 
if required by the applicable legal requirements.

events that s uggest a possible hazard t o patient s if the study con tinues, the study m ay be 
termina ted after appropriate consultation between the relevant  parties. The s tudy may 
also be terminated earl y at the Sponsor’s discretion in t he absen ce of such a find ing. 
Condi tions that may warrant ter mination include, but are n ot limited to:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the  patients 
enrol led in the study;  
• Failure to enrol patient s at an acceptable rate;  
• A decis ion on the part o f the Spon sor to suspend or disconti nue development of the 
drug. 
14.6 Confidentiality  
All study find ings and documents will be  regarded as confidential. Th e Investigator and 
members  of his/her research team must not disclose such inform ation wi thout prior 
writt en approva l from the Sponsor.  
The an onymity of participating patients must be main tained. Patie nts will be identified on 
eCRFs and other documents sub mitted to  by th eir patient  number, i nitials 
and/or birth date, not by name. Do cuments not to be  submitted  to Pharm -Olam  that 
identi fy the patient  (e.g., the s igned ICF) must be maintained in  confidence by the 
Investigator.  
14.7 Future Use of Stored Spec imens  
In or der to appr opriately assess the incidence of post -operative staphy lococcal  infections 
inves tigators w ill take all reasonable ef forts to obtain microbiolog ical documentation and 
a bacteri al isolate when the suspicion of a staphylococcal post-operative infec tion is 
raised. This includes bu t is not limited to the collection  and cul ture of exudates,  blood, 
implant or other specimens a ccording to the suspected s ite of infection.  
The Sponsor i s planning to store these  samples as well as those bacterial isolates obtained 
from the nasal swabs after the completion of the study fo r up to 10 years for furt her 
analys is and characterization.  The details of these tests a re not known at thi s time. No 
subject identifying information will be retained for thes e samples. The Informed Co nsent 
Form explains t he storage and future use of speci mens and  subjects will be  asked to

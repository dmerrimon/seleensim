 Monitoring and Quality Assurance 
During the course of the clincal trial an Ora, Inc. monitor, or designee, will make routine 
site visits to review protocol compliance, assess IP accountabi lity, and ensure the clinical 
trial is being conducted according to the pertinent regulatory requirements. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner that adequately m aintains subject 
confidentiality. Further details of the clinical trial monitori ng will be outlined in a 
monitoring plan. 
Regulatory authorities of domes tic and foreign agencies, qualit y assurance, or designees 
may carry out on-site inspections and audits, which may include source data checks. 
Therefore, direct access to the original source data will be re quired for inspections and 
audits. All inspections and audits  will be carried out giving c onsideration to data 
protection as well as subject confidentiality to the extent tha t local, state, and federal laws 
apply. 
10 ADVERSE EVENTS 
 Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of  IP in 
humans, whether or not considered  IP-related. An AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an I P, without any judgment about ca usality. An AE can arise 
from any use of the IP (e.g., off-label use, use in combination  with another drug or 
medical device) and from any route of administration, formulati on, or dose, including an 
overdose. An AE can arise from any delivery, implantation, or u se of a medical device, 
including medical device failure, subject characteristics that may impact medical device 
performance (e.g., anatomical limitations), and therapeutic par ameters (e.g., energy 
applied, sizing, dose release, a nd anatomic fit) associated with medical device use. 
All AEs spontaneously reported by the subject, in response to a n open question from 
clinical trial personnel, or re vealed by observation, physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures will be recorded in the source document a nd on the appropriate 
pages of the eCRF. Any clinically  relevant deterioration in cli nical finding is considered 
an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms i ndicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. Any pre-existing 
medical condition that worsens after administration of study me dication will also be 
considered a new adverse event . Study medication includes the d rug under evaluation or 
any other medications required by the protocol given during any  stage of the clinical trial. 
Ocular complaints should not be ad dressed as AEs unless the com plaint is outside the 
normal limits for allergic conjunctivitis symptoms after allerg en exposure or is associated 
with clinical sequelae (i.e., adve rse slit lamp examination fin ding).

Clinical Tri al Protocol: ADX-102-AC-010  Version 2.0, 24 August 2018 
 
Confidential   Page 40 of 69 
 Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature,  date of onset, end date, 
severity, and relationship to IP , action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by the physician or reported by the subject up on indirect questioning. 
10.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the  degree of intensity of an 
AE as determined by the investig ator or reporte d by the subject . The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of  relationship to IP or seriousn ess of the event and should 
be evaluated according to the following scale: 
  
  
  
10.1.2 Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must assess wh ether they consider an AE to be drug-related.  In 
assessing this relationship, the i nvestigator must use informat ion about the 
conditions/concurrent medicati on, and chronology of the event relative to drug 
administration.  The following cha racterizations will be used:  
 Definitely Related 
 Probably Related 
 Possibly Related 
 Unlikely to be related 
 Not Related 
10.1.3 Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information 
about the IP using t hese explanations: 
 Unexpected :  an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the s pecificity or 
severity that has been observed. 
 Expected :  an AE that is liste d in the IB at the sp ecificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
 Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to the IP. 
AE events that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a clas s of products or as 
anticipated from the pharmacol ogical/mechanical (or other) prop erties of the product, but

 are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular product under 
investigation, are to be  considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initia lly classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final 
classification is subject to the determination of the Sponsor’s  Medical Monitor. 
 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the inves tigator or Sponsor/designee, 
the AE results in any of t he following outcomes: 
 death; 
 a life-threatening AE; 
Note:  An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view o f either the 
investigator or Sponsor/designee, the subject at immediate risk  of death as a result 
of the AE.  "Life threatening" does not include an AE that, had  it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. 
 inpatient hospitalization or pro longation of existing hospitali zation; 
Note:  The term “inpatient hospi talization” refers to any inpat ient admission (even 
if less than 24 hours).  For chr onic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive car e inpatient unit.  
Inpatient hospitalization does not include:  emergency room vis its; 
outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; or admission to obse rvation/short 
stay units, rehabilitation facili ties, hospice facilities, nursing homes, or clinical 
research/Phase 1 units. 
Note:  The term “prolongation of  existing hospitalization” refe rs to any extension 
of an inpatient hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated or required for the 
reason for the initial admission, as determined by the investig ator or treating 
physician. 
 a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruptio n of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; and 
Note:  A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to vi sual threat would 
be interpreted as any potential im pairment or damage to the sub ject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer, or damage to the optic 
nerve). 
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may  not result in d eath, are life-threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appr opriate medical

 judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defi nition. 
 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs and their outcomes must be reported to Ora, Inc., the Sponsor, and the IRB/IEC 
as required by the IRB/IEC, federal, state, or local regulation s and governing health 
authorities and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Collection of  AEs/SAEs will begin at 
the time of informed consent and may be recorded up until 30 days post-instillation of IP. 
10.3.1 Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction 
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to Ora, Inc., the Sponsor 
and the IRB/IEC as required by the IRB/IEC, fed eral, state, or local regulations and 
governing health authorities. 
10.3.2 Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 
To ensure subject safety, all SA Es, regardless of relationship to the IP, must be 
immediately reported.  All information relevant to the SAE must  be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.  The investigat or is obligated to pursue and obtain information 
requested by Ora, Inc. and/or th e Sponsor/designee in addition to that information 
reported on the eCRF.  All subjects experiencing a SAE must be followed up and the 
outcome reported.  
In the event of a SAE, the inves tigator must notify the appropriate contact in the Safety 
Management Plan  immediately; obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records,  
information, and medical judgments from colleagues who assisted  in the treatment and 
follow-up of the subject; provide Ora, Inc. and the Sponsor/des ignee a complete case 
history, which includes a statement as to whether the event was  or was not suspected to 
be related to the use of the IP; and inform the IRB of the SAE in a manner according to 
the IRB guidelines for reporting SAEs.  
 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable) 
When medically necessary, the i nvestigator may need to determin e what treatment has 
been assigned to a subject.  The investigator should make every  effort to contact Ora, Inc. 
to discuss the subject’s emergency situation and the need to un mask a clinical trial 
subject prior to unmasking IP.   
If the investigator determines that emergency unmasking is nece ssary, the investigator 
should identify the given subject’s clinical trial drug kit, wh ich contains a scratch-off 
laminate under which the treatment is identified along with the  associated lot number. In 
order to unmask, the investigator should scratch off the lamina te, using a flat object and 
applying pressure, to reveal the  treatment assigned for that su bject. The emergency 
unmasking should be performed by the designated site personnel.   The investigator must 
also indicate in source documents and in the eCRF that the mask  was broken and provide 
the date, time, and reason for breaking the mask.  Any AE or SA E associated with

 The secondary safety variables of visual acuity, s lit-lamp biomicroscopy, IOP, and 
dilated fundoscopy will be summarized  
 
 Statistical Analysis Plan 
Prior to database lock, the S ponsor will finalize a statistical analysis plan (SAP) that will 
detail all planned analyses. Any analyses conducted in addition  to those specified in the 
SAP will be clearly documented as post hoc. 
 Interim Analysis 
No interim analyses are planned.  
12 COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICES, 
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES 
This clinical trial will be conducted in compliance with the pr otocol, current GCPs, 
including the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines, and in general, 
consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, all a pplicable local, state, and 
federal requirements relevant to the use of IP in the countries involved will be adhered to. 
 Protection of Human Subjects 
12.1.1 Subject Informed Consent 
Informed consent must take place before any clinical trial spec ific procedures are 
initiated. Signed and dated written informed consent must be obtained from each subject or from the subject’s parent or legal guardian prior to enrollm ent into the clinical trial (if 
applicable). If the subject is under the legal age of consent, the consent form must be 
signed by a legal guardian or as required by state and/or local laws and regulations. 
All ICFs must be approved for use by the Sponsor and receive ap proval from an IRB 
prior to their use. If the consent form requires revision (e.g. , due to a protocol amendment 
or significant new safety infor mation), it is the investigator’ s responsibility to ensure that 
the amended informed consent is reviewed and approved by Ora, I nc. prior to submission 
to the governing IRB and that it is read, signed and dated by a ll subjects, subsequently 
enrolled in the clinical trial, as well as those currently enro lled in the clinical trial. 
If informed consent is taken under special circumstances (e.g.,  oral informed consent), 
then the procedures to be followe d must be agreed to by Ora, Inc. and Sponsor and 
provided in writing by Ora, Inc. and Sponsor prior to the consent process.

 12.1.2 Institutional Review Board Approval 
The clinical trial is to be conducted in accordance with IRB re gulations (U.S. 21 CFR 
Part 56.103). The investigator must obtain appropriate IRB appr oval before initiating the 
clinical trial and re-approval at least annually. 
Only an IRB approved version of the informed consent form will be used. 
 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
The clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the eth ical principles that 
originated with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 Subject Confidentiality 
All personal clinical trial subject data collected and processe d for the purposes of the 
clinical trial should be maintai ned by the investigator and sit e staff with adequate 
precautions as to ensure that the confidentiality of the data is in accordance with local, 
state, and federal laws and regulations. 
Monitors, auditors and other authorized representatives of Ora,  Inc., the Sponsor, the 
IRB/IEC approving this clinical trial, the Food and Drug Admini stration (FDA), the 
Department of Health and Human Services, other domestic governm ent agencies, and 
other foreign regulatory agencies  will be granted direct access  to the subject’s original 
medical and clinical trial records for verification of the data  and clinical trial procedures. 
Access to this information will be permitted to the aforementio ned individuals to the 
extent permitted by law. A report of the results of this clinical trial may be published or sent to the appropriate 
health authorities in any country in which the IP may ultimatel y be marketed, but the 
subject’s identity will not be disclosed in these documents. 
 Documentation 
Source documents may include a s ubject’s medical records, hospi tal charts, clinic charts, 
the investigator’s clinical trial subject files, as well as the  results of diagnostic tests such 
as X-rays, laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms. The investigator’s copy of the eCRFs 
serves as the investigator’s reco rd of a subject’s clinical trial-related data. 
12.4.1 Retention of Documentation 
All clinical trial related correspondence, subject records, consent forms, record of the 
distribution and use of all IP, and copies of eCRFs should be m aintained on file for at 
least two years after the last  approval of a marketing applicat ion in an ICH region, and 
until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applicatio ns in an ICH region; or 
until at least two years have elapsed since the formal disconti nuation of clinical 
development of the IP. These documents will be retained for a l onger period if required 
by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement wi th the Sponsor. It is the

 12.5.3 Accountability of Investigational Product 
The IP is to only be prescribed by the principal investigator o r the named sub-
investigator(s), and is to only be used in accordance with this  protocol. The IP must only 
be distributed to subjects properly qualified under this protocol to receive IP. 
The investigator must keep an accurate accounting of the IP rec eived from the supplier. 
This includes the amount of IP dispensed to subjects, amount of  IP returned to the 
investigator by the subjects, and the amount returned or disposed upon the completion of 
the clinical trial. A detailed inventory must be completed for the IP. 
12.5.4 Return or Disposal of Investigational Product 
At the conclusion of the clinical trial, IP reconciliation will  be performed and all 
remaining IP will be destructed and disposed of according to cl inical site’s SOP. Sponsor 
will be provided with a final accounting of IP for approval prior to destruction. 
 Recording of Data on Source Documents and Electronic Case 
Reports Forms (eCRFs) 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring clinical trial dat a is completely and accurately 
recorded on each subject’s eCRF, source document, and all clini cal trial-related material. 
All clinical trial data should also be attributable, legible, c ontemporaneous, and original. 
Recorded datum should only be corrected in a manner that does not obliterate, destroy, or 
render illegible the previous entry (e.g., by drawing a single line through the incorrect 
entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data). An individual who has 
corrected a data entry should ma ke clear who made the correctio n and when, by adding to 
the correction his/her initials as well as the date of the corr ection. 
Data entry of all enrolled and randomized subjects will use software that conforms to 21 
CFR Part 11 requirements, and will be performed only by staff who have been trained on 
the system and have access to the system. Data will not be ente red for screen failure 
subjects. An audit trail will be maintained within the electron ic system to capture all 
changes made within the eCRF database. After the end of the cli nical trial and database 
lock, compact discs (CDs) contai ning copies of all applicable s ubjects’ eCRFs will be 
provided to each investigator site to be maintained on file by the investigator. 
 Publications 
Authorship and manuscript composition will reflect cooperation among all parties 
involved in the clinical trial. Authorship will be established before writing the 
manuscript. Ora, Inc. and the Sponsor will have the final decis ion regarding the 
manuscript and publication.

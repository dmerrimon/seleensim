 2.  BACKGROUND  
  
2.1     Study Disease and Rationale  
  
The current standard of care for treatment of limited stage small cell lung cancer consists 
of chemotherapy plus thoracic irradiation (1), followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation 
(PCI).  The recommendation for PCI is based on the results of a meta -analysis in patients 
with limited stage small cell lung cancer which demonstrated a 5.4% increase in overall 
survival with the addition of PCI to chemo -radiation therapy for the primary lung tumor  
(2).    
  
Unfortunately, it is well documented that whole bra in radiation therapy is associated with 
neurocognitive toxicity (3 -7) and that there is a direct relationship between 
neurocognitive dysnfunction and worsening quality of life (8).  This toxicity is 
particularly important in patients being treated with PCI  for SCLC since they represent a 
potentially curable patient population who have a relatively high likelihood of surviving 
long enough to develop the long -term sequalae of therapy.   
3 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013    
The precise mechanism of radiation induced neurotoxicity remains unclea r and the effect 
is likely multi -factorial.  However, emerging data suggests that radiation induced damage 
to neural progenitor cells within the hippocampus may play a role.  Animal studies have 
shown that new neurons and glia are produced throughout adult  life from neural stem cell 
precursors in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of 
the hippocampal dentate gyrus (9 -11).  These cells play an important role in injury repair 
within the central nervous system (12,13).  S imilarly, these cells migrate to the site of 
inflammation caused by irradiation or brain injury (13).  
  
Multiple animal studies have shown that neural progenitor cells are extremely sensitive to 
radiation (14 -17).  Tada et al. showed that 2 Gy of radiatio n effectively killed 
proliferating cells in both the SVZ of the lateral ventricles (14) and the subgranular zone 
of the dentate gyrus (15). The anti -proliferative effects last for up to 15 months after a 
single radiation treatment (18) and are dose depende nt (19,20). There is repair over time 
following low doses of radiation, suggesting likely recovery of cells with fractionation 
(14).    
  
There is an association between radiation -induced neural progenitor cell impairment and 
neurocognitive decline after c entral nervous system irradiation in rodents.  Cranial 
irradiation significantly decreases hippocampal neurogenesis and is associated with 
impaired performance of hippocampal -dependent tasks 19 -22, indicating that newly born 
cells may be essential for norm al hippocampal functioning.    
  
Several studies suggest that neurogenic areas similar to those described in the rodent 
brain exist in the human brain as well.  For example, Eriksson et al. (23) demonstrated 
that progenitor cells in the human dentate gyrus divide to form new neurons, while Sanai 
et al. (24) found that astrocytes in the human SVZ of the lateral ventricles divide in vivo 
and act as multipotent progenitor cells in vitro.  Human studi es have likewise 
demonstrated cognitive deficits following cranial irradiation, most notably in children 
(25-28).  This decline includes diminished capability to learn and memorize new tasks 
and information, as well as a dramatic reduction in full -scale IQ  (29).   
  
Recent human studies have demonstrated that it is possible to use intensity modulated 
radiation therapy (IMRT) to reduce the radiation dose to the hippocampus during 
radiation therapy for brain tumors (30 -32).  In addition, preliminary data usin g a mouse 
model has suggested that NPC sparing radiation may allow improved survival of neural 
progenitor cells compared to conventional radiation treatment plans, at least at an early 
time point (33).  Similarly, recent data from a prospective study in ch ildren treated with 
radiation therapy to the brain suggests an inverse relationship between radiation dose to 
the hippocampus and performance on neurocognitive testing (34), and a randomized trial 
comparing 25 Gy versus 36 Gy of PCI found that the risk of chronic neurotoxicity was 
significantly higher in the 36 Gy arm (35).  
  
4 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  The purpose of this study is to evaluate performance on neurocognitive testing following 
hippocampal -sparing PCI relative to the historical experience of patients (RTOG 0212) 
who rece ived standard PCI.  
  
    
2.2 Correlative Studies Background  
  
Correlative studies include a neurocognitive function test battery that has been validated 
in a multi -institutional phase III study by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 
(RTOG) in the contex t of brain metastases (36,37).  The tests will be performed by a 
trained examiner.  The tests utilized in this protocol are described briefly below:  
    
2.2.1 Mini Mental State Examination  
          
The Mini Mental State Examination (38) is designed to e valuate global 
function.  It consists of six tasks designed to evaluate short -term memory 
retention and recall, attention, and language.  The maximum score is 30.  
Scores fall into 4 categories:  
  
● 24-30: “Normal” range   
● 20-23: Mild cognitive impairment  
● 10-19: Moderate cognitive impairment  
● 0-9: Severe cognitive impairment  
  
      2.2.2    Trail Making Test   
            
The Trail Making Test A is designed to evaluate visual motor scanning speed 
and the Trail Making Test B is designed to evaluate executiv e function 
(39,40).  These tests require patients to connect circles in numerical (part A) 
or alternating numerical and alphabetical sequence (part B) within a timed 
interval of less than 5 minutes for each test.  Results are reported as the 
number of seco nds required to complete the task with higher scores reflecting 
higher degrees of impairment.  
  
  Average  Deficient  Rule of Thumb  
Trail A  29 seconds  >78 seconds  Most in 90 seconds  
Trail B  75 seconds  >273 seconds  Most in 3 minutes  
  
      2.2.3 Controlled Oral Word Association Test   
  
The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) is designed to evaluate 
letter -cued verbal fluency.  It requires patients to name words beginning with 
a specific letter with increasing associated activity, i n three 1minute periods.  
5 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  Scoring is based on the number of words named during the 1minute periods, 
with adjustments for education and age.  Individual scores are categorized as 
intact, low average, borderline, deficient, or seriously deficient, based on t heir 
scores after these adjustments (41).    
  
      2.2.4 Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised   
  
The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised is designed to evaluate memory.   
It requires patients to memorize a list of 12 items for three consecutive tests  
(recall), to identify the same 12 items from a list of semantically related or 
unrelated items (recognition), and to recall the same 12 items after a 15minute 
delay (delayed recall).  Scoring and interpretation are simple, and outlined in a 
professional man ual (42).  
  
      2.2.5 EORTC Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and the 
Brain Cancer Module 20  
  
 The EORTC Quality of Life questionnaire (QLQ -C30, Appendix B) is a 30 
item questionnaire designed for and validated in cancer patients.  It consists o f 
9 multi -item scales —1 global scale, 5 functional scales (physical, role, 
emotional, cognitive and social), 3 symptom scales (nausea, pain, fatigue).  
The remaining 6 questions are single items addressing other symptoms and 
financial impact.  The Brain Ca ncer Module 20 (BN 20, Appendix C) is a 20 
question addendum to QLQ -C30 designed specifically for patients with brain 
tumors.  It assesses neurologic deficits, future uncertainty and disease and 
treatment related symptoms.  
  
 2.3   Additional Testing  
 The following tests will be administered to the subject after those outlined in 
Section 2.2 have been completed.  
  
2.3.1 Brief Visuospatial Memory Test -Revised  
The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test -Revised is designed to evaluate 
nonverbal/visuospatial lear ning and memory. It serves as a non -verbal 
analogue to the HVLT -R, and is generally more sensitive to right 
hippocampal functioning. It requires patients to learn a series of six figures 
printed on a page over the course of three exposure trials (immediate  recall), 
recall those same six figures after a 15 -20 minute delay (delayed recall), and 
identify the figures from among an equal number of foils (recognition). 
Scoring and interpretation are simple, and outlined in a professional manual 
(43).  
  
6 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  2.3.2 Category -cued verbal fluency  
The Category Fluency Test is designed to evaluate semantically -guided verbal 
generativity and is often administered in conjunction with the COWAT. It 
requires patients to name as many different category exemplars as they can i n 
2 60-second trials. Scoring involves tallying the number of acceptable words 
reported for the two trials and interpretation is simple and outlined in a 
professional manual (44).  
  
2.3.3 Brief Test of Attention  
The Brief Test of Attention is designed to  evaluate auditory divided attention 
and can be used with individuals with visual and motor impairments that 
preclude tests requiring visual scanning or manual dexterity. It requires 
patients to count numbers or letters from lists read aloud consisting of both 
types of stimuli. The number of correctly monitored lists is tallied, with raw 
scores ranging from 0 to 20. Interpretation is simple and outlined in a 
professional manual (45).  
  
2.3.4 Hopkins Adult Reading Test  
The Hopkins Adult Reading Test is des igned to evaluate pre -illness intellect. 
It requires patients read aloud a series of 35 printed, phonetically irregular 
words. The number of correctly pronounced words is tallied and entered into 
a formula along with demographic characteristics to estimate  WAIS -III Full 
Scale IQ [ (86.664 + 0.145(age) − 6.136(sex) − 8.642(race) + 0.564(educ)  +  
0.862 + 1.140(HART), when age is coded in years; sex is coded 1 (male) or 2 
(female); race is coded 1 (non -black) or 2 (black); education is coded in years 
as the hig hest grade completed] (46).   
  
2.3.5 Perceptual Comparison Test   
The Perceptual Comparison Test is designed to evaluate mental processing 
speed. It requires patients make speeded same/different distinctions in 
response to pairs of letter strings and pairs  of patterns over the course of two 
90-second trials. Scoring involves tallying the number of correct responses 
across the two trials, with higher scores reflecting faster processing speed 
(47).

5.1.5 Therapy Interruption  
  
For radiation therapy interruptions of up to and including 14 days, irradiation 
should be completed to the full presc ribed dose.  On the last day, the total 
number of fractions and the reasons for interrupting therapy must be 
documented  
  
If radiation therapy interruption goes beyond 14 days, the patient will be 
removed from the protocol treatment.  Resumption and compl etion of 
treatment will then be at the discretion of the radiation oncologist in 
consultation with the principal investigator.  All patients who initiate protocol 
treatment will be followed per the study calendar.  
    
5.1.6 Risks of Radiation  
  
              Short term toxicities of radiation therapy include fatigue, alopecia,                      
erythema or irritation of the skin, dry skin, headaches, worsening of current                    
symptoms, edema of brain requiring steroids, ear pain or discom fort, damage                    to the 
baby if patient is or becomes pregnant, seizures, neurologic deficits                    depending on 
tumor location, edema of brain requiring surgery, death.  Long                    term toxicities 
include memory lo ss, cataracts, edema of the brain requiring                    steroids, vision loss, 
hearing loss, necrosis of brain  requiring surgery                     second tumor or cancer caused 
by radiation.  
  
 5.2   Duration of Follow Up  
  
Patients will be followed until death or the time of data analysis.  Follow -up visits 
may be performed at outside hospitals and records sent to Johns Hopkins. Patients will 
undergo neurocognitive and QOL testing at baseline and 6 months and 12 months 
follo wing PCI. They will have brain MRI every six months for 2 years following 
completion of PCI. It is preferred that MRIs be performed at Johns Hopkins Hospital 
but they may also be performed at outside facilities as necessary for insurance, 
scheduling, or ot her reasons.  
  
    
 5.3   Criteria for Removal from Study  
  
   Patients will be removed from the study for the following reasons:  
  
11 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  5.3.1 Unacceptable toxicity from therapy.  Toxicity must be appropriately 
documented.  
  
5.3.2 Development of intercurrent, non -cancer related illness that prevents 
either continuation of therapy or regular follow -up.  
  
5.3.3 The patient may decide to discontinue enrollment in the protocol at 
any time and for any reason.    
  
              All reasons for discontinuation of treatment must be documented.    
   
12 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013   6.  STUDY CALENDAR  
  
Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within approximately 30 days prior to initiation of 
radiation therapy.  Patients will be evaluated at least weekly during  the course of radiation 
therapy.  Note that the study calendar is based on the ideal subject.  The schedule should be 
followed as closely as realistically possible, but may be modified due to problems such as 
scheduling delays, conflicts such as clinic cl osure or poor weather conditions, or other 
unforeseeable events.

 8.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
  
 8.1   Study Design/Endpoints  
    
      8.1.1   Study Design   
This is a single -arm phase II prospective study of patients with limited stage  
SCLC to evaluate neurocognitive outcomes following hippocampal -sparing 
PCI (25 Gy in 10 fractions) relative to a historical control receiving standa rd 
PCI (RTOG 0212 arm receiving 25 Gy in 10 fractions).  
16 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013    
8.1.2 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is cognitive function, specifically 
memory, six months from the completion of PCI as measured by the HVLTR -
delayed recall.    
  
8.1.3 Secondary Endpoints  
  
 8.1.3.1    Cognitive function, specifically memory, at 12 months from PCI as   
          measured by the HVLT -R delayed recall  
  
8.1.3.2           A composite cognitive function endpoint using the validated               
Reliable Cha nge Index (48,49) to include the Controlled Word    
Association Test (COWAT), the HVLT -R-delayed recall, the   
HVLT -R-trials 1 -3 and Trail Making Tests part A and B (TMT)  
            
8.1.3.3           Quality of Life (QOL) as measured using the EORTC Quali ty of   
          Life Questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and Brain Cancer Module 20              
(BN20) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months  
    
8.1.3.4           Development of brain metastases at 2 years following completion   
of radiation therapy will be coded as a binary variable (yes or no)  
  
           8.1.3.5   Development of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis at 2 years following completion of 
radiation therapy will be coded as a binary variable (yes or no)  
  
8.1.3.6         Overall survival  
  
 8.2   Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
  
      8.2.1   Sample Size       
The sample size calculations address the specific primary hypothesis that 
patients treated with hippocampal -sparing PCI for SCLC will not experience as 
much decline in ne urocognitive function as reported for the historical control 
of RTOG 0212 receiving the same dose of conventional PCI.  The clinically 
meaningful difference and associated standard deviation are based on the 
RTOG study and the work of Meyers et al.  The la tter reported a mean score in 
the HVLT -R delayed recall change in patients treated only with whole -brain 
radiation therapy of 0.87 (from 7.04 at baseline to 6.17 at 6 months), with a 
standard deviation of 3.19.  In RTOG 0212, the average decline in HVLT 
memory at six months is 1.13 (sd=2.80).  We expect patients receiving 
hippocampal -sparing PCI to experience a smaller decline in cognitive function 
from baseline to six months, compared to the historical control group. The 
17 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  onesided statistical hypothesis tes t is as follows: H0: Δμ = 1 vs. HA: Δμ < 1, 
where Δμ  is the mean change in HVLT scores from baseline to 6 months for 
patients receiving hippocampal -sparing PCI (baseline minus 6 -month score). 
With change measured in 100 patients, we will have 90% power to detect a 
meaningful change (0.88 points less change in HVLT scores over 6 months,  
i.e., mean change of 0.12) in our treated group with a one -sided test at the 5% 
level of significance, assuming a standard deviation of around 3.  Similarly, we 
will have 80% power with a one -sided 5% level test to detect a mean change of 
0.75 (with standard deviation equal to 3).  We will enroll 125 patients to a llow 
for up to 20% of patients to be not evaluable at 6 months.  
    
        8.2.2   Accrual  
  
We anticipate enrollment of approximately 2 patients per month to the protocol 
with accrual completed in approximately 5 years.    
  
8.3   Stratification Factors   
  
      There will be no stratification factors upon initial enrollment in the protocol.    
  
  8.4  Statistical Methods of Analysis  
  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate change in cognitive function as 
measured by the HVLT -R-delayed reca ll.  We will compare hippocampal -sparing 
PCI to the historical experience of patients who received standard PCI in RTOG 
0212. Each patient will be assessed pre -therapy and post -therapy, with the change at 6 
months being the primary endpoint. Patient scores  on the HVLT -R delayed recall 
section are whole numbers, ranging from 0 to 12, with lower scores indicating 
declining cognitive function.   The score itself refers to the number of words a patient 
can recall from a list of 12 words.  Therefore, if a patien t initially is able to recall 8 
words pre -therapy and is, at 6 months, able to only recall 6 words, their change in 
score would be 2. The primary endpoint (change score) is the difference between the 
pre-therapy and post -therapy scores. A change score of z ero indicates preserved 
cognitive function.   Change scores from -1 to -12 indicated improved cognitive 
function and are not expected.  Summary statistics of the change scores, such as 
means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges will be listed separate ly by treatment 
(sparing PCI and historical standard PCI groups). We hypothesize that change scores 
from pre -therapy to 6 months post -therapy is lower among patients receiving 
hippocampal -sparing PCI compared to the historical PCI group in the RTOG study. 
We will use the Wilcoxon Signed -Rank test to test the change in HVLT -R scores 
over six months, relative to the expectation based on the historical information, 
according to the statistical hypotheses given in the sample size section (Section 
8.2.1).  
  
18 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  The analysis of the secondary outcome of HVLT -R-delay score change at 12 months 
will be performed as described above for the primary outcome.  In addition, we will 
examine if there appears to be a trend to increasing change score over time for the 
treatmen t groups.   
  
The Reliable Change Index will measure meaningful change between baseline and 6 
and 12 months for HVLT –R, Trail Making Test part A and B, COWAT.  The 
Reliable Change Index is derived from the standard error of measurement (SEM) for 
each test in the battery. The SEM is calculated from the test –retest reliability (r) and 
the standard deviation of test scores (SD): SEM=sqrt[SD×(1 -r)].  The standard error 
of the difference (SEdiff ) is then calculated as SEdiff =sqrt[2×(SEM)2].  For each 
test in t he neurocognitve battery, the Reliable Change Index value will be determined 
a priori  for that particular test to determine whether a change from baseline is 
clinically meaningful.    
  
We will compute summary statistics and compare our patients to the his torical 
controls based on tests that are appropriate for the type of data.  
  
Quality of Life on our study will be assessed using EORTC Quality of Life 
questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and the Brain Cancer Module 20 (BN 20) pre -therapy, at 6 
months, and at 12 month s after therapy. For each module, summary statistics of the 
scores will be reported for each study time point. Change scores in quality of life 
from pre -therapy to post -therapy will be calculated and tested via paired t -tests for the 
hippocampal -sparing PC I treatment group. We may fit mixed -effect models to 
explore changes in quality of life assessments over time.   
  
We will tabulate development of brain metastases within 0.5 mm of the hippocampus.  
We will report adverse events based on CTCAE v4.0 by freq uency tables.  We will 
test the proportion of patients who develop brain metastases via binomial test.  
Overall survival will be measured from the start of treatment to death or last 
followup. For subjects who alive or lost follow up at the end of study, o verall survival 
will be censored at the last follow up date. Overall survival probabilities will be 
estimated via the Kaplan -Meier method; median survival and 95% confidence 
interval via Greenwood’s formula for variance will be reported.   
  
8.5   Safety M onitoring  
We have included a formal statistical stopping rule for monitoring the occurrence of 
brain metastases.  The article describing RTOG 0212 reported that the raw proportion 
of patients with brain metastases is 22% (29/131) at 1 year for the group g etting 2.5 
Gy in 10 fractions.  We established a monitoring rule that will recommend 
considering stopping the study if there appears to be high probability that the risk of 
brain metastasis at 1 year is above 22%.  Specifically, if the posterior probabilit y that 
the risk exceeds 25% of brain metastasis by 1 year after treatment is 75% or greater 
(3:1 odds), then we will consider stopping the study.  In this calculation, the number 
of patients with brain metastasis at 1 year is a binomial random variable.  T he prior 
19 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  distribution for the risk of brain metastasis by 1 year is beta with parameters 29 & 
102.  Although we can apply the stopping rule calculation after every patient, we may 
monitor in batches of 10.  The stopping rule is illustrated in the figure be low.  
  
  
 9.  ADVERSE EVENTS AND RECORDING   
  
9.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition during or following an exposure to a 
treatment, whether or not considered causally related to the treatment.  An 
undesirable medical condition may be symptoms (headache, nausea), signs  
(tachycardia, enlarged liver), or abnormal results of an investigation (MRI, laboratory 
finding).  In clinical trials, from the time of signing an informed consent, an AE may 
include an undesirable medical condition, occurring at any time, even if no trial 
treatment has been administered.   
  
    9.2  Radiation Related Adverse Events    
  
All radiation related adverse events will be recorded on the local toxicity case report 
forms.  
   

20 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013      
10. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) AND REPORTING  
  
      10.1  Serious Adverse Event  
  
10.1.1  Definition of Ser ious Adverse Event  
  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring at any point during a clinical trial that 
fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
  
● Results in death.  
● Is immediately life threatening.  
● Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
● Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
● Unexpected event that cause harm or place person at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized, and which was possibly r elated to 
the research.  Unexpected means that the event was not described in the 
consent form or the event exceeded the expected severity.  
● Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed above.  
  
     10.2  SAE Reporting Guidelines for Johns Hopkins Hospital  
  
All SAE, with the exception of death, must be reported to the Johns Hopkins Hospital 
Institutional Review Board (JH -IRB) within 10 working days of the principa l 
investigator learning of the event.  Reporting for the death of a patient which was 
unexpected (i.e.: not related to a risk of participation that was listed in the protocol or 
the consent document, and was more likely than not to be caused by the researc h 
procedure/intervention, must be reported to the JH -IRB within 3 working days of 
when the principal investigator receives the report of the death.  Reporting for death 
of a participant that was e xpected due to the nature of the patient’s underlying diseas e 
or condition, or identified as caused by a possible risk of the study 
procedure/intervention as described in this protocol or consent form, must be reported 
to the JH -IRB within 10 working days from the time the principal investigator learns 
of the event .  If death occurs 30 days after the participant has stopped or completed 
their study treatment, the principal investigator does not have to report the death until 
the time of continuing review.    
  
11.    DATA AND SAFETY REPORTING/ REGULATORY CONSIDERATI ONS  
  
   11.1   Data Quality Monitoring  
  
This is a DSMP Level I study under the SKCCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
(09/22/2011). The Clinical Research Office QA Group will perform an audit at the 
21 J12127 Version: November 14, 2013  end of the first year and periodically depending on the rate of accrual and prior audit 
results. All trial monitoring and reporting will be reviewed annually by the SKCCC 
Safety Monitoring Committee.  
  
In addition to the ongoing quality as surance evaluations for each individual at the 
time of treatment, there will be regular meetings between the principal investigator, a 
medical oncologist, and the study coordinator to assess the data quality.  This meeting 
will occur annually and a monitor ing report of the findings will be submitted to the 
Data Safety Monitoring Committee on an annual basis.  Any protocol deviations or 
violations will be documented in the monitoring reports.  The review will include: 
consent forms, eligibility criteria, pro tocol compliance, treatment administration, 
toxicity reports, response, regulatory compliance, case report forms (completeness as 
well as verifying that information coded on the case report forms are supported by 
source documents), and all other materials related to the trial.  In addition, this trial 
will be audited annually by the central clinical research office at Johns Hopkins.    
  
   11.2   Data Safety Monitoring  
  
All SAE’s and major protocol deviations that occur at Johns Hopkins Hospital will be 
submitted to the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center Data Monitoring 
Committee for review per Institutional guidelines.  In addition, the overall study 
safety and potential activation of the study’s early stopping rules will be assessed at 
the time o f every SAE.  The Data Safety Monitoring Committee with review this trial 
for safety annually.   
  
 11.3  Data Reporting  
  
 11.3.1  Method   
  
Data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRF’s). These CRF’s will be 
completed by the Study Coordinator. The CRF’s for each subject will be kept 
in a separate research binder. Along with each completed CRF there will be 
corresponding source documentati on filed for verification. The Principal 
Investigator, Research Nurse, and Study Coordinator will informally meet on 
a regular basis to make sure that the trial is progressing as mandated by the 
protocol. The Clinical Research Office (CRO) will audit this trial per their 
standards to ensure and verify that the protocol is being carried out according 
to plan as well as to verify tha t data included on subject CRF’s are accurate. 
Exit reports generated as a result of these CRO audits will be forwarded to 
both the Safety Monitoring Committee as well as to the IRB of record for 
review.

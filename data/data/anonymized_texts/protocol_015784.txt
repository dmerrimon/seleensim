 Research Synopsis  
Study Population: Medicaid or dual -eligible (Medicare -Medicaid) adults aged  21 years and 
older with multiple chronic conditions (MCC), including at least one physical health condition 
and at least one additional physical or behavioral health  condition , beneficiaries/members of 
our partnering health care payer, and identified as having high and/or rising health care needs 
and at risk for unplanned health care use.  
 
Study Design: A comparative effectiveness study using an individual -level , randomized design 
along with a pragmatic, mixed -methods approach to compare  three  strategies  (e.g.,  in-person  
and telephonic  supported  care, technology -supported care,  and optimal discharge planning 
care)  all of which include  evidence -based components of integrated care. Quantitative ( e.g.,  
self-report, claims, process) and qualitative ( e.g.,  interviews) data will be collected across 
multiple timepoints during the study period.  
 
Sample Size: We expect to enroll 1, 400 individuals .  
 
Study Duration: The cont ract period begins January 1, 2018 and  concludes November  30, 202 4.  
Background and Significance  
Chronic disease is widely recognized as the U.S. public health challenge of the 21st century.1 
Defined as “conditions that last a year or more and require ongoing medical attention and/or 
limit activities of daily living,”2 these diseases comprise a wide range of physical illnesses, such 
as dia betes, arthritis, asthma, heart disease, chronic obstr uctive pulmonary disease , and 
hypertension, as well as mental health and substance use disorders. Among the Medicaid 
population, 80% of high -need beneficiaries have three or more chronic conditions , and 60% 
have five or more chronic conditions, including a high incidence of behavioral health issues.3,4 
Three in five of the 9 million individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid ( e.g. dual -
eligible) services have multiple chronic physical conditions, 20% have more than one 
mental/cognitive conditio n, and almost two in five have comorbid physical/behavioral health 
conditions.5,6 
Although numerous randomized controlled trials have shown that practice -based integrated 
chronic care models assist ing patients and their caregivers in managing their h ealth and health 
care can improve outcomes for various chronic conditions,7-13 including comorbid medical and 
behavioral health issues,14-17 implementation of these models has been limited due to the 
significant upfront financial and infrastructure investments that are typically required.18,19 
Related interventions, such as transitional care ,20,21 self-management education,22-24 and 
coordinated care,25 have also been proven effective in improv ing outcomes for adults with 
multiple chronic conditions (MCC) , but there is still considerable uncertainty about how best to 
implement these practices to achieve widespread and significant impact.19,26,27 The fact that 
different approaches may be required in order to optimally support specific patient subgroups 
adds a further layer of complexity.28,29 For example, there is very little information available 
about how to effectively support Medicaid29 and dual -eligible enrollees,30 who are often sicker, 
report lower health and functional status, and are m ore likely to be disabled than their 
4 
 Medicare -only counterparts.31 Targeting intensive care management services to these high -
need patients is an increasingly well -recognized best practice.32 
Despite increased understanding of how to promote optimal care for individuals with MCC , 
widespread improvements in health outcomes ha ve yet to be realized, especially for high -risk, 
high -need subgroups.  There have been no head -to-head trials comparing the effectiveness of 
system -level interventions in supporting the delivery of evidence -based integrated care for 
adults with MCC in gener al or the Medicaid and dual -eligible populations to date . The proposed 
study will assess innovative approaches  of integrated care that can be leveraged to address this 
gap.  
To this end, we propose to compare the effectiveness of the two primary system -level 
features that drive these programs, namely personalized service design and innovative use of 
technology in delivering four evidence -based, patient -centered components of e stablished 
integrated chronic care models: (1) interdisciplinary care team  management;33,34 (2) 
development and monitoring of individual care plans;33,34 (3) patient education and chronic 
disease self -management/self -care support;7,33,35 -39 and (4) supporting member linkages with 
medical/behavioral health and socia l services.33,40,41 The hybrid nature of the proposed 
interventions is both unique and compelling. No single, system -level intervention has yet to 
combine all four components of integrated care that have been proven effective in improving 
outcomes for patients with MCC.  
Objectiv es 
The goal of this collaborative study is to provide much  needed information for adults living with 
MCC  and other key stakeholders working to support the health of these adults through health 
care system improvements. The three care strategies , High -Touch  (in-person and telephonic 
supported) , High -Tech  (technology -supported)  and Optimal Discharge Planning (ODP)  will be 
implemented and evaluated to determine their potential to serve as best practice for 
effectively managing chronic conditions . 
To ensure  our study’s focus was patient -centered, the study team work ed closely with the 
Patient Partner Co -Investigator  and patient, provider, and system -level stakeholders to develop 
all aspects of this study protocol , including the early development efforts of in-person and 
technology -supported care approaches , the research questions, the study outcomes, the 
evaluation procedures, and the dissemination strategies included in this protocol.  
Aims  
This study aims to compare the effectiveness of the approaches on patient -centered 
outcomes and determine wh ich care strategy  works best for whom and under what 
circumstance s. By observing comparisons on key outcomes with ODP , our findings will enable 
patients and health care systems to understand the relative effectiveness of the  care strategies  
vis-à-vis current practi ce and provide much -needed information for patients with MCC as well 
as health systems striving to support them more effectively and efficiently .  
 
Primary Aim 1:  Compare the effectiveness of High -Touch, High -Tech, and ODP  on primary 
outcomes including hospital readmission, health status, and patient activation, and on several 
5 
 secondary outcomes including functional status, quality of life, care satisfaction, emerg ent care 
use, engagement in primary, specialty, and mental health care, and gaps in care.  
Hypothesis 1a:  High -Touch will result in lower readmission rates at 12 months compared to 
High -Tech & ODP . 
Hypothesis 1b:  High -Touch will result in higher health stat us at 12 months compared to 
High -Tech & ODP . 
Hypothesis 1c:  High -Tech will result in higher patient activation at 12 months compared to 
High -Touch & ODP . 
 
Primary Aim 2:  Examine the differential effects of the interventions for patient subgroups, 
based on age, race, illness complexity, and comorbid behavioral health conditions to evaluate 
heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) and determine for whom and under  what 
circumstances the interventions are most effective.  
Hypothesis 2a:  For all primary outcomes , High -Touch will have greater positive impact than 
High -Tech & ODP  for older participants (60 years or more) and for participants with 
comorbid behavioral health conditions.  
 
Primary Aim 3:  Examine perceived barriers and facilitators to efficient and effective 
implementation of High -Touch and High -Tech interventions for delivering evidence -based 
integrated care.  
Interventions Compared  
High -Touch . This approach leverages a personalized service design that includes payer -
employed registered nurses and so cial workers to provide intensive, in -person /telephonic  
support and resources for eligible participants in their homes and/or communities for  a 
minimum of four months following initial engagement. The health plan -based  CT will focus on 
addressing the full range of health determinants that can impact an individual’s health and 
health care and support information sharing with patients and providers through intervention 
that do  not require access to mobile devices or the Internet.  
High -Tech . By leveraging telehealth and remote monitoring technology to support self -
directed care management in real time , this approach uses less in -person resources. CT will 
focus on address ing the full range of health determinants  that can impact an individual’s hea lth 
and health care through  innovative approaches including  virtual visits  and access to mobile 
communications/ applications for managing individual health and health care. 42,43  42,43  42,43 
Optimal Discharge Planning (ODP) . Prior to the use of High -Touch and High -Tech 
interventions within our payer environment, all members with MCC who were hospitalized and 
at risk for rehospitalization were supported through the UPMC Health Plan’s optimal discharge 
planning program, consider ed to be ODP  for this study’s purposes . After initial engagement  via 
a phone call to the member , a Care Manager from the CT will have a n in-home  or telephonic  
visit with each individual to provide evidence -based support, including : detailed disease 
management and medication education; confirmation of and connection to family/caregiver 
support and resources;  scheduling an ambulatory follow -up appointment; and a hand -off to a 
health plan -based telephonic c are manager , as needed.

 Study Design/Methodology  
We have chosen an individual -level randomized design along with a pragmatic, mixed -methods 
approach to compare three integrated care approaches, High -Touch  (in-person /telephonic  
supported) , High -Tech  (technology -supported) and ODP  for Medicaid or dual -eligible adult 
members with MCC who reside in in Western, Central, or Eastern P ennsylvania (P A) and are at 
high risk for  high utilization , including rehospitalization.  
Quantitative data will be collected from several sources. Self -report data will be gathered 
at baseline and three additional timepoints (3 -, 6-, 12-months)  using REDCap Cloud , a secure 
data collection platform. Claims/administrative data  will be collected from UPMC Insurance 
Services Division (UPMC ISD) to inform  several outcomes and covariates. Claims d ata will be 
extracted at six months  and 12 months  to characterize participant service use through each 
participant’s enrollment period, allowing for one full year of service -use observation.  
Qualitative telephonic interviews will be conducted with a sample of participants and  CT 
staff to examine perceiv ed barriers and facilitators to efficient and effective implementation of 
the High -Touch and High -Tech approaches for delivering evidence -based integrated care  at 
three tim epoints (Participants: b aseline, 3 -, and 12-months; CT Staff: baseline, mid- and end-
implementation period).  
Randomization Procedure  
The study will use web -based randomization to one of the three care strategies  for those 
individuals who consent to participate in the study. The consent process may take place face -
to-face with an eligible individual, or over the phone, providing that the individual consenting 
has received a paper or electronic copy of the consent form and enrollment materials to 
review. Once a member of the CT staff determines the individual’s eligibility, they  will enter in 
key identification information,  independently or with support of the research team,  and the 
system will then generate a Study ID (numeric identification number) . A research team member 
will verify eligibility and the accuracy of the information entered with the CT staff and enrollee, 
and then the REDCap Cloud system will provide an  assignment to an intervention arm. 
Randomization will be stratified by gender, type of insurance (Medicaid or M edicare -Medicaid), 
and technology/digital literacy, which will be assessed at time of enrollment and before 
randomization, to ensure that intervention arms are balanced with respect to these important 
variables. Within each stratum, random block sizes of 5 and 10 will be used to maximize 
balance between intervention groups while minimizing the ability to unmask investigators to 
the next treatment assignment, triggering an automated alert to CT staff regarding which 
intervention  (care strategy)  to implement for each participant and documented accordingly in 
HealthPlaNET, UPMC ISD’s integrated health management software program. If a participant is 
unwilling  to be randomized, they will be excluded from the study.  
Measures  
Process Measures  
Participant  and payer care team staff perceptions/experience  will be assessed via telephonic 
qualitative interviews with a sample of participants and CT staff to examine perceived barriers 
7 
 and facilitators to efficient and effective implementation of High -Touch and High -Tech and to 
identify strategies for intervention improvement/tailoring and dissemination.  
 
Primary Outcome Measures  
Patient activation  will be assessed using the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), a 13 -item scale 
that gauges individual knowledge, skills, an d confidence essential to managing one’s own 
health.44 In consideration of “straight -lined” answers in the PAM measure, (i.e., all 13 questions 
answered with “strongly disagree”), we plan to  include  all participant responses and conduct a 
sensitivity analysis. This is recommended by our study investigative tea m, including our Patient 
Partner Co -investigator.   
 
Health status  will be measured using the Health Survey (SF -36), a 36 -item scale measuring 
functional health and well -being within eight domains, including physical functioning, physical 
ability to comple te tasks, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional 
ability to complete tasks, and mental health.45 
 
Subsequent  90-day rehospitalization  will be measured using an al l-cause readmission rate 
existing in  UPMC ISD inpatient claims for physical and behavioral health service use within 90 
days  of the last hospital discharge prior to study enrollment . All-cause readmission does not 
include observation visits.  
 
Secondary Outcome Measures  
Subsequent  rehospitalization  will be measured using an all -cause readmission rate existing in  
UPMC ISD inpatient claims for physical and behavioral health service use w ithin 30 days and 
again at 12 months , following the index inpatient admission.  Inpatient and ED visits that were 
adjudicated  and reclassified as Observation visits wil l be separately explored  at 12 months.  
 
Functional status  will be measured using the PROMIS Physical Functional Form – Short For 6b 
which is a brief self -report tool that assesses functional impairment in everyday tasks, 
household chores, and walking using a 5 point Likert scale.46  
 
Quality of life  will be measured using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction 
Questionnaire (Q -LES-Q-18), which is an  18-item, self -administered questionnaire monit oring 
enjoyment in several domains (physical health, subjective feelings, leisure time activities, social 
relationships).47 
 
Care satisfaction  will be measured using the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC), 
a 20 -item survey designed to provide an assessment of important aspects of care for chronic 
illness patients, including specific actions or qualities of care that patients repo rt experiencing 
in the service delivery system and their satisfaction level.48 
 
Emergent care use  will be measured using existing behavioral and physical health claims data 
from the UPMC ISD data warehouse determining participant frequency of emergent service use 
over 12 months.  
8 
 Engagement in primary, specialty, men tal health care  will be measured using existing 
behavioral and physical health claims data from the UPMC ISD data warehouse determining  
participant frequency of non -acute visits for participants over 12 months.  
 
Gaps in care will be assessed using Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS ) 
quality metrics that will be compiled using existing behavioral and physical health claims data 
from the UPMC ISD data warehouse. Gaps in care will be assessed for six of the most common 
chronic diseases present among our target population, including: asthma, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and 
depression.49 
 
Covariates  
Engagement in interventions  will be assessed using the automatically generated usage statistics 
and administrative/ utilization data routinely collected  for non -research purposes as part of 
insurance claims processing and existing payer -provider service delivery.  
 
Patient characteri stics  will be obtained through self-report data and existing secondary 
administrative data on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and insurance type.  
 
Technology/digital literacy  will be measured using a series of questions from the Health  
Information National Tr ends Survey  (HINTS)  to assess comfort and experience with use of 
different . communication channels, including the Internet, to obtain vital health information for 
themselves  and their loved ones.  
 
Social support  will be measured using the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL), a 12 -item 
measure designed to assess the perceived availability of three  types of social support 
(appraisal‚ belonging‚ and tangible).50 
 
Health literacy  will be measured using the first ten items of the All Aspects of Health Literacy 
Scale (AAHLS), a 13 -item survey designed to assess functional, communicative, and critical 
health literacy.51 The final three items on the AAHLS are part of an ‘empowerment scale’ that is 
not related to the outcomes of this study.  
 
Illness complexity  will be measured using the age -adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) 
which was developed as a prognostic burde n of comorbid disease and is currently used by the 
UPMC ISD.52 A score will be computed at baseline based on the previous 12 months of claims, 
adding assigned weights for specific diseases as classified by using International Classification of 
Diseases  (ICD) diagnoses on claims records, and age adjusting by adding 1 point for every 
decade over 40 to the CCI score.52 
 
Socioeconomic status  will be measured using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), which uses 17 
different socioeconomic indicators to determine a deprivation score for a given neighborhood. 
Scores are reported in the form of quintiles, with a higher quintile indicating a higher d egree of 
deprivation.53-55

Statistical Analysis Plan  
Sample Size and Power Calculations  
We will evaluate , based on a 20 % attrition rate , a total of 1,120 participants at 12 -month post -
enrollment data collection time point, which will be the main time point for the comparison of 
primary outcomes. We will use  a randomization ratio of 2:2:1  (High -Touch; High -Tech; ODP , 
respectively)  and, as such, estimate fina l sample sizes of n=448 for each active care strategy and 
n=224 for the ODP  strategy . All calculations for the power estimates were done in PASS version 
13. For the primary test for the trial, the power calculation is based on the comparison of the 
two primary  care strategies (High -Touch and High -Tech) for the main outcome of hospital 
readmissions between the strategies, using a two -sample test of proportions; specifically we 
have 80% power to detect a difference between a readmission rate of 20% in the High -Touch 
care strategy  versus 28% in the High -Tech care strategy .21,57,58 Additionally,  for the overall 
differences between the three care strategies the given sample sizes yield 95% power ; based on 
a chi -squared test.  
10 
 For the additional primary outcomes of health status (SF -36)45 and patient activation 
(PAM)59, power estimates are based on a two -sample  t-test for comparing High -Touch and 
High -Tech and  using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for an overall difference across the three 
arms. For SF -36 scores, we hypothesized mean increases of 11, 5 and 0 points in High -Touch, 
High -Tech and ODP , respectively,  with a standard deviation of 10 in each arm  or care 
strategy .60-63 This yielded over 99% power for the test between the two active interventions 
(e.g. High -Touch and High -Tech), assuming  a 5-point increase for the High -Tech group would 
yield 80% power for detecting a difference as small as 1.7 , which is a small effect size of 0.17. 
The hypothesized mean increases also yield >99% power for the overall test of mean 
differences across interv entions and yield >90% for means as close as 5.6, 5.0 and 4.4. For PAM 
scores, we hypothesized mean increases of 4, 8 and 0.5 points in High -Touch, High -Tech and 
ODP , respectively, with a standard deviation of 20.9 in each arm.44,64 This difference, which 
corresponds to a small effect size of 0.19 yielded 82% power for the test between the two 
active intervention  groups ( e.g. High -Touch and High -Tech). The hypothesized mean increases 
also yield >99% power for the overall test of m ean differences across the groups and yield >80% 
for means as close as 6.5, 8 and 6.  
For the tests of interactions, we have identified, a priori, eight subgroups of interest : those 
aged 60 years and above , constituting 23% of the sample, and those aged bel ow 60; race with 
non-white participants constituting 38% of the sample ( n=203 High -Touch/High -Tech, n=100 
ODP ), and white participants; Charlson Comorbidity  Index  Score of five or above, indicating 
higher illness complexity includes 54% of the sample  versus lower illness complexity ; and 
positive  (opposed to negative)  for comorbid behavioral health conditions  for 60% of the 
sample . We are only presenting power analysis results for the treatment by age interactions 
since we do not have any a -priori hypothese s about the direction of differential effects for 
treatment by race, treatment by illness complexity, or treatment by comorbid behavioral health 
condition . All such interactions will therefore be labeled as purely exploratory in subsequent 
findings and pub lications. Power estimates for interactions were calculated based on a 2 -way 
factorial design and the average sample size across groups. For readmission rates, we used a 
normal approximation to estimate the standard deviation and appl ied a 2-way ANOVA as 
similar procedures are not available for dichotomous outcomes without approximating as 
normal.  
For age by treatment interactions, readmission rates are hypothesized to increase in older 
age groups, with greater differences in the treatment effects. We also hypothesize d that the 
intervention groups will yield similar rates in the younger group while High -Tech will be closer 
to ODP  in the older group.65 More specifically, we have 79.8 % power to detect a significant 
interaction with readmission rates of 22 %, 40%, and 42% in the older group (for High -Touch, 
High -Tech, and ODP , respectively) and rates of 18 %, 16% and 28% in the younger group. For 
PAM scores, we hypothesized that, in the older group, the interventions will work equally well 
and much more effectively  than ODP , whereas, in the younger group, High -Tech will be most 
effective, with High -Touch and ODP  showing no effect on PAM scores.66 More specifically, we 
have 72.2 % power to detect a significant interaction with mean increases in PAM of 8, 8, and 1 
in the older group for High -Touch, High -Tech, and ODP , respectively , and mean i ncreases of 0, 8 
and 0 in the younger group. For SF -36 scores, we assumed a greater overall effect for High -
Touch and a greater effect in younger ages and a slightly larger difference between ages for the 
11 
 High -Touch group.67 Specifically, we have 99 .5% power to detect a significant interaction with 
mean increases in SF -36 of 7, 2, and 0 in the older group for High -Touch, High -Tech, and ODP , 
respectively , and mean increases of 15, 8, and 1 in the younger group.  
 
Quantitative Analysis  
We will conduct descriptive analyses and multivariate modeling of patient self -report and 
administrative data to examine changes in outcomes over time and explore moderating 
variables. If any additional analyses are identified during  the study, they will c learly be labeled 
as post -hoc comparisons and interpreted as such . 
Primary outcomes will be  analyzed using both self -report and claims data. As such, loss to 
follow -up for a participant will be calculated at the point which they no longer complete their 
self- report questionnaires for a given timepoint and they are no longer Medicaid/Medicare -
Medicaid eligible, as determined by the proxy of 9 months of Medicaid/Medicaid -Medicare 
coverage in the 12 -month period prior to the data collection timepoint. Whichev er comes last is 
the point at which the participant is lost to follow -up. No surveys are collected during 
Timepoint 2, and as such, loss to follow -up will be calculated at the point which they are no 
longer Medicaid/Medicare -Medicaid eligible, as determine d by our proxy described above.  
All inferential modeling will be preceded by descriptive analyses of baseline and outcome 
measures. Summary statistics will include the mean and standard deviation, and the median 
and range for continuous variables, and the frequency and percentage for each categorical 
variable. Results will be presented for the entire sample and stratified by intervention arm. We 
will also statistically assess the balance of key covariates across the interventions via analysis of 
variance fo r continuous measures and chi -squared tests for categorical measures. For 
continuous variables which are assumed to be normal, we will visually assess the univariate 
distribution via a normal probability plot to determine departure from normality and the 
bivariate correlations between pairs of covariates to assess collinearity; appropriate diagnostics 
for collinearity and model fit of the regression models described below will also be checked in 
each analysis. Transformations will be implemented if required , although slight to moderate 
departures from normality will not be problematic with the large sample sizes.  
Our models will be based on an intent -to-treat principle as we do not expect large drop out 
or non -adherence. We will employ  linear regression mode ls for continuous outcomes, logistic 
regression for dichotomous outcomes, and Poisson regression or negative binomial models (in 
the case of over -inflated variance) for count outcomes. We  will fit multivariate models with the 
key independent variable of in terest being the main effect of treatment with main effects for 
additional covariates included to produce an adjusted estimate of the treatment effect. These 
covariates  will be defined a priori and will be divided into two subgroups. The first set of 
clinically -important covariates will be included in all models including age, race, gender, 
insurance type, illness complexity, and socio -economic status. The second set of covariates will 
be defined as engagement in interventions, social support, health litera cy, and technology 
literacy. To address Aim 2, separate models will be fit for each a priori defined heterogeneity of 
treatment group  (HTE) subgroup of interest. As listed below, we will test the interaction of 
treatment with the covariate defining the HTE  subgroup.  
The objective of Aim 2 is to determine whether the intervention works better for some than 
for others. Our pre -specified analysis plan will examine differences in main outcomes for 
12 
 several subgroups. These subgroups  are determined by our stakeholders to be  most relevant so 
that end results can meaningfully inform patients about what works best for whom, and in turn, 
better support s individuals with MCC as they navigate the health care system  and make 
decisions about their care . Furthermore, in examining differential impact of the interventions 
based on these subgroups, providers, payers, and other decision makers can target resources in 
a manner that best meets the needs of those in services, reduce s variations in practice, and 
improve s health o utcomes.  
We are only powering for the interactions with age, since we do not have any a -priori 
hypotheses about subgroup effects for the other variables. Those additional subgroups will 
clearly be labeled as exploratory and will only be examined further if  the overall analysis is 
significant. We will conduct modeling as defined above to examine the HTE and will utilize 
contrasts from these regression models to make inferences about the heterogeneity. We will 
present both the treatment effect estimates, in t erms of estimated odds or risk ratios for 
dichotomous or rate outcomes or the model coefficients for the continuous outcomes and 
measures of their variability in the form of confidence intervals. Two -sided tests of level 0.05 of 
the interactions between in tervention and HTE subgroup will allow us to test the Aim 2 
hypotheses.  
For all the described models, we will focus on the 12-month  outcome. Each of the above 
analyses will also be repeated using all follow -up outcomes collected as a secondary analysis 
using a mixed model with a random intercept to account for within -subject repeated measures 
and associated correlation. Significance tests from all regression models will all be assessed 
using likelihood ratio tests for logistic, Poisson, or, if applicable, negative binomial models or 
partial F -tests for linear regression.  
Additionally, exploratory data analyses will include comparison of the following variables in 
the pre - versus post -COVID -19 time periods: a) demographics and primary outcomes at 
baseline, b ) the primary outcomes over time, and c) patterns in missing data. If significant 
differences result, we will repeat the primary analysis by: a) adjusting for the demographic 
variables that can describe pre - and post -COVID -19 participants, b) include indic ator variables 
for post -COVID -19 enrollment with and without interactions with time variables, and c) 
statistically account for missing patterns.  
Qualitative Analysis  
Codebook construction will follow standard editing methods.68 Separate codebooks for patients 
and staff interviews will be constructed after completion of the first set of interviews. A system 
of audit trails will be employed to document creation of codes during the iterative process of 
codebook development. Two tra ined  independent analysts  from the Qualitative, Evaluation and 
Stakeholder Engagement (Qual EASE) Research Core  will code the interviews in Atlas.ti, 
qualitative analysis software. A manual will be created to outline information about each code 
in the code book. After each transcript is coded, coders will meet to process and adjudicate 
differences until agreement is achieved. Codes determined through this process will be 
recorded in a master file to be used in final analysis. Once all transcripts are coded, Cohen’s 
Kappa scores will be calculated to assess inter -coder reliability with the goal of achieving 
reliability of >0.75 which exceeds substantial coder agreement.69 
13 
 For each qualitative cohort and for each wave of data collection, a final report will be 
created. We will examine key topics in the interview guides to better understand barriers and 
facilitators to intervention implementation and success and how interventions impact patients’ 
ability to manage t heir chronic conditions. In addition, for each subsequent wave of data 
collection, we will examine changes and consistency across the waves. Final reports will be 
shared with stakeholder teams to ensure ongoing intervention improvements and aid in 
interpre tation of findings.  
Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent can be obtained either telephonically or  obtained during the first in -home 
visit using a web -based platform , at the participant’s home or a preferred location within the 
community. For telephoni c consents, the care manager will provide the participant with a copy 
of the consent form and study FAQs to review prior to enrollment. CT staff, who have 
completed the University of  Pittsburgh Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) human 
subjects research training  through the Collaborative Institutional Training Institute (CITI) , will 
assist the participant in navigating  the web -based consent process , with support provided by 
the research team . The web -based consent process will provid e subjects wi th a clear 
explanation of the objectives, procedures, risks and benefits of the study,  a frequently asked 
questions page and their rights as study participants . Research Team members will be available 
via the telephone to answer all questions related to th e informed consent process and the 
study prior to the member consenting to participation. Consent w ill be  obtained only from the 
participant. Consent will also be required for participation in the qualitative interviews.  
Participants will retain  their righ t to have their questions answered by the Principal  
Investigator  or a member of the Research Team  via telephone or an appointment for an in -
home visit . The Research Team  believe s that informed consent is an ongoing process in any 
study  and so will continue to educate participants about the nature of the research and will 
address any questions that ar ise throughout the course of the study.  These efforts will comply 
fully with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the inf ormed 
consent guidelines of the University of Pittsburgh’s HRPO.  
Privacy and C onfidentiality  
Self-report and qualitative data collected for this study will be used for research purposes only. 
Access to the data will be restricted to the Principal  Investiga tor, Co -Investigators , and other 
Research T eam members trained in UPMC and University of Pittsburgh HRPO Human Subject 
Research Training requirements. Research staff will sign confidentiality agreements as required. 
Identifying links to all data will be maintained at baseline and other data collection time points 
using a secure password -protected server, accessible only by authorized members of the study 
team. Once the data is collected, the file containing the link be tween identifying information 
and the participant's data will be destroyed.  
Qualitative data will be audio recorded using digital recording devices, transferred to a 
secure server immediately following recording and deleted as soon as it is fully transcrib ed. 
Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and scrubbed of identifying information. 
14 
 Participants will be asked not to include any identifying information in their responses, and 
coders will not code any identifying information that may be provided  inadvertently.  
All data obtained over the course of the study will be confidential and secure. Paper study 
records will be secured using the “double -lock” method (i.e., in a locked cabinet within a locked 
office). Data stored on computers will be password protected and s tored on a secure server 
behind the organization’s firewall. Each Research T eam member has a unique network account 
and a secure password that complies with existing UPMC policies and procedures. Only 
members of the team who are authorized by the Principal  Investigator will have access to the 
secured files. Identities of participants will not be revealed in the publication or presentation of 
any results from this study.  
Risk/Benefit  
Risk to Participants  
There is no known serious health or psychological risk  of participating in this study. Some of the 
items in the self -report measures that ask respondents about their health, attitudes, and 
experiences could be considered sensitive. However, participants can refuse to answer 
questions at any time, which will b e made clear during the consenting procedures and at the 
time of administration of all research measures and interviews. Minimal risks of study 
participation may still apply, such as participants feeling inconvenienced by the assessment 
requirements and/or  uncomfortable when responding to surveys or interviews. As with all 
research involving personal health information (PHI), there is also a potential risk of a breach of 
confidentiality for all study participants. However, safeguards will be in place to fully decrease 
this risk. Currently, there are no known risks associated with involvement in the study 
interventions, other than possible emotional discomfort associated with the discussion of issues 
related to complex health conditions. In instances where  participants appear to be unduly 
distressed about health or other issues in their interactions during the interventions, they will 
be advised to speak directly with Dr. Dan Swayze , Principal Investigator .  
Benefits to Participants   
There is a high likelih ood that all study participants will benefit from the evidence -based 
components of integrated care delivered through study interventions. Moreover, greater 
knowledge about the comparative effectiveness of the interventions  or care strategies  and 
their impa ct on patient -centered outcomes will eventually benefit all patients with  MCC. For 
these reasons, the Research Team notes that the potential benefits of the knowledge to be 
gained from the proposed study outweigh the minimal risks posed to participants.  
Compensation for Participation  
Total possible compensation for the entire study:  $190  
  
Timepoint 1: $20  for baseline self -report measures  
Timepoint 2: $20  for 3 -month self -report measures  
Timepoint 3: $20  for 6 -month self -report measures  
15 
 Timepoint 4: $40  for 12 -month self -report measures  
 
Timepoint 1: $30  for baseline interview  
Timepoint 2: $30  for 3 -month interview  
Timepoint 3: $30  for 12 -month interview  
Data Safety Monitoring  
Dr. Dan Swayze  (Principal  Investigator ) and Dr. Kevin Kraemer (Co -Investigator) will be 
responsible for data and safety monitoring. They  will meet with the Research T eam to review 
all data protocols and policies, including informed consent and data confidentiality procedu res. 
All key personnel will adhere to the National Institutes of Health policy on education in the 
protection of human subject participants in the conduct of research. Additionally, we will 
convene biannual Data Safety and Monitoring Board meetings to ensu re any issues related to 
participant or data safety are fully vetted and addressed. The Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
will sunset  in Spring 2022 , after all enrollment goals are met. This decision follows the 
recommendation of the board chair and approval of the PCORI program officer, given the 
limited time remaining in the study implementation phase and the l ow-risk nature of the 
intervention.  
Conflict of Interest  
The study investigators report having no conflicts of interest or financial interest s related to the 
research conducted under this contract.  
Publication and Presentation Plans  
We will form a Stakeholder Dissemination Committee in Year 2  of the study. The committee will 
include  members from the Stakeholder Advisory Board  and the Pa tient P artners Work Group , 
and the committee  will meet biannually to aid in the development and execution of novel 
dissemination practices.  Committee members will provide a diversity of perspectives in terms 
of organizational, geographic, and system backgrounds.

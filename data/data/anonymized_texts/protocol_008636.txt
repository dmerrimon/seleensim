A serious deterioration in the health of the subject that 
either resulted in:
a.a life -threatening illness or injury .
Note: Life -threatening means that the 
individual was at immediate risk of death fr om 
the event as it occurr ed, ie, it does not include 
an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death had it occurr ed in a mor e sever e 
form.

acuity  as specified in the inclusion criteria, will then be randomized in a 1:1 manner to either 
receive  or Biofinity  lenses for use throughout the duration of the study .
Following randomization ,study  lenses will be dispensed to the subject. Subjects will be 
provided with suf
ficient lens supplies to follow a weekl y replacement schedule u ntil the next 
visit.
All subjects will wear the study  lenses in an extended wear modality , while awake and asleep 
for up to 
6 nights/ 7 day s of continuous wear with one night of no lens wear . This wearing 
schedule will be repeated throughout the course of the trial. Subjects assigned to  or 
Biofinity  contact lenses will insert a new pair of study  lenses each week and di scard them at 
the end of the week .
Problem lenses (if an y) will not be discarded but collected b y the subject and returned to the 
investigational site. Regardless of whet her the subject is randomized to the test or the control 
group, CLEAR CARE®Cleaning & Disinfecting Solution (CL EAR CARE) and Menicon

productsTest Product : soft contact lens
Control Product : Biofinity soft contact lens
Purpose and
rationaleThe purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safet y and 
performance of the  soft contact lens compared to the 
commerciall yavailable Biofinity soft contact lens, by  assessing
ocular serious and significant non- serious adverse dev ice ef fects as 
the primary  safet y variable and visual acuit y as the primary
effectiveness variable.
Objective(s) The objective of this study  is to demonstrate safet y and 
effectiveness of  soft contact lens esas compared to 
Biofinity  soft contact lenses, when both study  lenses are worn for 
extended wear (6 nights/7 day s of continuous wear followed by  
1night of no lens wear ) and replaced on a weekl y basis .

Key inclusion 
criteria
(See Section 8.1 for a 
complete list of 
inclusion criteria)Successful wear of spherical daily  wear or extended wear 
frequent replacement soft contact lenses in both eyes 
during the past 3 months for a minimum of 5 day s per 
week. Habitual daily  or extended wear subjects must have 
regularl y worntheir lenses for at least 10 hours per day .
Additionally , extended wear lens wearers must have 
regularl y worn their lenses for a minimum of 1 night 
per 
week. 
Manifest cy linder ≤ 0.75 D in each ey e.
 
 
Key exclusion 
criteria
(See Section 8.2 for a 
complete list of 
exclusion criteria)Currently  pregnant or breast -feeding
Monovision contact lens wearers
Data analysis and 
sample size 
justificationIn adherence to the reporting format as specified in the I SO 
clinical standard andFDA 510(k) guidance documents, 
effectiveness and safet y data of the primary  cohort will be 
presented separatel y based upon subject study status ofCompleted 
or Discontinued.
The primary  safet y analysis is to assess noninferiority of  
contact lenses when compared to Biofinity  contact lenses for the 
proportion of ocular serious and significant non- serious ADEs, 
with a pre -defined margin of 0 .05 (5%) . A generalized linear 
model with a logit link function will be used , and a one-sided 95% 
upper confidence limit (UCL ) will be calculated for the dif ference 
in proportions between treatments (  minus B iofinity ).

No formal h ypotheses are formulated for the primary  effectiveness
endpoint of distance VA; hence, no inferential testing will be 
performed. Descriptive summary  statistics will be provided for the 
Snellen categories as well as the converted logMAR values. 
The s ample size calculation was based on previous extended wear 
clinical studies which evaluated five currently  marketed silicone 
hydrogel lenses. Assuming that the expected d ifference between 
test and control is 0 and that the control proportion is 0.045, a 
sample size of 213 per group will provide 80% power to reject the 
null hy pothesis of inferiority  in test compared to control, with a 
noninferiority  margin of 0.05 (5%).
Key words  Biofinity , extended wear
Associated materials CLEAR CARE and LacriPure ( or equivalent )will be permitted if 
the subject must remove the irlens(es)for an y reason. Sy stane will 
be also be permitted but should only  be used if necessary .

At the end of the study , a clinical study  report will be prepared in accordance with applicable 
regulatory  requirements and standards.
5.3 Risk s and Benefits
Contac t lenses may  offer improved peripheral vision and the convenience of not wearing 
spectacles. Biofinit y contact lenses are approved for extended wear for up to 6 nights/7 day s 
of continuous wear . Further details on any  known potential risks and benefits can be found in 
the package insert.
Material properties and design characteristics of the investigational (not approved b y the 
FDA)  contact lenses are consistent with successful contact lens wear . To date, 
supportive results from preclinical tests anddocumented rationale for applicability  of test 
results , and the previous clinical studies, described in the IB, provide a basis for the 
anticipated acceptable performance and safet y profile of the  contact lenses for up to 
6 continuous nights of ex tended wear with planned weekl y replacement in the upcoming 
12-month registration study . This study will evaluate an y long term or new risks with the 
extended wear of  contact lenses and how these risks compare to a marketed 
extended wear control lens. A summary  of the known and potential risks and benefits 
associated with  contact lenses ispresented in the IB. The potential harms associated 
with on
-eye exposure to the new lens materials include toxicity  response, blurred vision, and 
ocular discomfort.
Under the conditions of a clinical study , which incl ude compliance with subject selection 
criteria, oversight by  study  Investigators, adequate informed consent, subject instructions, 
scheduled lens wear/replacement, and frequent follow -up visits, risks to study  subjects are 
controlled and minimized. Site pe rsonnel will educate subjects on proper hygiene and lens 
handling, and compliance with the use of contact lenses according to the protocol. Subjects 
should be instructed not to wear contact lenses while swimming due to increased risk of 
infection. Site per sonnel should advise the subjects to remove contact lenses and return for 
prompt follow -up of s ymptoms such as ocular discomfort, foreign bod y sensation, excessive 
tearing, vision changes, or hy peremia.
Refer to the IB for additional information.

Sites will be identified and notified prior to study  start.
Subje cts will be expected to attend 9 of fice visits: Baseline /Dispense , 24-hour follow - up, 
1-week follow - up, 1 -month follow -up, 2- month follow - up, 3- month follow - up, 6- month 
follow up
, 9-month follow -up and 12- month follow -up/Exit. The total expected duration of 
participa tion for each subject is approximately  12 months in this extended wear study . 
Subjects will be randomized to wear either the test  contact lenses in both ey es or the 
control Biofinity  contact lenses in both ey es.
Following randomization, study  lense s will be dispensed to the subject. Subjects will be 
provided with suf
ficient lens supplies to follow a weekl y replacement schedule until the next 
scheduled visit .
Subjects will wear the lenses while awake and asleep for up to 6 nights/ 7days of continuous
wear in an extended wear modality . CLEAR CARE and LacriPure ( or equivalent ) will be 
permitted if the subject must remove the irlens(es)for an y reason. S ystane will be also 
permitted but should only  be used if necessary and is the only  product permitted f or use in the

9.5 Accountability Procedures
Upon receipt of the IPs, the Investigator or delegate must conduct an inventory . Dur ing the 
study , unmasked designated study  staff must provide the I Ps to the subjects in accordance 
with their randomization assignment . Throughout the study , the 
unmasked designated study  
staffmust maintain records of I P dispensation and collection for each subject. This record 
must be made available to the study  monitor for the purposes of verify ing the accounting of 
IP supplies. Any discrepancies and/or deficiencies between the observed dispo sition and the 
written account must be recorded along with an explanation. All IPs sent to the I nvestigator 
must be accounted for b y Study  Sponsor personnel, and in no case be used in an unauthorized 
situation.
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility  to ensure that:
All study  products are accounted for and not used in any  unauthorized manner
All used foils and unused supplies are returned b y each subject
All unused products are available for return to the Study  Sponsor , as directed
Any study  lenses associat ed with a device deficiency  or with any  product - related AE
(ie, ADE or SADE) are returned to the Study  Sponsor for investigation, unless 
otherwise directed b y the S ponsor. Refer to Section 11 of this protocol for additional 
information on the reporting of device deficiencies and AEs and the return of study  
products associated with these events.
Every  effort should be made to return opened and unopened investigational lenses 
from those subjects lost to follow-up.
All supplies are to be retrieved from the sub ject at the final visit. If a subject misses the 
final visit, all efforts MUST be made to reschedule the final visit provided it is 
scheduled within the visit window.
The Investigator is responsible for proper disposition of all unused I Ps at the conclusio
n of 
the study , according to the instructions provided in the MOP .

The Sponsor will send study  lenses for e ach subject to the site after receiving an order from 
the Investigator .The Investigator will complete the order forms as and when needed to 
provide a consistent stream of lens supply  for each subject enrolled in this clinical study . 
At the Baseline /Dispense Visit, study  lenses will be dispensed to the subject. All subjects will 
wear the stud y lenses in an extended wear modality , while awake and asleep for up to 
6nights/ 7 day s of continuous wear w ith one night of no lens wear . This wearing schedule 
will be repeated throughout the course of the trial. The wearing schedule assignment for 
either test or control lens should be preserved as much as possible unless there are safet y 
reasons that necessitate a modification to the wearing schedule assignment.
Subjects assigned to wearing  or Biofinity  contact lenses will insert a new pair of 
study  lenses each week and discard them at the end of the week. Problem lenses (if an y) will 
not be discarded but collected b y the subject and returned to the investigational site.  
 
VA 
will be measured at all visits, and any  decrease of 2 ormore lines from the Baseline /Dispense
Visit to any  follow -up visit should be explained by  theInvestigator . Keratometry  will be 
performed at the Baseline /Dispense
, 6-Month, and Exit Visits, and manifest refraction will be 
performed at the Baseline /Dispense and Exit Visits.

discretion [ as described in the MOP; and documented in the narrative section(s) of the 
corresponding ADE -SAE eCRF ], for an y suspected ocular infection, including infiltrates with 
overly ing epithelial defect.
Significant Non -Serious Adverse Events
A significant non -serious AE is a device -related, non -sight threatening AE that warrants 
discontinuation of any contact lens wear for greater than or equal to 2 weeks. I n addition, the 
Investigator must report any  occurrence of the following as a Significant Non -Serious 
Adverse Event:
Peripheral non -progressive non
-infectious ulcers
All sy mptomatic corneal infiltrative events
Corneal st aining score greater than or equal to Grade 3 (Refer to MOP  for grading 
scales)

scales) 
The above events ar e based upon the categories pr ovided in ISO 1 1980 and the US FDA  
Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily W ear Contact Lenses.
Device Deficiencies
A device deficiency  is inadequacy  of a medical device with respect to its identity , quality , 
durability , reliability , safety , or performance. A device deficiency  may  or may  not be 
associated with subject harm (ie, ADE or SADE); however , not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficie ncy. The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the

Device Deficiency  eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency  and report an y 
subject harm separatel y. Examples of device deficiencies include the following: 
Failure to m eet product specifications (eg, incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)
Lens cloud y
Lens surface/edge defect 
Torn lens during handling/in pack
Packaging deficit (eg, mislabeled product)
Suspect product contamination
Lack of performance
11.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity  to spontaneousl y mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by  asking the standard questions:
“Have you had an y health problems since your last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
Changes in any pr otocol -specific parameters and/or questionnair es evaluated during the 
study  are to be reviewed by  the Investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and unintended) 
change in a pr otocol -specific parameter or questionnair e response that is clinically  relevant, 
in the opinion of the I nvestigator , is to be reporte d as an AE. These clinically  relevant 
changes will be reported regardless of causality . 
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent. Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study  (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the Medical 
History  section of the eCRF .
In addition, temporary  lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting proces s are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the sy mptom(s) can reasonably  resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.

ADEs or SAEs are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .
Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .
A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device De ficiency eCRF must be included with product returns.
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.
Document an y changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.
Docum ent all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy  Report, 
Certificate of Death, etc, if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event and Adverse Device Effect eCRF .
Note: Should the EDC system become non -operational, the site mu st complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device Deficiency
Form. The completed form is emailed to the Study
 Sponsor at 
according to the timelines outlined above; however, the reported in formation must be entered 
into the EDC sy stem once it becomes operational.
Additionally , any AEs and device deficiencies for non- study  marketed devices/products (ie, 
CLEAR CARE Cleaning and Disinfecting Solution, LacriPure (or equivalent ),and Systane
preservative -free eye drops) will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the 
postmarket vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the device’s/product’s 
manufacturer as per local requirements.
Study  Sponsor representatives may  be contacted for an y protocol related question ;their 
contact information is provided in the MOP that accompanies this protocol.
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copies of applicab le portions of the subject’s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.
Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appr opriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based upon 
medical judgment with consideration of an y subjective symptom(s), as defined below:
Alcon - Business Use Only   Effective Date:

Protocol - Clinical
16-Jan-2020

Page 66of 78
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolera te the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.
For every  AE in the study , the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by Study  Sponsor utilizing the same definitions, as shown below:
Causality
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related 
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the AE was caused by  the medical device or stud y procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).
The Study  Sponsor will assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that 
are upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelated to related.
Additionally , the Study  Sponsor shall immediately conduct an evaluation of any  
unanticipated adverse device effect, including anticipated adverse events that occur in 
unanticipated severity  or frequency . The results of this evalu ation will be reported to the
FDA, the IRB
,and participating Investigators within 10 working day s upon receiving 
notification of the effect.
11.4 Return product analysis
Investigational product associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs [ie , 
ADE or SADE] will be returned for investigation as detailed in the MOP .

11.5 Unmask ing of the Study Treatment
Masked information on the identity  of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the stud y. If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of subject safet y, the 
Investigator is encouraged to contact an appropriate Study  Sponsor representative prior to 
unmasking the information if there is suf ficient time. Dependent upon the individual 
circumstances (ie, medical emergency), th e code may  be broken prior to contact with the 
Study  Sponsor . The Study Sponsor must be informed of all cases in which the code was 
broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally , the Study  Sponsor may  be required 
to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory  requirements.
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator should provide the Study  Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previousl y reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any additional information received at follow-up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, database lock).
Any additional data received up to 3month safter subject discontinuation or exit must be 
documented and available upon the Study  Sponsor’s request. All complaints received after 
this time period will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket 
vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the medical device’s manufacturer as 
per local requirements, as applicable.
The Investigator should also report complaints on non -Alcon products directly  to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer’s instructions or local regulatory  requirements.
11.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study
Pregnancy  is not reportable as an AE; however , complications may  be reportable and will be 
decided on a case -by-case basis. Should a woman become pregnant during study  
participation, the pregnancy  will be documented on the Medical H istoryeCRF .

Ha: PT - PC < 0.05
where P Tand P Cdenot e the proportion of ey es reporting ocular serious and significant 
non-serious ADEs with  and Biofinity  contact lenses, respectively .
12.6.1.2 Analysis Methods
A generalized linear model, with a logit link function, accounting for within -subject 
correlation will be fit. A one-sided 95% upper confidence limit (UCL) will be calculated for 
the dif ference in proportions between treatments (  contact lens minus Biofinity
contact lens), and the null hy pothesis will be rejected if UCL < 0.05.
12.6.2 Analysis of Other Safety Endpoints
Other safety endpoints include:
AE (non -serious, non- significant)
Biomicroscop y findings
Device deficiencies
12.6.2.1 Statistical Hypotheses
No hy pothesis testing on the other safety  endpoints is planned .
12.6.2.2 Analysis Methods
Descriptive summaries (counts and percentages) for ocular and nonocular AEs will be 
presented b y Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities Preferred T erms, for Completed 
and Discontinued anal ysis sets. A listing containing details of the AEs will also be provided.
Each biomicroscop y parameter will be tabulated by its grade, on Completed and

12.7 Interim Analyses and Reporting
There are no plans to conduct an interim anal ysis and no criteria b y which the study would be 
terminated early  based upon statistical determination.
12.8 Sample Size Justification
Sample size calculation was based on extended wear clinical studies from three PMA  studies 
and one 52
-week extended wear study   
that evaluated 5currentl y marketed silicone h ydrogel 
contact lenses. The weighted average, based on sample size, on the proportion of ocular 
serious and significant non -serious ADEs obtained from these five contact lenses was 0.045. 
Therefore, assuming that the expected dif ference between test and control is 0 and that the 
control proportion is 0.045, a sample size of 213 per group will provide 80% power to reject 
the null hy pothesis of inferiority  in test compared to control, with a noninferiority  margin of 
0.05 (5%). 
Taking into consideration the exposure duration of 12 months, approximately  568 subjects 
will be randomized (284 test and 284 control) to compensate for approximately  25% drop- out 
rate.
13DATA HANDLING AND ADMINISTRA TIVE REQUIREMENTS
13.1 Subject C onfidentiality
The Investigator must ensure that the subject ’s anony mity is maintained throughout the 
course of the stud y. In particular , the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with

confidential identify ing information that corresponds to the subject numbers and in itials of 
each stud y participant. At the end of the clinical study , the Study  Sponsor will collect a copy  
of the enrollment log without any identifying subject information . All documents submitted 
to the Study  Sponsor will identify  the subjects exclusively by number and demographic 
information. No other personally  identify ing information will be transmitted to the Study  
Sponsor .
The Study  Sponsor may  release anony mized study data to external researchers for purposes 
of future research directly  related to th e stud y objectives, or future research that is bey ond the 
scope of the current study objectives. The Informed Consent Form explains this to study  
subjects. Anon ymization means that all identifiable information will be removed from the 
dataset and all links to the subjects in the study  will be removed. Anon ymization of the data 
will maintain confidentiality  of the subjects who participate in the study  so that they  cannot 
be identified b y external researchers. The anon ymized data set will contain records from all 
of the subjects in the current study , but the anonymization process might change the data set 
in some way s, so external researchers will be informed that they  might not be able to 
duplicate some o f the results from this study .
13.2 Completion of Sour ce Documents and Case Report Forms
The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that original data 
required to complete the CRFs exist and are accessible for verification by  the site monitor , 
and all discrepancies shall be appropr iately  documented via the query  resolution process. Site
monitors are appointed by the Stud y Sponsor and are independent of stud y site staf f.
If electronic records are maintained, the method of verification must be determined in
advance of starting the study . 
At a minimum, source documents include the following information for each subject:
Subject identification (name, sex, race/ethnicit y)
Documentation of subject eligibility
Date of informed consent
Dates of visits
Documentation that protocol specific procedures were performed
Results of study  parameters, as required b y the protocol

to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed fo r the purpose of verify ing that 
the data recorded on the CRF are consistent with the original source data.
Only  designated individuals at the site will complete the CRFs. The CRFs must be completed 
at regular intervals following the clinical study  visit sc hedule. I t is expected that all data 
reported have corresponding entries in the source documents. The Principal I nvestigator is 
responsible for reviewing and certify ing that the CRFs are accurate and complete. The onl y 
subject identifiers recorded on the C RFs will be subject number, and subject demographic 
information. 
13.3 Data Review and Clarifications
A review of CRF data to the subject’ s source data will be completed by  the site monitor to 
ensure completeness and accuracy . After the CRFs have been completed , additional data 
clarifications and/or additions may  be needed as a result of the data cleaning process. Data 
clarifications are documented and are part of each subject’ s CRF .
13.4 Sponsor and Monitoring Responsibilities
The Study  Sponsor will designate a moni tor to conduct the appropriate site visits at the 
appropriate intervals according to the stud y monitoring plan. The clinical investigation will 
be monitored to ensure that the rights and well -being of the subjects are protected, the 
reported data are accur ate, complete, and verifiable from the source documents, and the study  
is conducted in compliance with the current approved protocol (and amendments[s], if 
applicable), with current GCP , and with applicable regulatory  requirements.
The site may  not screen subjects or perform the informed consent process on any  subject until 
it receive sa notification from an appropriate Study Sponsor representative that the site may  
commence conducting study  activities. Monitoring will be conducted periodically  while the 
clinical study  is ongoing. Monitoring methods may  include site visits, telephone, written and 
fax correspondence. Close -out visits will take place after the last visit of the last subject at the 
site.

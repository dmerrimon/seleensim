CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Validatio n Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  1 Study Objectiv e 
This is a  confirmatory  Design Validation study to provide supportive evidence to demonstrate that the 
Apollo  lens meets  the clinical performance requirements specified in the User Requirements Design 
Inputs per D28298, DHF0122. 
Specifically, the User R equirements to be evaluated in this clinical study are : 
•Vision of Apollo  is equivalent  to Gemini
•Comfort of Apollo is equivalent  (or better)  to Gemini
•Lens fit of Apollo is equivalent to Gemini
•Lens handling of Apollo is equivalent to Gemini
•Ocular health of Apollo is equivalent to Gemini
Details of the statistical hypothesis that are required to be met in fulfilment of Validation can be found in 
Section 9.1 below .  
2 Study Design 
This will be a prospective, two -day, double- masked (investigator and subject), randomized, bilateral  
crossover study comparing the Test lens against an appropriate comparator (Control) lens. Each subject 
will wear either the Apollo lens or the Gemini/Aquiane comparator lens (Control) in a bilateral fashion for two days followed by the alternate lens for two days . The Gemini  lens is a currently marketed product 
that is representative of the state -of-the art of contact lenses.  
There will be a total of three  visits in the study as described in 7.5 below  
3 Study Devices and Comparator Products  
3.1 Contact lenses 
A summary description of the Test and Control lenses to be used in the clinical study are shown in Table 
1. The Test lens is an investigational silicone hydrogel lens , with a slight modification to a contact lens
material  and design currently approved / cleared in the EU only [riofilcon A /Acquiane]. The Control lens
is also an investigational lens, currently approved / cleared in the EU  only.
Further details regarding the investigational lens is described in the Investigator Brochure.

3.1.1  Intended Use  
In this clinical investigation, t he study lenses are intended to be used as a single use  soft contact lens.  
Single use lenses will be used for a maximum of one day of lens wear.  
3.1.2  Storage of Lenses and Lens Care Solutions  
The study materials  must be stored in a secured area. All lenses and lens care solutions should be 
stored at controlled room temperature (59 -86°F).  
3.2 Adjunct Products  
3.2.1  Contact Lens Care Products  
No contact lens care is required for this study as lenses are to be worn for a single day only.  No 
contact lens wetting drops will be used during this study.  
3.2.2  Other 
No other medical devices will be used in this study.  
4 Justification for the Study Design 
The Apollo  lens has successfully passed the preclinical biocompatibility tests as identified in the risk 
assessment document . Preliminary  safety and clinical performance of of the Apollo  lens have been 
evaluated in one  feasibility clinical stud y. Th is study is summarized in the Investigator Brochure (IB).  

Confidential  Page 9 of 44  
CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Val idation Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  A two -day crossover study is sufficient to validate the clinical performance of the lens against the User 
Requir ements. A crossover design has been chosen since it minimizes the impact of potential 
sympathetic effects between the two eyes (e.g. an uncomfortable lens in one eye may impact the 
subjective rating of the fellow eye). The study contact lenses do not alter  the physiology  of the eye and 
hence there is no carryover effect requiring a washout period. The order effect will be tested.  
The choice of comparator product was made in order to assess the clinical performance against a currently marketed product repres entative of generally accepted state of the art.  
The choice of study design was made to to demonstrate  statistical equivalence to the comparator 
(Control) lens over two days of lens wear.  A sample size determination was made of sufficient 
magnitude so as to be able to adequately test  the primary statistical hypothesis , and is shown in Section 
9.2. 
5 Benefits/Risks of Study Device(s) and Study P rocedures  
5.1 Anticipated Clinical Benefits 
There might not be direct benefits to the subjects in this study, however participation in a new study may contribute to scientific research information that may be used in the development of new contact lens products.  In addition, subjects will receive an examination of the front of their eyes and may have the opportunity to try a different type of soft contact lens and/or different lens care products at no cost to them.  
5.2 Anticipated Adverse Device Effects 
Ocular complications that may occur during the wearing of contact lenses include discomfort, dryness, 
aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vi sion.  More 
serious risks may include photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact lens -
related infections are very infrequent, the possibility does exist.  The incidence of infection due to daily -
wear soft lenses is 0.035%.1  Almo st always an infection will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed 
by 35- million Americans who currently wear contact lenses.  
Confidential  Page 10 of 44  
CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Val idation Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  5.3 Risks A ssociated with Participation in the Clinical Investigation 
This is considered a non- significant risk study based on United State Food and Drug administration 
(FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines due to the daily wear nature of the 
study. The risks associated with the investigational contact lenses have been estimated in accordance 
with ISO 14971. A synopsis of pre- clinical and prior clinical testing results are included in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. Risk controls to reduce the risk as far as possible have been implemented and any residual risks will be further mitigated through close evaluation by the investigators under this clinical protocol and communicated via informed consent.  
5.4 Risks of Clinical Procedures to be Utilized in the Study 
Routine, non -invasive procedures will be conducted in this study.  Routine clinical procedures include 
auto- refraction, auto -keratometry, visual acuity, anterior ocular health assessment, and contact lens 
fitting will be used. In addition, standard research procedures such as high magnification imaging of  the 
lens fit may be made using 35 mm or digital cameras, in vivo confocal microscopy, and/or specular microscopy.   
5.5 Possible Interactions with Concomitant Medical Treatments 
The use of contact lenses can interact with concomitant topical, ocular and/or sys temic medical 
treatments, therefore only healthy subjects who are not currently taking concomitant medical treatments will be included in this study.  Only those products approved for the use with contact lenses can be used 
according to their indication under this protocol.  
5.6 Steps That will be T aken to Control or Mitigate the Risks  
The following Information for Safety for contact lens wear during the clinical study will be reviewed with 
each subject:  
Hands should be washed and dried prior to touching the lenses for insertion or removal. If inserting the lenses yourself, they should be checked for tears and/or whether they are inside out prior to insertion.   Eye rubbing should be avoided. Contact lenses should never be worn while swimming 
or in any other haza rdous environment.  The contact lenses are not to be slept in during the study 
or worn overnight and are to be replaced with a new pair according to the study lens wear schedule.

CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Val idation Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  5.7 Rationale for Benefit -Risk Ratio 
The knowledge gained from this confirmator y Validation study may lead to important conclusions 
regarding the ocular response and performance of new contact lens materials and designs. The potential 
risks for participating in this study are minimal, therefore the benefit -risk ratio is acceptable.

8 Adverse Event s and Device Deficiencies  
8.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is considered 
to be device -related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated adverse device 
effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant  adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant adverse events,’ as 
defined below.

16 Any temporary loss of ≥ 2 lines BSCVA for ≥ 2wks  
17 Any sign and/or symptom for which subject is administered ther apeutic 
treatment or which necessitates discontinuation of lens wear for ≥ 2 weeks  Classification  Definition  
Serious Adverse 
Event  Those events that are life -threatening, or result in permanent impairment of a body 
function, or permanent damage to a body structure  or necessitate medical 
(therapeutic) or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
Significant 
Adverse Event  Those non- serious adverse events that occur with contact lens usage that are not 
sight -threatening but are usually symptomatic and may warrant therapeutic 
management and /or temporary or permanent discontinuation of contact lens wear.  
Non- Significant 
Adverse Events  Those less severe non -serious adverse events that occur w ith contact lens usage 
that are not sight -threatening, may or may not be symptomatic and may warrant 
palliative management, such as ocular lubricants or  temporary interruption of contact 
lens wear.  
Unanticipated 
Adverse Device 
Effect  Adverse events in a  clinical trial that were not previously identified in the protocol in 
terms of nature, severity, or degree of incidence. An Unanticipated Serious Adverse 
Device Effect is an unanticipated adverse event that is serious in nature and caused 
by or associated  with the device and is considered reportable.

is recommended (if not already classified)  
20 Other sign and/or symptom warranting classification as a non -significant 
adverse event  
Normal or adaptive symptoms  
Transient symptoms such as end- of-day dryness, lens awareness, itching or burning or other discomfort 
may occur with contact lens wear and may occasionally reduce wearing time. These are not reported 
as adverse events unless in the investigator’s opinion they are unexpected in nature, severe or 
have a high rate of occurrence.  
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as Adverse Events.  
8.2 Procedures for Adverse Events 
Treatment of an adverse event will depend on its nature and severity. Based on the clinical judgment of the investigator the subject  may be referred to an ophthalmologist for treatment. The investigator will 
attempt to determine whether the reaction is related to the test device or a result of other factors. An 
Adverse Event Form ( Appendix 1) will be completed  for each adverse event. Whenever possible, the 
adverse event will be photo- documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by the Sponsor (bills and prescription receipts kept). The subject must be followed until resolution and an Adverse Event 
Outcome Form (Appendix 1) completed indicating the  course of  treatment and resolution of the 
condition.

8.4 Discontinuation from the Study 
A subject’s study participation may be discontinued at any time if, in the opinion of the Sponsor  or the 
investigator , it is in the best interest of the subject. All discontinuations will be fully documented on the 
appropriate study forms and a discontinuation /exit form will be completed.  
8.5 Device Deficiencies 
A device deficiency  means the inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, usability,  safety or performance. Any device deficiency that will cause or contribute 
to a Serious Adverse Event should be reported to the Principal Investigator and the Sponsor  within 24 
hours of the investigator becoming aware of the deficiency.  
Other defective lenses should be reported to the Sponsor as soon as possible.  
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as comfort, 
vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as 
complaints or Device Deficiencies.

CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Val idation Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  9 Statistical Design and Analysis  
9.1 Statistical Hypothesis 
The primary statistical hypothesis is that the comfort  performance with the Test lens will demonstrate 
statistical equivalence to the comparator ( Control ) lens over two days of lens wear.    
The secondary statistical hypothesis is that the vision performance with the Test lens will demonstrate 
statistical equivalence to the comparator (Control) lens over two days of lens wear .  
Other hypotheses : 
The lens fit performance with the Test lens will demonstrate statistical equivalence to the comparator 
(Control) lens over two days of lens wear.  
The lens handling performance with the Test lens will demonstrate statistical equivalence to the 
comparator (Control) lens  over two days of lens wear.  
Corneal staining performance with the Test lens will demonstrate statistical equivalence to the comparator (Control) lens over two days of lens wear.  
9.2 Sample Size Calculations  
This is a confirmatory Design Validation clinical in vestigation where the calculated sample size is 
sufficient  to test the primary and secondary hypotheses described in Section 9.1 .  
9.2.1  Primary Hypothesis 
Table 3 below shows the sample size estimations for a paired t -test (alpha = 0.05) in order to detect 
differences in mean ocular comfort scores between Test vs. Control  conditions . Assuming a standard 
deviation of a paired difference of  13 points, a sample size of 44 subjects  provides adequate power to 
detect a potential paired difference of  7 points on a 0 -100 point scale.    
Confidential  Page 25 of 44  
CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Val idation Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  Table 3: Sample size estimation ( 0-100 numerical scal e) 
n=20  Paired Difference  
5 7.5 10 S.D. 
(Paired diference)  8 76% 98% 99% 
10 56% 89% 99% 
12 42% 76% 94% 
15 29% 56% 81% 
9.2.2  Secondary Hypothesis 
Assuming a standard deviation of a paired difference of  0.1 logMAR , a sample size of 27 subjects 
provides adequate power to detect a potential paired difference of 0.05 logMAR  in mean vision scores 
between Test vs. Control conditions for a paired t -test (alpha = 0.05) .   
Therefore, a sample size of approximately 45 completing subjects is sufficient for this study.  
9.3 Statistical Analysis  
Summary statistics [may/will] be produced (e.g. mean, standard deviation). Paired t -test will be used to 
compare slit lamp biomicroscopy, lens fit and subjective scores between study lens types. Where 
applicable, Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or paired analysis will be used to compare the variables between study visits. The critical alpha level for statistical significance will be set 
at p ≤  0.05, with adjustment for multiple comparisons.  
Equival ence testing will be undertaken to first determine statistical non-inferiority and then equivalence 
(if applicable) to the comparator (Control) lens, to confirm  the primary and secondary hypothes es.  
9.4 Data Entry / Data Management 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the clinical 
site Principal Investigator. The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. All source documents should be completed 
in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  
Confidential  Page 26 of 44  
CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Val idation Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  The clinical data for this study may be entered by designated study site personnel onto paper or 
electronic case report forms (CRFs). Case history and symptoms questionnaires may be given to subjects to complete in paper or electronic form.  
Unless otherwise documented, the CRFs will be considered the source document.  
The Sponsor or Sponsor’s representatives will be authorized to gain access to the source documentation 
for the purposes of monitoring and auditing the study. 
If study information is collected using an automated piece of equipment, the information may be recorded 
directly from the instrument display, captured electronically as output, or printed and entered into the CRF. The CRF will become the source document if there is no printout.  
9.5 Data Quality Assurance  
The CRFs will be completed at the time of the visit. All clinical data generated in the study will be submitted to the Sponsor for quality assurance review and analysis. All forms will be reviewed for 
completeness and evident recording errors will be rectified by contacting the appropriate clinical site. 
Computerized editing routines will be used to identify missing, invalid, inconsistent, or questionable data entries for verification prior to data analysis. These data issues will be resolved by contacting the relevant clinical site.  
10 General Study Management  
10.1 Monitoring Plan 
The Sponsor will ensure site qualification of the investigative site has been completed prior to conducting the clinical study in order to ensure that the site facility is adequate, personnel are qualified and 
resources are satisfactory.  
The protocol will be reviewed by the investigators prior to enrollment of the fir st subject. This will involve 
an overview of the protocol, which includes information on study objectives, inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, study visits and adverse event reporting. Data collection forms will also be reviewed and this will provide an opportunity to discuss any questions.  
During the course of the study, a remote site visit may be conducted to verify that written informed 
consent was obtained using the IRB approved ICF prior to each subject’s participation in the study.  
Confidential  Page 27 of 44  
CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Val idation Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  Findings of non- compliance shall be reviewed with the Investigator and disclosed in a written monitoring 
report.  The Monitor will report to the Sponsor any non- compliance with signed agreements, conditions 
imposed by the IRB/EC and the requirements of the study protocol. The Sponsor shall then either secure 
compliance or discontinue shipments of the lenses to the Investigator and may terminate the 
Investigator’s participation in the investigation, if required. 
Prior to final data freeze, a remote close- out visit/discussion will be conducted to check for accuracy and 
completeness of records. The Sponsor or Sponsor’s representatives will be authorized to gain access 
to the source documentation for the purposes of monitoring and auditing the study.  
10.2 Amendments 
Amendments to this Protocol  that may affect the rights, safety, or well -being of subjects  will require 
review and approval from IRB before the changes are implemented in the study. Investigators at the site will be provided with the revised protocol version, the site trained and the Protocol Signature Page of 
the amended protocol completed prior to enacting the amendments.  
10.3 Protocol Deviations 
A Protocol Deviation is an instance of failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the requirements 
of the protocol . Investigators will not deviate from the pprotocol except to protect the rights, safety and 
well-being of human subjects . Under emergency circumstances deviations may proceed without prior 
approval of the  Sponsor and the IRB/E C. Deviations shall be reported to the Sponsor, IRB/EC and the 
regulatory bodies , as required. 
Significant deviations which require changes to the research protocol or informed consent process/document or other corrective actions to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of patients or  others 
must be reported to the IRB/EC within ten business days of the deviation occurring (or its discovery). 
All deviations shall be reported to the S ponsor within two working days.  
All deviations occurring during the study will be documented on a protocol deviation form and documented  in the final Clinical Study Report (CSR) . 
10.4 Suspension or Premature Termination of the Clinical Investigation 
The study may be suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written 
notificatio n, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the 
Confidential  Page 28 of 44  
CV-20-63 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Val idation Template v 1.0: 06- May-2021  suspending or terminating party to the Investigator, the Sponsor  and the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB), as appropriate. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Investigator will promptly 
inform the IRB and will provide the reasons for the termination or suspension. In terminating the clinical investigation, CooperVision and the Principal investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
•Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants
•Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant  stopping
•Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements
•Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable
•Determination of futility
The blinding/masking code may be broken and communicated to the Principal Investigator only in the case of an emergency, such as an Adverse Event that requires knowledge of the identity of the investigational product in order to manage the subjects' condition.  
The study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance or data quality are addressed and satisfy the Sponsor and IRB /EC. 
Subjects will continue to receive follow -up care until they are able to be exited from the study (in the 
case of study termination) or are able to resume participation in the study (in the case of temporary study 
suspension), whereupon they will also be followed to exit.  
10.5 Record Retention 
Following study completion, data will be available in electronic and/or paper format for audit, Sponsor  
use, or subsequent analysis.  
Documents will be retained in a manner which allows for timely retrieval. Where documents are 
maintained in an electronic system, the system will be required to be maintained for the life of the document or the documents migrated to a system allowing for the continued retrieval of the document until the retention period has been completed.  
Access to the Network, eQMS or other electronic storage is secured to minimize potential loss or 
unauthorized changes. Documents will be stored in a manner to prevent loss and damage .

Study Design This study is an open-label, Phase 3, single-arm, multicenter study to 
evaluate the usability of an AI and safety of M923 targeting a total 
of 32 subjects with active, moderate to severe RA.
Planned Duration of Subject ParticipationUp to 32 weeks (4-week Screening period, 4-week treatment period, 
20-week treatment extension period, and 4-week safety follow-upperiod). Subjects who are inadequate responders, or who withdraw early or choose not to continue to the treatment extension period, will directly enter the 4-week safety follow-up period; all other subjects will enter the safety follow-up period on completion of the treatment extension period.
Primary Outcome Measure
Usability of the AI as assessed by the subject ratings captured in the PRE- and POST-SIAQ modules at 
Week 4
Secondary Outcome Measures
Usability
1. Observer assessment of usability by the subjects as determined by (i) ability to successfully follow
the steps in the Instructions for Use (IFU) to self-administer M923 via the AI and (ii) investigation of the frequency of observed or reported difficulties (‘potential hazards’) at Week 4 as well as 
change over time
2. Evaluations at Baseline and Week 2 for subject and observer assessments, as well as change over
time
Safety
1. Clinical safety and tolerability of M923 as assessed by vital signs, clinical laboratory results,
electrocardiograms (ECGs), and adverse events (AEs) (including serious adverse events [SAEs], 
AEs leading to premature withdrawal, and injection site reactions)
2. Immunogenicity of M923 assessed as proportion of subjects with evidence of seroconversion as
measured by titer of anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels over time, and proportion of subjects withneutralizing ADAs (nADAs)

6. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
6.1 Description of Investigational Product
M923 (BAX2923) is a proposed similar biological medical product (hereafter referred to 
as “proposed biosimilar”) to HUMIRA®(adalimumab, AbbVie, Inc.; hereafter referred to 
as “Humira”). Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF- α). 
Unlike etanercept, adalimumab does not bind to tumor necrosis factor–beta. Adalimumab was first approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration in 2002 for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and, later, for several other inflammatory conditions and has since been used widely, including in many large clinical studies. Hence, its effectiveness, tolerability, and safety are well established.
M923 is produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology in a 
. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.2 Clinical Condition/Indication
The medical need for a biosimilar to Humira (adalimumab) is demonstrated with the 
approval and use of the originator product Humira and its place in the treatment of several chronic autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, including RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, adult and pediatric Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and adult and pediatric plaque psoriasis.
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with approximately 
symmetrical inflammation of the joints of the hands and feet, leading to joint destruction, CCI
CCI
M923 Page 19of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
and paraproteinemia (“rheumatoid factor”). The condition is associated with increased 
morbidity  and mortality from all causes, and requires long -term treatment.2;3;4
Medication administered via SC injection offers the option of self -administration, 
providing benefits for the patient and healthcare s ystem.5Patients with chronic diseases ,
such as RA, 
who are able to self -inject their medication gain control of their treatment 
schedule (within the limits of the product label) and treatment setting, thus improving 
their treatment experience.5However, there are barriers to self -injection, including 
dexterity  problems and injection anxiety , which can prevent self
-injection being used 
successfull y and lead to lower treatment adherence.5This study  seeks to evaluate 
usability  of a SC AI for M923 in subjects with active, moder ate to severe RA.
6.3Population 
to Be Studied
The study  will enroll 32 subjects with active, moderate to severe RA. Adult ( ≥18 y ears) 
male and female subjects will be considered to be eligible provided that they satisfy  all of 
the eligibility criteria listed in Section 9.1and Section 9.2.
6.4Findings f
rom Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
M923 has been characterized and compared with US - and European Union (EU)-sourced 
Humira using a battery of nonclinical in vitro assay s, as well as an in vivo 
pharmacokinetics ( PK)study  in mice , and a PK and immunoge nicity study in 
cynomolgus monkey s. The results of the pharmacology , PK, and immunogenicity  
assessments demonstrated similar biological activity  of M923 and Humira. Specificall y, 
the results indicated that M923 was similar to Humira in terms of binding act ivity for 
soluble human TNF -α, the human Fcγ receptor, human C1q complex, and the human 
neonatal Fc receptor; activity  in the antibody -dependent cell -mediated cy totoxicity  and 
complement -dependent cy totoxicity  assay s; potency  inthe L929 mouse fibroblast cell 
line assay ; in vivo single -dose PK profile in mice and cynomolgus monkey s; and 
immunogenicit y
(in vivo in cy nomolgus monkey s and ex vivo T-cell proliferation in 
human dendritic cells) .
The PK profiles, safet y, tolerability, and immunogenicity  of M923, US Humira and 
EUHumira PK of M923 were evaluated in healthy  volunteers in aPhase 1, randomized, 
double -blind, 3 -arm, parallel -group, single -dose clinical study  (Study  #911301). Subjects 
received a single dose ( 40mg) of M923 o r Humira (US Reference Product or EU 
Reference Protein Product) and were 
followed- up for 71 day s. Overall 324 healthy  
subjects were randomized and treated. All randomized subjects completed the study .

Mean serum concentration -time profiles for M923 (n=107) , EU Humira (n=103), and 
USHumira (n=105) were similar in the primary  PK anal ysis set of subjects. Median time 
to maximum concentration was 144.000 hours for M923 and EU Humira and 
141.780 hours for US Humira. Geometric mean half-life was 311, 319, and 31 3 hours for 
M923, EU Humira, and US Humira, respectively . The geometric least-squares mean 
ratios for the primary  PK parameters [C max(maximum concentration) , AUC (area under 
the curve) (0-inf), and AUC( 0-336)] and secondary PK parameters [AUC( 0-672), AUC( 0-840), 
AUC( 0-1008), AUC( 0-1344), and AUC( 0-last)] were fully  contained within the 90% 
confidence interval (CI) bounds of 80.00% to125.00% for all treatment pairings. The 
secondary  anal yses performed utilizing PK analy sis subsets based on immunogenicity  
designations ( anti-drug antibody  [ADA] PK analysis set and non- ADA PK anal ysis set; 
neutralizing ADA [nADA] PK analy sis s et and non -nADA PK analy sis set ) supported the 
primary  anal ysis results.
Adalimumab exposure was weakl y correlated with formation of confi rmed ADAs and/or 
nADAs in subjects with low confirmed ADA tit ers. Review of individual adalimumab 
versus concentration time profiles did not reveal a consistent relationship between time of 
appearance of ADA or nADAs and time of last quantifiable adalimuma b concentrations 
or with shape of the terminal phase in subjects with low titers at low titer s (<1:8). ADAs
with higher tit ers which appeared earlier after administration tended to be associated with 
a shorter time to last quantifiable concentration and el imination half -life. These 
observations appeared to be independent of treatment.
There appeared to be a relationship of lower overall exposure (AUC) and half-lifeand 
higher apparent clearance (CL /F) in the presence of ADAs compared to absence of ADAs 
(ADA versus non-ADA population) and in the presence of nADAs compared to absence 
of nADAs (nADA versus non-nADA population). It should be noted that these apparent 
ADA
-correlated differences were independent of treatment (M923, US Humira ,or 
EUHumira) .
The overall incidence of ADA and nADA was comparable in each group (78.0% and 
16.5%, respectively , for subjects on M923; 78.5% and 20.6% for EU Humira and 80.6% 
and 27.8% for USHumira).
In this stud y (Study #911301), M923, US Humira ,and EUHumira were safe and well 
tolerated in the healthy  subjects. No subjects died or withdre w from the study  due to an 
AE. One subject reported SAEs of foot fracture, wound infection, and laceration as a 
result of trauma. All 3 events were assessed b y the investigator as not related to study  
treatment. The percentage of subjects with at least 1 AE was comparable among the 
M923 Page 21of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
3 treatment arms, ranging from 47.7% to 53.3%. Most of the AEs were considered mild 
and unrelated to treatment by  the i nvestigators. The number of subjects with severe AEs 
was low. Injection site reactions were mostly  mild. No clinically  significant trends over 
time or between the 3 treatment arms were observed in mean and median laboratory  
variables, vital signs measurements, and 12-lead elect rocardiogram (ECG) results.
Thus, bioequivalence was demonstrated 
for all primary  treatment comparisons 
(M923/US Humira; M923/ EUHumira; EU Humira/US Humira) in Study # 911301. 
M923 was demonstrated to be well -tolerated and to have a safet y profile comparable with 
those of EU Humira and US Humira after a single dose .
6.5Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to 
Human Subjects
All risks, contraindications, precautions, dosage and administration considerations, drug 
interac tions and overdose considerations that have been described for Humira appl y to 
M923 (see Section 9.2 of the I nvestigator’s Brochure [IB] for M923) . The safet y profile 
of M923 is anticipated to be similar to that of Humira ; however, i nvestigators should 
carefully  monitor for all AEs, including AEs not described as associated with Humira.
6.6Compliance Statement
This study  will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the I nternational Council 
forHarmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH GCP, April 1996), 
Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations, the European Clinical Trial Directive 
(2001/20/EC and 2005/28/EC), and applicable national and local regulatory

Ifthe subject requests it, additional training can be provided at Visit 3 (Week 2) prior to 
the second injection . The subject should perform the injection at Weeks 2 and 4 (Visits 3 
and 4) under observation in the clinic. Site staff should observe the injection at Weeks 0, 
2 and 4 (Visits 2 to 
4) to ensure it is being performed correctl y and provide re -training as 
necessary , indicated b y a subject request for additional training.
Subjects are to be instructed that used AIs must be placed in a safet y container provided 
by the Sponsor . This safety  container should be returned to the investigational site for 
disposal once full or at the end of the stud y.
8.6.3 Description of Treatment
Subjects will self -administer 40 mg of M923 Q2W starting at the Baseline Visit 2.
Self-injection should occur on the same day  each treatment week (±3days at Visits 3 and
4 and 
could be ±3 day s at Visits 5 to 14) targeting the same time of day . At Baseline and 
Weeks 2 and 4 ( Visits 2 to 4), injections will be administered by  the subject using the AI 
under the observation of the study  site staff in the clinic after all required assessments and 
blood sample collections have been completed. Subjects should be observed f or 2hours 
post-injection at Baseline and Week 2 and for 30 minutes post -injection at Week 4. 
At any  time during the study , the IP may  be interrupted or discontinued at the discretion 
of the investigator based on his/her evaluation of the subject’s condit ion or safet y. No 
dose modification is permitted for this study .
Any injection site reactions, regardless of causality, will be recorded on the AE case 
report form (CRF). An y concomitant medications, including those used to treat AE(s), 
will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
8.6.4 Investigational Product Accountability

10. STUDY PROCEDURES
10.1 Informed Consent and Enrollment
Any patient who provides informed consent (ie, signs and dates the informed consent 
form [ICF] and assent form, if applicable) is considered a study subject and enrolled in the study.
10.2 Subject Identification Code
 All study documents 
(eg, CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SIC. Additionally, a uniquely coded SIC(s) is permitted as long as 
it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (eg, collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in 
compliance with laws governing data privacy.
10.3 Screening and Study Visits
The study site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes all 
subjects enrolled. The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of screening outcome. If a subject is re-screened with the approval of the medical advisor or sponsor study physician, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject.
The overall study design is illustrated in the  Figure 1.  Details on the procedures to be 
performed at each study visit, including Screening, can be found in Section 20.2 Schedule 
of Study Procedures and Assessments and Section 20.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments.
10.3.1 Screening Assessments
After informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened on-site for eligibility 
based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Section 9.1 and Section 9.2,  
respectively. Screening must be performed within 28 days of Baseline, allowing enough time from Screening (Visit 1, Days -28 to Baseline) to Baseline (Visit 2, Day 1) in order to ensure eligibility requirements for Screening are met.PPD

During the study , subjects are expected to be on concomitan t medication(s) if they  are 
being treated or receiving proph ylaxis for any  underly ing medical conditions, provided 
the medications are not considered RA therapies and subjects have been on a stable dose 
for at least 4 weeks before Baseline. Subjects may ta ke permitted additional concomitant 
medication(s) as required for medical management during this study . All medications 
taken 4 weeks prior to Screening and concomitant medication use should be recorded in 
the appropriate CRF. Exposure to all biologic medi cations at an y time should be 
collected.
The following medications and non- drug therapies are notpermitted before study  entry  
and/orduring the course of the study :

Non-drug therapies:
Joint surgery  within 8 weeks of Screening
A subject who has taken any  of these medications or received an y of these non- drug 
therapies will be withdrawn. The subject will then enter the 4 -week safet y follow - up 
period as described in Section 10.3.6.
The following medications and non
-drug therapies are permitted before study  entry  and 
during the course of the study :
Medications:
Subjects on the following conventional DMARDs should be on a stable dose
for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening: MTX orally  (≤25 mg/day),
hydroxychloroquine ( ≤400 mg/day )orsulfasalazine (≤3g/day )
Oral corticosteroids are permitted at a dose of ≤10mg/day  prednisone or
equivalent if the subject has been stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening
M923 Page 40of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
Use of 1nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory  drug is permitted up to the maximum
doses permitted per labeling, provided the dose is stable for at least 2 week s
prior to Screening
All other prior non -RA concomitant treatments must be on a stable dose for at least 
4weeks before Baseline.
10.5 Subject Diary and Patient -reported Outcomes
A paper subject diary  will be provided to each subject at Baseline to record the f ollowing 
information:
1.Time, date, and location of IP administration, including whether the full dose was
administered and, if not, the reason why the full dose was not administered
(eg,device malfunction)
2.IP administrator (self)
3.AEs, including injection site reactions
4.PROs: PRE -and POST- SIAQ questionnaires to be completed by  the subject prior
to and after self -administration of IP, respectivel y
Subjects will be trained on use of the diary . The diary  will be provided in paper form at
and remain with the su bject for the duration of the study . The investigator will review the 
diary  for completeness and request missing information periodically  and in a timely  
manner. Untoward events recorded in the diary  will be reported as AEs according to the 
investigator ’s discretion and clinical judgment.
The subject diary  will serve as a source record and remain at the study  site. Entries in the 
subject diar y will be transferred i nto the appropriate collection device . Any entry  in the 
collection device that does not correspond with an entry  in the subject diary  will be 
explained by  the i nvestigator in source documentation .
10.6 Subject Completion/ Withdrawal
A subject is considered to have completed the study  when he/she ceases active 
participation in the stud y because the subject has, or is presumed to have, completed all 
study  procedures in accordance with the protocol (with or without protocol deviations ).
Reasons for completion/discontinuation will be reported on the 
Completion/Discontinuation CRF, includin g: completed, screen failure, AE(eg, death), 
discontinuation by  subject (eg, lost to follow-up [defined as 3 documented unsuccessful 
attempts to contact the subject], dropout), physician decision (eg, pregnancy , progressive 
M923 Page 41of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
disease, non- compliance with I P/protocol violation[s] , recovery), study terminated by 
Sponsor , orother (reason to be specified b y the i
nvestigator , eg, technical problems). 
Regardless of the reason, all data available for the subject up to the time of 
completion/discontinuation should be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
Every  effort will be made to have discontinued subjects complete the study 
completion/termination visit. If the completion/ termination visit is done as an additional, 
unscheduled visit, the assessment results shall be re corded with the 
completion/ termination visit. If a subject terminates participation in the study and does 
not return for thecompletion/ termination visit, their last recorded assessments shall 
remain recorded with theirlast visit . The reason for discontin uation will be recorded, and 
the data collected up to the time of discontinuation will be used in the analysis and 
included in the clinical study  report. If additional assessments are required ,the 
assessments shall be recorded separatel y
.Assessments to be performed at the termination 
visit (including in cases of withdraw alor discontinuation) can be found in S ections 20.2
and 20.3.
In the event of subject discontinuation due to an AE, clinical and/or la boratory  
investigations that are beyond the scope of the required study
 observations/assessments 
may be performed as part of the evaluation of the event. These investigations will take 
place under the direction of the investigator in consultation with the Sponsor , and the 
details of the outcome may  be reported to the appropriate regulat ory authorities by  the 
Sponsor .
10.7 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance
Subject compliance with the treatment regimen will be monitored by  completion of a 
subject diary  detailing the time and date of self- administration/home treatment of M923.

11.ASSESSMENT OF USABILITY, EFFICACY AND PHARMACOKINETICS
11.1
Primary Usability Assessment
The primary  outcome measure is the usability of the M923 AI as assessed by  the subject 
rating on the PRE -and POST- SIAQ modules at Week 4 of the treatment period. 
Usability  will be assessed using the SIAQ tool (version [v] 2. 1), which is a valid, reliable 
PRO instrument in patients with RA.5
The PRE -SIAQ module (v2. 1) is a 7-item questionnaire that investigates feelings about 
injections, self
-confidence (regarding self- administration), and satisfaction with 
self-injection (each i tem graded on a 5 -point scale).5The POST -SIAQ module (v2. 1) is a 
27 item questionnaire that assesses feelings about injections, self- image, self -confidence 
(regarding self -administration), pain and skin reactions during or after the injection 
(injection -site reactions), ease of use of the self -injection device, and satisfaction with 
self-injection. Each item graded on either a 5 -point or 6 -point scal e (see Section 20.4)
Subjects will complete the PRE -and POST
-SIAQ questionnaires prior to and after 
self-administration of IP, respectivel y, Q2W during the initia l 4-week treatment period 
(see Section 20.2).This assessment should be recorded in the eCRF.
11.2 Secondary Usability Assessments
Secondary  usabilit y measures are observer assessment of usability b y subjects as 
determined b y (i) ability  to successfull y follow the steps in the IFU to self -administer 
M923 via the AI and (ii) investigation of the frequency
 of observed or reported 
diffic ulties (‘potential hazards’) at Week 4, as well as change over time. At Weeks 0, 2, 
and 4 (Visits 2 to 4), the observer should observe the subject perform self -injection and 
complete the observer questionnaire (see Sections 20.4 and 20.6). In addition, usability  
evaluations at Baseline and Week
2 will be performed for subject (completion of 
PRE-and POST- SIAQ instruments as described in Section 11.1) and observer 
assessments, as well as c hange over time. This assessment should be recorded in the 
eCRF.
11.3 Immunogenicity Assessment
Immunogenicit y of M923 is a secondary  safety  outcome measure, which will be 
examined at Baseline and Weeks
4, 12 and 24(Visits 2, 4, 8 and 14/EDV, respectivel y)
and the Safet y Follow -up Visit, assessed as the proportion of all subjects with evidence of 
seroconversion as measured b y titer of ADAs (ANA and anti -dsDNA) levels over time, 
and proportion of subjects with nADAs . Anti- drug antibody  analysis will be conducted 
using a screening assay  based on M923 to identify potentially  positive ADA samples . 
Confirmatory  assay s based on Humira and M923 will be used to confirm the positive 
M923 Page 43 of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
status of the samples. In confirmed positive samples, a third assay will be used to 
determine the relative titer of the ADA; a subsequent neutralizing antibodies assay will be used to determine the presence of neutralizing antibodies and an isotyping assay will be performed. Blood sample processing and handling details will be presented in a separate laboratory manual. Serum samples will be analyzed by Quintiles BioSciences using validated assays.
Blood samples for immunogenicity analyses will be collected at the times and visits 
shown in the schedule of assessments in Section 20.2.

12.ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
12.1 Adverse Events
12.1.1 Definitions
An AE is defined as an y untoward medic al occurrence in a subject administered an IP 
that does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can 
therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom (eg, rash, pain, discomfort, fev er, dizziness, etc.) , conditions (eg, peritonitis, 
bacteremia, etc.) ,or outcome of death temporally  associated with the use of an IP, 
whether or not considered causall y related to the IP .
A treatment -
emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an y event not present prior to 
the initiation of the treatments or an y event already present that worsens in either 
intensity  or frequency  following exposure to the treatments.
12.1.1.1 Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at an y dos e meets one or 
more of the following criteria:
1. Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death)
2.Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment
of the investigator , at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an
event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death had it been more severe.
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing
hospitalization –inpatient hospitalization refers to any inpatient admission,
regardless of length of stay
4.Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (ie, a substantial
disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life functions)
5.Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect
6.Is a medicall y important event –a medical event that may  not be immediately
life-threatening or result in death or require hospitalization but may  jeopardize the
subject or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other
outcomes listed in the definitions abov e. Examples of such events are:
Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic
bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in
hospitalization, or development of drug dependence or drug abuse
Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for HI V, HBV, or HCV
M923 Page 46of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
Uncomplicated pregnancies , following maternal or paternal exposure to I Pare not 
considered an (S)AE; however, an y pregnancy complication or pregnancy  termination by  
therapeutic, elective, or spontaneous abortion shall be considered an SAE.
12.1.1.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)
Any suspected adverse reaction to study  treatment (ie, including active comparators) that 
is both serious and unexpected.
The event(s) must meet all of the following
Suspected adverse reaction
Serious
Unexpected
Assessed as related to study  treatment (seeSection 12.1.2.2)
Once determined to meet the criteria for a SUSAR, a serious adverse event should be 
submitted to regulatory  agencies expeditiously .
12.1.1.3 Non-Serious Adverse Event
A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE.
12.1.1.4 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is defined as an y serious adverse 
effect on health or safet y or an y life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity , or degree of incidence in the study  protocol o r product labeling, or an y 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safet y, or welfare of subjects.
12.1.1.5 Unexpected Adverse Events
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity , specificit y, or outco me is 
not consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference Safet y 
Information ( RSI). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacologica l properties of 
the product , but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular product
under investigation. The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor using 
the IB as the RSI . This determination will include considerations 
such as the number of 
AEs previously  observed, but not on the basis of what might be anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of a product.
M923 Page 47of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
12.1.1.6 Pre-existing Diseases
Pre-existing diseases that are present before entry  in to the study  are described in th e 
medical history, and those that manifest with the same severity , frequency , or duration 
after IP exposure, will not be recorded as AEs. However, when there is an increase in the 
severit y, duration, or frequency of a pre -existing disease, the event must b e described on 
the AE CRF.
12.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events
For the purposes of this study , each non- serious untoward medical occurrence reported
by a subject undergoing study -related procedure(s) before the first M923 treatment will 
be recorded on the AE CRF; for SAEs the SAE Report ( SAER )form is to be used ,in 
addition; however, these events will not be included in the anal ysis of AEs .
Each treatment -emergent AE (non-serious AE or SAE) from the first M923 exposure 
until study  completion/discontinuation or 4 weeks following the last M923 treatment will
be described on the AE CRF using the medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis 
could be established at the time of reporting the AE, a sy mptom or sign, in standard 
medical terminology  in order to avoid 
the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial 
expressions (see definition in Section 12.1). Each AE will be evaluated b y the 
investigator for:
1.
Seriousness as defined in Section 12.1.1.1
2.Severity  as defined in Section 12.1.2.1
3.Causal relationship to I P exposure ,study  procedure , or device as defined in
Section 12.1.2.2
For each AE, the outcome (ie, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if 
applicable action taken (ie, dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug 
interrupted, drug discontinued , not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the 
AE CRF. Recovering/resol ving AEs will be followed until resolution, medically
stabilized, or 4weeks after the study  completion/termination visit, whichever comes first.
If the severity  rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original 
AE report will be revised (ie, the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the 
course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported.
Treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, 
and deviations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of expected 
pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed 
M923 Page 48of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
with regar d to occurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy, and/or other observations because 
these events may be reportable to regulatory  authorities.
Any pregnancy  that occurs after administration of M923 will be reported on a Pregnancy  
Report Form and followed- up at estimated date of delivery  and 1 year post- delivery , if
feasible.
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE occurring in a subject after study  
completion, the SAE must be reported on the provided SAE R Form within 24 hours 
after becoming aware ; no additional reporting on CRFs is necessary .
12.1.2.1 Severity
The investigator will assess the severit y of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and 
judgment based on the most appropriate description below:
1.Mild
The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner
with the subject’s normal functioning level
The AE resolves spontaneously  or may  require m inimal therapeutic
intervention
2.Moderate
The AE produces limited impairment of function and may  require therapeutic
intervention
The AE produces no sequel a/sequelae
3.Severe
The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may lead to temporary
inabili ty to resume usual life pattern
The AE produces sequel a/sequelae , which require (prolonge d) therapeutic
intervention
These severity  definitions will also be used to assess the severit y of an AE with a 
study -related procedure(s) , if necessary .
M923 Page 49of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
12.1.2.2 Causality
Causality  is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility  that the I P is 
etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality  assessment includes, eg, 
assessment of temporal relationships, de- challenge/re -challenge information, association 
(or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely  
cause, and ph ysiological plausibility .For each AE, the i nvestigator will assess the causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE usin g his/her clinical expertise and judgment 
according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE:
1. Not related (either 1 or both circumstances are met)
Has little or no temporal relationship to the I P
A more likely  alternative etiology  exists
2.
Related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of I P, which may
include but is not limited to the following
:
oReappearance of a similar reaction upon re -administration of IP (positive
re-challenge)
oPositive results in a drug sensitivity  test (skin test, etc.)
oToxic level of the I P as evidenced by  measurement of the I P
concentrations in the blood or other bodily  fluid
Another etiology  is unlikely  or significantly  less likely
For events assessed as not related or unlikel y related and occurring within 
72hours , the 
investigator shall provide the alternative etiology . These causality  definitions will also be 
used to assess the relationship of an AE with a study -related procedure(s), if nece ssary .
12.1.2.3 Safety Reporting
Adverse events/SAEs will be assessed at all s tudy visits as outlined in Table 2and 
Section12.1 above.
Adverse Events/SAEs are to be recorded on the AE page ofthe eCRF. Each event should 
be recorded separatel y.
Any SAE, including death due to any  cause, which oc curs during this study , whether or 
not related to the IP, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the study  site’s 
first knowledge of the event). All SAEs must be reported via the Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) s ystem by  completing the relevant eCRF page(s) in English. Once the SAE has 
M923 Page 50of 84
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 911502 2016 AUG 26
been recorded in the EDC sy stem, the Sponsor and other designated recipients will be 
informed of the event automatically . For instances in which the EDC may  become 
unavailable, SAEs must be reported using the back -up paper SAER F ormto meet the 
24
hour timeline requirement ( for contacts and instructions refer to the SAER F orm).

12.2 Urgent Safety Measures
An urgent safet y measure is an immediate action taken, which is not defined by  the 
protocol, in order to protect subjects participating in a clinical study from immediate 
harm. Urgent safet y measures may  be taken by  the Sponsor or clinical i nvestigator , and 
may include any  of the following: 
1.Immediate change in study  design or stud y procedures
2.Temporary  or permanent halt of a given clinical study or studies
3.Any other immediate action taken in order to protect clinical study participants
from immediate hazard to their health and safet y
The investigator may take appropriate urgent safety  measures in order to protect subjects 
against any immediate hazard to their health or safety. The measures should be taken 
immediately  and may  be taken without prior authorization from the Sponsor . In the 
event(s) of an apparent immediate hazard to the subject, the investigator will notify  the 
Sponsor immediately  by phone and confirm notification to the Sponsor in writing as soon 
as possible, but within 1 calendar day after the change is implemented. The Sponsor will 
also ensur e the responsible Ethics Committee ( EC)is notified of the urgent measures 
taken in such cases according to local regulations.
12.3 Untoward Medical Occurrences
Untoward medical occurrences that occur before the first exposure to M923 and are not 
related to stu dy procedures are not considered AEs (according to the definition of AE, see 
Section 12.1). However, each serious untoward medical occurrence that is experienced 
before the first M923 exposure (ie, from the time of signed informed consent up to but 
not including the first M923 exposure) and is not related to stud y procedures will be 
described on the AE CRF and on the SAER Form . These events will not be considered as 
SAEs and will not be included in the anal ysisof SAEs.
For the purposes of this study , each non- serious untoward medical occurrence 
experienced b y a subject undergoing Screening study -related procedure(s) before the first 
M923 exposure wil l be recorded on the AE CRF (see Section 12.1) ; these events will not 
be included in the analy sis of AEs. S erious untoward medical occurrence sreported
before the first administration of M923 (ie, from the time of signed informed consent up 
to but not including the first administration of M923) will be reported as an SAE .

medical history  CRF. At study  visits, if a new abnormal or worsened abnormal 
pre-
existing condition is detected, the condition will be described on the AE CRF. If the 
abnormal value was not deemed an AE because it was due to an error, due to a 
pre-existing disease (described in Section 12.1.1.6 ), not clinically  significant, a symptom 
of a new/worsened condition already recorded as an AE, or due to another issue that will 
be specified, the investigator will record the justification on the source record.

hA 12 -lead ECG should be performed before blood sampling.
iVital signs a ssessments should be performed within 30 m inutes before and after administration of IP at each study visit. Vital signs should be taken
before blood sampling. Height w ill be measured at Screening only.
jPK and immunogenicity blood samples are to be collec ted at these timepoints in all subjects. Samples should be collected predose (ie, prior to 
administering IP) and before any hematology/chemistry samples to be drawn at that visit.
kBlood samples will be taken before injection of IP, after ECG and vital signs assessments, and after PK and immunogenicity sampling if applicable.
lPregnancy testing is only required for female subjects of childbearing potential. A serum test will be performed at Screening ; urine pregnancy tests 
will be performed at all other
applicable visits .
mSubject should complete PRE -SIAQ prior to injecting, and POST -SIAQ after completing self -injection at each applicable visit.
nSelf-injection training for the AI should be provided at Baseline prior to the first injection, w ith subjec ts performing the injection. If the subject 
requests it, additional training can be provided at prior to the second injection, but the subject should perform the injecti on.
oIPwill be self -administered in the clinic after all required assessments and blo od sample collections have been completed at Weeks 0, 2 ,and 4.
Subjects should be observed for 2 hours post -injection at Weeks 0 and 2, and for 30 minutes post -injection at Week 4. All other injections will be at
home.
pThe investigator or a qualified de signee will evaluate the injection site before IP administration (see
 Section 12.10 ) and 30 minutes after IP
administration.
qObserver should observe the subject perform self -injection and complete observer questionnaire. Re -training of the subject should be provided after 
observation of full injection completed as necessary and prior to next injection.

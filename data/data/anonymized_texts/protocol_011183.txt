INTRODUCTION 
Overview 
 
The Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) is an electrohydraulic (EH) device designed to improve 
the appearance of cellulite. Devices using RAP technology have been successfully used in 
seven human clinical trials to accelerate laser-based tattoo removal, a proof of concept 
(POC) and pivotal clinical trials to improve the appearance of cellulite without the 
occurrence of device related UAEs or SAEs. The purpose of this single-site, multi-
treatment clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ZELTIQ Aesthetics, 
Inc.’s Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) device for the improvement of cellulite.  
Cellulite 
 
Cellulite is the often aesthetically displeasing rippling or dimpling of the skin most 
commonly located on the thighs and buttocks of women. Its appearance and texture are 
often likened by laypeople to that of “cottage cheese” or an orange peel [1].  
In a paper discussing anatomical approaches to treating cellulite by Christman et al [1], “In 
normal skin, there is a support network of fibrous septa running through the subcutis, 
separating the adipose cells into chambers resembling a quilt. Magnetic resonance imaging 
demonstrates that in cellulite, these fibrous septa are contracted and sclerosed, ultimately 
tethering the skin at a fixed length. Concurrently, the adipose cells expand with weight gain 
or water absorption, promoting herniation, or outpouching of fat into the dermis. This 
results in skin dimpling creating the characteristic cellulite appearance. Two distinct 
morphologies of cellulite may be identified, sometimes coexisting in the same patient: 1) 
diffuse rippling in patients with increased adiposity and/or increased skin laxity and 2) 
dimpling, with discrete ellipsoid or linear depressions, in patients with good skin tone [1].”

 2021-06 Rev 02 CONFIDENTIAL  23UNSCHEDULED VISITS 
An unscheduled visit may be performed at any time during the study at the participant’s 
request or as deemed necessary by the study investigator. The date and reason for the visit 
will be recorded in the source document.  
 
PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWALAND EARLY TERMINATION 
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request or withdrawn 
from at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, or 
administrative reasons. The Investigator should inquire about reason for withdrawal, 
request the participant to return for a final visit, and follow up with any unresolved adverse 
events. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor of any participants withdrawal or 
discontinuance.  
RISKS AND BENEFITS 
Clinical Benefit  
There is no clinical benefit in this study. The participant may experience an improvement 
in the aesthetic appearance of the treated areas. 
 

  
 2021-06 Rev 02 CONFIDENTIAL  24  

  
 2021-06 Rev 02 CONFIDENTIAL  25Risk Mitigations 
 
The Investigator in this clinical study has been invited to participate in this study based 
on his/her previous experience with the use of energy-based systems and other novel 
modalities in aesthetic dermatology and plastic surgery. Experience with cosmetic 
treatments is the most critical element in managing participant risk in this trial. All other 
known risks will be disclosed to the participant via the informed consent process. Risks 
have been mitigated by the specific design employed in manufacturing the device. 
 
REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND COMPLICATIONS  
Adverse Events 
 
The Investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as provided in this protocol. During the study when 
there is a safety evaluation, the Investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, 
documenting, and reporting AEs and SAEs as detailed in this Section of the protocol. 
At the treatment and follow-up visits, participants will be assessed for known physiological 
responses and adverse events.  
Adverse Event (AE) 
o An adverse event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease that occurs or is reported by the participant to have 
occurred, or a worsening of a pre-existing condition. An adverse event may or 
may not be related to the study treatment.  
o AEs will be elicited through direct questioning and participant reports. Any 
abnormality in physical examination findings that the investigator believes is 
clinically significant (CS) to the research participant and that occurred after 
initiation of the first study treatment will be reported as AEs. Abnormal findings 
that are NOT clinically significant should not be recorded as an AE. 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE) 
o An ADE is defined as an adverse event related to the use of an investigational 
medical device. This definition includes any adverse events resulting from 
insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, 
installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical 

  
 
 2021-06 Rev 02 CONFIDENTIAL  26device as well as any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device. This includes “comparator” if the 
comparator is a medical device. 
1. R eporting of Adverse Events 
o Report initiation for all AEs and SAEs will begin at the time of the first 
treatment and continue until the end of the final study observation visit. All 
events will be followed to resolution or until the participant completes the study. 
A final assessment of outcome will be made at that time.  
o All AEs must be recorded in the participant’s medical records and in the case 
report form. AEs will be reported using customary medical terminology along 
with the following information: the onset and end dates, whether the event is an 
SAE, the impact the event had on study treatment, the severity of the event, the 
causality of the event, whether treatment was given as a result of the event, and 
the outcome of the event. 
2. I mpact on Study Treatment 
o The impact the event had on the study treatment will be assessed as either: none, 
study treatment interrupted, study treatment discontinued, or not applicable. 
The “not applicable” assessment will be used only when the participant is in the 
observation phase of the protocol. 
3. Causality Assessment 
o AEs 
will be assigned a relationship (causality) to the study treatment. The 
Investigator will be responsible for determining the relationship between an AE 
and the study treatment. The type of event, organ system affected, and timing 
of onset of the event will be factors in assessing the likelihood that an AE is 
related to the study treatment. Relationship of AEs to study treatment will be 
classified as follows: 
i. Definitely related: This category applies to those AEs that the 
Investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to the study treatment.  An 
AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it 
meets all of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study treatment; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the participant’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the participant; (3) it follows a known response pattern 
to treatment with the study treatment. 
ii. Probably related: This category applies to those AEs which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high 
degree of certainty to be related to the study treatment. An AE may be 
considered probable if or when (must have three): (1) it follows a 
reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by participant’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies 
administered to the participant. (3) Disappears or is decreased upon 
  
 
 2021-06 Rev 02 CONFIDENTIAL  27discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It follows a known response 
pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
iii. Possibly related: This category applies to those AEs which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged unlikely 
but cannot be ruled out with certainty to the study treatment. An AE 
may be considered possible if or when (must have two): (1) it follows a 
reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by participant’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies 
administered to the participant. (3) Disappears or is decreased upon 
discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It follows a known response 
pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
iv. Remotely related: In general, this category can be considered applicable 
to those AEs which, after careful medical consideration at the time they 
are evaluated, are judged likely to be unrelated to the study treatment. 
An AE may be considered unlikely if or when (must have two): (1) it 
does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the study treatment. (2) It could not readily have been produced by 
participant’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
therapies administered to the participant. (3) Disappears or is decreased 
upon discontinuation of the study treatment. (4) It does not follow a 
known response pattern to treatment with the study treatment.  
v. U nrelated: This category applies to those AEs which, after careful 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are clearly and 
incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.) 
and determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
treatment. 
4. Outcome Assessment 
o The outcome of the event will be assessed as either: resolved, resolved with 
sequelae, ongoing, or death. Only one AE per participant is allowed to have an 
outcome assessment as “death.”  If there are multiple causes of death for a given 
participant, only the primary cause of death will have an outcome of death. 
5. Serious Adverse Events 
o A S
erious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any AE that: 
i. Results in death 
ii. Is life threatening (the participant is at immediate risk of dying from the 
adverse experience) 
iii. Requires participant hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization 
iv. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
  
 
 2021-06 Rev 02 CONFIDENTIAL  29the scope of the study. It is the Investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to ensure that 
participants understand that participation in the study is voluntary, and that the quality of 
their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in the study. 
Adequate time for any questions and explanations will be provided. Participant will have 
the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates and have time to think about it 
prior to participating. Participants may withdraw their consent at any time throughout the 
course of treatment. Once the participant understands the informed consent, he/she will be 
allowed to voluntarily agree to participate by signing the document. The 
investigator/designee is responsible for obtaining informed consent prior to enrollment in 
the study and ensuring that participant have a copy of the document for their records. The 
participant is considered enrolled in the study after the informed consent has been signed 
and it has been verified that the participant meets all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria.  
RECORDS MANAGEMENT  
Study Records Retention : Each site will maintain appropriate medical records for 
this study in accordance with institutional requirements including, but not limited to, 
hospital records, laboratory tests, pharmacy dispensing records, x-rays, and clinical charts. 
As part of study participation, each site will permit the Sponsor ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc., 
or its designee, to examine (and when required by applicable law, to copy) clinical records 
for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits and evaluation of study safety and 
progress. 
i. Essential documents, as listed below, must be retained by the site until at least 
2 years after completion or termination of the investigation, or longer if 
advised by the Sponsor or designee.  
ii. If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason cannot keep study 
records, the records may be transferred to an acceptable designee. The 
Sponsor or its designee must be notified in writing of the name, address, and 
telephone number of the person designated to retain the study records. By 
signing the protocol, the Investigator agrees to adhere to the document 
retention procedures. 
iii. Essential documents may include: 
1. IRB approvals for the study protocol and all amendments 
2. Participant’s informed consent forms 
3. All source documents 
4. C ase Report Forms 
5. Data change forms or data queries 
6. Monitoring logs and appointment schedules 
7. Investigators CVs, medical license information, and financial 
disclos
ure documentation 
  
 
 2021-06 Rev 02 CONFIDENTIAL  308. All sponsor representative/investigator correspondence, including 
te
lephone logs 
9. Any other pertinent study documents 
Pr
otocol Deviations : Protocol deviations occur when there are variations in the 
approved study protocol, criteria, or procedure. An example of this would be a participant 
visit conducted outside the follow-up schedule. As protocol deviations may increase the 
risk or decrease the benefit of the intervention and/or affect the participant’s rights, safety, 
welfare and/or integrity of the resultant data, investigators are required to record and report 
all incidences in a deviation log for adjudication during data analysis. 
iv. All protocol deviations must be reported to Sponsor in a timely manner of 
their occurrence. Evaluation of the deviation and its impact on the study 
protocol will be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis. Data discrepancies or 
questions resulting from reported protocol deviations will be managed 
between Sponsor and the site investigator or their designee. 
Protocol Violation: A violation is any non-adherence to the protocol that may result 
in significant additional risk to the participant (e.g., enrollment of a participant who does 
not meet the study criteria). A protocol violation can also be an event of non-adherence to 
GCPs that may impact participant safety (e.g., failure to obtain proper consent before 
performing study procedures). Violations should be reported to the study sponsor and the 
IRB within 5 working days if they occur. 
INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND STORAGE 
The Sponsor will maintain full device accountability. The Investigator will maintain 
adequate records documenting all materials received and returned, and shipping 
information of the device. All used materials will be discarded by the Investigator after 
each treatment has been completed. 
 
REGULATORY AND ETHICAL COMPLIANCE  
1. The Study will comply with all instructions, regulations, and agreements in this 
prot
ocol. In addition, the study will comply with all local regulations, external 
standards and applicable ICH and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. 
 
2. Institutional Review Board: The site that is participating in this study must have this 
protocol and the associated informed consent approved through the IRB. Any 
amendments to the protocol or informed consent will be routed through IRB for 
approval prior to use.  
 
3. Participant Confidentiality: Participant confidentiality for all data collected during the 
course of treatment will be maintained by the Investigator, on-site staff, and the 
Sponsor. All pictures of the participant’s test areas will be de-identified, secure, 
privileged, and compliant with all HIPAA guidelines. A unique participant 
identification (ID) code will be assigned to each participant in the study. This ID code 
will be used throughout the course of treatment to ensure that no identifying 
  
 
 2021-06 Rev 02 CONFIDENTIAL  31information exists on any Case Report Forms. The document which contains the 
participant ID key will be stored in a locked cabinet and will only be accessible by 
authorized study personnel. Private and confidential information about each participant 
will be preserved in any report or publication of the clinical investigation data. 
 
4. Investigator Conflict of Interest: The proposed study will be conducted in accordance

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND MONITORING  
All participant data will be entered into a study database created and controlled by ZELTIQ 
Aesthetics, Inc.  
The Sponsor will train the study site and be present at the initiation of treatment. The 
Sponsor will monitor the site at various intervals during the study. Monitoring activities 
may be on site or remote. Case Report Forms and source documents will be reviewed to 
verify adherence to the protocol; for completeness, accuracy, and consistency of data; and 
adhere to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The Sponsor will collect 
data throughout the study and at the end of the follow up period. 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial-related site’s source 
data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by ZELTIQ 
Aesthetics, Inc. or designee, and inspection by local and regulatory authorities (as 
appropriate). 
The investigational site will have established standard operating procedures (SOPs) for 
quality management. Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and accuracy 
in relation to source documents. The study will be conducted in accordance with 
procedures identified in the protocol.  
The data and any research conducted will be controlled by ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc. 
STUDY RESULTS/ANALYSIS  
Sample Size Determination : Up to fifteen (15) participants will be enrolled and 
treated in this study. The sample size is based on clinical and practical exploratory 
considerations and not a formal statistical power. 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics : Demographic and baseline 
characteristics will include age, sex, ethnicity, race, gender identity, height, and weight, 
Fitzpatrick Skin Type, and Cellulite Dimple assessment of bilateral posterior thighs 
and/or buttocks.  
  
 
 2021-06 Rev 02 CONFIDENTIAL  32Study Analysis Populations : The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all 
participants who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, received 
assigned three treatments with the device and completed the 12-week, follow-up visits 
per the protocol. The FAS will be treated as the primary analysis set.   
Effectiveness Parameter Analysis : Descriptive statistics will be performed on the 
population per protocol, all participants completing the study without major protocol 
deviations. Descriptive statistics (i.e., mean, standard deviation, etc.) will be provided for 
all continuous variables, percentages and frequencies for all categorical variables 
collected in this study.  
Summary tables will be used to present population characteristics at Baseline. For 
categorical parameters, the number and percentage of participants in each category will 
be presented. The denominator for percentage will be based on the number of participants 
appropriate for the purpose of analysis. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics 
will include n (number of participants), mean, standard deviation, median, and range. No 
imputation will be used to account for missing data. No processing for outliers will be 
performed. Data will be presented as reported on the CRF. 
Safety Analysis : The Safety Analysis Set will consist of all enrolled participants who 
receive RAP treatment (started or completed).  
Safety analyses will be performed in terms of incidence and severity of adverse events. 
These will be tabulated and a complete listing of all reports of adverse and/or 
unanticipated events will be presented.  
SUSPENSION OR PREMATURE TERMINATION OF STUDY 
The Sponsor reserves the right to suspend or prematurely terminate the study in its entirety 
or at an investigational site for significant and documented reasons. An Investigator, IRB, 
or regulatory authority may suspend or prematurely terminate participation in the clinical 
investigation for which they are responsible at any time in collaboration with the Sponsor. 
PUBLICATION POLICY   
Any investigator who wishes to develop a publication or presentation based on the results 
from this study must obtain written approval from ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc. prior to 
submission. ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc. may grant the investigator the freedom to publish 
any scientific or medical results deemed by the author to be of medical or scientific

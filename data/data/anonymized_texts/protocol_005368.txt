Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Double -blind Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and 
Efficacy of Intravenous CD101 vs Intravenous Caspofungin Followed By Oral Fluconazole Step- down in the 
Treatment of Subjects with Candidemia and/or Invasive Candidiasis  
Planned Study Centers: Approximate ly 60  
Phase of Development: 2  
Objectives  
The primary objectives of this study are to:  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous CD101 (CD101 IV) in the Safety population 
• Evaluate overall success (mycological eradication and resolution of systemic signs attributable to 
candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis [IC]) of CD101 IV in subjects with candidemia and/or IC at Day 
14 (±1 day) in the Microbiological Intent -to-treat (mITT) population  
The secondary objectives of this study are to:  
• Evaluat e overall success (mycological eradication and resolution of systemic signs attributable to 
candidemia and/or IC) of CD101 IV at Day 5, Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC), and Follow -up 
(FU, Days 45 -52 for subjects with candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without 
candidemia) in the mITT population  
• Evaluate mycological success (eradication) of CD101 IV at Day 5, Day 14 (±1 day), Day 28 (±2 days; 
only for subjects with IC), and FU (Days 45- 52 for subjects with candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for 
subjects with IC, with or without candidemia) in the mITT population  
• Evaluate clinical cure as assessed by the Investigator for CD101 IV at Day 14 (±1 day), Day 28 (±2 days; 
only for subjects with IC), and FU (Days 45- 52 for subjects with  candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for 
subjects with IC, with or without candidemia) in the mITT population  
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CD101 IV  
Study Design: This is a Phase 2, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double -blind, study of CD101 IV  or IV 
caspofungin followed by oral fluconazole step -down therapy for treatment of subjects with candidemia and/or 
IC. In Part A, subjects will be randomized  in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive CD101 IV treatment Group 1, CD101 IV 
treatment Group 2, or IV caspofun gin (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Table 1). Oral step -down therapy is 
allowed in all 3 treatment groups in Part A; oral placebo in the CD101 IV groups and oral fluconazole in the 
caspofungin group. After approximately 90 subjects hav e been enrolled in the mITT pop ulation in Part A, 
enrollment into Part A of the study will close and Part B will begin. In Part B , subjects will be randomized  in a 
2:1 ratio to receive CD101 IV treatment or IV caspofungin ( Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Table 1) until ≥ 45 
additional subjects and no more than 120 subjects have been  enrolled . (Note: Subjects enrolled under 
Amendment 5 and assigned to CD101 IV receive Group 1 treatment  and subjects enrolled under Amendment 6 
and assigned to CD101 IV receive Group 2 treatment . Subjects enrolled to Amendment 5 continue study 
participation according to the same amendment  regardless of subsequent approval of Amendment 6. ) Total 
enrollment will depend on the enrollment rate for the  6- to 8-month period between the end of Part A and the 
staged start of the Phase 3 study , which is the trigger for the rolling close -out of Part B . Oral step -down therapy 
is allowed in both treatment groups in Part B; oral placebo in the CD101 IV group an d oral fluconazole in the 
caspofungin group.  
Subjects with candidemia only may be treated with study drug for a maximum of 21 days. Subjects with IC 
(with or without candidemia) may be treated with study drug for a maximum of 28 days.  For this study, 
subjects will be presumed to have IC if there is a positive culture for Candida spp.  from a normally sterile site 
other than blood or if there is a positive sponsor -approved rapid in vitro diagnostic (IVD) or blood culture for 
Candida spp.  combined with rad iographic evidence of IC.  
Subjects in the CD101 IV treatment Group 1 will receive CD101 IV 400 mg on Day 1 and Day 8, with an 
optional dose of 400 mg on Day 15 (for all subjects) and an optional dose of 400 mg on Day 22 (only for 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 4 of 128 
 subjects with IC), if need ed. Subjects  in the CD101 IV treatment Group 2 will receive CD101 IV 400 mg on 
Day 1 and 200 mg on Day 8, with an optional dose of 200 mg on Day 15 (for all subjects) and an optional dose 
of 200 mg on Day 22 (only for subjects with IC), if needed. S ubjects  in the caspofungin group will receive IV 
caspofungin (a single 70 mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by 50 mg once daily) for ≥3 days up to a 
maximum of 21 days for subjects with candidemia only and up to a maximum of 28 days for subjects with IC 
(with or without candidemia). The optional doses of CD101 IV on Day 15 and Day 22 may be administered 
according to the  subject’s clinical response and the medical judgment of the Principal Investigator (PI ).  
After ≥3 days of IV therapy, subjects in the caspofungin  group can be switched to oral step -down therapy of 
fluconazole (a loading dose of 800 mg [4 capsules] on the first day followed by 400 mg [2 capsules]/day 
thereafter) if criteria are met. In order to maintain the blind, subjects in the CD101 IV groups who  have 
switched to oral step -down therapy will receive oral placebo (4 capsules on the first day followed by 2 capsules 
/day thereafter) and subjects in the caspofungin treatment group will receive IV placebo on Day 8, and on Days 
15 and 22 if study drug is  administered through these timepoints. The total IV plus oral treatment duration will 
be ≥14 days and up to a maximum of 28 days.  
The dose and duration of any prior antifungal treatment taken within 4 weeks from randomization will be 
recorded at Screenin g. A retinal examination for  evidence of a Candida eye infection, including 
endophthalmitis or chorioretinitis , will be performed during Screening or by Day 7 only on  subjects with 
candidemia  by blood culture, and should be repeated in subjects who were negative at baseline if the subject 
develops visual signs or symptoms of  a Candida eye infection during the course of the study. Subjects who 
were negative at baseline and diagnosed with  a Candida eye infection after initiating s tudy d rug should have an 
urgent ophthalmologic consultation (if not already done), should stop study drug, and be initiated on 
appropriate therapy for Candida eye infection per the local guidelines. If possible, all subjects diagnosed with 
endophthalmitis or cho riorentinitis should remain  in the study and all subsequent antifungal drugs, 
interventions, and outcomes for endophthalmitis or chorioretinitis should be recorded.  
The Schedule of Assessments and Procedures is presented in  Table 2. Study Day 1 is defined as the first day of 
study drug administration. Subsequent study days are defined by the number of consecutive calendar days 
thereafter. All subjects will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
follo wing signing of the I nformed Consent Form at screening and throughout the study until the FU visit (Days 
45-52 for subjects with candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without candidemia) for 
each treatment group. Vital signs (temperat ure, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) will be recorded 
daily while receiving IV study drug and at Day 4, Day 5, Day 14 (±1 day), Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects 
with IC), End -of-Treatment (EOT) (+2 days allowed after last dose of study drug ) and FU (Days 45 -52 for 
subjects with candidemia only or Days 52 -59 for subjects with IC, with or without candidemia). Hematology 
and chemistry laboratory tests will be performed at Screening; Days 2 and 4; Day 8, Day 14 (±1 day), EOT (+2 
days allowed aft er last dose of study drug), and at the FU visits. Coagulation laboratory tests (prothrombin 
time/international normalized ratio [PT/INR] and either partial thromboplastin time [PTT] or activated partial 
thromboplastin time [aPTT]) will be performed at Scr eening. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be performed at 
Screening (before subject randomization) and EOT (+2 days allowed after the last dose of study drug).  
Mycological diagnosis of candidemia or IC sufficient for inclusion in the study will be established  by a positive 
microbiological test for yeast or Candida within 96 hours from time of collection of the sample until 
randomization. Acceptable positive microbiological tests for yeast or  Candida include ≥1 blood culture 
positive for yeast or Candida, a Spo nsor-approved rapid IVD test positive for Candida spp, or a positive Gram 
stain for yeast or positive culture for Candida spp.  from a specimen obtained from a normally sterile site. If the 
positive blood culture used to qualify the subject for the study is  drawn >12 hours from randomization, then an 
additional set of blood cultures must be obtained ≤12 hours before randomization. Blood cultures should be 
performed daily (preferred) or every other day until 2 blood cultures drawn ≥12 hours apart are negative  
without an intervening positive culture. Generally, blood cultures should involve 2 separate draws with ≥1 
draw from a peripheral vein without an IV catheter. Two bottles should be filled from each draw site, totaling 4 
bottles for each set of blood cultu res. If possible, use 3 aerobic and 1 anaerobic bottle (if available at the site) 
for each blood culture set.   
In Part A only, blood samples will be collected for PK analysis from the OPPOSITE arm of the infusion on 
Day 1 (within 10 minutes before the end of infusion, between 15 minutes and 1 hour after the end of infusion, 
and between 2 hours and 12 hours after th e end of infusion), Day 2 (random draw, with safety labs if possible), 
Day 4 (random draw, with safety labs if possible), Day 8 (predose only), and Day 15 (predose only). If therapy 
is stopped on or before Day 14 and there is no Day 15 dose, then the Day 1 5 PK sample should be drawn with 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 5 of 128 
 the safety laboratory samples for the Day 14 visit. For the purpose of maintaining the blind, blood samples will 
be collected from all subjects, when possible, in all 3 treatment groups in Part A, but only PK samples from t he 
CD101 IV groups will be analyzed (using a validated assay) by an independent, central bioanalytical 
laboratory.  In part B, PK samples will not be collected.  
Overall success and mycological eradication will be assessed at Day 5, Day 14 (±1 day), Day 28 (±2 days; only 
for subjects with IC), and FU (Days 45 -52 for subjects with candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with 
IC, with or without candidemia). Clinical response will be assessed at Day 14 (±1 day), Day 28 (±2 days; only 
for subjects with IC), and FU (Days 45 -52 for subjects with candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with 
IC, with or without candidemia).  
Number of Subjects  
In Part A, subjects will be randomized (1:1:1)  until there are approximately 30 subjects in the CD101 IV 
treatment Group 1, 30 subjects in the CD101 IV treatment Group 2, and 30 subjects in the comparator group in 
the mITT population. It is expected that approximately 114 subjects will need to be randomized to achieve 90 
subjects in the mITT population (assuming 80% of  randomized subjects will be included in mITT population).  
In Part B, subjects will be randomized (2:1)  until there are ≥ 30 subjects in the CD101 IV treatment groups  and 
≥15 subjects in the comparator group ( ≥45 additional subjects and no more than 120 su bjects). Total enrollment 
will depend on the enrollment rate for the 6 - to 8-month period between the end of Part A and the staged start 
of the Phase 3 study , which is the trigger for the rolling close -out of Part B .

 Test Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration  
Rezafungin for injection is a sterile product of lyophilized powder in a single -use vial for reconstitution with 
sterile water for injection prior to dilution into normal saline infusion bags.  
Subjects randomized to the CD101 IV treatment Group 1 will receive 1 dose of CD101 IV (400 mg) on Day 1 
and Day 8 ( Table 1). Subjects in Group 1 who require >14 days of IV therapy will receive an optional third  
dose of CD101 IV (400 mg) on Day 15. Subjects in Group 1 with IC (with or without candidemia) who require 
>21 days of IV therapy will receive an optional fourth dose of CD101 IV (400 mg) on Day 22. Subjects in 
Group 1 will receive IV placebo on other stud y days in order to maintain the blind.  
Subjects randomized to the CD101 IV treatment Group 2 will receive 1 dose of CD101 IV 400 mg on Day 1 
and 200 mg on Day 8 ( Table 1). Subjects in Group 2 who require >14 days of IV therapy will receive an 
optional third dose of CD101 IV (200 mg) on Day 15. Subjects in Group 2 with IC (with or without 
candidemia) who require >21 days of IV therapy will receive an opti onal fourth dose of CD101 IV (200 mg) 
on Day 22. Subjects in Group 2 will receive IV placebo on other study days in order to maintain the blind.  
Intravenous infusion of CD101 IV is nominally over 60 (±10) minutes , but the time may be increased as 
needed up to 180  (±10) minutes to manage symptoms of infusion reaction consistent with management of 
echinocandin class infusion reactions, whereby decreasing the rate of infusion often alleviates symptoms . 
(Note: infusion must be completed within the 4 -hour stabil ity limit,  which starts at the time of reconstitution of 
rezafungin for injection  lyophilized powder in the single -use vial.) Intravenous study drug is administered 24 
(±2) hours after study drug was administered on the previous day. Dosage adjustments of CD101 IV are not 
allowed.  
Subjects  may receive oral step -down therapy after ≥3 days of IV therapy. Step -down therapy in both CD101 IV 
treatment groups  will be oral placebo, in order to maintain the blind . Subjects with creatinine clearance >50 
mL/min will receive oral placebo (4 capsules on the first day followed by 2 capsules/day thereafter) in the 
CD101 treatment group. Subjects with creatinine clearance ≤50 mL/min will receive oral placebo (2 capsules 
on the first day followed by 1 capsule /day thereafte r) in the CD101 treatment group. Subjects receiving 
hemodialysis will receive oral placebo (4 capsules on the first day followed by 2 capsules after each 
hemodialysis) in the CD101 treatment group. Subjects who have already switched to oral step -down thera py 
will receive both oral placebo and IV CD101 on Day 8, and if required on Day 15 and Day 22 for subjects who 
are administered study drug through these timepoints.  
Comparator  
Subjects randomized to the caspofungin group will receive IV caspofungin (a single 70 mg loading dose on 
Day 1 followed by 50 mg once daily) for ≥3 days and up to a maximum of 21 days for subjects with 
candidemia only and up to a maximum of 28 days for subjects with IC (with or without candidemia) ( Table 1). 
Intravenous infusion of caspofungin is nominally over 60 (±10) minutes , but the time may be increased as 
needed up to 180  (±10) minutes to manage symptoms of infusion reaction. Intravenous study drug is 
administered 24 (±2) hours after study drug was administered on the previous day.  
Use of concomitant cyclosporine should be limited to subjects for whom potential benefit outweighs potential 
risk of drug- drug interactions with c aspofungin.  
Subjects in the caspofungin group with moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh score of 7- 9 with a history 
of chronic cirrhosis ) will receive a loading dose of caspofungin of 70 mg on Day 1 and 35 mg/day thereafter. 
Subjects in the caspofungin group weighing >80 kg or on concomitant rifampin, nevirapine, efavirenz, 
phenytoin, dexamethasone, or carbamazepine may receive 70 mg caspofungin daily. Dose adjustment due to 
drug-drug interactions may be considered at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Subjects in Part A and Part B may receive oral step -down therapy after ≥3 days of IV therapy. Step -down 
therapy in the caspofungin treatment group  will be oral fluconazole. Subjects with creatinine clearance >50 
mL/min will receive oral fluconazole (a loading dose of 800 mg [4 capsules] on the first day followed by 400 
mg [2 capsules]/day thereafter) . Subjects in the caspofungin group with renal impairment who are switched to 
oral stepdown therapy may receive reduced doses of fluconazole. For subjects with creatinine clearance ≤50 
mL/min, the loading dose of fluconazole should be 400 mg [2 capsules] and the daily dose of fluconazole 
should be 200 [1 capsule] mg/day. For subjects receiving hemodialysis, the loading dose of fluconazole should 
be 800 mg [4 capsules ] followed by 400 mg [2 capsules] of fluconazole after each hemodialysis.  In order to 
maintain the blind, subjects who have already switched to oral step -down therapy will receive both oral 
fluconazole and IV placebo on Day 8, and if required on Day 15 and Day 22 for subjects who are administered 
study drug through these timepoints.

 Oral Step Down Therapy  
An oral step -down therapy is allowed in all treatment groups, provided the following criteria are met:  
• Able to take oral medication  
• ≥3 days of IV study drug 
• The Candida species isolated is susceptible to fluconazole.   
• The subject’s clinical status is considered stable based on Investigator assessment  
• If a blood culture is positive at Screening, 2 post -baseline blood cultures drawn ≥12 hours apart are 
negative for Candida spp. without an intervening positive culture , and the first of the 2 cultures was drawn 
≥48 hours prior to oral study drug initiation  
• No evidence of moderate or severe hepatic insuffici ency (alanine aminotransferase or aspartate 
aminotransferase >3× the upper limit of normal)  
• No history of hypersensitivity or any other contraindications to the use of fluconazole and, in the 
Investigator’s opinion, the subject can tolerate oral fluconazole therapy (refer to current fluconazole 
Prescribing Information )  
Oral step -down therapy will be fluconazole in the caspofungin group and oral placebo in the CD101 treatment 
groups.  
The total IV plus oral treatment duration will be ≥14 days and up to 28 da ys.

 Duration of Treatment  
Study participation will require from 45 to 52 days for subjects with candidemia only (or from 52- 59 days for 
subjects with IC, with or without candidemia) after the first dose of study drug; study drug administration from 
Day 1 up to Day 21 (for subjects with c andidemia) or up to Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC); safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy assessments up to Day 21 (for subjects with candidemia only) or up to Day 28 (±2 
days; only for subjects with IC); and a FU visit (Days 45 to 52 for subject s with candidemia only or Days 52-
59 days for subjects with IC, with or without candidemia).   
Criteria for Evaluation  
Efficacy  
Efficacy assessments will be recorded on Day 5, Day 14 (±1 day), Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC), 
and FU (Days 45 -52 for subjects with candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without 
candidemia)  
The primary efficacy endpoint is overall success  at Day 14 ( ±1 day), as defined below:  
• Mycological eradication defined as:  
o If positive blood culture at base line: 2 negative blood cultures drawn ≥12 hours apart without 
intervening positive blood cultures  
 
OR 
o If positive culture from a normally sterile site (other than blood):  
― Documented  mycological eradication: most recent culture on or prior to Day 14 (±1 day) from all 
normally sterile sites of baseline Candida infection (if accessible) is negative  
OR 
― Presumed  mycological eradication: follow -up culture is not available (eg, normally ste rile 
baseline site of Candida infection not accessible) in a subject with a successful clinical outcome 
(ie, did not receive rescue antifungal treatment and has resolution of systemic signs of IC that 
were present at baseline) and resolution or improvement  of any baseline radiographic 
abnormalities due to IC  
AND  
• Resolution of attributable systemic signs of candidemia and/or IC that were present at baseline  
AND  
• No change of antifungal therapy for the treatment of candidemia and/or IC  
AND  
• The subject is not  lost to follow up on the day of assessment  
 
Secondary efficacy outcome measures include:  
• Mycological eradication   
• Clinical cure as assessed by the Investigator   
Additional efficacy outcome measures include:  
• All-cause 30 -day mortality  
• Time to first of 2 negative blood cultures drawn ≥12 hours apart, without an intervening positive culture  
 
Safety  
Safety will be assessed from the signing of the I nformed Consent Form at Screening to the FU visit through the 
evaluation of AEs, vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate), ECGs, and clinical 
laboratory data (clinical chemistry panels, hematology evaluations, and urinalyses).

 Pharmacokinetics (Part A only) 
Blood samples will be obtained from subjects to evaluate the PK of CD101 IV. Blood samples will be collected 
for all 3 treatment groups for the purpose of maintaining the blind, but only PK samples from the CD101 IV 
groups will be analyzed by a central bioanalytical laboratory. When >1 assessment occurs at any time point,  the 
PK blood sample will be given priority and taken at the correct protocol -specified time. Plasma samples will be 
analyzed for the concentration of CD101 by a validated liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry 
method.  
Blood for PK analyses will be  drawn from the OPPOSITE arm of the infusion at the following times:  
On Day 1 (within 10 minutes [ie, >0 to 10 minutes] before the end of infusion, between 15 minutes and 1 hour 
after the end of infusion, and between 2 hours and 12 hours after the end of i nfusion), Day 2 (random draw with 
date of sample same as Day 2 date of dose, with safety labs if possible), Day 4 (random draw with date of 
sample same as Day 4 date of dose, with safety labs if possible), Day 8 (predose only), and Day 15 (predose 
only). D ay 8 and Day 15 PK draws should be performed within 30 minutes before the second and third dose of 
study drug, regardless of the exact day and time of these infusions. If therapy is stopped on or before Day 14 
and there is no Day 15 dose, then the Day 15 P K sample should be drawn with the safety laboratory samples 
for the Day 14 visit. Ideally, PK samples would be drawn with the safety laboratory samples for that day to 
prevent multiple needle sticks.  
Statistical Methods  
The study is not powered for infere ntial statistical analysis. A sufficient number of subjects are randomized to 
the CD101 IV and caspofungin groups in Part A to provide an initial, substantive analysis of safety and 
tolerability, and estimate efficacy. In Part A, assuming a 73% overall success rate, the sample size of 30 
subjects in each CD101 IV gro up will yield a 95% confidence interval ( CI) of 53.8% to 87.5%. With the 
addition of Part B subjects and assuming a 73% overall success rate, a  total approximate sample size of 60 
subjects in th e CD101 treatment group  (consisting of Group 1 from Amendment 5 and Group 2 from 
Amendment 6 ) will yield a 95% CI of  60.0% to 83.7%, and a total approximate sample size of 1 10 subjects in 
the CD101 treatment group   (consisting of Group 1 from Amendment 5 and Group 2 from Amendment 6) will 
yield  a 95% CI of 63.7% to 81.0% . 
Analysis populations are:  
• The Intent -to-treat (ITT) population : all randomized subjects  
• The Safety population : all subjects who received any amou nt of study drug 
• The Microbiological Intent -to-treat population (mITT) : all subjects who had documented Candida  infection 
based on  Central Laboratory evaluation of a blood culture obtained within 96 hours of randomization, or 
from a specimen obtained from a normally sterile site, and received ≥1 dose of study drug  
To demonstrate prelimi nary efficacy and safety of CD101  and to confirm the correct CD101 dose regimen is 
utilized  in Part B , an unblinded  interim analysis will be performed after approximately 40 to 60 subjects in the 
mITT population have been enrolled and completed study drug  therapy.  This unblinded interim analysis of a 
few key efficacy and safety outcomes will be performed by an independent unblinded statistician.  Interim 
efficacy and safety su mmary tables wi ll be produced,  but the identity of the group assignment for each 
individual subject will remain blinded until the completion of the study and the database for both Parts A and B 
are locked. Once Part A is completed , the database will be loc ked and a full unblinded analysis with all 
summary tables will be performed on Part A alone.  As with the initial interim analysis  and to help avoid bias , 
the full Part A analysis will be performed by an independent unblinded statistician , keeping the identity of the 
group assignment for eac h individual subject  blinded until the completion of the study and the database for both 
Parts A and B are locked . (Note: An addendum to the Unblinding Plan for Part A allowed for unblinded safety 
review of adverse e vents of interest identified during  blinded safety review; the addendum allowed for no more 
than 5% of subject s to be unblinded.)  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before the interim analysis.  Any changes to the 
SAP from the time of the interim analysis  to the final database lock  of Part B  will be documented in an 
addendum to the SAP.  Any deviations from the final SAP /addendum  will be described and justified in the 
study report. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS®. All analyses will be completed for Part A. 
Selected analyses will be completed only for Part B and for Part A and B combined.  
The primary efficacy outcome is overall response and is determined programmatically from the mycological 
response and assessment of systemic signs of infection attributable to candidemia and/or IC at Day 14 (±1 day).

 The number and percentage of subjects with a success, failur e, or indeterminate will be presented by treatment 
group. Two -sided 95% CIs for the point estimates of success in the mITT population will be determined. 
Analyses will be completed for Part A, Part B , and combined Part A and B.  
Safety will be evaluated by presenting summaries of AEs, clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology 
evaluation, chemistry panel, urinalysis), vital signs, and ECGs. Safety variables will be tabulated and presented 
for all subjects by study drug. Adverse events will be coded using th e Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that occurs during or 
after study drug administration and up through the FU visit. The incidence of TEAEs will be presented by 
system org an class and preferred term, by relationship to study drug, by severity, and by whether or not they 
resulted in alteration of administration of or discontinuation of study drug (IV and IV/oral). In addition, the 
incidence of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading  to discontinuation of study drug (IV and IV/oral) will be 
presented by system organ class and preferred term. Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory test results, 
vital signs, and ECG parameters, including changes from baseline, will be presented by time point. Incidences 
of potentially clinically significant clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECG parameters, as defined in the 
SAP, will also be summarized by time point.  Analyses will be completed for Part A and for combined Part A 
and B.  
In Part A only, PK parameter assessment will be reported separately for the PK Analysis population and may 
include: maximum plasma concentration (C max), time to C max, and area under the curve, if applicable.

a. Study Day 1 is the first day of study drug administration; s ubsequent study days are consecutive calendar days.  
b. The time windows on Study Day 8, 14, 15, 22, and 28  visits apply only to  subjects already stepped down to oral therapy  and discharged from the study site.  
c. Continue study drug therapy and assessments if further therapy is clinically indicated; only for subjects with IC (with or without candidemia). Subjects will 
be presumed to have IC if there is a positive culture for Candida spp. from a normally sterile site other than blood or if there is a positive sponsor -approved 
rapid IVD or blood culture for Candida spp. combined with radiographic evidenc e of IC.  
d. The Day 28 visit is only  for subjects with IC (with or without candidemia). Note that the Day 28 (±2 days) visit could be the same visit as the EOT visit if 
the subject receives ≥ 26 days of therapy.  
e. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to initiating any study related a ssessments or procedures.  
f. Medical history for the last 5 years and Candida risk factors for the last 3 months (eg, central line, active malignancy, broad -spectrum antibiotic therapy, 
diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, major surgery, total parenteral nut rition, transplant recipient, trauma, dialysis, burn s, pancreatitis ) and Intensive Care 
Unit admission and discharge (if applicable). Short- term central venous catheters (eg, peripherally -inserted central catheters, internal jugular or subclavian 
central v enous catheters) and long -term central venous catheters (eg, tunneled catheters) are recommended to be removed within 48 hours after diagnosis 
with candidemia, consistent with IDSA and ESCMID guidelines  
g. Physical exams are required at Screening, on Day 14, Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC), and at the FU visit. Height is recorded at Screening. 
Weight is recorded at Screening, on Day 14, and at the FU visit. If a physical exam is performed at any other visit, abnormal  findings that represent a new o r 
worsening condition as compared to baseline should be recorded as an adverse event.  
h. Calculate Child -Pugh score o nly if the subject has a history of chronic cirrhosis  
i. APACHE II score can be calculated after enrollment , but should use the vital signs and laboratory results from the Screening visit.  
j. If hospitalized, record the range of vital signs; highest and lowest daily temperature and the method used (oral, rectal, tem poral, tympanic, or core), highest 
and lowest heart rate, highest and lowest respiratory rate, and highest and lowest blood pressure measured. If not hospitalized, record single measurements 
for daily temperature and the method used (oral, rectal, temporal, tympanic, or core), heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure.  
k. For subjects discharged from the hospital and in the community, vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) are only performed on 
Days 6 -28 if the subject is seen for clinical assessment or IV study dru g infusion  
l. ECG must be conducted before subject randomization.  
m. If radiologic test performed, record radiologic test type with Findings and Interpretation only if radiologic test provides e vidence of IC, OR evidence of 
resolution of IC from previous radiogr aphs.  
n. In general, the laboratory values to be entered into the electronic case report form will be from the first laboratory samples drawn each day with routine 
morning laboratory samples.

caspofungin group and oral placebo (4 capsules on the first day followed by 2 capsules/day thereafter) in the CD101 groups.  
aa. Record all systemic antifungal therapy administered within 4 weeks and all non -antifungal therapy administered within 1 week prior to randomization 
Record concomitant antimicrobial agents, including  all antifungal agents at each study visit.  
bb. Adverse events are collected following signing of the I nformed Consent  Form at Screening through the last study visit (FU)  
cc. Perform identification and susceptibility testing at local laboratory for Candida for an y positive blood culture or positive culture from a specimen obtained 
from a normally sterile site at Screening and for any positive culture requiring a change of antifungal therapy (ie, identifi cation and susceptibility testing not 
required for Candida isolates cultured from specimens obtained on other study days without a required change in antifungal therapy ). 
dd. Blood for culture must be obtained as part of the standard of care for inclusion in the study. Established mycological diagnosis of candidemia and /or IC 
sufficient for in clusion in the study is defined as ≥1 blood culture positive for yeast or Candida, a Sponsor -approved rapid IVD test positive for Candida spp, 
or a positive Gram stain for yeast or positive culture for Candida spp.  from a specimen obtained from a normally sterile site ≤96 hours before randomization. 
Record species and susceptibilities for all bacteria isolated within 1 week prior to randomization  from blood or any other normally sterile site . If the positive 
blood c ulture used to qualify the subject for the study is drawn >12 hours from randomization, then an additional set of blood cultu res must be obtained ≤12 
hours before randomizat ion.  
ee. Obtain blood and/or normally sterile tissue/fluid for culture if demonstratin g mycological eradication or if clinically indicated. Blood cultures should be 
repeated daily (preferred) or every other day until 2 negative blood cultures are obtained ≥12 hours apart, without an interv ening positive culture. All fungal 
isolates cultured  from blood and normally sterile tissue/fluid from Screening through the last study visit must be sent to the Central Laborato ry. Record the 
species and susceptibilities for any new bacteria isolated from blood or any other norm ally sterile site.

Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 20 of 128 ff. Obtain blood for culture  at FU . If feasible, and if there was a previous culture from a site positive for Candida spp., obtain culture from normally sterile 
tissue/fluid from the same site. All fungal isolates cultured from blood and normally sterile tissue/fluid  from Screening through the last study visit must be 
sent to the Central Laboratory. Record the species and susceptibilities for any new bacteria isolated from blood or any other  normally sterile site.  
gg. Overall success for subjects with candidemia occurs if 2 blood cultures are negative and ≥12 hours apart without intervening positive blood cultures, there 
was no change of antifungal therapy for the treatment of candidemia, and signs attributable to candi demia at baseline have resolved; blood cultures are 
drawn daily until the subject qualifies as a success. Success for subjects with IC (with or without candidemia) occurs if neg ative culture from a normally 
sterile site is either documented or presumed, th ere was no change of antifungal therapy for the treatment of IC, and signs attributable to IC at baseline have 
resolved: documented mycological eradication occurs if most recent culture on or prior to the day of assessment from all norm ally sterile sites o f baseline 
Candida infection (if accessible) is negative; presumed mycological eradication occurs if follow -up culture is not available (eg, normally sterile baseline site 
of Candida infection not accessible) in a subject with a successful clinical outcome (ie, did not receive rescue antifungal treatment and has resolution of 
systemic signs of IC) and resolution or improvement of any baseline radiographic abnormalities due to IC.  
hh. The Screening period for assessing systemic signs for inclusion in the study m ay include the 4 hours prior to the drawing of the qualifying positive blood 
culture  (when systemic signs of infection resulted in obtaining blood cultures ), qualifying positive culture from a sterile site, or qualifying rapid in vitro 
diagnostic , through enrollment.  
ii. On Day 5, assess presence or absence of systemic signs only (ie, not symptoms) and determine which are attributable to candid emia and/or IC  
jj. Principal Investigator to assess if the subject is a cure, indeterminate, or failure based on the criter ia in Table  11; there is a specific electronic case report 
form page for completion of this assessment.  
kk. In Part A only, obtain blood for PK sampling from the OPPOSITE arm of the infusion on Day 1 (within 10 minutes [ie, >0 to 10 minutes] before the end of 
infusion, between 15 minutes and 1 hour after the end of infusion, and between 2 hours and 12 hours after the end of infusion ), Day 2 (random draw wi th 
date of sample same as Day 2 date of dose, with safety labs if possible), Day 4 (random draw with date of sample same as Day 4 date of dose, with safety 
labs if possible), Day 8 (predose only), and Day 15 (predose only). Day 8 and Day 15 PK draws should be performed within 30 minutes before the second 
and third dose of study drug, regardless of the exact day and time of these infusions. If therapy is stopped on or before Day  14 and there is no Day 15 dose, 
then the Day 15 PK sample should be drawn with t he safety laboratory samples for the Day 14 visit. Ideally, PK samples would be drawn with the safety 
laboratory samples for that day to prevent multiple needle sticks.

 4.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
4.1 CANDIDEMIA AND INVAS IVE CANDIDIASIS  
Intravenous CD101 (CD101 IV), a new echinocandin antifungal agent, is being 
developed specifically to treat patients with systemic infections caused by Candida. 
These serious and life -threatening infections represent a significant public health issue, 
particularly in highly vulnerable patient populations such as the elderly, postsurgical, 
critically ill, and other hospitalized patients with serious medical conditions ( Magill et al., 
2014; Andes et al., 2012; Wisplinghoff et al., 2004). In addition, because of increasing 
resistance to existing antifungal drugs, there is an urgent need to develop new and more 
effective antifungal agents to treat these serious infections ( Alexander et al., 2013; 
Arendr up et al., 2013; Ostrosky -Zeichner 2013; Pfaller, 2012). The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) recently warned that fluconazole -resistant Candida have 
the potential to pose  a serious threat to public health ( CDC, 2013; CDC , 2016). However, 
since 2007, no new antifungal agents have been approved for treatment of candidemia 
(The White House , 2014; Executive Office of the President, 2014; CDC, 2013).  
Candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis (IC) (eg, disseminated candidiasis, 
peritonitis, intra -abdominal abscess, hepatic c andidiasis, endocarditis, and meningitis) are 
considered to be among the most critical invasive fungal infections in the United States 
(US) in terms of incidence and impact ( Brown et al., 2012; Pfaller and Diekema, 2010 ; 
Arendrup et al. 2013; Azie et al., 2012; Menzin et al., 2009; Vincent et al., 2009). In a 
recent analysis of  a large US patient database, Candida infections accounted for 40% of 
all invasive fungal infections and were associated with the highest excess length of stay, 
excess cost, and attributable mortality ( Menzin et al., 2009). In  fact, the mortality rate in 
patients with candidemia has been reported to be >40%, which is higher than that for 
some populations with invasive aspergillosis ( Andes, et al. 2012; Wisplinghof f et al., 
2004; Mikulska et al., 2012; Falagas et al., 2006; Labelle et al., 2008 ; Pfaller and 
Diekema, 2010; Slavin et al., 2010; Mylonakis et al., 2015; Pfaller and Diekema, 2007 ).  
The US National Center for Health Statistics reported that the incidence of Candida 
infection is 8/100,000 population per year, but estimates range up to 26/100,000 in 
certain regions of the US, and the incidence continues to increase ( Brown et al., 2012; 
Pfaller and Diekema, 2010 ; Menzin et al., 2009; Vincent et al., 2009; Cleveland et al., 
2012; Zilberberg et al., 2008a ; Zilberberg et al., 2008b). In 2004, Candida was the fourth 
leading cause of healthcare- associated bloodstream infections overall ( Wisplinghoff et 
al., 2004). In 2008, the National Healthcare Safety Network reported that C andida was 
the third most common cause of central line –associated bloodstream infections in US 
intensive care units ( Hidron et al., 2008). However, the most recent survey reported that 
Candida was now the most common cause of hospital -acquired bloodstream infections in 
the US ( Magill et al., 2014). Even more disturbing is that some of the highest rates of 
Candida infection have been observed among elderly hospitalized patients ( Zaoutis et al., 
2005; Zilberberg et al., 2008b).

Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 29 of 128 
 More than 50% of all Candida infections are caused by non -albicans Candida species, 
including Candida glabrata, which is the most common non- albicans Candida sp ecies in 
North America and Europe. The incidence of infections caused by C. glabrata in the US 
has increased by >4 fold over the past 20 years ( Cleveland et al., 2012). In the US -based 
SENTRY Antifungal Surveillance Program , the frequency of C. glabrata as a cause of 
bloodstream infections recently increased from 18% in 2008/2009 to 25% in 2010/2011 
(Pfaller et al., 2014 ). Azole -resistant C. glabrata has recently been identified as a serious 
threat to public health ( The White House, 2014; Executive Office of the President, 2014; 
CDC, 2013). In the US -based SE NTRY Antifungal Surveillance Program, the rate of 
azole- resistant C. glabrata has recently increased from 9% in the 1992- 2001 time period 
to 14% in the 2001- 2007 time period ( Pfaller et al., 2014; 2013; 2012; 2010a , 2010b, 
2009), but it has been reported to be as high as 30% in some centers ( Alexander et al., 
2013).  
The increasing incidence of non- albicans Candida  and the greater efficacy of 
echinocandins compared to azoles in Candida infections provided support for the 
recommendation in Infectious Disease s Society of America (IDSA) and Eu ropean 
Society Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines that an 
echinocandin be used for initial treatment of candidemia ( Pappas et al., 2016; Ullmann et 
al., 2012; Cornely et al., 2012). These guidelines allow for a subsequent “step- down” to 
an azole for treatment, if the Candida species has been identified and has been 
demonstrated to be susceptible to the azole. However, not all US hospitals are currently 
able to perform antifungal susceptibility testing, making it difficult for many hospitals to 
follow this recommendation. In t he context of increasing rates of azole- resistant C. 
glabrata, the current treatment regimen would be ≥2 weeks of a daily echinocandin.  
Moreover, because of its haploid genome, C. glabrata has the potential to more rapidly 
develop resistance to antifungal agents than other Candida spp. in multiple drug classes, 
including echinocandins ( Ostrosky -Zeichner, 2013; Pfaller et al., 2 012, 2008). 
Echinocandins inhibit the 1,3- β-D-glucan synthase (encoded by FKS1 , FKS2 , and FKS3  
genes), which synthesizes a major component of the fungal cell wall. Mutations in “hot 
spot” regions of FKS1  and/or FKS2  are associated with elevated echinocandin minimal 
inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, reduced glucan synthase enzyme sensitivity, and 
unfavorable outcomes in animal models ( Beyda et al., 2014; Alexand er et al., 2013). FKS  
mutations have been identified in 8% to 32% of patients with C. glabrata candidemia, 
particularly in patients with prior echinocandin exposure. FKS  mutations have been 
associated with higher clinical failure rates compared to non -FKS mutants (60% vs 23%) 
(Beyda et al., 2014; Shields et al., 2013). In fact, in a recently reported case series, the 
clinical failure rate among patients with echinocandin -resistant C. glabrata was r eported 
to be 91% ( Shields et al., 2013).  
The emergence of multidrug resistance in C. glabrata can be considered a major public 
health issue because neither the azoles nor the currently available echinocandins would 
be appropriate for treatment, and high dose amphotericin is the only alternative and is 
associated with renal toxicity, particularly in older, critically -ill patients with sepsis 
(Alexander and Wingard, 2005;  Chapeland -Leclerc et al., 2010 ; Krogh -Madsen et al., 
2006; Pappas et al., 2016).

 4.2 CD101  
CD101 is a semi -synthetic echinocandin that inhibits the synthesis of 1,3- β-D-glucan, an 
essential component of the fungal cell wall of yeast forms of Candida species and regions 
of active cell growth of Aspergillus hyphae. The synthesis of 1,3- β-D-glucan is dependent 
upon the activity of 1,3 -β-D-glucan synthase, an enzyme complex in which the catalytic 
subunit is encoded by FKS1 , FKS2 , and FKS3  genes. Inhibition of this enzyme results in 
rapid, concentration- dependent, fungicidal activity for Candida spp.  
CD101 is a broad- spectrum antifungal agent with excellent activity against w ild-type and 
azole-  and echinocandin- resistant strains of Candida spp. ( Castanheira et al., 2014). 
CD101 demonstrated potent activity against representative strains of numerous fungal 
species, including Candida spp., Aspe rgillus  spp., Trichophyton mentagrophytes , 
Trichophyton rubrum , and Microsporum gypseum , similar to that of anidulafungin. Poor 
activity was observed for single strains of Cryptococcus neoformans  and Rhizopus 
oryzae , characteristic of echinocandins. When t ested against multiple clinical isolates of 
wild-type and echinocandin -resistant and/or –azole resistant Candida spp., CD101 
activity was similar to that of anidulafungin versus all strains tested with MIC required to 
inhibit the growth of 90% of the isola tes tested (MIC 90) values ≤1 µg/mL for all species 
except Candida parapsilosis , which was 2 µg/mL. The potency of CD101 against strains 
with documented fks  mutations was 2 - to 8- fold greater than that of caspofungin and 
similar to that of anidulafungin.  
4.3 NONCLINICAL PHARMACOLO GY AND TOXICOLOGY 
CD101 was found to be stable in liver microsomes from all species tested. A cross -
species stability study also determined that CD101 is stable in intestinal microsomes 
and no metabolic products were identified during i ncubations of CD101 with mouse, 
rat, monkey, or human liver microsomes, indicating a lack of biotransformation. In 
vivo, metabolite profiling of rat plasma and excreta samples is consistent with in vitro 
results confirming the lack of biotransformation.  
The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CD101 was investigated in mice, rats, dogs, 
cynomolgus monkeys, and chimpanzees following IV delivery, the intended clinical 
route of administration, and also after intraperitoneal administration to mice, 
intramuscular to rats, subcutaneous to rats and cynomolgus monkeys, and orally to 
dogs, monkeys, and chimpanzees. CD101 consistently exhibited very low clearance, 
modest volume of distribution (V z) or volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), 
and long half -life (t 1/2). Across all species tested, CD101 exhibited a favorable PK 
profile, mainly attributable to lower clearance (resulting in a longer t 1/2). Additionally, 
there was low to no drug accumulation or gender differences found with CD101 
across all species tested after multiple doses and routes of administration.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 31 of 128 
 Tissue distribution of CD101 was evaluated in rats and mean area under the 
concentration time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the final sample (AUC 0-t) was lowest in 
brain tissue and highest in kidney tissue. Calculation of tissue/plasma AUC ratios 
indicated exposure relative to plasma was comparable between major organs (4 - to 5- fold 
higher in kidney, lung, liver, and spleen) with the exception of much lower ratios in tissue 
from heart and brain (≤1). More importantly, CD101 appears to concentrate within fungal 
lesions even after the majority of drug has been cleared from an infected organ, as shown 
in a separate study by David Perlin and colleagues from Rutgers ( Zhao, 201 7). In the 
study, the authors utilized matrix -assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging 
mass spectrometry technology to image kidney and liver cross -sections of mice with IC. 
MALDI imaging allowed for multiplexed analysis of different molecules simultaneou sly 
in the same tissue section, providing semi -quantitative information of fungal lesions and 
drug localization. From cross -sections of liver and kidney, across different timepoints 
from 1 to 48 hours, Perlin and colleagues noted that CD101 tissue levels begin to decline 
after reaching the maximum plasma concentration (C max) at 6 hours postdose, but 
increase and concentrate within fungal lesions at later timepoints (24 and 48 hours).  
CD101 has been evaluated in a full battery of Investigational New Drug (I ND)-enabling 
toxicology studies up to 4 weeks in duration in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, and in 
bacterial and mammalian cell in vitro genetic toxicology studies. The pivotal nonclinical 
safety studies were conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidances. 
CD101was evaluated in single dose and exploratory IV studies, in 2- week IV pilot 
toxicity studies, and in 4- week IV GLP toxicity studies. In addition, 3 Screening and 
investigative studies were conducted: one study compared the toxicity of  CD101 to the 
marketed echinocandin, anidulafungin, with focus on assessing hepatotoxicity; a second 
study investigated different modes of IV tail vein administration in rats; and the third 
study measured plasma levels of histamine in rats.  
The main toxico logy finding was a rat -specific histamine -release response that occurred 
primarily after the first dose. This histamine response was not seen in cynomolgus 
monkeys at C max levels that exceeded those where these effects were seen in rats. 
Echinocandins as a  class are known to cause histamine release during infusions in rats, 
but not during infusions in monkeys when assessed during toxicity testing ( Eraxis 
[anidulafungin] New Drug Application [NDA] , Cancidas [caspofungin acetate]  NDA) . 
Rats appear to be much more sensitive to histamine -release responses of echinocandins 
versus primates, including humans where histamine -mediated infusion reactions appear 
to be uncommon ( Eraxis [anidulafungin] Prescribi ng Information, 2013; Mycamine 
[micafungin sodium] Prescribing Information, 2013; Cancidas [caspofungin acetate] 
Prescribing Information, 2014).  
Hematological signs suggestive of red blood cel l regeneration occurred in rats primarily 
at the high dose, were not considered adverse, and were not seen in monkeys.  
Local vascular injury was observed in rats, but adverse effects were confined to high dose 
males during the 4 -week toxicity study; the no -observed- adverse- effect level (NOAEL) 
concentration for local injury is 6 mg/mL.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 32 of 128 
 The safety margins appear to be large in rats and monkeys administered CD101 for up to 
4 weeks. The NOAEL for human relevant toxicities is 45 mg/k g in rats and 30 mg/kg in 
monkeys. These doses generate AUC plasma exposures 20- fold (rat) and 28 -fold 
(monkey) over the efficacious plasma exposure determined in the neutropenic mouse 
systemic candidiasis model.  
No adverse CD101- related target organ toxi city was observed in either rats or monkeys 
over the 4- week dosing period.  
A CD101 -related microscopic finding was seen in macrophages located in the lung of 
rats at ≥15 mg/kg that was characterized as a minimal alveolar histiocytosis. This change 
was not  considered adverse since it was minimal, not associated with tissue injury, and 
reversible. This change was not observed in monkeys.  
Of importance is the lack of microscopic evidence for target organ toxicity previously 
identified in animals with marketed  echinocandins dosed over a 4 - or 5-week period 
(Eraxis [anidulafungin] NDA , Cancidas [caspofungin acetate] NDA , Mycamine 
[micafungin sodium] NDA ). Target organs have included hepatotoxicity (anidulafungin, 
caspofungin and micafungin), renal toxicity (anidulafungin and micafungin), and skeletal 
muscle changes (anidulafungin). In addition, no CD101- related histopathological changes 
were seen in the spleen and bone marrow, whereas regenerative changes in these organs 
have been reported for anidulafungin and m icafungin  
CD101 was negative for mutagenicity (bacteria) and clastogenicity (mammalian cells) 
during in vitro genetic toxicology studies and negative for clastogenicity in the in vivo 
bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats at doses up to 45 mg/kg IV.  
The r esults from the female fertility study in rats indicate no effects on reproductive 
performance and intrauterine survival up to the highest dose tested (45 mg/kg). Embryo-
fetal development studies in female rats (up to 45 mg/kg) and rabbits (up to 35 mg/kg)  
have been conducted and demonstrated no effects on fetal growth, survival, or fetal 
morphology.  
In a fertility study in male rats, no rezafungin -related effects were seen on reproductive 
performance up to the highest dose tested (45 mg/kg), dose -related l ower mean sperm 
motility, concentration, and/or increased incidence  of abnormal sperm morphology, along 
with microscopic findings of testicular seminiferous tubular epithelial degeneration 
associated with an effect on spermiation were noted at ≥ 30 mg/kg. Based on these data, 
the NOAEL for male reproductive toxicity was 15 mg/kg , which is approximately 2- 5 
fold over steady state following IV 200 mg weekly preceded by an IV loading dose of 
400 mg .  Based on the lack of any effects on intrauterine survival in  females at any 
dosage level, the NOAEL for early embryonic toxicity was 45 mg/kg, the highest dose 
evaluated.

Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 33 of 128 
 In a 3 -month study in monkeys, during the sixth week of dosing, unexpected intention 
tremors were observed. Throughout the 3 -month dosing period, dose -related incidence of 
sporadic slight to moderate tremors/intention tremors were seen at ≥ 30 mg/kg  (30 mg/kg 
is 11- fold versus the Group 2 dose regimen) . Tremors were typically seen during dosing 
days at or around the time of infusion and intention t remors were observed periodically 
on both dosing and nondosing days. The incidence of tremors and intention tremors 
reversed for most animals, but intention tremors were seen in one male at the high dose 
(60 mg/kg) near the end of the recovery period. Due to the observed neurobehavioral 
effects, a detailed neuropathology assessment was performed which identified 
axonal/nerve fiber degeneration of peripheral nerves and sensory ganglia, along with 
prominent Schwann cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy primarily withi n the sensory ganglia, at 
≥ 30 mg/kg. Schwann cell changes reversed, but axonal/nerve fiber degeneration was still 
present at the end of the 4- week recovery period. No other test article -related microscopic 
changes were observed, including no test article -related effects in neurons of the sensory 
ganglia and in structures within the spinal cord or brain, including cerebellum. Although 
slight increases in serum calcium were observed at ≥ 30 mg/kg, an extensive evaluation 
of calcium homeostasis (i.e., ionized calcium, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone) failed to 
associate the minor increase in serum calcium to the observed neuropathological changes. 
Given the prominent Schwann hyperplasia/hypertrophy, it is not clear whether the 
axonal/nerve fiber degenerative changes are primary or secondary to an effect on the 
Schwann cells. The NOAEL level for neuropathology in monkeys is 10 mg/kg , which is 
approximately 4 -fold over  the estimated steady state plasma level in humans at 200 mg.  
Results from a phototoxicity study  in rats indicate evidence of phototoxicity at elevated 
CD101 exposures. Relative to the repeat -dose human plasma C max level at 400 mg, the 
NOAEL for phototoxicity was 1.7- fold higher and the lowest -observed -adverse- effect 
level, where minimal changes were seen, was 3.6- fold higher. Review of the human 
safety data for CD101 and the medical literature for echinocandins indicate no evidence 
of phototoxicity. Results of a Phase 1 phototoxicity study in healthy human volunteers to 
elucidate the true risk of phototoxicity in subjects are pending . 
 
Additional nonclinical data is available in the Investigator Brochure.  
4.4 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
CD101 Injection was safe and well tolerated as a single dose up to 400 mg and multiple 
doses up to 400 mg. The overall safety, tolerability, and PK profile of CD101 support 
continued development as a once -weekly therapy for invasive fungal infections. 
A Phase 1, single -center, randomized, double -blind, single -ascending dose (SAD) study 
of CD101 administered by IV injection to heal thy adult subjects ( CD101.IV.1.01) has 
completed. The primary objective was to determine the safety, tolerability, and PK 
profile of CD101. In this study, subjects in 4 cohorts of 8 subjects (6 active, 2 placebo) 
each were randomized to receive single IV d oses of CD101 Injection or placebo (normal 
saline) infused over 60 (±10) minutes. Dose levels of CD101 assessed follow an 
ascending single- dose regimen (50, 100, 200, or 400 mg).

 A total of 32 subjects were randomized with 31 subjects completing all study 
assessments. One subject prematurely withdrew for personal reasons unrelated to safety 
or tolerability. Subjects were primarily White (97%), Hispanic (94%), and males and 
females were approximately equally represented (53% and 47%, respectively). There 
were no serious adverse events (SAEs), severe adverse events (AEs), or dose- response 
relationships for overall AEs. The majority of AEs were mild, and all AEs completely 
resolved by the end of the study. There were no drug -related AEs resulting from 
clinically significant hematology or clinical chemistry laboratory abnormalities at any 
dose. In addition, there were no safety issues related to electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital 
signs, or  physical exam findings.  
A Phase 1, single -center, randomized, double -blind, multiple -ascending dose (MAD) 
study of CD101 administered by IV injection to healthy adult subjects ( CD101.IV.1.02) 
has completed. The primary objective was to determine the safety, tolerability, and PK 
profile of CD101 when administered IV as multiple doses to healthy adult subjects. In 
this study, subjects in 3 cohorts of 8 subjects (6 active, 2 placebo) each were randomized 
to receive multiple IV doses of CD101 Injection or pla cebo (normal saline) infused over 
60 (±10) minutes. Dose levels of CD101 assessed follow an ascending multiple -dose 
regimen (100 mg ×2 doses, 200 mg ×2 doses, or 400 mg ×3 doses).  
A total of 24 subjects were randomized and all subjects completed the study . Subjects 
were primarily White (88%), Hispanic or Latino (88%), and had a mean body mass index 
(BMI) of 27.208 kg/m2 and a mean age of 42.8 years. Males and females were equally 
represented (50% each). There were no SAEs or severe AEs. The majority of AEs  were 
mild, and all related AEs completely resolved by the end of the study. Four subjects in 
the CD101 group experienced mild, transient infusion reactions, characterized by 
flushing, sensation of warmth, nausea, and chest tightness. These infusion reacti ons were 
associated primarily with the 400 mg dose cohort and were most common with the third 
dose. These reactions occurred within minutes of infusion initiation and disappeared 
within minutes without interruption or discontinuation of the study drug infusion. There 
were no drug -related AEs resulting from clinically significant hematology or clinical 
chemistry laboratory abnormalities at any dose. In addition, there were no safety issues 
related to ECGs, vital signs, or physical exam findings.  
The safety and efficacy of rezafungin for injection is being evaluated in this Phase  2, 
multicenter, prospective, randomized, double -blind, comparator study (IV caspofungin 
with option for oral fluconazole step- down therapy) for the treatment of subjects with 
candidem ia and/or invasive candidiasis. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 
2 rezafungin for injection once  weekly regimens or a daily IV caspofungin regimen with 
the option for oral fluconazole step- down therapy. Two rezafungin for injection dosing 
regimens were evaluated as follows: Group 1 was administered 400 mg ×2 weekly doses 
with a third optional weekly dose of 400 mg for all subjects and a fourth optional weekly 
dose 400 mg dose  for subjects with invasive candidiasis; Group 1 was administered 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 35 of 128 
 400 mg ×1  weekly dose followed by 200 mg  ×1 weekly dose with a third optional weekly 
dose of 200 mg for all subjects and a fourth optional weekly dose of 200 mg for subjects 
with invasive candidiasis. The reference therapy caspofungin regimen was as follows:  
70 mg ×1  day and 50 mg/day for 13 days  with  additional optional dosing 50 mg/day up to 
21 days for all subjects  and additional optional dosing 50 mg/day up to 28 days for 
patients with invasive candidiasis . 
In Part A of this Phase 2 study, t here were 107 subjects enrolled; 56.1% were male, most 
subjects were White (83%) with other identified races of Black or African American 
(11.2%) and Asian (3.7%). Ethnicity was primarily Not Hispanic/Latino (87.9%). Mean 
age was approximately 52  years. Diagnosis at stu dy entry was 89.7% candidemia and 
10.3%  invasive candidiasis with reasonable balance across the treatment groups. The 
study demonstrated efficacy for rezafungin for injection comparable to standard of care at 
Day 14 for all endpoints. There are no notable imbalances in TEAEs across the study 
groups. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. There were no notable 
imbalances in SAEs across the treatment groups and SAEs observed were not unexpected 
for the patient population. AEs of interest included those potentially representative of 
photosensitivity (results of Phase 1 photosensitivity study is pending) and neuropathy . 
One subject in a rezafungin for injection group had an AE of sunburn (Group 1) 
following substantial sun exposure . AEs in the re zafungin for injection groups potentially 
representing neuropathy were intensive care unit acquired weakness (Group 2, 1 subject, 
moderate severity), and tremor (Group 2, 1 subject, mild). An AE of intensive care unit 
acquired weakness also occurred in 1  subject receiving caspofungin (severe) and an AE 
of polyneuropathy (severe) occurred in 1 subject receiving caspofungin. These AEs of 
interest potentially representing study drug -related tremor/ ataxia/ neuropathy were 
followed until resolution; all resolved. The Investigator Brochure  should be referenced 
for additional information . 
4.5 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y 
The PK of CD101 has been well -characterized in healthy subjects for doses up to 400 mg 
for 3 weeks in the 2 Phase 1 studies: CD101.IV.1.01 (SAD study) and CD101.IV.1.02 
(MAD study).  
4.5.1 Single Ascending Dose Pharmacokinetics (CD101.IV.1.01)  
Pharmacokinetics was determined by analyzing plasma and urine samples for 
concentration of CD101 obtained from subjects who received CD101 Injection in each 
cohort at various time points after administration of the single dose of the study drug.  
The plasma PK of CD101 was generally well -characterized following the 50, 100, 200, 
and 400 mg CD101 doses. Exposure to CD101 incr eased with increasing CD101 doses 
(Table 3). Time to reach C max (ie, T max) was observed at the end of infusion, as expected, 
at approximately 1 hour after the start of infusion for all doses. Elimination of CD101 
appears multiphasic. AUC and C max increased in a dose proportional manner and total 
body clearance was similar throughout the dose levels with t 1/2 values of >80 hours 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 36 of 128 
 through the first week of plasma collection (a longer terminal t 1/2 of 127- 146 hours is 
calculated when incorporating data from later collection times). Total body clearance was 
approximately 4 mL/min across the CD101 doses, indicating linear kinetics for CD101 
across the doses investigated. Volume of distribution (V z and V ss) ranged from 33 to 
48 L. The fraction of dose excreted in urine was <1% at all dose levels, indicating minor 
contribution of renal clearance in CD101 excretion.

4.5.2 Multiple Ascending Dose Pharmacokinetics (CD101.IV.1.02)  
Pharmacokinetics was determined by analyzing plasma and urine samples for 
concentration of CD101 obtained from subjects who received CD101 Injection in each 
cohort at various time points after administration of study drug.  
The plasma PK of CD101 was also w ell characterized following 2 or 3 weekly doses of 
CD101: 100 mg (Day 1/ Day 8), 200 mg (Day 1/ Day 8), and 400 mg (Day 1/ Day 8/ Day 
15). Exposures following the first dose were very comparable to that observed in the 
SAD study, with AUC and C max generall y increasing in a dose proportional manner 
(Table 4). Accumulation was minor, ranging from 14% to 34% (or 1.14 to 1.34) as 
measured by C max ratio of last/first dose an d 30% to 55% (or 1.30 to 1.55), as measured 
by the area under the curve from time 0 to 168 hours (AUC 0-168) ratio of last/first dose.

4.6 SUMMARY OF KNOWN BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL RISKS  
4.6.1 Potential Benefits  
It is anticipated that subjects participating in this study who are randomized to the CD101 
IV groups will experience at least similar therapeutic benefits as subjects randomized to 
the caspofungin group. Approximately two -thirds of the subjects enrolled in this study 
will be randomized to receive CD101 IV.  
The therapeutic benefits of caspofungin and fluconazole for the treatment of fungal 
infections are documented in the prescribing information and published literature. 
Approximately one -third of the subjects enrolled in this study will be randomized to 
recei ve IV caspofungin with the option of oral fluconazole step down therapy.  
4.6.2  Known Risks  
Safety and PK data from Study CD101.IV.1.01 and Study CD101.IV.1.02 are presented 
in Section 4.4.  
Nonclinical toxicology of CD101 is presented in Section 4.3 and described in the 
Investigator Brochure.

 4.6.3 Potential Risks  
Echinocandins are typically well tolerated ( Eraxis [anidulafungin] Prescribing 
Information, 2013; Mycamine [micafungin sodium] Prescribing Information , 2013; 
Cancidas [caspofungin acetat e] Prescribing Information, 2014). Potential drug class 
effects include risk of abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis, and hepatic failure. General 
and administration site events (infusion related reactions, peripheral edema, rig ors, 
infusion site inflammation, and pyrexia) have been reported for echinocandins ( Eraxis 
[anidulafungin] Prescribing Information, 2013; Mycamine [micafungin sodium] 
Prescribing Information, 2013; Cancidas [caspofungin acetate] Prescribing Information, 
2014) . Possible histamine -mediated symptoms have been reported in patients who 
received rapid infusions of echinocandins, including rash, urticaria, flushing, pruri tus, 
dyspnea, hypotension, facial swelling, and vasodilation. Anaphylactic -like reactions have 
been reported with micafungin ( Mycamine [micafungin sodium] Prescribing Information 
2013).  
Results from a phototoxicity study in rats indicate evidence of phototoxicity at elevated 
CD101 exposures ( Section 4.3). Because of the safety  margin  to the human- equivalent 
exposure of subjects in this study , the possibility of the rat- specific histamine release 
affecting the results, and the mild reaction s een in rats at 3.6 -fold above the human 
equivalent plasma level, Cidara believes that the risk to humans is low. Nevertheless, 
pending resolution of this issue through a Phase 1 human clinical study, Cidara has 
notified investigators of the findings and added wording to the Informed C onsent Form 
(ICF) for subjects to use measures to reduce su n exposure while on study drug.  
Based on a fertility study in male rats, there is the potential risk for decreased sperm 
motility, increased incidences of abnormal sper m morphology , and testicular 
seminiferous tubular epithelial degeneration. These findings were noted at 2.5-fold the 
exposure for Group 2. The risk to humans is unknown, thus the male contraception 
requirements in inclusion criterion 4 have been extended f rom first dose to 90 days with 
the inclusion of prohibited sperm donation within the period. This ri sk will be included in 
the ICF.  
In a 3-month study in monkeys, there were observations of tremors, intention tremors, 
and histology consistent with axonal d egeneration (potentially consistent with clinical 
presentation of neuropathy ) first appearing at week 6 of dosing . These observations 
occurred  at 11 -fold the exposure for Group 2. Given the late timing and high exposure 
relative to the Group 2 dosing regimen , the risk to study subjects is assessed as low.  
Because there may be unknown and potential risks with administration of CD101 IV, all 
subjects will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability by repeated assessment of 
clinical, vital s igns, and clinical laboratory safety parameters and reporting of AEs.  
4.6.4 Risk -Benefit Summary  
Overall, based on risk/benefit analysis, the current study appears to be fully justified in 
the planned population.

 4.7 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SING REGIMEN  
A population PK model has been developed for rezafungin (Bader 2018). Data from a 
subset of Phase 2 Part A data as well as data from a Phase 1 study was added to  update 
the structural model and evaluate covariate effects. Preliminary data from the modeling  is 
used to set doses for upcoming Phase 3 studies.  
In brief, these data were best described using a 4 -compartment model with 0 -order drug 
input via the IV infusion and first -order, linear elimination. This model fit the observed 
data with very little bias  and excellent precision.  
Monte Carlo simulations for 2000 hypothetical patients were conducted to assess the 
probability of PK/PD target attainment using t he weekly free- drug area under the 
rezafungin concentration -time curve from time 0  to 168 hours ( fAUC 0-168) after each dose 
for the two dosing regimens tested in Part A ; albumin, weight, and sex were bootstrapped 
(using random sampling and replacement) from the dataset of subjects and plasma protein 
binding of 97.4% was used. 
Nonclinical studies of C. al bicans  infection  model s in mice have shown that a rezafungin  
free-drug f AUC:MIC is the PK/PD parame ter most predictive of efficacy , and f AUC 0-
168:MIC targets have been established in the mouse model for important pathogenic 
Candida spp. ( refer to Investigator Brochure).  
The PK/PD target attainment for the 2 regimens used in Part A (400 mg once weekly for 
2 to 4 weeks and a 400 mg loading dose on Week 1 followed by 200 mg once weekly for 
a total of 2  to 4 weeks) relative to the reported MIC distribu tion ( Pfaller 2017) is shown 
in Table 5  and Figure 4  for C.  albicans  and in Table 6  and Figure 5  for C.  glabrata. Both 
regimens provided adequate PK/PD target attainment throughout 4 wee ks of dosing, up 
to a MIC of 0.5 µg/mL for C. albicans , and up to an MIC of 16 µg/mL for C. glabrata. 
The 400 mg once weekly dosing regimen seems to provide some additional benefit in 
terms of target attainment, improving by 40  to 70% for an MIC=1 , but not  until Week  2 
or beyond. However, most of the benefits of antifungal treatment occur in the first week 
of therapy, and the incremental improvement for the 400 mg once weekly dose regimen 
for Weeks  2 and 3 will likely be of little real clinical benefit in the treatment of 
candidemia or invasive candidiasis. In fact, in comparison to other echinocandins, the 
400 mg loading dose on Week 1, followed by 200  mg once weekly dose regimen 
provides a significant advantage in terms of potential to cover pathogens with higher 
MICs ( Table 7).  
The data from Part A indicate that both rezafungin regimens were comparable to each 
other and to caspofungin  for efficacy and safety. There wer e no adverse events that 
seemed to cluster in the 400 mg once weekly group to indicate any concern for increased 
toxicity with the higher dose. However, the Phase 1 results do indicate that there are 
infusion reactions that can occur in the higher dose rez afungin regimen that are an

 echinocandin class effect and are related to the rate of infusion (mg/min). Thus, given 
there is no apparent clinical benefit to the 400 mg once weekly dose regimen over the 
regimen with a 400 mg loading dose on Week 1, followed by 200 mg once weekly, and 
that both options provide at least a three dilution MIC improvement in target attainment 
over the best of the currently approved echinocandins ( Table 7 ), the regimen of a 400 mg  
loading dose on Week 1, followed by 200 mg once weekly  for a total of 2  to 4 doses can  
be selected for safety and efficacy in the treatment of candidemia and/or invasive 
candidiasis .

 4.8 POPULATION TO BE STU DIED 
In this study, adult subjects with candidemia and/or IC will be included.  
4.9 STATEMENT OF COMPLIA NCE  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable regulatory and 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) requirements.  
4.10 JUSTIFICATION FOR US E OF CD101 IN CANDIDEMIA A ND 
INVASIVE CANDIDIASIS  
Candidemia is a fungal bloodstream infection usually affecting patients who are already 
ill with other comorbidities. Invasive candidiasis defines a number of different organ-
specific infections with Candida spp. Candidemia and IC m ay present without the other 
syndrome or may exist together as part of the same pathophysiology of disseminated 
candidiasis. Risk factors for candidemia and IC include recent surgery, organ and bone 
marrow transplants, broad- spectrum antibiotic use, receip t of total parenteral nutrition, 
end stage renal disease, indwelling vascular catheters or other devices , etc. While 
candidemia is often associated with other forms of IC, including intra -abdominal abscess, 
peritonitis, or pleuritic involvement, candidemia  without other overt organ involvement is 
the most common form of IC diagnosed. A recent study by the ESCMID Fungal Infection 
Study Group reported the incidence of candidemia as 6.9 per 1000 intensive care unit 
patients with mortality rates between 20% and  49% (Kett et al., 2011; Gudlaugsson et al., 
2003; Arendrup et al., 2011). Candidemia and IC are serious and potentially life -
threatening infectious complication s that require aggressive and timely antifungal 
management.  
The current IDSA and ESCMID guidelines recommend echinocandins as first -line 
therapy for candidemia and most forms of IC ( Pappas et al., 2016; Cornely et al., 2012). 
There are currently 3 commercially authorized echinocandins in the U S and the European 
Union: caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. These echinocandins are 
administered once daily via IV infusion and share similar PK pa rameters and safety 
profiles. CD101 is a novel echinocandin derived from another echinocandin 
(anidulafungin). CD101 has a more stable molecular structure compared to the other 
echinocandins, which results in a reduction in the formation of toxic metabolit es and an 
improvement in the duration of exposure to active drug. This stability further translates 
into a better safety profile as demonstrated in both nonclinical and clinical studies, as 
well as a unique PK profile that allows for high dose, front -loaded exposures for 
improved fungal killing and once weekly IV dosing.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 46 of 128 
 Both in vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated the potency and efficacy of CD101 
against Candida and disseminated candidiasis ( Section 4.2, Section 4.3, and Investigator 
Brochure ). In all nonclinical efficacy studies performed for CD101 in neutropenic 
disseminated candidiasis, CD101 has performed as well as, or better than, currently 
approved echinocandin comparators. This Phase 2 double -blind, randomized, controlled 
trial comparing 2 dose regimens of CD101 against caspofungin is the first efficacy study 
in humans for CD101. The duration of antifungal therapy in standard practice depends on 
the time it takes to clear the Candida from infected blood or tissues, and thus patients 
with IC often require a longer duration of therapy than patients with candidemia alone. 
To that end, all subjects in this study must be administered study drug for at least 14 days 
followed by an optional third week (for subjects with either candidemia or IC)  or fourth 
week (for subjects with IC only) of treatment if clinically indicated.  
In PK and PD models, both of the CD101 dosing regimens proposed for the Phase 2 
study demonstrate 100% target attainment of wild -type C. albicans  and C. glabrata ( C. 
albicans  data is presented in Section 4.7). The 400- mg, once -weekly dosing regimen may 
have improved coverage of isolates with MICs >0.5 µg/mL, which is now of increasing 
prevalence in some institutions. Therefore, in this nonpowered study, both CD101 groups 
are expected to have equal efficacy with each other, as well as with the comparator. Since 
mild infusion reactions were observed in the Phase 1 studies, occurring most frequently 
in the third dose of the 400- mg dose group, it is possible that the lower dose regimen of 
CD101 may be better tolerated than the higher dose. This Phase 2 study is intended to 
assess, but not directly compare, the efficacy of both CD101 and the approved first -line 
comparator in the same patient population and to build confidence in the efficacy of 
CD101 for a larger powered Phase 3 study. Results from this study should help to discern 
any differences in safety and tolerability between the 2 CD101  dose groups and help to 
select the best CD101 dose and regimen for the Phase 3 study.  
4.11 JUSTIFICATION OF THE  PART B STUDY  
The addition of Part B in Amendment 5 of the protocol  increased the study sample size 
by approximately 50 % to 130% (depending on the r ate of enrollment over the additional 
months to the staged start of the Phase 3 study , and the rolling close -out of Part B) with 
an interim analysis performed after approximately 40 to 60 subjects in the  
Microbiological Intent -to-Treat  (mITT ) population were enrolled and completed study 
drug therapy . The timing of this interim analysis enable d a smooth transition from the 
end of enrollment for Part A to the initiation of enrollment in Part B, and helped  protect 
Part B subjects from unknown risks of low ef ficacy or safety findings prior to the start of 
the study extension.  
As detailed in Section 4.10, efficacy is expected to be equal between the 2 regimens in 
this study.  There may be some advantages for the Group 1 subjects due to higher 
exposures, especially for Candida strains with higher MICs, but due to the low 
prevalence of these organisms , the effect of the higher exposure of Group 1 on the ove rall 
efficacy estimates is expected to be minimal.   
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 47 of 128 
 The purpose of Part B is to further assess the safety and efficacy of CD101.  Assessment 
of blinded safety data and data unblinded for safety purposes in Part A  indicate d that 
there were no known episodes of flushing, infusion reactions , or any evidence of target 
organ toxicity  in Part A , and thus the focus of continued CD101 assessment in Part B was 
Group 1. Part B was initiate d directly after the close of enrollment for Part  A and 
continued during the analysis of Part A data. Following evaluation of the unblinded 
results from Part  A, it was determined that the best CD101 dose regimen for Phase 3 was 
the 400 mg  loading dose on Week 1 followed by 200 mg once weekly for a total of 
2 to 4 weeks  (Group  2). Thus, with this amendment, enrollment in Group 1 will stop and 
Part B will continue enrollment of rezafungin for injection Group 2 and caspofungin 
enrolled in a 2:1 ratio. This extension is expected to at least double the size of the 
rezafungin for in jection  safety database.  
5.0 STUDY PURPOSE AND OB JECTIVES

 6.0 STUDY DESIGN 
6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double -blind study of CD101 IV 
or IV caspofungin followed by oral  fluconazole step -down therapy for treatment of 
subjects with candidemia and/or IC. In Part A, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 
ratio to receive CD101 IV treatment Group 1; CD101 IV treatment Group 2, or IV 
caspofungin ( Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Table 6 ). Oral step -down therapy is allowed in 
all 3 treatment groups in Part A; oral placebo in the CD101 IV groups and oral 
fluconazole in the caspofungin group. After approximately 90 subjects hav e been 
enrolled in the mITT population in  Part A, enrollment into Part A of the study will close 
and Part B will begin. In Part B, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
CD101 IV treatment Group 1 or IV caspofungin ( Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Table 6) 
until ≥45 additional subjects and no more than 120 subjects have been enrolled. ( Note:  
Subjects enrolled under Amendment 5 and assigned to CD101 IV receive Group 1 
treatment and subjects enr olled under Amendment 6 and assigned to CD101 IV treatment 
receive Group  2 treatment. Subjects enroll under the current, approved amendment at the 
site at the time of randomization; subjects enrolled to Amendment 5 continue study 
participation according to  the same amendment regardless of subsequent approval of 
Amendment  6.) Total enrollment will depend on the enrollment rate for the 6-  to 8- month 
period between the end of Part A and the staged start of the Phase 3 study , which is the 
trigger for the rollin g close -out of Part B . Oral step -down therapy is allowed in both 
treatment groups in Part B; oral placebo in the CD101 IV group and oral fluconazole in 
the caspofungin group.

 Subjects with candidemia only may be treated with study drug for a maximum of 
21 days. Subjects with IC (with or without candidemia) may be treated with study drug 
for a maximum of 28 days. Subjects will be presumed to have IC if there is a positive 
cultu re for Candida spp. from a normally sterile site other than blood or if there is a 
positive sponsor -approved rapid in vitro diagnostic (IVD) or blood culture for Candida 
spp. combined with radiographic evidence of IC.  
Subjects in the CD101 IV treatment Gro up 1 will receive CD101 IV 400 mg on Day  1 
and Day 8, with an optional dose of 400 mg on Day 15 (for all subjects) and an optional 
dose of 400 mg on Day 22 (only for subjects with IC), if needed.S ubjects in the CD101 
IV treatment Group 2 will receive CD101  IV 400 mg on Day 1 and 200 mg on Day 8, 
with an optional dose of 200 mg on Day 15 (for all subjects) and an optional dose of 
200 mg on Day 22 (only for subjects with IC), if needed. S ubjects in the caspofungin 
group will receive IV caspofungin (a single 70 mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by 
50 mg once daily) for ≥3 days up to a maximum of 21 days for subjects with candidemia 
only and up to a maximum of 28 days for subjects with IC (with or without candidemia). 
The optional doses of CD101 IV on Day 15 and Day 22 may be administered according 
to the subject’s clinical response and the medical judgment of the Principal Investigator 
(PI).  
After ≥3 days of IV therapy, subjects in the caspofungin group can be switched to oral 
step-down therapy of fluconazole (a loading dose of 800 mg [4 capsules] on the first day 
followed by 400 mg [2 capsules]/day thereafter) if criteria are met. In order to maintain 
the blind, subjects in the CD101 IV groups who have switched to oral step- down therapy 
will receive oral placebo (4 capsules on the first day followed by 2 capsules/day 
thereafter) and subjects in the caspofungin treatment group will receive IV placebo on 
Day 8, and on Days 15 and 22 if study drug is administered through these timepoints. The 
total IV plus oral treatment duration will be ≥14 days and up to a maximum of 28 days.  
The dose and duration of any prior antifungal treatment taken within 4 weeks of 
randomization will be recorded at Screening. A retinal examination for evidence of a 
Candida eye infection, including endophthalmitis or chorioretinitis,  will be performed 
during Screening or by Day 7 only on subjects with candidemia  by blood culture,  and 
should be repeated in subjects who were negative at baseline if the subject develops 
visual signs or symptoms of a Candida eye infection during the course of the study. 
Subjects who were negative at baseline and diagnosed with a  Candida eye infe ction after 
initiating study drug should have an urgent ophthalmologic consultation (if not already 
done), should stop study drug, and be initiated on appropriate therapy for Candida eye 
infection per the local guidelines ( Pappas et al., 2016; Cornely et al., 2012). If possible, 
all subjects diagnosed with endophthalmitis or chorioretinitis should remain in the study 
and all subsequent antifungal drugs, interventions, and outcomes for endophthalmi tis or 
chorioretinitis should be recorded.

 The Schedule of Assessments and Procedures is presented i n Table 2. Study Day 1 is 
defined as the first day of study drug administration. Subsequent study days are defined 
by the number of consecutive calendar days thereafter. All subjects will be monitored for 
AEs and SAEs following signing of the ICF at Screening and throughout the study until 
the FU visit (Days 45 -52 for subjects with candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects 
with IC, with or without candidemia) for each treatment group. Vital signs (temp erature, 
heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) will be recorded daily while receiving IV 
study drug and at Day 14 (±1 day), Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC), End -of-
Treatment (EOT) (+2 days allowed after last dose of study drug), and FU (Days 45 -52 for 
subjects with candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without 
candidemia). Hematology and chemistry laboratory tests will be performed at Screening; 
Days 2 and 4; Day 8, Day 14 (±1 day), EOT (+2 days allowed after last dose of study 
drug) and at the FU visit. Coagulation laboratory tests (prothrombin time/international 
normalized ratio [PT/INR] and either partial thromboplastin time [PTT] or activated 
partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]) will be performed at Screening. ECG s will be 
performed at Screening (before subject randomization) and EOT (+2 days allowed after 
the last dose of study drug).  
Mycological diagnosis of candidemia or IC sufficient for inclusion in the study will be 
established by a positive microbiological test for yeast o r Candida within 96 hours from 
time of collection of the sample until randomization. Acceptable positive microbiological 
tests for yeast o r Candida include ≥1 blood culture positive for yeast or Candida, a 
Sponsor -approved rapid IVD test pos itive for Candida spp, or a positive Gram stain for 
yeast or positive culture for Candida spp. from a specimen obtained from a normally 
sterile site. If the positive blood culture used to qualify the subject for the study is drawn 
>12 hours from randomizat ion, then an additional set of blood cultures must be obtained 
≤12 hours before randomization. Blood cultures should be performed daily (preferred) or 
every other day until 2 blood cultures drawn ≥12 hours apart are negative, without an 
intervening positive culture. Generally, blood cultures should involve 2 separate draws 
with ≥1 draw from a peripheral vein without an IV catheter. Two bottles should be filled 
from each draw site, totaling 4 bottles for each set of blood cultures. If possible, use 3 
aerobic and 1 anaerobic bottle (if available at the site) for each blood culture set, although 
2 aerobic and 2 anaerobic (if  available) is also acceptable.  
In Part A only, blood samples will be collected for PK analysis from the OPPOSITE arm 
of the infusion on Da y 1 (within 10 minutes before the end of infusion, between 15 
minutes and 1 hour after the end of infusion, and between 2 hours and 12 hours after the 
end of infusion), Day 2 (random draw, with safety labs if possible), Day 4 (random draw, 
with safety labs  if possible), Day 8 (predose only), and Day 15 (predose only). If therapy 
is stopped on or before Day 14 and there is no Day 15 dose, then the Day 15 PK sample 
should be drawn with the safety laboratory samples for the Day 14 visit. For the purpose 
of mai ntaining the blind, blood samples will be collected from all subjects, when 
possible, in all 3 treatment groups in Part A, but only PK samples from the CD101 IV

 groups will be analyzed (using a validated assay) by an independent, central bioanalytical 
laboratory. In Part B, PK samples will not be collected.  
Overall success and mycological eradication will be assessed at Day 5, Day 14, Day 28 
(±2 days; only for subjects with IC), and FU (Days 45- 52 for subjects with candidemia 
only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without candidemia). Clinical response 
will be assessed at Day 14 (±1 day), Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC), and FU 
(Days 45 -52 for subjects w ith candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with 
or without candidemia).

 6.2 NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  
In Part A, subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) until there are approximately 30 subjects in 
the CD 101 IV treatment Group 1, 30 subjects in the CD101 IV treatment Group 2, and 30 
subjects in the comparator group in the mITT population. It is expected that 
approximately 114 subjects will need to be randomized to achieve 90 subjects in the 
mITT population (assuming 80% of randomized subjects will be included in mITT 
population).  
In Part B, subjects will be randomized (2:1) until there are ≥30 subjects in the CD101 IV 
treatment and ≥15 subjects in the comparator group (≥45 additional subjects and no more 
than 120 subjects). ( Note: Subjects enrolled under Amendment 5 and assigned to CD101 
IV receive Group 1 treatment and subjects enrolled under Amendment 6 and assigned to 
CD101 IV treatment receive Group 2 treatment. Subjects enroll under the current, 
approved amendment at the site at the time of randomization; subjects enrolled to 
Amendment 5 continue study participation on the same amendment regardless of 
subsequent approval of Amendment 6.)  Total enrollment will depend on the enrollment 
rate for the 6 - to 8- month period between the end of Part A and the staged start of the 
Phase 3 study , which is the trigger for the rolling close -out of Part B .  
6.3 MEASURES TAKEN TO MI NIMIZE BIAS  
Bias is minimized by subject randomization and blinding in both Part A and Part B 
(Section 6.5).   
For the interim analysis, a few (≤5) efficacy and safety tables will be provided by an 
independent unblinded statistician without individual subject data to allow for 
continuation to Part B of the study. Afte r the database for Part A is locked , summary 
tables of unblinded efficacy and safety data will be provided. Individual subjects will not 
be unblinded for either the interim analysis or the Part A analysis . (Note: An addendum 
to the Unblinding Plan for Part  A allowed for unblinded safety review of adverse events 
of interest identified during blinded safety review; the addendum allowed for no more 
than 5% of subjects to be unblinded.)  The data from Part B will only be unblinded and 
analyzed after database lock for Part B at completion of the study.  
6.4 EXPECTED DURATION OF  SUBJECT PARTICIPATI ON 
Study participation will require from 45 to 52 days for subjects with candidemia only (or 
from 52 -59 days for subjects with IC, with or without candidemia) after the first dose of 
study drug: study drug administration from Day 1 up to Day 21 (for subjects with 
candidemia) or up to Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC); safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy assessments up to Day 21 (for subjects with candidemia) or up to D ay 28 (±2 
days; only for subjects with IC); and a FU visit (Days 45 to 52 for subjects with 
candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without candidemia).

Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 56 of 128 
 6.5 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING  
After informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be screened for study eligibility 
before randomization. Subjects in Part A will be assigned a subject number and 
randomized (1:1:1) to receive CD101 IV treatment Group 1, CD101 IV treatment Group 
2, or caspofungin on Day 1 just prior to dosing. Subjects in Part B will be assigned a 
subject number and randomized (2:1) to receive CD101 IV treatment or caspofungin on 
Day 1 just prior to dosing. Randomization will be stratified based on the method used at 
Screening to establish the diagnosis ( blood culture/rapid IVD and positive Gram 
stain/culture from a specimen obtained from a normally sterile site). If a subject has both 
a positive blood culture/rapid IVD and Gram stain/culture from a specimen obtained from 
a normally sterile site, the subje ct will be randomized within the positive Gram 
stain/culture from a specimen obtained from a normally sterile site stratum. The study 
site’s pharmacist (or pharmacist designee) will obtain the study drug assignment from a 
computer -generated randomization s chedule. A subject is considered randomized when 
the randomization transaction is recorded in the Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS).  
The data for the 40 to 60 subjects in the mITT population involved in the interim analysis 
will be locked  prior to the  unblinded interim analysis, and the database for Part A will be 
locked prior to the Part A analysis. The data from Part A will be unblinded after the 
database is locked for Part A , but likely prior to completion of Part B , and interim 
summary results and full Part A summary results will be reported when available.  
All study personnel, including the Sponsor, PI, and site personnel involved in study 
conduct, and subjects will remain blinded to by -subject study medication assignment for 
both Part A and Part B  until the st udy is completed , with the exception of the pharmacy 
monitor, unblinded program manager, clinical supplies, document manager, and quality 
(per the Sponsor Blinding Plan). Additionally , in Part A only , some personnel from 
vendors, including the PK analyst and an independent unblinded statistician, will be 
unblinded, but will not be involved in study conduct or the final analysis . An independent 
unblinded statistician will perform the analysis on the inte rim and final unblinded Part A 
data.  (Note: An addendum to the Unblinding Plan for Part A allowed for unblinded safety 
review of adverse events of interest identified during blinded safety review; the 
addendum allowed for no more than 5% of subjects to be unblinded.)  The Pharmacy 
Monitor will monitor drug preparation and drug accountability during the study and cases 
in which unblinding is required due to a safety or tolerability issue. To maintain study 
blinding, study drug preparation will be performed by  an unblinded site pharmacist (or 
qualified unblinded personnel at the study site not involved with study procedures or 
evaluations).  
Instructions for study drug preparation and dosing are outlined in the Pharmacy Manual 
provided separately to the site. To maintain the blind, oral study drug pills must never be 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 57 of 128 
 crushed. In the case of a medical emergency requiring the PI to know the identity of the 
study drug, the PI will follow the procedures outlined in Section 8.6.  
7.0 SELECTION, DISCONTINUATION, AND WITHDRAW AL OF 
SUBJECTS  
To be enrolled in this study, all subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria 
and none of the exclusion criteria.  
7.1 SUBJECT INCLUSION CRITERIA  
Subjects in must meet ALL of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled: 
1. Males or females ≥18 years.  
2. Established mycological diagnosis of candidemia and/or IC from a sample taken 
≤96 hours before randomization defined as:  
a.  ≥1 blood culture positive for yeast or Candida  
OR 
b. Positive test for Candida from a Sponsor -approved rapid IVD  
OR 
c. Positive Gram stain for yeast or positive culture for Candida spp. from a 
specimen obtained from a normally sterile site  
3. Willing to initiate  or continue medical treatment to cure infections, including receipt 
of antibiotics and surgical procedures, if required. Subjects receiving only 
medications and measures for comfort, and not cure, should not be enrolled.  
4. Female subjects of child -bearing p otential <2 years postmenopausal must agree to 
and comply with using 1 barrier method (eg, female condom with spermicide) plus 1 
other highly effective method of birth control (eg, oral contraceptive, implant, 
injectable, indwelling intrauterine device, va sectomized partner), or sexual abstinence 
while participating in this study. Male subjects  must be vasectomized, abstain from 
sexual intercourse, or agree to use barrier contraception (condom with spermicide), 
and also agree not to donate sperm from first dose of CD101 (Day 1) until 90 days 
following last administration of study drug . 
5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent. If the subject is unable to 
consent for himself/herself, a legally acceptable representative must provide informed 
consen t on their behalf.  
6. Presence of 1 or more systemic signs attributable to candidemia and/or IC (eg, fever, 
hypothermia, hypotension, tachycardia. tachypnea) ( Section 7.1.2)  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 58 of 128 
 7.1.1 Rapid In Vitro Diagnostics for Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis  
The addition of rapid IVD for the identification of subjects with candidemia and/or IC is 
being employed to reduce the amount of prior empiric antifungal therapy being 
administered to potential study subjects. Rapid IVDs for Candida spp. used for inclusion 
in this study must be approved by the Sponsor prior to use in the study. Subjects may be 
enrolled based on a positive result at Screening from a Sponsor -approved rapid IVD, but 
a culture from blood or normally sterile tissue or fluid that is positive for Candida spp. 
will still be the required objective measure for candidemia or IC in the study analyses for 
efficacy. Subjects who are enrolled based on a positive rapid IVD test  and have negative 
or missing blood culture at Screening  and remain culture negat ive, may or may not have 
study therapy discontinued, but should continue to be followed in the study for safety 
assessments.  
Potential subjects with 1 or more risk factors for candidemia and IC should have a 
Sponsor -approved rapid IVD for Candida spp. perf ormed only if the site is drawing a 
blood sample for blood culture and if empiric antifungal therapy for candidiasis has been 
administered or will be administered within the subsequent day. Risk factors for 
candidemia and IC include (but are not limited to ): 
• Immunosuppression without frank neutropenia  
• Central venous catheter  
• Recent abdominal surgery 
• Pancreatitis  
• End stage renal disease  
• Current daily administration of total parenteral nutrition  
• Systemic inflammatory response syndrome while on broad spectrum antibiotics  
Sites may choose to perform a sponsor -approved rapid IVD in potential subjects without 
the listed risk factors for candidemia and IC, but the potential subject still must have a 
blood culture drawn and empiric antifungal therapy administered. A  call to the Medical 
Monitor is recommended for any questions about risk factors for candidemia and the 
appropriate subjects on which to perform a rapid IVD for Candida spp.  
7.1.2 Systemic Signs of Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis  
It is a requirement that at least 1 systemic sign attributable to candidemia and/or IC be 
present at Screening for the subject to be eligible for enrollment. The Screening period 
for assessing systemic signs for inclusion in the study may include the 4 hours prior to the 
drawing of t he qualifying positive blood culture  (when systemic signs of infection 
resulted in obtaining blood cultures ), qualifying positive culture from a sterile site , or 
qualifying rapid IVD , through enrollment. The possible signs of infection that might be 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 59 of 128 
 attrib utable to candidemia and/or IC at baseline include fever, hypothermia, hypotension, 
tachycardia, and tachypnea.  
 
For the listed systemic signs of candidemia, the qualifying parameters are listed below: 
 
Fever:  Oral temperature ≥38°C [100.4°F] or a tympanic , temporal, rectal, or core body 
temperature ≥38.3°C [101°F])  
 
Hypothermia:  Tympanic, temporal, rectal, or core body temperature ≤35°C [95.2°F]  
 
Hypotension:  Systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure <70 mm Hg 
with a normovolemic or hypervolemic status  
 
Tachycardia:  Heart rate >100 beats per minute with a normovolemic or hypervolemic 
status  
 
Tachypnea:  Respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute  
7.2 SUBJECT EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
Subjects must NOT meet any of the following exclusion criteria to be enrolled:  
1. Any of the following forms of IC:  
a. Septic arthritis in a prosthetic joint (septic arthritis in a native joint is allowed)  
b. Osteomyelitis  
c. Endocarditis or myocarditis  
d. Meningitis, endophthalmitis, or any central nervous system infection 
2. Neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil count ≤500/µL) at Screening or anticipated 
neutropenia during the study  
3. Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels >10 -fold the upper 
limit of normal 
4. Severe hepatic impairment in subjects with a history of chronic cir rhosis (Child- Pugh 
score >9)  
5. Received systemic treatment with an antifungal agent at approved doses for treatment 
of candidemia or IC for >48 hours (for example, >2 doses of a once daily antifungal 
agent or >4 doses of a twice daily antifungal agent) in the last 96 hours before 
randomization 
a. Exception: Receipt of antifungal therapy to which any Candida spp. isolated at 
Screening in qualifying culture s is not susceptible ( Appendix 1)  
6. Pregnant females  
7. Lactating females who are nursing  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 60 of 128 
 8. Known hypersensitivity to CD101 IV, caspofungin, any echinocandin, or to any of 
their excipients  
9. Previous participation in this or any previous CD101 study  
10. Recent use of an investigational medicinal product within 28 day s of the first dose of 
study drug or presence of an investigational device at the time of Screening  
11. The PI considers that the subject should not participate in the study  
12. Presence of an indwelling vascular catheter or device that cannot be removed and is 
likely to be the source of candidemia  
7.3 REQUALIFICATION FOR ENTRY  
Subjects not fulfilling the entry criteria and not randomized may be rescreened for 
participation if their eligibility characteristics have changed.  
7.4 SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA 
7.4.1 Withdrawal from  Study Protocol  
Subjects on study drug who wish to withdraw completely from this clinical study should 
be encouraged to complete the assessments at EOT. However, subjects may withdraw 
consent to participate in this study at any time without penalty or loss  of benefits to which 
the subject is otherwise entitled. Every reasonable effort should be made to determine the 
reason a subject withdraws prematurely and this information should be recorded on the 
appropriate page(s) of the electronic case report form (eCRF). Subjects may be 
withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Subject unable or unwilling to continue  
• Subject elects to withdraw informed consent  
• AE (whether or not related to study drug) that precludes further participation in the 
study  in the judgment of the PI and/or Sponsor  
• Protocol non- compliance  
• Subject lost to follow up  
• The PI considers that it is in the subject’s best interest not to continue participation in 
the study  
Subjects withdrawn from the study need not participate in the FU visit.  
Following enrollment, subjects diagnosed with IC involving 1 or more organ systems and 
normally excluded from study participation (Exclusion Criterion #1, Section 7.2) do not 
need to exit the study. Documentation of the disease should be placed in the eCRF along 
with any further interventions related to the disease.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 61 of 128 
 7.4.2 Early Discontinuation from Study Drug Administration  
For subjects who prema turely discontinue study drug (ie, before the anticipated full 
course of study drug therapy required for effective treatment of candidemia and/or IC), 
EOT assessments should be performed on the day of discontinuation. The reason for 
premature discontinuati on of study drug administration should be recorded on the 
appropriate page(s) of the eCRF. Reasons for withdrawal from study drug may include, 
but are not limited to: 
• Cultures negative for Candida spp. 
o Blood culture is positive for yeast at enrollment, but  the final local blood culture 
results conclude the yeast is not Candida spp.  
o Subject is enrolled based on a rapid IVD test positive for Candida spp., but final 
local blood culture results from Screening or tissue/fluid culture results from a 
normally ster ile site are negative for Candida spp.  
• Safety  
o Subject unable or unwilling to continue or informed consent withdrawn  
○ Occurrence of an AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator, warrants the 
subject’s permanent discontinuation from study drug therapy. This includes 
development of a clinically significant laboratory abnormality that requires 
discontinuation from study drug (IV and IV/oral) therapy. In the event of 
discontinuation from study drug therapy due to the occurrence of an AE, the study 
site should notify the Medical Monitor as soon as possible  
○ Suspected or confirmed pregnancy or nursing during the study drug 
administration period.  
• Invasive Candidiasis  
Echinocandins are not appropriate therapy for Candida infections of the eye or central 
nervous system due to low drug distribution to these sites. In the event that a subject 
is diagnosed with endophthalmitis or chorioretinitis or a central nervous system 
infection with Candida species, study drug should be stopped and appropriate therapy 
should be started based on local guidelines ( Pappas et al., 2016; Cornely et al., 2012).  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 62 of 128 
 Study drug may be continued in the event of diagnosis of other forms of IC listed in 
the exclusion criteria if the involvement of other  organ systems was thought to be 
present at the time of enrollment and the diagnosis was delayed. If, on the other hand, 
the spread of Candida infection to other organ systems was thought to have occurred 
following enrollment and initiation of study drug, then the investigator should 
consider a change of therapy due to insufficient therapeutic effect of study drug. In all 
cases of other forms of IC, the investigator should consult local guidelines for the 
most appropriate management of disease and whether or not additional antifungal 
therapy may be warranted either during study drug administration or following 
completion of study drug therapy.  
• Insufficient therapeutic effect  
An insufficient therapeutic effect may be determined prior to the planned EOT visit. 
This determination will require an assessment of clinical status including the 
synthesis of symptoms and signs data (both local and systemic) and available 
laboratory data. Subjects who are deemed to have an insufficient therapeutic effect 
should be discontinued from study drug therapy.  
If a subject has daily blood cultures positive for Candida spp. through Day 7 despite 
appropriate study drug administration then this should be considered an insufficient 
therapeutic effect and study drug should be discont inued and salvage therapy 
initiated. The subject should remain in the study through the FU visit to complete 
safety assessments and assess for mortality.  
Seven days is the maximum number of daily positive blood cultures allowed prior to 
a change in antifu ngal therapy. The investigator may determine that there is an 
insufficient therapeutic response prior to Day 7.  
• Investigator discretion  
○ Resistant Pathogen(s): In the event that an organism resistant to ≥1 of the 
potential study drugs is  isolated , the Inves tigator will determine whether the 
subject remains on study drug therapy. The Investigator may decide to continue 
study drug therapy if, in the Investigator’s opinion, there is clear and continuing 
clinical improvement while on therapy.  
○ The Investigator m ay decide to prematurely discontinue study drug therapy and to 
initiate an alternative and appropriate therapy if, in the Investigator’s opinion, the 
subject is not benefiting from study drug.  
NOTE:  The Medical Monitor should be contacted to discuss whether to continue or 
prematurely discontinue a subject on the study drug in the event that the subject requires 
systemic concomitant antifungal therapy.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 63 of 128 
 In the event that salvage therapy is required due to either insufficient therapeutic effect or 
Investigat or discretion, the Investigator should note that since the subject has failed 
echinocandin therapy, other echinocandins may not be the best choice for salvage 
therapy. If the subject is switched to oral stepdown therapy prior to study drug failure, 
then the Investigator s hould consider that subjects in the caspofungin arm will also have 
been taking fluconazole. In both circumstances, the Investigator should refer to the IDSA 
(Pappas et al., 2016) or ESCMID (Ullmann et al., 2012; Cornely et al., 2012) guidel ines 
for treatment failure in candidemia, and will need to determine whether or not breaking 
the blind is necessary to make an informed choice of future antifungal therapies. 
7.5 REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
Randomized subjects who are withdrawn will not be replace d.  
7.6 STUDY TERMINATION BY SPONSOR AND TERMINATION 
CRITERIA 
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate an investigational site or this clinical study at 
any time. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• The incidence or s everity of AEs in this or other studies of CD101 IV indicate a 
potential health hazard to subjects  
• Serious or persistent noncompliance by the Investigator with the protocol, clinical 
research agreement, or applicable regulatory guidelines in conducting the  study  
• IRB/IEC decision to terminate or suspend approval for the investigation or the 
Investigator  
• Investigator request to withdraw from participation  
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory  
8.0 STUDY DRUGS  
In Part A, subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive CD101 IV treatment 
Group 1, CD101 IV treatment Group 2, or IV caspofungin. In Part B, subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive CD101 IV treatment Group 2 or IV caspofungin. 
(Note : Subjects enrolled under Amendment 5 and assigned to CD101 IV receive Group 1 
treatment and subjects enrolled under Amendment 6 and assigned to CD101 IV treatment 
receive Group  2 treatment. Subjects enroll under the current, approved amendment at the 
site at the time of randomization; subjects enrolled to Amendment 5 continue study 
participation on the same amendment regardless of subsequent approval of 
Amendment  6.) Oral step -down therapy is allowed in all treatment groups in Part A and 
Part B; oral placebo in the CD101 IV groups and oral fluconazole in the caspofungin 
group. The total IV plus oral treatment duration will be ≥14 days and up to a maximum of 
28 days ( Table 6 ). 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 64 of 128 
 In order to stop study drug for successful completion of therapy prior to 21 days, the 
following criteria must be met: 
• ≥14 days of study drug 
• The subject’s clinical status is considered stable based on Investigator assessment  
• All systemic signs attributable to candidemia and/or IC that were present at baseline 
have resolved  
• For subjects with IC, there is documented or presumed eradication of IC  
• If a blood culture is positive at Screening, 2 post -baseline blood cultures collected 
≥12 hours apart are negative for Candida spp. without an intervening positive culture , 
and t here are no subsequent blood cultures following the first qualifying negative 
culture that are positive for Candida spp. 
Once these criteria are met, the total duration of study drug is at the di scretion of the PI.  
Subjects randomized to the CD101 IV treatment Group 1 will receive 1 dose of CD101 
IV (400 mg) nominally over 60 (±10) minutes on Day 1 and Day 8 ( Table 6). Subjects in 
Group 1 who require >14 days of IV therapy will receive an optional third dose of CD101 
IV (400 mg) on Day 15. Subjects in Group 1 with IC (with or without candidemia) who 
requi re >21 days of IV therapy will receive an optional fourth dose of CD101 IV (400 
mg) on Day 22. Subjects in Group 1 will receive IV placebo on other study days in order 
to maintain the blind.  
Subjects randomized to the CD101 IV treatment Group 2 will receiv e 1 dose of CD101 
IV (400 mg) nominally over 60 (±10) minutes on Day 1 and 200 mg on Day 8 ( Table 6). 
Subjects in Group 2 who require >14 days of IV th erapy will receive an optional third 
dose of CD101 IV (200 mg) on Day 15. Subjects in Group 2 with IC (with or without 
candidemia) who require >21 days of IV therapy will receive an optional fourth dose of 
CD101 IV (200 mg) on Day 22. Subjects in Group 1 w ill receive IV placebo on other 
study days in order to maintain the blind. 
For both CD101 IV groups, the time may be increased as needed up to 180 (±10) minutes 
to manage symptoms of infusion reaction consistent with management of echinocandin 
class infusi on reactions, whereby decreasing the rate of infusion often alleviates 
symptoms. (Note: infusion must be completed within the 4 -hour stability limit, which 
starts at the time of reconstitution of rezafungin for injection lyophilized powder in the 
single -use vial.) 
Intravenous study drug is administered 24 (±2) hours after study drug was administered 
on the previous day.  
Subjects  may receive oral step -down therapy after ≥3 days of IV therapy. Step- down 
therapy in both CD101 IV treatment groups will be oral  placebo, in order to maintain the 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 65 of 128 
 blind. Subjects who have already switched to oral step- down therapy will receive both 
oral placebo and CD101 IV on Day 8 (±1 day), Day 15 (±1 day) for subjects who require 
>14 days of therapy, and Day 22 (±1 day) for subj ects with IC (with or without 
candidemia) who require >21 days of therapy.  
Subjects randomized to the caspofungin group will receive IV caspofungin (a single 70 
mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by 50 mg once daily over 60 (±10) minutes) for ≥3 
days and up to a maximum of 21 days for subjects with candidemia only and up to a 
maximum of 28 days for subjects with IC (with or without candidemia) ( Table 6).  
Intravenous study drug is administered 24 (±2) hours after study drug was administered 
on the previous day.  
Step-down therapy in the caspofungin treatment group will be oral fluconazole (a loading 
dose of 800 mg [4 capsules] the first day followed by 400 mg [2 capsules]/day 
thereafter). In order to maintain the blind, subjects who have already switched to oral 
step-down therapy will receive both oral fluconazole and IV placebo on Day 8 (±1 day), 
Day 15 (±1 day) for subjects who require >14 days of therapy, and Day 22 (±1 day) for 
subjects with IC (with or without candidemia) who require >21 days of therapy.  
The total IV plus oral treatment duration will be ≥14 days and up to 28 days.

Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 68 of 128 
 8.1.2 Drug Storage  
Vials of CD101 for Injection and diluted infusion bags s hould be stored and used per the 
directions presented in the Pharmacy Manual.  
8.2 CASPOFUNGIN  
Please refer to the prescribing information provided in the Pharmacy Manual for 
additional information. 
8.3 ORAL STEP -DOWN THERAPY  
An oral step -down therapy is allowed in all treatment groups provided the following 
criteria are met:  
• Able to take oral medication  
• ≥3 days of IV study drug 
• The Candida species isolated is susceptible to fluconazole   
• The subject’s clinical status is consid ered stable based on Investigator assessment  
• If a blood culture is positive at Screening, 2 post -baseline blood cultures drawn ≥12 
hours apart are negative for Candida spp., without an intervening positive culture, 
and the first of the 2 cultures was drawn ≥48 hours prior to oral study drug initiation  
• No evidence of moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency (alanine aminotransferase or 
aspartate aminotransferase >3× the upper limit of normal)  
• No history of hypersensitivity or any other contraindicat ions to t he use of fluconazole 
and in the Investigator’s opinion, the subject can tolerate oral fluconazole therapy  
(refer to current fluconazole Prescribing Information )  
The principal contraindications to fluconazole use are hepatic injury, anaphylaxis 
(hypersens itivity), drug -induced exfoliative skin disorders, and pregnancy. Medical staff 
should also beware of the potential of QT prolongation, especially when administered to 
subjects with known heart disease or with other drugs that cause this same side effect. 
Fluconazole should be administered with caution to subjects with potentially 
proarrhythmic conditions. The potential for drug- drug interactions with fluconazole is 
summarized in Section 8.7. 
It is the responsibility of the PI to carefully read the list of requirements for the switch to 
oral fluconazole listed above, as well as the list of contraindications, warning and 
precautions, and drug -drug interactions in the US Package Insert or Europea n Union 
Summary of Product Characteristics that are summarized here and in Section  8.3, in order 
to determine whether or not the subject may be elig ible and safely started on oral 
fluconazole stepdown therapy.  
For subjects with creatinine clearance >50 mL/min ( Appendix 2), oral step -down therapy 
will be fluconazole (a loading dose of 800 mg [4 capsules] on the first day followe d by 
400 mg [2 capsules]/day thereafter) in the caspofungin treatment group and oral placebo 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 69 of 128 
 (4 capsules on the first day followed by 2 capsules/day thereafter) in the CD101 treatment 
groups.  
To maintain the blind, oral study drug pills must never be crus hed. 
The total IV plus oral treatment duration will be ≥14 days and up to 28 days. 
8.4 DOSE ADJUSTMENT  
8.4.1 CD101 IV  
Dosage adjustments are not allowed in the CD101 IV groups.  
8.4.2 Caspofungin  
Subjects in the caspofungin group with moderate hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh score 
of 7-9 with a history of chronic cirrhosis ) will receive a loading dose of caspofungin of 
70 mg on Day 1 and 35 mg/day thereafter.  
Subjects in the caspofungin group weighing >80 kg or on concomitant rifampin, 
nevirapine, efavirenz, phenytoin, dexa methasone, or carbamazepine may receive 70 mg 
caspofungin daily. Dose adjustment based on potential drug -drug interactions may be 
considered at the Investigator’s discretion.  
8.4.3 Fluconazole  
Subjects in the caspofungin group with renal impairment who are switc hed to oral 
stepdown therapy may receive reduced doses of fluconazole.  
For subjects with creatinine clearance ≤50 mL/min ( Appendix 2), oral step -down therapy 
should be fluconazole (a loading dose of 400 mg [2 capsules] on the first  day followed by 
200 mg [1 capsule]/day thereafter) in the caspofungin treatment group and oral placebo 
(2 capsules on the first day followed by 1 capsule/day thereafter) in the CD101 treatment 
groups.  
For subjects receiving hemodialysis, oral step- down t herapy should be fluconazole (a full 
loading dose of 800 mg [4 capsules] followed by 400 mg [2 capsules] only after each 
episode of hemodialysis) in the caspofungin treatment group and oral placebo (4 capsules 
on the first day followed by 2 capsules after each hemodialysis) in the CD101 treatment 
groups.  
8.5 COMPLIANCE  
Treatment compliance for IV study drugs will be documented in the eCRF by recording 
the date, start time, stop time, and whether the dose of study drug was completely 
infused. For oral fluconazol e (caspofungin group) or oral placebo (CD101 groups), 
treatment compliance will be documented by recording start date, end date, and pill 
counts.

 8.6 BREAKING THE BLIND  
This study is a double -blind design. The PI, study personnel, and subjects will not make 
any effort to determine which study drug therapy is being received. Unblinded pharmacy 
personnel or unblinded study personnel (ie, PK analyst in Part A only and statis tician in 
Part A and Part B) may be utilized in this study.  
The data for the 4 0 to 60 subjects in the mITT population involved in the interim analysis 
will be locked  prior to the unblinded interim analysis, and the database for Part A will be 
locked prior to the Part A analysis. The data from Part A will be unblinded after the 
database is locked  for Part A, but likely prior to completion of Part B, and interim 
summary  results and full Part A summary results will be reported when available.  
Individual subjects will not be unblinded for either the interim analysis or the Part A 
analysis.  Thus, no by -subject data will be made available to the Sponsor until after 
database lock for Part B . (Note: An addendum to the Unblinding Plan for Part A allowed 
for unblinded safety review of adverse events of interest identified during blinded safety 
review; the addendum allowed for no more than 5% of subjects to be unblinded.)  The 
data from Part B will only be unblinded and analyzed after database lock for Part B  at 
completion of the study .  
Only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the 
clinical management or welfare of a specific subject, may t he PI unblind a subject’s 
treatment assignment. Prior to any unblinding, the PI is strongly advised to discuss 
options with the Medical Monitor or appropriate Sponsor study personnel. As soon as 
possible and without revealing the subject’s study treatment assignment (unless important 
to the safety of subjects remaining in the study), the PI must notify the Sponsor if the 
blind is broken for any reason and the PI was unable to contact the Sponsor prior to 
unblinding. The PI will record in source documentation the date and reason for revealing 
the blinded treatment assignment for that subject.  
8.7 PREVIOUS AND CONCOMI TANT MEDICATIONS AND 
SUBSTANCES  
All systemic antifungal therapy administered within 4 weeks and all non -antifungal 
therapy administered within 1 week  prior to randomization in will be documented in the 
CRF. Subjects who received systemic treatment with an antifungal agent at approved 
doses for treatment of candidemia for >48 hours before randomization will be excluded 
from the study.  
Concomitant syste mic antifungal agents, other than those listed as part of study drug 
therapy, are not permitted and their use, for any reason other than the subject being 
considered a treatment failure, must be discussed with the Medical Monitor before 
administration.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 71 of 128 
 Use of concomitant cyclosporine should be limited to subjects for whom potential benefit 
outweighs potential risk of drug -drug interactions with caspofungin. All other 
concomitant medications necessary for the health and wellbeing of the subject are 
permitte d. 
Fluconazole is contraindicated in subjects with hypersensitivity to fluconazole and should 
be used with caution in subjects with hypersensitivity to other azoles. Fluconazole should 
not be co- administered with terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole, erythro mycin, pimozide, 
quinidine, or any other drug metabolized via the cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 enzymatic 
pathway and may cause prolongation of the QT interval. Fluconazole should be 
administered with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic toxicity or liv er dysfunction. 
Patients who have or develop abnormal liver function tests during fluconazole therapy 
should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Hepatic toxicity 
secondary to fluconazole is usually reversible.  
Fluconazole is a p otent CYP2C9 inhibitor and a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor and thus all 
subjects on fluconazole who are concomitantly taking drugs that are also metabolized 
through these pathways should be monitored closely. Please refer to the US Package 
Insert or the Europe an Union Summary of Product Characteristics for fluconazole for 
more information about the contraindications, warnings and precautions, and likely drug -
drug interactions.  
8.8 ACCOUNTABILITY PROCE DURES  
The pharmacy or study personnel are responsible for ensurin g that a current record of 
CD101 IV, caspofungin, fluconazole, and over encapsulated placebo inventory and 
accountability is maintained.  
A Pharmacy Monitor will be responsible for checking drug accountability at the site. 
Inventory records must be readily  available for inspection by regulatory authorities at any 
time. Each shipment of study drug will contain an acknowledgment of receipt section for 
site signature. Upon receipt of study drug, the pharmacy or study personnel will visually 
inspect the shipment and verify the number and condition of vials or capsules received. 
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information.  
8.9 STUDY DRUG HANDLING AND DISPOSAL  
Unless expressly disallowed by institution rules, used and unused vials of study drug 
(including  CD101 and caspofungin) will be retained at the study site until study drug 
accountability has been performed by the Pharmacy Monitor. Upon completion of the 
study, termination of the study, or upon written authorization from the Sponsor, all 
retained unus ed and partially used study drug will be centrally destroyed. All records of 
disposal by a centralized destruction site will be maintained by the Sponsor.  
9.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Study procedures should be completed within the windows provided in the Schedule of 
Assessments and Procedures located in  Table 2. However, if a subject is unable to attend 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 72 of 128 
 a visit within the specified windows, the PI (or qualified des ignee) should discuss 
appropriate scheduling with the Medical Monitor (or appropriate designee).  
For Part A of this study, the blood sample for CD101 PK is a critical parameter and any 
postdose time point for blood sample needs to be collected within the s pecified window. 
All other procedures should be completed as close to the prescribed/scheduled time as 
possible. Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns 
take precedence over all routine scheduled procedures.  
9.1 SCREENING  
Unless otherwise indicated, Screening assessments should be performed within 48 hours 
of randomization.  
• Obtain signed informed consent prior to initiating any study -related assessments or 
procedures. Consent from a legally acceptable representative may b e obtained if the 
subject is unable to consent for themselves  
• Obtain a complete medical history for the last 5 years and Candida risk factors for the 
last 3 months (eg, central line, active malignancy, broad- spectrum antibiotic therapy, 
diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, major surgery, total parenteral nutrition, 
transplant recipient, trauma, dialysis, burns , pancreatitis ) and Intensive Care Unit 
admission and discharge (if applicable)  
• Short -term central venous catheters (eg, peripherally -inserted central catheters, 
internal jugular or subclavian central venous catheters) and long -term central venous 
catheters (eg, tunneled catheters) are recommended to be removed within 48 hours 
after diagnosis with candidemia, consistent with IDSA ( Pappas et al., 2016 ) and 
ESCMID ( Ullmann et al., 2012; Cornely et al., 2012) guidelines.  
• Record all systemic antifungal therapy administered within 4 weeks and all non -
antifungal therapy (including other anti -infective therapy) administered within 1 week 
prior to randomization 
• Clinical assessments  
o Conduct complete physical examination, including height and weight  
o Measure vital signs (temperature and the method used [oral, rectal, temporal, 
tympanic, or core], heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate)  
− Record the highest and lowest daily temperature and the method used (oral, 
rectal, temporal, tympanic, or core), highest and lowest heart rate, highest and 
lowest respiratory rate, and highest and lowest blood pressure measured  
o Perform 12 -lead ECG  before subject randomiz ation 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 73 of 128 
 o Perform retinal examination for Candida eye infection by Day 7  only on subjects 
with candidemia by blood culture . This assessment is the standard of care for 
subjects with candidemia, and ideally would be performed by an ophthalmologist, 
if available.  
o Assess presence or absence of systemic signs and symptoms and determine which 
are attributable to candidemia and/or IC. The Screening period for assessing 
systemic signs for inclusion in the study may include the 4 hours prior to the 
drawing of the qualify ing positive blood culture  (when systemic signs of infection 
resulted in obtaining blood cultures ), qualifying positive culture from a sterile 
site, or sponsor -approved IVD , through enrollment. 
• Laboratory assessments  
○ Prior to the start of the Screening per iod, consider use of a Sponsor -approved 
rapid IVD for Candida spp. while drawing blood culture if the potential subject 
has known risk factors for candidemia and will be administered empiric 
antifungal therapy ( Section 7.1.1)  
− All sites using rapid IVDs must label samples with subject identification 
number and date/time of blood draw and follow all necessary timing and 
procedures required for proper testing and interp retation of results  
− For commercial IVDs, sample handling and storage procedures should follow 
the package insert  
○ A culture must be obtained as part of the standard of care for inclusion in the 
study. Established mycological diagnosis of candidemia suffici ent for inclusion in 
the study will be established by either ≥1 blood culture positive for yeast or 
Candida OR a Sponsor -approved rapid IVD test positive for Candida spp. OR a 
positive Gram stain for yeast or positive culture for Candida spp. from a specim en 
obtained from a normally sterile site from a sample taken ≤96 hours before 
randomization.  
− If the positive blood culture used to qualify the subject for the study is drawn 
>12 hours from randomization, then an additional set of blood cultures must 
be obtained ≤12 hours before randomization. 
− If the subject is suspected of having IC, then all reasonable attempts to obtain 
a culture from the suspected site of infection should be made as early as 
possible before empiric therapy.  
− Perform identification and su sceptibility testing at local laboratory for 
Candida for any positive blood culture  or any positive  culture from normally  
sterile site  
− Record the species and susceptibilities for all bacteria isolated within 1 week 
prior to randomization from blood or any other normally sterile site  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 74 of 128 
 − Send all fungal isolates cultured from blood or normally sterile tissue/fluid to 
the Central Laboratory  
○ Perform urine pregnancy test on female subjects of childbearing potential. Do not 
perform on women who are ≥2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile.  
○ Obtain blood samples for hematology tests, coagulation laboratory tests (PT/INR 
and either PTT or aPTT), and serum chemistry tests ( Appendix 3)  
○ Obtain a urine sample for urinalysis (UA) and microscopy ( Appendix 3)  
• Calculate Child -Pugh score only if the subject has a history of chronic cirrhosis 
(Appendix 4)  
• Record modified Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II 
parameters ( Appendix 5) with Glasgow Coma Score ( Appendix 6) ; note that the 
APACHE II score can be calculated after enrollment, but should use the vital signs 
and laboratory results from the Screening visit.  
• If radiologic test performed, record radiologic test type with Findings and 
Interpretation only if radiologic test provides evidence of IC  
• Assess, identif y, and record any AEs following signing of the ICF  
• Confirm subject qualification by inclusion/exclusion criteria  
9.2 DAYS 1, 2, and 3 
• Randomize subject just prior to dosing (Day 1 only)  
• Administer study drug ( Section 8.0 and Study Pharmacy Manual)  
o IV infusi on of study drug over  60 (±10) minutes on Days 1, 2, and 3; 24 (±2) 
hours after study drug was administered on the previous day (for Days 2 and 3 
only)  
• Clinical assessments 
○ Measure vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate)  
− Record the highest and lowest daily temperature and the method used (oral, 
rectal, temporal, tympanic, or core), highest and lowest heart rate, highest and 
lowe st respiratory rate, and highest and lowest blood pressure measured each 
day 
○ Perform retinal examination for Candida eye infection once by Day 7  only on 
subjects with candidemia by blood culture. This assessment is the standard of care 
for subjects with ca ndidemia, and ideally would be performed by an 
ophthalmologist, if available.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 75 of 128 
 • Laboratory assessments  
○ Obtain blood samples for hematology and serum chemistry tests (Day 2 only) 
(Appendix 3); in general, the laboratory values to be en tered into the eCRF will 
be from the first laboratory samples drawn each day with routine morning 
laboratory samples  
○ Obtain culture from blood and/or normally sterile tissue/fluid if demonstrating 
mycological eradication or if clinically indicated  
− Obtain blood for culture daily (preferred) or every other day until 2 blood 
cultures drawn ≥12 hours apart are negative, without an intervening positive 
culture  
− If feasible, and if there was a previous culture from a site positive for Candida 
spp., obtain culture from normally sterile tissue/fluid from the same site  
− Perform identification and susceptibility testing for Candida for any positive 
culture requiring a change of antifungal therapy  (ie, identification and 
susceptibility testing not required for Candida isolates cultured from 
specimens obtained without a required change in antifungal therapy)  
− All fungal isolates cultured from blood and normally sterile tissue/fluid must 
be sent to the Central Laboratory  
− Record the species and susceptibilities for any new  bacteria isolated from 
blood or any other normally sterile site  
○ In Part A only , obtain blood samples for PK analysis from the OPPOSITE arm of 
the infusion on Day 1 (within 10 minutes [ie, >0 to 10 minutes] before the end of 
infusion, between 15 minutes an d 1 hour after the end of infusion, and between 2 
hours and 12 hours after the end of infusion) and Day 2 (random draw with date 
of sample same as Day 2 date of dose, with safety labs if possible)  
• Record all concomitant medications including prescription, over the counter (OTC), 
and herbal medications  
• If radiologic test performed, record radiologic test type with Findings and 
Interpretation only if radiologic test provides evidence of IC, OR evidence of 
resolution of IC from previous radiographs  
• Assess, ide ntify, and record any AEs  
9.3 DAYS 4  to 7 
• Administer study drug ( Section 8.0 and Study Pharmacy Manual)

o Oral step -down therapy if stepped down (Days 5, 6, and 7)  
― If on oral step -down therapy and discharged from study site, subject must 
mark date/time and number of capsules taken each day in Daily Subject Diary  
• Clinical assessments  
○ Measure vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate) 
only if receiving IV study drug 
− If hospitalized, record the highest and lowest daily temperature and the 
method used (oral, rectal, temporal, tympanic, or core), highest and lowest 
heart rate, highest and lowest respiratory rate, and highest and lowest blood 
pressure measured.  
− Vital signs are required on Days 4 and 5 (temperature, heart rate, blood 
pressure, respiratory rate)  
− For subje cts discharged from the hospital and in the community, vital signs 
(temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) are only performed 
on Days 6 to 7 if the subject is seen for clinical assessment or IV study drug 
infusion 
○ Perform retinal examination for Candida eye infection once by Day 7  only on 
subjects with candidemia by blood culture . This assessment is the standard of care 
for subjects with candidemia, and ideally would be performed by an 
ophthalmologist, if available.  
○ Assess presence or absence of systemic signs and determine which are 
attributable to candidemia and/or IC (Day 5 only)   
• Laboratory assessments  
○ Obtain blood samples for hematology and serum chemistry tests (Day 4 only) 
(Appendix 3);  in general, the laboratory values to be entered into the eCRF will

• ≥14 days of study drug 
• The subject’s clinical status is considered stable based on Investigator assessment  
• All systemic signs attributable to candidemia and/or IC that were present at baseline 
have resolved  
• For subjects with IC, there is documented or presumed eradication of IC

 • PI to assess clinical response. Refer to Table 11 for definitions of clinical cure and 
failure  
• Record all concomitant medications including prescription, OTC, and herbal 
medications  
• If radiologic test performed, record radiologic test type w ith Findings and 
Interpretation only if radiologic test provides evidence of IC, OR evidence of 
resolution of IC from previous radiographs  
• Assess, identify, and record any AEs  
10.0 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
10.1 SAFETY PARAMETERS  
Safety will be assessed from the signing of the ICF at Screening to the FU visit through 
the evaluation of AEs, vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory data (clinical chemistry 
panels and hematology and UA evaluations) according to the Schedule of Assessments 
and Procedures ( Table 2) and Appendix 3.  
10.2 ADVERSE EVENTS  
AEs will be collected for all subjects from informed consent. The Investigator will assess 
all AEs and SAEs and will record the following information on the appropriate eCRF 
page:  
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution or stabilization  
• Severity  
• Relationship to study drug  
• Action taken with study medication  
Medically indicated laboratory tests (emergency or unscheduled tests) should be 
conducted at the local laboratory. The Investigator should employ best medical judgment 
in determining how to manage AEs and SAEs. Any questions regarding AE or SAE 
management should be directed to the Medical Monitor. 
10.3 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
The Sponsor has requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific criteria 
to worldwide regulatory authorities. Therefore, the Sponsor must be notified immediately 
regarding any SAE that occurs after informed consent.  
All SAEs must be reported to the Medical Monitor by phone or email within 24 hours of 
the investigational site’s knowledge of the event.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 93 of 128 
 The study site will also transmit a Serious Adverse Event Report (SAER) to the safety 
vendor by facsimile or email within 24 hours. Contact details will be provided to all sites. 
An optional initial report can be made via telephone, but a completed SAER must still be 
faxed or emailed within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the event. The 
Investigational site will be provided with SAER forms wherein the following information 
is requested.  
• Subject identification, Investigator name, and site number  
• SAE information: event term, onset date, severity, and causal relationship 
• The outcomes attributable to the event (eg, death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient 
hospitalization, prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity, or other important medical event[s])  
• A summary of relevant test results, pertinent laboratory data, and any other relev ant 
medical history  
• The first and last dates of study drug administration. NOTE: as this is a double -blind 
study, SAERs should not indicate specific study drug assignments  
• Indicate if the study drug was discontinued or the study drug administration schedul e 
modified  
• Supplemental information may include the following hospital records: laboratory 
results, radiology reports, progress notes, admission and emergency room notes, 
holding and observation notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death 
certif icates  
In addition, relevant case report form pages should be appended to communicate relevant 
study drug and subject outcome information. The SAER should be faxed or emailed 
within 24 hours with as much of the above information as available at the time. T he 
following minimum information is required for reporting an SAE: subject identification, 
reporting source, and an event or outcome. Supplemental information may be transmitted 
using a follow -up report and should not delay the initial report. The Sponsor may contact 
the investigational site to solicit additional information or follow up on the event.  
The Investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE. 
Any medications or procedures necessary for treatment of the SAE mus t be recorded on 
the appropriate pages of the subject’s eCRF.  
10.4 DEFINITIONS  
10.4.1 Adverse Event  
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically -significant 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 94 of 128 
 abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
a drug, and does not imply any judgment about causality. An AE can arise with any us e 
of the drug (eg, off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route 
of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Events that are related to the disease under study, candidemia, should not be considered 
or recorded as AEs unless the event fits the definition for an SAE ( Section 10.4.4), in 
which case the SAE form must be submitted for safety reporting in the appropriate 
timefr ame and entered as an AE into the eCRF.  
Laboratory abnormalities should not be recorded as AEs or SAEs unless they are 
associated with clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. However, 
each laboratory abnormality (eg, clinically signifi cant changes detected on hematology, 
comprehensive metabolic panel, UA) independent from any underlying medical condition 
that requires medical or surgical intervention, or that leads to interruption of study drug 
infusion or discontinuation, must be recor ded as an AE, or SAE if applicable. If the 
laboratory abnormality is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded 
as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than as the individual laboratory abnormality. In 
addition, laboratory abnormalities or  other abnormal test assessments (eg, ECGs) that are 
associated with signs or symptoms must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the 
definition of an AE (or SAE) as described in Section 10.4.1 (or Section 10.4.4).  
10.4.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degre e of certainty about causality than 
adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
10.4.3 Life-Threatening A dverse Event  or Life- Threatening Suspected 
Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life threatening’’ if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had 
it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
10.4.4 Serious A dverse Ev ent or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE – see definition above  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 95 of 128 
 • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outc omes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Hospitalization for a planned or elective procedure or surgery for a pre -existing condition 
that has not worsened is not considered a serious adverse event.  
10.4.5 Unexpected A dverse Event  or Unexpected Suspected Adverse 
React ion 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’:  
• If it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed, or  
• If an Investigator Brochure is not required or available, is  not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application, as amended  
• If it is not listed in the Prescribing Information (for marketed products)  
For example, under this definition, hepa tic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of 
greater severity) if the Investigator Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or 
hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be 
unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator Brochure listed only 
cerebral vascular accidents.  
‘‘Unexpected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator Brochure as occurring with a class of 
drugs  or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
10.5 ADVERSE EVENT CLASSI FICATION 
10.5.1 Relationship to Investigational Drug 
The Investigator’s assessmen t of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-
serious) (Table 7). An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whethe r 
there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an AE. 
Clinical failure that qualifies as an AE without evidence of study drug toxicity should be 
considered unrelated to study drug.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 96 of 128 
 These criteria, in addition to good c linical judgment, should be used as a guide for 
determining the causal assessment. If the event is thought to be unrelated to study drug 
administration, then an alternative explanation should be provided.  
Table 9:  Guidelines for Assessing Relationship of Event to Study Drug   
Unrelated  There is little or no chance that the Investigational Product 
caused the AE; other conditions, including concurrent illnesses, 
progression or expression of the disease state, or a reaction to a 
conc omitant medication best explain the event  
Related  The association of the AE with the Investigational Product is 
unknown, however, the AE is not clearly due to another 
condition, or a reasonable temporal association exists between 
the AE and treatment administration and, based on the 
Investigator's clinical experience, the association of the AE with 
the Investigational Product seems likely  
AE = adverse event.  
10.5.2 Severity  
All AEs will be graded for severity ( Table 8).  
The Investigator will use the terms: Mild, Moderate, or Severe to describe the maximum 
intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as 
follows:  
Table 10:  Guidelines for Severity Assessments  
Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
Moderate  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate  instrumental activities of daily 
living  
Severe  Disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living; 
urgent intervention indicated; death related to an AE  
AE = adverse event.  
10.5.3 Serious Adverse Event  
Any adverse experience occurring at any dose of study medication that occurs between 
the time of informed consent and the FU visit (Days 45 to 52 for subjects with 
candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without candidemia) that 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening situation (subject is at immediate risk of death)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 97 of 128 
 • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received st udy drug 
• Events that jeopardize the subject sufficiently that medical or surgical intervention 
may be required to prevent one of the above outcomes. Examples may include, but 
are not limited, to: 
○ Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for alle rgic bronchospasm  
○ Blood dyscrasias that do not result in hospitalization 
○ Seizures that do not result in hospitalization  
10.5.3.1  SAE definition clarifications  
• Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself  
• All deaths during study drug administration or up to the FU visit (Days 45 to 52 for 
subjects with candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without 
candidemia), regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported  
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is actively receiv ing study 
drug at the time of the event  
• “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred. This does not include an event that might have led to death, had 
it occurred with greater severity.  
• Complication s that occur during hospitalizations are AEs. If an AE prolongs 
hospitalization, it is an SAE.  
• “Inpatient hospitalization” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospital 
for medical reasons, for any length of time. This may or may not be overni ght. It does 
not include presentation and care within an emergency department (although an 
emergency department visit may define a medically important event, which is also 
considered an SAE).  
• The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE or SAE, rather than as the individual signs or symptoms. 
10.6 ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOW -UP 
All unresolved SAEs (“ongoing” at discharge) will be followed by the study staff until 
resolution or deemed stable. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 98 of 128 
 10.7 ADVERSE EVENTS OF SP ECIAL INTEREST  
10.7.1 CD101 IV Intolerability 
Events that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may represent intolerance of the IV 
infusion of IV study drug must be recorded as AEs on the eCRF. In general, these events 
will be temporally related to IV echinocandin infusion.  
10.7.2 Phototoxicity  
Results from a phototoxicity study in rats indicate evidence of phototoxicity at elevated 
CD101 exposures ( Section 4.3). Although there is not yet any evidence of risk to humans, 
Investigators should advise subjects to avoid sun exposure without adequate protection 
and to report any AE potentially related  to phototoxicity to the Sponsor.  
10.7.3 Neuropathy and Tremors  
In a CD101 3- month toxicity study in monkeys, there were observations of tremors, 
intention tremors, and histology consistent with Schwann cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy 
and axonal degeneration (potentially consistent with clinical presentation of neuropathy ) 
first appearing at week 6 of dosing and at 11- fold the exposure for Group 2. A taxia, 
axonal neuropathy, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, peripheral motor neuropathy, peripheral  
neuropathy, peripheral sensory neuropathies, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, 
polyneuropathy, toxic neuropathy, and tremors  will be included in adverse events of 
special interest.  
10.8 TOXICITY MANAGEMENT  
The Investigator should employ best medical judgment in determining how to manage 
AEs. Any questions regarding AE management should be directed to the Medical 
Monitor. 
10.9 RISKS FOR WOMEN OF CHILD -BEARING POTENTI AL OR 
DURING PREGNANCY 
The risks of CD101 IV administration during pregnancy have not been evaluate d. 
Pregnant or lactating females who are nursing are excluded from this study.  
Subjects must be instructed to inform the Investigator immediately  if they or their partner 
becomes pregnant during the study. Partners must complete informed consent to allow 
the investigator to follow them for the outcome of the pregnancy. In the event of a 
confirmed pregnancy, the following actions should be taken:  
• Study drug should be discontinued immediately in all (and in only) female subjects  
• The pregnancy should be reported within 24 hours of notification using the applicable 
Pregnancy Report Form  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 99 of 128 
 • The Investigator should counsel the subject regarding the possible effects of prior 
CD101 IV exposure on the fetus and the need to inform the study site of the outcome 
of the pregnancy 
• The subject or subject’s partner (if consented) should be monitored until the 
immediate postnatal period or until termination of the pregnancy. The outcome 
should be reported using the Pregnancy Outcome or Abnormal Pregnancy Outcome 
form.  
Pregnanc y is not an AE, in and of itself. However, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or 
SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered an SAE and will be reported as 
described in the A E and SAE sections. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse 
pregnancy outcome post -study must be reported to the Medical Monitor.  
10.10 RISKS FOR MALES OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIA L 
Recent result s from a CD101 nonclinical rat fertility study indicated adverse effects on 
sperm morphology and motility without interference with reproduction at 2.5 times the 
exposure of rezafungin Group 2. The risks for CD101 effects on spermatogenesis in non-
human primates and in h umans have yet to be defined. Partner pregnancies of male 
subjects should be followed according to Section 10.9, when possible. 
11.0 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY PARAMETERS  
Mycological response will be programmatically determined at Day 5, Day 14 (±1 day), 
Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC), and FU (Days 45- 52 for subjects with 
candidemia only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without candidemia) in the 
mITT population as defined in Table 9.

• If positive culture from a normally sterile site: A sterile site tissue/fluid 
specimen was not available to culture or the result was not available AND an 
assessment of signs of invasive candidiasis was not available 
• Subject is lost to follow up on the day of assessment  
The primary efficacy outcome is overall response and is determined programmatically 
from the mycological response and assessment of systemic signs attributable to 
candidemia and/or IC ( Table 10). The  signs that may be present at baseline and 
attributable to candidemia and/or IC include fever, hypothermia, hypotension, 
tachycardia, and tachypnea ( Section 7.1.2).  Subjects who require a change of antifungal 
therapy to treat candidemia and/or IC prior to a given day of the overall response 
assessment (Day 5, Day 14, or FU visit) should have the assessment of systemic signs

 attributable to candidemia and/or IC moved forward to the early EOT evaluation. 
Assessments of systemic signs performed prior to the early EOT will be unaffected.

(±2 days; only for subjects with IC), and FU, as detailed in Table 11. Subjects whose 
disease is progressing or who receive rescue antifungal therapy for candidemia prior to 
the Day 14 (±1 day) visit will be considered a clinical failure at the Day 14, Day 28 ( ±2 
days; only for subjects with IC), and FU visits. Subjects who are a clinical cure at Day 14 
(±1 day) and whose systemic signs or symptoms recur between Day 14 (±1 day) and Day

• Withdrawal of consent  
• Extenuating circumstances that preclude the classification of clinical outcome of 
candidemia and/or IC  
AE = adverse event; IC = inv asive candidiasis; IV = intravenous  
a. Prolonged antifungal therapy is defined as therapy for the treatment of candidemia extending beyond 
the allowable 21 days of study drug or for the treatment of IC extending beyond the allowable 28 days 
of study drug. The  determination of prolonged therapy will only apply to the Follow -up visit clinical 
response assessment.  
12.0 ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS  (Part A 
only)  
Blood PK samples will be drawn from the OPPOSITE arm of the infusion at the 
following specified time points.  
Blood for PK analyses will be drawn on Day 1 (within 10 minutes [ie, >0 to 10 minutes] 
before the end of infusion, between 15 minutes and 1 hour after the end of infusion, and 
between 2 hours and 12 hours after the end of infusion), Day 2 (random draw with date of 
sample same as Day 2 date of dose, with safety labs if possible), Day 4 (random draw 
with date of sample same as Day 4 date of dose, with safety labs if possible), Day 8 
(predose only), and Day 15 (predose only). Day 8 and Day 15 PK draws should be 
performed within 30 minutes before the second and third dose of study drug, regardless 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 103 of 128 
 of the exact day and time of these infusions. If therapy is stopped on or before Day 14 
and there is no Day 15 dose, then the Day 15 PK sample should be drawn with the safety 
laboratory samples for the Day 14 visit. Ideally, PK samples would be drawn with the 
safety laboratory samples for that day to prevent multiple needle sticks.  
For the purpose of maintaining the blind, blood samples will be collected fr om all 
subjects, when possible, in all 3 treatment groups in Part A, but only PK samples from 
the CD101 IV groups will be analyzed (using a validated assay) by an independent, 
central bioanalytical laboratory. When >1 assessment occurs at any time point, t he PK 
blood sample will be given priority and taken at the correct protocol -specified time. 
Procedures for collection, storage, and shipping of PK samples are described in 
Appendix  7. 
Plasma samples from all subjects who received CD101 IV will be analyzed by liquid 
chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) for the concentration of 
CD101. The plasma PK parameters of CD101 IV will be determined based upon the 
CD101 concentrations. 
13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
This is an exploratory study and, therefore, it is not powered for inferential statistical 
analyses.  
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, 
and the numbers, means, standard deviations, medians, minimums and maximums for 
continuous variables, will be provided by study drug (CD101 IV or caspofungin). All 
data will be summarized separately by study drug. Listings of individual subject data will 
also be produced. All analyses will be completed for Part A. Selected analyses will be 
completed only for Part B and for Part A and B combined. 
To demonstrate preliminary efficacy and safety of CD101 and to confirm the correct 
CD101 dose regimen is utilized  in Part B, an unblinded interim analysis will be  
performed after approximately 4 0 to 60 subjects in the mITT population have been 
enrolled and completed study drug therapy. This unblinded interim analysis of a few key 
efficacy and safety outcom es will be performed by an independent unblinded statistician. 
Interim efficacy and safety summary t ables will be produced, but the identity of the group 
assignment for each individual subject will remain blinded until the completion of the 
study and the database for both Parts A and B are locked . Once Part A is completed, the 
database will be locked  and a full unblinded analysis with all summary tables will be 
performed on Part A alone. As with the initial interim analysis and to help avoid bias, the 
full Part A analysis will be performed by an independent unblinded statistician, keeping 
the identity of the group assignment for each individual subject blinded until the 
completion of the study and the database for both Parts A and B are locked .

 A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before the interim 
analysis. Any changes to the SAP from the time of the interim analysis to the final 
database lock of Part B will be documented in an addendum to the SAP. Any deviations 
from the final SAP/addendum will be described and justified in the study report. All 
statistical analyses will be pe rformed using SAS®. All analyses will be completed for 
Part A. Selected analyses will be completed only for Part B and for Part A and B 
combined. 
13.1 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
Analysis populations are:  
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population: all randomized subjects  
• Safet y population: all subjects who receive any amount of study drug 
• The Microbiological Intent -to-treat (mITT)  population: all subjects who had 
documented Candida infection based on Central Laboratory evaluation of a blood 
culture obtained within 96 hours of randomization, or from a specimen obtained from 
a normally sterile site, and received ≥1 dose of study drug 
o  
13.2 ANALYSIS OF STUDY PO PULATION AND SUBJECT  
CHARACTERISTICS  
Demographics (including age, race, and gender), diagnosis (candidemia and/or IC), 
medical history including Candida risk factors, baseline assessments (including height, 
weight, BMI, modified APACHE II score, and Glasgow coma score), mycological data, 
systemic signs and symptoms, and administration of study drug will be summarized in 
the ITT an d mITT populations. All analyses will be conducted for Part A only. The SAP 
will detail which analyses are conducted for Part B and for Parts A and B combined.  
13.3 SAFETY ANALYSES  
All subjects who receive any amount of study drug (Safety population) will be i ncluded 
in the safety analyses.  All safety analyses will be conducted for Part A only and for Parts 
A and B combined.  
Safety will be evaluated by presenting summaries of AEs, clinical laboratory evaluations 
(hematology evaluation, chemistry panel, and UA), vital signs, and ECGs. Safety 
variables will be tabulated by treatment group.  
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 105 of 128 
 Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). AEs will be collected for each subject from the signing of the ICF at 
Screening throug h the last study visit at FU (Days 45 to 52 for subjects with candidemia 
only or Days 52- 59 for subjects with IC, with or without candidemia). A treatment -
emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that occurs during or after study 
drug administration and up through the FU visit. The incidence of TEAEs will be 
presented by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term, by SOC, preferred term , and 
relationship to the study drug administration, and by SOC, preferred term , and severity. 
In addition, the i ncidence of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
study drug (IV and IV/oral) will be presented by SOC and preferred term .  
Descriptive statistics for clinical laboratory test results, ECG parameters and vital signs, 
and for changes from baseline, will be presented by time point. Baseline is defined as the 
measurement closest to, but prior to, the administration of study drug. Incidences of 
potentially clinically significant clinical laboratory results, ECG parameters, and vital 
signs, as defined in the SAP, will also be summarized by time point.  
13.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
The number and percentage of subjects with an overall success (m ycological 
eradication/presumed eradication and resolution of systemic signs of candidemia and/or 
IC that were present at baseline), failure, and indeterminate response at Day 14 in the 
mITT population will be presented. Exact 2- sided 95% CIs for the point  estimates of 
overall success in each treatment group will be determined using the Clopper -Pearson 
method. Additional analysis of the primary efficacy outcome will be conducted. The 
number and percentage of subjects with each overall response (success, fai lure, 
indeterminate) will be determined separately for subjects with candidemia and with IC in 
the mITT population. Analyses will be conducted for Part A, Part B, and for Parts A and 
B combined.  
The number and percentage of subjects with each overall response (success, failure, 
indeterminate) will be determined in those subjects in the mITT population who did not 
receive concomitant antifungal therapy in addition to study drug and will be determined 
in those subjects with and without a positive blood cultur e at baseline for Candida spp. 
For this analysis, a baseline culture is defined as one taken within 12 hours before 
randomization. Subjects will be included in the positive culture at baseline group i f the 
baseline blood culture is negative , or not done and the first blood culture after receipt of 
study drug is positive . Exact 2 -sided 95% CIs for the point estimates of success in each 
treatment group will be determined using the Clopper -Pearson method. Analyses will be 
conducted for Part A and for Parts A a nd B combined. 
The number and percentage of subjects with an overall success, failure, and indeterminate 
response at Day 5, Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC), and at FU in the mITT 
population will be presented by treatment group. Exact 2- sided 95% CIs for the point 
estimates of success in each treatment group will be determined using the Clopper -
Pearson method. Analyses will be conducted for Part A, Part B, and for Parts A and B 
combined. 
Cidara Therapeutics, Inc.        Protocol CD101.IV.2.03 A6 
Intravenous CD101    
Protocol Amendment 6 Confidential  Page 106 of 128 
 An additional analysis of overall response at FU will be conducted in which subjects who 
received a non -study antifungal after Day 21 for the treatment of an infection other than 
the candidemia (or after Day 28 for the treatment of an infection other than IC) will be 
excluded. Analyses will be conducted for Part A  and for Parts A and B combined. 
Mycological outcome will be summarized by treatment group  in the mITT population. 
The number and percentage of subjects with a success (mycological 
eradication/presumed eradication), failure, and indeterminate response at D ay 5, Day 14, 
Day 28 (±2 days; only for subjects with IC) and at FU in the mITT population will be 
presented. Exact 2 -sided 95% CIs for the point estimates of success in each treatment 
group will be determined using the Clopper -Pearson method. Analyses wil l be conducted 
for Part A, Part B, and for Parts A and B combined. Mycological outcome will also be 
analyzed in the subgroup of subjects with only a positive  rapid in vitro diagnostic result 
and with only a positive baseline blood culture.  
The number and percentage of subjects with a clinical cure, failure, and indeterminate 
response based on the Investigator's assessment at Day 14, Day 28 (±2 days; only for 
subjects with IC), and at FU in the mITT population will be presented by treatment 
group. Exact 2- sided 95% CIs for the point estimates of success in each treatment group 
will be determined using the Clopper -Pearson method. Analyses will be conducted for 
Part A, Part B, and for Parts A and B combined.  
An additional analysis of Investigator's assessment of clinical response at FU will be 
conducted in which subjects who receive a non -study antifungal after Day 21 for the 
treatment of an infection other than the candidemia (or after Day 28 for the treatment of 
an infection other than IC) will be excluded. A nalyses will be conducted for Part A and 
for Parts A and B combined. 
The number and percentage of subjects who died up through the FU Visit (all -cause 
mortality) will be presented by treatment group. Kaplan -Meier methods will be utilized to 
analyze the tim e to the first negative blood culture (for those subjects enrolled with a 
positive blood culture). Time to negative blood culture will be defined as the time to the 
first of the 2 negative blood cultures drawn ≥12 hours apart, without an intervening 
positi ve culture. Subjects will be censored if they receive an alternative antifungal (ie, 
other than study drug) for the treatment of the candidemia, or if they are lost to follow up 
prior to having 2 negative blood cultures. Analyses will be conducted for Part  A and for 
Parts A and B combined.  
13.5 PHARMACOKINETIC ANAL YSES ( Part A only )  
Plasma samples from subjects who received ≥1 complete dose of CD101 IV will be 
analyzed for the concentration of CD101 by a validated LC -MS/MS method in the PK 
Analysis population. Due to the sparse sampling for PK in this protocol, plasma 
concentrations will primarily be used to support population PK modeling in patients. PK 
parameter assessment will be reported separately for the PK Analysis population and may 
include: C max, Tmax, AUC 0-168, and area under the CD101 concentration time curve from 
time zero to infinity [AUC 0-∞], if applicable.

 13.6 DETERMINATION OF STUDY SAMPLE SIZE  
This is an exploratory study and therefore, is not powered for inferential statistical 
analyses. A sufficient  number of subjects are randomized to the CD101 IV and 
caspofungin groups in Part A to provide an initial, substantive analysis of safety, 
tolerability, and estimate efficacy.  
In Part A, subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) until there are approximately 30 subjects in 
the CD101 IV treatment Group 1, 30 subjects in the CD101 IV treatment Group 2, and 30 
subjects in the comparator group in the mITT population. It is expected that 
approximately 114 subjects will need to be randomized to achieve 90 subjects in t he 
mITT population (assuming 80% of randomized subjects will be included in the mITT 
population). 
In Part B, subjects will be randomized (2:1) until there are ≥30 subjects in the CD101 IV 
treatment group s at any dose and ≥15 subjects in the comparator group (≥45 additional 
subjects and no more than 120 subjects). Total enrollment will depend on the enrollment 
rate for the 6 - to 8- month period between the end of Part A and the start of the Phase 3 
study , which is the trigger for Part B to stop enrollment . 
In Part A, assuming a 73% overall success rate, the sample size of 30 subjects in each 
CD101 IV group will yield a 95% CI of 53.8% to 87.5%. With the addition of Part B 
subjects and assuming a 73% overall success rate, a total approximate sample size of 60 
subjects in the CD101 treatment group (consisting of Group 1 from Amendment 5 and 
Group 2 from Amendment 6)  will yield a 95% CI of 60.0% to 83.7%, and a total 
approximate sample size of 1 10 subjects in the CD101 treatment group (consisting of 
Group 1 from Amendment 5 and Group 2 from Amendment 6)  will yield a 95% CI of 
63.7% to 81.0%. 
13.7 HANDLING OF DROPOUTS  AND MISSING, UNUSED, AND 
SPURIOUS DATA  
Every effort will be made to collect all data at specified times. For the primary and 
secondary efficacy outcomes, subjects with missing outcome data are considered to have 
an indeterminate response. Subjects with an indeterminate response are included in the 
denominator of the response calculation and thus, are treated in the same manner as  
failures in the analysis. Substitutions for other missing data will be specified in the SAP.  
13.8 TERMINATION CRITERIA 
Enrollment and withdrawals from the study and from study drug will be summarized by 
treatment group.  
13.9 DEVIATION REPORTING  
Protocol deviations  will be summarized by treatment group. Protocol deviations are 
defined as any variation from the protocol, including enrollment of a subject who did not 
meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria and failure to perform the assessments and 
procedures within the required time frame.

 APPENDIX 2: CREATINI NE CLEARANCE  
In the event the local laboratory does not calculate creatinine clearance based on the most 
recent serum creatinine value, estimate the patient’s creatinine clearance using the serum 
creatinine value provided by the local laboratory, actual body weight, and the appropriate  
Cockcroft -Gault formula. If necessary, convert serum creatinine values from µmol/L to 
mg/dL by dividing by 88.4. For example, 100 µmol/L divided by 88.4 equals 
1.131 mg/dL:  
 
Males:  
creatinine clearance = (140 – [ insert age in years ]) × [ insert weight in kg ]  
                  72 × [ insert serum creatinine in mg/dL ] 
Females:  
creatinine clearance = 0.85 × (140 – [ insert age in years ]) × [ insert weight in kg]   
                              72 × [ insert serum creatinine in mg/dL ]

 APPENDIX 4: CHILD- PUGH SCORE  
Calculate the Child -Pugh score only if the subject has a history of chronic cirrhosis.  
The Child- Pugh score employs 5 clinical measures of liver disease. Each measure is 
scored 1 to 3, with 1 indicating the least severe and 3 indicating the most severe score. 
The sum of the 5 measures is the total Child -Pugh point score.

a. Mean arterial pressure = (systolic blood pressure + 2 diastolic blood pressure)/3  
b. Acute Renal Failure = a 0.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine if the baseline serum creatinine was ≤1.9 mg/dL, a 1.0 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine 
if the baseline  serum creatinine was 2.0 to 4.9 mg/dL, and a 1.5 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine if the baseline serum creatinine was ≥5.0  mg/dL.  
c. Organ insufficiency or immunocompromised state must have been evident prior  to this hospital admission and conform to the following criteria:  
• Liver – biopsy proven cirrhosis and documented portal hypertension; episodes of past upper gastrointestinal bleeding attributed to portal hypertension; 
or prior episodes of hepatic failure/encephalopathy/coma.  
• Cardiovascular – New Yor k Heart Association Class IV.  
• Respiratory  – Chronic restrictive, obstructive, or vascular disease resulting in severe exercise restriction (ie, unable to climb stairs or  perform household 
duties; or documented chronic hypoxia, hypercapnia, secondary polyc ythemia, severe pulmonary hypertension (>40 mmHg), or respirator 
dependency.  
• Renal – receiving chronic dialysis.  
• Immunocompromised  – the patient has received therapy that suppresses resistance to infection (eg, immunosuppression, chemotherapy, radiation,  long 
term or recent high dose steroids, or has a disease that is sufficiently advanced to suppress resistance to infection, eg, le ukemia, lymphoma, AIDS).

2. Mix the blood with the anticoagulant by gently inverting the tube 8 to 10 times, 
and then immediately place the tube on wet ice.  It is preferable to leave the 
sample on wet ice for 5 to 10 minutes  before centrifuging.   
3. Centrifuge the blood samples for approximately 10 minutes at approximately 
1006g in a centrifuge within approximately 60 minutes after blood sample 
collection.  
4. Immediately following centrifugation, gently remove the plasma from the packed 
cells and aliquot i nto 2 transfer vials. Into the first, aliquot ≥0.5 mL of plasma, 
and, into the second, aliquot the rest. 
5. Replace the caps on the transfer vials and freeze the samples immediately at 
approximately  -20°C or colder.  
6. Note: No more than 60 minutes should elaps e between blood collection and 
freezing the plasma samples.  
7. Keep the samples frozen at  approximately  -20°C or colder until shipment. 
8. Ship the primary sample on dry ice; retain the frozen backup sample until receipt 
of instructions regarding its shipment.  
Note: Wet ice is defined as a mixture of ice and water.

1.Introduction 
This document describes the rules and conventions to be used in the presentation and 
analysis of efficacy and safety data for protocol 093-050.  It describes, in detail, the data and endpoints to be summarized and analyzed, including specifics of the 
statistical analyses to be performed .   
This Statistical Analysis and Reporting P lan (SAP) is based on protocol version 6.0, 
dated 7June2013. 
2. Study objectives 
The objective of this study is to confirm the long-term safety and maintenance of 
effect of eslicarbazepine acetate (flexible dose range of 800  mg to 2400 mg) in 
subjects with partial onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, not well controlled by current AEDs.   
2.1. Prim ary objective 
To evaluate the 1-Year Open -Label Period  and Post-1- Year Open -Label Period  safety 
and tolerability of eslicarbazepine acetate flexible dosing within the range of 800 mg 
to 2400 mg in subjects with partial epilepsy who have participated in an 18- week 
double-blind eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy study (Protocols 093-045 or 093-046).   
2.2. Secondary objectives  
• To evaluate the maintenance of the therapeutic effects of eslicarbazepine acetate 
over a 1-Year Open -Label Period  and Post-1- Year Open -Label Period.   
• To evaluate the health -related quality -of-life, suicidality, and depre ssive 
symptoms over a 1- Year Open -Label Period  and Post-1- Year Open -Label Period .   
3. Study design  
3.1. General Description  
This study is a long -term, multicenter, open -label, safety extension study in male and 
female subjects (aged 16 to 70 years, inclusive) with partial onset seizures who have 
just completed, discontinued, or exited the 18-week treatment phase of Protocols 093-045 or 093-046.  The initial study duration is 1-Year Open -Label Period  with the 
option of continuing study drug treatment Post-1- Year Open -Label Period until a 
subject discontinues study, the study drug becomes clinically available in the subject’s locale, or the sponsor terminates the study drug clinical development program.   
This study will evaluate the safety and maintenance of  effect of long -term 
eslicarbazepine acetate treatment at flexible doses in the range of 800 mg to 2400 mg 
once-a-day (QD) over a 1-Year Open -Label Period  and a Post-1-Year Open -Label 
Period.

Subjects who enter the present study will receive a starting d ose of 1600 mg QD of 
eslicarbazepine acetate, orally for 1 week at the start of the 1-Year Open -Label Period.  
The starting dose for subjects who had a dose reduction during participation in studies 
093-045 or 093-046 will be 1200 mg and not 1600 mg.  At the end of this 1- week 
period, subjects will be allowed to continue at this dose or at the discretion of the Investigator, increase, or decrease dose as necessary for efficacy or tolerability reasons.  There is no limit on the number of dose increments or reductions during the 
study, however, all dose increases or reductions should occur in steps of 400 mg and a minimum of 1 week must pass between one dose change and the next.  Dose 
reductions of more than 400 mg are allowed at the discretion of the Investig ator for a 
documented safety reason .  The maximum allowed dose of eslicarbazepine acetate is 
2400 mg QD and the minimum allowed dose is 800 mg QD in this study .  Subjects 
who continue into the Post-1- Year Open -Label Period  part of the study will continue 
to receive the same dose of study drug that they received at Visit 7 (end of 1-Year 
Open-Label Period  of treatment) .  The same dosing rules as in the 1- Year Open -Label 
Period part of the study are applicable in the Post-1-Year Open -Label Period  part.  
Subjects with a clinically significant increase in seizure frequency, duration, or severity, who have not responded to or did not tolerate an increase in dose of study drug, may be started on an additional antiepileptic drug (AED) during both the 1- Year 
Open-Label Period  and Post-1-Year Open -Label Period  parts of the study.  A 
maximum of two additional AEDs to control seizures will be allowed, however oxcarbazepine will not be allowed .  If, after the addition of the second additional 
AED, the subject experiences  an adverse event, the dose of eslicarbazepine acetate 
should be reduced before changing the dose of the concomitant AED.  In addition, for subjects with a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS), the device setting may be changed as needed.   
Subjects who require doses outside of the 800 mg QD to 2400 mg QD range or more than 2 additional AEDs during the 1- Year Open -Label Period  or Post-1- Year Open -
Label Period  parts of the study will be discontinued from study participation.   
Physicians may p rescribe lorazepam for rescue use.  Diazepam (rectal gel) as an 
emergency medication will be provided by the sponsor (via prescription from local physician) .  In countries where lorazepam and/or diazepam rectal gel are not available, 
alternate treatments are allowed per Appendices XII and XIII in the protocol.

3.3. Determination of Sample Size 
Subjects will continue on to this study from Protocols 093-045 or 093-046 as of their 
own choosing.  Therefore, the sample size is outside of statistical considerations .   
4. Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analysis 
4.1. Changes in the Conduct of the Study 
Six amendments have been incorporated into protocol 093-050 since final protocol. 
4.2. Changes from Analyses Planned in the Protocol  
 The following change was made to the analysis planned in the protocol. This change was made prior to finalization of the SAP and prior to database lock. The protocol in Section 7.2.3 indicates that the fraction of subjects who completed 
treatment at each visit post-1- year will be summarized . The change to this endpoint is 
that the fraction of subjects who completed treatment only for the entire post -1-year 
period will be summarized.

5.2. Efficacy Assessment and Endpoint s 
5.2.1. Assessments
Each subject will be instructed to keep a seizure diary and record information on all 
seizures for the first one -year of the study starting from Visit 1 (Screening) and ending 
at Visit 7 .  Subjects or caregivers can complete the study diary; however the person 
who maintains the diary should remain the same throughout the study .  Seizure 
occurrences since the previous visit, based on review of the seizure diary, will be 
recorded by date and seizure type on the eCRF .  At return visits 2 through 7, the 
seizure diary will be reviewed, and collected.   
The 31-Item Quality of Life in Epilepsy Scale (QOLIE -31)1 will be self -administered 
by only subjects who have completed 18 years of age at time of signing informed consent in Protocols 093-045 or 093-046.   
The Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
2 measures the severity 
of a subject’s depressive symptoms.  MADRS will be performed by a credentialed and 
trained MADRS rater.  The Patient Global Impression (PGI) scale measures the patient impression of 
improvement in disease.  The PGI will be subject self -administered at all visits during 
the Post-1-Year Open -Label Period  only.  The 5 individua l items will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics for each Post-1- Year Open -Label Period  visit.   
5.2.2. 1-Year Open -Label Period  Efficacy  Endpoints  
1. Time on eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy   
Time on eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy during 1- Year Open -Label Period will 
be calculated from the date of the first eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy dose in 
protocol 093-045 or 093-046 (Visit 6/Week 8) to the last known dose of eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy during 1-Year Open -Label Period as follow s; 
a. For a subject who added a non- rescue AED during 1-Year Open -Label Period , 
Time on Monotherapy during 1- Year Open -Label Period  is calculated as the 
date of start a non-rescue AED during 1 Year Open- Label Period minus the 
date of the first  monotherapy dose in protocol 093-045 or 093-046.    
b. For a subject who completed the 1 -Year Open -Label Period, and did not add 
any non-rescue AED since the date of the first monotherapy dose in protocol 
093-045 or 093-046, Time on Monotherapy during 1- Year Open -Label Period 
is calculated as the date of the last known dose during 1- Year Open -Label 
Period, minus the date of the first monotherapy dose in protocol 093-045 or 
093-046, plus 1.  
c. For a subject who did not complete the 1- Year Open -Label Period, and did not 
add any non- rescue AED since the date of the first monotherapy dose in 
protocol 093-045 or 093-046, Time on Monotherapy during 1- Year Open -

Label Period is calculated as the date of the known dose before the withdrawal 
during 1- Year Ope n-Label Period , minus the date of the first monotherapy 
dose in protocol 093-045 or 093-046, plus 1. 
2. Seizure frequency  
Seizure frequency from the subject’s diary data will be evaluated by standardiz ing the 
sum of seizures to a frequency per 4 weeks (28 days).  The standardized seizure 
frequency  (SSF) for any given period (including baseline) will be calculated as:  
Total number of seizures reported in the diary during the  
interval of interest   x 28 days 
Number of days on study for the interval of inter est 
  
The number of days on study for the interval of interest will be determined by:
Visit Date of  last  visit during  the interval  of interest
−Visit Date of  first  visit during  the interval  of interest 
3. Relative change in seizure frequency  from baseline 
Seizure frequency change from the baseline period will be evaluated by using SSF per 
4 weeks (28 days).  The baseline period is the period from Visit 1 to Visit 2 from 
Protocols 093-045 or 093-046. The relative (%) change in SSF  for any interval of interest (including baseline) will be 
calculated as:  
(SSF during the interval of interest) –  
      (SSF during baseline period) x 100 
SSF during baseline period 
Further the relative change from baseline will be categorized into: 
 100% Decrease
 ≥ 75%  - < 100% Decrease 
 ≥ 50%  - < 75% Decrease 
 0% to < 50% Decrease  
 > 0%  to < 25% Increase  
 ≥25% to <50% increase 
 ≥50% to <100% increase 
 ≥100 % increase 
4. Responder rate  
Responder is defined as having a ≥50% reduction in SSF  from baseline.

The proportion will be calculated as the number of responders divided by the total 
number of subjects in the ITT population entering the period of interest.   
5.Seizure- free  
Subjects who did not have any seizure as per the seizure diary during that time period 
will be deemed seizu re free, for the corresponding interval of interest.  However, 
subjects who discontinue prior to Visit 7 will be considered not seizure- free for the 
interval when the discontinuation takes place and all subsequent intervals (even if the subjects are seizur e-free at the time of discontinuation) .  That is, subjects must 
complete each interval of interest  without any seizures to be considered seizure- free 
for each interval of interest. 
The number and percent of seizure- free subjects will be presented for the i nterval of 
interest, for each interval the percent will be based out of the number of subjects in 
the ITT population entering each interval of interest.   
6.Seizure frequency by seizure type  
SSF will be calculated by seizure type using the same methods described in  #2 of this 
section. 
7.Completion rates  
Study completion is defined as the proportion of subjects from the ITT population 
who completed the entire 1- Year Open -Label Period (Visit 1 to Visit 7 ). 
8.Treatment retention time (time to withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse 
events) .   
If a subject’s reason  for withdrawal from 1-Year Open -Label Period  included: 
withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, physician decision or other, then it will be 
assumed the subject terminated due to lack of efficacy . For subjects that discontinue 
due to adverse event or lack of efficacy, the t reatment retention time during the 1-
Year Open -Label Period will be calculated as the date of last known dose during the 
1-Year Open -Label Period  minus the date of the first dose of eslicarbazepine acetate 
monotherapy in protocol 093-045 or 093-046 ( Visit 6/Week 8) , plus 1.  T he time may 
include taking eslicarbazepine acetate concomitantly with other AEDs.   
5.2.3. Post-1-Year Open -Label Period Endpoints  
1. Patient Global Impression  
PGI measures the effect of study drug by assessing patient overall impression on a 5 -
point scale from 0 (best score) to 4 (worst score), including: 
• Very much improved 
• Improved

PGI will be summarized from Visit 8 every three months during the Post-1-Year 
Open-Label Period until the End of Study or Early Termination Visit.     
2 C ompletion rates  
Completion rates for Post- 1- Year Open -Label Period will be defined as the proportion 
of subjects from the ITT population who had the reason for withdrawal from the Post-
1 Year Open -Label Period either “Sponsor terminates clinical study” or “Study drug 
became available in subject’s  locale” from the end of study page in the CRF.  
3. Time on eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy  
 Time on eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy during Post1- Year Open -Label Period 
will be calculated from  the date of the first eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy  dose 
in protocol 093-045 or 093-046(Visit 6/Week 8) to the last known dose of eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy during Post -1-Year Open- Label Period  as 
follows; 
a. For a subject who added a non- rescue AED during Post-1- Year Open -Label 
Period, Time on Monotherapy during Post 1- Year Open -Label Period is 
calculated as the date of start a non -rescue AED during Post -1-Year Open -
Label Period minus the date of the first monotherapy dose in protocol 093-045 or 093-046.    
b. For a subject who completed the Post -1-Year Open -Label Period, and did not 
add any non-rescue AED since the date of the first monotherapy dose in protocol 093-045 or 093-046, Time on Monotherapy during Post -1-Year 
Open-Label Period is calculated as the date of the last known dose during 
Post-1-Year Open -Label Period, minus the date of the first monotherapy dose 
in protocol 093-045 or 093-046, plus 1.  
c. For a subject who did not complete the Post- 1Year Open -Label Period and did 
not add any non- rescue AED since the date of the first monotherapy dose in 
protocol 093-045 or 093-046, Time on Monotherapy during Post - 1-Year 
Open-Label Period is calculated as the date of the last known dose before the 
withdrawal during Post - 1-Year Open -Label Period, minus the date of the first 
monotherapy dose in proto col 093-045 or 093-046, plus 1. 
4.Treatment retention time  
If a subject’s reason for withdrawal from Post -1-Year Open -Label Period included: 
withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, physician decision or other, then it will be assumed the subject terminated  due to lack of efficacy. For subjects that discontinue 
due to adverse event or lack of efficacy, the treatment retention time during Post -1-
Year Open -Label Period will be calculated as the date of last known dose during Post-
1-Year Open -Label Period minus the date of the first dose of eslicarbazepine acetate 
monotherapy in protocol 093-045 or 093-046 (Visit 6/Week 8), plus 1.  The time may include taking eslicarbazepine acetate concomitantly with other AEDs.

5.2.4. Entire Open -Label  Period Endpoints  
1. Change in Quality of Life in Epilepsy  
The QOLIE -31 contains seven multi- item scales that assess the following health 
concepts:  emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, cognitive 
functioning, seizure worry, medication effects, and overall quality of life.  The 
QOLIE-31 overall score  is obtained by using a weighted average of the multi- item 
scale scores .  The QOLIE- 31 also includes a single item that assesses overall health  
on a visual analogue scale.  The recorded responses will be converted to 0 -100 point 
scales as described in Table 1 .   The mean of the individual item scores in each 
subgroup are then calculated, with higher converted scores reflecting better quality of life.  If one item within a scale score is missing, it will be replaced by the mean value 
of the other items .  If more than one item is missing, the scale score will not be 
calculated .   
The QOLIE -31 overall score is obtained by using a weighted average of the 7 scale 
scores according to the following formula: 
Overall score = Seizure  worry * 0.08 
   + Overall quality of life * 0.14 
+ Emotional well-being * 0.15 
   + Energy/fatigue * 0.12 
   + Cognitive functioning * 0.27    + Medication effects * 0.03    + Social functioning * 0.21 If no score has been calculated for at least one of the 7 scales, the overall QOLIE -31 
score will not be calculated.   The change from baseline to each post -treatment 
assessment in QOLIE-31 overall score will also be calculated.

• Apparent sadness 
• Reported sadness 
• Inner tension 
• Reduced sleep  
• Reduced appetite 
• Lassitude 
• Concentration difficulties
• Suicidal thoughts 
• Inability to feel 
• Pessimistic thoughts  
The total score is defined as the sum of all individual item scores .  If one item is 
missing at a  given visit, it will be replaced with the mean of the answers that are 
present.  If more than one item is missing at a given visit, no total score will be 
calculated .   
Change in MADRS total score will be summarized from Visit 2 (Day 0) of P rotocols 
093-045 or 093-046 (baseline)  to end of study treatment ( ET/EOS). This analysis will 
be repeated for subjects  with a MADRS score of ≥14 at screening visit (Visit 1) of the 
present study.   
5.3. Safety Assessments and Endpoints  
5.3.1. Safety Assessments 
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study, starting at Visit 1 .    
Clinical laboratory tests to be collected include:  serum chemistry, hematology, 
thyroid panel ( free T3, free T4, and TSH), coagulation testing (prothrombin time 
[PT]/international normalized ration [INR] and partial thromboplastin time [PTT]), lipid panel (total cholesterol, high -density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, low-density 
lipoprotein [LDL]-cholesterol, and triglycerides), bone turnover markers (serum  25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-OHD], parathyroid hormone [PTH], os teocalcin, 
bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and urinary N-telopeptides of type I collagen cross-links [NTx]), and urinalysis.   
A 12-lead ECG collect ventricular heart rate, QT interval, P -R interval, QRS 
durations, R-R interval, and the QTc intervals c orrected by Bazett (QTcB) and 
Fridericia (QTcF) .   
Vital signs includ e standing and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, standing 
and supine heart rate, respiration rate, weight, and body temperature.  
Physical and neurological examinations will b e conducted at Visit 1 and the End of 
Study or Early Termination Visit.

The C-SSRS is an instrument designed to systematically assess and track suicidal 
events (suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation) throughout the study.  The C- SSRS 
includes the following four sections: Suicidal Ideation, Intensity of Ideation , 
Suicidal Behavior and Actual Suicide Attempts.  The C-SSRS will be completed by 
the Investigator or Sub-Investigator (or qualified site personnel).   
5.3.2. Safety Endpoints  
Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), 
Version 13.1.   
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be defined as:  
• AEs that occurred on or after the first dose of study drug during this protocol,   
• AEs with a missing  start date and a stop date on or after the first dose of study 
drug during this protocol, or  
• AEs with both a missing start and stop date.   
Adverse events whose relationship is assessed as “not related” will be grouped as 
“unrelated.” Otherwise, adverse events assessed as “unlikely,” “possible,” “probable,” or “definite,” unknown or missing will be grouped as “potentially related.” Further, if a subject reports more than one AE within the same treatment regimen, system organ class (SOC) and preferred term  (PT), and any are related, it will be summarized as 
related.   
If a subject has more than one occurrence of an event within a SOC and/or PT, the subject incidence summaries will count each subject only once within that SOC and/or PT.  In the case of more than one event within a SOC and/or PT, the event with the 
highest severity will be summarized in the by -severity summaries and the one with the 
strongest relationship will be summarized in the by- relationship summaries.  
TEAEs will be sorted by SOC in alphabetical order and then by PT sorted by 
decreasing frequency, with preferred terms with the same frequency sorted in alphabetical order.  
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation    
Observed values and change from baseline will be summarized  for each visit, where 
change from baseline is the result of interest minus baseline value (Visit 2/Day 0 from 
protocol 093-045 or 093-046).  
Each laboratory result will be cross referenced with laboratory-provided normal 
reference ranges to determine whether the test result is below, within, or above the 
normal range.  Similarly, sponsor defined- potentially clinically significant (PCS) 
laboratory results will be identified using the criteria in Table 2.

            Observed values and change from baseline will be summarized  for each visit, where 
            change from baseline is the result of interest minus the baseline result (Visit 2 from  
            protocol 093- 045 or 093-046).   
            The number and percentage of subjects with QTc-F values in the following categories             will be identified:  
• QTc-F >500 ms at any postdose time point not present at baseline

• QTc-F >450 ms at any postdose time point not present at baseline  
• Change from baseline in QTc-F ≥60 ms for at least 1 postdose measurement  
• Change from baseline in QTc-F ≥30 ms for at least 1 postdose measurement, 
but <60 ms for all postdose measurements.       
            This categorical analysis will be also performed for QTc- B.  
 
         The incidence of specific ECG abnormalities will also be identified for the following            categories:  
• Overall abnormalities  
• Rhythm abnormalities  
• Conduction abnormalities 
• Morphology abnormalities 
• Myocardial infarction 
• Presence of ST Segment abnormalities  
• Presence of T wave abnormalities

Body Weights 
Observed weight values and change from baseline will be summarized for each visit, where change from  baseline is the weight at the visit of interest minus the baseline 
weight (Visit 2 from protocol 093-045 or 093-046). Subjects with a weight change of 
≥7% will be identified at each visit by dividing the change from baseline weight, by the baseline weight, and multiplying by 100.                 
 Orthostatic Effects  
The number and percentage of subjects who experienced orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia will be summarized . Orthostatic effects can be determined for a 
vital sign, by examining the difference between positions. 
(Standing result during the interval of interest)- (Supine result during the interval of 
interest) 
Orthostatic hypotension is having a difference of ≤ -20 mmHg in systolic or ≤ -10 
mmHg in diastolic blood pressure.  Orthostatic  tachycardia will be defined as a 
difference in heart rate ≥ 20 beats per minute and the standing heart rate >100  beats 
per minute  after the subject was standing for at least 2-4 minutes. 
Other Safety Assessments  
Physical and neurological examinations performed at Visit 1 of protocols 093-045 or 
093-046 will apply to Visits 1 (Screening) of the present study.   
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS)  
Occurrence of suicidal ideation is defined as having answered “yes” to at least one of the 5 suicidal ideation sub-categories (wish to be dead, non- specific active suicidal 
thoughts, active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan] without intent to act,

active suicidal ideation with some intent to act [without specific plan], and active 
suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) at any evaluation. Occurrence of suicidal behavior is defined as having answered “yes” to at least one of the 4 suicidal behavior sub- categories (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, and 
preparatory acts or behavior) at any post  baseline evaluation. Suicidal ideation is rated 
on a 6-po int scale from 0=’No ideation present’ to 5=’Active ideation with plan and 
intent’.  A score of 4 or 5 on this scale indicates serious suicidal ideation.   
Suicidality is defined as having at least one occurrence of suicidal ideation or at least one occurrence of suicidal behavior during the assessment period. 
Concomitant medications  
All medications will be coded using WHO Drug, version 01Jun2009. The number and 
percentage of subjects using each concomitant medication will be summarized according to the WHO DRUG Class and preferred term (PT).  Subjects with multiple 
uses of a concomitant medication will be counted once for a given WHO Drug Class 
and PT. Prior medications are defined as any medication with an end date before the 
first dose of study medication. Concomitant medications are  defined as medications 
present on or after the first dose of study medication.  
6. Statistical Methods  
6.1 General Methodology 
All statistical procedures will be performed using SAS Version 9.2 or higher. 
Continuous variables, including those assessed on a discrete scale, will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics, including the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75
th percentile, and maximum .  For 
categorical variables, summaries will include counts of subjects and percentages. 
Baseline   
Change in seizure related  efficacy parameters will be calculated with reference to the 
baseline period defined as the baseline period (From Visit 1 to  Visit 2) from protocol 
093-045 and 093-046.  T he change in QOLIE, MADRS and safety parameters will be 
calculated with reference to the baseline as Day 0 (Visit 2) for protocol 093-045 and 
093-046.  
3-month visit windows  
There are four 3 -month intervals for the 1-Year Open -Label Period .  The first window 
is defined as ≥Visit 1and <Visit 4 , the second window is ≥Visit 4 and <Visit 5, the 
third window is ≥Visit 5 and <Visit 6 and the fourth window is ≥Visit 6 and <Visit 7).  
This 3-month interval will used to summarize seizure related  efficacy data. 
6.2 Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
Subjects who dropped out before study completion are not to be replaced and all 
available information obtained from them will be included in the appropriate efficacy

and safety summaries to the time of dropout .  No imputation is planned for any safety 
measures.  
If the date of the seizure is missing or incomplete and the seizure cannot be allocated 
to a study interval, these data will not be used in the analysis, but will be presented in 
the subject data listings .  If the seizure diary was returned and there was no seizure 
data available for a particular day during that evaluation period, it will be assumed that the patient had missing seizure data, and the day will be excluded from the calculation of the standardized seizure frequency.   
Seizure related variables will be calculated based on available data.  For dropout subjects, their seizure frequency will be derived for each interval up to the last interval 
where the subject had data.  The last interval  standardized seizure frequency will be 
computed based on available data prior to dropout. 
For QOLIE31 and MADRS, if only one item is missing, it will be imputed by the 
average of other items for calculating the total score (See Section 5.2.4: 1 and 2).

7.3 Protocol Deviations 
Prior to database lock, important protocol deviations (IPDs) will be identified in a 
review of all protocol deviations reported.  Possible IPDs will include, but may not be limited to, subjects who:  
• Did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria or eligibility was not adequately verified  
• Received any disallowed concomitant medication during open- label treatment 
period  
• Developed withdrawal criteria but were not withdrawn  
The potentially important protocol deviations will be identified shortly before database lock, either programmatically ( e.g., inclusion/exclusion criteria violations) or through 
review of data listings ( e.g., investigator comments, concomitant medications) .  
Appropriate personnel (including, at a minimum, a medical director, and a biostatistician) will review the list of potential IPDs to identify which will be considered IPDs.  The final list of IPDs will be documented and used to generate a data listing .  The number and percentag e of subjects with IPDs will be summarized by 
the categories above.   
Listing of IPDs will be provided. In addition, subject inclusion and exclusion criteria

first dispensing date. If the day of last dose of study drug is unknown, then this will be 
set to the day of last contact. 
Extent of exposure will be summarized by the following mean daily dose categories: 
• ESL < 1000 mg  
• ESL 1000 mg – <1400 mg

dose level (mg) of ESL will be calculated as the total number of tablets taken within 
each treatment interval multiplied by the tablet strength, and then divided by the duration (in days) of treatment within the treatment interval. The overa ll mean daily 
dose will be calculated as the weighted average of the treatment intervals (i.e., the sum of the non- missing mean daily doses for each treatment interval multiplied by their 
respective number of days in the interval, divided by the total number of days in the

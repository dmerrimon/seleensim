Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 1 Clinical Trial Protocol  
1. Introduction  
Ninjamas Europe (NJ EU ) is an absorbent disposable single -use underwear pant developed for 
children suffering from nocturnal enuresis (nighttime bedwetting). The NJ EU absorbent 
underwear pant helps manage and contain urination gushes at night for up to 12 h ours. It is not 
intended to treat or cure nocturnal enuresis. It is a non -invasive device and intended for external 
application on intact skin. It is a simple non -active device (without electronics or batteries) that is 
very easy to use. No specific traini ng is required to use this product. It is available in 2 sizes: 
Size 7 for children aged 4 -7 (17-29 kg) and Size 8 for children aged 8 -12 years  (27-43kg).  
Since nocturnal enuresis in the age group 5 years and above  is considered a medical condition  
in Europe , this absorbent underwear pant is regulated as a Class 1 medical device in the EU. 
This clinical trial  will be part of the body of clinical evidence needed to support the Medical 
Device Report, which is required  to market this absorbent product as a nocturnal enuresis  
management tool for children age 4 -12 years in the EU.    
 
There are several ways to manage nocturnal enuresis in children . This clinical trial  will focus on 
the first option  only: 
 
• Absorbent underwear to manage urine loss without treating it.  
• Bed mats absorb urine and prevent the mattress from getting wet but do not keep  the 
child’s clothing and bed sheets  from getting wet.  
• Fluid and diet restriction  prior to bedtime . 
• Waking the child at specific times during the night  to go to the bathroom . 
• Bladder training or retention control training, where the child is trained to hold the urine 
as long as possible  in order to increase bladder capacity.   
• Rewards and star charts  to encourage nights without bedwetting . 
• Wetness alarms (bells or vibration s that wake the child when urinating ). 
• Desmopressin  (synthetic version of anti -diuretic hormone) . 
• Anticholinergic medic ine (e.g., Oxybutynin ) reduces the number of involuntary bladder 
contractions and has a relaxant effect on the smooth muscle of the bladder. This 
decreases the urge to pass urine and  allows the bladder to hold more urine.  
• Tricyclic drugs - work the same as Oxybutynin but are on ly used in case s where other 
drugs are not working. The need for close follow up and the potential for serious cardiac 
consequences with overdose mean they are considered for use in specialist cent ers 
only.  
• Psychological tre atment . 
 
The P&G company  has a 20+ year history of baby diaper clinical data (0 -36 months) to show that 
our diaper and pant technology is safe to use and effective for managing urine gushes in a baby 
and toddler population . The P&G company also has adult (18+ years) female incontinence 
products in the EU market , including absorbent heavy incontinence pants, that are classified as 
Class 1 Medical Devices, which were demonstrated to be safe to use and effectively manages 
urine gushes of adults  as seen in the statement of compliance from th e CER report  dated Feb 
2020  [1]. Since Aug 2020 t he P&G company markets  a similar Ninjamas night -time pant product 
in the USA for bedwetting children aged 4 -12 years. (Same age group and intended use as NJ EU 
product) and  P&G markets a training pant (BabyDry Pants S7) in the EU . Based on the P ost Market 
Safety Surveillance data of similar products in the EU und  US market (BabyDry Pants, FemCare 
AI Pants, NJ US pants ), we have reason to believe that the NJ EU product will have no safety

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 2 related issues when used as an overnight pant for children aged 4 -12 years, based on skin and 
health related AEs. [2]  
 
Although  the design of the P&G Adult Incontinence pull-up pants and the pull-up pants for babies 
and toddlers are  comparable to that of the NJ EU  Pull-up pant for bedwetting children , and there 
is a reason to believe that the NJ EU pull up  pant meet s all safety and product performance 
requirements , P&G currently has no  clinical evidence to support the  product safety and efficacy 
for the population of children aged 4-12 years . This clinical trial provides helpful technical data to 
bridge to the existin g body of evidence clinical data from adult and baby clinical trials  and gather 
clinical safety in -use data for this specific population of children, with a different gush volume than 
adults and babies and using the products only during night.  
 
Looking at the prevalence of nocturnal enuresis, this condition is more likely among younger 
children ( size 7 , or S7 , which is designed for children aged 4 -7) than older children (size 8 , or S8 , 
which is designed for children aged 8 -12). The graphs below show data from publications on 
nocturnal enuresis for UK [3] and USA [4] respectively.  
 
Figure 1 & 2: Prevalence of Nocturnal Enuresis for UK [1] and USA [2].  
 
 
 
This clinical trial  will therefore focus on the more representative S7 g roup. Reasons for choosing 
this group  include :  
 
1. This group will be easier to recruit with approximately 10-25% of the population 
suffering from nocturnal enuresis at age 4 -7, compared to only 1 -5% of the 
population at age 8 -12. In addition, the willingness of younger children to 
participate i n a bedwetting clinical trial  where the parent needs to do 
measurements in the pant area will be higher than for older children, who may 
not want the parent in the room when they remove their pant.  
 
2. Traditionally children are not considered for treatment of bedwetting un til age 7 . 
Over the age of 7 the  child is usually treated with drug  therapy t o reduce urine 
production at night.  
 
3. The S7 a nd S8 NJ EU pants  have the same design, with S8 ha ving a more 
abso rbent capacity and a bigger fit.   
 
4. P&G consumer s tudies (see tables below) show that there is no significant 
difference in nightly urine production comparing children in the S7 group vs . the 
S8 group. This means that the lower capacity S7 pant will be likely to be more 
wet than the S8 pant under the same load  conditions .

5. Younger children are more likely to wait for a parent to assist with d ressing and 
will therefore wear the wet pant longer than an older child , who is more likely to 
remove the pant themselves. Younger children also have a higher risk of feces  
on the skin (which is an irritant for the skin)  as they are not well -practiced in 
wiping themselves clean after visiting the toilet. Therefore, the S7 group has 
more risk of developing  rash from wet pants  than the S8 group, because their 
skin is wet longer and any feces rest ing on the skin can result in compromised 
skin and  rash in the pant area .    
 
Our focus will be on children with monosymptomatic enuresis  i.e., enuresis in children without any 
other lower urinary tract symptoms ( e.g., increased frequency, daytime incontinence, urgency, 
genital,  or lower urinary tract pain) and without a history of bladder dysfunction.  
 
This clinical trial  will accept children with both primary and secondary enuresis. Primary enuresis 
means the child has  never had a dry period at night . Secondary enuresis mean s the child 
developed nocturnal enures is after being dry for a period of at least six months.  
 
This clinical trial will be a 6 -week, in -home clinical trial to understand the safety, performance, 
and impact on skin of the NJ EU pant compared to the child’s currently used absorbent pant or 
diaper product.

The primary objective of this clinical trial is to confirm the in -use tolerability of the Ninjama EU 
overnight pant product , in the target population of bedwetters  aged 4 -7 years , based on a body 
of evidence from clinical assessments of skin, adverse events and parent/child perception data . 
This data will be part of the clinical evidence in  the Clinical Evaluation Report needed to market 
this product as a Class 1 Medical Device in the EU , confirming that the product is safe to use and 
performs within its intended purpose . 
 
The secondary objective is to understand the clinical benefit of the NJ EU overnight pant product  
in a bedwetting population aged 4 -7 years, based on quality of life, healthy skin and  waking up in 
a dry bed, via collecting H&P and parent/child perception data in diaries and end -of-use 
questionnaires.  
 
The learnings from this clinical trial will be used as supporting data for potential claims . 
 
3. Investigational Plan  
3.1 Clinical Trial Desig n 
This will be a single center, single blinded  (sponsor’s team will be blinded to the product codes) , 
randomized, cross -over, IRB-Approved, in-home clinical test design over 6 weeks, with two usage 
periods of 3 weeks each. During one period the child will maintain usage of their usual absorbent 
night p ant/diaper  and during the other usage period they will use the NJ EU  absorbent pant. We 
will track habits and practices that may impact skin health and product performance as well as 
medication use and Adverse Events/ Adverse Device Effects  (AEs /ADEs ). Children will be asked 
to wear either their own pants or the test pants exclusively at night and parent/legal guardian  will 
be asked to collect  data in the evening before bed and in the mornings after getti ng up .   
 
Parent /Legal Guardian  will be trained to execute the measurements on their own child for the   
following reasons : 
 
1. Children this age are usually told not to let strangers touch them in the genital and 
buttock area, so we want to avoid telling kids it is OK in this case. We will ensure that the 
child is comfortable to participate in this clinical trial and can at any ti me end the ir 
participation in this clinical  trial should  they feel uncomfortable.  
 
2. Due to COVID restrictions , clinical trial  person nel should minimize  close contact with  
panelists as much as possible, especially with children under 5 years of age , who can not 
be vaccinated. We will therefore ask the trained parent /legal guardian  to do the 
measurements on his/her own child/ren. Children can stop the study procedures at any 
time if/when they feel uncomfortable.  
This clinical trial is designed to track the following:  
• general safety (AEs and ADEs),  
• assess skin properties in the pant area (parental assessment of skin wetness, rash, 
pressure marks , pH and Trans Epidermal Water Loss  (TEWL)  and child perception of skin 
irritation and wetness  
• assess fit and performance  of the overnight pant products  (fit images , leaks, product 
defects )

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 5 • Quality  of Life ( QoL) information of parent/legal guardian and child after each product 
usage period.  
             The following table shows which endpoints will be measured at which time and where on the child:

• Leaking and Pant Fit: Mobile phone images of the pant on the child will be collected by the 
parent/legal guardian at home using their mobile device and the MyBabySkin  app. Expert 
graders will evaluate pant fit from these collected images.  
 
• Child Perception: Child will be asked simple yes/ no questions to determine if they feel 
irritation or wetness . If yes, the parent/legal guardian will ask the child to point to location 
where they feel the irritation or wetness . 
 
• Parental Skin Perception : Parent/ legal guardian  will be trained to assess rash, skin 
pressure marks and skin wetness  in the pant area . 
 
• Skin barrier integrity will be measured by trained parent/legal guardian who will be asked 
to measure the child’s skin pH and TEWL values in pant area using provided portable pH 
and gpskin devices. TEWL and pH are generally taken at several points in the pant area  in 
to determine conditions over the entire  area of the pant. The supra -pubic area is expected 
to be exposed to more wetness, as this site is closest to the urination point. However, when 
the children sleep on the ir back, the urine runs to the back and the buttocks can become 
wet. So, it will be ve ry important to determine the sleep position of the kids and measure 
skin barrier integrity of front and back areas . 
 
Up to 30 children (approximate  split of 15  males  and 15 females) who meet inclusion /exclusion  
criteria will be enrolled  in the clinical tr ial. S7 children  will be enrolled in this clinical trial  because 
nocturnal enuresis is most prevalen t in children aged 4 -7 and the pant design for S7 and S8 
products are similar. Therefore , the data generated for the S7 population can be used to support 
the S8 population . Children  for this clinical trial  will be  enrolled by North  Cliff Consultants  in 
Cincinnati, USA .  Eligible subjects  will be bedwetters who have wet the bed at least once a week 
or more  over the past 3 months . The c hildren should  be accustomed  to wear ing an absorbent pant 
product overnight . They will be asked to use the ir own overnight pant every night for 3 weeks of 
the clinical trial  and will be asked to use the NJ EU  test pant every night for the other  3 weeks of

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 6 be asked to refrain from using wet wipes to clean the child’s skin for the duration of the clinical trial  
(no test wipes will be provided) . 
If a subject drops out of the clinical trial , they will not be replaced, due to the short duration of the 
clinical trial . 
 
Once  qualified , parent /legal guardian  will be asked to pick up the equipment (pH meter  set, gpskin  
device , scale,  and selfie light)  from North  Cliff Consultants .  They will receive training on how to 
handle the equipment and how to complete the questionnaires . Parent/legal guardian  will be 
required to begin with the clinical trial  after the training session . They will be given 2 days to practice 
with the instruments and MyBabySkin  app before data is officially collected for the clinical trial.  
 
Parent /legal guardian  will be instructed  to complete a digital questionnaire  twice  daily (once in the 
morning  befor e removing the used pant and once in the evening  when applying the fresh pant) via 
MyBabySkin  app. This will include taking four photos  of the child wearing the pant (front , back and 
both hips) and measuring pH and gpskin  values in four areas ( upper thigh, hip, suprapubic area , 
and central buttock area) . It includes capturing adverse events and compliance questions. 
Subjects  will also be asked to complete a H&P  questionnaire at the clinical trial  start and at the 
end of each 3-week period and they will also be asked to complete an after-use questionnaire.    
 
This clinical trial  will be submitted for IRB/ethics review .  
 
3.2 Clinical Trial Procedure s 
 
3.2.1 Visit  1 – Enrollment  and Training (on Site)  
 
1. On the day of their appointment , a parent /legal guardian  will be asked to come to 
the clinical site together with their participating child.  
 
2. Parent/legal guardian  will be instructed  to read the Informed Consent document 
but not si gn until they meet with clinical personne l. They will be given the 
oppo rtunity to have any questions answered.  They will be asked to sign two 
copies of the Informed Consent in the presence of clinical personnel . After 
verification of a legible signature,  the parent/ legal guardian will be instructed to 
keep one signed copy of the Informed Consent.  The c linical site will keep the 
other copy.  
 
3. Parent/legal guardian will be asked for demographic information  and inclusion/  
exclusion criteria to determine if their child is eligible to participate in the clinical 
trial.  Children will be weighed on a bathroom scale  and have their body length , 
waist circumference  (lying down and standing) , thigh circumference and hip 
circumfere nce measured by the parent  under the supervision of a clinical staff 
member. The participating c hild must be present, so clinical personnel  can verify 
the age , weight, Fitzpat rick scale and general health of the child. The child will 
also be asked to try o n one of the overnight test pants to ensure proper fit. If 
eligible , parent/legal guardian will be asked about the typical habits and practice s 
of their child during  the My BabySkin app registration  (see Attachment C) . 
 
4. The subjects  will be asked to bring along a packet of their current ly used overnight 
pant product so the test site can verify that this product brand qualifies as one of 
the allowed “own product brands” (current marketed disposable or reusable 
absorbent overnight pant s/diapers or training pants/diapers). The brand name 
and lot code of this product will be documented.

1. Parent/legal guardian will be asked to complete the questionnaire 2x daily for 45 
days .  
- Once in the evening when applying the fresh night  pant 
- Once in the morning when removing the used pant  
 
2. In the evenings they will be asked to apply a fresh pant and wait ~15 minutes, 
before doing images, measurements , and skin assessments. In the mornings, 
they will be asked to take the images before they remove the pant and then 
remove the pant to do skin a ssessments. Approx. 5 minutes after removing the 
pant, they will be instructed to take the pH and gpskin measurements .  
 
3. The MyBabySkin  app will lead them step -by-step through the skin and pant 
assessment process and  the questionnaire has several questions  to check 
compliance and ADEs and AEs  throughout the clinical trial . It also has a chat 
function through which the parent /legal guardian  can provide feedback and ask 
questions  to the clinical site or sponsor . 
 
4. Parent/ legal guardian will be asked to measure skin pH and TEWL,  assess skin 
wetness,  rash, and pressure marks , enter pant wear time and weight, assess 
leaking , and take images of the pant fit on the child  in standing position . If the 
overnight pant did l eak, they will be asked to take an image of the wet stain on 
the p ajama pant  in the crotch area as well as front, back or sides in  a standing  
position , so we can see the location and size of the leak.  
 
5. To dimension the size of the stain, they will be a sked to put a provided sticker 
with known diameter on the p ajama pant. For determining the level of gapping 
and sagging of the overnight pant , the parent/legal guardian will make a mark  5 
cm above the navel with a surgical marker and at the same height at t he sides 
and back to determine how much the pant sagged overnight. A provided sticker 
with known diameter will be applied to the pant to determine the amount of 
sagging that occurred .  
 
6. Parents/legal guardian will be asked to calibrate the pH meter and gpskin device 
once a week to ensure it is working properly. The  test site will calibrate the 
instruments on the day they are handed out to the parent /legal guardian  and 
train them how to do the calibration. They will be asked to document the 
calibration  once a week In the MyBabySkin App .  
 
7. Subjects will receive two pH meters at the start of the clinical trial. The parent/ 
legal guardian will be instructed to use only one of the pH m eters for the study. I f 
this pH meter gets broken, cracked or is not calibrating anymore, the 
parent/legal guardian will be instructed to use the backup pH meter provided to 
them. Should this occur, the parent/legal guardian should inform the study site 
via a comment in the MyBabySkin app or via email. In case the gpskin device 
should be broken or defective, they will be asked to contact the study site to 
arrange for a replacement device asap .   
 
8. The parent/ legal guardian will be called via phone or video c hat after the 2 
practice days to provide  feedback after monitoring their data. Throughout the 
Clinical Investigational Plan  CSD2021096  Confidential                                          Final Version

at least once per week (either during planned study visits or remote phone /video  
calls) so the study site can give feedback,  check on progress , track lot codes of 
new purchased products  and answer questions  throughout the clinical trial . 
Feedback from subjects who participated i n similar studies was that for remote 
studies it is very important for the study site to have regular contact with the 
subjects and receive  feedback (positive and negative) on their progress. They 
appreciate know ing that they are doing  the measurements and  images correctly

The TEWL and Stratum Corneum Hydration (SCH) measurements will be taken with a gpskin  
Barrier Pro device from gpower Inc. of Korea. The child will be standing up while 
measurements are taken. These measurements will be taken for 10 seconds with data being 
displayed  on the Smartphone app to give a mean TEWL value (g/m2/hr) and a mean SCH 
value (arbitrary units). The values will be recorded in the MyBabySkin app. Measurements will 
be taken at the thigh ( uncovered control), hip, supra pubis  (genital)  and central  buttocks. 
Reference diagram s in the Attachment .  
Measurements will be taken by a parent /legal guardian  who has been trained to properly use 
the device .   
 
The serial number of the gpskin  device used in this clinical trial  will be recorded in the clinical 
trial records.   
 
Parents/legal guardians will be asked to calibrate the devices once a week and report the 
calibration in the MyBabySkin app . 
 
3.7.4  Pant  Weight/Wear Time  (Attachment  N) 
Pant weight will be measured on a kitchen scale after pant removal . Pant wear time will  be 
recorded  in the mornings .  Both measurements will be recorded in the MyBabySkin  app.  
 
3.7.5  pH Measure ments  (Attachment  L) 
Skin pH measurements will be taken by a trained parent/legal guardian using a portable 
Hanna Skin pH meter . The child will be standing up while measurements are taken. 
These measurements will be recorded in the MyBabySkin app. pH measurements will 
be taken at the thigh ( uncovered skin  control), hip, supra pubis and central  buttocks.  
Parents/legal guardians will be asked to calibrate the devices once a week and report the 
calibration in the MyBabySkin app . 
 
3.7.6  Photos  (Attachment  E, F & G) 
Photo images will be taken by parent /legal guardian  to collect images of the pant fit using the 
MyBabySkin  app on their mobile phone . A skin mark will be made 5 cm above the center of 
the navel  and skin marks will be made at the same height on the back and at the sides (above 
hips).  The child will be asked to stand up with legs slightly apa rt (front and back images) and  
using the provided illuminated selfie light.  For the hip images the child will stand upright and 
will bend the leg closest to the camera at a 90° angle, so one can see if there are gaps at the 
leg cuffs.   
 
Parent/legal guardi an will also be asked to take an image of wet stains in the pajama pant, so 
we can determine where the leak happened and how big the stain was. Images should be 
taken of the pant on the child in the crotch area, front, back or sides, depending on where the  
stain is.  
 
Photos will be stored without personally identifiable information and in such a manner as to 
restrict access through password protection.  For example, the mobile phone used to take the 
photos will not store the photos on the photo roll or clou d, but they will be stored inside the 
password protected app. Parent/legal guardian will submit photos at the end of each 
questionnaire into a limited -access P&G  database via encoded transfer. The folder used to

(e.g., worn the wrong way) , product defects, pant sagging and pant gapping .   
 
3.7.7  Twice Daily  Questionnaire  in MyBabySkin App (Attachment  D) 
Parent/legal guardian will be asked questions twice daily (once in the morning when removing 
the night pant and once in the evening  when applying the fresh night pant) regarding their 
perception of the skin wetness and  their perception of skin rash/pressure marks . They will be 
asked to take photos, collect pH and gpskin  data and answer questions about the child’s H&P 
and overall health. The questions will be asked via the MyBabySkin  app that parents will use 
at home to collect data on their mobile device . 
 
3.7.8  Skin Irritation Perception  
Child will be asked their perception of skin irritation  by picking one of the  following options. If 
they pick an option, the y will be asked where the y feel the irritation.  
• Nothing  
• Skin is burning /stinging  
• Skin is itching/ tingling  
• Skin is feeling warm/hot  
 
 
4. Statistical Methods   
4.1 Statistical Analysis  
All statistical analyses will be the responsibility of the Sponsor.   A separate statistical analysis plan 
is in Attachment B.  
  
4.2 Determination of Sample Size

Each subject’s parent /legal guardian must sign and date an Informed Consent to allow their child 
to participate in the clinical trial . Each parent/legal guardian will be given the opportunity to have 
his/her questions answered to their satisfaction. Without this signed document, a child will be 
ineligible to participate in this clinical trial .  
 
This consent form will comply with all applicable regulations governing the protection of human 
subjects. The elements of Informed Consent and the documentation of Informed Consent are 
specified in ICH GCPs chapter 4. A signed copy of the Informed Consent will be kept by the 
parent/legal guardian of the child and the Investigator will retain a signed copy  
 
Subjects may withdraw f rom participation in the clinical trial  at any time. Additionally, the 
Investigator may remove subjects from the clinical trial  if it is in the best interest of the subjects. 
The reason for all Investigator removals from the clinical trial  will be document ed. 
 
 7.4 Data Collection  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that data are collected and reported 
according to the clinical trial  protocol.  
 
Data Collection System  
A newly developed tool, MyBabySkin  app, will be the primary tool used for data collection.  This 
app was developed by an outside vendor (Vertex).  
 
Additionally, the Electronic Case Report Forms (ECRF) data capture system, a database 
developed through a validated, Electronic Records/Electroni c Signatures (ERES) -compliant 
Clinical Investigational Plan  CSD2021096  Confidential                                          Final Version   
 
 
Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 17 platform (21 CFR Part 11)  will be utilized to collect data by the site (e.g.,  Demographics, 
Inclusion/Exclusion, Anthropometry, Adverse Events, Medications, General Comments, and 
Subject Accountability).  
 
All protocol specified data included in the clinical trial  database will be collected as e -source.  
 
7.4.1 Source Documents  
 
Direct data entry will be used  via the MyBabySkin  app and ECRF.  T he electronic records 
are considered to be source documents.  
 
There will be periodic monitoring of the site on the critical enrollment days and the study 
conduct via remote data reviews.  Data entered by the parents through the MyBabySkin  
app will be monitored periodically to chec k for compliance via remote monitoring.  
 
7.5  Adverse Events  or Adverse Device Effects  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable and unexpected medical occurrence in a 
subject.  An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is defined as any AE related to the use of the 
investigational medical device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, any malfunction, use error or intentional misuse of the medical 
device. Each day  (following the initial visit), the parent/ legal guardian will be asked if there has 
been any change in the child’s health (illness or injury) since the previous visit  or the previous time 
the questionnaire was filled in . Changes in health will be documented a s an AE or ADE as 
appropriate, regardless of the causality relationship with product use. All AEs and ADEs will be 
followed to resolution.  
 
7.5.1  Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect Reporting  
In the MyBabySkin  app, the parent /legal guardian will be asked twice daily about their 
child’s health and medication intake.   Based on the information provided, Sponsor and 
PI will determine if it is appropriate to record as an Adverse Event or Adverse Device 
Effect and will contact the p arent /legal guardian  for more  information. Such an 
occurrence does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with product use. 
Due to the nature of this clinical trial , skin irritation in the pant area (diaper rash)  will not 
be documented as an Adverse Event or Adverse Device Effect given it is one of the 
end point s of interest for the clinical trial . However, if a skin reaction occurs in the pant 
area which causes the parent /legal guardian  to seek medical attention,  outside the 
normal follow -up given to the child within the clinical trial , this will be documented and 
followed in the same manner as other Adverse Events  or Adverse Device Effects .  
The Investigator or designee will review each Adverse Event Report and c omplete the 
form based on the following decision charts : 
Chart 1: Categories of ADE and AEs

Chart 2: AE categorization flow chart  
 
The Investigator or designee will review each Adverse Event Report and complete the 
form based on the following  definitions:  
 
  Severity : 
o Mild - normal activities unaltered, AE or ADE is annoying, but tolerable  
o Moderate - normal activities altered or AE or ADE requires intervention  
o Severe - unable to undertake normal activities or is incapacitated  
 
  Investigator's Opinion of Causality : 
o Not Related - there is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE or ADE may be  
related to product usage  
o Doubtful – there is no medical evidence to suggest that the AE or ADE may be related 
to product usage, or there is  another more probable medical explanation

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 19 o Possible - there is possible evidence to suggest that the AE or ADE could possibly be 
related to product usage  
o Probable - there is probable evidence to suggest that the AE or ADE is probably related 
to product usa ge 
 
  Action Taken by Investigator : 
o None - no change in product usage  
o Reduced/Interrupted - product usage reduced or temporarily interrupted  
o Discontinued - product usage discontinued.  
 
Note:  Actions taken by parent/guardian may be documented in General Comments.  
 
The Investigator will decide on a case -by-case basis as to whether any subject should 
be dropped from the clinical trial . If the Investigator(s) or subject decides to discontinue 
clinical trial  participation, this should be documented an d filed with the Sponsor within 
72 hours. All adverse events and adverse device effects  will be followed until resolution 
or until the Investigator deems it safe to discharge the subject.   
 
7.5.2 Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events  or Adverse Device Effe cts Reporting  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) is defined 
as any unexpected medical occurrence that at any exposure:  
 
1. Results in death  
2. Is life -threatening  
3. Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing  hospitalization  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. Requires medical or surgical intervention (devices)  
7. Is medically significant  
 
All SAEs and SADEs will be recorded on the written and/or electronic SAE or SADE 
form and tracked in this clinical trial . 
 
The Investigator/Designee must contact the Sponsor within 24 hours to discuss 
potentially serious or unexpected AEs. During normal business hours:  Susan na Brink

7.6  Device Def iciency Reporting  
Device deficiency is defined as the inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, 
quality, durability, reliability, suability, safety , or performance. Device deficiencies include 
malfunctions, use errors, and inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer including 
labelling.  In this clinical trial we will document any product or material defects, potential wrong 
application (via pant fit images), leaking /failure of ove rnight absorbent pants and all AEs /ADEs.   
 
All device deficiencies of the investigational products will be documented throughout the clinical 
trial and managed by the sponsor in accordance with written procedures  for the control of a non -
conforming produ ct. The sponsor shall take, where applicable, and appropriate , and corrective 
actions to protect the safety of subjects, users, and other persons. Device deficiencies of the 
comparator, if applicable, shall be documented.

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 20 Device deficiencies that did not lead to an adverse event, but could have led to a serious adv erse 
device effect : 
 
1. if either suitable action had not been taken  
2. if intervention had not been made, or  
3. if circumstances had been less fortunate  
 
shall be reported to the sponsor, who will prepare the needed Clinical Evaluation Report 
documentation and report the potential risk to the EC/IRB and national authorities as applicable. 
The sponsor will decide whether the risk analysis needs to be updated and assess whether 
preventative or corrective action is required.    
 
7.7 Investigator’s Final Report  
The Investigator will provide a Final Report within approximately 30 days from the completion of 
the in -life phase of the clinical trial . The report will consist of a description of the conduct of the 
clinical trial  including subject enrollmen t, subject demographics, protocol deviations, subject 
dropouts, and a discussion of AEs. Data analyses or data interpretation, if any, may be included 
in a separate document.  
 
7.8  Records Retention  
The Investigator(s) must retain the subject identificatio n codes, Informed Consent documentation, 
CRFs, medical records, and other source data for a minimum of 2 years after clinical trial  
completion. The Investigator(s) must receive written authorization from the Sponsor before 
destroying any clinical trial  document.  
 
The Investigator(s) will make the records available for inspection and copying upon the request of 
an authorized employee of a government authority or the Sponsor, at reasonable times.  
 
In the event the Investigator(s) retires, relocates, or for an y other reason withdraws from the 
responsibility for maintaining records for the period of time required, custody of the records may 
be transferred to another person who will accept responsibility for the records. Notice of such a 
transfer must be given in  writing to the Sponsor.  
 
The sponsor will maintain clinical records according to P&G Records Management Guidelines.  
 
7.9  Publications  
All data collected during this clinical trial  is the sole responsibility of the Sponsor. No publication 
by the site or any of the non -employee s of the sponsor is allowed from the results of this clinical 
trial. The Sponsor reserves the right to withhold consent for publications due to the confidentia l 
nature of the data. Subjects will be identified only by the assigned four -digit code and no identifiable 
personal information will be included.  
 
8. Sponsor Clinical Trial Management  
8.1 Data Quality Assurance  
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and reliability 
of the data:

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 21 • Data management quality control checks, and  
• Statistical quality control checks.  
 
In addition, a representative from the Sponsor may conduct periodic audits of clinical trial  
processes, including, but not limited to, a review of the Investigator’s Trial Master File (TMF), 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) pertaining to the clinical trial , and training records of staff 
involved.  
 
 
8.1.1 Monitoring  
Prior to the commencement of the clinical trial , an initiation meeting will be held with 
the appropriate clinical trial  site personnel to review the objectives and procedures of 
the clinical trial  and any other training needs associated with the clinical trial  and 
protocol execution.  
 
This clinical trial  will be monitored by Sponsor representatives at all stages of conduct 
from inception to conclusion in accordance with and ICH GCPs chapter 5.  
 
8.2  Clinical Trial Termination  
The clinical trial  will be terminated  upon completion of all subject treatments and evaluation. The 
Sponsor may discontinue the clinical trial  at any time.  In any case where this happens, the Principal 
Investigator and/or designee will return all clinical trial  supplies, and equipme nt to the Sponsor. In 
addition, all data which has been collected up to that point will be turned over to the Sponsor at 
that time.  
 
8.3 Sponsor’s Final Report  
A final report will be prepared by the Sponsor at the conclusion of this clinical trial . The Spo nsor’s 
final clinical trial  report will summarize the method, data,  and conclusions. Source data may be

Risk Assessment  
 
Product Safety  
 
No safety issues are anticipated with this clinical trial  as outlined.  Childr en participating in this clinical trial are using  
marketed  products  or products that are close to being  marketed . From products purchased on the market, we can 
assume that they have been tested and evaluated for their safety  in daily use.  Children will be asked to use these 
products as int ended.  
 
For the NJ EU test products, a full risk assessment  according to the ISO 14971 standard is being conducted and will 
be summarized  in a separate document before the start of the clinical trial .  
 
 
The P&G company has a 20+ year history of baby diaper clinical data (0 -36 months) to show that our diaper and 
pant technology is safe to use and effective for managing urine gushes in a baby and toddler population. The P&G 
company also has adult (18+ years ) female incontinence products in the EU market, including absorbent heavy 
incontinence pants, that are classified as Class 1 Medical Devices, which were demonstrated to be safe to use and 
effectively manages urine gushes of adults as seen in the statement  of compliance from the CER report dated Feb 
2020 [1]. Since Aug 2020 the P&G company markets a similar Ninjamas night -time pant product in the USA for 
bedwetting children aged 4 -12 years. (Same age group and intended use as NJ EU product) and  P&G markets a 
training pant (BabyDry Pants S7) in the EU. Based on the Post Market Safety Surveillance data of similar products 
in the EU und US market (BabyDry Pants, FemCare AI Pants, NJ US pants ), we have reason to believe that the NJ 
EU product will have no safety  related issues when used as an overnight pant for children aged 4 -12 years, based 
on skin and health related AEs. [2]  
 
 
Based on our current knowledge about th is product  and similar marketed products , we conclude the following  
statement, which will be up dated based on the outcome of this clinical trial : 
 
Statement of Compliance for Children’s Nocturnal Enuresis Devices  
It is understood that similarity between intended use and indications for use exists between the Procter & 
Gamble Children’s Nocturnal Enu resis Devices and competitor products. Such devices serve as 
morphotypes. Procter & Gamble Children’s Nocturnal Enuresis Devices when used under the conditions and 
for the purposes intended, will not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patie nts, or the safety 
and health of users or, where applicable other persons. The benefit of Procter & Gamble Children’s Nocturnal 
Enuresis Devices outweighs the risks associated with the product.  
 
Clinical risk identified in risk management has been adequat ely addressed for use in this clinical trial. This 
risk associated with the product is very minimal compared to the benefits of the product. Clinical investigation 
performed on similar Procter & Gamble pull-up pants identified no serious adverse events and no 
withdrawals due to adverse events. Procter and Gamble pull-up pants were well tolerated by the subjects 
with no product -related adverse events.  
 
Procter & Gamble Children’s Nocturn al Enuresis Devices are very simple devices  and easy to use. No 
specific training is required to use this product. There is full consistency between current knowledge/ the 
state of the art, the available clinical data, the information materials supplied by  the manufacturer, and the 
risk management documentation for Procter & Gamble Adult Children’s Nocturnal Enuresis Devices.  
 
  
As with any absorbent pant or diaper, it is possible in exceptional cases that these products may cause skin 
reactions like rednes s, blisters,  or sores. These skin reactions are usually temporary and usually need  no medical 
treatment, nor are they dangerous to the health. The risk of allergies cannot be totally excluded but can be 
considered very unlikely for these products. For subjects in this clinical trial , we do not expect any further risks 
apart from potential skin reactions (like redness). In case your child has some skin reactions (redness, swelling or 
blisters) during this test  that concerns you , please contact the clinical t rial personnel .

For the twice daily questionnaire, the parent/legal guardian will be asked to touch the child's skin in the pant area. 
Parent/legal guardian will be instructed to wash their hands before and after for hygienic reasons.   
 
The selfie light should only be use d to assist parent/legal guardian when taking images.  When using selfie lights, 
parent/legal guardian are instructed not to shine the light in the eyes of babies and pets.  
 
Parent/legal guardian will be asked to use a pH meter to measure skin pH and a gps kin device to measure skin 
hydration. The pH meter is made of glass and can break. Parent/legal guardian will be asked to take precautions 
when using the instrument to avoid the risk of glass breakage and not to use a broken device .  
 
Parent/legal guardian  will receive training on how to use th ese measuring  devices  correctly. They will be asked to  
ensure all instruments are switched off when not in use. These devices are not toys  and should only be handled by 
an adult . Parent/legal guardian will be reminded  to keep these devices out of the reach of children and pets. In 
addition, the associated chemicals (storage solution and buffer solutions) should be kept in a safe place. These 
solutions are not dangerous when swallowed.   
 
In case the instruments get contaminated or dirty , parent should  wipe with a provided alcohol wipe . They should not 
immerse any devices in water or rinse under running water.  Parent/legal guardian will be instructed to disinfect all 
devices after use with an alcohol w ipe to prevent bacterial growth.

Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Study Populations  
The Intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects who experienced the application of the 
assigned study product. The Per Protocol (PP) population includes subjects in the ITT population who 
have no serious inclusion/exclusion violations, no s erious continuance criteria violations, no serious 
concomitant medication violations, and high study product compliance. The ITT population will be used 
for the safety  analysis. Analyses of the Per Protocol population will be done to better understand the 
data.  
  
Prior to the statistical analysis, all data will be checked for accuracy, completeness, and compliance to 
the study protocol. Subject evaluations will be checked for compliance to the study protocol regimen and 
subjects will be assessed for compliance to the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Additionally, 
investigator comments will be assessed for extraneous factors that could affect the usefulness of the 
subject’s data.  Non -evaluable observations and the rat ionale, along with the method for handling the 
observations will be documented by the sponsor prior to analysis of the data.  
 
Period and carryover effects will be evaluated for potential influence on the results.  Means will be plotted 
by periods to under stand these effects.  
  
Summary descriptive statistics will be provided for all parameters. Ninety -five percent confidence 
intervals (CIs) will be constructed for all clinical assessments for each treatment code. Any data reported 
as ‘unable to evaluate’ wi ll be treated as missing and excluded from the analysis.  
 
The methods used for the analysis will include but not be limited to a variety of parametric and non -
parametric statistical methods based on the distribution/characterization of the data.  
 
The follo wing endpoints will be investigated.  
 
General Safety:  
 
1. ADE (adverse device effect) and AE (adverse event) tracking twice daily via a safety in -
use diary. We will list a summary of the product related ADE and AEs for both treatment 
periods and  the PI, Sub -PI, Statistician and Clinical Scientist will make a recommendation 
whether the product safety of Ninjamas is comparable to current product based on the 
medical and clinical evidence of the reported AE and ADE data.   
Product Fit and Performance:  
 
2. Product performance in terms of urine leaking (yes/no). We will calculate the p ercentage 
of leaks from loaded pants only. When comparing both products, Ninjama EU option 
should not be more than 2%  worse than current product).   
 
3. Product or material defects that can lead to product failure or safety risks. All product 
defects will be summarized and categorized as potential reason for product failure (leaks) 
or safety risk .   
 
4. Pant fit images will be investigated by an expert grader to identify any application  errors 
(e.g., applied wrong way) and to see how well the overnight pant (wet or dry) is staying in

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 25 place. We will identify if sagging or gapping of the pant  led to leaking or if a bad fit led to 
skin irritation or severe pressure marking .  
 
5. Images of the  wet stain on the overnight pajama pant will help identify the size of the stain 
and where the pant was leaking. This will be compared with the pant fit images.   
 
Skin Health  
 
6. Parental skin rash perception (none/mild/moderate/severe) . We will calculate the 
cumulative  number  of moderate and severe  scores on a weekly basis. When comparing 
both products, the Ninjama EU option should not be more than 2% worse than current 
product on moderate and severe scores. W e expect to see carry -over effects in week one 
of each usage period . 
 
7. Parental overall skin health condition (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor). We will 
calculate the cumulative number  of fair and poor scores on a weekly basis. When 
comparing both pr oducts, the Ninjama EU option should not be more than 2% worse than 
current product on fair and poor scores. We expect to see carry -over effects in week one 
of each usage period.  
 
8. Skin barrier integrity, via skin pH and TEWL m easurements taken by trained parent 
before overnight pant application and 5 minutes after overnight pant removal (Thigh, hip, 
sura-pubic, buttock). Each site will be investigated separately. We will plot  individual pH 
and TEWL graphs over time and calculate the weekly average  for each panelist. We 
expect to see carry over effects in week 1 of each period.  
 
9. Parental skin dryness perception (acceptable wetness / not acceptable wetness). We will 
calculate the p ercentage of unacceptable wetness scores from loaded pants. When 
compa ring both products, Ninjama EU option should not be more than 2% worse than 
current product).  
 
10. Skin irritation perception from child (burning/itching/ stinging/tingling/feeling of heat). We 
will calculate the cumulative number  of skin irritation scores on a weekly basis. When 
comparing both products, Ninjama EU option should not be more than 2% worse than 
current product on moderate and severe scores. We expect to see carry -over effects in 
week 1 of each usage period . 
 
11. Parental pressure mark perception on skin (none/mild/ moderate/ severe). We expect the 
belt design of the NJ EU pant to have more pressure marks than other overnight pants to 
ensure a better fit. We will calculate the cumulative number  of severe pressure mark 
scores over 3 weeks . When comparing both products, Ninjama EU option should not be 
more than 2% worse than current product in terms of severe pressure marks).  
 
Quality of Life  
 
12. Use QoL measures at the end of each usage period for potential claims. QoL data will be

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 26 Protocol Amendment I  
CSD2021096/ NCCI #12 -2103  
OVERNIGHT PANT SAFETY -IN-USE DIARY CLINICAL TRIAL FOR CHILDREN WITH NOCTERNAL 
ENURESIS  
 
Rationale for amendment : 
1. Correction of mistake in exclusion criteria. List of medication examples are mentioned in EXCL 2, but 
should be listed in EXCL 3.   
2. Clarification of blinding of sponsor. Blinding of the sponsor representatives w ill be very difficult, due to 
the diary question about what product they used and the photos. Therefore the CTMs and DM cannot be 
fully blinded when they download the data, but all attempts will be made to blind the statistician and 
clinical scientist unti l after the database was locked. Also data for the evaluability meeting will be blinded 
by coding the options Own product and test product.  
3. Include stratification criteria into the protocol.  
4. Update the number of subjects enrolled to 32 instead of 30.  
 
Ame nded Protocol Section s for #1 : 
3.5.3  Exclusion Criteria  
Original Wording:   
EXCL0 2: Does your child currently have (or have a history of) any significant illness or

Amended Protocol S ection s for #2 : 
3.1 Clinical Trial Design  
   Original Wording:   
This will be a single center, single blinded  (sponsor’s team will be blinded to the product codes) , 
randomized, cross -over, IRB-Approved, in -home clinical test design over 6 weeks, with two usage 
periods of 3 weeks each.  
   Revised  Wording:   
This will be a single center, single blinded  (sponsor’s statistician and substitute clinical scientist for

Print Date:  23 February 2023                                 27 Amended Protocol Section s for #3 : 
3.1 Clinical Trial Design  
   Original Wording:   
The order of the NJ EU product and own product will be randomized.  
 Revised  Wording:   
The order of the NJ EU product and own product will be randomized.  At the end of visit 1, subjects 
will be randomized according to the strata as follows:   gender (M or F) and age (4 -5 or 6 -7). 
 
3.2.1  Visit 1 – Enrollment and Training (on Site)  
Original Wording:   
5. Subjects will be randomized to one of two usage periods, either starting with their own current product 
or starting with test product.  
Revised  Wording:   
5. Subjects will be randomly assigned to begin with either their own product or the tes t product per a 
stratified randomization plan that utilizes randomization strata based on child’s sex (male or female) and 
age group (4 -5 years or 6 -7 years). Randomization will be done so approximately 50% (n=16) of subjects 
will begin with their own prod uct and approximately 50% (n=16) of subjects will begin with the test 
product.  Product sequence will be assigned from a computer -generated randomization program 
provided by the Sponsor. The sequence of numbers used for the randomization will be 3 -digit 
consecutive numbers whose first digit will not be the same as the 4 -digit sequence used for subject 
identification (e.g., 301).

will begin with their own product and approxi mately 50% (n=16) of subjects will begin with the test 
product.  Product sequence will be assigned from a computer -generated randomization program 
provided by the Sponsor. The sequence of numbers used for the randomization will be 3 -digit 
consecutive number s whose first digit will not be the same as the 4 -digit sequence used for subject 
identification (e.g., 301).  
 
Amended Protocol Section s for #4 :

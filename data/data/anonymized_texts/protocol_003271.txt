Full Title  Randomized Multi -Center Study Comparing No  Drainage to 
Preoperative Biliary  Drainage Using Metal Stents in  Patients with 
Resectable Pancreatic or Periampullary  Cancer  
Short Title  Preoperative Biliary Drainage  RCT  
Objective(s)  To demonstrate that preoperative biliary drainage using self -expanding 
metal stents (SEMS) does not negatively impact overall surgical 
outcomes in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for treatment

unable to occur within 120 days will be followed up to 120 days after 
randomization.  
Patients who do not undergo surgery  as planned due to conversio n to 
palliative management or patient choice will be followed up to 120 
days after randomization.   If patient’s course of treatment requires 
placement of a biliary stent, stenting will be done per standard of care 
at each institution.  If a metal stent is required, a study WallFlex 
Biliary FC stent will be placed.

Statistical 
Hypothesis  A literature search of preoperative biliary drainage with self -expanding 
metal stents in patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer yielded 
eight articles with 305 patients.1-8 
A meta -analysis of the probability for pre -operative, operative and peri -
operative complications was performed.    A rate of 24.2% [95% CI: 13.2%, 
                                                                                                               Confidential

 37.2%] was calculated using th e eight  articles.  
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the  rate of complications 
for the Pre-Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group is non -inferior 
to the No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage  group.  The null hypothesis is 
that the complication rate is inferior in the Pre-Operative Biliary Drainage 
with SEMS  versus the No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage  group : 
𝐻𝑜: 𝜋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡−𝜋𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙  ≥∆  (Inferior)  
 
𝐻𝑎: 𝜋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡−𝜋𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙  <∆  (Non -inferior)  
 
where 𝜋𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡  and 𝜋𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 are the probabilities of having pre-operative, 
operative and peri -operative complications in the Pre-Operative Biliary 
Drainage with SEMS  arm and No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage  arm 
respectively, and ∆ is defined as the non -inferiority margin.  
 
The s ample size was calculated for a one -sided 0.050 exact Farrington -
Manning test using StatXact 9® . If the P value from the exact Farrington -
Manning test is <0.05 then the Pre-Operative Biliary Drainage with 
SEMS  group will be considered non -inferior to the No Pre -Operative 
Biliary Drainage  group. The expected  probability of complications in the  
Pre-Oper ative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  arm and No Pre -Operative 
Biliary Drainage  arm is 37.2%, which was taken from the upper limit of 
the 95% CI from the meta -analysis described above and from the only 
available Level 1 study comparing no drainage to preoperati ve stenting in 
which the complication rate was reported to be 39% in the no drainage 
arm.9 The non -inferiority margin ( ∆) is 15%.  Given these assumptions 
and a one -sided 5% significance level, 2 x 132 = 264 subjects will 
provide 80 % power to reject the nu ll hypothesis , that the Pre-Operative 
Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group is inferior to the No Pre -Operative 
Biliary Drainage  group.  
To compensate for possible loss of subjects after enrollment and complete 
assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria, an add itional 10% of subjects 
will be enrolled, for a total of 2 x 147 = 294 subjects.

 1. Introduction  
1.1. Pancreatic and Periampullary cancer  
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the US and worldwide  with 
217,000 new cases/year and 213,000 deaths worldwide .10, 11    Relative 1 -year and 5 -year 
survival rates are 26% and 6% respectively.11 
Pancreatic tumors are usually asymptomatic until the disease is advanced.  P resenting 
symptoms may include weight loss, jaundice, pain, nausea, dyspepsia and depression .12 
Diagnosis and staging is usually achie ved with a pancreas protocol CT, a triphasic cross -
sectional imaging with thin slices using multidetector CT13-16which allows for an assessment 
of the vascular invasion of the tumor , a major factor  in determini ng resectability . In patients  
where CT is not possible or co ntraindicated, MRI with contrast can be  used to diagn ose and 
stage pancreatic cancer.17  Pancreas protocol MRI has been emerging as an equivalent 
alternative to CT .18  Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can be used complementary to CT  to 
provide add itional vascular invasion information or to evaluate periampullary masses .19, 20 
Although histologic diagnosis is not necessary before surgical treatment, a biopsy can be 
taken using fine -needle aspiration with either EUS -guidance (preferred) or CT -guidanc e.18    
Diagnostic staging laparoscopy is also utilized, and is mostly valuable when there is a need to 
rule out sub -radiologic metastases (especially for body and tail lesions) .21, 22  
Based on results from imaging studies described above, p atients with pancrea tic cancer can 
be divided into four  prognostic subgroups  (Stages I-IV) to allow for choi ce of proper 
treatment course .  These groups are based on local tumor resectability status and presence or 
absence of distant disease  as defined by the tumo r-node -metastasis (TNM) staging system of 
the American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) .23 Patients in whom the primary tumor 
can be removed are classified as localized  resectable ( Stages I and II ), and patients whose 
tumors are unresectable are classifie d as locally advanced (Stage  III) and metastatic (Stage 
IV).24 
Criteria for resectability vary but usually include the absence of distant metastases and no 
tumor inv olvement of major arteries; in cases of venous invasion  of the tumor , there must be 
a suitable segment of portal vein (above) and superior mesenteric vein (below) the site of 
venous involvement to allow for venous reconstruction .25  
1.2. Treatment of Pancreatic /Periampullary  Cancer  
The only potential curative treatment option for patients with resectable 
pancreatic/periampullary cancers is curative -intent -surgery (CIS) by 
pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure)26 with a long -term survival rate of 20% and a 
median survival of 12 -20 months.24 Only 15 -20% of patients presenting with pancreatic 
cancer have potentially resectable tumors.27   
Most pancreatic cancers arise in the head of the pancreas and often cause bile duct 
obstruction resulting in jaundice, while body and tail lesions are insidious in their 
development and usually far advanced whe n detected.  Therefore most patients who are 
                                                                                                               Confidential  
20-Oct-2014                                                                                                        Boston Scientific  
FINAL                                                                                Preoperative Biliary Drainage RCT Protoc ol

 candidates for CIS have tumors in the head of the pancreas .28 The most common type of 
pancreatic cancer is adenocarcinoma, originating  from the pancreatic duct cells24 and 
accounting for over 90% of pancreatic m alignancies .12 
1.3. Biliary Drainage in Patients with Pancreatic /Periampullary  Cancer  
Biliary obstruction associated with  pancreatic/periampullary cancer occurs in up to 70% of 
patients .29  Hyperbilirubinemia  resulting from biliary obstruction advers ely affects liver, 
cardiovascular and renal function,26 and the subsequent cholestasis which is th ought to impair 
immune response and  clotting1 may negatively impact the  outcome of CIS.  P reoperative 
biliary draina ge potentially reverses these factors and could result in improved outcome of 
pancreaticoduodenectomy.26 
Preoperative biliary decompression has traditionally been achieved with plastic stents, 
however, these stents have been associated with high complication rates and relatively low 
success rates in preoperative management of biliary obstruction.1-3, 9, 30    
In recent publications, SEMS have been shown to be superior to plastic stents for 
preoperative biliary drainage in pancreatic cancer1 because of longer patency achieved by a 
greater stent diameter ,31 fewer ERCP procedures, and fewer episodes of 
cholangiti s/cholestasis due to stent occlusion while awaiting surgery (15% using SEMS vs 
93% using  plastic stents ).2   
2. Primary Objective  
The primary objective is t o demonstrate that preoperative biliary drainage using SEMS does 
not negatively impact overall surgical outcomes in patients undergoing 
pancreaticoduodenectomy for treatment of pancreatic or periampullary  cancer.  
3. Design   
3.1. Scale , Duration  and Investigators  
This is a post -market  (on label) , prospective, multi -center, randomized, non -blinded study.   
Patients will be followed for 120 days  after randomization.   Only patients who experience a 
delay in their planned surgery due to factors such as but not limited t o complications, biliary 
obstructive symptoms, patient physiologic status, etc. may be followed up to 150 days to 
allow for a 30 days post -surgery follow up visit.  
There will be up to 20 participating centers world -wide with anticipated enrollment of 294 
patients, 147 per group.    
At each investigational center, there will be one principal investigator (PI) and at least one 
Co-PI.  At a minimum, there will be one gastroenterologic endoscopist and one 
pancreaticobiliary surgeon among the investigators.  Al though more than two investigators 
per center are allowed, it is encouraged that the number be kept small.

 3.2. Treatment Assignment  
Patients will be randomized at baseline in equal proportions of 1:1 ratio between Group 1 and 
Group 2 as follows:  
• Group 1 : No pre-operative biliary drainage (patients will not receive a stent)  
• Group 2 : Pre-operative biliary drainage with a SEMS  
Block randomization through an online database system will be used.  Randomization will be 
stratified by study center.

ductal anatomy, namely stricture involving the cystic duct confluence, low cystic duct 
confluence, or other anatomic considerations to be specified.     
The WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Co vered and the WallFlex Biliary RX Uncovered Stent 
Systems are indicated for use in the palliative treatment of biliary strictures produced by 
malignant neoplasms  and relief of malignant biliary obstruction prior to surgery ; the 
WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered Stent System is also indicated for treatment of benign 
biliary strictures, per CE Mark  or other local regulations . For a detailed description of the 
WallFlex Biliary Stent Systems, please reference the Directions for Use ( DFU) included in 
each device package.  
Investigators should use the WallFlex Biliary RX Fully Covered and Uncovered Stent 
Systems in accordance with the DFUs.  
Study devices are labeled on the box and inner pouch and contain information including but 
not li mited to:  device name and dimensions, lot number, expiration date, name of legal 
manufacturer, and investigational use statement. Device labeling will be provided in local 
language(s) as per national regulations.

Stent placement should be such that the proximal end of the stent is minimum 2 cm from the 
hilum.   Performing a biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy or enlarging a prior 
sphincterotomy will be done at the discretion of the endoscopist.  
In case of a failed stent placement due to a device event, a new attempt to place a stent will 
be made.  If a stent placement is not possible due to non -device related reasons (such as 
inability to cannulate the CBD or reach the papilla, extensive tumor growth at site of papilla, 
etc.),  interventional radiologic (IR) access is allowed and, where possible, should be 
associated with placement of a study stent over a transhepatically inserted guide -wire in a 
"rendez -vous" procedure.  Percutaneous trans hepatic cholangiograpy (PTC) and a subsequent 
internal drainage with a stent placement may be done at the same time (one -stage procedure), 
or PTC with external drainage  may be performed 2 -3 days before stent insertion (two -stage 
procedure) per standard of  practice.  If access to the biliary tree or endoscopic placement of 
the study stent through a “rendez -vous” procedure fails and patient requires percutaneous 
transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), then the patient will exit the study.

 7.2. Screening   
• Informed Consent  
• Eligibility Criteria Assessment   
No study -specific testing will be conducted until the subject has signed the study specific  
informed consent form ( ICF).  
Informed consent must be obtained for all subjects who are potential study candidates. 
Subjects will be asked to sign the ICF before any study -specific tests or procedures are 
performed. The ICF is study -specific and must be approved by the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) at each center. Study personnel should explain that even 
if a subject agrees to pa rticipate in the study and signs  the study specific  ICF, the screening 
process may demonstrate that the subject is not a suitable candidate for the study.

7.11. Study Completion  
Each subject will be followed for 120 days from the time of randomization. In cases where 
patients experience a delay of planned surgery, the long term follow up can be extended up to 
150 days post randomization to allow for completion of a Follow -up Visit at 30 days  after 
surgery . 
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if the subject remains unresponsive to 
communication after three documented attempts by study staff.  
8. Statistical Considerations  
8.1. Hypothesi s 
Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the  rate of complications for the Pre-
Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group is non -inferior to the No Pre -Operative Biliary 
Drainage group. The null hypothesis is that the complication rate is inferior in the Pre -
Operative Bi liary Drainage with SEMS versus the No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage group:  
 
Ho: πtest−πcontrol  ≥∆  (Inferior)  
                                                                                                                 Confidential  
20-Oct-2014                                                                                                         Boston Scient ific 
FINAL                                                                                Preoperative Biliary Drainage RCT Protocol  
90914721 /Ver AD 
  Page 25 of 44 
  
Ha: πtest−πcontrol  <∆  (Non -inferior)  
 
where πtest  and πcontrol  are the probabilities of having pre -operative, operative and peri -
operative co mplications in the Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS arm and No Pre -
Operative Biliary Drainage arm respectively, and ∆ is defined as the non -inferiority margin.  
8.2. Sample Size  
A literature search of preoperative biliary drainage with self -expanding me tal stents in 
patients with pancreatic or periampullary  cancer yielded 8 articles with 305 patients.21-24, 27 -31 
The following meta -analysis of the probability for pre -operative, operative and post-
operative complications was done:  
• A rate of 24.2% [95% CI: 13.2%, 37.2%] was calculated using the 8 articles.  
 
The sample size was calculated for a one -sided 0.050 exact Farrington -Manning test using 
StatXact 9®. If the P value from the exact Farrington -Manning test is <0.05 then the Pre-
Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group will be considered non -inferior to the No Pre -
Operative Biliary Drainage  group. The expected  probability of complications in the  Pre-
Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  arm and No Pre -Operative Biliary Drainage  arm is 
37.2%, which was taken from the upper limit of the 95% CI from the meta -analysis described 
above and from the  only available Level 1 study comparing no drainage to preoperative 
stenting in which the complication rate was reported to be 39% in the no drainage arm.9 The 
non-inferiority margin ( ∆) is 15%.  Given these assumptions and a one -sided 5% significance 
level, 2 x 132 = 264 subjects will provide 80% power to reject the null hypothesis, that the 
Pre-Operative Biliary Drainage with SEMS  group is inferior to the No Pre -Operative Biliary 
Drainage  group.  
To compensate for possible loss of subjects after enrollmen t and complete assessment of 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, an additional 10% of subjects will be enrolled, for a total of 2 x 
147 = 294 subjects.  
8.3. Analysis Populations  
8.3.1.  Enrolled Cohort  
A subject is considered “enrolled” after signing the study -specific ICF.  Subjects who sign 
the ICF but subsequently do not meet one or more of the eligibility  criteria provided in 
Section  5.2 and Section 5.3  will be considered screen failures and excluded from the study.  
8.3.2.  Intent -to-Treat Cohort  
This cohort consists of those “en rolled” subjects who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and are subsequently randomized.  
                                                                                                                 Confidential

 8.3.3.  Per-Protocol Cohort  
The per -protocol cohort is a subset of the ITT subjects who are treated per protocol after 
randomization (Group 1 no stent, and Group 2 receive d a study stent)  and no major protocol 
deviations (ICH E9 definitions) . 
8.4. Data Analyses  
All statistical analyses will be done using The SAS System software, version 8 or higher 
(Copyright © 2000 SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Drive, Cary, North Carolina 27513, 
USA. All rights reserved).  
The distribution of prognostic factors between patients  with and without data will be 
examined. Statistical models that account for censored data will be employed in appropriate 
circumstances, e.g. for time -to-event outcomes. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to 
assess the impact of missing data  on the interpretation of the results , e.g. a tipping point 
analysis.  
 
8.4.1.  Baseline Data  
Baseline data will be summarized.  Subject  demographics, clinical history, risk factors, LFTs, 
tumor diagnosis, and obstruction symptoms  will be summarized using descriptive statis tics 
(e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and 
frequency statistics for discrete variables.  
  
8.4.2.  Post-Procedure Endpoints  
Post-procedure information will be collected at regularly scheduled follow -up examinations 
as detailed in the clinical study event schedule and will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics for continuous variables (e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, min imum, maximum) 
and frequency tables or proportions for discrete variables.  
8.4.3.  Subgroup Analyses  
The subgroup analyses will include tabulating  the primary endpoint and select secondary 
endpoints by gender.  
8.4.4.  Justification of Pooling  
The analyses will be presen ted using pooled data across institutions. An analysis of the 
poolability will be made using logistic regression for binary outcomes, analysis of covariance 
for continuous outcomes, or proportional hazards regression for time -to-event outcomes, to 
assess d ifferences between study institutions and to justify pooling data across institutions.

 8.4.5.  Multivariable Analyses  
Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed to assess possible predictors of the 
primary endpoint. Possible predictors may include any but not limited to 
demographic/baseline data and medical history data. Factors from the univariate model with 
p≤0.20 will also be modeled multivariately using a stepwise procedure in a generalized linear  
model  or Cox Proportional Hazards model . The significance thresholds for entry and exit into 
the model will be set to p<0.10.  
8.4.6.  Changes to Planned Analyses  
Any chan ges to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the analyses  will be 
documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan approved prior to performing the analyses.

• Myocardial infarction   
• Mortality   
9.4. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, 
performing procedures in the appropriate hospital environment, adherence to subject 
selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research 
procedures and/or follow -ups and b y promptly supplying BSC with all pertinent information 
required by this protocol.   The latter may facilitate inter -center communications regarding 
serious AEs.  
9.5. Anticipated Benefits  
Subjects may not receive any benefit from participating in this study but this study may 
provide a future benefit to medical science and other patients.   To date there is no broadly 
accepted standard of practice pertaining to pre -operative drainage of patients as defined by 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study.  
9.6. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
Based on prior BSC’s clinical studies and collected reports in literature to -date, the risk -to-
benefit ratio is within reason for fors eeable risks. However, literature reports do not always 
capture all side effects. Observation and fo llow up of subjects is required as outlined in the 
protocol.

Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity or 
frequency during the course of the investigation. Death should not be recorded as an AE, but 
should only be reflected as an outcome of a specific SAE (see Table 10.1-1 for AE 
definitions).  
Any AE experienced by the study subject after informed consent, whether during or 
subsequent to the procedure, must be recorded in the eCRF.  
Refer to Section 9 for the known risks associated with the study device(s).  
Adverse e vents that occur during the course of the study will be evaluated against a list of 
pre-specified complication criteria as defined in Section 12.14.  Determination of whether an 
AE meets the definition of a pre-specified complication wi ll be made by study physicians.  
10.2. Relationship to Study Device(s)  
The Investigator must assess the relationship of the AE to the study device as related or 
unrelated. See criteria in Table 10.2-2:  
Table 10.2-2: Criteria for Assessing Relationship of Study Device to Adverse Event  
Classification  Description  
Unrelated  The adverse event is determined to be due to a concurrent illness or 
effect of another device/drug and is not related to the investigational 
product.  
Related  • The adverse event is determined to be potentially related to the 
investigational product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less 
likely compared to the potential relationship to investigational 
product.  
• There is a strong relationship to investigational product, or recurs on 
re-challenge, and another etiology is unlikely.

10.3.1.   Serious Adverse Events   
These events should be reported to the Global Safety Office and/or Project Manager within 2 
business days  of first becoming aware of the event.  Events should be documented in the 
eCRF and all relevant source documentation for the event should be provided t o the Global 
Safety Office, as applicable.  
10.3.2.   Adverse Events  
Device -related events should be reported to the Global Safety Office and/or Project Manager 
within 10 business days  of first becoming aware of the event.  Unrelated AEs will not be 
collected.  
10.3.3.   Devi ce Failures, Malfunctions, and Product Nonconformities  
These events should be reported to Project Manager and/or Global Safety Office within 1 
business day  of first becoming aware of the event.  Events should be documented in the 
eCRF.  
10.4.  Boston Scientific De vice Deficiencies  
All device deficiencies (including but not limited to failures, malfunctions, use errors, 
product nonconformities, and labeling errors) will be documented and reported to BSC. If 
possible, the device(s) should be returned to BSC for analysis. Instructions for returning the 
investigational device(s) will be provided. If it is not possible to return the device, the 
investigator should document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of the 
device.  
Device deficiencies, failures, malfunctions , and product nonconformities are not to be 
reported as adverse events. However, if there is an adverse event that results from a device 
failure or malfunction, that specific event would be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.

12.1. Data Management  
12.1.1.   Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data will be recorded  in a limited access  secure electronic data capture (EDC) 
system.   
The clinical database will reside on a production server. All changes made to the clinical data 
will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review by Boston Scientific 
Corporation ( BSC ) or its representative. The associated software and database have been 
designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system 
compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies  pertaining to 
the use of electronic records and signatures. Database b ackups are performed regularly.  
The Investigator provide s his/her electronic signature on the appropriate electr onic case 
report forms (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature on printouts 
of the eCRFs must also be provided if requ ired by local regulation. Changes to data 
previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature by the Investigator  
acknowledging and approving the changes.  
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will 
be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all 
queries in the database.  
                                                                                                                 Confidential

 12.1.2.   Data Retention  
The Investigator will maintai n, at the investigative site,  in original format all essential study  
documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study subjects in 
compliance with ICH/GCP guidelines.  Documents must be retained for at least 2 years after 
the last approval of a marketing application or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of the clinical investigation of the product. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period of time by agreement with BSC or in complian ce with other local 
regulations . It is BSC’s responsibility to inform the Investigator when these documents no 
longer need to be maintained. The Investigator will take measures to ensure that these 
essential documents are not accidentally damaged or destro yed. If for any reason the 
Investigator withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody 
must be transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility and BSC must receive 
written notification of this custodial change.  
12.2.  Amendments   
If a protocol revision  is necessary which affect s the rights, safety or welfare of the subject or 
scientific integrity of the data , an amendment is required. Appropriate approvals (e.g., 
IRB/EC/ FDA/CA)  of the  revised protocol must be obtained prior to implementation.  
12.3.  Deviation s 
An Investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol, except to protect 
the life and physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. An investigator shall notify the 
sponsor and the  reviewing IRB/E C of any deviation from the investigational plan to protect 
the life or physical well-being  of a subject  in an emergency , and those deviations which 
affect the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation . Such notice shall be given a s soon 
as possible, but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurred, or per prevailing 
local requirements, if sooner than 5 working days.  
All deviations from the investiga tional plan , with the reason for the deviation  and the date of 
occurre nce, must be documented and reported to the sponsor  using the Protocol Deviation

clinical study . 
The ICF shall always be si gned and personally dated by the subject  or legal representative 
and by the investigator or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed 
consent process. If a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed 
consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original 
signed ICF will be retained by the center and a copy of the signed and dated document  and 
any other written information  must be given to the person signing the form.  
Failure to obtain subject  consent will be reported by BSC  to the applicable regulatory body 
according to their requirements (e.g. , FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learning 
of such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as 
deviations  to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC) , as appropriate . 
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject 's future health 
and medical care , that information shall be provided to the affected subject (s) in written form 
via a revised ICF or , in some situations, enrolled subjects  may be requested to sign and date 
an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the cours e of a 
study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments 
to the protocol, a change in P rincipal Investigator , administrative changes, or following 
annual review by the IRB/EC. The new version of the ICF must be ap proved by the IRB/EC.

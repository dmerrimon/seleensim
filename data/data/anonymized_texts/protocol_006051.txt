-3- 2. Introduction  
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative option for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes 
(MDS) or myeloproliferative disorders (MPD)1. However, conventional HCT after intensive cytotoxic conditioning 
regimen has been restricted to relatively young patients, without comorbidities. We have developed a 
nonmyeloablative regimen that allows allogeneic  HCT with HLA -matched related (MRD) or unrelated donors (URD) 
in older patients (up to 75 yrs old), and those with comorbidities. Results of phase I/II studies with this regimen have 
been very encouraging in most hematological malignancies2-5, but results in patients with chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia (C MML) and in patients with previously untreated MDS or MPD have been disappointing.  
 Sixty -one patients with CMML or previously untreated MDS/MPD were given grafts from MRD (n=32) or 
URD (n=29) after 200 cGy TBI with (n=59) or without (n=2) added fludarabi ne (90 mg/m²). Diagnosis were CMML 
(n=11), refractory anemia (RA, n=20), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS, n=2), RA with excess blasts (RAEB, 
n=11), RAEB in transformation (RAEB -T, n=4), and MPD (n=13). Forty -six patients had idiopathic diseases, while 
15 patients had secondary MDS.  Twenty patients achieved complete remissions 19 to 346 (median 32) days after 
HCT. Conversely, twenty -six of 61 patients (43%) had “ HCT failure”  due to graft rejection (n=11) and/or disease 
progression (n=24) before day 200 after HCT. Specifically, 15 of 26 (58%) patients with CMML or RAEB (T) and 11 
of 35 (31%) patients with RA (RS)/MPD had HCT failure before day 200. The 200 -day, 1 -yr and 2 -yr probabilities of 
progression free survival (PFS) were 27%, 19% and 11%, respectively, in patients with CMML or RAEB (T), and 
46%, 40%, and 37% respectively, in patients with RA (RS)/MPD.  
 We have recently shown that achievement of full donor T -cell chimeri sm was associated with a reduced risk 
of relapse (HR 0.5, P=0.002) in patients with hematological malignancies given nonmyeloablative conditioning6. 
Furthermore, a recent analysis comparing outcomes after nonmyeloablative versus myeloablative conditioning in 
previously untreated MDS patients has suggested that relapse/progression incidence might occur late r (P=0.22) in 
patients given myeloablative conditioning7. Taken together, these data suggest that increasing the intensity of the 
conditioning regimen in  order to prevent disease progression before establishment of full donor chimerism and 
occurrence of graft -versus -tumor (GVT) effects might improve outcomes of patients with CMML or untreated 
MDS/MPD given nonmyeloablative conditioning.  
 The aim of the cur rent protocol is to decrease the risks of HCT failure (defined as graft rejection and/or 
relapse)  in patients with CMML or with previously untreated MDS/MPD given nonmyeloablative conditioning. To 
do so, the protocol will escalate the TBI dose (300 cGy TBI  in level 1, 400 cGy in level 2, and 450 cGy in level 3) in 
order to define a low -dose conditioning regimen that is associated with a day -200 incidence of HCT failure  < 20%. 
Dose escalation will be carried out independently in two groups of patients:  
Arm A  – patients with MPD or MDS -RA/RARS  
Arm B – patients with MDS -RAEB or CMML.  
 
 
3.  Background  
 
A. Nonmyeloablative HCT with Fludarabine, Low -dose TBI and MMF/CSP  
The observations that GVT effects might be able to eradicate malignant cells more effectively than 
chemoradiotherapy, and that in an HLA -identical transplant setting, the host -versus -graft and the graft -versus -host 
reactions are mediated by T -cells led to the development of a nonmyeloablative HCT approach. In preclinical canine 
studies, it could be  shown that a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen consisting of 200 cGy TBI, followed by 
post-transplant immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for 28 days and cyclosporine (CSP) for 35 
days resulted in stable engraftment in DLA -identical lit termates8. The initial transplant regimen was the same as that 
developed in dogs and consisted of 200 cGy TBI given on day 0, and postgrafting immunosuppression with MMF 
(given for 28 days) and CSP (discontinued on day 56) 2. The stem cell sources were peripheral blood stem cells 
(PBSC), and donors were HLA -identical siblings. The transplant regimen was remarkably well tolerated, with the 
majori ty of eligible patients receiving their transplants in the outpatient setting. Nine of the 44 first patients (20%) 
given this regimen had nonfatal graft rejections 2. In order to reduce the risk of graft rejection, fludarabine 30 
mg/m2/day × 3 days was added to the 200 cGy TBI, and the rejection rate decreased to 3% 9. In an attempt to reduce 
the incidence of acute GVHD, the duration of CSP administration was extended from 56 to 77 or 180 days, while the 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-4- duration of MMF (days 0 to 27) was kept constant. This strategy was associated with a significantly reduced 
incidence of grade III -IV acute GVHD10.  
 The same regimen of fludarabine and 200 cGy TBI was used to condition patients with 10/10 -HLA -antigen 
matched URD 3,4. The postgrafting immunosuppression with MMF was extended to 40 days with taper to day 96 and 
CSP was given for 100 days with taper through day 180. Durable engraftment was observed in 82% of PBSC (n=71) 
and 56% of marrow recipients (n=18). Based on this observation, all subsequent URD were given PBSC grafts. 
Among unrelated PBSC recipients, graft rejections wer e more frequently observed in patients given PBSC containing 
less than 6.8 x106 CD34+ cells/kg11. Further, s ub-optimal postgrafting immunosuppression with MMF was suggested 
by pharmacokinetic studies showing that the t1/2 of mycophenolic acid, the active metabolite of MMF, was 3 hours, 
and its binding to IMPDH II rapidly reversible. Indeed, increasing administration of MMF from 15 mg/kg bid to 15 
mg/kg tid increased the rate of durable engraftment from 82% to 95% (98/103 patients) ( P=0.004)12.   
 More than 800 patients ineligible for conventional HCT have been treated with this  approach so far in various 
centers in the United States and Europe. Preliminary data in the first 451 patients receiving HCT after 
nonmyeloablative conditioning for hematological malignancies have demonstrated that the nonmyeloablative regimen 
used was sa fe and was associated with minimal toxicity and relatively low nonrelapse mortality, even in patients 
otherwise excluded from allogeneic HCT (Table 1) 5. Given the age and status of disease of patients treated on the 
nonmyeloablative protocols, the rate of GHV D was not higher than in conventional HCT13, while transplant -related 
toxicities and 1 -yr nonrelapse mortality were significantly lower14,15.

malignancies.5

B. Results with reduced -intensity conditioning in patients with MDS/MPD  
 
Ho et al.  reported results in  62 MDS patients (median age 56 yrs) given allografts from MRD (n=24) or URD (n=38) 
after reduced -intensity conditioning with fludarabine (150 mg/m²), oral busulfan (8 mg/kg), and alemtuzumab (100 
mg total dose)16. Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of CSP alone. Sixteen patients had RA, 19 RAEB, 23 
RAEBT or tAML, and 4 CMML. The 1 -yr probabilities of nonrelapse mortality, overall survival (OS) and PFS were 
5%, 73% and 61% , respectively for MRD recipients, and 21%, 71% and 59%, respectively, for URD recipients. 
Twenty -six patients required DLI, given 126 -1323 days after HCT, for cytogenetic (n=4) or morphologic relapse 
(n=6), or for decreased donor marrow chimerism (n=16). Four of 4 patients given DLI for cytogenetic relapse but 
none of 6 patients given DLI for morphologic relapse responded, and 14 of 16 patients given DLI for decreasing 
marrow chimerism achieved full donor marrow chimerism after DLI. The 2 -yr cumulative inc idences (including 
patients given DLI) of grade III -IV acute GVHD were 17% and 23% for MRD and URD recipients, respectively.  
 Bornhauser et al.  reported data from 42 patients given allogeneic PBSC after conditioning with fludarabine 
(120 mg/m²) and busulfa n (16 mg/kg, with dose adjustments to plasma levels of 900 +/ - 100 ng/mL)17. Diagnosis

2) or treated AML developing from MDS (n=10; 5 in CR; 5 resistant), and CMML (n=5). GVHD prophylaxis 
consisted of MTX and CSP. All patients had sustaine d engraftment. Grade II -IV acute GVHD occurred in 54% of 
patients, and extensive chronic GVHD was seen in 23% of patients. The 18 -month incidences of nonrelapse mortality, 
relapse, OS and PFS were 24%, 41%, 42%, and 35%, respectively.   
 Kroger et al.  reported results from 37 MDS patients (median age 55 yrs) given grafts from MRD (n=19) or 
URD (n=18) after conditioning with fludarabine (120 -180 mg/m²) and busulfan (8 mg/kg p.o. or 6.4 mg/kg i.v.) with 
(n=25) or without (n=12) added ATG18. GVHD prophylaxis combined CSP with MTX or MMF.  Diagnoses at 
transplantation were RA (n=8), RAEB (n=6), RAEBT (n=13), CMML (n=3), and secondary AML (n=7). Grade II -IV 
acute GVHD was seen in 37% of patients , and chronic GVHD in 48%. Nonrelapse mortality was 12% in patients 
given graft from MRD versus 45% in patients given grafts from URD. The 3 -yr probabilities of OS and PFS were 
39% and 38%, respectively.  
 De Lima et al.  compared HCT outcomes of 94 patient s given allogeneic HCT after nonmyeloablative 
(fludarabine (120 mg/m²), cytarabine (4 g/m²), and idarubicin (36 mg/m²)) or reduced -intensity (fludarabine (100 -150 
mg/m²) and melphalan (140 or 180 mg/m²)) conditioning19.  The 3 -yr probabilities of OS were 30% in the 
nonmyelo ablative group and 35% (NS) in the fludarabine/melphalan group. Nonmyeloablative patients had less 
treatment related complications, a lower incidence of grade III -IV acute GVHD (11% vs. 19%, NS), a lower 
nonrelapse mortality (16% vs. 39%, p=0.036), and a h igher risk of relapse (53% vs. 26%, p=0.029) than patients 
given fludarabine plus melphalan. However, these differences could not simply be explained by differences in the 
intensity of the conditioning, since nonmyeloablative recipients were mainly given b one marrow from MRD while 
fludarabine/melphalan patients mainly received PBSC from URD, and this could have impacted both the GVHD 
incidence and GVT effects. In addition, 19% of patients in the nonmyeloablative group experienced graft rejection, 
and most o f the remainder had mixed chimerism, and this might explain the reduced GVT effects.  
 
C. Effects of TBI dose on outcome in patients given myeloablative conditioning  
Two randomized and one large nonrandomized trial have explored the importance of TBI dose on HCT outcomes20. 
In total, 71 patients with AML in first remission were treated with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and either 12 Gy 
(n=34) or 15.75 Gy ( n=37) of TBI followed by HLA -matched sibling transplantation21. GVHD prophylaxis consisted 
of CSP and MTX. The relapse rate in the group receiving the lower TBI dose was 35% compared to 12% with the 
higher TBI dose ( P=0.06).  
 In a similar prospective randomized trial in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase, the 
relapse rate in the 57 patients treated with the lower TBI dose was 25% compared to 0% in the 59 recipients of th e 
higher TBI dose ( P=0.008)22. In both studies, nonrelapse mortality was higher with the higher TB I dose, thus 
balancing the reduction in relapse rates, with a result that in neither study OS was improved. Yet, these two 
prospective randomized studies argue that a relatively modest 30% increase in TBI dose could significantly reduce the 
risk of relapse , suggesting that increasing the TBI dose from 2 Gy to 3 -4.5 Gy might by itself reduce the risk of 
relapse.  
 
D. Retrospective comparison on outcomes of MDS patients given allogeneic HCT after myeloablative or 
nonmyeloablative conditioning at FHCRC  
 
Scott et al.  recently compared efficacy of HCT after myeloablative conditioning with busulfan [targeted (800 -900 
ng/mL; starting dose 1 mg/kg every 6 hours for 16 doses)] and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) (n=132), or 
nonmyeloablative conditioning with 200 cGy TBI  and fludarabine (90 mg/m², n=40) conditioning in MDS patients 
over 40 yrs of age7. The WHO distribution (highest at any time before HCT) was RA/RARS in 38% of the 
myeloablative and 24% of the nonmyeloablative recipients, RAEB in 31% of the myeloablative and 24% of the 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-6- nonmyeloablative recipients, and transformed AML 31% of the myeloablative and 53% of the nonmyeloablative 
recipients. The 3 -yr probabilitie s of PFS were 44% in myeloablative recipients, and 28% in nonmyeloablative 
recipients. In multivariate analyses, there were no significant differences in OS (HR 0.9, p=0.84), PFS (HR 1.0, 
p=0.93), and relapse risk (HR 0.8, p=0.43) between the myeloablative  versus nonmyeloablative recipients, suggesting 
that GVT effects were more important than conditioning intensity in preventing relapse in patients with MDS. When 
considering only patients who had durable complete responses to pretransplant chemotherapy, pr ogression -
free survival and progression rates did not differ between myeloablative and nonmyeloablative cohorts. This 
finding suggested that the intensity of transplant conditioning was not the decisive factor in preventing post -
transplant progression amon g patients with tAML and RAEB who had responded to treatment and had less 
than <5% marrow myeloblasts at the time of HCT. Presumably, the pretransplant induction chemotherapy 
substituted for a more intensive conditioning regimen by reducing the disease bur den before HCT, and the 
use of myeloablative conditioning offered no additional gain in progression prevention but added regimen -
related toxicity.  
In contrast to patients with tAML and RAEB, looking at the 51 patients with RA (not given chemotherapy befor e 
HCT), 7 of 42 (17%) patients given myeloablative conditioning versus 3 of 9 (33%) patients given nonmyeloablative 
conditioning progressed/relapsed. As shown in figure 1, there was a suggestion that progressions occurred later in 
patients given myeloablat ive conditioning.  This observation suggests that pretransplant chemotherapy may not 
only reduce the disease burden, as measured by pre -HCT marrow morphology in patients with advanced 
MDS, but may also have effects not measurable by morphology that facilita te donor T -cell engraftment 
(leading to faster achievement of full donor T -cell chimerism) in the nonmyeloablative cohort and decrease 
risk of disease progression.

consortium)  
 
Patients  
Sixty -one patients with CMML or previously untreated MDS/MPD were given grafts from MRD (n=32) or URD 
(n=29) after 200 cGy TBI with (n=59) or without (n=2) added fludarabine. Median patient age was 59 (range, 5 -73) 
yrs. Diagnoses were CMML (n=11), RA (n=20), RARS (n=2), RAEB (n=11), RAEB -T (n=4), and MPD (n=13). 
Forty -six patients had idiopathic diseas es, while 15 patients had secondary MDS.  
 
Engraftment and graft rejection  
Median donor T -cell chimerism levels on days 28, 56 and 84 were 65%, 62% and 68%, respectively (Figure 2). The 
figures were 98%, 99% and 98% among granulocytes, and 92%, 90% and 92% among bone marrow cells. Twenty -
eight patients (46%) achieved full donor T -cell chimerism 26 to 789 days (median 144 days) after HCT. Eleven 
patients [6 patients given grafts from MRD (including 1 of 2 patients given 200 cGy TBI only as conditioning), and 
five additional patients given grafts from HLA -matched URD (including 1 of 2 marrow recipients)] had graft rejection 
14 to 184 (median 64 days) after HCT.

F. Impact of achievement of full donor T -cell chimerism on relapse after nonmyeloablative conditioning  
We have analyzed GVT  effects in 322 patients given nonmyeloablative conditioning for hematologic malignancies6. 
Multivariate time -dependent cox regressions models were used to assess the impact of achievement of full donor T -
cell chimerism on HCT outcomes. Achievement of full donor T -cell chimerism was associated with a reduced risk of 
relapse/progression (HR 0.5,  P=0.002), and a trend for a better PFS (P=0.11).   
 
 
G. Dose -response relationship of TBI with engraftment rates in a pre -clinical dog model.  
A close relationship between TBI dose and rate of sustained engraftment of dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) identical 
marrow has been demonstrated in a preclinical canine model (Table 2). A TBI dose of 920 cGy was sufficiently 
immunosuppressive to permit engraftment of DLA -identical littermate marrow in 95% of dogs, even without 
postgrafting immunosuppression23. When the TBI dose was  decreased to 450 cGy, 48% of dogs achieved sustained 
engraftment24. Since both host -versus -graft (rejection) and graft -versus -host reactions are mediated by T -cells after 
DLA -identical HCT, it was hypothesized that optimizing post -transplant immunosuppressio n might not only prevent 
GVHD, but also increase the engraftment rate. Indeed, 7 of 7 dogs given 450 cGy TBI and postgrafting with CSP 
achieved sustained engraftment24. When the TBI dose was further decreased to 200 cGy, postgrafting 
immunosuppression either with CSP alone or with a combination of CSP and MTX resulted in graft rejection with 
autologous recovery in 4 of 4 dog and 3 of 5 dogs studied, respectively25. Conversely, stable mixed chimerism was 
achieved in 11 of 12 dogs given postgrafting immunosuppression with MMF and CSP25. When the TBI dose was 
further decreased to 100 cGy, all dogs experienced graft rejection, demonstrating a delicate balance between host -
versus -graft and graft -versus -host reactions25,26. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that increasing the 
dose of TBI will promote engraftment in MDS/MPD/CMML patients.

H. What is the upper limit for nonmyeloablative TBI?  
At the dose of 45 0 cGy, of 21 dogs studied, 14 (67%) receiving DLA -identical marrow but no growth factors 
survived, 10 with successful allografts (including 5 mixed chimeras) and 4 with autologous recovery; whereas 7 
animals died, 5 (24%) from infections during marrow apla sia, and 2 from acute GVHD27. In contrast, 30 of 34 dogs 
(88%) given hematopoietic growth factors (G -CSF, SCF, or the combination of G -CSF and SCF) in addition to the 
DLA -identical marrow graft survived, 17 with successful allografts (including 10 mixed  chimeras), and 13 with 
autologous recovery; whereas 4 (12%) died, all with infection related to marrow aplasia after rejection of the 
allograft27. Thus, 13 of 17 (76%) dogs without evidence of donor engraftment had autologous recovery. Survival was 
similar for recipients of G -CSF, SCF, or the combination of G -CSF and SCF. Logistic regression analyses showed a 
trend for improved survival in dogs given growth factors ( P=0.09), no change in allogeneic engraftment (P=0.74), and 
an increase in autologous rec overy ( P=0.22). The experiments suggested that, while a TBI dose of 450 cGy was 
myeloablative and supralethal in dogs not given hematopoietic growth factors, autologous reconstitution occurred in 
76% of dogs without donor engraftment in the presence of hem atopoietic growth factors. Therefore, the upper limit 
dose of TBI will be 450 cGy in this protocol.  
 
 
I. Current experience with 300 cGy TBI as 2nd HCT regimen in patients with graft rejection.  
Three hundred cGy TBI in combination with 90mg/m2 of fludarabine have been used as a 2nd transplant regimen in 
12 patients with graft rejection both after nonmyeloablative and conventional conditioning regimens at FHCRC, 
Stanford University and University of Leipzig. Eleven patients had successful 2nd grafts, and one patient failed to 
engraft. Eight patients were alive 133 days to 4 yrs after 2nd HCT, while 4 patients died. There were no undue acute 
toxicities, and none of the four died as a direct consequence of the conditioning regimen. Two of the 4 pat ients died 
of pulmonary problems: one at day +456 from ARDS/pneumonitis and the other at day +36 from pre -existing 
advanced fungal pneumonitis. One of the other two patients died from GVHD/infections and the other from disease 
progression.

FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-11- J.     Experience with unrelated HCT after 550 cGy TBI and Cyclophosphamide.  
Girgis et al.  reported data from 110 patients with hematologic malignancies given unrelated marrow after 550 cGy 
TBI (given at 30 cGy/min) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg)28. Postgrafting immun osuppression consisted of 
CSP, MTX and prednisone. Median patient age was 44 (range, 19 to 62) yrs. Twenty -six patients had good risk 
diagnosis (AML in CR1 or CML -CP), while 84 patients had poor risk diagnosis. Primary and secondary graft failure 
occurred in 6 patients (3 had CML, 2 had MDS, 1 had NHL) and 1 patient (with CML), respectively. Most patients 
with graft failure had autologous reconstitution (Adkins et al., personal communication), although 2 of them died 
because of graft failure. Fatal organ to xicity occurred in 2 patients (1 cardiac toxicity and 1 renal failure with TTP), 
whereas life -threatening grade IV organ toxicity occurred in 5 patients (1 mucositis, 3 SOS, 1 hemorrhagic cystitis). 
Incidences of grade II -IV and III -IV acute GVHD were 33% and 18%, respectively. Limited and extensive chronic 
GVHD were seen in 11% and 59% of patients, respectively. Cumulative rates of nonrelapse mortality in patients 
with good and poor risk diseases were 19% and 42%, respectively. The 3 -yr probability of OS a nd PFS were 47% 
and 40% for good risk patients, and 25% and 21% for poor risk patients, respectively. We, therefore, believe it is safe 
to increase the dose of TBI from 200 to 300 -450 cGy for patients with MDS/MPD/CMML.  
 
K.    Impact of TBI dose on testicu lar function.  
 
Most of our understanding of the effects of radiation on human testis came from 2 studies 29,30 of single exposure 
delivered directly to the testis of normal men. Men given < 10 rad did not have testicular damage. A transient 
reduction in sperm concentration was observed in patients whose gonadal dose was only 15 rad, while azoospermia 
occurred in a ll patients exposed to 100 to 600 rad29,30. Regarding recovery of testicular function following radiation 
exposure, Rowley et al. reported a return of sperm counts to pre -irradiation levels after 30 months when irradiation 
levels were between 200 and 300 rads, and after 5 yrs or more when irradi ation doses were between 400 to 600 rad29. 
Paulsen et al.  reported similar findings although earlier recovery at approximately 30 months was observed in 2 
patients given 400 rad who had sufficient long -term information30. 
 
 
L. Assessment of Pretransplant Comor bidities  
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a well -known simple index to score comorbidities which was developed to 
provide prediction of risks of survival after treatment of chronic medical illnesses31. The Seattle team used this index 
in 2004 to score p retransplant comorbidities among patients diagnosed with hematological malignancies and offered 
HCT. The CCI was helpful in predicting risks of non -relapse mortality and survival32,33. However, the CCI showed a 
limited ability in capturing comorbidities among the transplanted population. Therefore, the same authors investigated 
the possibility of mod ifying the original CCI to better capture comorbidities among transplanted patients34. They tried 
to a) better define previously identified comorbidities utilizing pretransplant laboratory data, b) investigate additional 
HCT -related comorbidities, and c) e stablish comorbidity scores that were suited for HCT. This resulted in developing 
a new HCT -specific comorbidity index (HCT -CI), which captured comorbidities among 62% of patients with scores 
>0 compared to 12% captured by the original CCI34. Additionally, the new index was superior to the old CCI in 
prediction of survival (likelihood ratio of 23.7 versus 7.1 and c statistics of 0.661 versus 0.561, P=<0.0001, 
respectively).  
 
M.  Impact of PBSC composition on outcomes after nonmyeloablative c onditioning  
 
Three recent studies have analyzed the impact of cell dose on outcome after nonmyeloablative conditioning. We 
reported data from 125 patients given PBSC from HLA -identical siblings  after 2 Gy TBI with or without fludarabine. 
Higher number of C D34+ cells transplanted was associated with better OS ( P = 0.03)39. No correlations between the 
doses of CD3, CD4 and CD8+ T cell transplanted and outcomes (and particularly acute GVHD) were identified. Cao 
et al. , using the same preparative regimen combin ing 2 Gy TBI with or without fludarabine, found that a higher 
number of transplanted CD8+ T cells in the graft correlated with increased T -cell chimerism levels and better OS ( P  = 
0.01) in a study analyzing combined observations in 63 patients given PBSC from either related ( n = 38) or unrelated 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-12- (n = 25) donors40. We observed that higher numbers of grafted CD34+ cells (the median CD34 cell dose was 6.5 x 
10(6)/kg) were associated with higher levels of day 28 donor T -cell chimerism ( P = 0.01), rapid achieve ment of 
complete donor T -cell chimerism ( P = 0.02), and a trend for lower risk for graft rejection ( P = 0.14) in 116 patients 
given unrelated PBSC  after 2 Gy TBI and fludarabine. No correlations between doses of CD3, CD4 or CD8+ T-cell 
transplanted and GVHD/survival were identified.  Taken together, those data suggest that relatively high doses of 
CD34+ cells should be transplanted in patients given nonmyeloablative conditioning, particularly in patients with 
CML, MDS or MPD41. 
 
4. Proposal  
 
The current protocol’s primary objective  is to decrease the incidence of day -200 HCT failure (graft rejection and /or 
progression) < 20% in patients with CMML or untreated MDS/MPD given related or unrelated HLA -matched HCT 
following nonmyeloablat ive conditioning.  The plan is to achieve these goals by increasing the intensity of the pre -
transplant TBI. The proposed conditioning regimen will continue to use fludarabine, 30 mg/m2/day x 3 days, while the 
initial TBI dose will be increased from 200 cG y to 300 cGy.  If this regimen fails to decrease the HCT failure rate 
sufficiently, the TBI dose will be increased to 400 cGy (level 2) and then to 450 cGy (level 3). Enrollment in each 
cohort will stop if the true rate of HCT failure on day +200 is greate r than 20% (dose escalation rules; enrolment in 
each levels will occur in groups of 6 patients), and following patients will be included in the next cohort, or when 24 
patients will be included. Dose escalation will be carried out independently in two grou ps of patients: Arm A – 
patients with MPD or MDS -RA/RARS and, Arm B – patients with MDS -RAEB or CMML. Stopping rules for the 
protocol will be 25% nonrelapse mortality within 200 days. Secondary objectives  will be relapse/progression, PFS, 
kinetics of donor  engraftment (chimerism), and infections.  
 
 
5. Primary Objectives   
By escalating the intensity of the TBI prior to HCT, the primary objective is to:  
1. Decrease the incidence of day -200 HCT failure to < 20% in patients with MDS -RA (RS)/MPD and in patients 
with CMML/RAEB.  
 
6. Secondary Objectives: to determine:  
1. The rate of relapse/progression in patients with MPD or MDS -RA and those with CMML or MDS -RAEB.  
2. The probability of PFS in patients with MPD or MDS -RA and those with CMML or MDS -RAEB.  
3. The kinetics of d onor engraftment.  
4. The incidence of infections.

8.4 Exclusion Criteria -URD  
 
(A) A positive anti -donor cytotoxic crossmatch is an absolute donor exclusion.  Donors are excluded when 
preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment. This 
determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution. The recommended procedure for pat ients 
with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and 
class II antigens for all patients before HCT. If the PRA shows >10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell 
cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained. The donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays 
are positive.  For those patients with an HLA Class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross 
matches should be obtained regardless  of the PRA results.  
(B)  Marrow donors  
(C) Donors who are HIV -positive and/or medical conditions that would result in increased risk to the donor G -CSF 
mobilization and G -PBMC collections.  
(D) Serious medical or psychological illness

(F) Prior malignancy within the preceding five yrs, with the exception of non -melanoma skin cancers.  
(G) HIV seropositivity  
 
 9.   Informed Consent  
A conference will be held with the patient and family to discuss this study and alternative treatments available for the 
underlying disease.  A separate conference will be held for the donor. The conference will be conducted by the 
outpatient -attending physician.  All potential risks associated with the use of fludarabine, low dose TB I, 
immunosuppressive drugs, HCT, GVHD, infections, rejection, disease progression/recurrence, risk of infertility and 
DLI should be discussed as objectively as possible. Specifically, the advantages and risks of this approach in 
comparison to non transplan t strategies and myeloablative HCT should be discussed.  Informed consent from the 
patient will be obtained using a form approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Fred Hutchinson 
Cancer Research Center and the local IRB if the patient is trea ted in a collaborating institution.  
 
 
10. Protocol Registration  
FHCRC patients :  Eligible patients will be identified by the Clinical Coordinators Office.  Patients will be registered 
with the Registration Office (206 -667-4728) between 8:30  am and 4:00 PM,  Monday through Friday. After hours, the 
Registration office can be reached by paging (206) 995 -7437.  
 
 
Collaborating institutions :  Eligible patients will be identified by the principal investigator of the collaborating 
institution who will register the patient with the FHCRC.  Registration will include completion of the eligibility 
checklist/demographic form ( Appendix L ).  This form will be faxed to the trial coordinator (206 -667-5378).  
Questions regarding eligibility or protocol information should be d irected to Brenda Sandmaier, M.D. (206 -667-

B. Cytoreduction:  Cytoreduction, radiation therapy or both may be given by the referring physician or the 
attending physician as determined on clinical  grounds or to meet eligibility requirements of the protocol for 
patients with CMML.  However, no intensive chemotherapy can be given within 3 weeks prior to initiating 
conditioning (see exclusion criteria).  The need for this therapy should be discussed w ith the principal 
investigator. The referring oncologist may be asked to administer this therapy.  
 
C. Discontinuation of Hydroxyurea and other medications:   For patients who are under hydroxyurea prior to 
HCT, this medication should be discontinued on day  -2. Thalidomide, lenalidomide, arsenic trioxide, imatinib 
mesylate and farnesyl transferase inhibitors should be discontinued at least 3 weeks prior to HCT.  
 
D. Conditioning Regimen: (refer to Figure 6  and Tables 3 A/B ) 
 
 Days -4, -3 and –2:  Fludarabine 30mg /m2/day IV.  
 Day 0:  TBI 300 cGy (level 1), 400 cGy (level 2) or 450 cGy (level 3) at 6 -7 cGy/min from linear 
accelerator followed by HCT.  Regardless of the actual time of TBI administration on DAY 0, 
immunosuppression should be given per schedule and prior to the inf usion of PBSCs.

G-CSF mobilized PBSC from MRD or URD will be the only source of hematopoietic stem cells. Two  12-liter 
leukaphereses on consecutive days, day –1 and day 0, will be obtained, and cells will be infused together on 
day 0 following TBI. Refer to institutional practice guidelines for methods of infusion. If the CD34 cell dose 
is <5.0 x 106/kg after the  second collection, a third day collection should be added, and extra dose of G -CSF 
should be given to the donor before the final collection (see also section G).

complete, then to b e given at 15mg/kg PO q8hrs until day +40, and then taper to day +96.  
 
a. CSP  
1. Starting Dose :   
 
A. Adult dose.  CSP (Neoral is preferred) is given orally at 5.0mg/kg q12hrs PO (based on adjusted body 
weight) from day –3 until day +56 (MRD) or +100 (URD).  Dose should be adjusted to maintain a high 
therapeutic CSP level as discussed below.  If there is nausea and vo miting at any  time during CSP 
treatment the drug should be given intravenously at the dose that was used to obtain a therapeutic level.  
The conversion from oral CSP (Neoral) to intravenous cyclosporine = oral cyclosporine dose divided by 
2.5 equals IV dos e.  Use CSP levels to further adjust the dose.  The formulation of CSP can be changed to 
Sandimmune if nausea and vomiting are persistent.  
 
B. Pediatric Dose :  Due to the variable and increased metabolism in children, CSP will be started 
intravenously at t he following doses at day –3 to be adjusted to maintain a therapeutic level as 
specified below.  CSP trough level should be obtained on day 0 and CSP dose adjusted to ensure 
therapeutic levels.  The patient may be changed to oral CSP after HCT when he or s he is able to 
take oral medications.  Dose should be adjusted to maintain high therapeutic levels as discussed 
below.  If nausea or vomiting occur at any time during CSP treatment, CSP should be administered 
intravenously at the dose that was used to obtai n a therapeutic level.  The conversion from oral 
CSP (Neoral) to intravenous cyclosporine = oral cyclosporine dose divided by 2.5 equals the IV 
dose.  Use CSP levels to further adjust the dose.  
 Age 6 years old:  1.6mg/kg IV q8hrs  
 Age >6 years old:  2.0mg /kg IV q12hrs.  
 
Continuous infusion of cyclosporine may be appropriate due to toxicity or variable levels.  Infuse total 
daily dose over 22 -24 hours by continuous IV infusion.  
 
2. In the absence of GVHD, for MRD recipients : CSP is to be tapered from day +56 and discontinued 
on day + 180; for URD recipients : CSP is to be tapered from day +100 and discontinued on day + 
180.  The referring physician, who will receive explicit instructions and guidelines for detecting and 
manag ing GVHD, will manage this. Modifications of the taper schedule may be indicated if 
significant disease progression occurs early post -transplant (see section K below).  
 
3. Blood pressure, renal function (serum creatinine, BUN), electrolytes and magnesium need  to be 
followed at least three times per week during the first month, twice weekly until day +100, then once 
per week until CSP is stopped, unless clinical circumstances suggest the need for more frequent 
evaluations.   
 
4. CSP Dose Adjustments:  Initial high Cyclosporine (CSP) doses are required based  
on the pre clinical nonmyeloablative canine studies, which used an equivalent dose to establish an 
allograft.  After day +28, CSP levels typical for unrelated HCT will be targeted.  Dose reduction should 
only be  made if CSP toxicity is present, and/or levels exceed values provided in Table 4.  There are two 
methods for calculating CSP levels.  Table 4 provides desired levels for specific methods.  To avoid 
inadequate immune suppression, dose reductions should be conservative.  Therapeutic levels of CSP 
should be maintained.

5. CSP Monitoring:   Further CSP determinations should be performed on a twice weekly basis for the 
first month and then weekly until day +100 unless high levels are detected (i.e., >600 ng/ml), or 
toxicity is suspected in which case more frequent monitoring will be performed as clinically 
indicated.  Routine monitoring of CSP will not be required for patients on a CSP taper unless 
clinically indicated.  
 
6. Drugs Interactions:  Drugs that may affect CSP levels are shown in Table 5 .

b. MMF  
 
1. Initiating MMF Therapy:   Oral administration of MMF will be given based on adjusted body weight 
at 15mg/kg q12hrs (30mg/kg/day) for MRD recipients,  and at 15mg/kg q8hrs (45mg/kg/day) for 
URD recipients,  from the evening of day 0 (i.e. first dose to follow 4 -6 hours after HCT).  Doses will 
be rounded to the nearest 250mg (capsules are 250mg).  If there is nausea and vomiting at any time 
preventing the oral administration of MMF, MMF should be administered intravenously based on 
adjusted body weight at 15mg/kg q12hrs for MRD recipi ents, or 15mg/kg q8hrs for URD recipients.  
 
2. Tapering of MMF:   MRD recipients : MMF will be given daily at 15mg/kg q12hrs through day +27, 
and then in the absence of GVHD, discontinued on day 28. URD recipients:  MMF will be given daily 
at 15mg/kg q8hrs throug h day +40 post transplant, and then in the absence of GVHD, MMF should 
be tapered at day +40 by 10%/week x 8 weeks and discontinued on day +96.  
 
3. Maintaining MMF:   Markedly low (<40%) donor T -cell chimerism after HCT may indicate 
impending graft rejection35. MMF should be continued at full dose or, if MMF taper has been 
initiated, reinsti tution of full dose MMF should occur.  Consideration of graft salvage with use of 
pentostatin + DLI (as per protocol 1825) or other institutional protocol should be considered.  
 
4. Guidelines for MMF dose adjustment due to drug toxicity:   
 If in the clinical judgment of the investigator the observed toxicity is related to MMF 
administration, a dose adjustment may occur.  The discontinuation of MMF at any point should 
be discussed with the Study PI and should be documented in the permanent medical record and 
all Case Report Forms (CRF).  
 Gastrointestinal Toxicity .  Severe gastrointestinal toxicities such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage 
have been very rare after nonmyeloablative HCT. In the event of gastrointestinal toxicity that 
requires medical intervention inclu ding medication for control of persistent vomiting or diarrhea 
that is considered to be due to MMF after day +28, a 20% dose reduction will be made or the Decrease CSP Levels  Increase CSP Levels    Enhance Potential for Nephrotoxicity

-22- drug may be given IV. If severe refractory diarrhea or overt gastrointestinal bleeding occurs, 
MMF ma y be temporarily stopped. The MMF should be restarted at 20% reduced dose when the 
underlying toxicity subsides.  
 Neutropenia .  Based on previous experience in patients after nonmyeloablative HCT, dose 
adjustments are not likely to occur because of hematopo ietic adverse effects, in particular 
neutropenia.  A thorough evaluation of neutropenia should occur including peripheral blood 
chimerism studies, marrow aspiration and review of marrow suppressive medications (e.g. 
bactrim, ganciclovir).  If all other pot ential causes of marrow toxicity are ruled out, dose 
adjustments will only be made for grade IV neutropenia that persists after day +28 post -
transplant. Dose reductions should be conservative (20%).  After day +21, the use of G -CSF will 
be permitted for ne utropenia. For severe toxicity related to MMF (grade IV neutropenia > 5 days 
refractory to G -CSF), MMF may be decreased and if neutropenia persists, MMF can be stopped.  
The MMF should be restarted at 20% reduced dose when the underlying toxicity subsides.   
 
 
 
G. Collection and infusions of Donor PBSC (see also  section 11.L ) 
 
MRD  
G-CSF administration to Donors  
From day -4 to day 0, all PBSC donors will receive G -CSF at a dose of 16 µg/kg/day for 5  
consecutive days. G -CSF will be administered by a subcutaneous daily injection. These doses  
will be administered before 10:00 a.m. each day in the Outpatient Department. The schedule of  
G-CSF administration and PBSC collections can only be ascertained once day 0 is identified . 
Once a treatment regimen sch edule has been fixed and the schedule of G -CSF administration  
and PBSC collections made, this has to be confirmed with the personnel in the apheresis room.  
Day 0 should be fixed on a Tuesday -Thursday.  
 
PBSC collection  
Donors will preferably undergo vein -to-vein collections or may receive an appropriate catheter  
inserted on or before day of apheresis. PBSCs will be collected in the afternoon of day -1, 
stored in the refrigerator at 4ºC overnight. A second collection will be performed the following  
afternoon and both collections will be transfused on day 0. If < 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg are  
collected an additional day of collection will be performed. If PBSCs cannot be collected by a  
vein-to-vein technique, a percutaneous Mahurkar catheter will be inserted. General procedures  
will include the use of a standard apheresis machine (COBE Spectra, Lakewood Colo.), and  
processing up to 16 liters of whole blood during the collection. The plan for PBSC collection is  
shown in Table 6 . 
 
Immunophenotyping of the G -PBMC product will be performed by the cryobiology laboratory and 
will include T -cells and their subsets, monocytes, and NK cells.

G-CSF Administration to Donors  
Timing of PBSC collection is prearranged through the NMDP. Day 0 should be fixed on a Monday -
Thursday when possible.  G -CSF will be administered by subcutaneous injection to the unrelated donor 
starting 5 days prior to the da y of HCT (see Table 7 ) as per NMDP protocol.  Donors will receive 
approximately 10 g/kg of G -CSF each day of mobilization.  A 12 -liter apheresis will be obtained on day 
–1 and possibly on day 0 for a total of 12 to 24 liters of apheresis collection that wi ll be infused on day 0.

PBSC Collection   
HCT scheduling and collection is arranged through the NMDP.  The schedule of G -CSF administration 
and collection of PBSC is determined as per NMDP protocol.  The physician responsible for 
hematopoietic cell collection will obtain informed consent from the donor.  
 
 Immunophenotyping of the G -PBMC product will be performed by the cryobiology laboratory and will 
include T -cells and their subsets, monocytes, and NK cells.   
  
 Collection of DLI.   Donor lymphocytes will be collected from unrelated donor G -PBMC  products prior 
to transplant for potential future use of DLI on other protocol or treatment plans. A portion of the PBSC 
product (10%) from unrelated donors will be frozen according to standard cryopreservation for DLI. 
Unrelated donor PBSC products will be frozen in an aliquot of 1.0 x 107 CD3+ cells/kg.  
 
MRD/URD  
 
      PBSC infusion  
All patients will receive unmodified PBSC infusion on day 0 of the treatment regimen (Refer to 
institutional practice guidelines for methods of infusion).  
   
H. ABO Incompatibility  
 All patients with ABO incompatibility should be evaluated and treated as according to the standard practice of 
the individual institution. Recommendations are provided in Appendix D .  It should be noted that two cases 
of recipient host red  blood cell hemolysis have been documented in patients with minor ABO mismatch with 
their donor36.  The suspected cause is donor anti -host hemagglutinin production from “passenger 
lymphocytes” in the donor PBSC that may expand post -transplant.  Therefore, these patients should be 
monitored and treated aggressively when there is any evidence of hemolysis.  
 
I. Post-transplant Growth Factors  
 Patients should in general not receive post -transplant growth factors during the first 21 days after HCT. 
Growth factors should not be given unless grade IV neutropen ia develops or persists past day +21 post -
transplant (ANC <500/L).  
 
 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-24- J. Infection Prophylaxis  
 Recommended prophylaxis for PCP, VZV, and HSV are listed in Appendix E  with the modification that 
PCP, VZV, and antifungal prophylaxis should be continued if the pa tient is receiving treatment for chronic 
GVHD.  Since antifungal prophylaxis strategies are evolving, patients may receive antifungal prophylaxis as 
per the standard practice of the treatment institution.  Standard CMV monitoring and prophylaxis should 
commence at the time of transplant and should continue until discontinuation of immunosuppression.  
Patients who reject their graft can discontinue this infection prophylaxis.  
 
K. Modifications of Immunosuppression for Low Donor T -cell Chimerism (impending graft  rejection) and 
Disease Progression  
 This section provides guidelines for management of patients with low donor chimerism and disease 
progression.  Those patients with significant progression of disease as defined in Table 8  will undergo more 
rapid reducti on of immunosuppression.  DLI will not be given for progressive or relapsed disease on this 
protocol, and patients with relapse or progression would be eligible for other ongoing DLI protocols or 
treatment plans.  Note that persistence of disease in itself  does not mandate accelerated taper of 
immunosuppression.  
 
1. Definition of mixed donor/host chimerism, engraftment, graft failure and rejection . For the purposes 
of this protocol, mixed chimerism  will be defined as the detection of donor T -cells (CD3+) and 
granulocytes (CD 33+), as a proportion of the total T -cell and granulocyte population, respectively, of 
greater than 5% and less than 95% in the peripheral blood.  Full donor chimerism is define d as > 95% 
donor CD3+ T -cells. Mixed or full donor chimerism will be evidence of donor engraftment.  Increasing 
donor chimerism  is defined as an absolute increase of 20% of CD3+ donor T -cells over the previous 
chimerism evaluation. Low donor chimerism is d efined as < 40% CD3+ donor T -cells any  time after 
HCT.  Low donor chimerism should always be confirmed with repeat peripheral blood T -cell and NK cell 
chimerism analysis.  A DNA -based assay that compares the profile of amplified fragment length 
polymorphis ms (ampFLP) (or FISH studies or VNTR) of the patient and donor will be used to quantitate 
chimerism of sorted peripheral blood T -cells (CD3+) and granulocytes (CD 33+). The same assay should 
be used in a given patient for repeated studies of chimerism.  Th is DNA -based analysis will also be 
performed on the whole nucleated cell fraction from marrow aspirates . Therapeutic decisions (e.g. 
pentostatin + DLI as per protocol 1825) will be made based on the results of sorted T -cell studies of 
peripheral blood.  For the purposes of this protocol, rejection  is defined as the inability to detect or loss of 
detection of greater than 5% donor T -cells (CD3+) as a proportion of the total T -cell population, 
respectively, after nonmyeloablative HCT.  Also for the purposes of  this protocol, graft failure  is defined 
as grade IV thrombocytopenia and neutropenia after day +21 that lasts > 2 weeks and is refractory to 
growth factor support.  
 
2. Evaluation of chimerism.   Patients will have peripheral blood and whole bone marrow evaluations for 
chimerism at various time points through one year post transplant. If the patient has not obtained > 95% 
donor chimerism in CD+3 by one year continue to evaluate through 5 years post  transplant as clinically 
necessary. Peripheral blood will be sorted to evaluate T -cell (CD+3), and NK cell (CD56) compartments. 
(See Patient Post Transplant Evaluation section for instructions and exceptions).   
 
3. Continuation of immunosuppression.   In the setting of low ( <40%) donor chimerism, 
immunosuppression should be continued or reinitiated at full dose so that DLI can be administered after 
pentostatin administration according to protocol 1825.  If there is disease progression in the setting of low 
donor chimerism, the algorithm for disease progression (below) should be followed.  Patients who reject 
their graft will not be offered DLI and may be eligible for a second allogeneic transplant on other 
protocols.  
 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-25- 4. Disease progression.   Evidence of disease progression (as defined in Table 8 ) will be an indication for 
therapeutic intervention.  In part, this will be dependent on where a patient is relative to the standard 
tapering schedule.  If the attending physician believes that the pat ient requires very aggressive therapy, 
the case will be presented to the institutions’ patient review committee (such as patient conference care at 
the FHCRC). Otherwise, priority should be given to rapid reduction of immunosuppression, option (a) 
below.  Therapeutic options include:  
 
 
Table 8.  Definition of Disease Progression . 
 
Disease  Progression  
MDS/ CMML   Any evidence by morphologic or flow cytometric evaluation of the bone 
marrow aspirate of an incremental increase in 5% blasts  
 
Agnogenic 
Myeloid 
Metaplasia / 
Atypical CML  
 
  Any evidence of blastic transformation.  
Polycythemia 
Vera and 
Essential 
Thrombocythemia  
  Progressive erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, or evidence of leukemic 
transformation.  
 
  
a. Early discontinuation of immunosuppression (prior to day +100) .  This should be considered the first 
therapeutic maneuver.  If there is no GVHD, MMF is to be stopped, and CSP tapered over 2 weeks.  
Bone marrow aspirate and blood chimerism studies will be performed when off immunos uppression 
after 2 weeks.  If there is no response to stopping immunosuppression and there is no GVHD, patients 
will be considered disease treatment failure.  DLI as treatment for disease progression or relapse will 
not be offered on this protocol, however  patients may treated according to other research protocols 
such as FHCRC protocol 1803. If there is progressive disease that requires therapy before 4 weeks, or 
progressive disease occurs despite onset  of GVHD, then patients can be treated off protocol wi th DLI 
or be considered for (c) or (d) below.     
 
b. Early discontinuation of immunosuppression (between day +100 and +180) .  If there is no GVHD, 
CSP is to be stopped. Bone marrow aspirate and blood chimerism studies will be performed when off 
immunosuppress ion after 2 weeks.  If there is no response to stopping immunosuppression, and there 
is no GVHD, patients will be considered as treatment fa ilure. DLI will not be offered for disease 
progression or relapse on this protocol but patients can be treated off p rotocol with DLI or be 
considered for (c) or (d) below.   
 
c. Treatment with chemotherapy .  Conventional chemotherapy should be considered in the setting of life 
threatening disease progression.  Patients in this situation would be considered treatment failur es. 
After therapy is completed chimerism should be evaluated and the administration of DLI off protocol 
considered.  
 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-26- d. Conventional allogeneic HCT.   This option should be discussed with the institutions’ patient review 
committee and the principal investigato r.  Patients who undergo conventional allogeneic HCT will be 
removed from this protocol at that time.  
 
L. Immunophenotyping of PBSC Administration Guidelines  
 Immunophenotyping of the PBSC product will be performed by the cryobiology laboratory and will in clude 
T-cells and their subsets, monocytes, and NK cells.  Unrelated donor PBSC products will be frozen in an 
aliquot of 1.0 x 107 CD3+ cells/kg (for use as DLI if needed).  Infusions of cryopreserved PBSC should be 
performed as per standard practice for o utpatient PBSC.  
 
12.  Assessment of Disease Responses (see also Appendix H)  
 
12.1 General guidelines  
 
(A) Any assessment of response must include a bone marrow aspirate. Patients with myelofibrosis will also 
require a biopsy.  
(B) All bone marrow aspirates must also have cytogenetics analysis. For some patients, there may be 
additional disease -specific FISH or PCR -assessed molecular markers that can be used to determine response.  
(C) Regimen -related toxicity, for example due to drug adverse effect, severe infection, or GVHD must be 
excluded as causes of peripheral blood cytopenias.  
 
12.2 Definition of Response  
 
12.2.1 Definition of Response: MDS/CMML  
 (A) Complete Response  
 Bone marrow rating: Normal maturation of all cell lines, without morphologic signific ant dysplasia

 Bone marrow rating: Normal maturation of all cell lines, without morphologic significant dysplasia 
and < 5% myeloblasts.  
 Peripheral blood rating: Hb >11 g/dL, neutrophils >1500/mm3, platelets >100 000/mm3, blast 0%, no 
dysplasia.  
 
(C) Progressive Disease  
 Any evidence by morphologic or flow cytometric evaluation of the bone marrow aspirate of an 
incremental increase in 5% blasts (e.g. if a patient is accrued with 9% blasts, HCT failure would be 
>14% blasts).  
 
12.2.2 Definition of Response: Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia38

-28- 13.  Patient and donor Evaluations  
 
A. Donor  
 
Related Donor  
Related donors will undergo standard evaluation for allogeneic stem cell donation, including:  
1. Complete history and physical examination.  
2. Lab tests: CBC with reticulocytes and platelet counts, serum sodium, potassium, chloride,  
CO2, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, LDH, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, AST, 
ALT, hepatitis screen, CMV, syphilis, HIV and HTLV I serologies and ABO Rh blood typing. I f the 
donor has antibodies against red cell antigens of the recipient, the titers will be determined. 
Cytotoxic crossmatch between patient and donor (HLA Laboratory) will be performed.  
3. CBC prior and after leukapheresis collection, plus daily while on G -CSF and if clinically indicated.  
4. A re-evaluation in the OPD after apheresis is completed.  
5. Attainment of a heparinized blood sample for subsequent determination of the host or donor origin 
of relapse to the cytogenetics lab or the clinical immunogenetics lab a s outlined in section 13.B.1.e.  
6. For females of child bearing age, serum pregnancy qualitative [PGSTAT] within 72 hours prior to 
initial dose of filgrastim (G -CSF).  Results must be available prior to filgrastim (G -CSF) dose.  
 
Unrelated Donor  
Unrelated don ors will undergo evaluation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell donation at the collection 
center by NMDP standard.  The attending physician of the collection center will review the results of the 
donor evaluation.  Evaluations typically include:  
1. Complete hi story and physical examination.  
2. Lab tests: CBC with reticulocytes and platelet counts, chemistries and LFT’s, hepatitis screen, 
CMV, syphilis, HIV and HTLV I serologies and ABO Rh blood typing. If the donor has antibodies 
against red cell antigens of the recipient, the titers will be determined. Cytotoxic crossmatch 
between patient and donor (HLA Laboratory) will be performed.  
3. No placement of a central line is necessary for G -CSF stimulated PBSC collection unless it is 
determined that the donor has poor v enous access.  If necessary, a temporary aphere sis (e.g. 
Mahurkar) catheter will be placed at the time of leukapheresis.  
4. CBC will be checked prior to and after leukapheresis collection, and daily while on G -CSF. CBCs 
will be checked thereafter if clinical ly indicated.  
5. The donor will be reevaluated the day after the apheresis is completed.

1. See Table 10 for disease specific post -transplant evaluation on Day +28, 56, 84, etc. This is 
a recommended evaluation schedule.  
 
Additionally, include the following for all diseases:  
2. CBC three times a week, or more often if clinically indicated, from day 0 until day +28, and twice 
weekly until 2 months post -transplant or later if clinically indicated  
3. Electrolytes ( sodium, potassium, chloride, CO 2, glucose, BUN, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, 
phosphorus, albumin)  three times a week and liver function tests  (ALT, AST, ALK, total bilirubin, 
direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, LD)  two times a week until day +28 and then every week.  
4. Evaluate at Day +84:  
A patient with an uncomplicated unrelated HCT would be discharged after the day +84 
workup and screenin g for chronic GVHD are completed and analyzed.  Since the patient may 
be discharged prior to starting CSP taper, instructions should be provided for preventing and 
detecting GVHD as per standard practice of collaborating institution.  
 
GVHD evaluation guide lines are as follows:  
 History and physical exam.  
 CBC/differential, serum IgG, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT and AST.  
 Skin biopsy.  
 Schirmer´s tear test.  
 Pulmonary function test.  
 Oral exam.  
 Dietician assessment.  
 Gynecological assessment (adult female).  
 
See Section 14. F for diagnosis and treatment guidelines of acute and chronic GVHD.  
 
 
5. Patients should be assessed  for the need of IVIG monitoring and replacement therapy per

14. Drugs and Toxicities  
  
A. Toxicity :  For the purposes of this protocol, toxicity will be graded using the modified NCI 
common toxicity scale ( Appendix P ). 
 
B. TBI:  TBI will be given in one 300 cGy (or 400 cGy in level 2  and 450 cGy in level 3) fraction 
from linear accelerator at a rate of 6 -7 cGy/min.  Dosimetry calculations are performed by the 
radiation therapist. At the 300 cGy, side effects are not expected.  Nevertheless, there may be fever, 
alopecia, parotitis, dia rrhea, reversible skin pigmentation, mucositis and late effects including 
cataract formation, growth retardation, pulmonary damage, carcinogenesis, and sterilization. Those 
side effects might be more frequently seen in patients given 400 cGy or 450 cGy.  
 
C. CSP:  See section 11.F.a  for information about administration and dosage adjustments. Side effects 
are generally reversible and may include renal insufficiency and failure, hypomagnesemia, 
paresthesias, tremor, seizures, visual disturbances, paresis, disorientation, depression, confusion, 
somnolence, coma, nausea, hypertension, hemolytic -uremic syndrome, hyperglycemia, 
gynecomastia, and hypertrichosis.  
 
D. MMF :  See section 11.F.b  for information about administration and dosage adjustments.  
 
Precautions:  MMF has been studied extensively among patients after nonmyeloablative HCT. 
Previous clinical studies in patients after allografting suggest that the principal adverse reactions 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-36- associated with the administration of MMF include nausea, vomiting, neutropen ia, diarrhea, and on 
one occasion bloody diarrhea. In the setting of marrow transplantation, several etiologic factors 
may contribute to alterations in gastrointestinal and hematologic parameters.  MMF has an 
increased incidence of  digestive system adverse  events, including GI tract ulceration, and 
hemorrhage (3%  of patients receiving MMF). GI tract perforations have rarely been observed. 
Most  patients in these studies were also on other drugs known to be associated with these  
complications. Up to 2% of pat ients receiving MMF for prevention of rejection  developed severe 
neutropenia (ANC <500). The development of neutropenia may  be related to MMF itself, 
concomitant medications, viral infections or some  combination of these causes. MMF dose 
adjustments will b e made if clinically indicated if in the opinion of the attending physician, no 
other cause is thought to be responsible for the abnormality.  These adjustments should be 
discussed with the principal investigator and documented in the medical records and t he clinical 
reporting form (CRF).  
 
E. Fludarabine :  The doses of fludarabine used in this protocol are nonmyeloablative, but do cause 
significant immunosuppression.  Fludarabine can lower the white blood cell count, in particular the 
CD4+ T -cells.  The im munosuppression observed with the use of fludarabine increases the risk of 
infection, which can be life threatening.  
 
F. GVHD :  After nonmyeloablative conditioning, the incidences of grades II, III and IV acute GVHD 
were 33%, 10% and 5%, respectively, in M RD recipients, and 42%, 9% and 3%, respectively, in 
URD recipients (Table 1). Acute GVHD has been readily controlled in most patients with high 
dose corticosteroids, but PUVA (psoralen activated ultraviolet light) has been required on occasion.  
Chronic ex tensive GVHD has occurred in 43% and 45% of MRD and URD recipients, 
respectively.  
 
 
1. Diagnosis :  Skin involvement will be assessed by biopsy with percentage of body surface area 
involved recorded. GI symptoms suspicious for GVHD will be evaluated by biopsy as 
indicated.  Acute GVHD and chronic GVHD will be graded according to established criteria 
(Appendix F and G ). 
 
2. Recommended Treatment : 
a. Patients developing  acute GVHD > grade II off immunosuppression or while on a 
CSP taper:  
1). CSP 5mg/kg PO q12hrs.  If there is concern of GI absorption use IV route 
(1.5mg/kg q12hrs).  
2). Prednisone (2mg/kg/day) is to be added if there is no response by 72 hours or 
progression of GVHD during the 24 hours after the start of CSP 6.0mg/kg 
POq12hrs.  Patients who respond to s teroids after 10 to 14 days of treatment, 
should begin a 6 -week steroid taper.  
3). Patients may also be eligible for institutional trials of GVHD therapy.  
b. Patients who develop acute GVHD > grade II prior to day +100:  
1). Patients who develop acute GVHD > grade II while on full dose MMF should 
receive prednisone (2mg/kg/day) or intravenous equivalent.  When steroids are 
tapered to 0.5mg/kg PO QD then an MMF taper should be initiated.  In the 
absence of a GVHD flare, the MMF and prednisone tapers should con tinue until 
completion.  If nausea and/or vomiting prevent the oral administration of MMF, 
MMF should be administered intravenously at 15mg/kg q12hrs IV, or q8hrs if 
prior to Day + 28. Patients who respond to steroids after 10 to 14 days of 
treatment, shou ld begin a 6 -week steroid taper.  
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-37- 2). Patients who develop acute GVHD > grade II while not receiving full dose 
MMF should receive prednisone (2mg/kg/day) or intravenous equivalent. MMF 
need not be restarted at full dose.  
3). Patients may also be eligible fo r institutional trials of GVHD therapy.  
c. Patients with clinical extensive chronic GVHD: CSP 5.0mg/kg PO q12hrs and 
prednisone 1mg/kg QD or eligible protocols at the time.  The patient should receive 
antibiotic prophylaxis with daily double strength Bactrim.   
d. Patients off immunosuppression who develop concurrent manifestations of GVHD 
that satisfy criteria for acute GVHD > grade II (e.g. erythematous rash, diarrhea, 
hyperbilirubinemia) and have stigmates of clinical extensive chronic GVHD (e.g. 
lichenoid oral  changes, ocular sicca, scleroderma, bronchiolitis obliterans, 
contractures), should receive prolonged immunosuppressive therapy similar to that 
for clinical extensive chronic GVHD.  
 
G. Myelosuppression  
Grade IV myelosuppression will be defined as a decrease in ANC to <500/µL and/or platelet count 
to  20,000/µL.  If myelosuppression occurs, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be 
performed to exclude disease progression. Samples should be sent for ch imerism analysis by a 
DNA -based assay that compares the profile of amplified fragment length polymorphisms 
(ampFLP) (or FISH studies or VNTR) . Myelosuppression may occur in this patient population 
for a number of reasons such as direct toxic effect of drug s (MMF, ganc iclovir etc.), rejection, 
relapse or after DLI.  
 
Patients with myelosuppression may be managed as follows:  
1. Suspected MMF toxicity :  refer to sections 11.F.b.4 Guidelines for MMF dose adjustment  
above for management recommendations.  
2. Suspected  ganciclovir toxicity:   consider changing to foscarnet.  
3. Patients who are > 21 days after HCT with a hypoplastic marrow and an ANC of <750/µL may 
receive G -CSF.  
4. Thrombocytopenic patients will receive platelet transfusion as per standard care.  
 
15. Records  
Clinical records will be maintained as confidentially as possible by all collaborating institutions. 
Collection of Case Report Forms (CRF) at standard intervals is the primary method of collecting data 
from collaborating centers.  Clinical Statistics at FH CRC maintains a patient database to allow storage 
and retrieval of patient data collected from a wide variety of sources.  The principal investigator will 
ensure that data collected conform to all established guidelines for coding collection, key entry and  
verification.  These data are then entered into a secure dedicated database operated by a data manager.  
Any publication or presentation will refer to patients by a unique patient number and not by name to 
assure patient confidentiality.  The licensed med ical records department, affiliated with the institution 
where the patient receives medical care, maintains all original inpatient and outpatient chart documents.  
 
At the FHCRC, patient research files are kept in a locked room.  They are maintained by the FHCRC 
data collection staff that is supervised by an A.R.T. Access is restricted to personnel authorized by the 
Division of Clinical Research.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-38- 16. Statistical Consideration and Termination of Study  
 
The primary objective of this protocol is to evalu ate whether a more intense but still nonmyeloablative 
conditioning regimen can reduce the combined rate of graft rejection and disease progression (HCT failure) 
in this group of MDS and CMML patients, while maintaining an acceptable rate of nonrelapse mort ality.  
Previous protocols with standard nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens have yielded HCT failure rates 
of 0.30 -0.60.  For purposes of this protocol HCT failure will be defined as graft rejection (defined as < 5% 
donor T -cell chimerism) or disease p rogression (see table 8 page 25) within 200 days of transplant.  
 
Dose escalation will be carried out independently in two groups of patients:  
Arm A – patients with MPD, MDS -RA/RARS, or PNH  
Arm B – patients with MDS -RAEB or CMML  
 
In each arm, up to 24 patients will be accrued to each TBI dose level, in groups of 6 patients, with an 
escalation rule triggered for excessive HCT failure.  If 24 patients are successfully enrolled at a TBI dose 
level without triggering the escalation rul e for HCT failure (or other stopping rule), then that dose level will 
be considered a success and accrual will be closed for that arm.  The proposed TBI dose levels are:  
 
Dose Level 1) 300 cGy TBI + fludarabine 30 /m2/day IV  x 3 days  
Dose Level 2) 400 cGy T BI + fludarabine 30 /m2/day IV x 3 days  
Dose Level 3) 450 cGy TBI + fludarabine 30 /m2/day IV  x 3 days  
 
Dose escalation  rules  will be imposed for:  
 HCT failure >20%  at day 200 on Arm A  or Arm B  
 
Stopping rules  will be imposed for:  
 NRM of > 25% at day 200 on Arm A  
 NRM of >  35% at day 200 on Arm B  
 
Enrollment to a dose level will occur in groups of 6 patients.  Escalation to the next dose level will occur if 
there exists reasonable evidence that the true rate of HCT failure exceeds 0.20.  Reasonable evidence wi ll 
be taken to mean that the lower bound of a one -sided 80% confidence interval for the true rate is greater 
than 0.20.  Operationally, this rule will be triggered if 3 or more of 6, 5 or more of 12, 6 or more of 18, or 7 
or more of 24 patients  experience HCT failure.  Accrual may continue pending evaluability of enrolled 
patients; however, at any point the escalation rule is triggered the outcome of subsequently enrolled 
patients will not override it.  The operating characteristics of this escalation rule are provided in the table 
below.  
 
Stopping rules will also be applied in each arm for non -relapse mortality within 200 days of transplant.  
Accrual to a dose level will stop if there exist reasonable evidence that the true rate of nonrelapse mortality 
exceeds 0.25.  Reasonable evidence will be taken to mean that the lower bound of a one -sided 80% 
confidence interval for the true rate is greater than 0.25.  Operationally, this rule will be triggered if 3 or 
more of 6, 5 or more of 12, 7 or more of 18, or 9 o r more of 24  patients experience NRM.  Accrual may 
continue pending evaluability of enrolled patients; however, at any point the stopping rule is triggered the 
outcome of subsequently enrolled patients will not override it.  If the stopping rule is trigger ed, then dose 
escalation is not permitted and consequently accrual to that arm of the protocol will be closed. The 
operating characteristics of this escalation rule are provided in the table below.

Additional accrual  to Arm A  
If ARM A completes accrual of 24 patients at a dose level, up to 12 additional patients may be accrued at 
the same dose level while accrual to Arm B continues.  Stopping rules for non -relapse mortality will 
continue to be monitored.  Additional stopping po ints will be 10 NRM deaths in 30 or fewer patients and 
12 NRM deaths in 36 or fewer patients.  
 
 
Revised stopping rule for Arm B  
The initial cohort of 6 patients enrolled into Arm B experienced 3 non -relapse deaths before day 200, 
triggering the original s topping rule.  Of the 5 patients evaluable for disease response (one patient died day 
19 from Human metapneumovirus and, thus, was not evaluable), all 5 engrafted with day 28 CD3 
chimerism ranging from 64 -89% and 4 of 5 patients achieved a complete remissi on.  After reviewing recent 
data with similar patient populations ( 26 patients with CMML/RAEB ), it was determined that the original 
threshold rate of 0.25 for non -relapse mortality was too conservative.  Although a rate of 0.25 accurately 
reflects the obse rved NRM in these patients, it does not accommodate the increase in NRM that might 
occur if better engraftment and disease control is successfully achieved, thus placing more patients at risk 
for NRM.  Specifically, 17 patients (65%) relapsed or progressed  108 (28 -1585) days after HCT, while 5 
(19%) rejected their grafts 80 (14 -127) days after HCT. All patients with graft rejection eventually 
progressed. Consequently, accrual to Arm B will be restarted with a revised stopping rule based on a 
threshold rate of 0.35 for non -relapse mortality.  The  outcome of the initial 6 patients enrolled at the first 
dose level in Arm B will carry forward and be included in the evaluation of the stopping rule after 
restarting.   Escalation and stopping rules for Arm A are unc hanged.  
 
The revised stopping rule for Arm B will be triggered if 4 or more of 6, 7 or more of 12, 9 or more of 18, or 
11 or more of 24 patients experience NRM before day 200.  The operating characteristics of this stopping 
rule are provided in the table b elow.

stopping  in the restarted Arm B, given that  3 of 6 patients  already have experienced NRM by day  200.  The 
other percent applies if the stopping rule is applied to a higher dose level  within Arm B.  
 
If a cohort of 24 patients is completed without excessive HCT failure, then no more than 6 HCT failures 
will have occurred.  Nominally this would mean that we could be 80% confident that the true rate of HCT 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-40- failure was less than 35%; howev er, because of the continuous monitoring and escalation rule for HCT 
failure, the final estimated failure rate will be an underestimate of the true failure rate.  
 
Secondary endpoints to be evaluated will include:  
 the rate of relapse/progression in patients  with MPD or MDS -RA and those with CMML or 
MDS -RAEB.  
 the probability of PFS in patients with MPD or MDS -RA and those with CMML or MDS -
RAEB.  
 the kinetics of donor engraftment.  
 the incidence of infections.  
 
17. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
A. FHCRC Protocol 2056 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
1. Monitoring the progress of trials and the safety of participants  
Protocol 2056 is a multi -institutional clinical trial that is monitored by the principal 
investigator (PI), Dr. Sandmaier, a Data Safety and M onitoring Board (DSMB), the Data and 
Safety  Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB).  The PI 
reviews outcome data with the protocol mentor for each individual patient at a minimum of 3 
months after unrelated donor HCT and the u pdated data are presented at Mixed Chimerism 
Meetings (includes co -investigators).  
 
Please see Appendix I  for definitions of adverse events, serious adverse events (SAE) and 
serious and unexpected events as well as mechanisms for reporting these events. S AEs are 
reported to the trial coordinator.  The trial coordinators at collaborating centers or the local PIs 
will report SAEs within 10 days to the coordinating center (FHCRC). The SAEs report is 
reviewed by Dr. Sandmaier.  If the SAE meets the FHCRC  exped ited criteria for reporting then 
an official signed report is submitted to the FHCRC Institutional Review Office (IRO).  All 
deaths, regardless of the cause, are reported to the IRB. Protocol 2056 has a dedicated 
independent DSMB responsible for monitoring  patient safety on this clinical trial.  The DSMB 
will meet at six -month intervals for this protocol and all outcome data is reviewed including all 
adverse events and SAEs reported to the coordinating center (FHCRC) along with those 
officially reported to the FHCRC IRO.  The DSMB confirms whether the trial has met any 
stopping rules and reviews any patient safety problems necessitating discontinuation of the 
trial.  A report from the DSMB is submitted to the FHCRC IRB as well as the trial 
coordinators/local  PIs of this protocol.  The DSMB will discontinue the review of outcomes 
when this protocol is closed to accrual. Furthermore, the FHCRC also has a DSMC that 
reviews the progress of the protocol with respect to the monitoring plan at the time of each 
annua l renewal.  As with initial review, annual IRB review and approval is also required.  
  
Flow of information concerning clinical trial participants originates with the clinicians and 
nurses in the clinic or referring clinicians at other institutions and is transmitted to the trial 
coordinator and data manager.  At the FHCRC, health care providers and rotating attending 
physicians assess patients and record their observations regarding toxicity and response 
outcomes in the medical record .  This documentation is extracted by the study nurse at 100 
days after HCT via chart review and collection of copies of source documents and entered into 
a hard copy or electronic Case Report Form (CRF) by approximately day +140 post transplant.  
The PI review s the official CR F and primary source documents.  When the CRFs are verified, 
they are signed by the PI .  Thus, multiple health care providers provide independent 
observations and participate in monitoring this trial. The PI may be a clinician for some 
patients entered on this trial.  However, assessments are the sum total of the primary health 
care provider (fellow or physician assistant), floor or outpatient nurse and the PI or other 
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-41- attending clinician involved with the patient averting possible conflict of interest havi ng the PI 
as the attending clinician for protocol patients.  If determination of adverse events is 
controversial, co -investigators will convene on an ad hoc basis as necessary to review the 
primary data and render a decision.  
 
Protocol 2056 will be a mult i-institutional protocol. All collaborating centers sign an 
agreement with the FHCRC stating that data generated from patients from the protocol will be 
reported accurately in a timely manner to the FHCRC.  All centers have an IRB that reviews 
the protocol  and that the local PIs contact when an adverse event on the protocol occurs.  Most 
of the centers have internal auditing mechanisms that assure accurate assessment of clinical 
outcomes.  Clinical outcome data are summarized and transmitted from collaborat ing centers 
as CRFs.  When possible, primary source documents regarding patient outcomes are collected 
with patients’ names removed and replaced by Unique Patient Numbers (UPNs).  The CRFs 
are generated from the collaborating centers at defined time points  (100 days, 6 months, and 
yearly).  They are reviewed by local PI, signed, and sent for encoding in the database.  
 
 
2. Plans for assuring compliance with requirements regarding the reporting of Serious Adverse 
Events SAEs  
The adverse event reporting in th is multi -institutional clinical trial will follow an adapted 
version of the FHCRC Guidelines for SAE reporting.  These guidelines (attached in Appendix 
I.) detail the expedited reporting requirements, definitions of particular events.  All SAEs  that 
meet e xpedited criteria  are reported to the IRO within 10 days by the investigator, trial 
coordinator, or research nurse upon learning of the event.  A completed SAE report form, 
signed by the PI, must be received by the IRO within 10 calendar days.  The PI’s pr otocol 
mentor reviews all SAEs and annual reports at the time of submission.  For patients being 
cared for at the FHCRC, health care providers communicate with the PI, trial coordinator or 
research nurses as events occur triggering subsequent reporting.  F or patients not being cared 
for at FHCRC the outside facilities communicate with the PI, trial coordinator, or research 
nurse for these reporting purposes.  All other deaths and expected serious adverse events are 
reported to the IRB at the time of annual renewal and at the biannual mixed chimerism 
meeting.  The PI for a study is responsible for this reporting and the IRO assures adverse event 
reporting on an annual basis.  The PI in the annual application for grant continuation will 
summarize reports of to xicities.  Furthermore, an additional safeguard for adverse event 
analysis and reporting in this protocol is provided by stopping rules and interim analysis after 
every 10th patient is enrolled. All collaborating PIs have fulfilled all NIH requirements for  
training in human subjects protection.  
                               
3.  Plans for assuring that any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of an NCI -
funded clinical trial is reported to the NCI grant program director responsible for the  grant  
This clinical research trial uses commercial agents and there is no associated Investigational 
New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE).  Any temporary or permanent 
suspension, as determined by the PI, IRB, or DSMC , of this clinical research trial will be 
reported to the NCI grant program director by the PI.  
  
2056.00  
 
FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-42- 4.  Plans for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance  
Collaborating sites send signed consents, eligibility forms, and CRFs with source 
documents demonstrating eligibility, treatment, and serious adverse events (if applicable) 
to the study staff. These are reviewed for eligibility, adherence to the protocol, accuracy, 
and completeness by the study staff. Queries are sent to the collaborating investigators if 
CRFs are inaccurate or incomplete.  
 
The study is monitored under the FHCRC Monitoring Plan. The FHCRC Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan details the full sc ope and extent of monitoring and provides for 
immediate action in the event of the discovery of major deviations.

ABO INCOMPATIBILITY  
 
Red Blood Cell - Incompatibility (Major):  
Occasional patients may have antibodies directed against red blood cell antigens found on the donor's cells.  
These are generally ABO or Rh antigens, although incompatibility with other red cell antigens identified by 
donor -recipient crossmatch may occur.  Although the volume of red blood cells (RBC) in most PBMC 
products will only be 2 -5% of the product volume before infusion, the small quantity may cause a 
hemolytic transfusion reaction.  According to the FHCRC policy it is generally acceptable to infuse a 
volume of about 10ml RBCs per product. If the recipient shows an anti -donor titer of  1:32 or the RBC 
volume is greater than 10ml (or >20ml in two products combined) the PBMC components should be RBC 
depleted by Starch Sedimentation (flowsheet below). Refer to the Clinical Coordinator's Patient 
Information Sheet for instructions regarding management of a specific patient.  
 
Post transplant blood component support will be according to Standard Practice Guidelines.  
 
Timing: Every attempt should be made to i nfuse red cell depleted PBMC products within 2 hours of 
depletion.  
 
Expected Results:  Red blood cell depleted PBMC products will contain < 10ml of red blood cells and  
90% nucleated cell recovery.  
 
Red Blood Cell - Incompatibility (Minor):  Occasional donors may have antibodies directed against red 
blood cell antigens (ABO, Rh, or other antigen system) found on the recipient's cells. The risk of hemolysis 
of recipient red cells immediately after transplant is not of very much clinical import.  Due to the high 
number of lymphocytes in the PBMC inoculum, recipients may be at much greater risk for a delayed type 
of hemolysis that can be severe. PBMC products contain < 200ml of plasma according to FHCRC policy 
and no deleterious effects have been o bserved so far. However, if donors show an anti -recipient titer  
1:256, the PBMC component should be plasma depleted (see flowsheet below). Refer to the Clinical 
Coordinator's Patient Information Sheet for instructions regarding management of a specific p atient.  
 
Post transplant blood component support will be according to Standard Practice Guidelines.  
 
Timing:  Every attempt should be made to infuse plasma -depleted PBMC within 2 hours of depletion.  
 
Expected Results:  The plasma depletion should not affec t the nucleated cell recovery.  
 
Red Blood Cell – Bidirectional Incompatibility:  Patients undergoing transplants for bidirectional RBC 
incompatibility should be managed according to both algorithms shown below. Most red cell depletion 
techniques also deple te plasma from the PBMC component with no additional cell loss.  Refer to the 
Clinical Coordinator's Patient Information Sheet for instructions regarding management of a specific 
patient.  
 
Post transplant blood component support will be according to Standar d Practice Guidelines.

CHRONIC GRAFT -VERSUS -HOST DISEASE (GVHD)  
Chronic GVHD in allogeneic transplant recipients resembles autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma, 
Sjogren syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, lichen planus, wasting syndrome, bronchiolitis obliterans 
among others manifestations (see below).  Approximately 50% of patients will develop this complication 
within 6 months after the transplant despite continued treatment with immunosuppressive medications.  
Close monitoring is recommended during the first 2 years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation so that 
appropriate treatment can be instituted promptly in patients who develop chronic GV HD.  Debilitation, 
joint contractures and profound immunosuppression resulting in recurrent bacterial infections are 
prominent characteristics of untreated chronic GVHD.  
 
A. Classification of Chronic GVHD  
The purpose of this classification is to identify patients with cGVHD who need long -term systemic 
immunosuppression according to clinical and laboratory findings and risk factors at the time of initial 
diagnosis. In addition, a morbidity scale has been developed to help grade the severity of manifestation  of 
chronic GVHD (Appendix D) at the time of diagnosis, when changes in treatment are made and when 
assessing treatment response.  
1. Chronic GVHD not requiring systemic treatment: mild abnormalities involving a single site, 
with platelet count >100,000 and  no steroid treatment at the onset of chronic GVHD  
a) Oral abnormalities consistent with cGVHD, a positive skin or lip biopsy, and no other 
manifestations of cGVHD.  
b) Mild liver test abnormalities (alkaline phosphatase ≤2 x upper limit of normal, AST or A LT ≤3 
x upper limit of normal and total bilirubin ≤1.6) with positive skin or lip biopsy, and no other 
manifestations of cGVHD.  
c) Less than 6 papulosquamous plaques, macular -papular or lichenoid rash involving <20% of 
body surface area (BSA), dyspigmentat ion involving <20% BSA, or erythema involving <50% 
BSA, positive skin biopsy, and no other manifestations of cGVHD.  
d) Ocular sicca (Schirmer’s test ≤5mm with no more than minimal ocular symptoms), positive 
skin or lip biopsy, and no other manifestations o f cGVHD.  
e) Vaginal or vulvar abnormalities with positive biopsy, and no other manifestations of cGVHD.  
2. Chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment: more severe abnormalities or involvement of 
multiple sites, or platelet count <100,000, or steroid treatme nt at the onset of chronic GVHD  
a) Involvement of two or more organs with symptoms or signs of cGVHD, with biopsy 
documentation of cGVHD in any organ.  
b) ≥15% base line body weight loss not due to other causes, with biopsy documentation of 
cGVHD in any organ.  
c) Skin involvement more extensive than defined for clinical limited cGVHD, confirmed by 
biopsy.  
d) Scleroderma or morphea.  
e) Onycholysis or onychodystrophy thought to represent cGVHD, with documentation of cGVHD 
in any organ.  
f) Decreased range of  motion in wrist or ankle extension due to fasciitis caused by cGVHD.  
g) Contractures thought to represent cGVHD.  
h) Oral involvement with functional impairment, refractory to topical treatment.  
i) Vaginal involvement with functional impairment, refractory  to topical treatment.  
j) Bronchiolitis obliterans not due to other causes.  
k)    Positive liver biopsy; or abnormal liver function tests not due to other causes with alkaline 
phosphatase >2 x upper limit of normal, AST or ALT >3 x upper limit of normal, o r total 
bilirubin >1.6, and documentation of cGVHD in any organ.  
l)  Positive upper or lower GI biopsy.  
m)  Fasciitis or serositis thought to represent cGVHD and not due to other causes

FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-56- B. Physical manifestations of Chronic GVHD  
Manifestations that are di stinctive for chronic GVHD can begin before day +100 after the transplant, and 
manifestations that are typical of acute GVHD can persist long after day +100.  For this reason, the 
differential diagnosis between acute and chronic GVHD cannot be made solely according to the time 
interval from transplant. The diagnosis of chronic GVHD requires at least one manifestation that is 
distinctive for chronic GVHD ( identified by italic print below ) as opposed to acute GVHD. In all cases, 
infection and others causes mu st be 
ruled out in the differential diagnosis of chronic GVHD.  
 
Karnofsky or Lansky Clinical Performance scores <60%, ≥15% weight loss, and recurrent infections are 
usually signs of clinical extensive chronic GVHD.  Abnormalities that could indicate chroni c GVHD are 
categorized by organ system are listed below ( italic print identifies manifestation more distinct of chronic 
GVHD):  
Skin Erythema, dryness, pruritis, macular -papular or urticarial rash, pigmentary changes (i.e., 
hyperpigmentation, vitiligo), mottling, papulosquamous or lichenoid plaques, 
hyperkeratosis, exfoliation (icht hyosis), nodules, scleroderma, morphea (one or several 
circumscribed, indurated and shiny lesions) . The extent of skin involvement and the skin 
thickness score for patients wit h scleroderma needs to be recorded at the time of 
diagnosis, when changes in treatment are made and when assessing treatment response. 
Medical photos are also useful for assessing the extent of skin involvement and response 
to treatment.  
Nails  A. Ridging, on ychodystrophy, onycholysis  
Hair Premature graying (scalp hair, eyelashes, eyebrows), thinning scalp hair, alopecia, 
decreased body hair  
Mouth  Dryness, burning, gingivitis, mucositis, striae, dryness, atrophy, erythema, lichenoid 
changes, ulcers, labial a trophy or pigmentary changes, tightness around the mouth, 
sensitivity to acidic, strong flavors, heat or cold, tooth decay  
Eyes Dryness, burning, blurring, gritty eyes, photophobia, pain  
Vagina/vulva  Dryness, dyspareunia, stricture or stenosis, erythema,  atrophy or lichenoid changes not 
induced by ovarian failure or other causes  
Liver  Jaundice and elevated liver function tests not due to other causes (see laboratory tests)  
Lung  Bronchiolitis obliterans (see diagnostic indicators), cough, wheezing, dyspn ea on 
exertion, history of recurrent bronchitis or sinusitis  
GI Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption, dysphagia, odynophagia  
Myofascial  Stiffness and tightness with restriction of movement, occasionally with swelling, pain, 
cramping, erythema and induration, most commonly affecting the forearms, wrists and 
hands, ankles, legs and feet, inability to extend the wrists without flexing the fingers or 
the elbows, contractures  
Muscle  B. Proximal muscle weakness, cramping  
Skeletal  Arthralgia of large proximal girdle joints and sometimes smaller joints  
Serosal  Unexplained effusions involving the pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal cavities not due to 
venocclusive disease of the liver, cardiac insufficiency, malignancy, infection, GM -CSF 
toxici ty or other causes

FHCRC Current Version  03/0 3/2016  
-57- C. Laboratory Testing and Diagnostic Indicators of Chronic GVHD  
 
Eye Schirmer’s test with a mean value ≤ 5 mm at 5 minutes, or values of 6 -10 mm in patients 
who have sicca symptoms, or keratitis detected by slit lamp examination  
Liver  Elevated liver function tests not due to other causes (alkaline phosphatase ≥2 x upper 
limit, of normal, AST or ALT >3 x upper limit of normal or total serum bilirubin ≥1.6)  
Lung  New obstructive lung defect defined as an FEV 1 <80% of predicted with either an FEF 
25-75 <65% of predicted or RV >120% of predicted, or a decrease of FEV 1/FVC by 
>12% within a period of less than 1 year, though not to be caused by an infectious 
process, asthma or recurrent aspiration from the sinuses or from gastroesop hageal 
reflux. In the absence of GVHD in any other organ, the diagnosis of bronchiolitis 
obliterans requires negative microbiological tests from bronchoalveolar lavage, 
evidence of air trapping by high resolution end -expiratory and end -inspiratory CAT scan  
of the lungs, or confirmation by thoracoscopic biopsy.  
Esophagus  Esophageal web formation, stricture or dysmotility demonstrated by barium swallow, 
endoscopy or manometry  
Intestine  Endoscopic findings of mucosal edema and erythema or focal erosions with  histological 
changes of apoptotic epithelial cells and crypt cell drop out. Patients with unresolved 
acute GVHD may have more severe intestinal mucosal lesions including ulcers and 
mucosal sloughing.  
Muscle  Elevated CPK or aldolase, EMG findings consiste nt with myositis with biopsy revealing 
no other etiological process  
Blood  Thrombocytopenia (usually 20,000 -100,000/
 l), eosinophilia (> 0.4 x 103/uL), 
hypogammaglobulinemia. Hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibodies occur in some 
cases.  
 
D. Guidelines fo r Treatment of Chronic GVHD after allogeneic HSCT  
We strongly recommend that you consult the LTFU office before beginning treatment for chronic GVHD 
and before making changes in immunosuppressive treatment. Clinical trials should always be considered 
becau se current standard therapies are associated with high morbidity and decreased survival for patients 
with high risk chronic GVHD  
 
Standard treatment of chronic GVHD usually begins with administration of glucocorticoids (1mg/kg/day) 
followed by taper to ev entually reach an alternate -day regimen, with or without daily cyclosporine or 
tacrolimus (FK506). Other medications used for treatment of corticosteroid -resistant chronic GVHD are 
summarized on the next page. Telephone consultation with the LTFU medical t eam is available to you, 
seven days a week, to discuss appropriate treatment and provide other follow up recommendations. In 
addition to immunosuppressive treatment, antibiotic prophylaxis for encapsulated  
bacterial infections and PCP must be given to all patients being treated for chronic GVHD  
(see Appendix E ). 
 
The duration of systemic immunosuppressive treatment of chronic GVHD varies but requires at least one 
year of therapy. Approximately 80% of patients require systemic immunosuppressive for 2 years and 40% 
of them requires therapy for at least 4 years.

STUDY COORDINATOR’S MANUAL  
 
 
I.  Introduction  
The mixed chimerism protocols have been opened to multiple sites to increase the referral base and accrual. 
Because of this expansion of collaborators, the data collection procedures are being revised. The procedure 
manual was created to assure consistency of data reporting across the centers and to assure compliance with 
regulations. General expectations of collaborators are that they will comply with appropriate regulatory  
requirements, specified protocol requirements, and provide outcome data.  
 
The manual translates working procedures for study coordination. Its goal is to describe the procedures 
with sufficient clarity to ensure that all study centers will use the same pr ocedures and follow -up schedules 
for participant data management and reporting. Changes to the manual and relevant forms will be made as 
soon as practical and will become effective on receipt of the revised procedures at the study centers, unless 
otherwise  noticed.  
 
II. Institutional Review Board Review of Protocols and Modifications  
All research protocols proposed for use that involves human subjects must be reviewed and approved by 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to implementation. New protocols wi ll undergo review at the 
FHCRC IRB and then will be distributed to sites that wish to participate for their IRB’s review. For Centers 
that have a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA), formal collaboration includes submission of a form 310 and a 
copy of the IRB app roved protocol and consent forms to the FHCRC.  For sites without a FWA, an FWA 
form needs to be filed. Once the paperwork is submitted to the Office for Human Research Protection, the 
approval process can take up to a couple of months, and must be complet ed before collaboration on a 
protocol can begin.  
 
In addition, all amendments and/or revisions to on -going, approved activities must be submitted for review 
and approved prior to implementation at an institution.  No revisions may be implemented at outsid e 
institutions without the prior approval of the FHCRC Principal Investigator.  The FHCRC and the local 
site’s IRB must review all protocol activities at least once annually. This must be done within 365 days of 
the last review regardless of the policies o f the institution. A copy of annual renewal approvals must be 
received for collaboration to continue for the next year.  
 
III. Registrations  
Collaborating Institutions : The principal investigator of the collaborating institution who will register the 
patient wit h the FHCRC will identify eligible patients. Registration will include completion of the 
eligibility checklist/demographic form. This form will be faxed (206 -667-5378) prior to treatment 
initiation. Patients should be registered prior to treatment initiati on for valid registration  
 
IV. Reporting Adverse Events  
The following guidelines are the minimum serious adverse event (SAE) reporting guidelines for Category 1 
and 2 studies conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.   
Expedited Reporting Requir ements   
All unexpected and serious adverse events which may be due to study treatment or intervention must  
be reported to the FHCRC Institutional Review Office as soon as possible but within at least 10 
calendar days of the investigator learning of the eve nt.

Appendix I (cont’d)  
STUDY COORDINATOR’S MANUAL  
 
Definitions  
Adverse Event  - Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event  can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not 
considered related t o the medicinal product.  
 
Life-threatening Adverse Event   – Any adverse event that places the patient or subject, in view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.  Study toxicities are graded using the adapted 
NCI Common Toxicity  Criteria (where appropriate use the criteria for transplant patients.)  All Grade 4 
(life-threatening) toxicities occurring between start of conditioning to day  200 that meet expedited 
reporting requirements must be reported as soon as possible but within  at least 10 calendar days of the 
investigator learning of the event.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  – An adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the 
applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or 
package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  If applicable product 
information is not available, such as for studies that do not involve pharmaceutical products or devices, an 
unexpected adverse ev ent is an adverse event that was not described in the study protocol or informed 
consent.  
 
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  – Any adverse event occurring that results in any of the following 
outcomes:   
 Death – start of conditioning to day  200, regardless of ca use. 
 life-threatening adverse event (see above).  
 persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
 congenital anomaly.  
 requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
 
Hospitalization, in general, will not be considered a serious adverse e vent as approximately half of 
evaluable MRD patients AND the majority of evaluable URD patients receiving nonmyeloablative 
transplants were hospitalized.  Hospitalization will be considered a serious adverse event if it fulfills the 
criteria for a serious and unexpected adverse event as described above.  
 
To ensure no confusion or misunderstanding exist of the differences between the terms “serious” and 
“severe,” which are not synonymous the following note of clarification is provided:  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) or a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as severe headache).  This is not the same as “seri ous,” which is based on patient/event outcome or 
action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations.

Attribution  - The FHCRC designation for the determination of whether an adverse event is related to a 
medical product, treatment or procedure will be as follows:  
 Related  – includes adverse events that are definitely, probably, or possibly related to the medical 
treatment or procedure.  
 Not Related  – includes adverse events are doubtfully related or clearly not related to the medical 
treatment or procedure.  
 
The FHCRC Serio us Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form should be completed for all adverse events that 
meet the expedited reporting requirements.   All available information should be submitted but it is 
acceptable to fax an incomplete report form at the initial report.  A co mpleted report should be faxed as 
soon as possible but must be received within 10 calendar days.  
 
It is the responsibility of the FHCRC Principal Investigator to notify the sponsor, NIH, FDA or other 
agencies of serious adverse events as required in the pr otocol.  
 
Serious adverse events that do not meet the requirement for expedited reporting (not related to study 
treatment or expected) will be reported to the IRB as part of the annual renewal of the protocol.  
 
FHCRC is acting as the Coordinating Center for  this multi -institutional study, and it is the responsibility of 
the FHCRC Principal Investigator (or designee) to complete the FHCRC Serious Adverse Event Report for 
all serious adverse events that meet the expedited reporting requirements that are receiv ed from the 
participating sites.   
 
Procedure for Reporting Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events from Participating Sites  
Regulations defining the responsibilities for reporting serious and unexpected adverse reactions are defined 
above.  Serious and unex pected adverse events must be reported to the FHCRC Investigator within 10 days  
of learning of the event. This includes patient deaths  (serious, unexpected, and related/possibly related) , 
regardless of cause, occurring start of conditioning to day  200 post -transplant procedure.   The immediate 
telephone report must be followed by faxed comments to the FHCRC Trial Coordinator at (206) 667 -5378. 
This will be followed by detailed written report (See Appendix J ) within 10 working days.  The report must 
include t he date and time of onset, severity and duration of the event, the relationship to the study, the 
treatment given and eventual outcome.  Follow -up information to a SAE report must be submitted as soon 
as the relevant information is available.  
 
Obligation of Investigators  
All grade 3 or 4 adverse events (or highly unusual grade 2 adverse events), which occur between start of 
conditioning to day  100 during the study will be recorded on the Case Report Form ( Appendix M) .  These 
adverse events which are observ ed by the Investigator or reported by the patient, whether or not attributed to 
the study, will be reported on the Case Report Form using the modified (for HSCT) NCI Common Toxicity 
Criteria ( Appendix P ). Attributes will include a description, date of onse t, maximum severity, and assessment 
of relationship to the study agent or other suspect agent(s).  
 
Adverse events will be graded accordingly: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life 
threatening or debilitating, and 5 = fatal.   All Grade 4 ( life-threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) events on the 
Adapted HSCT NCI scale meet expedited reporting requirements.

STUDY COORDINATOR’S MANUAL  
 
Association or relatedness to the study agent will be graded as follows: 1 = unrelated, 2 =  unlikely, 3 = 
possibly, 4 = probably, and 5 = definitely related.  
 
V. Case Report Forms  
Case report forms must be completed for all patients registered onto the protocols and submitted to the 
FHCRC data coordinating center. The first case report form (day 28) is due on day  50.  For outside centers 
a Staging Form must accompany the form with the patient staging at registration, day  28, day 56, day 84 
and day 100. Staging forms should also be completed with each Follow Up Form completed on day 180, 1 
year, 1.5 years, 2 years, 3 years, and yearly thereafter.  For Outside Centers,  case report forms are expected 
to be submitted no later than 30 days following the scheduled follow up date.  
 
VI. Protocol Monitoring  
As the coordinating center, FHCRC will monitor ac crual at the outside institutions. The guidelines below 
are intended to guide the reviewers in their assessment of items that significantly alter the clinical 
effectiveness of the treatment or the evaluation of its toxicity.

HLA MATCHING REQUIRE MENTS FOR UNRELATED DONORS  
AT THE SCCA / FRED H UTCHINSON ALLIED SYS TEM  
 
Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) Terminology. The HLA region consists of genes that encode two 
classes of HLA molecules. HLA class I molecules , HLA -A, -B, and –C, are composed of a single 
glycoprotein chain that is expressed in association with 
 2-microglobulin on most tissue cells. HLA class 
II molecules , HLA -DR, -DQ, and –DP, are heterodimers consisting of 
 and 
 glycoprotein chains. 
HLA class I and HLA class II molecules are highly polymorphic.  
 
 
HLA Typing Methods. At the Seattle Cancer Care  Alliance Clinical Immunogenetics Laboratory (CIL) 
DNA -based methods of HLA -A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1 typing are now performed routinely. High resolution 
typing is required to define individual alleles and the level of mismatching between donor and recipient. 
High resolution  data are reported with four or more digits (e.g., A*0201, A*0205, B*1504, or 
DRB1*0401 ). A current listing of  recognized HLA alleles and their sequences can be found at the 
Immunogenetics/HLA sequence database  website at www.anthonynolan.org. uk/HIG/data.html . 
 
 
Initial typing reports obtained through the international marrow donor registries may consist of 
intermediate resolution typing. Intermediate resolution defines alleles in groups of related families 
historically defined as  antigens by alloantisera. Intermediate resolution typing results are reported as two 
digits (e.g., A*02, B*15, or  DRB1*04). In cases where the HLA -A, B and C loci are typed at intermediate 
resolution and high resolution data  are not available, it should be understood t hat unidentified allele 
disparity might be present.  
 
 
Donor Selection. Final selection of an unrelated donor should be based upon results of high resolution 
typing of HLA -A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1 alleles. Cross match assay is not required when high resolution 
typing indicates matching for HLA -A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 AND the platelet reactive antibody (PRA) 
screen is not elevated (defined as ≤10%). A negative cross match test result is required for final donor 
selection in the following situations: 1) PRA screen is positive (>10%), or 2) high resolution typing 
indicates mismatching for one or more HLA -A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 alleles. A positive anti -donor 
cytotoxic crossmatch absolutely excludes the donor.  
 
 
Donor Selection Criteria. Protocols and treatment plans m ust specify donor inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, using terminology indicated below.  
 
Donor inclusion criteria must specify 1) the allowable genetic relationship between the patient and donor 
(related and/or unrelated), 2) the allowable limits of mismatc h, and if applicable 3) any modification of 
mismatch criteria according to type of disease or patient characteristics.

Acceptable levels of recipient -donor mismatch for research related treatment protocols or standard 
treatment plans include the following:  
Allele -match for HLA -A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1.  
Single allele disparity for HLA -A, B, C, or DRB1 or DQB1  
Two allele disparities for HLA -A, B, or C.  
Single all ele disparity for HLA -DRB1 and/or a single DQB1 antigen or allele disparity.  
Single antigen plus single allele disparity for HLA -A, B, or C.  
 
The following levels of patient -donor mismatch should be restricted to research protocols:  
Two antigen disparity, either HLA -A plus C or HLA -B plus C.  
Single antigen disparity for HLA -DRB1 with or without DQB1 allele or antigen disparity  
Combined disparity of class I and class II loci, i.e. disparity for HLA -A, or B, or C, and any 
additional disparity for DRB1 or DQB1  
 
 
Donor Exclusion Criteria to be considered for protocols or standard treatment plans include:  
Double locus disparity. Two disparities are not allowed when they both involve the same locus, 
i.e., the patient is A*0101, A*0201 and the donor is A*0102 and A *0205.  
Recipient and donor homozygous at mismatched locus. Patient and donor pairs homozygous at 
the mismatched locus are considered a two -locus mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101 and the 
donor is A*0201, and this type of mismatch is not allowed.  
Recipi ent homozygous at mismatched locus. If the recipient is homozygous at HLA -A, B, or C 
and the donor is mismatched at that locus, i.e., patient is A*0101 and donor is A*0101 and 
A*0201, the risk of rejection is increased. Such a donor should be avoided if th ere is already an 
appreciable risk of rejection, i.e., in patients with CML/MDS/Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) or 
those receiving reduced conditioning.  
 
 
Relevance of HLA matching for transplantation of unrelated hematopoietic cells:  
Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing of patients and prospective hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) 
donors is carried out to identify and match for HLA determinants associated with successful HSC 
transplant outcome. While several preliminary studies (1, 2, 3) suggested the importance of allele level 
matching in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), recent comprehensive studies confirmed that allele -
level typing and matching is necessary to optimize clinical outcome in hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(4, 5, 6, 7).  
 
 The pervasive ness of occult HLA mismatch was shown by Petersdorf, et al in an analysis of 300 CML/CP 
unrelated donor -recipient pairs matched for HLA -A and B by serologic typing, and matched for the DRB1 
alleles.  (4) The percent of patient -donor pairs found to be matche d at the allele level for all 5 loci (HLA -A, 
B, C, DRB1, DQB1) was only 47% (n=142). High resolution typing demonstrated previously undetected 
mismatches in 53% (158), indeed 26% (79) pairs were mismatched for multiple alleles. Mismatch of class I 
HLA was found at one locus in 55 pairs (18%) and at two or more loci in 35 pairs (12%). A single 
mismatch of class II HLA was  detected in 24 pairs (8%), whereas 7 pairs (2%) had multiple class II 
mismatches, and 37 pairs (12%) had multiple mismatches involving bot h class I and class II. These data 
show the

System  
 
 
importance of high resolution typing for defining the degree of mismatching between potential unrelated 
patient -donor pairs.  
 
 
The degree of HLA mismatch, as well as the locus of mismatch, influence the development of alloimmune 
reactions and have significant implications for the outcome of HSC transplants. Studies of patient -donor 
pairs have shown an increased risk for g raft failure with multiple mismatches that involve at least one class 
I allele. The incidence of graft failure was 29% in pairs where the mismatch involved more than one class I 
allele mismatch and 12% for mismatches involving both class I and class II all eles, compared with 2% or 
less for pairs with either no mismatch or mismatch confined to a single HLA -A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 
allele. The risk of developing grades III -IV acute GVHD also has been shown to be influenced by the 
number and class of mismatched alleles. In studies involving primarily Caucasian patient -donor pairs, the 
highest risk for severe acute GVHD was observed for multiple mismatches involving both class I and class 
II alleles (2.0 hazard ratio and p=0.02). Pairs with a single class I mismat ch did not have a significant 
increase in acute GVHD compared with matched recipients, but a single class II mismatch or multiple class 
I mismatches both appeared to confer a higher (though not significant) hazard of severe GVHD. As results 
of future studi es further define risks of mismatches, particularly in nonCaucasi an populations, we may be 
able to delineate more precisely “low risk” from “high risk” mismatches. Until then, the donor selection 
process should endeavor to identify the best matched donor within the time allowed by the clinical 
situation.

COORDINATING CENTER FUNCTIONS  
Outside Center – PI Communication in Hematologic Malignancies  
 
I. Study Management, data analysis, and Data and Safety Monitoring  
 a. Study Management:  
i. Each local PI is responsible for selection, training and oversight of local study 
coordinators  
ii. The Coordinating Center registers subjects on the study and assigns study IDs  
iii. One copy of the research data is retained by the site. Another data set (identified only 
by study IDs) is transmitted to the Coordinating Center to create the master data file. 
All data are kept in locked areas and password protected databases accessible only to 
study staff  
iv. The quality of data is monitored in an ongoing fashion with the study team and 
corrective action plans instituted as necessary  
b. Data Analysis:  
i. Study staff review data for completeness as it is submitted by the sites  
ii. The study statistician is responsible for data cleaning and the conduct of analyses as 
outlined in the protocol and grant  
c. Data Safety and Monitoring:  
i. The trial coordinators at collaborating ce nters or the local PIs will report SAEs (as 
defined by the protocol) to the Coordinating Center and an official report of an SAE is 
faxed to the Coordinating Center within ten days 
ii. The SAE report is reviewed by the Overall PI. If the SAE meets the FHCRC cr iteria 
for expedited  reporting then an official signed report is submitted to the IRB  
iii. An independent DSMB will meet at six -month intervals and all outcome data is 
reviewed including all adverse events and SAEs reported to the Coordinating Center 
along with  those officially reported to the IRB  
iv. A report from the DSMB is submitted to the IRB as well as the trial coordinators/local 
PIs participating in the protocol  
 
II.  Protocol and informed consent document management  
a. A master protocol is maintained by the Co ordinating Center and distributed to the sites for 
customization and local IRB review  
b. All protocol and consent modifications initiated by the Coordinating Center are sent to the 
Collaborating Sites following approval by the Coordinating Center IRB, for rev iew and 
approval by the local IRB  
c. Changes required by local IRBs are reviewed by the Coordinating Center and approved prior 
to implementation at local sites  
 
III. Assurance of local IRB OHRP -approved assurance  
a. Each site provides their OHRP assurance number  and evidence of IRB certification  
b. Study staff monitor maintenance of institutional assurance and IRB certification

Forms and  IRB approval documentation  
b. No site may enroll subjects until the Coordinating Center has received confirmation of local 
IRB approval  
c. Each site is responsible for preparation and submission of their continuing reviews. Any 
changes to the protocol or consen t form will be communicated to the Coordinating Center  
d. Sites are required to have active IRB approvals to participate in any study related activities  
 
V. Any substantive modification by the Collaborating Institution related to risks or alternative 
procedur es is appropriately justified  
a.   The Coordinating Center reviews any modifications to consent forms to ensure that site 
consents do not delete or change the basic or additional elements or alternatives required in 
the sample consent form  
 
VI. Informed co nsent is obtained from each subject in compliance with HHS regulations  
a. Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to study participation  
b. The Coordinating Center verifies eligibility and signed consent prior to assigning a study ID

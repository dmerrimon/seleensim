ACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
2.1
 Concept Summary  
Patients  with EGFR  mutation  positive NSCLC  represent  approximately  10-15% of advanced  
NSCLC  and show remarkable sensitivity  to EGFR  tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib  
and gefitinib.  However,  most  patients  experience disease progression after approximately  one 
year and will require  second- line therapy. There  is evidence indicating  that these patients  may 
be particularly  sensitive  to taxane- based  therapies.  This study  will evaluate  the clinical  efficacy  
of single agent  nab-paclitaxel  in a cohort of patients  with EGFR  mutation  positive NSCLC  who 
have experienced  disease  progression during front -line therapy with an EGFR  TKI.  
2.2 N
SCLC  with  EGFR  mutations  
NSCLC  with EGFR  mutations  is a well described  molecular  subgroup of lung cancer  which  is 
remarkably  sensitive  to EGFR  TKIs.  The initial experience with these drugs identified favorable  
outcomes in patients  with adenocarcinoma histology,  Asian  ethnicity,  female sex and never  
smokers. Later  investigations demonstrated  that these populations are enriched  for EGFR  
mutated  NSCLC,  and that the presence  of an activating  EGFR  mutation  was highly predictive of 
response to EGFR  TKIs  [Pao,  Rosell].  The most common mutations  are exon 19 deletion  and a 
leucine- to-arginine  substitution  at position 858 in exon 21 (L858R) and these  comprise  
approximately 90% of the mutations  [Rosell].  However,  despite  the sensitivity  of these tumors  
to EGFR  TKIs,  most  patients  experience disease progression after a median  of 10 to 14 months  
of therapy [Oxnard].  For these  patients, no standard  therapy  exists  and research  is ongoing to 
identify  effective therapeutic options for second  line therapy.

Chemotherapy has clearly  been  shown to be inferior to EGFR  TKIs  in EGFR  mutation  positive  
NSCLC  in first line metastatic  patients  in both response rate and progression free survival;  
however, it also has been observed that these tumors  do exhibit significant response to 
chemotherapy.  In the Iressa  Pan-Asia study  (IPASS),  a  phase III trial of  gefitinib  versus 
carboplatin/paclitaxel  in advanced  NSCLC  in a population composed  of never - or light former  
smokers, gefitinib  was superior to chemotherapy, but patients  treated  with chemotherapy  did 
exhibit a significant response rate (RR)  of 32% and when  stratified  by mutational status,  a RR of 
47% was observed among  EGFR  mutant tumors  [Mok].  Other  phase III trials  of EGFR  mutant  
NSCLC  have shown  RR ranging from  10.5% to 36% in the chemotherapy  arm [Maemondo, 
Rosell,  Zhou]. These studies  indicate  that while  EGFR  TKIs  are clearly  superior in the first line 
setting,  chemotherapy  will likely  be beneficial  in patients  who relapse  after TKI treatment.  
 
2.3.1 Taxane- based chemotherapy  in patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC  
 
While  EGFR  mutation  positive NSCLC  does exhibit response  to cytotoxic chemotherapy,  there  
is no specific regimen  that has been  shown to be superior in this patient  population. However,  
there is evidence indicating  that these patients  may be particularly  sensitive  to taxane- based  
therapies.  In a retrospective analysis  of patients  with advanced  NSCLC  who initially  
experienced  disease  control  with   EGFR  TKIs  and  subsequently   received   second   line  
chemotherapy  for disease  progression, taxane- based  chemotherapy  was associated  with higher  
response rate (48% vs. 21%),  progression free survival (7 vs. 1.8 months)  and overall  survival  
(12.6 months vs. 5.1 months)  compared  to non- taxane based  regimens  [Kuo].  
 
2.4
 ABRAXANE® in advanced NSCLC 
 
ABRAXANE®  is a solvent -free, albumin -bound  form  of paclitaxel  which  is currently  indicated  
for the treatment  of breast  cancer  after failure  of combination  chemotherapy for metastatic  
disease or relapse  within  6 months  of adjuvant chemotherapy. It also has shown clinical  efficacy  
as first-line therapy  for NSCLC,  both as mono - and combination therapy and its use in the 
treatment  of other  malignancies  is under investigation. 
 
2.4.1 Monotherapy  
 
The efficacy  of weekly  nab-paclitaxel  monotherapy was shown  in a phase II study  which  
assessed  first-line nab-paclitaxel  125mg/m2  weekly  given on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28- day cycle  
in 40 patients  with advanced  NSCLC.  After  a median  of 4 cycles,  the study resulted  in an 
overall  response rate of 30%,  time to progression of 5 months and overall  survival  of 11 months.  
This study excluded  patients  who had received  previous chemotherapy  for advanced  disease;  
however, it did allow  patients  who were  previously treated  with EGFR  TKIs  who comprised  
13% of the participants  [Rizvi].  
 
Another study investigated  the efficacy  of nab-paclitaxel  260mg/m2 given every  3 weeks  as 
first-line therapy to 43 patients  with advanced NSCLC.  After  a median  of 6 cycles, the response 
rate was 16%, the median  time to progression was 6 months and overall  survival was 11 months  
[Green].   The most frequently reported  Grade 3 and 4 adverse  events  in these trials  were

Printed  on 7/10/2019  neutropenia, peripheral  neuropathy and fatigue.  No  severe  hypersensitivity  reactions  were  
observed in these trials  without corticosteroid  premedication.  Above studies  demonstrate  that 
nab-paclitaxel  as monotherapy is a promising strategy  in advanced  NSCLC.  
2.4.2
 Combination therapy  
Weekly  nab-paclitaxel  has also been  investigated  in combination  with carboplatin  in both phase  
II and III settings.  In a phase II study, 56 patients  with advanced NSCLC  received  weekly  nab- 
paclitaxel  100mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28- day cycle in combination with carboplatin  area 
under the curve (AUC)  6 on day 1 of each cycle.  Among  the 50 evaluable patients,  an overall  
response rate of 50% and a median  time to progression of 28 weeks  was reported  [Allerton].  
In 
a subsequent phase III study, weekly  nab-paclitaxel  100mg/m2 in combination with 
carboplatin  AUC  6 was compared  with solvent- based  paclitaxel  200mg/m2 and carboplatin  
every  3 weeks  in 1,052 patients  with advanced NSCLC.  After  a median  of 6 cycles,  there was 
significantly  improved overall  response rate in nab-paclitaxel  arm with a response rate of 33% 
by independent review  compared to 25% in the solvent- based  paclitaxel  arm. Interestingly, the  
response rate was particularly  higher with nab-paclitaxel  in the squamous  cell histology (41% vs. 
24%).  In the final analysis  of the study, there was no difference  in median  progression free 
survival (6.3 months vs. 5.8 months)  or overall  survival (12.1 months vs. 11.2 months)  between  
the two arms  [Socinski]. Grade 3 and 4 anemia and thrombocytopenia  were more  frequent in the 
nab-paclitaxel  arm while  neutropenia and peripheral  neuropathy were more  frequent in the 
solvent based  paclitaxel  arm. The above study shows that nab-paclitaxel  is as effective,  if not 
superior, to solvent based  paclitaxel  and is a promising chemotherapeutic agent  that warrants  
further investigation in the patient  population with EGFR  mutation  positive  NSCLC.  
2.5 S
PARC, a potential predictive marker of  nab- paclitaxel therapy  
SPARC  (a secreted  protein, acidic  and rich in  cysteine,  also known as osteonectin) is an 
extracellular  matrix  glycoprotein which  has shown to be overexpressed  in many  different tumors 
including breast,  head  and neck,  and lung cancers,  and its overexpression has been associated  
with poor prognosis. This protein can be produced  by the tumor  or the neighboring stroma.  
SPARC  can bind albumin  with high affinity  and studies have shown that SPARC  may  play a role 
in concentrating  albumin in the areas  near a tumor  [Gradishar].  Given  these observations,  
several  studies  have investigated  the role of SPARC  as a predictive tumor  marker  of nab- 
paclitaxel  response with the hypothesis that tumor- secreted  SPARC  could facilitate  the  
accumulation  of albumin  in the tumor and therefore  increase the effectiveness  of nab-paclitaxel.  
For instance,  a retrospective analysis  of nab-paclitaxel  monotherapy in head and neck cancers  
showed that the response to nab-paclitaxel  was higher in patients  whose tumors  were SPARC - 
positive by immunohistochemistry  compared  to SPARC -negative tumors  with response rates of 
83% vs. 25%, respectively  [Desai  2009]. In another study of metastatic  pancreatic  
adenocarcinoma,  previously untreated  patients  were  treated  with nab-paclitaxel  followed  by 
gemcitabine and their tumors  were evaluated  for SPARC  status by immunohistochemistry.  In 
this 
study, the high- SPARC  group resulted  in higher overall  survival when  compared  to the low- 
SPARC  group with median  survival  of 17.8 vs. 8.1 months, respectively. Interestingly,  stromal  
SPARC  was significantly  correlated  with overall  survival but not tumoral SPARC  [Von  Hoff].

In lung cancer,  the role of SPARC  was assessed  in a preclinical  study  of human NSCLC  cell 
lines  and patient -derived NSCLC  tumor  xenografts. This study showed  that nab-paclitaxel  
resulted  in anti-tumor  efficacy,  however, this was not associated  with SPARC  expression by 
mRNA and gene methylation  [Shao].  Above studies  demonstrate  that SPARC  protein  
expression by immunohistochemistry  is a potential predictive biomarker of nab-paclitaxel  
therapy  and warrants  further investigation. 
 
 
3. DRUG  INFORMATION, ABRAXANE® (NAB- PACLITAXEL)  
 
3.1 Description  
 
ABRAXANE®  for Injectable  Suspension (also  known as ABI-007, nab-paclitaxel,  paclitaxel  
protein-bound particles  for injectable  suspension) is an albumin -bound  form  of paclitaxel  with a 
mean  particle  size of approximately  130 nanometers.  Paclitaxel  exists  in the particles  in a non- 
crystalline,  amorphous state.  ABRAXANE  is supplied as a white  to yellow,  sterile,  lyophilized  
powder for reconstitution  with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection,  USP prior to 
intravenous infusion. Each  single -use vial contains 100 mg of paclitaxel  and approximately 900 
mg of human albumin. Each  milliliter  (mL)  of reconstituted  suspension contains  5 mg paclitaxel.  
ABRAXANE  is free of solvents.  The active agent  in ABRAXANE  is paclitaxel.  
 
 
3.2
 Mechanism of action  
 
ABRAXANE  is a biologically  interactive  albumin -bound  paclitaxel  combining  a protein with a 
chemotherapeutic agent  in the particle  form.  This composition provides a novel approach  of 
increasing  intra-tumoral  concentrations of the drug by a receptor -mediated  transport  process 
allowing  transcytosis across  the endothelial cell. This albumin -specific  receptor  mediated  
process  involves the binding of albumin  to a specific receptor  (gp60) on the intralumminal  
endothelial cell membrane,  resulting  in activation  of a protein (caveolin -1), which  initiates  an 
internalization  process in the endothelial cell through the formation  of caveolae,  with transport  
of the intact  albumin -bound  chemotherapeutic  complex  via these caveolae to the underlying  
tumor  interstitium [Desai  2004]. A protein specifically  secreted  by the tumor  (SPARC)  binds  
albumin,  allowing  release of the hydrophobic drug to the tumor  cell membrane  [Desai  2004]. 
ABRAXANE  is the first biologically  interactive  nanoparticle product leveraging this gp- 
60/caveolin- 1/caveolae/SPARC  pathway  to increase intra-tumoral  concentration of the drug and 
reducing toxic effects  in normal tissue.  
 
3.3 Preclinical studies  with ABRAXANE  
 
Preclinical  studies  comparing  nab-paclitaxel  to Taxol® (paclitaxel  Cremophor® EL solvent -based,  
BMS)  demonstrated lower  toxicities,  with an MTD approximately 50% higher  for nab-paclitaxel  
compared  to Taxol®. At equal  doses there was less myelosuppression and improved efficacy  in a 
xenograft tumor model  of human mammary  adenocarcinoma. At equitoxic doses of paclitaxel,  
nab-paclitaxel  treated  groups showed more  complete  regressions, longer time to recurrence,  
longer doubling time,  and prolonged survival. At equal  dose, tumor  paclitaxel  area under the

Printed  on 7/10/2019  curve was 33% higher for nab-paclitaxel  versus solvent based  paclitaxel,  indicating  more  
effective intratumoral accumulation  of nab-paclitaxel  [Desai  2006].

At any given dose of paclitaxel  in mg/m2,  the total mg of paclitaxel  to be administered  should be  
calculated  by the physician, using the height/weight conversion chart  or other standard method  
for calculation  of the patient ’s body surface area (BSA).  
Reconstitution  
ABRAXANE  is supplied as a sterile,  lyophilized powder for reconstitution  before  use. To avoid  
errors,  read preparation instructions  prior to reconstitution.  
 
1. Aseptically,  reconstitute  each vial by injecting  20 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection.  
 
2. Slowly  inject  the 20 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection  over a minimum of 1 minute,  using  
the sterile  syringe to direct  the solution flow onto the INSIDE  WALL  OF THE  VIAL.  
 
3. DO NOT  INJECT  the 0.9%  sodium chloride injection  directly  onto the lyophilized  cake as 
this will result  in foaming.  
 
4. Once the injection  is complete,  allow  the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 minutes  to ensure  
proper wetting  of the lyophilized  cake/powder.  
 
5. Gently  swirl  and/or invert the vial slowly  for at least 2 minutes  until complete  dissolution of 
any cake/powder  occurs.  Avoid  generation  of foam.  
 
6. If foaming or clumping  occurs,  stand  solution  for at least 15 minutes  until foam  subsides.

Administration  
Parenteral  drug products should be inspected  visually  for particulate  matter  and discoloration  
before  administration  whenever  the solution and container permit.  The reconstituted  sample  
should be milky  and homogenous, without visible  particulates.  If particulates  are visible  or 
settling  occurs,  the vial should be gently inverted  to ensure complete  resuspension before  use. 
Discard  the reconstituted  suspension if precip itates  are observed. Discard  any unused portion. 
 
Each  vial of the reconstituted  formulation will contain  5 mg of paclitaxel  per mL. The exact  total 
dosing volume  of 5 mg/mL  suspension required  for the patient  is calculated  using this formula:  
 
Dosing volume (mL) = Total  dose (mg) / 5 (mg/mL)  
 
The appropriate amount of reconstituted ABRAXANE  is injected  into an empty,  sterile,  PVC - or 
non− PVC -type IV bag. The use of an in-line filter  is not recommended. 
 
Given  the possibility  of extravasation,  it is advisable to closely  monitor the infusion site for 
possible infiltration  during drug administration.  Limiting  the infusion of ABRAXANE  to 30 
minutes  (or as directed  according to the protocol) reduces  the likelihood of infusion- related  
reactions.  No premedication  to prevent solvent -related  HSRs  is required  with ABRAXANE.  
 
ABRAXANE  should be administered  under the supervision of a physician experienced  in the use 
of chemotherapeutic agents.  Appropriate management  of complications  is possible  only when  
adequate diagnostic and treatment  facilities  are readily  available.  
 
B
ecause  of the possibility  of myelosuppression  with ABRAXANE  and the exclusion of patients  
with a baseline neutrophil count < 1,500 cells/mm3  or a platelet  count < 100,000 cells/mm3  from  
the Phase III trial, ABRAXANE  should not be administered  to such patients.  Blood cell counts  
should be monitored weekly  during ABRAXANE  therapy. For patients  being  treated  on  
protocols using weekly  dosing schedules,  investigators should consult the requirements in the 
study- specific  protocol concerning dose modifications  and withholding treatment.  
 
In addition, patients  who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count <500 cells/mm3  for ≥  
1 week)  or severe peripheral  neuropathy during ABRAXANE  therapy  should have their dosage  
reduced  for subsequent courses of ABRAXANE.  For recurrence of severe episodes of either  AE, 
the dosage should be further reduced. For grade 3 peripheral  neuropathy, treatment should be  
withheld  until resolution  to grade 1 and then reduced  for all subsequent courses  of ABRAXANE  
therapy. In addition, investigators should consult the requirements  in the study -specific  protocol  
for dose reductions and withholding treatment.  
 
An albumin form  of paclitaxel  may substantially  affect  a drug ’s functional properties relative  to 
those of drug in solution.  Do not substitute  for or with other paclitaxel  formulations.

3.6 Storage and handling of study drug  
 
ABRAXANE  is a cytotoxic anticancer  drug and, as with other potentially  toxic  paclitaxel  
compounds,  caution  should  be exercised  in handling ABRAXANE.  The use of gloves is 
recommended.  
 
Procedures  for proper handling and disposal of anticancer  drugs should be followed. Several  
guidelines on this subject  are available [Clinical Oncological Society of Australia, Jones,  
American Medical Association, American Society of Hospital Pharmacists, Occupational Safety 
and Health  Administration, Jeffrey] . There  is no general  agreement  that all of the procedures  
recommended  in these guidelines are necessary  or appropriate. However,  according  to the Active  
Pharmaceutical  Ingredient  manufacturer ’s safety  data for paclitaxel,  the product should not be  
released  into the environment  despite the fact that it is a natural,  biodegradable product. It is 
recommended  that the material be recovered,  if possible, and incinerated  under controlled  
conditions in compliance with the local  and national regulations currently  in force.  
 
No reports  of accidental  exposure to ABRAXANE  have been  received;  however, tingling,  
burning, and redness  have been  reported  after topical  exposure to Cremophor -based  paclitaxel.  If 
ABRAXANE  (lyophilized cake or reconstituted  suspension) comes  in contact  with the skin, the  
skin should be washed  immediately  and thoroughly with soap and water.  Dyspnea,  chest  pain,  
burning eyes,  sore throat, and nausea have been  reported  after inhalation of solvent -based  
paclitaxel.  If ABRAXANE  comes  in contact  with mucous membranes,  the membranes  should be  
flushed thoroughly with water.  
 
U
nopened vials  of ABRAXANE  are stable  until the date indicated  on the package when  stored  in 
the original cartons  at USP Controlled Room Temperature (25ºC [77ºF], excursions  permitted  
between  15°- 30°C  [59°-86°F]),  or as specified  on the vial label  and as per the country  
requirements.  
 
Stability  of reconstituted  suspension in the vial 
From  a microbiological point of view,  the reconstituted  suspension in the vial should be filled  
into an infusion bag immediately.  If not filled  immediately,  storage times  and conditions are the  
responsibility  of the user and should not normally be longer than 8 hours at 2−8°C (36−46°F).  If 
not used immediately,  each vial of reconstituted  suspension should be replaced  in the original  
carton  to protect it from  bright light.  
 
Stability  of the reconstituted  suspension in the infusion bag 
From  a microbiological  point of view,  the reconstituted  suspension  in the infusion bag should be  
used immediately.  If not used immediately,  in-use storage times  and conditions prior to 
administration  are the responsibility  of the user and should not normally  be longer than 8 hours 
at ambient  temperature  (approximately 25°C [77°F]) and lighting  conditions.

5. STUDY TREATMENT  PLAN  
 
Patients  enrolled  on study  will be treated  with weekly  nab-paclitaxel  until disease progression or 
intolerance of treatment.  Nab-paclitaxel  will be administered  in the infusion center  of the 
treating  physician. 
 
5.1 Administration of schedule of nab -paclitaxel  
 
A treatment  cycle is defined  as one 28- day period and includes three weekly  doses of 
intravenous nab-paclitaxel,  administered  on days 1, 8 and 15. Each  nab-paclitaxel  dose will be  
calculated  based  upon patient’s  body surface area (BSA),  with maximum  body surface  area 
capped at 2.0m2. Each  nab-paclitaxel  dose is 125mg/m2, and will be infused over 30 minutes, or 
per standard  pharmacy  protocol. Total dose  of nab-paclitaxel  will be calculated  by BSA  
determination on the first day of each cycle,  using actual  weight. A delay  of cycle as a result  of 
holidays, weekends,  bad weather,  or other unavoidable  circumstances  will be permitted  and not 
counted as a protocol violation.

5.2 Nab-paclitaxel premedications  
 
Patients  do not require  premedication  prior to ABRAXANE  administration,  as hypersensitivity  
reactions  are rare. 
 
Although  the solubilizing  agents  Cremophor® EL and Tween® 80 have long been  implicated  in 
adverse  events  including hypersensitivity reactions  due to their detergent-like nature and known 
ability  to induce histamine  release [Ten  Tije],  the administration  of solvent -based   taxanes  
(Taxol and Taxotere) requires  premedication  with corticosteroids  and histamine  receptor  
blocking agents  to prevent the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions.  However,  the  
hypersensitizing role of the taxane molecules  themselves  cannot be ruled  out. 
 
In the unlikely event  of a mild hypersensitivity reaction,  premedication for subsequent doses  
may be administered  using the premedication  regimen  the institution  typically  uses for solvent  
based  paclitaxel.  
 
In the rare event  of a severe hypersensitivity reaction,  discontinue ABRAXANE.  
 
5.3 Dose modifications  
 
Administration  of Study Drug  to Patients  with Abnormal Hematologic  Function 
ABRAXANE  dosing should not be administered  at the start of each cycle until the absolute  
neutrophil count (ANC)  returns  to ≥1.0 x 109 cells/L  and the platelet  count returns  to >100 x 109 
cells/L.  For patients  receiving  weekly  ABRAXANE,  for each subsequent dose of ABRAXANE  
within  a cycle (Days 8  and 15), patients must  have an  ANC  ≥ 1.0 x 109 cells/L  and platelets  > 75 
x 109 cells/L.  
o If the ANC  and platelets  are not adequate for treatment  on Day 8 and/or 15, the dose 
will be omitted  and the total cycle length  remains  the same.  
o If the ANC  and platelets  are not adequate for treatment on Day 15 the dose will be  
omitted  and a new treatment  cycle will commence the following week,  as long as the 
ANC  count has returned  to ≥1.0 x 109 cells/L  and the platelet  count has returned  to 
>100 x 109 cells/L.  
Administration  of Study  Drug  to Patients  with Abnormal Hepatic Function 
Study drug should only be administered  if hepatic function is within  the parameters  established  
in the eligibility  criteria.  Hepatic toxicity  from  taxanes  may occur  but it is  uncommon.  
Therefore,  hepatic dysfunction that occurs  while  the patient  is on study  should prompt  an 
evaluation  to determine the cause,  including the possibility  of progressive metastatic disease and 
hepatotoxicity from  concurrent medications .

OR 
For patients  on weekly  
treatment  whose next  
treatment  within  the cycle  
(Day  8 or Day 15) is omitted  
due to persistent  neutropenia  
(ANC  < 1000 cells/mm3).

Neutropenia < 500 cells/mm3 
for > 1 week  Any 
Occurrence  At the first occurrence of a hematological  
toxicity  (as outlined  in the Adverse Event  
column), dose reduction to the next lower  level  
will be required  for subsequent cycles  once  
ANC  is ≥ 1000 cells/mm3. 
 
In the event  that a hematological toxicity  re- 
occurs,  dose reduction to the next lower  level  
will be required  for subsequent cycles  once  
ANC  is ≥ 1000 cells/mm3. 
Alternatively, the same  dose may be maintained  
and G-CSF is given as outlined below  in the 
event  of reoccurrence.  In the event  that a 
hematological toxicity  re-occurs  in the face of 
G-CSF,  dose reduction to the next lower  level  
will be required  for subsequent cycles  once  
ANC  is ≥ 1000 cells/mm3. 
 
If G- CSF is given concurrently  with weekly  
ABRAXANE,  administration  may begin the day 
after ABRAXANE  is given  and should stop at 
least 48 hours prior to when  ABRAXANE  is 
given  the following  week.

G-CSF Administration  
For weekly  study drug administration  administer  G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/day (rounded to the nearest  
vial size per investigator/institution’s  standard of care)  24 hours after chemotherapy  and hold 48 
hours prior to the next dose 
 
Peripheral  Neuropathy 
ABRAXANE  should be withheld in patients  who experience ≥ Grade 3 peripheral  neuropathy.  
Treatment  may be resumed  at the next lower  dose level  (see Table 2) in subsequent cycles  after 
the peripheral  neuropathy improves to ≤ Grade 1. The time to resolution to Grade ≤ 1 should be 
the adverse event  duration used for adverse event reporting. In those patients  who experience  
Grade 4 peripheral  neuropathy, study drug should be withheld, and treatment  resumed  at a 
reduction of 2 dose levels  (Dose  Level  -2; see Table  2) in subsequent cycles  after the peripheral  
neuropathy improves to ≤ Grade 1. 
 
Hypersensitivity  Reactions  
Hypersensitivity  reactions  rarely  occur. If they do occur, minor  symptoms such  as flushing, skin  
reactions,  dyspnea, lower  back  pain,  hypotension, or tachycardia may require  temporary  
interruption of the infusion. However,  severe reactions,  such as hypotension requiring treatment,  
dyspnea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema  or generalized  urticaria  require immediate  
discontinuation of study  drug administration  and aggressive symptomatic  therapy. Patients  who 
experience a severe hypersensitivity  reactions  to ABRAXANE  should not be re-challenged.  It is 
not recommended  to administer  ABRAXANE  to patients  with prior hypersensitivity to a taxane.  
Other  Toxicities  
A dose hold  and /  or dose  reduction is permissible  for any  grade 2  drug-related  adverse  events at  
the treating  investigator’s discretion,  until satisfactory  resolution  of the AE. If drug related  
toxicities  are ≥ grade 3, except  for anemia,  treatment  should be withheld  until resolution to ≤ 
grade 1 or baseline  if baseline was greater  than grade 1, then reinstituted,  if medically  
appropriate, at the next lower  dose level  (see Table  2). 
 
5.4 Concomitant  therapy  
 
Supportive care,  including but not limited  to anti-emetic medications,  may be administered  at the 
discretion  of the site investigator. Concurrent treatment  with bisphosphonates or other bone  
sparing agents  are allowed.  G-CSF may be administered  at the discretion  of the investigator,  
consistent with institutional guidelines. 
 
Patients  may have interruption in their treatment schedule for palliative  radiotherapy and/or  
brain  radiotherapy for progressive brain  metastasis  during the course of treatment.   Patients  may

resume  study treatment  after one week  of completion  of radiotherapy at the discretion  of the  
investigator if their systemic  disease remains  stable  or continues to respond to study treatment.  
 
No other concurrent  investigational  drugs or other anticancer  drugs will be allowed.  Also,  
concurrent treatment  with any of the following may not be administered:  Ritonavir, Saquinavir, 
Indinavir and Nelfinavir.  
 
 
5.5 Discontinuation of study treatment  
 
Patients  will be discontinued from  study treatment  under the following  circumstances:  
 
• The patient  may withdraw from  the study, at any time and for any reason,  without  
prejudice to future  care from  the investigator or the institution.  
• The investigator decides  the patient  should  be withdrawn  from  the study. If a serious  
adverse event,  or clinically  significant laboratory value,  form  the basis  for this decision,  
then the investigator will discontinue the study  treatment  and take appropriate measures.  
• Disease  progression, as defined  by RECIST  1.1 criteria  
o Patients  will be able to continue on study if they have progressive brain  metastasis  
as discussed  in section  5.4. 
• Death  
• The study treatment  is associated  with excess  toxicity,  such that a third  dose reduction  
would  be indicated.  (See Tables  2 and 3) 
• Th e  study treatment  is associated  with excess  toxicity, such that treatment  has been  
delayed  longer than 21 days. 
• Peripheral  neuropathy ≥ Grade 3 ≥ 21 days 
• Significant non-compliance  to protocol,  as judged by the investigator 
 
5.6 Treatment  compliance  
 
Records  of study medication  used,  dosage administered,  and intervals  between  visits  will be kept 
during the study. Drug  accountability  will be noted  at the completion  of the trial. 
 
 
6. CLINICAL  AND LABORATORY  ASSESSMENT  
 
Patient  must  be followed  at the study center  according  to the visit schedule,  with assessments  as 
outlined in the Study Calendar  (Appendix 2). Special  attention  should be given to the patients  
with bulky tumors  or tumors  involving or close to vital organs. These  patients  should be 
monitored very closely  during the first months of treatment,  as judged appropriate by the treating  
physician.

6.3 Assessments, post -treatment period  
 
Four week  visit: The patient  will undergo evaluation  for toxicity  four weeks  (+/- 7 days) after 
the last dose of nab-paclitaxel.  This evaluation  will occur, regardless  of reason  for stopping nab- 
paclitaxel  treatment (i.e. completion  of study treatment,  disease progression, withdrawal  from  
study). Patients  will undergo the following tests and procedures:  
• Notation of concurrent illnesses  and changes  in baseline medications  
• Assessment  of adverse events  and toxicity  rating  using NCI CTCAE  version 4.0 
• Physical  examination,  including weight, blood pressure  and pulse 
• ECOG performance  status  
• Complete  blood count, with absolute neutrophil count and platelet  count 
• Serum  chemistries  including BUN,  creatinine,  sodium, potassium,  bicarbonate,  chloride,  
calcium,  glucose, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline  phosphatase, AST  (SGOT)  and ALT  
(SGPT) . 
• If a treatment -related  adverse effect  has not stabilized  or resolved  to ≤ Grade 1 or 
baseline,  the patient  will be seen monthly until such resolution has been  documented  or 
another anti-neoplastic therapy  has begun. 
 
Monthly assessment,  post-treatment  period: Patients  who have stopped study treatment  without  
documentation of disease progression, will be seen monthly  by the study physician. Patients  will 
undergo the following evaluation monthly until disease progression is documented,  at which  
time they may be followed by telephone. 
• Radiographic efficacy  assessment  every  eight  weeks  
 
Telephone follow  up: If disease progression is documented, follow-up may thereafter  occur  by 
telephone. A study  investigator, nurse or coordinator will contact  each patient  every  three  
months (+/- 2 weeks),  until death  or the study  is stopped by the investigator. The following will 
be documented:

7. EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Please see Study Calendar  (Appendix 2) for timing  of radiographic efficacy  assessments.  
 
7.1 Screening evaluation  
 
Within  30 days prior to the first dose of nab-paclitaxel,  baseline tumor  measurement(s)  will be  
performed  for each patient.  Conventional computed  tomography (CT)  scan of the chest  and 
upper abdomen should be performed.  In addition to imaging  of the chest  and upper abdomen,  
other known sites of measurable disease  should be quantified by CT. 
 
7.2 Efficacy  evaluations, treatment period  
 
An objective assessment  of all measurable and unmeasurable disease will be performed  
according  to the Study Calendar  (See Appendix 2). Tumor response or progression will be 
defined  by RECIST  1.1 criteria,  as detailed  below.  Objective responses  will include both partial  
and complete  responses (PR and CR).  
 
All tumor  assessments should be performed  within  14 days of the scheduled  assessment  date.  
Radiological studies must  account  for all lesions  that were present  at baseline.  All known 
disease (measurable and non-measurable,  as defined  below, section  7.4) must be accounted  for 
when  assessing  objective tumor status.  
 
The fi rst  tumor assessment  will occur  after two 4-week  cycles  of study treatment,  and every  two 
cycles  thereafter.  After  first documentation of disease progression, no further radiographic  
assessment  is required. 
 
At any time,  radiological evaluation  may be ordered  based  on clinical  symptoms  or signs, 
prompting  concern  for disease  progression. 
 
7.3 Efficacy  evaluations, post -treatment period  
 
Patients  who stop study treatment  due to toxicity  or other circumstances  specified  in Section  5.6 
but continue to exhibit response or stable  disease at the end of study treatment  will be scheduled  
for further radiographic efficacy  assessments.   Tumor assessment  by CT  will be conducted every  
2 months  (+/- 2 weeks)  until documentation of disease progression. 
 
7.4 Definitions  
 
Measurable disease : the presence of at least one lesion  that can be accurately  measured  in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter  to be recorded)  as ≥10 mm with spiral  CT scan for non- 
lymph  nodes or ≥ 1.5 cm in short- axis diameter  for lymph  nodes

Version:  12/11/2015  25 
Printed  on 7/10/2019   
  
 
Non-measurable disease :  all other lesions,  including small lesions (longest  diameter  <10 mm 
with spiral  CT scan or pathological lymph  nodes with >10 to <15mm short axis).  
 
7.5 Baseline documentation of tumor  burden  
 
Target lesions:  All measurable  lesions  up to a maximum of two lesions  per organ and five 
lesions in total,  representative  of all involved organs, should be identified  as target  lesions.  
These should be recorded  and measured  at baseline.  Target  lesions should be selected  on the  
basis  of their size (those  with the longest diameter)  and their suitability  for accurate  repeated  
measurements  (either  by imaging techniques or clinically).  A sum of the longest diameter  for all 
target  lesions will be calculated  and reported  as the baseline sum longest diameter  (SLD).  The 
baseline SLD  will be used as the reference by which  to characterize the objective tumor response. 
Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease)  should be identified  as non- target  
lesions, and should also be recorded  at baseline.  Measurements  of these lesions are not required,  
but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
7.6 Response criteria  
 
Radiological response will be defined according  to the modified  RECIST  criteria,  as follows: 
 
Evaluation of target lesions:  
• Complete response (CR): disappearance of all target  lesions 
• Partial response  (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the  sum of the longest diameter  of the  
target  lesions, taking as reference the baseline SLD  
• P rogressive disease  (PD): at least a 20% increase  in the SLD  of target  lesions, taking as  
reference  the smallest  SLD  recorded  since  the treatment started,  or the appearance of  one 
or more  new lesions 
• Stable  disease  (SD): neither  sufficient  shrinkage to  qualify  for  PR,  nor  sufficient  
increase to qualify for progressive  disease, taking as reference the smallest  SLD  since  the 
treatment  started.  
 
Evaluation of non-target lesions:  
• Complete Response  (CR): disappearance of all non- target  lesions  
• Incomplete Response/Stable  Disease  (SD): persistence  of one or more  non-target  
lesion(s)  
• Progressive Disease:  appearance of one or more  new lesions and/or unequivocal  
progression of existing  non- target  lesions 
 
 
8. SAFETY ASSESSMENT AND ADVERSE  REPORTING  
 
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety  of patients  who have entered  this study,  
and for alerting  both the Fred Hutchinson/University of Washington  Cancer  Consortium IRB and 
Celgene Drug  Safety  to any event  that seems  unusual.

Safety  assessments will occur  on the day of each nab-paclitaxel  infusion. Safety  measurements  
include history, evaluation  for side effects  and other adverse events,  physical examination,  
review  of concomitant medications  and laboratory  tests.  Toxicities  will be graded according  to 
NCI CTCAE  version 4.0. Adverse events  will be recorded  after the first dose of study therapy  
has been  given. Only  the following adverse events will be recorded  in the case report  forms  
(CRF):  
• All grade 3 and higher adverse  events  
• Any other adverse event  that requires  a dose reduction or a dose delay  
 
8.1 Adverse events  
 
An adverse event  (AE)  is any undesirable medical  condition (sign,  symptom  or diagnosis) or 
worsening of a preexisting medical  condition, which  occurs after initiating  study treatment,  
whether  or not considered causally  related  to the investigational product. Abnormal laboratory  
values  or test results constitute  AEs only if deemed  clinically  significant by the investigator, e.g. 
they induce clinical  signs or symptoms,  or require therapy. 
 
AEs are collected  from  first dose  of study  drug until 30 days after the last  dose of study  drug. An 
event  that, in the judgment of the investigator, is unequivocally due to progression of disease  
should not be reported  as an adverse  event.  
 
Th
e following attributes  must  be recorded  by the study  personnel for each adverse event:  
• Description  
• Severity  
• Causality  
• Action  taken  
 
8.2 Serious adverse events  
 
A serious adverse event  is defined  by regulatory agencies  as one that suggests a significant  
hazard  or side effect,  regardless  of the investigator’s  opinion regarding  relationship  to the 
investigational treatment.  This includes any undesirable sign, symptom  or medical  condition  
which: 
 
• Is fatal or immediately  life-threatening 
• Requires  or prolongs inpatient hospitalization  
• Results  in severe or permanent  disability  or incapacity  
• Constitutes  a congenital anomaly or a birth  defect  
• Is medically  significant,  may jeopardize the subject and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes  listed  above 
 
Events not considered  to be serious  adverse  events  are hospitalizations  for the: 
 
• Routine  treatment   or  monitoring  of  the  studied   indication,  not  associated   with  any 
deterioration in condition

• Treatment,  which  was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing  condition that did not  
worsen  
• Treatment  on an emergency,  outpatient basis  for an event  not fulfilling  any of the  
definitions  given  above and not resulting  in hospital  admission 
 
An event  that, as judged by the investigator, is unequivocally due to progression of disease  
should not be reported  as a serious  adverse event.  
 
8.3 Reporting a serious adverse event  
To ensure patient  safety,  every  SAE,  regardless  of suspected  causality,  occurring after the patient  
has initiated  study  therapy  and until 30 days after the last dose of drug must be reported. Any 
SAEs  experienced after  this 30- day period should only be reported to Celgene Drug  Safety  if the 
investigator suspects  a causal  relationship  to the study drug. SAEs  that occur  at a Network  site 
will be reported  to the Network  office  within  24 hours of learning  of its occurrence.  The 
Network  Office  will then forward  the SAE  reports  to both the Coordinating Center  Principal  
Investigator (or designee)  and Celgene  Drug  Safety  within  24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  
SAEs  will be reported  to the Fred Hutchinson/University of Washington  Cancer  Consortium IRB 
in accordance with applicable AE reporting  policies.

9.1 Study initiations  
 
Before  the start of this study and the shipment  of investigational agent  to the main  site and any 
sub-site, the following documents  must be on file at the coordinating center  (University of 
Washington). 
1. U.S.  Food   and  Drug   Administration   (FDA)   Form  1572,  signed  by  the  Principal  
Investigator 
• The names  of any sub-investigators must appear  on this form.  
2. Current  curricula vitae  and license of the Principal  Investigator 
3. A financial  disclosure statement  from  the Principal  Investigator 
4. Delegation  of Authority 
5. Written  documentation  of IRB approval of protocol and ICF (identified  by title and 
date of approval) for each site 
 
 
10. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Study endpoints  
10.1.1 Primary endpoint:  Overall  response rate 
The primary  endpoint will be overall  response rate. Responses include both complete  and partial  
responses, as defined by RECIST  1.1 criteria.  
 
10.1.2 Secondary  endpoints:  Time  to progression,  overall survival, toxicity  
 
Time  to tumor  progression is defined  as time elapsed  from  date of informed consent, until the 
first documentation of progressive disease.  Overall survival is defined  as time elapsed  from  date 
of informed  consent, until death.  Both  time to progression and overall  survival will be reported  
as median  values.  Toxicity  rates will be described  as percentage of patients  experiencing  Grade  
3 or higher toxicity.  Toxicity  rates  will be presented  in two ways:  1) overall percentage of 
patients  experiencing  Grade  3 or higher toxicity;  2) overall  percentage of patients  experiencing  
toxicity  within  a clinically  significant  category  – including neutropenia, neutropenic fever  and 
neuropathy. 
 
10.2 Study design  
This study is a single -arm, phase 2 study  of weekly  nab-paclitaxel  in patients  with advanced  
EGFR  mutation  positive NSCLC  after front  line therapy  with an EGFR  TKI.  
10.3 Sample size determination and data analysis  
This is a single -arm, phase  2 study and a total of 29 patients  will be enrolled  in this trial. We 
will utilize  Fleming’s  single  stage design where there is a level  of response, P 0, below which  the 
treatment  would not be considered for further  study, and a higher level,  P1, above which  the 
treatment  warrant  further investigation  [Girling].  Phase  II published response rates to single -

agent  nab-paclitaxel  range from  16-30%, with weekly  therapy  resulting  in a 30% response rate 
[Rizvi].  Therefore,  a response rate <10%  (P0) will be considered  null and we would not be 
interested  in pursuing this therapy  further.  If the response rate were 30% (P1) or better,  this 
therapy  would be considered  worth  further study. With  this design, we have 90% power to 
detect  a true response rate of 30%. If the true response rate is  10%, then we have a 5% chance of 
falsely  rejecting  the null rate of 10% (α = 0.05, β = 0.10, P 0 = 10%, P 1 = 30%).  We will 
calculate the response rate as the proportion and 95% confidence interval  of patients  who 
achieved  a complete  response or partial response. We will also report time to progression and 
overall  survival as median  values  with their respective  95% confidence intervals.  We will 
estimate  time to event  distributions using  the Kaplan -Meier  method. 
 
10.4 Exploratory analysis  
 
An exploratory analysis  will examine the response  rates  stratified  by the following histologic  
subtypes  if available:  adenocarcinoma,  squamous cell carcinoma,  large cell carcinoma,  NSCLC  
others. However,  it is expected  that the adenocarcinoma subtype will comprise  the majority  of 
lung cancers  in this study. Given  the lack of sufficient statistical  power to assess response rates  
by the stratified  subtypes, no formal  statistical analysis  will be performed.  Also,  a correlative  
tissue  analysis  of SPARC  expression will be assessed  on available  tissue  specimens  if reliable  
detection  methodology is available  at the end of study recruitment  (Appendix  3).

study recruitment.  We will conduct an exploratory analysis,  correlating SPARC  expression with 
response rate and survival in patients treated  with nab- paclitaxel.  Analysis  of all tissue  samples  
for SPARC  will be blinded  with respect  to the treatment  assignment  and to the patient  response 
to treatment.  The number  and percentage of responding patients  (i.e., patients  that achieve an 
objective confirmed  complete  or partial overall  response) and non-responding patients  will be 
tested  for association  with SPARC  expression  (i.e., SPARC  positive vs. SPARC  negative) for 
each treatment  group.

Page 4 of 30 1 Background  
1.1 Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (allo HCT) for Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)  
 
Although acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children has become curable in 80% of cases,1 
the treatment outcome of adult ALL have been poor with cure rate of 30 -40%.2 This discrepancy 
may be explained, at least partially, by the difference in cytoge netic abnormality profile between 
children and adult ALL.3 In Adult ALL, the complete remission rate is 70 -90% with upfront 
therapy, but relapse rate thereafter is high. Thus long term survival can only be achieved in 30 -
40% of patients, and around 10% in patients abov e the age 60.3, 4 In order to improve outcome of 
adult ALL, allo HCT has been used as a consolidation for patients in the 1st complete remission 
(CR).5-7 Advanced age and limited performance status are associated with increased non -relapse 
mortality (NRM). Data from the European Group for Blood and Marrow transplantation (EBMT) 
showed NRM rate of about 30 % in adult ALL after allo HCT.8 
Results of the international trial of adult ALL (MRC UKALL XII/ECOG E2993)  showed superior 
outcome for allo HCT in adult patients with standard -risk ALL in CR1 when compared with 
autologous HCT. The stud y enrolled ALL patients between 15 and 49 year old (the upper limit has 
been changed to 54 years) and proceed to allogeneic HCT if HLA matched sibling donor is 
available. Conditioning regimen was total body irradiation (TBI) 1320 cGy ＋Etoposide 60 mg/kg. 
Patients in remission with no matched sibling were randomized to either chemotherapy 
maintenance or autologous HCT. They reported that relapse rate was significantly lower in cases 
with a donor compared to the ones without a donor in the analysis on Philadel phia chromosome 
negative (Ph -) cases, thus supported the presence of graft -versus leukemia (GVL) effect. In the 
standard risk cohort, patients with a donor showed better survival (62% vs. 52%, P = 0.02). In the 
high-risk cohort (age older than 35, or high WBC count at the time of diagnosis – more than 
100,000/µl in B -lineage, more than 30,000/µl in T -lineage), however, survival was not 
significantly different as NRM was high in the transplanted patients (41% vs. 35%, P = 0.2).9 In 
this study, the NRM rate was 20% and 39% in the young (< 35 years) and older patients underwent 
HCT, respectively.9 It was suggested from this result that advantage of transplant may be more 
apparent if NRM can be decreased in older age group by using less toxic conditioning regimens.

Page 5 of 30 1.2 Conditioning regimens for allo HCT in ALL  
The conditioning regimen being used most often for ALL has been the combination of 
cyclophosphamide (Cy) and total body irradiation (TBI) called CyTBI. The BuCy regimen, which 
replaced TBI of CyTBI with busulfan (Bu) has been shown to have comparable outco me to CyTBI 
in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)10, but inferior outcome in pediatric ALL.11 The 
combination of TBI and etoposide (Etp) has been associated with less relapse rate than CyTBI i n 
second CR.12 In addition, a randomized trial for pediatric ALL showed that TBICyEtp was superior 
to BuCyEtp in unrelated donor transplant with 3 -year event -free survival (EFS) of 57% and 20% 
for both groups respectively (P=0.04). This randomized prospective study suggests that TBI has 
more favorable outcome compared to Bu in pediatric patients with ALL undergoing allo HCT. The 
City of Hope (COH) group h as also reported EtpTBI regimen (TBI dose of 1320 cGy) in adult 
ALL.13 These reports provide evidences for efficacy of TBI -based containing regimens in adult 
ALL.  
 
1.3 Reduced -intensity allo HCT in ALL  
In reduced -intensity transplant (RIT), less intense conditioning is used with less regimen -related 
toxicity, but anti -tumor effect is more dependent on GVL effect, as the anti -tumor activity of 
conditioning regimen itself is reduced.  GVL may be less effective in ALL compared to myeloid 
tumors,  such as AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).14, 15 For this reason, recurrence of 
disease may be more of a concern.  There is paucity of data of RIT in ALL. Arnold et al reported 
22 cases of RIT for ALL using FluBu2 (fludarabine/busulfan) with or without ATG (anti -
thymoglobulin).  Among the cases who received RIT as the first transplant (11 cases) or second 
transplant (11 cases), 3 and 1 cases survived for a long time, respectively. All these 4 cases were  
transplanted at remission.16 Martino et al reported 27 cases who received RIT for ALL.17 A total 
of 23 out of 27 cases received a conditioning regimens based on Flu (90 -150 mg/m2) -Melphalan 
(Mel) (140mg/m2).  Two -year overall survival (OS) was 31%, and cumulative incidence of 
progression was 70% in cases without GVHD, 35% in cas es with GVHD, thus suggesting the 
presence of GVL effect in ALL. Only 5 cases relapsed out of 15 cases who received RIT at CR.17 
A multi -center retrospective analysis of 33 cases of RIT for ALL in Japan was published  by 
Hamaki et al.18 Conditioning regimens were either FluBu2 or FluMel in most of the cases. The 
disease status at transplant was CR1 (13), CR2 (6) or non -remission (14), and 14 cases of Ph+

                                                                                                                                                             Version 4.0, dated September 12, 2018  
 
Page 6 of 30 ALL were included. The 2 -year progression -free survival (PFS) and OS were 19% and 30 %, 
respectively. PFS at 1 -year was 31% in cases in CR1/CR2 at the time of transplant, and 29% in 
cases not in CR18. Another study reported data of 43 patients of ALL in CR2 who underwent RIT 
after conditioning regime n of Flu (90 mg/m2) Cy (1050 mg/m2) Bu (8 mg/kg).19 Regimen -related 
toxicity was acceptable, but relapse rate was as high as 70%, and OS at 3 years p ost-transplant was 
30%.  Mohty et al published a retrospective analysis of 97 patients who underwent RIT for ALL 
from EBMT20.  It is difficult to assess the conditioning regimens in this study as they used various 
regimens, but OS and relapse rate (RR) at 2 years were 52% and 40% in cases transplanted at CR1, 
27% and 63% in cases who had the transplant beyond CR1, 20% and 49% in cases transplanted at 
non-remission. For non -remission cases, the NRM was as high as 44%. The COH grou p reported 
their preliminary data of promising results of FluMel conditioning (Flu 125mg/m2 and Mel 
140mg/m2).21 FluMel regimen has also been used to salvage patients who relapsed after initial allo 
HCT.22 Higher dose of Flu of 160 mg in combination with Mel and thiotepa was shown to be 
feasible conditioning regimen for al lo HCT.23 Another study reported the outcome of 51 patients 
with ALL who were > 50 years old or younger with high risk disease. In this study, patients 
underwent allo HCT using conditioning regimen of  Flu TBI 2 Gy.24 The study showed 3-year 
overall survival of 34%. The 3 -year relapse rate was 40% and the NRM was 28%. Thus the use of 
reduced intensity regimen for ALL has become out of favor for high relapse rate that forfeits the 
benefit of reduced NRM.  
1.4 Conditioning regimen with FluTBI  
Most commonly used myeloablative conditioning regimen for relatively young patients with 
hematologic malignancies are CyTBI or BuCy. High -dose Cy may result in or contribute to severe 
regimen -related toxicities such as cardiac toxicity, hemorrhagic cystiti s, and sinusoidal obstruction 
syndrome (SOS) previously known as veno -occlusive disease (VOD) of liver. Fludarabine is less 
toxic and more immunosuppressive (thus facilitating engraftment) compared to high -dose Cy.25 
Based on these findings FluBu4 regimen has been developed by replacing Cy of BuCy with Flu. 
Busulfan dose in this regimen is myeloablative (4 -day dosing), as opposed to 2 -day regimen of Bu 
in RIT regimen, FluBu2.26 This regimen was reported to be safe and well tolerated than full 
intensity myeloablative regimens. The use of myeloablative regimen of FluTBI (8 Gy) was shown 
to result in successful engraftment in patients with AML with acceptable NRM rate.27  However, 

UAB BMTCT Program                                                                                                                                              UAB 1285 - FluTBI                                                                                                                                    
      
                                                                                                                                                             Version 4.0, dated September 12, 2018  
 
Page 7 of 30 the addition of melphalan to FluTBI regimen resulted in significantly high NRM of 40% in a 
retrospective data from Japan.28  
Since the use of TBI -based conditioning was shown to be more appropriate for ALL, a combination  
of Flu TBI may be more effective and better tolerated than Flu Mel or Flu Bu regimens for ALL. 
We will investigate the safety and efficacy of a myeloablative regimen of Flu TBI 12 Gy regimen 
for ALL patients who are not eligible for Cy TBI conditioning re gimen.

5.1.5.  Administration  
IV fludarabine is prepared by adding sterile water to the white solid cake. Reconstituted in 2mL 
of sterile water, the solid cake produces a sol ution with approximate concentration of 25mg/mL 
fludarabine phosphate. Follow the institutional guidelines for further preparation and 
administration procedures of fludarabine.  
 
Reconstituted IV fludarabine contains no antimicrobial preservative hence sho uld be utilized 
within 8 hours of reconstitution. It should NOT be infused concomitantly with another intravenous 
solution of unknown compatibility.  
5.2 Total Body Irradiation (TBI)  
TBI will be administered per standard of care procedure as implemented by radiation oncologists. 
TBI alone for post -pubescent patients with dose/fractionation not exceeding 2  Gy x  6 is well within 
the tolerance of most normal organs for <  5% risk of severe late toxicity (organ failure or major 
dysfunction) by 5 years. Notable exceptions are risk of cataract development, bone marrow 
suppression, ovarian and testicular dysfunction. Also, there is a small risk of second malignancy.  
The most common acute effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and painful swelling of the 
parotid glands.  
When TBI is given in conjunction with other therapies in the transplant setting, there is  additional 
risk of side effects including loss of appetite,   dry mouth, difficult or painful swallowing , headache , 
stomatitis (sore throat/mouth),  altered  skin integrity, hair loss,  swelling, increased risk for 
infection and/or bleeding, possible lung failure, dry cough, fatigue, anxiety, fever, possible liver 
failure, lung scarring, loss of vision, shortness of breath,  sterility, heartburn, cystitis, sle ep 
disturbances altered gastrointestinal and genitourinary function,  neuropathy,  fistulas, altered 
endocrine function, pericarditis  and increased risk of a second cancer. Overall, the incidence of 
most major toxicity when radiation is given in conjunctio n with other therapy as outlined above is 
still low,  rare, serious side effects are possible.

Page 15 of 30 5.3 Tacrolimus  
5.3.1. Chemical Characteristics  
Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant produced by Stretocyces Tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus 
has an empirical formulation of C44H69NO12 -H2O and a formula weight of 822.05. Tacrolimus 
appears as white crystals or crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in water, freely soluble 
in ethanol, and very soluble in methanol and chloroform. Tacrolimus inhibits T -lymphocyte 
activation, although the exact mechanism of action is not known. Experimental evidence suggests 
that tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP -12. A complex of tacrolimus -FKBP -12, 
calcium, calmodulin, and calcineurin is then formed and th e phosphatase activity of calcineurin 
inhibited.  This effect may prevent the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of 
activated T -cells (NF -AT), a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the 
formation of lymphokines (s uch as interleukin -2, gamma interferon). The net result is the 
inhibition of T -lymphocyte activation (i.e., immunosuppression).  
 
5.3.2. Available Forms  
 Tacrolimus is available for oral administration as capsules (tacrolimus capsules) containing the 
equiva lent of 0.5 mg, 1mg  and  5mg of anhydrous tacrolimus. Inactive ingredients include lactose, 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate. The 0.5 mg and 
1 mg capsule shell contains gelatin and titanium dioxide, and the 5 -mg capsule shell contains 
gelatine, titanium dioxide, and ferric oxide. Tacrolimus is also available as a sterile solution

5.4 Methotrexate  
5.4.1. Chemical Characteristics  
Methotrexate is a folate antimetabolite that inhibits DNA synthesis. Methotrexate irreversibly 
binds to dihydrofolate reductase, inhibiting the formation of reduced folates, and thymidylate 
synthetase, resulting in inhibition of purine and thymidylic acid synthesis. Methotrexate is cell 
cycle specific for the S phase of the cycle. It is also used as the immunosuppressive agent, or to 
prevent/treat GVHD.  The effect of this agent can be antagonize d with the administration of 
leucovorin.

5.4.4. Toxicity  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions associated with methotrexate use as GVHD 
prophylaxis include ulcerative stomatitis, leucopenia and suppressed hematopoiesis, nausea, and 
abdominal distress. Other frequently reported adverse effects are malais e, undue fatigue, chills, 
and fever, dizziness and decreased resistance to infection. Methotrexate may be associated with 
increased rates of pulmonary complications after transplantation. The risk of infections is due to 
the suppression of hematopoiesis af ter transplantation.

Page 18 of 30 5.5.2 Available Forms  
Thymoglobulin (Anti -thymocyte Globulin [Rabbit]) is available as sterile, lyophilized powder to be 
reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injections, EP.  
Each package contains one 10 mL vial. The reconstituted preparation contains approximately 5 mg/mL 
of Thymoglobulin of which >95% is rabbit gamma immune globulin (IgG). The reconstituted solution 
has a pH of 7.0 ± 0.4. Human red blood cells are used in the manufacturing process to deplete cross -
reactive antibodies to non T -cell antigens. The manufacturing process is validated to remove or 
inactivate potential exogenous viruses. All human red blood cells are from US registered or FDA 
licensed blood banks. A viral inactivation step (pasteurization, i.e., heat treatment of active ingredient 
at 60 oC/10 hours) i s performed for each lot.  
5.5.3 Storage and Handling  
Store in refrigerator between +2°C and +8°C (36°F to 46°F). A higher temperature of ≤37°C during 
transport for a total excursion time of ≤10 days will do the product no harm.  Protect from light.  Do 
not freez e.  Do not use after the expiration dated indicated on the label.  Any unused drug remaining 
after infusion must be discarded.  
5.5.4 Toxicity  
Thymoglobulin adverse events are generally manageable or reversible. The most frequent 
reported adverse events (more th an 25% of patients) include: fever, chills, leukopenia, pain, 
headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, thrombocytopenia, peripheral edema, 
dyspnea, asthenia, hyperkalemia, tachycardia, and infection.  
Serious immune -mediated reactions have been reported with the use of Thymoglobulin and 
consist of anaphylaxis or severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Fatal anaphylaxis has been 
reported. Severe, acute infusion -associated reactions (IARs) are consistent with CRS and can 
cause serious cardiore spiratory events and/or death. IARs may occur as soon as the first or 
second infusion during a single course of Thymoglobulin treatment. During post -marketing 
surveillance, fever, rash, arthralgia and/or myalgia have been reported to occur 5 to 15 days aft er 
onset of Thymoglobulin therapy, indicating possible serum sickness. These symptoms are 
manageable with corticosteroid treatment. Infections, reactivation of infection, sepsis, 
malignancies including post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) an d other 
lymphomas as well as solid tumors have been reported after Thymoglobulin administration in 
combination with multiple immunosuppressive agents.

Page 20 of 30 7 Statistical Considerations  
7.1 Sample Size  
This is a single center, single arm phase II study whose primary aim is to show an improvement in 
one-year DFS to 75% from an historical rate of ~ 45%. The estimated 1 -year OS of ALL patients 
≥ 20 years old undergoing allo HCT in first or subsequent CR is 55 -65% according to the data of 
the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR).31 CIBMTR did 
not report DFS in this subset of adult patients. Patients with ALL who are ≥ 35 years old are known 
to have high -risk disease and lower survival.3 A French study excluded patients who are ≥ 50 years 
from allo HCT and these patients (≥ 50 years) were randomized to either consolidation autologous 
HCT (auto HCT) or chemotherapy alone. The median DFS in this subset (≥ 50 years old) was 14 
months and 3 -year DFS was 24%.32, 33 According to these data, we estimate that th e 1-year DFS 
in patients ≥ 40 years old who receive allo HCT to be ~ 45%. We hypothesize that reduced toxicity 
myeloablative conditioning using FluTBI will improve this 1 -year DFS to 75%.  A maximum total 
of 16 evaluable patients will be enrolled to have a probability of .05 or less of concluding that the 
one year DFS rate exceeds 45% if it really is 45% and a probability of at least .80 of concluding 
that the one year DFS rate exceeds 45% if it is really .75%. We plan to enroll a total of 20 patients 
to all ow for non -evaluable patients (patients who sign consent and do not get transplant ). 
  
We estimate enrolling 7 -8 patients per year in the UAB transplant program.   
7.2 Analysis Methods  
Since all subjects will be followed for at least one year or until death, whichever is sooner, one 
year DFS can be thought of as a dichotomous (yes/no) variable.  Thus a two stage design based on 
a binomially distributed random variable is appropriate.  We have chosen a two stage design which 
will accrue 6 subjects in the first stage.  If one or fewer achieve one year DFS the study will be 
terminated with the conclusion that the one year DFS rate does not exceed 45%.  Otherwise, an 
additional 10 will be accrued for a total of 16.  If 10 or fewer of these 16 achieve one year DFS w e 
will conclude that the one year DFS rate does not exceed 75%.  Otherwise we will conclude that 
it does exceed 45%.  If the one year DFS rate is really 45%, the probability of concluding that it 
exceeds 45% (alpha) is 4.9%.  If the one year DFS rate is re ally 75% the probability of concluding 
that it does not exceed 45% (beta) is 19%. Note that this is not a MiniMax or Optimum design as 

UAB BMTCT Program                                                                                                                                              UAB 1285 - FluTBI

Page 21 of 30 described by Simon.  Those designs would have provided for an unacceptably high probability of 
early stopping for futilit y with a reasonably good one year DFS rate such as 60%.   One year DFS 
will be estimated using the method of Koyama and Chen (ref) which provides proper estimates 
and confidence intervals following two stage designs.  Disease -free survival and overall surv ival  
over time  will be estimated with Kaplan -Meier methods34 with standard  errors computed based on 
Greenwood’s formula.  Rates of relapse and acute and chronic graft -versus -host disease (all 
secondary objectives) will be estimated using the cumulative incidence methods described in Ruan 
and Gray.35 Engraftment (secondary objective) will be summarized with t he sample proportion of 
patients who engraft along with a corresponding exact 95% confidence interval, while regimen 
related toxicities (secondary objective) will be tabulated by category.  
8 Adverse Event Reporting   
Adverse events occurring following study registration, but prior to beginning transplant therapy 
will not be reported. Protocol related therapy does not begin until patients are admitted for their 
bone marrow transplant.    Regimen related toxicity and adverse events will be monitored for and 
reported  if required  through day 100. Adverse Event and Toxicity assessments will be performed 
at each study visit per the study calendar.  Following day 100, patients will still be followed for 
relapse and overall survival.  
8.1 Definitions of Adverse Events with  Commercially Available Agents  
This trial utilizes commercially available agents for transplant therapy for patients with 
hematological malignancies.  Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but 
obtained instead from a commercial sourc e.  In some cases, an agent obtained commercially may 
be used for indications not included in the package label.  In this case, the agent is still considered 
to be a commercial agent and the procedures described below should be followed.  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject whether or not it may have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE includes 
significant exacerbation of any baseline medical condition including, but not limit ed to, the disease 
under study. Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) the 
characteristics of the adverse event including the grade (severity); 2) the relationship to the study 
therapy (attribution); and 3) the prior experience  (expectedness) of the adverse event.  

UAB BMTCT Program                                                                                                                                              UAB 1285 - FluTBI                                                                                                                                    
      
                                                                                                                                                             Version 4.0, dated September 12, 2018  
 
Page 22 of 30  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of 
the agent.  For commercially available agents, an adverse event is considered unexpected, for 
reporting purposes only,  when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in 
either of the following:  
 The current NCI Agent -Specific Adverse Event List (provided in the Drug Information Section 
of this protocol).  
 The drug package insert (for treatments wi th commercially available agents).  
 
Except where otherwise specified, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
v.4 will be used to grade adverse events in this study.   
 
8.2 Required Adverse Events Reporting  
Therapy for ALL, with or without allo HCT, is associated with significant toxicity.  These 
toxicities are generally viewed as an anticipated consequence of therapy rather than an adverse 
event.  To summarize, adverse events with severity grades 1, 2, 3, and all expected grade 4 
toxicities will  not be reported to the IRB, as they are expected in patients undergoing allo HCT for 
ALL. Only unexpected grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity events with a possible, probable or 
definite relation to the study and all grade 5 events will be reported to IRB.  
8.3 Hematologic toxicity and Definition of Primary Engraftment Failure  
Failure to achieve a neutrophil count > 500/µL within 35 days of the stem cell infusion will be 
defined as primary engraftment failure and reported as an adverse event. If primary engraftme nt 
failure occurs, an action to obtain neutrophil recovery (such as the use of growth factors or stem 
cell boost) will be allowed. Neutrophil count recovery will continue to be monitored in these 
patients until they reach statistical endpoint.  
8.4 Serious Adv erse Event Reporting Procedures  
 All serious adverse events (SAE) which require reporting must be reported immediately (i.e.

Page 23 of 30 SAE) within 7 days of the PI’s knowledge of occurrence.  A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined 
as: Any adverse event (experience) occurring that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 
1) Death.  
 
2) A life-threatening adverse drug experience.  
 
3) Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
 
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
 
5) A congenital anomaly/birt h defect.  
 
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and ma y require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition (FDA, 21 CFR 
312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
The research staff of Bone Marrow Transplant -Cell Therapy (BMT -CT) Program will coordinate 
the reporting process between the investigators and IRB as well as other applicable reporting 
agencies (FDA, CTEP, and NIH). Copies of all correspondence and reporting documents will be 
maintained in a regulatory file held by the research staff of BMT -CT Program.  
9  Data Safety Monitoring  
9.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Procedures  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of The University of Alabama at Birmingham 
Comprehensive Cancer Center is the DSMB for this study.  This committee is responsible for the 
quarterly review and moni toring the study’s scientific progress, accrual rate and any serious 
adverse events.  
 
In addition to the Cancer Center DSMB, BMT -CT Program will form a Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for the study.  This committee will be composed of the PI, c o-
investigator(s), data manager or study coordinator and other members of the study staff involved 
UAB BMTCT Program                                                                                                                                              UAB 1285 - FluTBI                                                                                                                                    
      
                                                                                                                                                             Version 4.0, dated September 12, 2018  
 
Page 24 of 30 in the conduct of the trial.  During the committee’s quarterly meeting, the PI will discuss matters 
related to:  
Enrollment rate relative to expectations, cha racteristics of participants  
Safety of study participants (Serious Adverse Event & Adverse Event reporting)  
Adherence to protocol (protocol deviations)  
Completeness, validity and integrity of study data  
Retention of study participants  
 
These meetings are to be documented by data manager or study coordinator using the Protocol 
Specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report (DSMR), signed by the PI or co -investigator.   The 
completed DSMR is to be sent to DSMB.  
 
Similarly, protocol deviations are to be documented  using the Notice of Protocol Deviation Form 
and requires the signatures of either data manager or study coordinator and the PI or co -investigator. 
These reports are to be sent to the IRB within 7 calendar days of awareness of the event and on a 
quarterly basis to the DSMB with the Protocol Specific DSMR.  
 
9.2 Quality Assurance and Audits  
The Quality Assurance Review Committee (QARC) of The University of Alabama at Birmingham 
Comprehensive Cancer Center performs quality assurance audits of investigator -initiate d clinical 
trials. Audits provide assurance that trials are conducted in compliance with the protocol. Further, 
they ensure that study data are collected, documented and reported in compliance with Good 
Clinical Practices (GCP) Guidelines and regulatory re quirements.  
 
A QARC audit of each clinical trial is conducted annually. Audits occur within the month of the 
study’s initial IRB approval (provided the trial is open, and study accrual is greater than five 
subjects).  
 
All audit findings are reported by QAR C to the DSMB. These findings are followed -up by the 
DSMB until they have been resolved.

Page 25 of 30 The DSMB can also request QARC for a ‘for cause’ audit of the trial if the board identifies a need 
for a more rigorous evaluation of study -related issues.  
 
A regulat ory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to conduct an inspection of the study, during its 
conduct or even after its completion. If an inspection has been requested by a regulatory authority, 
the PI must immediately inform the IRB/DSMB that such a request ha s been made.

1. Karnofsky Performance Score will be assessed within 14 days prior to registration.  
2. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed within 35 days of registration to assess morphology and cytogenetics.  
3. If stem cell infusion requires more than one day, then the first day after the last stem cell infusion will be defined as day 1.  
4. A bone marrow aspirate will be collected whenever relapse is suspected. Patients that relapse will be followed for survival.  
5. Tacrolimus (0.03mg/kg/day) will be given starting day -3. Patients will convert to oral tacrolimus when tolerated. Tacrolimus will be continued till day + 100 and tapered if there  
are n o signs of active GVHD.

7. Acute GVHD will be assessed weekly (±3 days) till 100 days post -transpl ant. 
8. Chronic GVHD will be assessed monthly (±14 days) till 1 year post transplant.  
9. Fludarabine 40 mg/m2/day 
10. Total Body Irradiation 200cGy/fraction x 2 on days -3.-2 and -1.

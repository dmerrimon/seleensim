and take as much time as you need.  Please ask questions at any time about anything you do not 
understand. 
The principal investigator for this study is Dr. Alexander.  You should ask her, or a member of 
the study team, to explain any information in this informed consent that you do not understand.
Once you understand the study, you can decide if you want to take part in it. Your decision to 
participate, or not to participate, is entirely voluntary.  If you choose to take part, we will ask you 
to sign this form. We will give you a signed and dated copy of the consent form for your records.
If you are an employee  or student,  your employment  status  or academic  standing  at UMB  will 
not be affected  by your participation  or non-participation  in this study.
PURPOSE OF STUDY
Why is this research being done?
Since the identification of the HIV virus, much has been learned about the disease caused by this 
virus and, for people who are able to take their antiretroviral medications on a regular basis, the 
life expectancy is now what it would be for that person based upon his current age. 
In this study we are referring to young men who have sex with men as YMSM. In Baltimore and 
other US cities, HIV positive YMSM have not stayed in outpatient care or taken care of their 
HIV/AIDS the best way. HIV/AIDS clinics have tried a number of ways to keep YMSM coming 
to treatment, but we are going to try a new method.
This research is evaluating the response of both YMSM and HIV clinic staff when the staff 
members of the clinic are taught new skills.

Page 2 of 9The staff will learn to look at things from your point of view. We are doing this research to better
understand how to care for YMSM, a group that has been hard to get to come to clinic for 
treatment and take care of their health. We want to study how your relationships with the staff 
might make a difference in your mental health or quality of life.
If you  participate, you will be 1 of about 102 YMSM participants at this site; there are two sites 
for a total of approximately 204 YMSM participants. 
PROCEDURES
What will happen if you join this study?
If you  agree to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following things:
Baseline Visit
The baseline visit will take place at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) Institute of 
Human Virology Jacques Initiative Clinic or at the UMB Evelyn Jordan Center depending upon 
where you usually receive your healthcare. We will ask you to fill out a survey on a touchpad. 
The questions will be about your current health and medical history. Your name will not be 
connected with the answers. We will review your clinical medical chart to get laboratory results 
and diagnoses that will allow us to look for possible associations between this information and 
your answers to the survey.
Questionnaires:
You will be asked a series of questions about your health status and symptoms.  These questions 
will be given to you on a touch-pad screen; you will be able to listen to the questions read to you 
as well.  A member of the study team will be present to answer any questions you might have. 
We will ask you questions about your symptoms that you might have experienced such as pain, 
tiredness, depression (sad mood), anxiety, sleep problems; also about your current daily activity 
level and about your sexual history.  
Follow-up Visits
We will ask you to complete the same survey 1 more time over a 6-month period. This visit will 
be at the time of your regular appointment or at a time that is most convenient for you and will 
be about 4 to 6 months after your baseline visit. A member of the study team will be present to 
answer any questions you might have. We will review your clinic records just after your visit to 
obtain laboratory results and medications to compare with your study information. Other forms 
to be updated will include: your contact information, medication and medical history, and a 
HP-00058180 UM IRB Approval Date 3/22/2016

Page 3 of 9variety of questions about your symptoms and quality of life. Total time for the follow-up visit is 
approximately 30-60 minutes. 
How long will you be in the study?
You will be in this study for 6 months or until 1 follow-up survey is completed.

POTENTIAL RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:
What are the risks or discomforts of the study?
When filling out Questions or Questionnaires
You may get tired or bored when we are asking you questions or you are completing 
questionnaires. You do not have to answer any question you do not want to answer.  
If the  test of mental function indicates that you may have a medical condition related to difficulty 
thinking or forgetfulness (such as HIV associated neurocognitive disorder), you will be notified 
of this result and, with your permission, we will contact your physician and/or healthcare 
provider for further testing and treatment.  That follow-up healthcare will not be part of this 
research study.
If your  answers to the questions about depressed mood suggest severe depression, you will be 
notified of this result and, with your permission, we will contact your physician and/or healthcare 
provider for further testing and treatment.  This follow-up healthcare will not be part of this 
research study.

Page 4 of 9If you  indicate in your questionnaire answers that you are planning to hurt yourself, you will be 
referred for emergency medical care. 
Another risk  is that something you read or discuss in relationship to this study may cause you to 
worry. If this happens the staff is trained in methods for recognizing distress this might cause 
you and there is a “safety protocol” in place that will allow us to get you to an appropriate staff 
member or counselor experienced with this type of issue. You are also free to contact Dr. 
Alexander directly relative to this occurrence. Her telephone number is at the top of the consent 
form.
In any study, there  may be risks that are not yet known. 
Loss of Confidentiality
There is always a potential for the loss of confidentiality. This risk will be minimized by keeping 
all study data stored and secured in a locked cabinet in a locked office. Electronic data will be 
password protected and will not have your name on it.  Private information will only be given 
out as listed in the HIPAA form and only if necessary. We have also obtained a Certificate of 
Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health (see “Confidentiality and Access to 
Records” section below). 
Although we believe  that good research strategies for privacy make this unlikely, there is a risk 
that your identity could become re-connected with your health information.  If this happened - 
information could be revealed that could lead to denial of employment or insurance for you or a 
relative, or law enforcement agencies might be able to demand information about you in 
connection with an investigation. Our staff is trained to take steps to protect your confidentiality.
There may be risks in this study that are not known.
POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Are there benefits to being in the study?
It is not known whether you will benefit directly from your participation in this study. You may 
have no benefit from being in this study or you may benefit by having an improved treatment 
outcome, but there is no guarantee. You will talk with one extra person, the data collector at your 
study visit and this may assist you in remembering to address issues with your health team. Even 
if there is no direct benefit to you, the information collected in this study will help the research

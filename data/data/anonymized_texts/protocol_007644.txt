Study design  
An open label study with the aim to estimate the incidence of moderate and severe diarrhea among 
participants challenged with  Arne Parment, MD, PhD  of the E. coli E24377A strain . This dose is 
planned to be used in a subsequent challenge study of the efficacy of an Arne Parment, MD, PhD  
(ETVAX®). 
 
Objectives  
Primary objective 
To evaluate the moderate and severe diarrhea attack rate after challenge with wild type 
enterotoxigenic E. coli  (ETEC) strain E24377A 
 
Primary endpoint  
Moderate and severe diarrhea, as  defined by ≥ 4 grade 3 -5 stools or  > 400 grams of grade 3-5 stools 
passed with in a rolling 24-hour period, deemed attributable to ETEC .  
 Diarrhea episodes or ETEC symptoms beginning any time after challenge  through 120 hours post-
challenge may contribute toward the primary endpoint and will be followed to resolution. The end of a diarrheal episode occurs when a subject does not pass any grade 3 -5 stool within 24 hours. An  
adjudication committee will be used to judge if the diarrhea is attributable to ETEC and determin e if a 
subject meets the primary endpoint by considering individual data as described in the adjudication charter . 
 
  
Secondary objectives  
• To further evaluate the clinical features of the challenge with wild type enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) strain E24377A  
• To evaluate the safety of the challenge with wild type enterotoxigenic E. coli  (ETEC) strain 
E24377A

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
Number of subjects planned  
Up to  30 healthy subjects are planned to be enrolled in the study. Up to 32 subjects will be invited to 
the in -patient unit to ensure up to 30 are available for challenge.  
Diagnosis and eligibility criteria  
 
Inclusion  criteria:  
1. Healthy adults between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the informed 
consent . 
2. General good health, without clinically significant medical history, physical examination 
findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities per clinical judgment of PI.  
3. Negative pregnancy test at screening and prior to challenge for people  of childbearing 
potential. People  of childbearing potential must agree to use an efficacious hormonal or 
barrier method of birth control during the study. Abstinence is acceptable. People of childbearing potential  unable to bear children must have this documented (e.g. tubal ligation 
or hysterectomy) or must have negative pregnancy tests  at screening and prior to challenge . 
4. Willingness to participate in the study after all aspects of the protocol have been explained and written informed consent obtained.

and knowledge of ETEC associated illness by passing a written examination (70% pass 
score).  
6. Availability for the study duration, including planned follow -up visit /contact . 
Exclusion criteria:  
1. Presence of a significant medical or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the 
investigator precludes participation in the study, including gastrointestinal disease (gastritis, 
irritable bowel disease as suggested by Rome I II criteria or medical diagnosis, inflammatory 
bowel disease). Some medical conditions which are adequately treated and stable would not 
preclude entry into the study. These conditions might include stable asthma controlled with 
inhalers or mild hypertension stably controlled.  
2. Significant abnormalities in screening haematology or serum chemistry as determined by PI .  
3. Presence in the serum of HIV antibody, HBsAg, or HCV antibody with confirmation of infection (e.g. by HCV PCR) .

6. Subjects whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is less than 19.0 or greater than 37.0 (kg/m
2). 
7. Recent vaccination or receipt of an investigational product (within 30 days before challenge) 
or intended vaccination or receipt of investigational products until 60 days after challenge, 
with the exception of licensed vaccine for influenza or SARS -CoV -2 vaccination that may be 
given up to 7 days prior to challenge.  
8. Positive test for SARS -CoV -2 at arrival to the unit on the day of in -patient admission.   
9. Intention to donate blood or blood products within one month following the completion of 
study participation (note: The Red Cross will not allow blood donations for 1 year following 
participation in an investigational research study).  
10. Any other criteria which, in the investigator’s opinion, would compromise the ability of the 
subject to participate in the study, the safety of the study, or the results of the study .  
11. Abnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 per week or more than 3 per day).  
12. Regular (≥ weekly) use of laxatives, antacids, or other agents to lower stomach acidity.  
13. Use of any medication known to affect the immune function (e.g., corticosteroids and others) 
within 30 days preceding the challenge or planned use during the active study period. Use of 
inhaled or topical steroids may be permitted per PI discretion . 
14. History of microbiologically confirmed ETEC infection in the last 3 years .

blockers or antacids within 48 hours prior to challenge dosing.  
19. History of diarrhea in the 7 days prior to challenge (outpatient diarrhea is defined as ≥ 3 unformed (grade 3 or greater) loose stools in 24 hours). 
20. Known allergy to two of the three following antibiotics: ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and/or 
azithromycin .  
 
Methodology  
The study will consist of three study periods : screening, in -patient  period  and out -patient follow -up. 
Subjects will be evaluated for study eligibility during the screening period. After provision of written 
informed consent, subject eligibility for study entry will be assessed.  Subjects who have been  
assessed eligible for the s tudy, based on screening evaluations, w ill be admitted to the in -patient unit 
on Day - 1, the day before E24377A administration, for study orientation and to be monitored for any 
signs and symptoms of illness . At baseline (Day 1), subjects who will remain  eligible and  willing to 
participate w ill be  enrolled in the study and receive a single administration of E24377A. Subjects may  
remain  in the in -patient unit until Day 9  (routine discharge is scheduled for 8 days after challenge 
dependent upon 2 consecutive negative stool culture results) . During in- patient period, subjects w ill 
be examined on a daily basis for signs and symptoms of ETEC illness . Vital signs will be  measured at 
least 3 times daily  starting on Day 1, a nd postural blood pressure and pulse w ill be  measured as 
needed .  All stools will be  collected and evaluated, weighed, and graded by the study staff . Up to 
3 stools and/or rectal swabs each day w ill be  cultured .  
If the subject develops  any symptom suggestive of diarrhea, they will be encouraged to drink liquids . 
If a subject vomits  or is unable to consume an adequate volume of liquids, then intravenous (IV) 
fluids w ill be  administered.   
In order to reduce the risk of secondary infection after discharge, all subjects will receive a 3-day 
course of antibiotics.  The subject will beg in a 3- day course of ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth twice 
daily  (or azi thromycin 500 mg by mouth daily for three days , or amoxicillin 500 mg by mouth three 
times  daily for three days if the subject was allergic to ciprofloxacin) on the morning of Day 6, or 
sooner if the subject has met the criteria for early antibiotic treatment (see Section 9.4.8.2.)  
Subjects  will be discharged  from the in -patient unit if determined eligible for discharge . Subjects who 
meet the criteria for early antibiotic treatment,  may  be discharged from the in -patient unit earlier than 
anticipated  upon meet ing discharge criteria.  Discharge criteria include at least 2  stools negative for 
the challenge organism , having taken at least 2 doses of antibiotics, and have improvement or 
resolution of  symptoms.    
After discharge from the in -patient unit, all subjects will attend  the scheduled follow -up visit /contact  
on an out -patient basis on  Day 29 (physical visit) and Day 180 ( phone) .

a screening period of up to 60 days , a 5- 10 day in- patient  period  and 26 weeks (approximately 6 
months) follow -up after challenge.  
 
Efficacy assessments  
Clinical indicators will include the incidence, severity, and time to onset of diarrhea, the incidence 
and duration of positive stool cultures, the incidence of moderate and  severe ETEC illness, evaluation 
of the number and weight of grade 3 -5 stools, and the incidence of malaise, loss of appetite, 
headache, chills, fever, nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal cramps, myalgia, arthralgia, urgency of 
defecation , vomiting and lightheadedness .   
Stool grading criteria: grade 1 = firm, formed; grade 2 = soft but still formed; grade 3 = thick liquid; 
grade 4 = thin liquid; grade 5 =  clear or translucent, watery . 
   
Safety assessments  
Safety evaluations w ill include documentation of adverse events  and key vital sign measurements.

7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Project background  
Enterotoxigenic E scherichia  coli (ETEC) bacteria cause considerable physical suffering and 
malnutrition due to repeated bouts of illness in children in low- and middle-income countries 
(LMIC). Diarrhea is the second -leading cause of death among children <5 years of age 
worldwide. The actual  mortality numbers are difficult to estimate ; global annual incidences of 
nearly 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrheal disease with approximately 500 000 – 700 000 deaths in children <5 years of age have been presented  [1, 2]. The relative importance of ETEC 
versus other diarrheal pathogens for the total burden of diarrheal disease is debated  [2, 3]. 
However, the significant morbidity  caused by ETEC in young children is undisputed, and it is 
also clear that repeated ETEC episodes have significant impact on growth and mental development [ 4, 5, 6]. WHO’s PDVAC  (Product Development for Vacci nes C ommittee ) has 
2020 proclaimed that an ETEC vaccine is a high priority for LMIC s [4, 5]. A vaccine against 
ETEC would have a significant impact on travelers as well. Prior to the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 500-600 million people traveled annually to LMICs [ 7]. Traveling to LMIC involves 
a risk of travel -related diseases and at least 35 million travelers per year are affected by travelers’ 
diarrhea (TD) [ 8, 9]. ETEC is the major cause of TD, responsible for approximately 15 million 
annual cases  [8, 9].   
ETEC spreads through the fecal-oral route. Infection occurs when a person ingests food or liquid contaminated with ETEC bacteria. Human waste (e.g. feces) is  the ultimate source of ETEC 
contamination. ETEC can adhere to the mucosal epithelial cells lining the small intestine using coloniz ation factors (CF , also called coli surface antigens, CS) [ 6]. Once attached to the mucosal 
surface, the bacterium starts to produce a heat  labile (LT) and/or a heat stable toxin (ST) 
  Clinical Study Protocol / OEV-131

triggering diarrhea. The LT toxin is highly homologous to the cholera toxin (CT) and causes 
diarrhea via a highly similar mechanisms [ 6]. 
ETVAX® is Arne Parment, MD, PhD  ETVAX® is currently in late phase development and has 
been studied in several clinical phase 1 and 2b studies. Successfully completed clinical studies have shown that the vaccine is safe and immunogenic, giving rise to mucosal IgA responses to all vaccine CFs and to LTB, both in children living in endemic areas, as well as in Western healthy adults [
11, 12, 13 , 14, 15]. Our previous results also demonstrate that the vaccine gives 
rise to memory B cell responses that can be detected until at least 2 years after vaccination and that such long- term immunity may be reflected by the circulation of activated follicular helper T 
cells early after immunization  [13, 16]. 
The product formulation of ETVAX® Arne Parment, MD, PhD  has been established. In the Arne 
Parment, MD, PhD  are mixed with the buffer salts  and stabilizing excipients in a sachet. In 
preparation of the partially dried formulation , the content of the Arne Parment, MD, PhD  is 
dissolved in 150 ml of tap water, followed by the addition of the vaccine vial content (inactivated bacteria). The new product formulation is thus very simple to prepare and suitable for use in the field.  A two -armed, non-inferiority, immunogenicity and safety study in 280 adult volunteers at 
one study site in Sweden  comparing the two formulations, has recently  been completed . The 
noninferiority margin  was set to -15% (on an absolute scale ). The study demonstrated that the 
new partially dried formulation is noninferior in eliciting an immune response to LTB compared to the old wet formulation. The seroconversion rate was 83% and 85% in the partially dried formulation and wet formulation respectively with a 95% conf idence interval for the difference 
between the seroconversion rates of ( -11%, 7% ). The  results show that the new partially dried 
vaccine formulation was safe and well tolerated  [
17].  
A pivotal phase 3 study to demonstrate efficacy to support licensure for the travelers’ diarrhea indication is currently planned using a Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM). In 
preparation for the p hase 3  CHIM study, this pre -study will be performed to estimate the 
incidence of moderate and  severe diarrhea among participants challenged with  
4x109 cfu of the 
ETEC  strain  E24377A. Arne Parment, MD, PhD  This CHIM study is designed to demonstrate 
the protective efficacy of ETVAX® and to collect additional safety and immunogenicity data.  
7.2 Challenge strain E24377A  
The ETEC strain E24377A expresses the CS1 and CS3, as well as the STh (a subtype of the ST 
toxin) and LT enterotoxins. The strain also expresses the O139 Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS) antigen 
and H28 flagella. E24377A was, in the early 1980s, isolated from a traveler returning from Egypt with an ETEC diarrheal illness [ 18], and it shares the CS3 and LT antigens with one of the E. coli  
strains in the ETVAX
® vaccine but is of a different O and H antigen type. The CS1+CS3 CF 
combination of virulence factors are well-represented in field isolates and contribute to virulence , 
infectivity , and disease severity throughout the world. They are seen in ETEC strains causing 
disease in both adults and children globally [ 19]. The ETEC strain E24377A has been fully DNA 
sequenced  [20, 21], including a comparative genomic analysis of E. coli  commensal and 
pathogenic isolates [ 20]. 
The E24377A (lot 0807) challenge strain was manufactured under current Good Manufacturing 
practice ( cGMP ) on August 31, 2000 and released 17 April, 2001 for use in a CHIM study.

Confidential  17 (67) Template Version:30MAR2020  
  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
For th is pre -study and the  planned CHIM study involving the ETVAX® vaccine, the E24377A 
ETEC strain is considered to be the best suited as  (a) there is a fair amount of experience with 
E24377A (third most commonly used challenge strain [ 22], (b) the disease severity score is 
predominantly moderate [ 23] and (c) the time to diarrhea is with a median of 25 hours post -
challenge, also intermediate compared to common ETEC challenge strains (e.g. 47 hours for 
H10407 and 13 hours for B7A) and, therefore well -suited for a 5- 10 day in- house challenge period 
[23]. The E24377A strain has also been used in prior vaccination -challenge studies  [18, 24, 25, 
26, 27, 28] , see Section 9.2.   
The 0807 GMP lot of the ETEC E24377A strain has been used in previous CHIM studies to assess 
the efficacy of other candidate ETEC vaccines [18, 24]. Challenge doses ranging from 6x108 to 
4x109 were used with overall diarrheal rates of approximately 80% and with moderate- to-severe 
diarrhea  rates of 60-81%.  This planned  pre-study will be conducted with the aim to estimate the 
incidence of moderate and severe diarrhea among participants challenged with 4x109 cfu of the  
E24377A strain.     
7.3 Risk/benefit assessment  
7.3.1 Benefits  
Study subjects will have no direct benefit from study participation. However, subjects will receive 
a free health check -up and there is a potential future societal benefit should the outcome of this 
study lead to a subsequent vaccination and challenge study resulting in a vaccine able to prevent 
TD caused by ETEC.   
7.3.2 Risks 
Risks Associated with  ETEC Infection: The main risk is also the  primary objective in this study : 
diarrhea caused by ETEC.  Infection  with ETEC can cause profuse watery diarrhea, abdominal 
cramping , abdominal pain, malaise, headache,  urgency of defecation, lightheadedness and/or 
dehydration. Fever, nausea with or without vomiting, chills, loss of appetite, muscle aches and 
bloating can also occur but are less common. Illness develops 1-3 days after exposure and 
usually lasts 3 -4 days [ 29] without treatment , but generally improves within 24 hours of 
antibiotic therapy .  
In order to  reduce the risk of secondary infection after discharge, all subjects in the study will 
receive a 3 -day course of antibiotics starting no later than Day 6. Ciprofloxacin is the first- line 
antibiotic treatment for all subjects . If a subject is unable or unwilling to take cipro floxacin, 
azithrom ycin or amoxicillin will be used instead. The risk of diarrhea complications will be 
minimized by a conservative approach to timing of antibiotic administration, well within an 
interval that has been shown to be efficacious, as well as daily clinical monitoring. Stool output will be closely monito red. 
 
Risks Associated with Post- Infectious Irritable Bowel Syndrome (PI -IBS): Recent studies also 
suggest an increased risk of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) following bacterial enteritis, and infection with ETEC has been found to be associated with these sequelae. A long duration (>2 weeks) of TD has been shown to be a risk factor for development of PI- IBS 
[30]. P rompt treatment of the ETEC  infection , as done in the present study, cuts the duration of 
  Clinical Study Protocol /  OEV- 131 
Version 3.0/ 23-FEB- 2024

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
any ETEC illness short and thus most likely eliminates the risk of PI -IBS. Symptoms of PI -IBS 
will be screened for with the Functional Bowel Disorder Survey (FBS) administered on study 
day 180. A study provider will review each FBS. Any participant identified as having a risk for PI-IBS will be referred for follow -up care.  PI-IBS may be detected in 3 -17% of people who 
experience travelers diarrhea (TD)  [9], however there have been no documented cases of PI -IBS 
in enteric c hallenge study participants  [31] . 
Risks Associated with Antibiotics: Therapeutic antibiotics for use in this study are licensed, approved medications that have been used extensively, and shown to be very safe with only rare side effects. The most commonly reported side effects for ciprofloxacin are gastrointestinal symptoms  (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) in as many as 5 persons in 100. Other reported 
symptoms in less than 1 person in 100 include rash, dizziness, and headache. Rarely, allergic reactions to these medications have been obser ved. Ciprofloxacin is not recommended for use in 
pregnancy due to concerns of joint damage to the unborn child (based on studies in young animals). Pregnancy is exclusionary for study participation and is documented through testing prior to study intervent ions and provided discussion on methods to prevent pregnancy during 
study. Fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, are associated with an increased risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture in all ages. The risk of developing fluoroquinolone -associated 
tendonitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients, usually over 60 years of age, 
in patients taking corticosteroid drugs, and in patients with kidney, heart, or lung transplants, all of whom are excluded from this study. Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD/ 
pseudomembranous colitis) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents. 
Subjects will not be discharged until they are well and have had at least two  conse cutive  stool 
cultures negative for the challenge strain . Both stool cultures may be from the same day. 
Approximately 6 months after challenge , all subjects will have a follow -up contact by telephone 
to inquire about the occurrence of any new chronic illnesses or serious adverse event s.    
Risks Associated with SARS -CoV -2 Exposure and Risk Mitigation : The risk that the COVID -19 
pandemic will influence the possibility to perform the study according to plan, or influence the 
results of the study, will be  continuously assessed by the study team. Since  the subjects are 
planned to be enrolled in Q 1 2024, when a majority of the adult US population will have been 
vaccinated or infected with SARS -CoV -2, the risk that the pandemic will have major influence 
on the study is deemed to be small.  
It is the intent of the Center for Immunization Research (CIR) to mitigate risk and provide a safe 
environment for participants while they are inpatient on the unit during the study. The CIR will 
educate and encourage all potential study volunteers to be fully vaccinated with one of the COVID licensed/EUA vaccines pri or to enrolling in this study. Volunteers will not be required to 
be vaccinated against SARS -CoV -2, however , vaccinated volunteers will be prioritized for 
enrollment.  
The CIR will follow recommendations from the CDC when implementing clinical trials. The CIR will also follow institutional guidelines and policies. Current recommendations include vaccination with one of the licensed/EUA vaccines for all adults.  
Volunteers will be educated on the risks of not being vaccinated. They will sign a disclaimer 
regarding vaccination status and possible exposure to the virus. V olunteers will be strongly 
encouraged to wear a mask and maintain social distance from others.

Confidential  19 (67) Template Version:30MAR2020  
  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
 
Depending on the level of COVID illness in the community and current CDC and JHU guidelines, volunteers may be asked to obtain a COVID -19 test 1- 5 days prior to admission. All 
volunteers will be screened for symptoms and tested on arrival to the unit on the day of inpatient admission. Potential volunteers who test positive for SARS -CoV -2 will not be eligible for 
enrollment.  
Risks Associated with Venipuncture and IV  fluid administration : Blood sampling of study 
participants may cause pain at the time of sample collection and may result in the development of bruising, bleeding, lightheadedness, syncope (rarely) and infection (rarely). Intravenous catheters may additionally infiltrate and ca use swelling and/or discomfort. 
Risks Associated with Stool Collection: There are no risks associated with the collection of stool samples. However, participants may be asked to provide up to three rectal swabs per inpatient day as needed. Risks of using rectal swabs could include mild discomfort, embarrassment, and (very rarely) bleeding or irritation. 
Risks Associated with Transmission of Challenge  strain : This ETEC  strain has the potential for 
risk to both the environment and to the research personnel; however, the risk to the environment 
in regard to potential transmission outside of the CIR  facility is low. The risk to the environment 
will be reduced by:  
 ensuring that all human waste products from inpatients are disinfected with bleach prior to disposal ,  
 emphasizing the importance of  handwashing for participants and staff ,  
 ensuring proper disposal/cleaning of linen,  
 ensuring participants will not be discharged until they are no longer shedding the challenge strain, as per procedures outlined in the protocol . 
Risks Associated with Isolation: Volunteers may feel bored or anxious about not being able to leave the unit or being separated from family, friends, and community while they are on the unit. The unit will be staffed 24/7 with medical staff and overnight with security staff. There will be planned activities in which the subjects can participate . There are big screen TVs throughout the 
unit as well as  games, and a kitchen and dining area.  
Risks Associated with Laboratory Results: There may be physical, psychological, and social risks if participants test positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and/or HIV. Participants testing positive will be counseled and referred for treatment. 
Risks Associated with Breach of Confidentiality:  All data and medical information obtained 
about participants will be considered privileged and held in confidence. A breach of 
confidentiality in which private health information is made public is possible . Participants will 
not be identified by name in any published report/presentation of the results. The Sponsor , their 
delegates,  and the FDA may inspect the records of this research as part of their responsibility to 
oversee research and ensure protection of participants. Study results and data may be published in scientific/medical journals; the identity of individual participants  will not be disclosed.

Moderate and severe diarrhea, as  defined by ≥ 4 grade 3- 5 stools or  > 400 grams of grade 3- 5 
stools passed with in a rolling 24- hour period, deemed attributable to ETEC .  
 Diarrhea  episodes or ETEC symptoms beginning any time after challenge through 120 hours 
post-challenge may contribute toward the primary endpoint and will be followed to  resolution. 
The end of a diarrheal episode occurs when a subject does not pass any grade 3- 5 stool within 24

• Number of colony forming units (cfu) per gram of stool of the E24377A challenge strain on D ays 2 and 4 after challenge 
9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
 This is an open label study with the aim to estimate the incidence of moderate and  severe 
diarrhea among participants challenged with 4x109 cfu of the E. coli E24377A strain. Arne 
Parment, MD, PhD 
The study will be conducted at one site; the Center for Immuni zation Research, Johns Hopkins 
Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, M aryland , United States.  
Up to  30 (minimum 25) subjects will be enrolled and challenged with approximately 4x109 cfu 
of the E. coli E24377A strain. 
Overall description of study design 
The study will consist of three study periods: screening, inpatient period and outpatient follow-
up. Subjects will be evaluated for study eligibility during the screening period. After provision of written informed consent, subject eligibility for study entry will be assessed.  Subjects who have been  assessed to be eligible for the study, based on screening evaluations, will be admitted to the 
in-patient unit on Day -1, the day before E24377A administration, for study orientation and to be 
monitored for any signs and symptoms of illness. At baseline (Day  1), subjects who remain 
eligible and  are willing to participate will be enrolled in the study and receive a single 
administration of E24377A.  
Subjects may  remain in the in -patient unit until they meet discharge criteria, see Section 9.4.8.2. 
Routine discharge is scheduled for Day 9, dependent upon 2 consecutive negative stool culture 
results.  During the in -patient period, subjects will be examined daily  for signs and symptoms of 
ETEC illness . Vital signs will be measured at least 3 times daily  starting on Day 1, and postural 
blood pressure and pulse will be measured as needed . All stools will be collected and evaluated, 
weighed, and graded by the study staff . Up to 3 stools and/or rectal swabs  collected each day will 
be cultured .   
If the subject develops any symptom suggestive of diarrhea, they will be encouraged to drink liquids. If a subject vomits  or is  unable to consume an adequate volume of liquids, then 
intravenous (IV) fluids may be administered.   
In order to  reduce the risk of secondary infection after discharge, all subjects will receive a 3 -day 
course of antibiotics. The subject will begin a 3-day course of ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth 
twice daily (or azithromycin 500 mg by mouth daily for three days, or amoxicillin 500 mg by mouth three times daily for three days if the subject was allergic to or unwilling to take

ciprofloxacin per the PI discretion ) on the morning of  Day  6, or sooner if the subject has met  the 
criteria for early antibiotic treatment (see Section 9.4.8.2). 
Subjects  will be discharged from the in -patient unit if determined eligible for discharge  (2 stools 
negative for the challenge organism by culture, having received at least 2 doses of antibiotics, 
with improvement or resolution of  symptoms) . Subjects who meet the criteria for early antibiotic 
treatment, may be discharged from the in- patient unit prior to Day  9.   
After discharge from the in- patient unit, all subjects will attend the scheduled follow -up 
visit/contact on an out -patient basis on Day 29 (physical visit) and Day 180  (phone) .  
The analyses for the exploratory endpoints may continue after the study database has been 
locked .

9.1.1 Stopping rules /Discontinuation Criteria  
Scandinavian Biopharma AB has the right to close the study at any time, although this should 
occur only after consulting involved parties. The I RB and the FDA must be informed. Events 
that may trigger premature termination of the  study include, but are not limited to: safety 
reasons, results of any interim analysis, non- compliance with the protocol, change in 
development plans for the subsequent planned vaccination and challenge study, slow recruitment  
and poor quality data.  
9.1.2 Internal Safety Review Committee (iSRC)  
There will be no iSRC for this study. 
9.2 Rationale for study  design, doses and control group  
For th is pre -study and the planned CHIM study involving the ETVAX® vaccine, the E24377A 
ETEC strain is considered to be the best suited as (a) there is a fair amount of experience with 
E24377A (third most commonly used challenge strain [ 22], (b) the disease severity score is 
predominantly moderate [23] and (c) the time to diarrhea is with a median of 25 hours post -

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
challenge also intermediate compared to  common ETEC challenge strains (e.g. 47 hours for 
H10407 and 13 hours for B7A) and, therefore well suited for a 5-10 day in-house challenge 
period [ 23].  
The 0807 GMP lot of the ETEC E24377A strain has been used in previous CHIM studies to assess the efficacy of other candidate ETEC vaccines [ 18, 24]. The E. coli ETEC strain E24377A 
was first used in human challenge studies in the early 1980s [ 25]. Table 2  below presents a 
summary of the previous use of the selected challenge strain E24377A ( E. coli  O139: H28; LT
+ 
ST+; CS1+  CS3) in CHIM studies. Challenge doses ranging from 6x108 to 4x109 were used with 
overall diarrheal attack rates around 80%  and moderate to  severe ETEC illness around 60-81 %. 
The pre-study to precede the proposed CHIM study is planned to estimate the incidence of 
moderate and  severe diarrhea among participants challenged with 4x109 cfu of the E. coli 
E24377A strain.   
No serious adverse events occurred in any of the studies listed in Table 2. Table 2. Strain E24377A used in CHIM studies

severe GI symptoms ) [18, 24]  
 
E24377A was, in the early 1980s, isolated from a traveler returning from Egypt with an ETEC 
diarrheal illness  [18], and it shares the CS3 and LT antigens with one of the E. coli  strains the 
ETVAX® vaccine but is of a different O and H antigen type. E24377A harbors two colonization 
factors, CS1 and CS3, as well as the enterotoxins LT and STh.  Since not only the colonization 
factors (CS1, CS3) and toxins (LT, ST) are expressed but also other common virulence factors 
(data on file from bioinformatic analysis performed Arne Parment, MD, PhD  E24377A is 
considered a representative strain for conducting a CHIM study involving the ETVAX® vaccine.   
The CS1+CS3 CF combination of virulence factors are well -represented in field isolates and 
contribute to virulence/infectivity/disease severity throughout the world. They are seen in ETEC 
strains causing disease in both adults and children globally [ 19].  A detailed analysis of the genes

encoding CS1, CS3, LT and ST in E24377A show that they are identical or highly similar 
(>99%) in comparison to the respective genes in other CS1+CS3 ETEC strains.   
Provoked diarrheal illnesses after challenge in studies with the same preparation (lot 0807) of 
strain E24377A are presented in Table 3. The cGMP grade preparation of the ETEC strain E24377A (lot 0807) has been used in previous CHIM studies [ 18, 24] , and triggered at doses of 
6x10
8 – 4x109 moderate to severe ETEC illness  of 60- 81% (Table 2).

9.3.1 Recruitment  
The study site will recruit subjects from the greater Baltimore , Washington DC and surrounding 
regions .  
IRB approved a dvertising will be  conducted utilizing  a wide range of print, electronic, audio, 
video and /or social media. Subjects responding to the advertisements by a phone call or through 
the website  will be pre -screened for eligibility base d on a standard pre -screening questionnaire 
administered by a  CIR recruiter . Some elements of the inclusion/ exclusion criteria will be

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
discussed with the subject  at that time and a preliminary assessment will be made regarding the 
individual´s eligibility for study participation.  
9.3.2 Compensation for participation 
Compensation will occur as detailed below. Compensation will be provided only for completed 
study procedures designated for compensatory payment. If a participant is eligible to participate in the investigational protocol after screening, and completes all  study visits, procedures and 
follows all the rules, they will receive a total of $3,860.  
Volunteers that present to the unit as an alternate , but are not admitted , will receive $200 for 
screening and $200 for presenting to the unit (a total of $400). Volunteers who are admitted to 
the unit  overnight , but are discharged prior to challenge, will receive $200 for screening (if not 
already received) and $350 for staying on the inpatient unit  overnight .  
If a participant is not eligible for discharge by Day 9 because of illness or not having 2 
consecutive negative stool culture results they will receive $350 per additional inpatient day.   
9.3.3 Screening according to protocol CIR200        
Initial in -person screenings will be conducted under a separate, IRB -Approved general screening 
protocol (“Screening of adult volunteers for eligibility to participate in clinical studies evaluating 
investigational vaccines, antimicrobial agents, other disease prevention measures or the pathogenesis of infectious agents” CIR 200, JHSPH IRB 00010083). Subjects will be made aware that the screening process may take several visits to complete. 
 
Using this screening protocol, a medical history/physical exam and a series of clinical laboratory tests may be completed to rule out occult illness and pregnancy. These laboratory tests may include, but are not limited to, complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistries, hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C antibody, HIV -1 antibody, IgA levels, serum hCG (fo r people  of 
childbearing potential), and urine toxicology (drug screening). (Confirmatory testing will be performed on participants who test positive for hepatitis C or HIV -1 antigens.) Participants who 
have ≤ 2 mild (grade 1) non- hematologic abnormalities may be included if the PI determines that 
their participation will not present undue risk to the participant. Participants with > 2 mild abnormalities will not be included in the study. Participants with clinical laboratory abnormalities of greater than mild severity will not participate in this clinical trial. The clinical toxicity grading scale that will be used as a guideline is based on the scale used by the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) for adverse events and the guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. If any additional safety labs are performed, either scale may be utilized.  
Participants who are eligible after completing the general screening assessment  may be asked to 
complete study- specific screening under this  protocol. 
9.3.4 Number of subjects  
Up to 30 (minimum 25) healthy subjects will be enrolled in the study. Since the re is a maximum 
capacity of 30 subjects for the in -patient period, the number of subjects who receive the 
  Clinical Study Protocol /  OEV- 131

E24377A strain will not exceed 30; however, additional alternate subjects may be recruited to fill 
in for subjects who are ineligible or chose to leave prior to challenge receipt.  
9.3.5 Screening and enrol lment log  
The clinic will keep a log of all subjects screened and enrolled . The reason for screen failure 
should be stated for all subjects screened but not enrolled . The reason for withdrawal should be 
stated for all subjects enrolled  but not completed. 
Subjects who have signed the CIR 200 ICF will be assigned a CIR 200 screening number. 
Subjects who sign the study specific consent form will be assigned a study specific subject 
number. 
9.3.6 Inclusion criteria  
For inclusion in the study, subjects must fulfil all the following criteria:  
1. Healthy adults between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive, at the time of signing the 
informed consent .

for the protocol -specified period (i.e., until they meet discharge criteria of 2 stools negative for 
challenge; see Section  9.4.8.2) and return for the scheduled out -patient study site visit on Day 29, 
and be available for a final contact by phone approximately 6 months after challenge . 
Furthermore, subjects w ill be encouraged to take the full course of antibiotics in order to reduce 
the risk of secondary infect ion after discharge.   
If a subject expresses interest in withdrawing from the study after E24377A administration but 
before completion of the in- patient  period, then the subject w ill be started on antibiotic therapy 
and encouraged to remain in the in- patient unit until they are no longer infected, as determined 
by negative stool culture.  If the participant is amendable to returning for any or all in -person 
outpatient visits, they will be considered “off treatment” but not terminated from the study.  
However, if the subject elect s to withdraw from the study immediately, then the subject w ill 
receive a single dose of ciprofloxacin 500 mg prior to discharge from the in -patient unit and be 
provided with the remaining 5 doses of ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily ( BID). They will be 
encouraged to bring stools samples in to ensure clearance of the challenge organism.   
If a subject terminates the study before Day 29, every effort will be made to have the subject 
undergo the procedures as described in Section 9.5.6.4 for the follow -up visit.  
In case an early termination visit as described above is not possible, a follow -up safety phone 
call should be made as soon as possible after termination to capture any SAEs or AESIs  since 
the last study visit, if possible.  
9.4 Treatments  
9.4.1 Identity of Test Product  
The E24377A (lot 0807) challenge strain was manufactur ed and supplied by Walter Reed Army 
Institute of Research (WRAIR), Biological Production Facility, Silver Spring, MD, (MF 11636). Under current Good Manufacturing practice  (cGMP) on August 31, 2000 and released on April 
17, 2001 for use in a CHIM study. Vials of the WRAIR Production Cell Bank have been stored (at -80
o C +10o C) at the WRAIR Pilot BioProduction  Facility since their cGMP manufacture.  
Further testing of the challenge strain to re -confirm its characteristics has been  performed to 
fulfill current quality and purity standards.  
For the purposes of this study, all subjects will be challenged with an inoculum prepared by the CIR JHSPH Enteric Vaccine Research Lab under the supervision of the Investigational Drug Service (IDS) from freshly plated, grown organisms. This approach was used in all previously conducted clinical studies in which the E2477A challenge strain was used. Details of the challenge strain preparation are provided in the Study Specific Procedure CIR357 – SSP 001.  
9.4.2 Packaging, labelling and storage of test product  
Following receipt of the frozen challenge strain from WRAIR, it will be stored at the  CIR 
JHSPH Enteric Vaccine Research Lab in accordance with GCP and GMP requirements and will 
be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
9.4.3 Administration of Challenge strain E23477A   
Each subject will receive a single administration of approximately 4 x109 cfu of the ETEC strain 
E24377A (lot 0807)  by mouth at baseline (Day 1).  
A sod ium bicarbonate buffer solution of 2 g/150 mL water will be prepared by research lab staff 
under the supervision of a n IDS pharmacist . Each subject will drink 120 mL of th is sodium 
bicarbonate buffer ( in order to neutralize gastric acidity ) one to two minute s prior to ingesting 
the challenge inoculum . Ther eafter, subjects will drink the challenge inoculum ( approximately 4 
x109 cfu) dissolved in the remaining 30 mL of buffer .   
All subjects will be fasted for approximately 90 minutes before challenge and for approximately 
90 minutes after challenge.  
9.4.4 Product accountability  
The study site will maintain a Challenge Dispensing document in each participant chart  detailing 
the dates and quantities of challenge administration  to each subject . Records will be maintained 
that includes subject number , administration date and amount administered. This documentation 
will be available to the design ated CRA to verify test product accountability during the study.  
Any unused challenge strain will be accounted for and destroyed as per Sponsor and SSP 
instructions.

others) within 30 days preceding the challenge or planned use during the active study period. Use of inhaled or topical steroids may be permitted per PI discretion . 
• Vaccination for or ingestion of ETEC, cholera, or LT toxin within 5 years prior to 
dosing.          
• Use of antibiotics during the 14 days before challenge dosing or proton pump inhibitors, 
H2 blockers or antacids within 48 hours prior to challenge dosing. 
9.4.8.2 Concomitant therapy during the st udy 
During the study, all subjects will receive a 3 -day course of antibiotics.    
On the morning of Day 6  (or sooner if the subject met the criteria for early antibiotic treatment; 
see below), all subjects w ill start a 3 -day course of ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID.   
Subjects with an allergy to or who are unwilling to take a fluoroquinolone , may receive 
azithromycin  500 mg by mouth daily for three days  or amoxicillin  500 mg by mouth three times 
daily for three days .  
If, because of illness, a subject is unable to take oral antibiotics, intravenous antibiotics may be 
given at an appropriate dose based on weight and clinical status.     
Criteria for early antibiotic treatment 
Subjects meeting any of the following criteria before Day 6 will start antibiotic treatment at that 
time: 
• Severe diarrhea as defined as >800 grams of grade 3- 5 stools  within a rolling 24 hour -
period (see Section 9.5.3.1.2).  
• Stool output consistent with moderate diarrhea for 48 hours  
• Diarrhea of any severity AND 2 or more of the following symptoms: severe abdominal 
pain, severe abdominal cramps, severe nausea, severe headache, severe myalgias, severe 
arthralgia), any fever (≥ 100.4°F, 38.0°C), or any vomiting  
• Any fever ≥ 102.1 °F (39.0°C ) 
• A study clinician determines early treatment is warranted for any other reason  
Subjects who meet the criteria for early antibiotic treatment, may be discharged from the in -
patient unit earlier than anticipated upon meeting discharge criteria. Discharge criteria include at 
least 2 stools negative for the challenge organism, having taken at least 2 doses of antibiotics, 
and have no or improved symptoms.    
Subjects  taking any other non- antibiotic medication on a chronic basis may continue with that 
medication unless directed otherwise by a study clinician. All such medication will be collected 
on admission to the inpatient facility and will be dispensed by study staff until discharge.  
Rehydration 
Subjects passing grade 3- 5 stools post -challenge will be asked to drink liquids , at the same 
volume as their stool  output.  
A subject may be administered IV fluids if they:  
  Clinical Study Protocol /  OEV- 131 
Version 3.0/ 23-FEB- 2024 
                    
Confidential  34 (67) Template Version:30MAR2020  
  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
• Experience abrupt onset of diarrhea, defined as passage of an initial loose/liquid stool of 
>300 g, or >400 g of loose/liquid stools over 2 hours in conjunction with other symptoms, as determined by PI or designee . 
• Become hypovolemic, defined as confirmed supine systolic blood pressure (BP) < 90 
mmHg and associated symptoms, or significant light -headedness on standing, with a 
confirmed postural change in BP or pulse . 
• A decrease in systolic BP or diastolic BP of > 20 mmHg or increase in pulse of > 30 beats/minute takes place when measured lying down vs. two minutes after standing. 
• If determined necessary by the study provider , e.g., diarrhea with nausea/vomiting and 
unable to drink enough to keep up with output, or other reason. 
All concomitant medications  administered including antibiotics and IV fluids will be 
documented in the subject ´s medical record and in the eCRF.        
Treatment for Vomiting  
Treatment for severe nausea or vomiting may be needed. Participants who experience severe 
nausea or vomiting may be given oral or intravenous (IV) ondansetron (Zofran).  
Treatment for Fever or Pain  
Acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen may be used to treat fever or pain.  
Other Treatments  
In addition to above medications , other medications may be prescribed by the PI or designees, as 
needed for symptom control (e.g., heartburn), or if a medical problem arises (allergic reaction, insomnia). The most commonly utilized medication, including the indication are as follows:

9.5 Study  assessments  
The timing and frequency of study visits and assessments are presented in the schedule of events 
in Table 1. 
Each study assessment /procedure  is described in the sections below.  
9.5.1 Demographics and other baseline characteristics   
9.5.1.1 Demographic information 
Demographic and baseline clinical data including date of birth, biological sex, gender, race, 
height, weight, body mass index (BMI), pulse rate, blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)  and 
temperature will be recorded . In addition, information about previous SARS -CoV -2 vaccinations 
is collected from all participants.     
9.5.1.2 Medical history  
Medical  history will be obtained in order to verify that the eligibility criteria are met. Medical 
records will not be requested unless there is a need to clarify a question in the participant ’s 
medical history or if the participant had an intercurrent illness or injury requiring medical care 
during the study. Informed consent for the medical release will be obtained from each participant during screening. 
 
9.5.2 Safety assessments  
9.5.2.1 Adverse E vents  
9.5.2.1.1 Definitions  
 Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is  any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject  administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically  
significant abnormal values from  relevant tests, such as vital signs), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associated  with the use of a n investigational product , regardless of whether it is 
considered  related to the investigational product . 
In this study the challenge strain is considered to be an investigational product  and the causal 
relationship to the ingestion of the challenge strain  will be assessed.   
 In addition, the causal relationship between an AE and treatment with antibiotics (not an investigational product) and/or  study procedures will be assessed.        
 Clarifications:  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an ac ute appendicitis that begins 
  Clinical Study Protocol /  OEV- 131 
Version 3.0/ 23-FEB- 2024 
                    
Confidential  36 (67) Template Version:30MAR2020  
  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
during the AE reporting period should be reported as “acute appendicitis” and the resulting 
appendectomy noticed under Comments .  
Stable, p re-existing conditions  and/or  elective procedures  are not AEs (including any not 
recognized or not reported prior to study entry) and will be recorded in the Medical 
History.   
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any  AE that : 
− results in death  
− is life -threatening (this refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the  
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death  had it been more severe)  
− requires inpatient hospitali zation or prolongation of existing hospitali zation1  
− results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity2  
− is a congenital anomaly/birth defect3   
− is medically  important (this  refers to an event that may  not be immediately  life-
threatening  or result in death or hospitali zation, but may jeopardi ze the subject or may  
require intervention to prevent any of the SAEs defined above)  
 
1The participant has spent significant time, usually involving at least an overnight stay, at the hospital or 
emergency room for treatment that would not have been appropriate in a primary care office or outpatient 
setting.  
2There is a substantial disruption of the participant’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
3Abortion, stillbirth and any malformation/disease must be reported as an SAE. 
  
Examples  of medically  important events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room for  
allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias,  convulsions that do not result in hospitali zation, 
development of drug dependency and drug abuse.  
Although not considered SAEs, cancers will be reported in the same way as SAEs .  
Planned  hospitali zations  or surgical  interventions  for a condition that existed before the  subject  
signed the ICF  and that did not change in intensity are not SAEs.  
If there is any doubt as to whether an AE meets the definition of an SAE, a  conservative 
viewpoint must be taken, and the AE must be reported as an SAE.  
 
Adverse Event s of Special Interest (AESI)  
An AE of special interest is an AE of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor ’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the Sponsor can be appropriate. Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to characterize and understand it.  The d evelopment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome or other 
continuing gastrointestinal condition will be considered an AESI.  
 Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
The term SAR is to be used whenever the Investigator assessed the SAE as possibly or probably related to the investigational product . In this study the challenge strain is considered to be an 
investigational product and the causal relationship to the ingestion of the challenge strain will be assessed.

Confidential  37 (67) Template Version:30MAR2020  
  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)  
A SUSAR is any  SAR whose nature or  intensity  is not consistent with the current version of the  
Investigator’s Brochure ( IB). 
9.5.2.1.2 Assessment of severity/intensity  
AEs regarding vital signs/ test results  listed below will be rated according to the Table 4, Table 5

events  using his/her clinical expertise and judgement based on the most appropriate description 
below :    
Mild  
 (Grade 1) The AE does not interfere in a significant manner 
with the subject’s normal functioning level. It may be an 
annoyance.  
Moderate  
 (Grade 2) The AE produces some impairment of function but 
not hazardous to health.  It is uncomfortable and/or an 
embarrassment.  
Severe  
 (Grade 3) The AE produces significant impairment of 
functioning or incapacitation and/or it is a hazard to the 
subject.  
Potentially 
Life-
threatening 
 (Grade 4) Potentially life -threatening event . 
If the severity rating for an ongoing unsolicited AE  changes before the event resolves, the 
highest severity will be recorded.  
9.5.2.1.3 Assessment of causal relationship  
The Investigator  must  assess  the causal relationship between an AE and inoculation of the 
challenge strain u sing the definitions below  and record  it on the Adverse Event Form in the 
CRF  as well  as on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form , if applicable:  
• Related – There is a reasonable possibility the test product caused the adverse event. 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the test product and the adverse event.  
• Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the test 
product caused the event.   
In addition, the causal relationship between an AE and treatment with antibiotics (not an investigational product) and/or  study procedures will be assessed.        
9.5.2.1.4 Assessment of Outcome  
The Investigator  must  assess  the outcome of an AE using the definitions below and  record  it 
on the Adverse Event Form in the CRF:  
− Recovering/resolving  indicates that the event is improving.   
− Recovered/resolved with sequelae  the  subject recuperated but retained pathological 
conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.   
− Recovered/resolved   indicates that the event has improved or recuperated.  
− Not recovered/not resolved   indicates  that the event has not improved or recuperated.  
− Fatal  the termination of life as a result of an AE.  
− Lost to Follow -up

Confidential  40 (67) Template Version:30MAR2020  
  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
AEs identified using any of the following methods will be recorded: 
− AEs spontaneously reported  by the subject  
− AEs observed by the Investigator or medical personnel 
− AEs elicited  based  on non-leading questions from the I nvestigator or medical  
personnel 
AE collection starts with the administration of the challenge strain and continues until 28 days 
after challenge (Day 29). At the phone call approximately 6 months after challenge, the AE 
collection will be limited to Adverse Events of Special Interest ( AESIs ), SAEs  and new chronic 
illnesses (see Section 9.5.6.5).  Any AE with start on Day 1 from the time of challenge, must be 
recorded with date with/or without start time. 
All A Es, serious and non-serious, should be recorded in the CRFs.   
9.5.2.1.6 Reporting of SAEs 
Starting from administration  of the challenge strain, all SAEs must be reported by the Investigator 
or designee in the Advantage eClinical System  within 24 hours of knowledge of the event, 
regardless of the time that may have elapsed from the time the event occurred to when the 
Investigator first learns of it.  
 
In the case of temporary lack of internet access or technical issue entering data into the Advantage eClinical System, a back -up system will be used for sending SAE notification via 
email to the CRO Medical Monitor/Safety Monitor using the email address Arne Parment, MD, 
PhD  Please note that emails should not contain any participant PHI/PII. Any information relayed 
via email must be entered into the Advantage eClinical system as soon as possible after the system becomes available, no later than 3 days after  the system becomes available.  
 The i nitial SAE r eport should contain as a minimum the following information: 
• Subject identification 1 
• Test product 
• Nature of the SAE  and date of onset 
• Name of the original reporter  
• Preliminary assessment of causality  
The initial report should then be followed by a detailed follow -up report as soon as possible but 
no later than three  calendar days after the initial information was received.  
Any unexpected SAEs associated with the use of the challenge strain ( SAE assessed as possibly 
or probably related to the ingestion of the challenge strain ), i.e. SUSAR, will be reported to the 
FDA and IRB according to applicable regulations (within 7 calendar days if fatal or life -
threatening and within 15 calendar days if not fatal or life-threatening).  
Further details are provided in a separate Safety Management Plan.

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
In general , AEs and expected events must be followed  up until resolution or stabilization. AE s 
will be recorded for 28 days after challenge, SAEs and A ESIs  for 6 months after challenge.  At 
the follow- up visit (Day 29) , information on new AEs /SAEs , if any, and stop dates for 
previously reported ongoing AE s must be recorded. At the follow-up contact approximately 6 
months after challenge, information on new SAEs , if any, and stop dates for previously reported 
ongoing AEs must be recorded. 
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator to follow-up on all SAEs until the subject has 
recovered, stabilized, or recovered with sequelae, and to report to SBH  all relevant new 
information using  the same  procedures  and timelines  as those for the initial  report. Relevant  
information includes discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and medical consultation. 
SAEs spontaneously reported  by a subject  to the Investigator within 30 days after  the last follow -
up assessment  should be reported to SBH  even after the clinical study has been finished, if, in 
the judgment of the Investigator, there might be an association between the event and the previous use of the test product or as a result of the investigation procedures. 
9.5.2.1.8 Procedures in case of pregnancy  
Subjects will be screened by pregnancy test before participation in this study and instructed to 
use effective contraception. Sexually active people of childbearing potential will have to use birth control (e.g. birth control pills, injection hormonal contraceptive, implant hormonal contraceptive, hormonal patch, IUD, sterilization by e.g. tubal ligation or hysterectomy, spermicidal products and barrier methods are considered acceptable) . Abstinence from sexual 
intercourse that could result in pregnancy is acceptable.   
Although not AEs, each pregnancy must be reported within 72 hours of site awareness  to the sponsor and IRB. Pr egnancies  will be  captured through Day 29. Pregnancy will be followed for 
outcome, and outcome will be reported (e.g., any premature terminations, elective or therapeutic, 
and any spontaneous abortions or stillbirths, as well as the health status of the mother and child including date of delivery and infant’s gender, length and weight). In general, pregnancies should be followed until birth or outcome is known unless the participant withdraws their study consent or is otherwise lost to follow up. 
9.5.2.1.9 Coding of AEs 
All A Es will be coded according to the current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) , and WHODrug dictionaries respectively by Arne Parment, MD, PhD 
9.5.2.2 Clinical Laboratory assessments  
Toxicology Screen  
Urine samples for a toxicology screen w ill be collected during screening.  Such samples w ill be 
tested for the presence of amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine and metabolites, 
methadone, opiates , oxycodone and phencyclidine. 
Serology 
A blood sample for serology, including HIV antibody, HbsAg, and HCV antibody (with PCR 
confirmation for active disease) w ill be collected during screening. 
Pregnancy Test  
A blood sample for a serum β -HCG pregnancy test w ill be collected during screening and on 
admission  from people of childbearing potential. Urine HCG will be done if serum results from

admission day (Day - 1) are not available by the time of Challenge and at the Day 29 outpatient 
visit.  
ABO Type and Rh Status  
An ABO type and Rh status will be collected during screening.  
Hematology  and Clinical Chemistry  
Blood samples w ill be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations during screening.  Blood 
samples  for clinical laboratory evaluations , as listed below, will also be collected at Day - 1 if 
they were not performed within the previous 7 days. 
 Hematology  (which will include) :   
Hemoglobin White blood cell (WBC) count with differential  
Hematocrit  Platelet count  
Clinical Chemistry  (which will include):  
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)  Potassium  
Creatinine  Alanine transaminase (ALT)  
Glucose   Sodium  
Carbon dioxide  Chloride             
 
Analysis of all screening blood and urine samples will be performed by Quest Diagnostics .  
 
Samples & Shipping  
The maximum volume  of blood to be drawn will not exceed 550 mL over any 8- week 
period, which healthy adults should tolerate  and which should not compromise the 
health of  participants.  
Blood and stool will be collected by trained personnel as per the Schedule of 
Procedures (Table 1) and per the M OP. They will be labelled with the participant study 
numbers, processed and stored on the inpatient unit or the clinic, and then packed and 
sent to the CIR laboratory  at an agreed upon shipment schedule.  All research 
bloodwork and stool samples, as well as the preparation of the live inoculum, will be carried out in the laboratory of the CIR in the JHSPH. Immunologic and other research assays (as per study schedule) will be carried out at the JHSPH CIR Enterics lab.  
Samples will be stored and distributed in compliance with DOT/IATA standards, 
guidance from the JHU Biosafety Review, and based on the M OP. Samples collected 
under this protocol will be used to conduct safety, microbiologic, and immunogenicity evaluations  and other research labs . 
Urine b -HCG will be performed by the CIR under a CLIA waiver.  
Additional results on blood work and the urine drug screen may be received due to the use of 
standard panels. Extraneous results will not be considered in determining a subject’s eligibility,

although the PI or designee will contact subjects about any abnormal values deemed to be 
clinically significant.  
 Biospecimen Management 
Any unused blood or stool specimens will be stored once the study is complete. Samples and data collected under this protocol may be used only for research purposes. Participant DNA 
present in samples will not be used for genetic testing, however genetic testing may be done on bacterial DNA. These samples will not be sold or used to make commercial products.  
Access to research samples will be limited using locked freezers. Samples and data will be stored 
using codes assigned by the investigators or their designee(s). Data will be kept on password- protected computers. Only investigators or their designee(s) wi ll have access to the samples and 
data.  
Any other research or experimental treatments will be conducted under other protocols for which separate IRB review and approval will be obtained. At the completion of the protocol 
(termination), samples that remain at JHSPH and data may be transferred to a repository Arne 
Parment, MD, PhD  
In the future, other investigators who may wish to study these samples and/or data. In that case, IRB approval will be sought prior to any sample sharing. Similarly, IRB approval will be obtained prior to sharing any clinical information, with or without patient identifiers that may be linked to samples being shared. The research use of stored, unlinked, or de- identified samples 
(for example, as a standard for immunological analyses) may be exempt from the need for prospective IRB review and approval. Exemption requests will be submitted in writing to the JHU IRB office, which is  authorized to determine whether a research activity is exempt.  
Any loss or unintentional destruction of samples, or data (for example, due to freezer malfunction, or missing case report forms [CRFs]) that compromises the scientific integrity of the study or poses a potential breach of confidentiality for the participant will be reported to the IRB.  
Any future research use of these biological samples will require IRB approval. Subjects will be 
asked to consent for the future use of their specimens as part of consenting to participate in this 
study. Samples  will be stored only with the participant’s permission, which is a requirement for 
participation in the study. The participant may withdraw permission for future use of specimens at any time. If a participant withdraws his or her permission for future use of specimens, those specimens will be destroye d. In this case, the PI will ensure the destruction of all known 
remaining samples and will report this to both the participant and IRB. This decision may not affect the participant’s participation in future protocols.
   
9.5.2.3 Physical examination  
A complete physical examination [head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), heart, lungs, 
abdomen, skin, lymph nodes, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems] will be performed during screening and on admission. 
  Clinical Study Protocol /  OEV- 131

Confidential  44 (67) Template Version:30MAR2020  
  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
During in- patient period, a focused physical exam will be conducted daily . Subjects will be 
examined by the investigator daily for signs and symptoms of  ETEC illness . Examinations will 
be performed more frequently if the subject is ill.  
Physical examination findings will only be collected in the eCRF when there are abnormal 
findings .  Abnormal findings assessed prior to challenge will be documented as pre- existing  
medical conditions  (Medical history form ). Abnormal findings  from the time of challenge 
onward will be documented as adverse events  or expected events .  
9.5.2.4   Vital signs  
Vitals signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), pulse (beats/minute)  and 
temperature ( °C), will be measured at least 3 times daily during in- patient period. In addition, 
postural (supine to standing) blood pressure and pulse w ill be measured if indicated by clinical 
signs and symptoms .  If tolerated, postural vital signs will be measured after the subject has been 
supine for 2 minutes, then again after 2 minutes of standing. Vital signs may  be measured more 
frequently if the subject is ill or per  the orders of the PI or designee . 
Only key vital signs (measured on Day - 1 and on Day 1 after ch allenge)  will be collected in the 
eCRF. Additional  vital signs may  be collected in the eCRF per the investigator´s clinical 
decision ; clinical findings may be reportable as AE s per provider discretion.   
The following vital sign measurements are concerning for hypovolemia and will be closely 
monitored:   
• Supine systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg.  
• Postural decrease in systolic BP of >20 mmHg. 
• Postural decrease in diastolic BP of >20 mmHg. 
• Postural increase in pulse >30 beats/min. 
9.5.3 Clinical and Microbiology assessments during in- patient  period  
9.5.3.1 Stool collection and Evaluation 
During the in -patient period, a ll stools will be collected , weighed and graded in order to 
determine the occurrence and intensity of diarrhea .   
9.5.3.1.1 Stool grading System  
Stools will be graded according to the following criteria:  
Grade 1 = firm, formed  
Grade 2 = soft but still formed  
Grade 3 = thick liquid  
Grade 4 = thin liquid  
Grade 5 = clear or translucent, watery  
 
The end of a diarrheal episode occurs when a subject does not pass any grade 3- 5 stool within 24 
hours.

Severe  ≥6 grade 3 -5 stools in 24 hours or >800 grams of 
grade 3 -5 stools  passed in a 24 -hour period   
 
Up to  3 stools and/or rectal swabs each day will be cultured . Fecal cultures w ill be performed by 
the E nterics lab at JHSPH .  Stools or swabs for culture will be  taken to the  JHSPH laboratory, 
where they  will be inoculated directly onto MacConkey agar and onto MacConkey agar that had 
incorporated streptomycin selective for the inoculum strain. Up to 10 colonies w ill be 
agglutinated using specific antisera. The level of fecal s hedding (cfu per gram of stool) will be 
assessed by q uantitative  stool cultures on Days 2 and 4 post -challenge.    
9.5.3.1.3 ETEC Disease Severity  
A three- component disease score utilizing objective signs, subjective, sym ptoms and stool output  
will be analy zed for the entirety of the clinical illness ( Table 7) . The scoring goes from 0 (no 
diarrhea and no other signs or symptoms) to the maximum of 8 (severe ETEC disease)  [31] .  
Table 7.  Disease Severity Score Components  
Parameter  Outcome  Score  
Objective signs  >1 episode of vomiting/24 h ours OR any fever  2

If an ETEC Disease -specific expected event changes in severity, it should be reported as a new 
event with the new severity but with the same event description. For definitions regarding 
severity rating and assessment of causal relationship see Section s 9.5.2.1.2, 9.5.2.1.3 and Table 
8.    
For other events including other ETEC disease -specific expected events where no pre- specified 
definition of severity is available , the Investigator will assess the severity of events  using his/her 
clinical expertise and judgement based on the most appropriate description stated in Section 
9.5.2.1.2.

2. Would you have stayed in bed (if so, how long) ?  
9.5.4 Additional assessments  
9.5.4.1 Prior and concomitant medications  
Medication s taken by the subjects within 28 days prior to study screening until the follow -up 
visit ( Day 29) will be documented in the subject´s medical record and recorded in the eCRF. 
Prescription medications, over -the-counter (OTC) medications, and herbal products should be 
asked for.  
Prior and concomitant medication will be documented at the Screening visit. Changes in 
prior/concomitant medication compared to Screening will be documented throughout the study. For detailed information on prohibited and concomitant medication to be administered during the study, refer to Section 9.4.8.       
Medication that was stopped before baseline (Day 1) will be classified as ‘prior medication’. Medications used from Day 1 will be classified as ‘concomitant medication’.   
9.5.5 Exploratory assessments  
• Immunogenicity of the challenge with enterotoxigenic E. coli  (ETEC) strain E24377A  
will be evaluated  as shown below:   
o Serum IgA  and IgG antibody response to LT, CS1 and CS3 will be assessed.  
o ALS IgA antibody response to LT, CS1 and CS3 will be assessed.  
o Fecal IgA antibody response to LT, CS1 and CS3 will be assessed.

If the participant meets the discharge criteria early and are determined to be eligible by an 
investigator, they will be considered discharged. Participants will be offered the options of 
remaining on the unit as a boarder or leaving the unit and returning on Day 7 and 8 (as 
applicable) to complete the outpatient procedures per the Schedule of Events ( Table 1 ). Boarders 
who remain on the unit will undergo the procedures required for outpatient visits. Boarders will 
continue to have their concomitant medications and antibiotics administered by staff and 
recorded on the CRF. Early discharged participants will be given stool collections kits so that 
they may bring fecal samples to outpatient visits. Fecal samples will be collected, processed and 
sent per Table 1. Stool cultures will not be sent.  
If the participant does not meet the discharge criteria but elects to withdraw early from the 
inpatient period and is amendable to returning for any or all future study visits, they will be considered “off treatment” but not terminated from study 
9.5.6.8 Early Termination Visit 
If a subject terminates the study before Day 29, every effort will be made to have the subject undergo the procedures  as described in Section 9.5.6.4 for the follow-up visit. 
In case an early termination visit as described above is not possible, a follow-up safety phone call should be made as soon as possible after termination to capture  any SAEs or AESIs  since 
the last study visit, if possible. 
The reason for premature termination  must be documented in the subject´s medical records and 
in the eCRF.        
9.5.7 Appropriateness of measurements  
Standard safety assessment methods are used in this study and are very similar to procedures 
performed in all previously conducted clinical studies in which the E2477A challenge strain was 
used.

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
The purpose of the current study is to estimate the incidence of moderate and severe diarrhea 
among participants challenged with 4x109 cfu of the E. coli E24377A strain. This dose is 
planned to be used in a subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 
vaccination and CHIM study. In order to meet this objective, all stools will be collected during 
in-patient period from immediately after E24377A administration on Day 1 through meeting 
discharge criteria  and examined, weighed, and graded by the study staff using standard criteria. 
9.6 Data quality assurance 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the CSP , relevant Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
The Principal Investigator will provide SBH  with all data produced during the study from the 
scheduled study assessments. He/she ensures the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timelines of the data reported to SBH  in the e CRF  and in all required reports. 
9.6.1 Monitoring  
The study site will be Arne Parment, MD, PhD  overseeing monitoring activities  at times agreed 
on by the Investigator. It is the function of the Monitor to ascertain that all aspects of the CSP are complied with and that the conduct of the study conforms to applicable regulatory requirements  
and established rules for GCP.  
At the time of each monitoring visit, the  Monitor will review the e CRFs to ascertain that all 
items have been completed and that the data provided are accurate and obtained in the manner specified in the C SP.  
The Monitor will also check that the data in the eCRF are consistent with the clinical records 
(Source Data Verification) and that study results are recorded completely and correctly.  
The Monitor will check on the reporting of SAEs, procedures for test product accountability and 
record keepin g. For this purpose, the Monitor must be given direct access to clinical records, 
original laboratory data, etc., as far as these relate to the study and without jeopardizing subject integrity. eCRFs for all included subjects must be made available to the Monitor for review.  
Further details are provided in a separate Monitoring Plan.  
9.6.2 Audits and inspections 
Authorized representatives of SBH  or a regulatory authority, may perform audits or inspections 
at the research clinic, including Source Data Verification (SDV).  The purpose of an audit or 
inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study- related activities and 
documents, to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analy zed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH-GCP guidelines and any 
applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator will contact SBH  immediately if contacted 
by a Regulatory Authority about an inspection at the site . 
9.6.3 eCase Report Forms  (eCRFs)  
An eCRF must be completed and signed by authorized personnel for each included subject, according to the e CRF completion instructions .

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
All data must be entered in English. The e CRFs should always reflect the latest observations 
made during the subjects ´ participation in the study. Therefore, the eCRFs should be completed 
as soon as possible during or after the subject’s visit. Data generated during the inpatient period 
will be entered in a timely fashion after discharge of the volunteers.  
The Investigator must verify that all data entries in the e CRFs are accurate and correct by signing 
the completed e CRF.  
The completed e CRFs should be made available for checking of completeness and accuracy by 
the Monitor .  
 Please see S ection 9.8 for further details.  
9.6.4 Source Data  
A separate source data document will be generated by the site before start of subject screening .  
The source document s will include all information appearing in the eCRFs.  
The Investigator should guarantee access to source documents to the Monitor  and Regulatory 
Authorities,  if required.  
9.6.5 Training of s tudy staff  
Before screening of the first subject the Monitor and/or Project Manager will perform an initiation visit at the study site . The requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related 
documents will be reviewed and discussed, and the study staff will be trained in any study 
specific procedures and system(s) utili zed. 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to ensure that all personnel involved in the study are fully informed of all relevant aspects of the study, and have a detailed knowledge of and training in the procedures that are to be executed by them , including good documentation 
practice. Any new information of relevance to the performance of this study must be forwarded 
to the staff involved in a timely manner. 
The Investigator will keep a list of all personnel involved in the study together with their 
function and study related duties delegated. A Curriculum Vitae (CV) will be available for all CIR staff delegated study -specific duties.  
9.7 Statistical methods and determination of sample size

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
9.7.1.2 Medical history and concomitant medication  
Descriptive statistics of medical history , prior/concomitant medications , and on- study antibiotic 
treatment  will be presented .  
9.7.2 Analysis of Clinical and Microbiology endpoints   
For t he primary endpoint, the proportion of subjects with moderate and  severe diarrhea ( defined 
as ≥ 4 grade 3 -5 stools or  > 400 grams of grade 3 -5 stools passed in a rolling 24- hour period) , 
deemed attributable to ETEC  by an adjudication committee, will be presented with point 
estimate and  the corresponding two -sided 95% confidence interval. For secondary clinical and 
microbiology endpoint s, descriptive statistics  will be presented, including two -sided 95% 
confidence interval s where applicable. For time to event analysis (time to onset of diarrhea  and 
time to primary endpoint ) Kaplan -Meier time to event methods will be used.   
9.7.2.1 Analysis of requirement for early antibiotic treatment  
The number and percentage of subjects requiring early antibiotic treatment , defined as treatment 
beginning prior to Day 6, will be presented.    
9.7.3 Analysis of safety  
9.7.3.1 Adverse Events  
AEs and SAEs will be recorded from a dministration of the challenge strain  until the f ollow -up 
visit on Day 29. At the follow up con tact (phone call) approximately 6 months after challenge , 
new SAEs , new chronic illnesses (capture new diagnoses e.g. diabetes, hypertension, cancer) and 
AESIs  (see Section 9.5.2.1.1) will be queried, and any open AEs and/or expected events will be 
followed up.  
AEs will be coded using the current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
and summari zed by Preferred Term (PT) and System Organ Class (SOC).  The number of 
subjects reporting AEs, and the number of AEs reported will be presented. The events will be tabulated by SOC, PT and by severity and relationship to test product . AEs leading to study 
withdrawal and SAEs will also be presented in separate tabulations.  
9.7.3.2 Vital signs and Physical examination findings  
Key vital signs  (those measured on Day - 1 and 30 minutes  after challenge)  will be  summarized.  
9.7.4 Analysis of exploratory assessment  
 
The exploratory assessments will be reported separately  from the  Clinical Study Report (CSR).

  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
9.7.5 Analysis data sets  
9.7.5.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical evaluations will be based on all subjects who have been 
challenged with E24377A  (regardless if the whole intended challenge dose was ingested or a 
subject vomited just after ingestion)  and have available data.  
9.7.5.2 Determination of sample size  
In prepar ation for a planned phase 3  vaccination and CHIM study, it is  assumed based on 
previous clinical experience, see Table 2 and Table 3 [ 18, 24]  that a pre- study in up to 30 
subjects sh ould be sufficient  to estimate the incidence of moderate and severe diarrhea among 
participants challenged with 4x109 cfu of the E. coli E24377A strain. With 25 subjects and an 
attack rate of 60%  or 70% , the 95% confidence interval for the estimated incidence would be 
(0.39, 0,79)  or (0.45, 0.87) , respectively .    
Since there is a maximum capacity of 30 subjects for the in -patient period, the number of 
subjects will not exceed 30.  
9.7.6 Statistical/analytical issues  
9.7.6.1 Adjustments for covariates  
No adjustment for covariates in statistical analyses are planned.  
9.7.6.2 Handling of dropouts or missing data

9.7.6.7 Interim analyses and data monitoring 
An adjudication of challenge outcome data will be performed after completion of the in- patient 
period. Following a partial lock of the challenge outcome data, topline results will be generated 
before the last subject´s follow -up contact.  
9.8 Outcome Adjudication Committee  
An outcome adjudication committee will be used to judge if the diarrhea is attributable to ETEC and determine if  a subject me ets the primary endpoint  by considering indi vidual data as described 
in the adjudication charter.  
The committee will be comprised of at least 3 individuals, who are experts on diarrheal illness 
case identification and pathogen diagnosis. The committee will also include a statistician/data analyst who will participate in the adjudication meeting  but will not have a voting role in 
deliberations.  
Specific duties and responsibilities will be outlined by charter prior to the start of the in -patient 
period of the study. 
9.9 Data Management 
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities defined to achieve safe routines to 
efficiently enter subject information into a database, avoiding errors. 
The data management activities, such as procedures of validating data entered in the eCRF, will 
be described in a separate data management plan. The eCRF will be designed in accordance with the Clinical Study Protocol.  
9.9.1 The web based e CRF  
Clinical data (including AEs and concomitant medications) will be entered into a 21 CFR Part 
11-compliant eCRF ( Advantage eClinical  Cloud) provided by Arne Parment, MD, PhD  The data 
system  includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range 
checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be 
entered directly from the source documents, which are to be defined at the site before inclusion of the first subject.
 
Authorized study site personnel designated by the Investigator will complete data collection. Appropriate training will be completed with the Investigator and all authorized study site personnel prior to any data being entered into the system for any study subject. Each user will have a personal and unique account. e CRF data entries will be attributable to the unique user.  
Captured data will be monitored electronically. Source data verification (SDV) and source data review will be performed at the site as described in the monitoring guidelines.

Confidential  57 (67) Template Version:30MAR2020  
  (App 1 SOP EtC1011)  
9.9.2 Entering of data into the eCRF  
The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations made during the subjects ´ participation 
in the study. The eCRFs should be completed as soon as possible during or after the subject’s 
visit.  
If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not available, not applicable or unknown, this will be indicated in the eCRF.  
Entries triggering internal eCRF checks will be presented as errors and warnings. Forms with incomplete entries or that contains triggered errors cannot be set to completed state.  
The Investigator must verify that all data entries in the e CRFs are accurate and correct by signing 
the completed e CRF.  
Once all data have been entered, verified, and validated, the database will be locked.  
After the eCRF has been locked, the data will be sent to the Sponsor and a copy to the research clinic to be filed in the Investigator Study File (ISF) for archiving. 
9.9.3 The query process  
The Monitor will review the eCRFs and source documents to evaluate them for completeness 
and consistency. The eCRF will be compared with the respective source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies in  critical data (SDV), in accordance with the monitoring 
guidelines.
 
Data Manager will perform data validation checks on data in  the eCRF, as defined in the Data 
Management Plan (DMP).  
Automated and/or Manual queries will be raised in the eCRF by Safety team , Study Monitor 
and/or by Data Manager respectively if inconsistencies or suspected errors are found. Queries 
shall be resolved, and data updated if applicable, in a timely manner by authori zed study site 
personnel. The Monitor or Data Manager cannot enter or update data in the eCRF. 
9.9.4 Source documents  
Data entered into the subjects’ medical record at the clinic and original analysis results at the 
laboratory  will be considered source data. The eCRF is considered as source data when data is 
entered directly into the eCRF. A Data Management Plan (DMP) will be written, detailing the collection of data into the study database.  
Source documents are all documents used by the Investigator or hospital that relate to the subject’s medical history, that verifies the existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and all records covering the subject’s participation in the study. Source documents include laboratory results, memoranda, material dispensing records, subject files, etc .  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. These will be made available for inspection by the Monitor at each monitoring visit. Any  supportive documentation submitted 
with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital records, should be clearly identified with the study ID and Subject Number. Any personal information, including name, should be removed or

within 12 months after completion of the study.  
Results for the exploratory endpoints will be reported separately from the Clinical Study Report. If the study duration exceeds one year, SBH  must submit an annual safety report to the FDA and 
to the  IRB (if applicable) . The report will summarize all SAEs and contain an update of the risk-
benefit evaluation if there has been any change since the approval of the clinical study. Formal presentation or publication of data collected in this study should be considered as a joint 
publication by the Principal Investigator, other Investigator s and a person appointed by SBH . 
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement.  
Before any publication (oral or written) of the results SBH  will be given 30 days for review and 
comment on the manuscript. If the Principal Investigator and/or other Investigator s have not 
submitted the results for publication within six months after completion of the final Clinical 
Study Report, the SBH  has the right to publish. In this event, the Principal Investigator and/or 
other  Investigator s will be given 30 days to review and comment on the manuscript before it is 
submitted to a journal. 
11.5 Disclosure and confidentiality  
All unpublished information concerning the test product and research carried out by the SBH , 
including patent applications, manufacturing processes, scientific data  from analysis of the 
primary and secondary endpoints etc., is considered confidential and the sole property of SBH .

1.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  SUMMARY  
1.1 Study  Purpose  
The purpose of this randomized pivotal study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EPi - 
Sense®-AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax® to treat symptomatic persistent Atrial 
Fibrillation (AF) patients who are refractory or intolerant to at leas t one Class I and/or III AAD. 
For the purposes of this study:  
 
Refractory to Class I and/or III AAD will be defined as drug used that did not result in the 
absence of AF or atrial flutter (AFL);  
 
Intolerant to Class I and/or III AAD will be defined as drug that patient was unable to tolerate 
and/or the side effects listed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use were observed in the 
patient during the AAD drug therapy.  
 
Persistent  AF will be defined  according  to the Heart  Rhythm  Society  (HRS)  “HRS  2012 Expert 
Consensus Statement on Catheter and Surgical Ablation of  AF”. 
 
• Persistent AF is defined as continuous AF that is sustained beyond 7 days. Episodes 
of AF in which a decision is made to electrically or pharmacologically cardiovert the 
patient  after >48 hours  of AF, but prior to 7 days,  should  also be classified  as persistent 
AF episodes.  
Persistent AF to be documented by:  
o Physician notes in patient’s medical history  AND  
o Two ECGs  (from  any forms  of rhythm  monitoring)  showing  continuous  AF with 
ECGs taken at least 7 days apart, within last 12 months.  OR 
o History of failed DC cardioversion (electrical or  pharmacologic)  
It is anticipated  that the data from this randomized  pivotal  clinical  study  will be used  to support 
a premarket approval application (PMA) to obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval to market the EPi -Sense®-AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax® for the 
treatment of symptomatic persistent AF in patients who are refractory or intol erant to at least 
one Class I and/or III  AAD.  
1.2 Name and Intended Use of  Device  
Common  Name:  Surgical Device for Ablation of Cardiac  Tissue  
Trade  Name:  EPi-Sense®-AF Guided Coagulation System with  VisiTrax® 
Intended  Use: The EPi -Sense -AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax is 
intended for the treatment of symptomatic persistent Atrial Fibrillation 
that is refractory or intolerant to at least one Class I and/or III anti - 
arrhythmic drug (AAD) when used with an open irrigated R F ablation 
catheter to complete PV isolation by ablating breakthroughs between 
the epicardial  lesions.  
 
1.3 Study  Design  
This is a, prospective, open label 2:1 randomized (convergent procedure versus standalone 
endocardial catheter ablation) multi -center pivot al clinical study. The study will enroll and 
randomize one hundred and fifty three (153) patients from up to thirty (30) sites, twenty -seven  
(27) US and three (3) OUS.  
 
Potential subjects with symptomatic persistent AF will be screened by the sites for study 
participation. Consented subjects meeting all inclusion / exclusion criteria will be enrolled and 
randomized into the study.  
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 55  
  
Subjects in both arms of the study will be evaluated post procedure at 1 month, 3 months, 6 
months and 12 mont hs with a long -term follow -up visit at 18 months and long -term phone 
follow -up at 2, 3, 4, 5 years  as detailed  in this protocol.  Submission  for premarket  approval  will 
be filed after study subjects in both arms of the study complete the one year post procedure 
follow -up visit. 
 
Annual reports will be submitted to the Agency in compliance with FDA regulatory 
requirements. One month safety data for the first 50 subjec ts in the treatment arm will be 
submitted to the FDA for review. During the conduct of this randomized study, any reported 
death, pericardial effusion leading to therapeutic drainage, atrio -aesophageal fistula or stroke 
will be reported to the Agency withi n 10 days.  
 
1.4 Study  Objectives  
The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EPi -Sense -AF 
Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax for the treatment of symptomatic persistent AF as 
compared to a standalone endocardial cath eter ablation.  
1.4.1  Primary  Objectives  
To demonstrate superiority of the convergent procedure (experimental) compared to the 
standalone  endocardial  catheter  ablation  (control)  on overall  success,  defined  as freedom  from 
AF/AFL/AT absent class I and III AADs exc ept for a previously failed class I or III AAD with no 
increase in dosage following the 3 month blanking period through the 12 months post 
procedure follow -up visit. 
The incidence rate of Major Adverse Events (MAEs) in the treatment arm will demonstrate an  
acceptable risk profile.  
1.4.2  Secondary  Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of the procedure as a 90% reduction in the subject’s baseline AF 
burden at 12 months post procedure in the presence or absence of class I / III AADs and a 
change in QOL measures and the six minute walk test scores from the basel ine to 12 months 
post procedure.  
1.4.3  Exploratory  Objectives  
To demonstrate the efficacy of the procedure as a 90% reduction in the subject’s baseline AF 
burden at 18 months post -procedure in presence or absence of Class I/III  AAD’s.  
 
To explore  the impact  of the convergent  procedure  on left atrial  size and left ventricular  ejection 
fraction. In addition  we may evaluate the number of hospitalizations, total number of days 
hospitalized, and number of rhythm disturbance treatments for a period of 12 months before 
and after the convergent procedure for a health economics data  analysis.  
 
1.5 Study  Endpoints  
 
1.5.1  Prim ary Efficacy  Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is success or failure to be AF/AT/AFL free absent class I and III 
AADs except for a previously failed or intolerant class I or III AAD with no increase in dosage 
following the 3 month blanking period thr ough the 12 months post procedure follow -up visit.  
 
The results  of the holter  data used  for the primary  efficacy  endpoint  evaluation  will be evaluated 
by an independent reviewer thus maintaining the objectivity of the primary efficacy  endpoint.  
 
Subjects will be considered primary efficacy failures if any of the following conditions are 
observed:

1.5.3  Primary Safety  Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint for the study will be defined as the incidence of major adverse 
events (MAEs) listed below for subjects undergoing the convergent procedure for the 
procedural to 30 day post procedure time period.  
 
All MAEs will be adjudicated b y the Clinical Events Committee (CEC), thus maintaining the 
objectivity of the primary safety endpoint.  
 
• Cardiac tamponade/perforation: is defined as the development of a significant 
pericardial effusion during or within 30 days of undergoing an AF ablatio n procedure. 
A significant pericardial effusion is one which results in hemodynamic compromise, 
requires  elective  or urgent  pericardiocentesis,  and results  in a 1 cm or more  pericardial 
effusion as documented by echocardiography. Cardiac tamponade/perforat ion should 
also be classified as “early” or “late” depending on whether it is diagnosed during or 
following initial discharge from the  hospital.  
Documentation of CT Scan/MRI/ECHO findings and subsequent treatment such as 
thoracentesis or pericardiocentesis.

can be categorized  as mild (<50%),  moderate  (50–70%),  and severe  (≥70%)  reduction 
in the diameter of the PV or PV branch. Severe PV stenosis should be considered a 
major complication of AF  ablation.  
Documentation by CT or MRI scan of ≥70% vessel narrowing compared to the 
baseline.  
• Excessive Bleeding: is defined as a major complication if it is subsequent to a device 
related or study procedure -related inj ury and is treated with transfusion or results in a 
20% or greater  fall in HCT.  Transfusion  for anemia  or other  pre-existing  conditions

Duration of a focal or global neurological deficit ≥24 h; OR <24 h if therapeutic 
intervention(s) were performed (e.g., thrombolytic therapy or intracranial angioplasty); 
OR available neuroimaging documents a new hemorrhage or infarct; OR the 
neurological  deficit  results  in death AND  no other  readily  identifiable  non-stroke  cause 
for the clinical presentation (e.g., brain tumor, trauma, infection, hypoglycemia, 
peripheral lesion, pharmacological  influences).  
Diagnosis should be confirmed by a neurology or neurosurgical specialist  utilizing a 
neuroimaging  procedure  (MR or CT scan  or cerebral  angiography)  or lumbar  puncture 
(i.e., spinal fluid analysis diagnostic of intracranial  hemorrhage).  
Documentation of a stroke or CVA consisting of acute loss of neurological function 
caused by an ischemic event with residual symptoms at least 24 hours after onset 
confirmed by CT or MRI scan or cerebral angiography of acute neurological event.  
• Transient  Ischemic  attacks  (TIA):  A transient  ischemic  attack  is a "mini -stroke"  caused 
by Tem porary disturbance of blood supply to an area of the brain, which results in a 
sudden, brief decrease in brain function. Clinical symptoms similar to stroke but last 
for less than 24  hours.  
Documentation of TIA neuroimaging without tissue injury consistent with acute loss of 
neurological function caused by an ischemic event with resolution of symptoms within 
24 hours after onset.

2.0 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
2.1 EPi-Sense®-AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax® Overview  
The fourth generation coagulation device, EPi -Sense Guided Coagulation System with 
VisiTrax®, has been cleared for the endoscopic coagulation of cardiac tissue (510k K120857, 
K142084).  The subject  device  for this study  will be labeled  EPi-Sense®-AF Guided  Coagulation 
System with VisiTrax® For Investigational Use  Only. 
 
The device consists of a flexible radiofrequency coil electrode assembly that can be applied 
consistently to the epicardial surface of cardiac tissue by vacuum (designed to eliminate gaps 
along  the lesion),  a perfusion  component  designed  to keep  the tissue  surface  hydrated  and the 
device surfaces not contacti ng cardiac tissue cool throughout the coagulation process, and 
sensing electrodes between select coil electrode windings to transmit cardiac electrograms to 
an external EP Recording System and transmit pacing pulses from an external stimulator; the 
complet e Coagulation System also includes a customized RF generator that transmits energy 
to the device,  and accessory  cables  to connect  the coagulation  device  to the RF generator  and 
route sensing electrode signals to an external EP Recording System. The Cannula Accessory 
is also provided to facilitate access for operative and diagnostic instrumentation including the 
EPi-Sense -AF Guided Coagulation device with VisiTrax, and enable endoscopic visualization 
throughout the lesion creation  procedure.  
 
The EPi -Sense -AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax has been designed to provide 
the following benefits:  
• Consistent contact with epicardial cardiac tissue regardless of cardiac  anatom y 
• Precise lesion creation without damage to surrounding  tissue  
• Continuous and complete  lesions  
• Visible lesions to interconnect into a  pattern  
• Device maneuverability to perform the coagulation of cardiac tissue under direct 
endoscopic visualization without chest incisions or lung  deflation  
• Use of temporary cardiac signal sensing to confirm device  location.  
 
The EPi -Sense -AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax is able to coagulate cardiac 
tissue from the epicardial surface. The ability to coagulate tissue  epicardially allows the 
procedure to be performed on a beating heart. The ability to access the posterior epicardium 
allows  the procedure  to be performed  endoscopically  without  chest  incisions,  lung deflation,  or 
dissections of the pericardial reflections (attachments between the pericardium and  atrium).  
 
The Operator’s Manual for the RF Generator and the Instructions for Use for the EPi -Sense - 
AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax  and the Cannula Accessory must be reviewed 
prior to system use.

3.0 BACKGROUND  
3.1 Atrial  Fibrillation  
AF is characterized by very fast, irregular beating of the heart's upper chambers (the atria). It 
occurs when normal sinus rhythm is disrupted by  errant irregular electrical signals in the atria. 
These erratic electrical propagation patterns disrupt the regular pumping action of the atria, 
preventing complete filling of the ventricles, and causing irregular beating of the ventricles. 
These spasms o ften lead to regions of static blood flow in the atria and consequently, blood 
clot formation, stroke and even death. It is estimated that AF is responsible for 15% - 25% of 
all strokes. Symptoms of AF typically include a rapid and irregular heartbeat, pal pitations, 
dyspnea, discomfort, dizziness and fatigue.  
 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart arrhythmia that carries a significant mortality and 
morbidity risk, and is associated with three primary clinical sequelae: loss of atrial transport, 
loss of  regular cardiac chamber synchronization, rhythm & rate response, and 
thromboembolism. Up to a third of all patients with persistent AF will experience at least one 
embolic episode during the course of their atrial fibrillation. Lone AF (e.g. no structural  heart 
disease) with no left atrial enlargement may be categorized as a benign disease since it is not 
associated with an increase in mortality or complications than that of the general population. 
However, AF patients, especially those with enlarged atria  or structural heart disease, are at 
an increased risk of congestive heart failure, thromboembolic events, and mortality.i In fact, 
permanent AF (longstanding persistent AF after the decision not to treat) is associated with 
8.2% annual all -cause mortality, 5.1% annual thormboembolic event rate, 2.7% annual major 
bleeding rate, and 16.6% annual heart failure rate.ii 
 
The underlying  theory  surrounding  the source  of irregular  conduction  pathways  in patients  with 
atrial fibrillation involves ectopic electrical activity or micro -reentrant circuits that can originate 
from specific locations in the heart such as the pulmonary vein orifice in patients with lone AF 
(focal), or more commonly ass ociated with the reentry of conduction circuits throughout the 
atria in patients with structural remodeling (wavelet  AF). 
 
Only 12% of patients have Lone AF, leaving the remaining 88% with some form of structural 
heart  disease.iii This structural  heart  disease  commonly  includes  hypertension,  coronary  artery 
and valvular heart disease. Left untreated, AF can lead to ventricular dysfunction, atrial 
dysfunction,  left atrial  enlargement  thus perpetuating  the structural  remodeling  that causes  and 
worsens atrial fibrillation and heart  failure.iv 
 
The relationship between progressive structural remodeling and atrial fibrillation explains why 
88% of AF patients are persistent or permanent leaving only 12% as paroxysmal.v 
Furthermore, 76% of AF patients either have enlarged atria with diameter greater than 4.5 cm 
or an increase in left ventricular thickness.vi Atrial enlargement, as well as st ructural 
remodeling, determines the incidence of atrial fibrillation and whether AF patients observe 
complications throughout their lifetime.

Patients newly diagnosed with AF are medically managed with multiple courses of 
antiarrhythmic  drugs  (AAD),  and anticoagulants  to lessen  the risk of thromboembolic  accidents. 
Within 5 years, most patients will become refractory to AADs, and will require additional 
intervention.  Often  AADs  will have  the effect  of “dumbing  down”  the heart’s  natural  pacemaker, 
necessitating the need for permanent rate con trol. Although the risk of thromboembolism is 
reduced in the presence of anticoagulation, it is still substantially higher than that observed in 
the general population. In addition, bleeding complications from anticoagulation regimens 
occur at a cumulative  rate of 1% per  year.  
 
3.2 Atrial Fibrillation  Classification  
The HRS/EHRA/ECAS (2012) Guidelines have classified AF into 3 groups.vii 
 
• Paroxysmal  AF is defined  as recurrent  AF (>2 episodes)  that terminates  spontaneously 
within seven  days.  
• Persistent AF is defined as AF which is sustained beyond 7 days. Episodes of AF 
which are terminated by electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion after > 48 hours of 
AF, but prior to 7 days, should also be classified as per sistent AF  episodes.  
• Longstanding persistent AF is defined as continuous AF greater than one -year 
duration.  
The term permanent  AF is not appropriate  in the context  of patients  undergoing  ablation  of AF 
as it refers  to a group  of patients where  a decision  has been  made  not to pursue  restoration  of 
sinus rhythm by any means, including catheter or surgical  ablation.  
3.3 Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation  
As described in 3.1, AF is typically first treated with drug therapy, with an approximately equal 
split between  rate and rhythm  control  drugs  as first line of treatment.  Recent  large  scale  studies 
have failed to show superiority of one treatment approach - rate or rhythm control - over 
another. Regardless of rate or rhythm control, continuous anticoagulatio n therapy is crucial in 
AF patients for stroke prevention. The AFFIRM study concluded that the benefit of restoring 
sinus rhythm in the rhythm control group was reversed by the toxicity of the antiarrhythmic 
drugs and hypothesized that if a treatment was a vailable to restore sinus rhythm without the 
toxicity of antiarrhythmic drugs, survival may be improved.  
 
Drug therapy failure may be due to either a lack of medication efficacy and/or a patient’s 
inability to tolerate medications known to have serious and bothersome side effects, including 
those  resulting  from interactions  with other  drugs.  According  to its package  insert,  Cardarone® 
(amiodarone), the most widely -prescribed anti -arrhythmic medication (not approved for the 
treatment of AF), is di scontinued in 7 -18% of patients due to intolerable side  effects.  
 
Surgical treatment of AF is usually considered when a patient is already scheduled for a 
concomitant cardiac procedure requiring access to the thoracic cavity. When performed 
concomitantly, the surgical treatment of AF is often performed using cardiopulmon ary bypass 
on an open and arrested heart. The surgeon is unable to observe atrial function and cannot 
confirm  treatment  success  intraoperatively  because  the atria must  be beating  in order  to place 
a pacing electrode and confirm conduction  block.  
 
The Maze procedures (and its derivatives, Maze III, etc.), are considered the comparative 
standard for the effective treatment of AF. The Maze III procedure requires stopping the heart 
and then surgically cutting and re -sewing the atria to create a complex pattern of lesions 
throughout the atria that are intended to block macro -reentry circuits within the atria. In the 
intervening years, the Maze III procedure has been modified, but it remains the standard for

fibrillation: recommendations for patient selection, procedural techniques, patient management, and

treatment of atrial fibrillation. However, associated procedural mortality (2 to 10%) and 
morbidity including permanent pacemaker requirements (~15% of patients) have hindered the 
adoption of “cu t and sew” procedure.  
 
There  have  been  many  attempts  to move  away  from the complexity  and risk of the cut and sew 
Maze III procedure. Most of the effort has focused on procedures to isolate errant conduction 
signals that are suspected to originate from the  pulmonary veins either by segmental ostial 
ablation  or by the creation  of a box lesion  around  the pulmonary  veins.  Electrically  isolating  the 
pulmonary veins may be effective for focal AF patients who have paroxysmal AF with no 
structural heart disease. However, more complex types of AF require a more comprehensive 
lesion  pattern  to block  all reentrant  circuits,  and therefore  sole isolation  of the pulmonary  veins 
is not an effective treatment.  
 
To date, a percutaneous catheter -based or minimally invasive surgical procedure that can 
effectively and safely treat persistent or longstanding persistent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is 
unavailable.  
 
The ideal  treatment  for AF would  mitigate  the detrimental  sequelae  of AF; that is, the procedure 
would  restore  normal  sinus  rhythm  and cardiac  hemodynamics,  prevent  continued  remodeling 
and enlargement of the atria, and reduce the risk of thromboembolism. The ideal procedure 
would provide a means for assessing completeness of the lesion patterns. Continuous  and 
complete  lesions  created  throughout  the atria and electrically  silencing  the posterior  left atrium 
as well as isolating the pulmonary veins are most likely to prevent propagation of electrical 
signals  capable  of inducing  and/or  maintaining  AF, and prevent development  of new reentrant 
circuits or atrial enlargement. The ideal procedure would also be performed utilizing minimally 
invasive, closed chest  techniques.  
 
AtriCure has developed a cardiac tissue coagulation system that may provide improved 
performance over current treatment options. Atricure’s technology is based on a low profile, 
flexible  radiofrequency  (RF) coagulation  device  that provides  consistent  conta ct with the tissue 
through  the use of vacuum.  The technology  ensures  reliable  contact,  conformation  to any tissue 
region of the heart, as well as localized -directional treatment to make conventional cardiac 
tissue coagulation more predictable. The system a lso incorporates a perfusion lumen coupled 
to the vacuum  source  that 1) hydrates  tissue  that is in contact  with the device  electrode,  and 
2) cools  the non-tissue  contacting  surfaces  of the device.  The vacuum  perfused  device  design 
controls  energy  delivery,  minimizes  the risk of over-heating  tissue  that is being  coagulated  and 
thus, the risk of charring and tissue vaporization, and also prevents damage to non -targeted, 
adjacent tissues and anatomical  structures.  
 
The inclusion of sensing electrodes to the coagulation device has provided additional input to 
the operator as to the type of tissue targeted for ablation and evaluation of the extent of 
ablation.  Electrograms,  recorded  from tissue  against  which  the coagulation  electrode  contacts,  
augment the direct endoscopic visualization of electrode position by determining definitively 
that the sensing electrodes, thus the coagulation electrode, contact target atrial tissue. The 
sensing electrodes provide input throughout energy delivery on the  extent and completeness 
of cardiac coagulation by delineating electrically viable tissue from non -viable tissue which 
coincides with a substantial reduction in cardiac electrogram amplitude. In addition, the 
sensing electrodes allow transmission of pacing  stimuli to tissue for evaluating the isolation of 
the posterior left atrium and pulmonary vein isolation at locations accessible from a 
transdiaphragmatic or sub -xyphoid pericardial window.  
 
AtriCure has taken the coagulation of cardiac tissue one step fu rther with the Guided 
Coagulation System that allows the procedure to be performed without the need for chest 
incisions.  The use of a cannula  facilitates  access  and provides  visibility  to the posterior  surface 
of the heart allowing the creation of lesions on the epicardium of the atria under direct 
visualization.  
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 13 of 55  
  
The one limitation, which ends up being a substantial benefit, of the closed chest, 
transdiaphragmatic or sub -xyphoid access is the inability to dissect the pericardial reflections 
(attachments between the atria and pericardium). This reduces the perforati on risks since 
those dissections are adjacent to thin, fragile tissue but hinders the ability to create lesions 
completely around the pulmonary veins. The reflections are short, and are located above the 
right and left superior  pulmonary  veins  and below  the right inferior  pulmonary  vein.  To address 
this limitation,  AtriCure  has proposed  treatment  for persistent  AF that incorporates  endocardial 
catheter ablation to complete pulmonary vein isolation by ablating known breakthrough 
locations in the epicardial l inear lesions at the pericardial reflections, and ablate the 
cavotricuspid isthmus to prevent typical AFL. This multidisciplinary approach combines 
epicardial and endocardial ablation procedures into a truly minimally invasive approach that 
does  not requir e chest  incisions  or lung deflation.  AtriCure  is proposing  this randomized  pivotal 
study  to evaluate  the safety  and efficacy  of the EPi-Sense -AF Guided  Coagulation  System  with 
VisiTrax  for the treatment of symptomatic persistent AF. The premise of this Convergent 
Procedure stems from the complementary nature of both  approaches.

The study eligibility and baseline assessments data will be entered into the electronic data  
capture system developed for the study.  
4.6 Subject  Randomization  
Subjects who have consented to study participation, have met all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
and have completed all baseline evaluation and are eligible for study participation will be 
randomized to either the convergent procedure or standalone endocardial catheter ablation 
procedure.  
Randomization will be implemented using Tempo™, the electronic research tool used for 
collecting  clinical  data.  Randomization  will be blocked  by investigator  site on randomly  chosen 
blocks of 3 or 6 patients allocated 2:1 to the treatment arms, respectively. Appropriate 
randomization codes will be provided on the screen immediately after randomization for a 
subject is requested. The treatment arm code will be a utomatically stored in the study 
database.  
Subjects  becoming  ineligible  for the convergent  or the endocardial  catheter  ablation  procedure 
as a result of meeting the study intra -op exclusion criteria will be  replaced.  
 
 
5.0 STUDY PROCEDURE  
Subject preparation for the convergent procedure or the standalone endocardial catheter 
ablation procedure will follow the Investigator’s and study site’s standard of practice pre - 
operative and pre -catheterization patient care instructions.  
 
5.1 Procedure Intra -Op Ex clusions  
Prior to initiating the study convergent procedure or the standalone endocardial catheter 
ablation  procedure,  review  subject  anatomy  and TEE or ICE results  to confirm  that the subject 
does not meet any of the study intra -op exclusions listed  below:  
 
• Presence of left atrial thrombi per immediate pre -op Trans -Esophageal 
Echocardiograph (TEE) for the convergent procedure, and per TEE or Intra cardiac 
Echo (ICE) for the standalone endocardial catheter ablation  procedure.  
• Presence of adhesions that  would prevent epicardial access to the pericardial space 
or the creation of the study recommended complete lesion pattern. (Convergent 
procedure arm  only)  
 
If the subject meets any of the above intra -op exclusions, the study procedures will not be 
perform ed. Subjects  meeting  the intra-op exclusions  will be followed  for 30 days  post procedure 
and will be included in the study safety analysis only. Alternative treatment procedures for the 
subject’s AF should be scheduled after the subject’s 30 day follow -up for safety and study 
participation is completed.  
5.2 Study Procedure – Convergent P rocedure  Arm 
Once the procedure intra -op exclusion conditions have been evaluated, the epicardial lesion 
pattern  will be created  using  the EPi-Sense -AF Guided  Coagulation  System  with VisiTrax.  The 
recommended  study  procedure  outlined  in Attachment  A, and the Investigator’s  Training  Guide 
should be followed to create the epicardial / endocardial lesion  pattern.  
 
Epicardial linear lesions will be created endoscopically using the EPi -Sense -AF Guided 
Coagulation  System  with VisiTrax  throughout  the posterior  left atrium  and along  the pericardial 
reflections  from a  trans -diaphragmatic  or sub-xyphoid  access  without  any chest  incisions.  The 
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 55  
  
pericardial reflections will not be dissected. An endocardial ablation catheter will be used to 
ablate endocardially to connect lesions at the reflections to complete the isolation of the 
pulmonary veins, and create a cavotricuspid lesion to prevent typica l atrial flutter. For patients 
with inducible atrial arrhythmias (atypical atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, AVNRT, etc.) the 
arrhythmia may be mapped and ablated. If the subject does not organize into AT or SR, then 
the patient should be cardioverted th rough the administration of Ibutilide or electrical 
cardioversion.  Posterior  and other  linear  lesions  such  as a roof lesion  and mitral  valve  isthmus 
lesion will not be created during the endocardial component of the convergent  procedure.  
 
Once the study lesion pattern has been created by coagulating cardiac tissue using the EPi - 
Sense -AF Guided Coagulation System and the endocardial ablation catheter, the pulmonary 
veins  must  be evaluated  for entrance  and/or  exit block  to confirm  isolation.  Follow  the protocol 
provided in Attachment C to confirm pulmonary vein  isolation.  
 
The following procedure and post procedure data will be entered into the electronic data 
capture system developed for the study.

5.3 Study Procedure – Standalone Endocardial Catheter Ablation  Arm 
The Endocardial lesion pattern will be created using one of the irrigated endocardial catheter 
listed in Attachment B. To create the endocardial lesion pattern, follow the suggested lesion 
creation steps described in Attachment B. Access the anatomical loc ations endocardially, and 
create  the lesion  pattern  which  includes  isolating  the left and right pulmonary  veins,  connecting 
the PV isolation lesions with an atrial roof lesion, and ensuring bidirectional block across a 
cavotricuspid isthmus lesion. The ele ctrophysiologist can spend up to 30 min in the control 
arm doing  CFAE  ablation  (must  not be making  linear  lesions)  if, after PVI and the roof lesions, 
the patient’s rhythm does not organize into an atrial flutter (AFL) or atrial tachycardia (AT) or 
convert  to sinus rhythm; CFAE is defined as constant electrical activity or local activity with an 
atrial electrogram cycle length <120 msec.viii,ix For patients that convert to an AT or AFL or 
develop inducible atrial arrhythmias (AFL, AT, AVNRT, etc.) the arrhythmia may be mapped 
and ablated. If the subject does not organize into AFL, AT, or SR then the patient should be 
cardioverted through the admi nistration of Ibutilide or electrical cardioversion. The completion 
of each lesion may require multiple sequential placements. If additional lesion(s) are created 
or suggested lesions are not created, this must be entered into the electronic data capture 
system developed for the  study.  
 
Once the study lesion pattern has been created using the endocardial ablation catheter, the 
pulmonary veins must be evaluated for entrance and/or exit block to confirm isolation. Follow 
the pacing protocol provided in Attach ment C to confirm pulmonary vein isolation.  
 
The following procedure and post procedure data will be entered into the electronic data 
capture system developed for the study.

and e ndocardial ablation system should be reviewed for additional directions for use and 
troubleshooting  tips. 
 
5.4 Acute Procedural  Success  
Acute procedural success will be assessed as the completion of the study defined lesion 
pattern and pulmonary vein isolation as demonstrated by entrance and /or exit block.  
 
6.0 POST PROCEDURE FOLLOW -UP ASSESSMENTS  
All study subjects in both arms of the study will be followed at 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 
months, and 12 months with a long -term follow -up visit at 18 month s and long -term phone 
follow -up at 2, 3, 4, 5 years post index procedure as detailed in this protocol. The follow -up 
assessment data will be entered into the electronic data capture system developed for the 
study.  
 
Subjects should be weaned off any Class I  and III AADs at the 3 month post procedure visit 
unless medically indicated (alternatively, subjects may continue previously failed class I or III 
AAD at the previous dose or lower). All cardiac medications will be prescribed as medically 
indicated or per  physician standard of practice.  
 
All Holter monitor recordings will be reviewed by an independent reviewer designated by the 
Sponsor:  AtriCure.  
 
6.1 Blanking  Period  
The period from index procedure to the 3 month  post procedure visit will be considered a 
blanking period. During the blanking period, the use of AADs, cardioversions, and any 
recurrence or episodes of AF will not be considered a treatment failure. Subjects who receive 
AF therapy (a new class I/III AAD , or an increase in dose of a previously failed class I/III AAD 
therapy, DCCV, pharmacological cardioversion, RFCA) following the 3 month blanking period 
through the 12 months post procedure follow -up visit will be considered primary efficacy 
failures. Sub jects receiving RFCA for the treatment of AF, left -sided atypical atrial flutter, or 
atrial  tachycardia  at anytime  (even  within  the blanking  period)  after the index  procedure  will be 
deemed primary efficacy failures; any RFCA should be performed in accorda nce with 
Attachment  F – Repeat  Catheter  Ablation  Protocol.  Subjects  in either  arm of the study  who are 
efficacy failures (documented by the 24 hour holter results), at the six month post procedure 
follow -up time point, may undergo an ablation procedure per  physician recommendation. 
Subjects  will be deemed  efficacy  failures,  the ablation  will be recorded  as a rhythm  disturbance 
treatment within the TEMPO EDC system, and the subjects will be continued to be monitored 
per protocol  requirements.  
 
6.2 7 Day post procedure Visit (7 days +7 days post index  procedure)  
After completion of the study procedure subjects in both study arms will return for a post 
procedure  follow -up visit at 7 days  for an evaluation  of any peri-procedural  adverse  symptoms. 
The 7 days post procedure evaluation will  include:  
• Evaluation of any adverse events

6.8 Data Collection and  Management  
AtriCure or their designated CRO will be responsible for the design of the eCRF, monitoring 
the trial according to GCP guidelines, preparation of data queries and reports to assist the 
clinical monitoring, and training each study site staff member entering data in the eCRF. 
AtriCure  or their designated  CRO  will also be responsible  for preparation  of analysis  files from 
the database  prior to analyses,  assisting  with the statistical  analyses  and statistical  report,  and 
preparation of the integrated clinical study  report.  
 
The electronic data capture (eDC) component of Tempo™ will be used for electronic data 
acquisition  and storage.  Tempo™  will provide  electronic  case  report  forms  (eCRFs)  for transfer 
of all research data by site personnel from data source documentation to the study database. 
Each responsible person at a site will have user  access to Tempo™ through their unique 
username and password, with permissions providing each person their needed  access. Some 
personnel will have data entry, data review, and query resolution permissions, while others 
may only have  data read permissions,  based  on their individual  study  roles.  Tempo™  is flexible 
to allow customizable permissions as needed for study  personnel.  
 
Study data will be checked for completeness and correctness as it is entered by the real -time 
online checks applied by Tempo™. Off -line checks will also be run to perform any additional  
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 55  
  
data review required. Any issues identified will be transferred to the study site via query for 
resolution by the investigator or his/her designee. All queries will be manage d through 
Tempo™ and audit trails of all queries and their resolution, along with any data changes, will 
be recorded.  
 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source 
data/documents, and reports for the purpose of mon itoring and auditing by the sponsor, and 
inspection by local and regulatory authorities.  
 
Clinical research associates (CRAs) will monitor the data, verifying captured data against its 
source. Monitoring will be enhanced by computer assisted data management identifying 
missing or possibly erroneous data as soon as data is entered into the syste m. This approach 
will allow initial remote monitoring, and communication between CRAs and site personnel 
before and between site visits, and will expedite data review and cleaning. Missing data and 
identified  data errors  (or possible  errors)  will be commun icated  by the CRAs  to site investigators 
using the Query feature in Tempo™ for correction or acknowledgement that data is correct as 
entered. As each subject’s data entry is completed and fully monitored with all queries 
resolved, that subject’s data will be locked by the CRA to only allow read access for the 
remainder of the  study.  
 
Tempo™ and all study data are housed in a secure computing environment. Tempo™ further 
provides a complete audit trail of all data entry, monitoring, and query activity. Tempo™ is 
compliant with HIPPA and meets all requirements for 21 CFR Part 11.

7.0 INVESTIGATOR TRAINING  
The investigators performing the epicardial ablation procedure portion of the study must be 
practicing cardio -thoracic surgeons. All study Investigators (whether they are performing the 
procedure or not) will be expected to complete Investigator training prior to participation in the 
study.  
 
All investigators performing the endocardial ablation procedure for both arms of the study will 
be practicing electrophysiologists and will have documented training for the endocardial 
ablation catheters and equipment used at their site.  
 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Safety data for the primary safety endpoint will be coll ected from the start of the coagulation 
procedure to 30 days post procedure. The primary safety endpoint will be an evaluation of the 
incidence of major adverse events (MAE) listed below for the procedural to 30 day post 
procedure time period, for each arm  of the study.  
 
The secondary safety endpoint for the study will be an analysis of the incidence of major 
adverse  events,  in each  arm of the study,  from 30 days  post procedure  through  the 12 months 
post procedure visit, for each arm of the  study.  
 
8.1 Major Ad verse Events (MAE)  
Events qualifying as MAEs as defined in 1.5.4 include:  
 
• Cardiac tamponade/perforation requiring pericardiocentesis or  thoracentesis  
• Severe Pulmonary Vein Stenosis (≥ 70%  occlusion)  
• Excessive bleeding requiring transfusion or > 20% drop i n HCT.  
• Myocardial  infarction  
• Stroke  
• Transient Ischemic Attacks  (TIA)  
• Atrioesophageal  fistula  
• Phrenic nerve injury  
• Death  
 
Any condition that was recorded as pre -existing is not a MAE unless there is a change in the 
nature, severity or degree of the condition.  
 
Sick Sinus Syndrome (SSS) and the implantation of a pacemaker for treatment of SSS post 
procedure will not be recorded as a MAE since it is a known underlying condition for patients 
with persistent AF and undergoing cardiac coagulation procedur es. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 55  
  
A serious adverse event by FDA definition is one that:  
• Results in a  fatality  
• Is life-threatening  
• Results in permanent disability  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongs a hospital  stay 
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of these  outcomes.  
Serious adverse events that are deemed device -related and/or procedure -related will be 
captured in the study.  
 
8.3 Device Related Adverse Effects  (DRAE)  
An adverse event will be considered to be related t o the device if it results from the use or 
presence  of the device,  or the performance  of any component  of the device.  Device  relatedness 
will be classified as either related or not related (for EPi -Sense -AF Guided Coagulation 
System).  
 
8.4 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE)  
A device or procedure related adverse effect will be considered unanticipated if it is not 
identified  in frequency, severity or nature in this protocol, or the EPi -Sense -AF Guided 
Coagulation System with VisiTrax Instructions for Use and the RF Generator operator’s 
manual. Events that are deemed device -related and unanticipated are to be reported to 
AtriC ure within 24 hours of the occurrence of the event, even if the event is not considered 
serious in nature.  
 
8.5 Adverse Event Reporting  
All DRAEs, and UADEs must be reported to AtriCure Surgical within 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of them. All SAEs and MAEs must be reported to AtriCure within 7 days of 
the site becoming aware of them. The participating sites will be responsible for reporting, as 
required by their IRBs, any AEs, SAEs, DRAEs and UADEs to their local regulatory bodies.  
 
Any death, pericardial effusion leading to therapeutic drainage, atrio -esophageal fistula or 
stroke  will be reported  to the FDA within  10 working  days  of AtriCure  becoming  aware  of these 
complications.  
 
One month safety data for the first 50 subjects in th e treatment arm will be submitted to the 
FDA for review.  
 
9.0 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  
9.1 Summary Descriptive  Statistics  
This randomized pivotal study plans to enroll 153 randomized subjects.  
 
Standard descriptive statistics will be used to summarize numeric variables, including the 
number of observed values, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
values. Summaries of categorical variables will include the number and percentage of 
observed values, at each level of the categorical variable.  
 
Base line and demographic information, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, 
BMI, and medical history will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics. Primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints, including AF/AT/AFL free and Class I and I II AAD status, 90% 
reduction in AF burden and Class I and III AAD status, and change in Quality of Life and 6 
minute walk test scores will be summarized by visit. Categorical summaries will be based on 
the number of subjects with an available assessment. Q OL measures will be summarized 
numerically including change from baseline and percent change from baseline to 12 months 
post procedure follow -up. 
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 55  
  
All safety data will be summarized descriptively and reported for the 30 days post-procedure 
and from 30 days to 12 months post -procedure time periods for the treatment groups.  
 
9.2 Sample Size  Justification  
The sample size is determined taking into consideration the primary endpoint of complete 
elimination of AF burden.  It is assumed t hat the success rate for the Control arm is 40%, and 
the study is designed to document superiority of EPi -Sense -AF with a 65% success rate. The 
sample size result, based on 2 -sided α = .05, 80% power, a 2:1 allocation of EPi -Sense - 
AF:Control, and a 10% dr op out rate, is 102:51 or 153 subjects.  
9.3 Analysis Populations  
The following populations will be defined for various analyses.  
9.3.1  Intention To Treat (ITT)  Population  
The ITT population will include all study subjects who receive a randomized procedure. This 
population will be used for all efficacy analyses. Subjects randomized but with no post - 
treatment assessments will be imputed (refer to Section 9.4).  
9.3.2  Modified Intention To treat (mITT)  Population  
The mITT population will include all study subjects who receiv e a randomized procedure and 
have at least one post -treatment follow -up visit. This population will be used for all efficacy 
analyses.  
9.3.3  Per Protocol (PP)  Population  
The PP population  will include  all study  subjects  who receive  their randomized  procedure  who 
have at least four of the five first year visits and who have no major protocol violations or 
deviations. This population will be used for the primary efficacy  analysis.  
9.3.4  Safety  Population  
The safety  population  will include  all subjects  who received  a randomized  procedure.  They  will 
be evaluated  on the procedure  received,  in the event  it differs  from the randomized  procedure. 
This population will be used for all safety  analyses.  
9.4 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Analysis  
The binary primary endpoint of success or failure to achieve freedom from AF/AT/AFL absent 
class  I and III AADs  except  for a previously  failed  or intolerant  class  I or III AAD with no increase 
in dosage  following  the 3 month  blanking  period  through  the 12 months  post procedure  follow - 
up visit will be compared between the two treatment groups using a chi -square test using a 
two-sided alpha of 0.05 to determine if superiority of the treatment arm is  attained.  
 
Define P as the true percentage of subjects failing to achie ve freedom. The hypothesis to test 
is: 
 
Ho: PT = PC vs Ha: PT ≠ PC 
 
where P T is the true failure rate for the Treatment arm and P C for the Control arm. The formula 
for the chi -square test is:  
𝑛𝑛  (𝑂𝑂 − 𝐸𝐸 )2 
𝜒𝜒2  = �        𝑖           𝑖 𝑖     𝑖  
 
𝑖𝑖=1 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 
where O i represents the number of observed events in the ith cell and E i represents the 
expected number of events in the ith cell. H o is rejected in favor of H a if the resulting p -value  
<0.05 and the estimated P t exceeds P c. 
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 55  
  
Subjects  who were  randomized  but have  no post-treatment  assessments  will be conservatively 
imputed as therapeutic failures at six  months.  
 
A tipping point analysisx will be conducted to explore the sensitivity of the results to the effect 
of missing data. Baseline demographics of subjects with missing data will be compared 
between the two treatment arms, as well as to those subjects without missing data, to explore 
whether there are any factors associated with having missing data.  
 
9.5 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  Analysis  
Secondary endpoints will be compared between tr eatment arms using either a chi -square test 
for binary  endpoints  or two-sample  Z-test, for numerical  endpoints.  All secondary  analyses  will 
be performed on the ITT population. Change and percent change in QOL will be compared 
between the two treatment groups using a two -sample Z -test at each visit based on available 
data.  
In addition, the primary analysis will be performed using the per protocol population.  
9.6 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  Analysis  
The analysis for exploratory endpoints will be determined once final decisions on exploratory 
endpoints are made. More information on exploratory endpoints analysis will be provided in 
the study Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
9.7 Primary Safety  Analysis  
The primary safety analysis will be to document an acceptable risk profile. This criterion will 
be defined  as an acceptable  level of MAEs.  It is estimated  that the true incidence  rate for MAEs 
in this study population is no more than 12%. A 95% one -sided confidence interval for the 
investigational treatment arm based on a 102 subject sample size is 5%, resulting in an upper 
bound of MAEs being less than 20%. This result would document an acceptable risk profile 
for the investigational  arm. 
9.8 Subgroup  Analysis  
A subgroup analysis will be conducted for the subgroups of gender, age, BMI, and left atrial 
size and volume. For each of these subgroup variables, a logistic regression model will be fit 
to the primary endpoint modeling for (1) treatment arm, (2) subgroup  variable, and (3) 
interaction term of treatment arm x subgroup variable. A two -tailed alpha level of 0.15 will be 
used for determining poolability of results.  
10.0 PATIENT INFORMED CONSENT  
The sponsor, AtriCure will provide a template informed consent to study sites for review and 
approval by the local Institutional Review Board (IRB). The template consent may be modified 
to the sites institutional requirements but must include all the required regulatory consent 
elements. The modified consent must be subm itted to the sponsor AtriCure for review prior to 
submitting to their Institutional IRB. All subjects must sign the IRB approved informed consent 
prior to enrollment in the study and the initiation of any study -related procedures.  
 
Additionally, each subje ct must consent to pertinent baseline and follow -up data affected by 
HIPAA for transfer from the appropriate cardiologists or primary care physician office to the 
study site. Due to the differences in state regulations affecting HIPAA, sites may supply the ir 
local consent document or language for inclusion in the study informed consent document. A 
copy of the IRB approved consent must be provided to the sponsor AtriCure Surgical for their 
records.

11.1 Risks Associated with the Clinical  Investigation  
A number  of complications  and adverse  events  that are known  to occur  in patients  undergoing 
surgical or endocardial ablations for symptomatic persistent AF may be anticipated during the 
course of this  study.  
 
In general, the device -related complications and adverse events reported in the historical 
literature are:  
 
• Cardiac arrest / myocardial  infarction  
• Thrombus formation (or thrombo -embolic  event)  
• Pulmonary vein  stenosis  
• Cardiac  tamponade  
• Pericardial  effusion  
• Esophageal  injury  
• Left atrium  rupture/perforation  
• Infection  
• Vessel  Injury  
• New arrhythmias  
• Neurologic  complication  
• Phrenic ner ve palsy  
• Excessive bleeding  
• Death  
• Complete heart block requiring permanent  pacemaker  
• Any other damage (e.g., burn, puncture) to other adjacent  structures  
• Vascular access  complications  
• Serious skin  burn 
• Pulmonary  edema  
• Pericarditis  
• Mediastinitis.  
11.2 Risk  Mitigation  
The protocol has been designed to minimize the risks to study subjects participating in the 
study. In particular:  
 
• Safety features:  Safety features incorporated into the EPi -Sense -AF Guided 
Coagulation System with VisiTrax mi nimize risks to the participating  subjects.  
• Investigator Selection:  Only practicing cardio -thoracic surgeons who are trained and 
experienced in cardiac surgical procedures and in endoscopic, minimally invasive 
techniques will be recruited to participate as  investigators and perform the epicardial 
ablation procedure. Only practicing electrophysiologists who are trained and 
experienced in AF catheter ablation procedures will be recruited to participate as 
investigators.  
• Investigator Training:  All study site i nvestigators (Cardiac Surgeons) performing the 
epicardial  ablation  using  the EPi-Sense -AF Guided  Coagulation  System  will participate 
in didactic training and a device/procedure training program. The combined training 
programs provide each surgeon with a th orough working knowledge of the protocol, 
applicable regulations and proper/safe use of the EPi -Sense -AF Guided Coagulation 
System with  VisiTrax.  
All study site investigators (Electrophysiologists) performing the endocardial catheter 
ablation will be experienced and will have been trained on the use of the endocardial 
catheter systems to be used for this study. The Electrophysiologists will be trained on 
the protocol and the study lesion patterns to be performed.  
• Patient Selection:  Potential study cand idates will be carefully screened for conditions 
that will not put them at higher risk for adverse events during study  participation.  
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 55  
  
• Subject Follow Up:  Subjects participating in this clinical study will be followed at 1 
month,  3 months  6 months,  and 12 months  post procedure  to evaluate  if subject  is not 
having any adverse complications and any concerns the subject may have are being 
addressed. Subjects w ill be also be followed long -term at a 18 month post procedure 
office visit and an annual phone follow -up at year 2, 3, 4, and 5 post  procedure.  
11.3 Justification for  Investigation  
The EPi -Sense -AF Guided Coagulation system is used to coagulate cardiac tissue by 
accessing the posterior cardiac epicardium via a cannula inserted through a 
transdiaphragmatic or sub -xyphoid access for introducing an endoscope and surgical 
instruments. The endoscopic transdiaphragmatic or sub -xyphoid epicardial ablation approach 
makes it feasible  to complete  a comprehensive  lesion  pattern  including  ablation  of the posterior 
left atrium.  In addition,  performing  epicardial  ablation  along  the pericardial  reflections  adjacent 
the pulmonary  veins  followed  by endocardial  catheter  ablation  to complete  the pulmonary  vein 
isolation and the cavotricuspid isthmus ablation to prevent typical AFL enables achieving 
conduction  block  as a truly minimally  invasive  approach  without  the need  for chest  incisions  or 
ports, lung deflation, or complex dissections of the pericardial  reflections.  
 
This multicenter randomized pivotal study is necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
the study  lesion  pattern  created  using  endoscopic  epicardial  ablation  with endocardial  catheter  
ablation to complete PVI. The potential benefits of a truly minimally invasive surgery for the 
treatment of symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation justifies this randomized pivotal study to 
collect clinical data to determine the safety and efficacy of  the study lesion pattern using the 
EPi-Sense -AF Guided Coagulation System with VisiTrax for the treatment of symptomatic 
persistent AF versus a standalone endocardial catheter  ablation.

12.2 Study  Oversight  
 
A Data safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be 
identified for this randomized pivotal  study. The DSMB and CEC will be made up of 
cardiothoracic  surgeons,  electrophysiologists  (EP) or cardiologists.  The DSMB  will also include 
a biostatistician.  
 
12.3 Monitoring  Procedures  
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 55  
  
AtriCure or their designee CRO will conduct regular clinical monitoring visits to each 
investigational site. Before beginning data collection for a given site, a site pre -study site 
qualification visit will be conducted. The objectives of this pre -study visit are:  
 
• to confirm that the Investigator and study  personnel fully understand the Clinical 
Investigation Plan, the data collection procedures and the requirements to be met 
before starting the  study;  
• to confirm that the Investigator and study personnel fully understand the procedures 
related to the selection of study subjects for this study;  and 
• to confirm that the Investigator and study personnel have appropriate knowledge, 
experience and equipment to comply with the study  requirements.  
 
Observations made during a pre -study visit will be documented by means of a pre -study 
monitoring report.  
 
To ensure that the Investigators and their staff members understand and accept their defined 
responsibilities,  the Clinical  Monitor  will maintain  regular  correspondence  and perform  periodic 
site visits during the  course of the study to verify the continued acceptability of the facilities, 
compliance with the Investigational Plan, conditions of the IRB and requirements of the IDE 
regulations, complete documentation and reporting of any complications and Unanticipat ed 
Adverse Device Effects, and the maintenance of complete records. Clinical monitoring will 
include review and resolution of missing or inconsistent results and source document checks 
(i.e., comparison of submitted study results to original reports) to as sure the accuracy of the 
reported data. The Clinical Monitor will evaluate and summarize the results of each site visit 
in written reports, identifying any repeated data problems with the Investigator and specifying 
recommendations for resolution of noted  deficiencies.  
12.4 Data Quality  Assurance  
Access for data entry into the electronic data capture system developed for the study will be 
provided to all Investigational Sites. The Investigator/Clinical Coordinator will be responsible 
for completion  and timely  input  of the study  data to facilitate  data processing  by the Sponsor  or 
designee.  
 
Data entered into the data capture system will be reviewed to identify inconsistent or missing 
data and Adverse  Events.  Data  problems  will be addressed  in calls to the Investigational  Sites 
and during site visits. All electronic data files will be secured to ensure  confidentiality.  
 
The Investigator is to maintain all source documents as required by the protocol, including 
laboratory results, supporting medical recor ds, and Informed Consents. The source 
documents will be used at the regular monitoring visits to verify information entered into the 
data capture system.  
 
12.5 Visit Boundaries and Missed  Visits  
 
Section 6.0 defines the tolerance range for each follow -up visit.  A visit that occurs outside of 
the specified  range  will be coded  using  the closest  follow -up window  and identified  as a protocol 
deviation on the study non -compliance log located within the site regulatory  binder.  
 
12.6 Subjects Lost -to-Follow -Up 
A subject will be considered lost -to-follow -up from the last missed clinical evaluation if all 
reasonable efforts made to contact the subject and request his continued participation in the 
study have failed. Telephone and written attempts  will be made to locate and return such 
individuals  to care.  At least  two certified  letters  must  be sent.  In instances  where  the individual 
cannot be located or traced, the circumstances leading to lost -to-follow -up status will be 
documented. All attempts to contact the subject will be  documented.  
AtriCure  Protocol No. VAL -1200(E)  
October 02, 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 55  
  
Study ID numbers assigned to subjects who are discontinued will not be reassigned to newly 
enrolled  subjects.  Whenever  possible,  subjects  who have  been  discontinued  for reasons  other 
than lost-to-follow -up will be contacted and requested to participate in ongoing safety data 
assessments conducted by  phone.  
 
12.7 Screened Subjects Who are Not Enrolled  
Only data for enrolled/randomized subjects will be monitored and entered into the database. 
Subjects who are screened  for the study  but are not enrolled  for any reason  will not be followed 
and AtriCure will not evaluate their data. The sites may retain the screening data forms for 
these subjects, at their  discretion.

 Convergent Epicardial and Endocardial Ablation Procedure  
 
Preoperative requirements and patient preparation should follow the Investigator’s and site’s 
standard of practice for closed chest, endoscopic epicardial and endocardial ablation 
procedures.  
 
Follow the standard lesion creation steps described below. Access the anatomical locations 
endoscopically, and cr eate the epicardial lesion pattern which includes ablating the posterior 
left atrium between the left and right pulmonary veins. If additional lesion(s) are created or 
suggested  lesions  are not created,  this must  be entered  into the electronic  data capture  system 
developed for the  study.  
 
The completion of each lesion may require multiple sequential placements. The lesions to be 
created in the treatment arm are as follows:  
 
Trans -Diaphragmatic Endoscopic Access  
Using standard laparoscopic surgical techniques for creating a pericardial window, obtain 
trans -diaphragmatic  access  to the posterior  surface  of the heart.  Create  an incision  3cm below 
the xyphoid  in the midline  of the abdomen.  Using  abdominal  CO 2 insufflation,  create  an incision 
through the central tendon of the diaphragm, above the liver and medial to the falciform 
ligament.  The cannula  provides  direct  access  to the posterior  surface  of the heart  and is sized 
to create space between the epicardium and the pericardium to visualize  cardiac structures 
and manipulate the coagulation device alongside an endoscope, so all device manipulations 
are performed under direct  visualization.  
After obtaining trans -diaphragmatic access, the Epi -Sense®-AF Guided Coagulation Device 
with VisiTrax®, cannula, scopes and surgical instruments are used to create the epicardial 
lesion pattern.  
Sub-Xyphoid Endoscopic  Access  
Using  standard  surgical  techniques  for creating  a pericardial  window  superior  to the diaphragm, 
obtain access to the posterior surface of the heart. Create an incision immediately inferior to 
the xyphoid process. Direct visualization of the pericardium superior to the diaphragm can be 
achieved through the incision. The xyphoid process may be removed, dependent on patient 
anatomy. A 2 cm incision should be made in the pericardium to allow access for the cannula. 
The cannula provides direct access to the posterior surface of the heart and is sized to create 
space between the epicardium and the pericardium to visualize cardiac structu res and 
manipulate the coagulation device alongside an endoscope, so all device manipulations are 
performed under direct  visualization.  
After obtaining Sub -Xyphoid access, the Epi -Sense®-AF Guided Coagulation Device with 
VisiTrax®, cannula, scopes and surgical instruments are used to create the epicardial lesion 
pattern.  
Esophageal Temperature Monitoring  
Esophageal temperature monitoring should be utilized during epicardial and endocardial 
ablation. At least one esophageal temperature probe should be po sitioned near the left atrium 
under fluoroscopic guidance. All other instrumentation including NG and OG tubes, and TEE 
probes need to be removed prior to placement of the esophageal temperature probe. 
Whenever  possible,  the position  of the probe  should  be interrogated  with fluoroscopy  to ensure 
proximity to the ablation electrode (epicardial or endocardial). If esophageal temperature 
increases more than 0.5°C during lesion creation or above an absolute maximum of 38.0°C, 
RF energy should be terminated unti l the temperature reduces to  baseline.

 Ablating Epicardial Tissue – The EPi -Sense -AF Device  
Epicardial lesions are created using the EPi -Sense -AF coagulation (e.g. “ablation”) device. 
The device  integrates  vacuum  contact  that ensures  continuous  lesions  with saline  perfusion  to 
cool the device surface not contacting epicardium and enable creating full thickness lesions. 
The addition of sensing electrodes helps guide energy delivery augmenting ablation 
directionality and detection of les ion completeness.  
• Vacuum is coupled to the ablation electrode ensuring the electrode contacts the 
epicardium. Consistent contact pressure ensures controllable heating along the 
electrode especially since the electrode incorporates a helical coil where indi vidual 
windings are separated to allow vacuum to pull tissue into engagement with each 
winding  such  that the current  density  profile  produces  a continuous  lesion  along  tissue 
pulled into engagement with the electrode. A stopcock allows turning vacuum on an d 
off. When moving the ablation electrode to another location, the stopcock should be 
actuated to discontinue vacuum until positioned at the target  location.  
• A separate perfusion lumen is connected to an unpressurized bag of saline. The 
perfusion lumen is coupled to the vacuum lumen such that when a vacuum seal is 
created, saline is pulled through the device at a set rate to cool the device so the 
heating is only directed into epicardium. Additionally, controlling the power, contact 
pressure, and perfusion allows controlled energy delivery to create consistent lesions 
that are continuous and extend to the endocardium with a reliable depth up to 7  mm.xi 
• The sensing  electrodes  on the EPi-Sense -AF device  may be utilized  to monitor  cardiac 
electrograms, transmitted through the sensing electrodes and to an external EP 
Recorder,  in order  to confirm  appropriate  positioning  of the EPi-Sense -AF coagulation 
electrodes against atrial tissue. The sensing electrodes may be interrogated before 
coagulation is initiated but after vacuum creates a seal and ensures the sensing 
electrodes  and coagulation  electrode  engage  tissue.  When  an atrial  signal  is identified, 
augmented by direct endoscopic visualization of device placement, energy may be 
transmitted through the coagulation electrode to create the desired lesion. When no 
signal or a ventricular signal is identified, then placement of the coagulation el ectrode 
relative to the left atrium should be re -evaluated.  
• Once position is confirmed visually and by interrogating the electrograms, RF energy 
is delivered to create each  lesion.  
• During  lesion  creation,  the electrograms  should  be interrogated  for amplitude  reduction 
that delineates the creation of a full thickness lesion capable of interrupting electrical 
propagation. This may be especially useful when epicardial fat causes several power - 
downs during RF energy delivery. The generator incorporates a safety mechanism to 
avoid overheating tissue by monitoring impedance and reducing power if impedance 
increases at a rate above a set threshold; afterward, the generator ramps power to its 
set value  unless  another  power -down  condition  (e.g. impedance  rise) is detected.  This 
function reduces the incidence of vaporization but may be a bit conservative when 
ablating  over fat since  the differences  in electrical  impedance  between  fat and muscle 
produces  more  rapid  heating  of fat that causes  more  frequent  power -downs  and lower 
efficiency of heating. As such, when ablating over fat, it is beneficial to ablate more 
than once to obtain the same full thickness lesion; a requirement that evaluating the 
change in electrograms will help  guide.  
• Saline may be inserted through the cannula to cool the pericardial space during 
epicardial ablation. When partially filling the pericardial space with fluid, a stopcock 
connected  to the cannula  vacuum  lumen  is turned  off until after ablation,  when  the fluid 
is removed. Whenever, esophageal temperature increases, saline may be used to 
flush and cool the pericardial space reducing esophageal  temperature.  
• After  creating  each  lesion,  the position  and extent  are interrogated  by visually

Epicardial Le sion Locations  
Left Posterior Pulmonary Vein Orifice Lesion  
• The posterior left pulmonary vein lesion(s) should be created adjacent the pericardial 
reflections along the left pulmonary veins. The location of this lesion(s) should be 
entirely on the left atr ium near the orifice and not extend onto the pulmonary veins 
themselves.  
• Under direct endoscopic visualization with an endoscope in the cannula, the 
coagulation device is advanced through the cannula and above the guidewire so it 
contacts the left atrium a djacent the left pulmonary veins. The device remains straight 
as it is positioned against the left atrium adjacent to the left pulmonary veins. The 
guidewire may function as an arm to help urge the coagulation device into position 
along the left  atrium.  
 
Right Posterior Pulmonary Vein Orifice Lesion  
• The posterior right pulmonary vein lesions should be created adjacent the pericardial 
reflections along the right pulmonary veins. The location of these lesions should be 
entirely on the left atrium near the or ifice and not extend onto the pulmonary veins 
themselves. These lesions should extend from the superior pericardial reflection 
adjacent the right superior pulmonary vein to the junction between the right inferior 
pulmonary vein and the inferior vena  cava.  
• Under direct endoscopic visualization with an endoscope in the cannula, the 
coagulation device is advanced through the cannula and above the guidewire so it 
contacts  the left atrium  adjacent  the right pulmonary  veins.  The device  remains  straight 
as it is positioned against the left atrium adjacent to the right pulmonary  veins.  
Posterior Parallel Vertical Connecting Lesions  
• Identify electrical activity for degree of baseline electrical  activity.  
• Connecting lesions oriented parallel to each other and extendi ng superior to inferior 
are created along the posterior left atrium between the left and right pulmonary veins. 
Number of parallel vertical lesions will depend on the size of the left atrium and the 
pericardial reflections’ anatomy. The posterior left atri um bounded by the pericardial 
reflections between the two sets of pulmonary veins (left and right) should be ablated 
so that subsequent  pacing  of the posterior  left atrium  in this region  is unable  to capture 
thereby demonstrating exit block and posterior isolation. Alternatively, mapping of this 
region should delineate scar tissue indicative of ablated  tissue.  
 
Left Anterior Pulmonary Vein Orifice Lesion  
• Position the cannula around the left pulmonary veins to access the left anterior 
pulmonary  vein orifice  posterior  to the left atrial  appendage.  Identify  the left pulmonary 
veins to position the coagulation device along the pulmonary vein  orifice.  
• Under direct endoscopic visualization, position the device through the cannula, and 
along the anterior  orifice of the left pulmonary veins towards the transverse sinus and 
the ligament of marshall such that the coagulation device remains posterior to the left 
atrial  appendage.  
• Ensure the exposed electrode of the device contacts the left pulmonary vein orif ice. 
Utilize the sensing electrodes to augment confirmation of device position prior to 
initiating RF energy  delivery.  
• Create a lesion that extends from the posterior left pulmonary vein lesion, along the 
anterior left pulmonary vein orifice, and past the ligament of marshall (LOM) to ablate 
the LOM.

Right Anterior Pulmonary Vein Orifice Lesion  
• Move  the cannula  around  the inferior  vena  cava  to access  the interatrial  groove  under 
the right atrial appendage. Identify the superior vena cava and the right pulmonary 
veins to position the coagulation device along the right pulmonary vein  orifice.  
• Under direct e ndoscopic visualization position the device through the cannula, and 
along the anterior orifice of the right pulmonary  vein.  
• Ensure the exposed electrode of the device contacts the right pulmonary vein orifice 
adjacent the interatrial groove. Utilize the s ensing electrodes to augment confirmation 
of device position prior to initiating RF energy  delivery.  
• Create a lesion that extends from the transverse sinus under the superior vena cava, 
along the left atrium at the orifice to the right pulmonary vein antru m, to the oblique 
sinus between the right pulmonary vein antrum and the inferior vena  cava.  
 
Transitioning Between Epicardial and Endocardial Components  
Closing Epicardial Access Sites  
• After  completing  all epicardial  lesions  and interrogating  the pericardial  space  to ensure 
hemostasis,  a pericardial  drain  is inserted  through  the cannula  and into the pericardial 
space ensuring the drain is sized such that the vacuum segment resides within the 
pericardial space. The cannula is removed leaving the dra in in place and the free end 
is pulled through one of the abdominal punctures utilizing a clamp or other surgical 
instrument. If a sub -xyphoid access has been utilized, a puncture incision shall be 
created  lateral  to the central  incision  to pass  the free end of the drain  out of the patient. 
The free end of the drain  is connected  to a vacuum  bulb to monitor  drainage  throughout 
the endocardial component of the  procedure.  
• Prior to closing abdominal incisions, hemostasis throughout the abdominal cavity 
should  be interrogated.  Abdominal  incisions  will be closed  in standard  fashion  utilizing 
standard general surgical techniques to reduce the potential for incisional  hernias.  
Endocardial Vascular Access  
• After closing all epicardial access sites, navigation patch positions are confirmed and 
patient draping for catheter ablation is adjusted. Using standard catheterization and 
sheath introduction techniques, access to the venous vasculature is  obtained.  
• A coronary  sinus  catheter  is introduced  to help monitor  atrial  electrograms,  serve  as a 
reference  catheter  for 3-D navigation,  and provide  electrodes  from which  pacing  stimuli 
can be  transmitted.  
• Transeptal  access is then obtained by puncturing the fossa ovalis under ultrasound 
(ICE or TEE) guidance to provide access to the left atrium. Two transeptal sheaths 
may be utilized to facilitate insertion of an ablation catheter and diagnostic circular 
catheter int o the left atrium. In certain circumstances, the ablation catheter may be 
inserted through the transeptal puncture site without the need for a  sheath.  
• Before or after transeptal access is obtained, heparin needs to be administered to 
assure ACTs between 30 0 and 400 seconds to protect against thrombus formation 
while catheter instrumentation resides within the left  atrium.  
• Mapping of the epicardial lesions in terms of locations and extents helps identify the 
breakthrough locations at the pericardial reflecti ons and guides endocardial ablation. 
Voltage maps are not required to identify breakthrough locations but may be used to 
augment identification of breakthrough locations if  desired.  
Ablating Endocardial Tissue  
• Specific endocardial lesions will be created with an open irrigated -tip RF ablation 
catheter having unidirectional or bidirectional  steering.  
• Specific commercially available RF ablation systems that may be utilized during the 
study may include Therapy™ Cool Path™ family of Irrigated Ablation Catheter  and

Catheter and associated accessories (St. Jude Medical, Inc.), or ThermoCool® family 
of Irrigated Tip Catheter and Integrated Ablation System (Biosense , Webster).  
• 3-D navigation utilizing a Carto™ EP Navigation System (Carto 3 or Carto XP), or an 
EnSite™  System  (NAVx™  or Velocity™)  may be utilized  to monitor  the position  of the 
ablation catheter electrode, facilitate endocardial mapping, and record ablation 
locations.  
 
Endocardial Connecting Lesions  
Right Superior Pulmonary Vein Lesions  
• Using standard pulmonary vein isolation techniques, the epicardial lesions should be 
connected  at breakthrough  locations  along  the pericardial  reflections  adjacent  the right 
superior pulmonary veins to complete isolation of the right pulmonary veins and 
produce a barrier against signal propagation from the PVs to the left atrium and vice 
versa. A circular catheter may be utilized to identify the gaps along the pericard ial 
reflection that needs to be ablated endocardially. Point lesions are created with a 
saline irrigated ablation catheter and standard left -sided catheter ablation techniques 
such that they interconnect into a series that connect the epicardial linear les ions 
together.  
• Since two pericardial reflections (one superior and one inferior) connect the 
pericardium to the left atrium adjacent the right pulmonary veins, both gap locations 
should be ablated prior to evaluating pulmonary vein isolation. Even if the s uperior 
gap is ablated,  the carina  allows  communication  from the inferior  pulmonary  vein to the 
superior vein and vice versa. Only ablating both gaps along the pericardial reflections 
will produce isolation of the right pulmonary  veins.  
• Pulmonary vein isolation should be confirmed using entrance and/or exit block to 
ensure the breakthrough locations at the pericardial reflections have been adequately 
closed.  
 
Right Inferior Pulmonary Vein  Lesions  
• Using standard pulmonary vein isolation techniques, the e picardial lesions should be 
connected  at breakthrough  locations  along  the pericardial  reflections  adjacent  the right 
inferior  pulmonary  veins  to complete  isolation  of the right pulmonary  veins  and produce 
a barrier against signal propagation from the PVs to the left atrium and vice versa. A 
circular  catheter  may be utilized  to identify  the gaps  along  the pericardial  reflection  that 
needs to be ablated endocardially. Point lesions are created with a saline irrigated 
ablation catheter and standard left -sided catheter ablation techniques such that they 
interconnect into a series that connect the epicardial linear lesions  together.  
• Since two pericardial reflections (one superior and one inferior) connect the 
pericardium to the left atrium adjacent the right  pulmonary veins, both gap locations 
should be ablated prior to evaluating pulmonary vein isolation. Even if the superior 
gap is ablated,  the carina  allows  communication  from the inferior  pulmonary  vein to the 
superior vein and vice versa. Only ablating both will produce isolation of the right 
pulmonary  veins.  
• Pulmonary vein isolation should be confirmed using entrance and/or exit block to 
ensure the breakthrough locations at the pericardial reflections have been adequately 
closed.  
 
Left Superior  Pulmonary Vein Ridge Lesions  
 
• Using standard pulmonary vein isolation techniques, the epicardial lesions should be 
connected at breakthrough locations along the pericardial reflections adjacent the  left

 superior pulmonary veins and along the ridge between the pulmonary veins and the 
left atrial appendage to complete isolation of the left pulmonary veins and produce a 
barrier against signal propagation from the PVs to the left atrium and vice versa. A 
circular catheter may be utilized to identify the gap along the pericardial reflection that 
needs to be ablated endocardially. Point lesions are created with a saline irrigated 
ablation catheter and standard left -sided catheter ablation techniques such that th ey 
interconnect into a series that connect the epicardial linear lesions together.  
• Pulmonary vein isolation should be confirmed using entrance and/or exit block to 
ensure the breakthrough locations at the pericardial reflections have been adequately 
closed . 
 
Induced or Organized Atrial Arrhythmias  
• If atrial fibrillation organizes into an atrial arrhythmia (AFL, AT, AVNRT, etc.) or if an 
atrial arrhythmia is induced during Isoproterenol administration or rhythm challenging 
exercises,  then mapping  and localiz ed endocardial  ablation  may be performed  to target 
the specific atrial  arrhythmia.  
• CFAE ablation and linear endocardial lesions outside the prespecified pattern should 
be avoided.  
 
Cavotricuspid  Isthmus (Typical Atrial Flutter) Lesions  
• After creating all left atrial lesions, sheaths may be removed from the left atrium and 
heparinization  interrupted  characteristic  of no longer  needing  to maintain  ACTs  300 to 
400 seconds without instrumentation in the left  atrium.  
• Irrespective of inducibility, a cavotricuspid isthmus, right atrial typical flutter lesion 
should be  created.  
• Using  standard  endocardial  ablation  techniques,  a segment  of right atrium  defining  the 
cavotricuspid  isthmus  between  the inferior  vena  cava  and the tricuspid  valve  is ablated 
to interrupt a known pathway for typical atrial  flutter.  
• Bidirectional  block  should  be confirmed  across  the isthmus  lesion  to ensure  integrity  of 
the connecting point  ablations.  
 
Post -Operative Management  
• Drainage from the pericardial drain should be interrogated to monitor potential for 
bleeding or fluid build -up that could cause a pericardial effusion prior to removal. 
Recommendation from best practice symposiums is to leave the drain in place until 
drain output is less than a threshold of 50 -100cc in a 24 hr  period.  
• A trans -thoracic echocardiography will be performed at 7+7 days post -operative to 
evaluate the patient for pericardial  effusion.  
• Recommendation from best practice symposiums is to administer a prophylactic 
regimen of steroids (and/or non -steroidals) to prevent Dressler’s Syndrome, 
Pericarditis, and other inflammatory mechanisms that have been shown to cause late 
pericardial effusions, provided the patient i s able to tolerate such  regimen.

 Endocardial Catheter Ablation Procedure  
 
Preoperative requirements and patient preparation should follow the Investigator’s and site’s 
standard of practice for left -sided catheter ablation procedures.  
 
Follow the suggested lesion creation steps described below. Access the anatomical locations 
endocardially,  and create  the lesion  pattern  which  includes  isolating  the left and right pulmonary 
veins,  connecting  the PV isolation  lesions  with an atrial  roof lesion,  performing  < 30 minutes  of 
CFAE  ablation  if the rhythm  does  not convert  into SR or organize  into an AFL/AT,  mapping  and 
ablating AFLs/ATs induced, and ensuring bidirectional block across a cavotricuspid isthmus 
lesion. If additional lesion(s) are created or suggested lesions are not created, this must be 
entered into the electronic data capture system developed for the  study.  
 
Endocardial Access  
• Using standard catheterization and sheath introduction techniques, access to the 
venous vasculature is  obtained.  
• A coronary  sinus  catheter  is introduced  to help monitor  atrial  electrograms,  serve  as a 
reference  catheter  for 3-D navigation,  and provide  electrodes  from which  pacing  stimuli 
can be  transmitted.  
• For transeptal  procedures,  heparin  needs  to be administered  to assure  ACTs  of 300 to 
400 seconds to protect against thrombus formation while catheter instrumentation 
resides within the left  atrium.  
• Transeptal  access  is obtained  prior to or after fully heparinizing  the patient.  Transeptal  
access is obtained by puncturing the fossa ovalis under ultrasound (ICE or TEE) 
guidance to provide access to the left atrium. Frequently, two trasseptal sheaths may 
be utilized  to facilitate  insertion  of an ablation  catheter  and diagnostic  circular  cathe ter 
into the left atrium. Alternatively, the ablation catheter may be inserted through the 
transeptal puncture site without the need for a  sheath.  
 
Esophageal Temperature Monitoring  
Esophageal temperature monitoring should be utilized during endocardial ablation. At least 
one esophageal temperature probe should be positioned along the left atrium under 
fluoroscopic guidance. All other instrumentation including NG and OG tubes, and TEE probes 
need to be removed prior to placement of the esophag eal temperature probe. Whenever 
possible, the position of the probe should be interrogated with fluoroscopy to ensure proximity 
to the ablation electrode. If esophageal temperature increases more than 0.5°C during lesion 
creation or above an absolute maxim um of 38.0°C, RF energy should be terminated until the 
temperature reduces to baseline.  
 
 
Ablating Endocardial Tissue  
• Specific endocardial lesions will be created with an open irrigated -tip RF ablation 
catheter having unidirectional or bidirectional  steering.  
• Specific commercially available RF ablation systems that may be utilized during the 
study may include Therapy™ Cool Path™ family of Irrigated Ablation Catheter and

Endocardial Lesions  
The completion of each lesion described below may require multiple sequential placements. 
The suggested sequence of steps for lesion creation, are as follows:  
 
Left Pulmonary Vein Encircling Lesions  
• Using standard pulmonary vein isolation techniques, lesions encircling the left 
pulmona ry veins should be created. A circular catheter may be utilized to guide 
creation of point lesions that interconnect into a series capable of interrupting 
propagation  of electrical  signals  from the atrium  to the pulmonary  veins  and vice versa.  
 
Right Pulmo nary Vein Encircling Lesions  
• Using standard pulmonary vein isolation techniques, lesions encircling the right 
pulmonary veins should be created. A circular catheter may be utilized to guide 
creation of point lesions that interconnect into a series capable of interrupting 
propagation  of electrical  signals  from the atrium  to the pulmonary  veins  and vice versa.  
 
Anterior Left Atrial Roof Connecting Lesions  
• A left atrial roof lesion composing point ablations that connect the right and left 
pulmonary  vein encircling  lesions  should  be completed.  This series  of connecting  point 
lesions should be interrogated to ensure completeness of the line capable of 
interrupting the propagation of electrical  signals.  
 
Additional Endocardial Left Atrial Lesions  
• If the rhythm does not organize into an atrial tachycardia (AT) or atrial flutter (AFL), or 
convert to sinus rhythm after completing pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and the roof 
lesion,  then the electrophysiologist  may spend  up to 30 min performing  CFAE  ablation. 
The electrophysiologist may elect to convert the patient into sinus rhythm prior to 
endocardial mapping and ablation without performing CFAE ablation. CFAEs should 
be defined as constant activities or local activity with electrogram cycle length <120 
msec.xii,xiii CFAE ablation must not involve creating linear  lesions.  
• If the patient still does not organize into an AT, AFL, or SR after CFAE ablation then 
the patient should be converted by administeri ng Ibutilide or electrical  cardioversion.  
 
Induced or Organized Atrial Arrhythmias  
• If atrial fibrillation organizes into an atrial arrhythmia (AFL, AT, AVNRT, etc.) or if an 
atrial arrhythmia is induced during Isoproterenol administration or rhythm challen ging 
exercises,  then mapping  and localized  endocardial  ablation  may be performed  to target 
the specific atrial  arrhythmia.  
 
Cavotricuspid Isthmus (Typical Atrial Flutter) Lesions  
• After creating all left atrial lesions, sheaths may be removed from the left atrium and 
heparinization  interrupted  characteristic  of no longer  needing  to maintain  ACTs  of 300 
to 400 seconds without instrumentation in the left  atrium.

 PV Conduction Block Confirmation Protocol 
Testing Conduction block in the Pulmonary Veins (PVs)  
Procedure to test for conduction block must be performed and conduction block should be 
confirmed aft er the protocol required lesion pattern has been created. The pacing and / or 
electrogram  recording  equipment  standard  for the EP Lab at the site should  be used  to test for 
conduction exit or entrance  block.  
To Test block:  
 
• Use an ablation  device  or diagnostic  circular  catheter  to record  electrograms  from, 
and/or transmit pacing stimuli to the pulmonary vein antrum distal to the lesion, 
away from the left  atrium.  
Exit Block Testing:  
• Ensure patient is in sinus rhythm. If patient is not in sinus rhythm,  attempt to 
cardiovert the patient into sinus rhythm in order to  pace  
• Connect catheter pacing electrodes to EP  stimulator  
• Set pacing amplitude to ≥10  mA 
• Ensure pacing rate is greater than the baseline heart  rate 
• Confirmation is achieved by not capturing heart rate despite transmitting pacing 
pulses to the PV antrum (for  PVI).  
Entrance Block Testing  
• Patient may be in AF when testing entrance  block  
• Connect sensing electrodes of an ablation catheter or diagnostic circular catheter 
to an EP recordin g system  
• Monitor cardiac electrograms from sensing electrodes in bipolar  orientation  
• Place sensing electrodes on PV antrum distal to the PV isolation lesion(s) for 
demonstrating PVI  
 
Confirmation  of Pulmonary  Vein Isolation  (PVI)  is achieved  by determining  lack of electrogram 
signals on PVs, inability to capture when pacing the PVs, or dissociation of cardiac signals 
along PVs from resting heart demonstrating PV  isolation.

The protocols for the use of class I or III AADs recommended in the 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS 
expert consensus statement and the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of 
Patients with AF should be followed to manage the AAD therapy for subjects enrolled in both 
arms of the study.  
 
Post procedure,  subjects  enrolled  in both arms  of the study  should  be prescribed  class  I or class 
III AADs the subject was taking prior to study enrollment or another failed class I or III AAD. 
Subjects  who have  a contraindication  for class  I or class  III AADs  should  be followed  as medically 
indicated.  
 
All subjects should be weaned off their class I or III AAD at their 3 month post procedure follow - 
up visit unless the AADs are medically indicated or the subject is maintained on the same or 
lower dose of a  previously failed class I or III AAD and the attending physician recommends 
continuation of such medical management prophylactically.

Anticoagulation Protocol  
 
The anticoagulation strategies recommended in the 2012 HRS/EHRA/ECAS expert consensus 
statement on catheter and surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation should be followed to manage the 
anticoagulation therapy for subjects enrolled in both arms of the study.  
 
Pre-procedure  
• Systemic  anticoagulation  at a therapeutic  level should  be maintained  3 to 4 weeks  prior to 
the procedure.  
• A TEE or ICE evaluation should be performed prior to the ablation procedure, to evaluate 
for the presence or absence of left atrial  thrombus.  
• The presence of a left atrial thrombus is an intra -op study  exclusion.  
During the procedure  
• An ACT of 300 to 400 secs should be maintained during the endocardial catheter ablation 
procedure.  
• Administration of protamine following ablation to reverse heparin should be  considered.  
Post -procedure  
• Systemic  anticoagulation  therapy  should  be initiated  for all patients  post procedure  through 
at least two months following the ablation  procedure.  
• Decisions regarding the use of systemic anticoagulation more than two months following 
ablation  should  be based  on the patient’s  risk factors  for stroke  and not on the presence  or 
type of  AF. 
• Discontinuation of systemic anticoagulation therapy post ablation is generally not 
recommended in patients who are at high risk of stroke as estimated by currently  
recommended schemes (CHADS 2 or CHA 2DS 2VAS C).

Repeat Catheter Ablation Protocol  
 
In the event that  an AF/AFL/AT reoccurs post procedure for a subject in either the treatment arm 
or control arm of the study and a repeat catheter ablation procedure is performed, various 
diagnostics should be performed to evaluate reasons for failure of the index procedur e. 
 
Voltage mapping to be performed to determine and document the breakthrough locations and 
extents  
 
Interrogate and Complete Pulmonary Vein Isolation  
• Pulmonary vein isolation should be determined for each vein and documented as to 
whether they remained i solated or did they  reconnect.  
• The location and extent of breakthroughs to the reconnected pulmonary veins should be 
determined for each vein and  documented.  
 
Interrogate Reoccured Posterior Electrical Activity  
• The posterior left atrium should be evaluated with respect to electrical activity. Voltage 
mapping should be performed to document the degree of electrical silencing along the 
posterior left atrium.  
 
Document Ablation Locations  
• All endocardial ablation locations should be documented; 3 -D navigation tools help to 
identify and document the locations and extents of endocardial  ablation.

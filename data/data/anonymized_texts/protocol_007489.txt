 Fluoxetine to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality with COVID -19 infection  
Cheryl McCullumsmith, MD PhD, Principal Investigator  
 
1. Background, Review of the Literature, Significance  
Much of the morbidity and mortality with COVID -19 infection is thought to be the result of 
multisystem organ failure after a cytokine storm (Huang et al. Lancet  2020). This cytokine storm is 
very similar if not identical to the Secondary Hemophagochytic Ly mphohistiocytosis (SHLH)  seen in 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrom ( SARS ) also caused by a coronavirus,  and includes increased 
levels of IL -2, IL -7, C-CSF, TNF -2, interferon -G inducible protein, MCP1 and MIP1a, all of which are 
driven by increased levels o f IL-6. (Taraz 2013, Gobin, 2014) These findings have led to use of 
medications such as tocilizumab, an IL -6 receptor antagonist, to  treat COVID -19 pneumonia.  
Fluoxetine and certain other s elective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have demonstrated i n vitro 
and in vivo efficacy at reducing IL -6 and both preventing and treating hyperimmune responses 
associated with elevated levels of IL -6. Fur ther, fluoxetine has a very safe therapeutic profile  and could 
be used both prophylactically to prevent the cyt okine storm with COVID -19, as well as an adjuvant 
treatment for critically ill patients.  
In vitro  and in vivo  data demonstrate that fluoxetine and some other selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) effectively reduce IL -6 to prevent hyperimmune re sponse. In addition to 
SSRI use in adjuvant treatment for critically ill patients, the established safety profiles of many SSRIs 
allow these drugs to be used prophylactically in order to prevent cytokine storm associated with 
COVID -19 infections. SSRI trea tment before starting antiviral therapies reduces incidence of 
interferon -induced depression and carries minimal side effect profiles consisting of rare 
dizziness  (Udina et al., 2014). The SSRI fluoxetine demonstrates a particularly pronounced ability to 
inhibit IL -6 activation  (Durairaj, Steury, & Parameswaran, 2015; Hashiok a et al., 2007). This  effect is 
mediated by non -serotonergic pathways involving NF -kB suppression and inhibition of dendritic cell 
antigen presentation  (Branco -de-Almeida et al., 2011; D. Liu et al., 2011; R. P. Liu et al., 2014; 
Vollmar, Haghikia, Dermietzel, & Faustmann, 2008; Young et al., 2014). Animal models demonstrate 
that SSRIs protect against hyperinflammatory conditions and diseases states. In fact, pretreatment with 
fluoxetine  frequently outperforms pretreatment with  corticosteroids   (Dong et al., 2016). Recently, 
clinical trials have demonstrated compelling relationships between SSRI treatment and cytokine 
levels  (Amitai et al., 2016). A recent 2019 review and meta -analysis by  Wang et al. echoes previous 
animal work and suggests that SSRI therapy indeed reduces IL -6 levels in human subjects  (Wang et 
al., 2019).  
3 
 These data are significant to COVID -19 patients at risk for pulmonary symptoms. Pretreatment 
with SSRIs results in dec reased destructive immune reactions across a variety of animal models. In rat 
models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, fluoxetine decreases lung injury and inhibits 
cytokines such as TNF -a and IL -6 (Cai et al., 2017). Indeed, fluoxetine reduces inf lammatory reaction 
in several models of human disease, providing marked decreases in reactive cytokines  (Roumestan et 
al., 2007). In addition to decreasing expression of inflammatory cytokines, pretreatment with 
fluoxetine also decreases incidence of pulmo nary arterial hypertension, pulmonary arterial 
muscularization, and extracellular matrix  remodeling   (Li et al., 2011). Bronchial asthma models show 
therapeutic effects of fluoxetine pretreatments in rats  (Sherkawy, Abo -Youssef, Salama, & Ismaiel, 
2018), a nd several studies suggest positive therapeutic efficacy may be concurrent with reduced levels 
of cytokines including IL -6 (Blatteau et al., 2012; Blatteau et al., 2015).  
Overall, there is significant preclinical data supporting the use of SSRI’s in the abrogation of harmful 
inflammatory side effects, such as those driving COVID19 morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, 
clinical data shows robust safety and efficacy profiles supporting the use of fluoxetine pretreatment 
interventions. At the University of T oledo Medical Campus, we are fortunate to have a leading expert 
on the relationship between antidepressant drugs and their anti -inflammatory therapeutic effects. Dr. 
Kevin Pan, who will be leading the laboratory work described in this proposal, has publish ed 
extensively on the use of antidepressants to limit organ damage, decrease pro -inflammatory cytokine 
production, and inhibit intracellular migration of early -stage inflammatory response   (Lu, Wang, Chen, 
Jiang, & Pan, 2020). A recent Nature publication f rom Dr. Pan and his team explore connections 
between antidepressant drug administration and cytokine signaling, providing compelling support for 
the use of antidepressants in inflammatory disease states. Several studies from Pan et al. indicate 
antidepress ant use inhibits pro -inflammatory cytokine gene expression both  in vitro  and in vivo . Using 
Dr. Pan’s methods, we will assay and investigate cytokine expression in our control and experimental 
patients while utilizing the expertise that Dr. Pan and his Uni versity of Toledo researcher team has 
developed on this topic.  
 Further evidence for the efficacy of fluoxetine in decreasing the IL -6 response that stimulates 
the cytokine storm in COVID -19 infection comes from an analysis comparing the transcriptomes of  
cells lines treated with fluoxetine, dexamethasone (a steroid established to decrease IL -6), and 2 other 
antidepressants : bupropion and paroxetine to the transcriptome of the same cell line with a knock 
down in the IL -6 signal transduction molecule. This  analysis was performed this week in the 
bioinformatics group in the Department of Neurosciences at University of Toledo and is illustrated 
4 
 below. The concordance of the fluoxetine and IL -6ST knockdown cell lines is remarkably high, 
averaging over 0.7 . Th is concordance is greater than that seen with dexamethasone treatment, the 
standard anti -inflammatory steroid, and is higher than 2 other commonly used antidepressants, 
bupropion and paroxetine.  
 
2. Objectives/Specific Aims  
 
Aim 1:  Fluoxetine treatment begun early after COVID -19 infection will reduce hospitalizations, 
intubations, and death from COVID -19 and complications more than no medication  
Aim 2:   Fluoxetine will decrease intubations and mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID -19 
infection greater than no medication.  
Aim 3  : Fluoxetine treatment of COVID -19 infected patients will not cause significant side effects or 
increase morbidity and mortality compared to no medication  
Aim 4.   Collect blood samples from 40 subjects for future c ytokine analysis: both subjects taking 
fluoxetine and not taking fluoxetine samples taken at baseline and weekly after study initiation.  00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9

d) Justification of the number of subjects  
All power calculations were done with the clincalc program and assume a dichotomous endpoint in 
a two independent sample study and are based on  achieving the standards of a power of 0.80 and 
with an alpha of 0.05. P lease note, that the assumptions of fluoxetine effect size are based on the 
absolute most conservative values in the published literature reviewed above.  
Aim 1 : Hospitalization rates  
Assumptions:  
1. 2/3 of patients who enter the trial will choose to take fl uoxetine  
2. 10% of COVID -19 + patients will progress to a clinical condition requiring hospitalization  
3. Fluoxetine treatment decreases hospitalization rate by 50%  
Sample Size : 312 in the no medication group and 624 in the 2 fluoxetine groups, for a total sample 
size of 936. This sample size is very achievable given the current coronavirus pandemic.

weeks 12 and 24 or earl y withdrawal
Target Biomarker Endpoints: The target biomarker e ndpoints are the blood eosinophil 
counts at DoR /baseline; weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,and24 or early withdrawal; and at the follow -
up visit (approximately  week 32).
Immunogenicity Endpoints: The immunogenicity endpoints are the immunogenicity  
incidence and the impact of ADA on clinical outcomes. The drug -emergent ADA response 
will be identified by  analyzing ADA test results for serum samples obtained before the 
administration of study  drug at DoR/baseline; weeks 4, 8 12, and 24 or early  withdrawal; and 
at th
e follow-up visit (approximately  week 32). An additional sample will be obtained at the 
late follow -up visit (approximately  week 48).
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints: There are no specific endpoints related to PK. Measured 
concentrations will be used to characte rize the PK of sc reslizumab in the studied popu lation 
and to explore exposure -response relationships. Serum reslizumab concentrations will be 
determined from blood samples collected from each patient at DoR/baseline; and prior to 
study drug administration at weeks 4, 8 12, and 24 or earl y withdrawal; and at the follow -up 
visit (approximately  week 32). An additional PK sample will be obtained at the late follow-
up visit (approximately  week48).

General Design and Methodology:
This is a Phase 3, 24- week, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study  to evaluate the 
efficacy and safet y of sc reslizumab treatment at a dosage of 110 mg every 4 weeks in patients 
12years of age and older with OCS -dependent asthma and elevated blood eosinophils. The study  
will consist of a screening period of up to 2 weeks, followed by  an optimization period of up to 
10weeks, a run-in period of at least 2 weeks, a 24 -week double -blind treatment period, an 
8-week follow -up period, and an additional 16- week follow -up period to collect drug wash -out 
samples for immunogenicity  assessments. The patient may  delay the early and/or late follow -up 
visits if the pa tient enrolls in an open -label,long-term safetystudy after end of treatment, if 
available.
During the optimization period, the patient’s minimal effective OCS requirement will be 
determined. The patient’s previous OCS will be standardized to an equivalent dose and regimen 
of prednisone to the nearest 2.5 mg daily. The patient’s previous non-OCS background asthma 
controller medications will be continued unchanged throughout the pre -randomizatio n period and 
the entire study. At the beginning of the optimization period, an asthma s ymptom diary  and 
electronic peak flow meter will be distributed where the patient will record asthma sy mptoms, 
number of reliever bronchodilator inhalations, nighttime a wakenings due to asthma requiring 
rescue inhaler , and AM and PMPEF. For optimization, the OCS dose should be reduced at 1 -
week intervals, for up to 10 weeks or until there is a worsening of asthma signs and s ymptoms
(minimum 1day in optimization) . When either a lung function or s ymptomatic deterioration 
occurs, the patient will be returned to the previously  effective OCS level, which will then 
constitute the minimally  effective dose for the purpose of run- in. If this previously  effective dose 
is no longer effective, the investigator can determine the clinicall y appropriate ,minimally  
effective dose for the purpose of run -in.Note: Patient may  enter run -in (V12) on the same day  as 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
12optimization ended if the patient is on the minimally  effective prednisone dose (did not require a 
prednisone burst at end -optimization).
Patients whose minimal effective OCS dose remains between≥5 mgand ≤40 mgof prednisone 
daily at the end of optimization may  advance to run -in. During run- in, patients will continue to 
keep their daily asthma control diary and a PEF meter to perform dail y self-monitoring of asthma 
symptoms while maintaining their minimally  effective OCS dose and previous background 
asthma medications unchanged. The last 7 day s of run-in will constitute the baseli ne level of 
control for analy sis and as the basis for OCS reduction algorithm to be used during the treatment 
period.The optimization period will be considered finished when patients experience a 
worsening of asthma signs and sy mptoms or if a patient op t
imizes to an OCS dose of <5 mg 
without a worsening of asthma signs and s ymptoms.
The post-randomization period consists of the treatment period, follow -up visitand late follow -
up visit. During the treatment period ,the patient will continue his/her usual non -OCS 
background asthma medication without change; the OCS dose will be tapered per protocol. The 
treatment periods consist of an induction period and an OCS reduction period. During the 
induction period, the mini mally effective dose of OCS will be maintained, unchanged, during the 
first 4 week s of the treatment period. During the OC S reduction period, t he minimally  effective 
OCS dose will be reduced per protocol at scheduled clinic visits from the beginning of 
week 5 
(ie, end of the induction period) through week20. If the OCS dose could not be decreased, it 
should be held constant, or may  be increased to a previous level, at the investigator’s discretion, 
until the next study  visit at which dosereduction criteri a are met. This dose will be maintained 
for the final 4 weeks of the treatment period.
If a patient elects to withdraw (or is discontinued from treatment b y the investigator), every  
attempt will be made to continue the assessments subsequent to his/her wit hdrawal from the 
study.
Method of Blinding and Randomization: Patients will receive sc placebo or reslizumab 110 
mg on a 1:1 basis in a randomized, double -blind fashion. Randomization will be assigned using 
interactive response technology . After randomization, patients and investigators will remain 
blinded to randomized treatment assignment during the stud y. The sponsor’s personnel involved 
in the study  will be blinded to the study  drug identity  after the run -in period until the database is 
lockedfor analysis and the treatment assignment is revealed, with the 
exception of the 
bioanalytical group (Global Bioassay s and Technology ), who, in order to facilitate PK and ADA 
sample anal ysis, will not be blinded . Eosinophils 
and monocy tes will be redacted from the from 
the post baseline differential cell count reports to avoid the possibility  of removing the blind.
In order to achieve balance between treatment groups in regard to average daily  OCS 
use/requirement, r andomization will be stratified by optimized, average daily  OCS dose of >10 
mg or ≤10 mg and age (12 to <
18years of age or ≥ 18 years of age) at baseline.
Study Drug Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate: Reslizumab will be 
administered as a fixed dose of 110 mg, as a 
scinjection in the upper arm(s) once every 4 weeks.
Investigational Product: Reslizumab for sc injection will be provided as a sterile solution 
presented as 110 mg (1 mL) per prefilled s yringe, formulated at 110 mg/mL in sodium 
acetate, with  sucros e,  poly sorbate 80, pH 5.5 buffer.

13Reference Therapy: 
Placebo: Diluent solution administered sc
Comparison Drug: None
Duration of Patient Participation: The duration of patient participation is up to 62weeks, 
including up to 2 weeks to satisfy  screening criteria, up to 10 week s to optimize OCS dose, a 
minimum 2 -weekrun-in period on the optimized OCS dose, a 24 -weektreatment period, and a n
8-weekfollow-up visit. I t is expected that the optimization period will be shorter than 10 weeks 
for those patients who are at or near their optimal corticosteroid dose at enrollment. An 
additional late follow- up visit for immunogenicity  testing will be performed 28 weeks afte r the 
last dose of study  drug.
Criteria for Inclusion: Patients may  be included in the study  only if they meet all of the 
following criteria: 
a.The patient is male or female, 12 years of age and older , with a previous diagnosis of 
asthma.Patients 12 to <18 y ears of age are excluded from participating in South 
Korea, the Netherlands,and Argentina, and patients 66 y ears of age and older are 
excluded from participating in South Korea.
b. Written informed consent is obtained. A patient 12 through <18 yearsof age must 
provide assent and his/her parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must provide consent.
c.The patient continues to require an average daily  maintenance dose of OCS for 
asthma of between 5 and 40 mg of prednisone or equivalent during the 3 months 
beforescreening. Patients on an OCS dose of >40 mg at screening who the 
investigator believes may be able to decrease OCS dose to ≤40 mg during the 
optimization period may  also be enrolled. Note: every-other-day dosing that is within 
this daily average ( ie,10 to 80 mg) is allowed.
d. The patient has a documented blood eosinophil level of at least 300/L during the 
previous 12 months while on at least medium total daily dose of inhaled 
corticosteroid (ICS) based on Global Initiative for Asthma 2016 clinical 
comparability  table (Appendix Aof the  protocol ), or ≥300/L at screening while on 
chronic OCS or that becomes manifest during the OCS optimization period or at the 
week -2 visit(end of optimization period/beginning of run- in period) .
e.The patient has required at least 880 μg of inhaled fluticasone propionate or 
equivalent dail y PLUS another controller(s) (eg, long-actingbeta-agonist[LABA], 
long-actinganti-muscarinic antagonist , leukotriene inhibitor, or theophy lline), or 
documented intolerance to another controller, for at least 6 months beforethe 
screening visit. For a fixed-dose ICS/LABA preparation, the highest labeled dose in 
that region will satisfy  this criterion. For patients 12 through <18years of age, the 
ICS dose must correspond to at least a medium total dailyICS dose. Note: the dose 
and regime n of asthma controllers and an y allergen immunotherapy should have been 
stable during the 30 day s beforesigning the Informed Assent Form/Informed Consent 
Form (ICF).
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
14f.The patient has FEV 1reversibility  of at least 12% after administration of inhaled 
relievermedication according to the standard American Thoracic Societ y (ATS) or 
European Respiratory  Society (ERS) protocol. Given the refractory  nature of the 
disease in this population and the influence of high background controller 
medications on rever sibility testing, documented FEV 1reversibility  of 12% or a
provocation concentratio n producing a 20% fall in FEV1for methacholine of ≤8 
mg/mLwithin 24 months of the screening visit, and performed according to the 
standard ATS /ERS procedures, would fulfi ll this criterion. Patients may  be screened 
again if they  did not meet spirometry /reversibility  criteria initially . The duration 
between the date of Screen Failure and the re -screening must be >30 days.
g.Femalesof childbearing potential (not surgically  sterile by hysterectomy , bilateral 
salpingectomy , bilateral oophorectom y, or2years postmenopausal) must have 
exclusively  same-sex partners or use medically  acceptable methods of birth control 
andmust agree to continue use of this method for the duration of the stud y and for 5 
months after the last study drug dose. Acceptable methods of birth control include 
intrauterine device, s ystemic hormonal contraceptive (oral, implanted, transdermal, or 
injected), barrier method with spermicide, abstinence, bilateral fallopian tube 
occlusion, and partner vasectomy . 
h.The patient must be willing and able to compl y with study  restrictions, willing and 
able to perform requisite procedures and to remain at the clinic for the required 
duration during the study period, and willing to return to the clinic for the follow-up 
evaluation as specified in this protocol. 
i.Except for the OCS, which will be adjusted per protocol, the patient must maintain 
his/her usual asthma controller regimen without change throughout the screening , 
optimization, run -in, and treatment periods. 
Criteria for Exclusion: Patients will be excluded from participating in this study  if they meet
any of the following criteria:
a.The patient has an y clinically significant, uncontrolled medical condition (treated or 
untreated) that would interfere with the stud y schedule or procedures and 
interpretation of efficacy  results or would compromise the patient’s safet y.
b. The patient has another confounding unde rlying lung disorder (eg, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary  disease, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis [also known as Churg- Strauss sy ndrome], or allergic 
bronchopulmonary  aspergillosis). 
c.The patient has a known hy pereosinophilic sy ndrome.
d.The patient has a history  of any malignancy  within 5 y ears of the screening visit, 
except for treated and cured non- melanoma skin cancers.

Target Biomarker, Immunogenicity, and Pharmacokinetics Measures and Time Points
Target biomarkers: Blood eosinophils will be determined from blood samples collected from 
each patient at DoR/baseline; weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 or earl y withdrawal. Blood 
eosinophils will also be determined from samples collected at the follow -up visit (approximately  
week 32).
Immunogenicity: Serum ADAs will be determined from blood samples collected from each 
patient at DoR/baseline; prior to study  drug administration at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24 or earl y 
withdrawal; and at the follow -up visit (approxi mately week 32). An additional sample will be 
obtained at the late follow- up visit (approximately  week 48).
Pharmacokinetics :Serum reslizumab concentrations will be determined from blood samples 
collected from each patient at DoR/baseline, prior to study  drug administration at weeks 4, 8, 12, 
16, 20, and 24 or earl y withdrawal, and at the follow -upvisit (approximately  week 32). An 
additional PK sample will be obtained at the late follow -up visit (approximately  week48).

Allowed and Disallowed Medications Before and During the Study:
Allowed: 
Inhaled fluticasone propionate at 880μg or equivalent daily  PLUS another 
controller(s) (eg, LABA, LAMA, leukotriene inhibitor, or theophy lline), for at least 6 
months beforethe screening visit. For a fixed-dose ICS/LABA preparation, the

Inhaled reliever medications are allowed as needed for the relief of intermit tent 
asthma sy mptoms.
Prior asthma medications such as ICS, leukotriene pathway  modifiers, long-acting
bronchodilators, and mast cell stabilizers may  be taken concomitantly  and should not 
be altered during this study  unless patient safet y is at risk.
DisallowedDuring the S tudy:
Patients should refrain from using relieverinhalers for 6 hours before any study visit 
that includes spirometry  or airway  reversibility  testing, including the screening visit.
If a patient is taking LABAs, these should be withheld for 12 hours beforeany study 
visit that includes spirometry  or airway  reversibility  testing, including the screening 
visit.
Any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory  agents(biological and non -
biological) , including, but not limited to methotrexate, cyclosporine, and interferon 
(excluding s ystemic corticosteroids prescribed for asthma and maintenance allergen 
immunotherapy )
All biologic therapies, including, but not limited to omalizumab (Xolair®), 
mepolizumab, benralizumab, lebr ikizumab, and anti- tumor necrosis factor 
monoclonal antibodies
All nonbiologic investigational drugs
Inhaled nicotine (including electronic cigarettes)
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size Rationale: The sample size was calculated based on the following assumptions:
Categorical reduction in OCS dose after 24 weeks of treatment will have the 
following distribution for the placebo group: 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
1910.9% of patients will have 90% to 100% reduction
7.9% of patients will have 75% to <90% reduction
14.8% of patients will have 50% to <75% reduction
10.8% of patients will have 0% to <50% reduction
55.6% of patients will have no reduction, loss of asthma control, or 
discontinuation from study  drug
The overall oddsratio between reslizumab and placebo based on proportional odds 
model will be 2.63.
Alpha level of 0.05
Based on the above assumptions, a sample size of 76 patients per group will provide 90% power 
to detect a significant effect of reslizumab over placebo on the probability  for a higher 
categorical reduction of O CS dose.
Analysis of Primary Endpoint: For thisstudy,the primary  endpoint is the categorical reduction 
in OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24, compared with DoR/baseline dose, while maintaining 
asthma control . Five categories of reduction will be defined: 90% to 100% reduction, 75% to 
<90% reduction, 50% to <75% reduction, 0% to <50% reduction, and no decrease in OCS 
dose/loss of asthma control/ discontinuation from study  drug. This categorical endpoint will be 
analyzed using proportional odds model. The model will include the treatment group and 
randomization stratification factors as model factors and the OCS baseline dose and duration of 
historical OCS use (ie, beforescreening )as covariates. The overall odds ratio between 
reslizumab and placebo and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated.
For the primary  analysis, patients who discontinue the study drugearly will be considered as 
nonresponders and will be categori zed in the lowest category  of response.
Sensitivity  analysis will use data collected after early  discontinuation from the study  drug. In this 
analysis, patients will be categorized according to the percent dose reduction at 24 weeks, 
regardless of whether they withdrew earl y from treatment or completed trea tment.
If a patient elects to withdraw (or is discontinued from treatment b y the investigator), every  
attempt will be made to continue the assessments subsequent to his/her withdrawal from the 
study.
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints: All efficacy variables will be summarized by  treatment 
group. For continuous variables, the summary  statistics will include number , mean, standard 
deviation, standard error, median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, patient 
counts and percen tages will be provided. 
Proportion of patients achieving ≥50% reduction in OCS dose at weeks 20 to 24 while 
maintaining asthma control
, proportion of patients achieving dose reduction to ≤5 mg daily  dose 
at weeks 20 to 24 while maintaining asthma control, proportion of patients achieving less than 5 
mg decrement in OCS dose (ie, the minimal and non -responders) at weeks 20 to 24 while 
maintaining asthma control , and proportion of patients discontinuing OCS at weeks 20 to24
while maintaining asthma control will be anal yzed using a logistic regression model. The model 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
20will include the treatment group and randomization stratif ication factors as model factors and the 
OCS baseline dose and duration of historical OCS use (ie, beforescreening )as covariates . 
For the categorical secondary  analysis, patients who discontinue the study  drug earl y will be 
considered as nonresponders and will be categorized in the lowest category  of response
Analysis of the mean percentage change from baseline in OCS dose at weeks 20 to 24 will use an 
analysis of covariance model with treatment group and stratification factors as model factors and 
the OCS baseline dose and duration of historical OCS use (ie, beforescreening )as covariates .
The frequency  of CAEs will use the negative binomial (NB) regression model. The primary  NB 
model will in clude the treatment group and ra ndomization stratification factors as model factors 
and an offset variable. The offset variable will be calculated as the logarithm of follow -up 
duration minus the summed duration of exacerbations. The ratio of CAE rate between the 
treatment groups and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated from the NB model.
Additional covariates or factors may  be added to the statistical models. These will be detailed in 
the statistical analy sis plan.
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity: A fixed sequence multiple testing procedure will be 
implemented to test the primary  and secondary  variables while controlling the overall t ype I error 
rate at 0.05. If the resulting 2-sided p-value from the primary  comparison is ≤0.05, then the next 
comparison of interest (first secondary  variable) will be interp reted inferentially  at 0.05. This 
process will continue through the secondary  variables either until all comparisons of interest are 
interpreted inferentially or until the point at which the resulting 2-sided p-value for a comparison 
of interest is >0.05. At the point where p>0.05, no further comparisons will be interpreted 
inferentially. The hierarchy of end points is as defined in Section 9.5.2 of the protocol. 
No multiplicity  adjustments will be made for other efficacy  and exploratory  efficacy analyses.
Analysis of Other/Exploratory Endpoints: Statistical modeling to be used for other and 
exploratory  efficacy endpoints will be described and detailed in the s tatistical analysis plan.
Safety and PK Analyses: Safet y and PK data will be summarized using descr iptive statistics by  
timepoint and/or treatment group, as appropriate .

331. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
1.1. Introduction 
Asthma is a common chronic lung disorder characterized by  inflammation and narrowing of the 
airways. Symptoms of asthma include cough, breathlessness, and wheezing. The most recent 
estimates suggest that as many asmany as 334million people in the world have asthma (Global 
Asthma Network 2014 ).
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective treatment agents for the long-term control of 
asthma (see EPR-3 2007and GINA 2014 for review). For patients who seasthma is not 
adequatel y controlled on daily  ICS alone, t he addition of long -acting beta - agonists (LABAs ) or 
and/or other controller therapies often provides additional control. There are currently  very few 
options for patients whose asthma is inadeq uately controlled on I CS/LABA. The most severel y 
affected patients with asthma may  require dail y oral corticosteroid (OCS) doses to maintain 
asthma control (GINA 2014).Chronic use of daily  OCSis associated with the severe adverse 
effectsof an iatrogenic Cushing’s s yndrome, including increased risk of infections, impaired 
growth in children, h yperglycemia, low bone density , elevated blood pressure, cataracts, and 
adrenal insufficiency (Walsh et al 2001, Stanbury  and Graham 1998) . Risk can be decreased b y 
maintaining patients on the lowest possible dose of OCS and utilization of cort icosteroid -sparing 
strategies.
Interleukin(IL)-5 is the prototy pic maturation and survival factor for eosinophilic granulocy tes, 
which has been strongly  implicated in asthma pathogenesis ( Wardlaw et al 2000 ).Eosinophils 
are major effector cells involved in the initiation and propagation of diverse inflammatory  
responses. A high blood eosinophil count is a risk factor for increased future asthma 
exacerbations and excessive short -acting beta -agonist (SABA) use after adjustment of potential
confounders in adults with persistent asthma, which suggests a higher disease burden in patients
with asthma and high blood eosinophil counts ( Tran et al 2014 , Zeiger et al 2014 ).
Therapies directed against IL- 5 or its receptor (mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab)
work by reducing eosinophil counts in the circulation and in the airway and have recentl y met a
clinical proof of concept (reduction in asthma exacerbations, improved Asthma Control
Questionnaire [ACQ] scores, or impr oved lung function) in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in
primarily adult populations with asthma and elevated sputum or blood eosinophils (Castro et al 
2011, Haldar et al 2009 , Molfino et al 2012 , Nair et al 2009 , Ortega et al 2014 , Pavord et al 
2012).
Reslizumab is a humanized anti- human IL -5 monoclonal antibody  (mAb) of the 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4/κ isoty pe being de veloped for the treatment of uncontrolled asthma 
in patients withelevated blood eosinophils. Confirmatory  Phase 3 safety  and efficacy  studies for 
administration of reslizumab by  the intravenous (iv) route have concluded the clinical portion; 
results are notable for a significant reduction in clinical asthma exacerbations (CAEs)as well as 
improved lung function. The safety profile accumulated throughout the clinical development of 
reslizumab suggests that reslizumab may  have a favorable benefit -risk profil e in treating patients 
with asthma and elevated blood eosinophils. Therefore, this study  was proposed to further 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
34investigate the potential corticosteroid -reducing properties of reslizumab in patients with 
corticosteroid -dependent asthma and elevated eosino phils.
1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Product
Reslizumab ( CEP38072) is a humanized anti- human interleukin -5 (anti-hIL-5) mAb of the 
immunoglobulin G4/κ isotype being developed for administration by  the iv and subcutaneous 
(sc) routes.
A more detailed description of the product is given in Section 3.11.
1.3. Findings From Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies
A correlation between IL -5–induced eosinophilia and pulmonary  hyperreactivity  was suggested 
by studies in the IL -5 gene knockout mouse (Foster et al 1996). When sensitized and challenged 
with antigen, mice lacking the IL -5 gene failed to develop airway eosinophilia, lung damage, or 
increased lung responsiveness. Otherwise, IL -5 gene knockout mice developed normally  and had 
normal antibody  and cytotoxic T-cell responses.
In vivo, reslizumab showed biological activity in several species, including mouse, guinea pig, 
rabbit, and monkey . Reslizumab inhibited eosinophilia in lungs or skin and reduced airway  
hyperresponsiveness after antigenic challenge in sensitized animals. I nhibition of pulmonary  
eosinophilia was observed for up to 8 weeks post-dose in mice and for up to 6 months in 
monkeys. The effects of reslizumab on eosinophilia in mice were additive with the effects of 
prednisolone.
In single-dose iv toxicity  studies with reslizumab, no adverse effects were observed at the
maximum doses administered (500 mg/kg in mice and rats; 100 mg/kg in monkey s). In
repeat-dose studies, reslizumab was well tolerated by  mice and monkey s given 2 iv doses of 1, 5,
or 25mg/kg reslizumab 14 day s apart; the no -observed- effect level (NOEL) was 5 mg/kg in 
male miceand at least 25 mg/kg in female mice and monkey s. The 6-month studies in mice and 
monkeyswith once -monthly dosing showed no toxicity  and a NOEL of at least 25 mg/kg. The 
NOELfor evidence of reslizumab -related binding to nervous system tissues of monkey s was also 
at least 25 mg/kg. Reslizumab was not genotoxic and did not affect reproductive parameters. In 
safety pharmacology studies, reslizumab had no effect on parameters related to organ function.
Available data indicate that reslizumab may bindto a human brain -specific brain link protein -1, 
which belongs to a superfamily  of structural proteins that help bind cells to matrix by  binding 
hyaluronic acid and negatively  charged gl ycoproteins (Study D-38271).
Nonclinical stu dies in male cy nomolgus mon keys, mice, and rats were performed to assess the 
absolute bioavailability  of reslizumab following single and multiple sc doses. I t was found that 
absolute bioavailability  following sc administration of reslizumab was high (>75%) in all 
species. Subcutaneo us administration of reslizumab in these studies was well tolerated. Mild, 
focal, intramuscular (im)macrophage infiltrates were found at the injection site in 1 monkey  
dosed with sc reslizumab. I n addition, an acute sc irritation study  in rats found that sc 
administration of reslizumab produced minimal to mild gross local tissue irritation. Following sc 
administration in nonclinical studies, approximately  20% to 50% of animals tested positive for 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
35anti-reslizumab antibodies. The antibody response correlated with decreased serum 
concentrations in some, but not all, of these animals. 
Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
1.3.2. Clinical Studies
The pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacod ynamics (PD), immunogenicit y, and safet y ofiv 
reslizumab over the dose range of 0.03 mg/kg through 3 mg/kg have been characterized in 
14studies in patients and in healthy  subjects. 
1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies
The PK of reslizumab aresimilarfollowing iv administration in patients and in healthy  subjects. 
Following iv administration, maximum serum reslizumab concentrations (C max) are typically 
attained at the end of the infusion and generally  decline from peak in a biphasic manner. Mean 
terminal half-life (t½) of reslizumab following multiple dose administration is approximately  
24days, resulting in an accumulation ratio of approximately  1.5-to 1.9-fold when administered 
every 4 weeks. S ystemic exposure, as assessed b y Cmaxand area under th e concentration curve 
(AUC), increases in an apparentl y dose proportional manner over the dose range of 0.3 mg/kg 
through 3.0 mg/kg.
Following a single sc dose, bioavailability  of reslizumab is approximately  67%. Peak serum 
reslizumab concentrations are t ypically observed approximately  7 days after sc administration. 
As expected, the remainder of the PK profile following sc administration is qualitatively  similar 
to that observed following iv administration and exhibits a biphasic decline from peak with a 
long terminal t ½(approximately  26 days). 
Reslizumab has a small volume of distribution (V d, approximately  5 L), suggesting minimal 
distribution to extravascular tissues. Based on the characteristics of reslizumab, renal or hepatic 
impairment and use of co ncomitant medications is unlikely  to affect s ystemic exposure to 
reslizumab. The lack of effect of mild or moderate renal impairment or Grade 1/2 elevations in 
liver function tests on the PK of reslizumab was confirmed in population PK (PPK) anal yses in 
asthma patients. In vitro data indicate that IL -5 and reslizumab are unlikel y to affect cy tochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzy mes commonly  implicated in drug -drug interactions and the results of the PPK 
analyses confirmed that concomitant use of leukotriene antagonists or systemic corticosteroid 
classes, as well as the individual drugs prednisone and montelukast, did not impact sy stemic 
exposure to reslizumab.
Other than a stud y performed to compare the PK, PD, and immunogenicity of reslizumab in 
Japanese and non- Japanese subjects, there were no dedicated studies for the assessment of the 
effect of demographic characteristics on the PK of reslizumab. Results of PPK analy ses 
demonstrated that age, sex, and race (Caucasian, Black, Asian, ‘other’) have no notable impact 
on the PK of reslizumab ;however,body weight was found to impact exposure. The PPK 
analyses also demonstrated no clear indication of reduced exposure to reslizumab in patients who 
developed antibodies to reslizumab (ie, were anti -drug antibody  [ADA] positive) .
Further details may be found in the current IB.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
361.3.2.2. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies
The Phase 3 BREATH program in adults and adolescent swith asthma evaluated the safet y and 
efficacy of reslizumab administered iv every 4 weeks at 3 mg/kg (16-week StudiesC38072/3081 
and C38072/3084, 12-month Studies C38072/3082 and C38072/3083, and open- label safet y 
extension Study  C38072/3085) and 0.3 mg/kg (Study  3081 onl y). A significant reduction in the 
annual rate of asthma exacerbations and significant improv ements in lung function, 
asthma-related quality  of life, and patient-reported measures of asthma control (ACQ and 
Asthma Symptom Utility  Index) were observed in patients with eosinophilic asthma defined b y a 
screening blood eosinophil count of ≥400/µL (Studies 3081, 3082, and 3083).
In patients with asthma but without elevated blood eosinophils (Study  3084), reslizumab 
produced nonsignificant improvements in lung function and other measures of efficacy . In 
contrast,in patients with blood eosinophil levels ≥400/L, reslizumab produced significant 
improvements in lung function and other measures of efficacy.
A total of 2195 healthy volunteers and patients with moderate to severe asthma, eosinophilic 
esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis, h ypereosinophilic syndr ome, or nasal poly posis had received 
at least 1 dose of reslizumab in 14 clinical studies.
The safety of reslizumab was evaluated in adults and in children in clinical studies summarized 
in the current IB. Single or multiple doses of iv reslizumab from 0.03 through 3.0 mg/kg were 
well tolerated ,with a common adverse event profile similar to placebo. The majority  of adverse 
events were generall y mild to moderate in severit y, and most adverse events were assessed as 
unrelated to stud y drug, as determined b y the investigator. Overall, the nature and occurrence of 
the reported stud y drug-related adverse events did not raise an y specific safety  concerns.
The following summary  relates to integrated adverse events data of the 5 asthma 
placebo-controlled completed studies (ie, Studies Res-5- 0010, 3081, 3082, 3083, and 3084) that 
include the 3 mg/kg iv dose and every  4 weeks dosing regimen (up to 52 weeks). Serious adverse 
events and death cases from the open -label Study 3085 are also included in the relevant sections.
Common Adverse Events
The most common preferred terms (reported in >5% of patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg 
group) were asthma (232 [23%] and 289 [40%] patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo 
groups, respectively ), nasophary ngitis (103 [10%]and 103[14%]patients, respectivel y), upper 
respiratory  tract infection (96 [9%] and 69 [10%]patients, respectivel y), headache (78 [8%] and 
62[9%]patients, respectively), and sinusitis (57[6%] and 51 [7%]patients, respectivel y). There 
were no advers e events in the reslizumab -treated group that had an incidence higher than the 
placebo group b y at least 1%. 
Serious Adverse Events
The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group 
(6%) compared with the placebo treatment group (9%). The serious adverse event reported with 
the highest incidence was asthma (preferred terms of asthma, asthma crisis, and status 
asthmaticus), reported b y 24 (3%) patients in the placebo group and 24 (2%) patients in the 
reslizumab 3.0mg/kg group.

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
37Deaths
There were 4 deaths in the clinical development plan: 1 death occurred in a placebo -treated 
patient and 3 deaths occurred in the ongoing open -label study  (Study C38072/3085). None of the 
deaths were considered related to reslizumab .
Laboratory Findings
No clinically  meaningful changes in clinical laboratory  values, vital signs measurements, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), or phy sical examination findings were noted in the completed studies 
with the exception of a decrease in eosinophil cou nts in the reslizumab groups, which was dose
related and is expected in view of the mechanism of action o freslizumab. Smalldecreases in the 
mean value sof total white blood cell counts werealso observed in some studies and have been 
assessed as reflecting the decrease in the eosinophil component of the differential cell count s. 
The mean values of eosinophil and white blood cell counts returned to baseline values at the end 
of study follow-up visit (4 months after the last dose of reslizumab).
Adverse Dru g Reactions
Anaphylaxis related to reslizumab inf usion has been reported and is considered an adverse drug 
reaction (ADR ). All cases of anaph ylaxis early in the drug development occurred in the 
eosinophilic esophagitis studies and were deemed by the investigator as related to known food 
allergies and not to reslizumab. T hreeinfusion-related reactions, reported as anaph ylaxis,
occurred during or shortly after reslizumab infusion in the BREATH studies and were 
characterized variously  by skin or mucosal involvement, dy spnea, wheezing, gastrointestinal 
symptoms,and chills. The 3 events were treated at the study site, and patients were withdrawn
from the study .
Myalgia (without evidence for muscle injury ) was reported at a slightl y higher ratein the 
reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group (1%) than in the placebo group (0.5%) and is considered an ADRof 
reslizumab. 
Additional Safety Considerations
Malignancy risk
As of February  2015, there were 27 treatment -emergent adverse events reported by  24patients 
related to malignancy  for the entire clinical program, including placebo -treated patients . 
Malignancies in reslizumab -treated patients were of diverse tissues (colon, anal, 
melanoma, prostate,breast, lung, plasmacy toma, lymphoma, lung metastasis of a previous 
resected colon cancer, ovarian adenocarcinoma, borderline ovarian tumor ,andnonmelanoma 
skin cancer cases). 
In the asthma placebo -controlled studies utilizing the 3.0 -mg/kg dose , incidence of overall 
malignancies was 6 patients (0.58%; 1 patient had both prostate cancer and skin squamous cell 
carcinoma) in the reslizumab 3.0 -mg/kg treatment group and 2 patients (0.27%) in the placebo 
group. All malignancies in reslizumab- treated patients were diagnosed within less than 6 months 
from first reslizumab dosing, except for the skin squamous cell carcinoma. 
In the combined placebo -controlled studies and long -term, open- label, safety  extension 
StudyC38072/3085, malignancies were reported in 21 patients. These included 5 cases of 
non-melanoma skin cancer. Most malignancies were diagnosed within less than 6 months after 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
38starting reslizumab treatment, and in 5 cases, there was a previous medical history  of 
malignancy . 
A thorough anal ysis of malignancy  cases did not suggest a causal rela tionship between 
reslizumab and cancer risk.
Infections
The immune response to parasitic infections may  involve eosinophils; therefore, the clinical 
course of existing or new parasitic infections could potentially  be complicated by  a mechanism 
of action th at lowers blood and tissue eosinophils. The iv reslizumab clinical protocols contained 
an exclusion criterion for patients with active or suspected helminth infestation/infection. The 
asthma Phase 3 studies were conducted in geographic regions in which hel minth infections are 
prevalent, including South and Central America, Africa, and Asia. There were no helminth 
infections reported, and no difference was documented between the treatment groups in regards 
to adverse events that could be associated with gast rointestinal helminth infections.
The overall rate of infection adverse events was lower for reslizumab versus placebo -treated 
patients, with the ty pes of infection events reported consistent with what would be expected in a 
primarily adult patient populat ion with an underly ing condition of asthma. No potential 
opportunistic infections were reported.
Pregnancy
The safety of reslizumab in pregnant women or developing fetus has not been studied, but 
nonclinical and clinical studies raised no specific concerns . As of December 2015 , there have 
been 10pregnancies during the entire clinical development of reslizumab, 2 of which occurred 
during the screening period of the study  and 8 in patients receiving reslizumab. All patients were 
withdrawn from the study. Two pregnancies were terminated by  an elective abortion with no 
complications, and 5 led to the birth of full-term infants with no malformations and no obstetric 
or perinatal complications. One male newborn had a neonatal jaundice that was reported as an 
unrelated adverse event and was assessed as ph ysiological jaundice. One pregnancy  case was lost 
to follow-up, and the outcome is unknown.
Immunogenicity
Anti-drugantibody responses were observed in 3.3% to 11.8% of patients in the completed 
Phase 3 studies in patients with asthma (iv administration every  4 weeks, >1000 patients 
evaluated for ADA). In general, the ADA responses were low in titer and often transient, and 
were not associated with an effect on reslizumab concentration, eosinophil count ,or specific 
clinical manifestations (including h ypersensitivity reactions).
Furtherdetails may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure .
1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Patients
Information regarding risks and benefits of reslizumab to human patients may  be found in the 
current IB.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
391.4.1. Risks of Reslizumab
Most clinical safet y data for reslizumab arebased on the experience with iv administration of the 
drug. As described in Section 1.3.2, iv reslizumab has been generally  welltolerated over the 
range of doses evaluated (ie, from 0.03 through 3 mg/kg). S ystemic severe reactions (including 
anaphylaxis) and my algia are considered ADRs of iv reslizumab. 
There arelimited safety  data regarding scadministration of reslizumab .In StudyC38072/1107 
(Study 1107), 45 healthy  volunteers received a single 220 -mg sc injection of reslizumab. All 
adverse events were mild to moderate in severity . There were no deaths, serious adverse events, 
treatment -related adverse events, or withdrawals du e to adverse events reported in this study .
1.4.2. Benefits of Reslizumab
As described in Section 1.3.2, results from clinical studies indicate improved asthma control and
forced expiratory  volume in 1 second ( FEV1)and a medicall y meaningful decreased rate of 
CAEswith reslizumab.
A reduction in OCS dose in OCS -dependent asthma with elevated eosinophils has been reported 
for the related anti -IL-5 investigational product, mepolizumab ( Bel et al 2014 ), and is theorized 
to be a potential class effect .Additionally , the effect of reslizumab was pronounced in patients 
with severe asthma who were on OCS ( Castro et al 2015 ).
In Studies Res -5-0010, 3081, 3082, 3083, and 3084 , certain therapeutic classes of medications 
were used more frequently in the placeb o group than in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment 
group. These included antibacterials for s ystemic use (270 [26%]patients in the reslizumab 
3.0 mg/kg treatment group and 290 [40%]patients in the placebo group), antihistamines for 
systemic use (375 [36%]patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group and 
321[44%]patients in the placebo group), corticosteroids for s ystemic use (246[24%] patients in 
the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group and 288 [39%]patients in the placebo group), and 
nasal preparations (325 [32%]patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group and 
268[37%]patients in the placebo group). These imbalances in concomitant medication use most 
likely reflect the substantial benefits that reslizumab treatment provided in impro ving respiratory  
symptoms, resulting in less need for additional treatment in the reslizumab group.
1.4.3. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for This Study
Improvement in lung fu nction has been confirmed in 3 Phase 3 clinical studies with the iv dosage 
form. Inaddition to improved lung function, a significant reduction in CAEs over 52 weeks was 
observed in patients with moderate to severe asthma and elevated blood eosinophils in 2 Phase 3 
clinical studies.Modeling and simulation data demonstrate that steady-state trough serum 
concentrations of reslizumab following administration of the proposed 110 -mg sc dosing 
regimen are expected to fall within the range of exposures that produced meaningful effects on 
both blood eosinophils and FEV 1 in patients with eosinophilic asthma. Therefore, a fixed dose of 
110 mg sc once every 4 weeks is anticipated to provide sufficient efficacy .
In completed studies, reslizumab was generally well tolerated over the dose range 0.03 through 
3.0mg/kg. The majorit y of adverse e vents in reslizumab -treated patients were mild to moderate 
in severity ;considered to be unrelated to stud y drug treatment, as determined by the investigator ;
and, (as expected )associated with underl ying asthma disease. There were no significant 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
40differences in the adverse event profile between patients treated with reslizumab and patients 
treated with placebo, with the exception of the ADRs “systemic severe reactions (including 
anaphylaxis)”and “myalgia.”Three anaphy laxis reactions related to reslizumab infusions were 
reported during the BREATH asthma program; none of the patients were positive for ADA . All 
cases resolved with standard treatment, and treatment with reslizumab was permanentl y 
discontinued. Myalgia (without evidence for muscle injury ) was reported at a slightly  higherrate
in the reslizumab 3.0-mg/kg group (1%) than in the placebo group (0.5%). The protocol includes 
measures to closel y monitor and promptly  address these ADRs to mitigate any potential harm to 
patients. 
Consideration of the accumulated data on the clinical effects of reslizumab in patients with 
asthma suggests that patients with elevated blood eosinophils benefit the most from anti -human 
IL-5 therapy . The safet y profile accumulated throughout the clinical development of resli zumab 
suggests that reslizumab would have a favorable benefit- risk profile in treating patients with 
asthma and elevated blood eosinophils whose sy mptoms remain inadequately  controlled on 
standard-of-care asthma therap y.
1.5. Selection of Drugs and Dosages 
1.5.1. Justification for Dosage of Active Drug
The platform of evidence that supports the range of the reslizumab dose response is based on the 
observed effects on lung function and other clinical endpoints in patients with eosinophilic
asthma (Studies P00290 [0.3 -and 1-mg/kg doses], Res-5- 0010 [3-mg/kg dose], and 3081 [0.3-
and 3-mg/kg doses]), on eosinophil depletion in the blood in healthy  subjects (Study  1102[0.3-, 
1-, 2-, and 3-mg/kg doses]) , and in the blood and affected tissue in patients with asthma
(StudiesI96-350, 3081, and P00290) and eosinophilic esophagitis (Study  Res-5-0002 [1-, 2-, and
3-mg/kg doses]). R efer to the IBfor summary  and comprehensive presentation of these data. 
Briefly, treatment with iv reslizumab at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg produced substa ntiallysmaller and 
less durable reductions in the number of blood or tissue eosinophils (ie, sputum) than
doses≥1 mg/kg. In contrast, the magnitude of reductions in blood or tissue eosinophils at doses
≥1 mg/kg (ie, 1, 2, or 3 mg/kg) was similar. Improvements in patients in the reslizumab
0.3-mg/kg treatment group for FEV 1 were 0.129 L at week 16 (p=0.0481), but other efficacy
endpoint results were more variable (eg, no treatment effect on forced vital capacity  (FVC)and 
forced expiratory flow at 25% and 75% of the FVC ( FEF25%-75%)wasobserved for patients in the 
reslizumab 0.3-mg/kg treatment group). Therefore, ivdoses of≥1mg/kg are anticipated to be 
clinically effective in most patients. Based on these clinical and eosinophil PD data, Teva h as 
chosen reslizumab 110 mg administered once every4 weeks as the fixed dose to study  in the sc 
program. This approximates a 1-mg/kg iv dose for the average patient (ie, 70 kg) when adjusted 
to account for sc bioavailability  (ie,67%). Modeling and simula tion demonstrate that steady -
statetrough serum concentrations of reslizumab following adm inistration of the proposed 
110mg scdosing regimen are expected to fall within the range of exposures that produced 
meaningful effects on both blood eosinophils and FEV1 in patients with eosinophilic asthma. 
Therefore, a fixed dose of 110 mg sc once every 4 weeks is anticipated to provide sufficient 
efficacy.

473. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. General Design and Study Schema
This is a Phase 3, 24- week,double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel -groupstudy to evaluate the 
efficacy and safet y of sc reslizumab treatment at a dosageof 110mgevery 4 weeksin patients 
12years of age and older with OCS -dependent asthma and elevated blood eosinophils . The study  
will consistof a screening period of up to 2 weeks , followed b y an optimization period of up to 
10weeks, a run-in period of at least 2 weeks, a 24 -weekdouble-blind treatment period, an
8-weekfollow-up period, and an additional 16- week follow -up period to collect drug wash- out 
samples for immunogenicity assessments. The patient may  delay the early and/or late follow -up 
visits if the patient enrolls in an open- label,long-term safetystudy after end of treatment, if 
available. 
3.1.1. Screening Period
Patients will begin screening up to 14 weeks beforeDoR. During the screening period, a signed 
and dated informed consent form (ICF) (and an assent form for children 12 through <18 years of 
age in accordance with local standards) will be obtained before a diagnosis of asthma is 
confirmed on the basis of patient history  and by demonstration of airway  reversibility . The 
patients will also be asked about their asthma medication compliance and to demonstrate their 
inhaler use technique. If the inhaler use techn ique is not optimal, patients will be taught the 
appropriate inhaler use technique during the screening period and should be reassessed before
run-in. The patient will also have a complete blood count (CBC) determined. If the patient’s 
eosinophil count is 300/μL or greater while on daily  OCSand if the patient’s medication 
compliance and inhaler use technique are optimal, the patient will be eligible to continue . Note: a 
patient will meet inclusion criteria if an eosinophil count of 30 0/μL or greater becomes manifest 
during the OCS optimization period or at the w eek -2 visit(end of optimization period/beginning 
of run-in period) . Patient medical history ;pre-bronchodilator spirometry ; 12-lead ECG ; physical 
examination; urinalysis;vital signs measurem ents;beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG) 
serum pregnancy  test (for all females of childbearing potential); testing for human 
immunodeficiency  virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C (HCV); and concomitant medication 
history will also be assessed at screening.
To be eligible to enroll in the study , a patient will have an airway  FEV1reversibility  of at least 
12% to beta -agonist administration, a blood eosinophil count of at least 300/μLwhile on dail y 
OCSor during the OCS optimization period or at the week -2 visit or a documented blood 
eosinophil level of at least 300/μL during the previous 12 months while on at least medium dose 
ICS, a current fluticasone propionate dosage of at least 880 μg daily  or equivalent plus another 
controller, and will ha ve met all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.
3.1.2. Optimization Period
Patients who meet screening eligibility  requirements will enter the optimization period for up to 
10 weeks to determine the patient’s minimal effective OCS requirement. The pa tient’s previous 
OCS will be standardized to an equivalent dose and regimen of prednisone to facilitate 
optimization; the same formulation should be maintained through the end of treatment ( EOT)
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
48visit. It is expected that the optimization period will be shorter than 10 weeks for those patients 
who are at or near their optimal corticosteroid dose at enrollment. The patient ’s previous non -
OCS background asthma controller medications will be continued uncha nged throughout the 
pre-randomization period and the entire stud y. At the beginning of the optimization period ,an 
asthma sy mptom diary  and electronic peak flow meter will be distributed where the patient will 
record asthma s ymptoms, number of reliever bronchodilator inhalations, nighttime awakenings 
due to asthma requiring rescue inhaler , and AM and PM PEF.
For optimization, the prednisone dose should be reduced at 1- week intervals, according to the 
algorithm shown in Table 1, for up to 10 weeks, or until there is a worsening of asthma signs and 
symptoms. Worsening of asthma signs and s ymptoms should be based on the following:
FEV1 <80% of the screening value AND/OR
The physician’s global assessment of asthma worsening based on trends in daily  diary 
measures for the past 7 day s compared with the week prior, as well as an y physical 
examination signs
When either a lung function or a symptomatic deterioration occurs, the patient will be returned to 
the previously effective OCS level, which will then constitute the minimally  effective dose for 
the purpose of run -in.If this previously  effective dose is no longer effective, the investigator can 
determine the clinically  appropriate minimally  effective dose for the purpose of run- in.
Regarding the amount and rate of OCS reduction during dose optimization , in order to provoke a 
worsening of asthma signs and sy mptomswithin the 10- week, monitored optimization period, 
OCS reduction should be attempted approximately every  1 weekafter evaluation in the clinic. 
The magnitude of OCS reduction will be based on the following Optimization Phase OCS Dose 
Reduction Algorithm ( Table1).

aStarting doses that fallbetween values shown in this table should utilize the algorithm for the higher of the 2
doses.
bPatients who the investigator believes may be able to decrease OCS dose to 40 mg during the optimization period 
may be enrolled. OCS dose reduction during optimization for patients on >40 mg daily at that start of optimization 
should follow weekly reductions with m agnitudes similar to those in the table ( this maybe discussed with medical 
monitor). Patients who require >40 mg OCS to maintain asthma control at the end of optimization will not be 
randomized.
cPatients must be using an average daily dose of ≥5 mg OCS after optimization. Patients who require <5 mg OCS 
to maintain asthma control will not be randomized.
OCS=oral corticosteroid
Regarding eosinophil counts during the optimization period, b lood eosinophil s≥300/μLthat 
become manifest during OCS reductions during optimization, will count toward the eosinophil 
inclusion criterion for this study .
3.1.3. Run-In Period
Patients whose minimal effective OCS dose remains between ≥5 mg and ≤ 40 mg of prednisone
daily at the end of optimization may  advance to run -in (for at least 2 weeks). During run -in, 
patients will continue to keep their dail y asthma control diary and a PEF meter to perform dail y 
self-monitoring of asthma sy mptoms while maintaining their minimally  effective OCS dose and 
previous background asthma medications unchanged. The frequency  of symptoms, use of 
inhaled reliever bronchodilator, nighttime awakenings due to asthma requiring rescue inhaler, 
and ambulatory  lung function during the last 7 day s of run-in will constitute the baseline level of 
control for analy sis and the basis for OCS reduction algorithm to be used during the treatment 
period. 
3.1.4. Treatment Period
Patients continuing to meet eligibility  criteria on the day  of randomization (day  1, week0)will 
be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo or reslizumab 110 mgonce every  4 weeks 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
50through week 20, followed by  an EOT visit at week 24 . Patients will begin treatment on day  1 
after completing baseline assessments, and they  will return to the research facility  for outpatient 
visits every  4 weeks through week24 (EOT visit) for safety , PK, PD, immunogenicity , and 
efficacy assessments as applicable. 
During the treatment period ,the patient will continue his/her usual non -OCS background asthma 
medication without change; the OCS dose will be tapered per protocol. The treatment periods 
consist of the following:
Induction : The minimally effective dose of OCS will be maintained, unchanged, 
during the first 4 weeks of the treatment period to allow sufficient time for any  
potential treatment effect to become established.
OCS reduction : The minimally  effective OCS dose will be reduced per protocol at 
scheduled clinic visits from the beginning of week 5 (ie, end of the induction period) 
through week 2 0, as long as all 5 criteria in Table2are met and there are no clinical 
manifestations of adrenal insufficiency .These 5 eligibility  criteria assure that the 
patient's asthma control is not significantl y worsened compared to base line. The last 
possible dose reduction can occur at week 20. The algorithm for OCS reductions 
during the treatment period is given in Table3.
If the OCS dose could not be decreased, it should be held constant, or may  be 
increased to a previous level, at the investigator’s discretion, until dose reduction 
criteria are met.
Maintenance: OCS will be held stable from week 20 through EOT at week 24.

3.1.4.1. Handling of Asthma Exacerbations During the Treatment Period
Patients should be treated with an OCS burst: 40 to 60 mg (or at least double the current dose) of 
OCS tapered over a 7 -to 10-day period to a new maintenance dose of 2.5 mg above the pre-burst 
dose. It is understood that im or ivcorticosteroid may also be administered as part of the 
treatment of the asth ma exacerbation. If a second OCS burst (doubling of current dose) is 
required, the patient should be maintained on a fixed OCS dose without any tapering attempts for 
the remainder of th e double-blind treatment phase and the follow -up period.
Patients who c omplete all scheduled visits will have final procedures and assessments performed 
at the EOTvisit(visit 19). Patients who withdraw from the study  before completing the 24-week
treatment period will have visit 19 (week24 ±7 daysor early termination) pro cedures and 
assessments performed at their final visit. Patients will return for a follow -up evaluation 8 weeks
(±7 days)after the EOTvisit in this study for assessment of pre -bronchodilator spirometry , 
ACQ-6score, PK samples, adverse events, blood eosinophils, CAEsand related health care 
utilizations, and blood for AD A.
The assessments and procedures performed during each stud y visit are detailed in Table5and 
Section3.16.If a patient elects to withdraw (or is discontinued from treatment by the 
investigator), every  attempt will be made to continue the assessments subsequent to his/her 
withdrawal from the study (see Section4.5).

A description of the safety  measures is provided in Section 6.15.
3.9. Randomization and Blinding
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study . In order to achieve balance 
between treatment groups with regard to average daily  OCS use/ requirement and age, 
randomization w ill be stratified by optimized, average dail y OCS dose of >10 mgor ≤10 mgand 
age (12 to <18 years of age or ≥ 18 years of age) at baseline . Within each stratum, patients will be 
randomly  assigned to receive treatment with sc reslizumab at a dosageof 110mgevery 4 weeks
or a matching placebo in a 1 :1ratio.This system is used to ensure a b alance across treatment 
groups.
The randomization list and treatment will be assigned to the relevant treatment groups through a 
qualified contract research organization ( CRO), eg, via Interactive Web Response Sy stem 
(IWRS). Generation of the medication list and management of the interactive response 
technology  (IRT)system will be done by a qualified CROunder the oversight of Teva’s Clinica l 
Supply Chain.
The sponsor’s personnel involved in the study  will also be blinded to the study  drug identity  after 
the run-in period until the database is locked for analy sis and the treatment assignment is 
revealed, with the exception of the bioanal ytical group (Global Bioassay s and Technology ), who, 
in order to facilitate PK and ADA sample ana lysis, will not be blin ded. Eosinophils and 
monocytes will be redacted from the post -baseline differential cell count reports to avoid the 
possibility of removing the blind.
3.10. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding
3.10.1. Randomization
Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a restricted access area within Teva Global
Biometrics or in a secure manner with the vendor contracted to create the randomization list.At 
the time of anal ysis, when treatment codes are needed, the Teva statistician assigned to the stud y 
will make a request to unblind and will receive the unblinded codes.
3.10.2. Blinding/Unblinding
In order to complete the data analysis forPK, it may  be necessary to assay samples before 
database lock. If so, the individuals responsible for sample anal ysis will know which patients 
received study  drug and which patients received placebo. The randomization codes will be 
provided to personnel responsible for bioanal ysis according to a process that will be predefined 
in the unblinding plan form (GBP_RD_703_FRM_02) according to Teva Standard O perating 
Procedure ( SOP)GBP_RD_703. The form will be signed at the stud y initiation stage b y the 
responsible Teva statistician, C ROstatistician , and randomization code generator. After 
authorization has been obtained to release the codes, the randomization code generator at the 
CROwill provide the codes directl y to the bioanalysis team; the statisticians (at Teva and the 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
57CRO) will not be unblinded. Personnel responsible for bioanal ysis will not have access to 
clinical safety and efficacy data and will provide concentration data to an y other personnel who 
may require it in a manner that will not identify  individual patients (i e, a dummy  patient 
identifier will be linked to an individual patient’s concentration data). 
For information about personnel who may  be aware of treatment assignments, see Section 3.9. 
These individuals will not be involved in conduct of any  study procedures or assessment of any  
adverse events, safety
,or efficacy  data.
In case of a serious adverse event or pregnancy , in which knowledge of the study  drug 
assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may  unblind the patient’s 
drug assignment as deemed necessary , mainly in emergency situations. Individual treatment 
codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomly -assigned patient, will be 
available to the investigator(s) and/or pharmacist(s) at the study  center via the I RT, both via 
telephone and internet. If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the event before breaking of 
the code. If this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately afterward, and the 
patient’s drug code assignment should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code can 
always be performed by  the site without prior approval by  the sponsor.
When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the study , and the event will be 
recorded onto the case report form (CRF). The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code 
should be fully  documented in the investigator’s study  files and in the patient’s source 
documentation. Treatment assignment should not be recorded in an y study documents or source 
document.
In blinded studies, for adverse events that are defined as suspected, 
unexpected, seriousadverse 
reaction (SUSAR ; ie, reasonable possibility ; seeSection7.1.4), the Global Patient Safety  and 
Pharmacovigilance department may independently request that the treatment code be revealed 
(on a case -by-case basis) to comply  with regulatory  requirements. The report will be provided in 
an unblinded manner for regulatory  submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for 
other personnel (eg , the investigator , Teva medical monitor, and study  personnel ) and the patient 
will not be withdrawn from the study .
In order to maintain the blinding in this study , each patient will receive either one 1.0 -mL sc 
injection containing 110 mg of reslizumab or one 1.0 -mL injection containing sterile placebo 
solution on each dosing day . Both reslizumab and placebo will be provided as clear solutions.
3.11. Drugs Used in the Study
A description of administration procedures is given in Section5.1.
Additional details may  also be found in the current version of the IBfor reslizumab. 
3.11.1. Investigational Product
Reslizumab will be provided as a sterile solution containing 110mg (1.0mL) reslizumab per 
syringe, formulated at 11
0 mg/mL in  sodium acetate, with  sucrose,  
polysorbate 80, pH 5.5 buffer. The needle shields of the prefilled s yringes contain natural rubber 
latex. Both reslizumab and placebo will be provided as clear solutions.

Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
58Reslizumab will be administered sc in a dosage of 110 mg (1.0 mL) every  4 weeks, depending 
on treatment assignment. A more detailed description of administration procedures is given in 
Section5.1. 
3.11.2. Placebo
Placebo will be provided as a sterile solution containing  sodium acetate, with  
sucrose, 
 polysorbate 80, pH 5.5 buffer , presented as 1. 0-mLper syringe.The needle 
shields of the prefilled s yringes contain natural rubber latex.
Placebo will be administered as a sc injection. Each patient will receive a placebo dose of 1.0mL
injectedsc, depending on treatment assignment.
A more detailed description of administration procedures is given in Section 5.1.
3.12. Drug Supply and Accountability
3.12.1. Drug Storage and Security
Reslizumab and matching placebo must be stored in a refrigerator at controlled temperature (2°C 
to 8°C), should not be frozen, and should be protected from light. Reslizumab and placebo will 
be kept in a secure area (eg, locked refrigerator). 
The site should have a process for monitoring 
the storage temperature of unused study  drug.
3.12.2. Drug Accountability
Each study drug shipment will include a packing slip, listing of the contents of the shipment, and 
drug return instructions and any  applicable forms.
Eachinvestigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of study  drug and other study  
materials from the sponsor are correctl y received and recorded, handled and stored safel y and 
properly in accordance with the CFR or local regulations , and used in acco rdance with this 
protocol. 
A record of stud y drug accountability (ie, study drug and other materials received, used, retained, 
returned, or destro yed) must be prepared and signed by  the principal investigator or designee, 
with an account given for any  discrepancies. Empty , partially  used, and unused study  drug will 
be disposed of or returned to the sponsor’s designee.
3.13. Duration of Patient Participation and Justification
The study is expected to last up to 62weeks and will consist of a screening period of up to 
2weeks, an optimization period of up to 10 weeks, a run- in period of at least 2 weekson the 
optimized OCS dose , followed b y a 24-weekdouble-blind treatment period , an
8-weekfollow-up 
period.
It is expected that the optimization period will be shor ter than 10 weeks for those patients 
who are at or near their optimal corticosteroid dose at enrollment.
An additional, late follow- up for immunogenicity  testing will be performed 28 weeks after the 
last dose of study  drug.See Section 12.4for the definition of the end of the study .The patient 
may delay the early and/or late follow -up visits if the patient enrolls in an open -label long -term 
safetystudy after end of treatment, if available.

Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
593.14. Stopping Rules and Discontinuation Criteria
Other than pregnancy , there are no formal rules for study  drug discontinuation in this study . 
During the conduct of the study , serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest 
will be reviewed by the sponsor (seeSection7.1.6) as they are reported from the investigational 
centerto identify  safety concerns. The study may be terminated b y the sponsor at an y timefor 
reasons including, but not limited to a safety  concern.
A patient may  discontinue participation in the study at an y time for an y reason (eg, lack of 
efficacy, consent withdrawn, adverse event) . 
The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a patient from the study  for reasons including, but 
not limited to, a change in the medical condition or an adverse event that alters the patient’s 
benefit/risk (eg, pregnancy ,a related severe h ypersensitivity  reaction,or related severe 
myalgia/muscle event ), a protocol violation or deviation as defined in Section11.1.2, or 
noncompliance.
3.15. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form
All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medi cal records, or 
equivalent, before they are transcribed onto the CRF . 
Data may  not be recorded directly  onto the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor 
provides written instructions specifying which data are permitted to be recorded directly onto the 
CRF.
If data are processed from other institutions (eg, clinical laboratory , central image center, 
electronic diary [eDiary]data), the results will be sent to the investigational center, where they  
will be retained but not entered into the CRF u nless otherwise noted in the protocol . These data 
may also be sent electronically  to the sponsor (or organization performing data management) for 
direct entry  into the clinical database (see Section13.1). All data from other institutions will be 
available to the investigator.
The CRFs are filed in the sponsor’s central file .

aThe site will contact IWRS at every optimization and treatment visit.
bThe patient’s previous OCS should be switched to an equivalent , standardized prednisone formulation. Optimization may occur once OCS standardization is complete.
cAttempts at OCS reduction should be made at 1 -week intervals, for up to 10 weeks or until the re is a worsening of asthma signs and symptoms, to help determine the patient’s 
lowest effective OCS dose. This period may be shortened if the lowest effective dose is achieved sooner. Eosinophil counts du ring the optimization period or at the week -2 visi t 
may be considered in order to meet the eosinophil inclusion criteria for this study. Patients requiring an average daily dose of between ≥5 mg and ≤40 mg may proceed to run-in 
and maintained without change during run -in.
dThe screening period (between V1 and V2) can be less than 2 weeks if all of the screening inclusion criteria are met sooner. It is understood that not all procedures can be 
completed on the same day. In particular, the patient may need to return to satisfy the medication hold for screening pre bronchodilator FEV1 and reversibility testing.

Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-30027
63eVerify that essential screening inclusion criteria for asthma are met before entering optimization.
fReversibility testing is most conveniently performed at the same visit as the screening, pre-bronchodilator spirometry. All patients must undergo reversibility testing, e ven if they 
are submitting historical reversibility or methacholine provocation results to support inclusion criterion e. Reversibility t esting may be repeated once, within the 2-week 
screening period.
gβHCG serum pregnancy tests will be performed at screening; urine pregnancy testing will be performed every 4 weeks thereafter until week 24 or early withdrawal (female 
patients who are not 2 years postmenopausal or surgically sterile) and at the early follow -up visit (V20).
hThe patient must have had a blood eosinophil count ≥300/μL in the 12 months before ICF or ≥300/μL during screening or during OCS optimization or at the week -2 visit. A 
CBC with differential need not be repeated at every visit during the optimization period and should be done at the investigat or's discretion if the eosinophil criteria were not met 
at screening.
iCPK is collected with serum chemistry tests at scheduled visits. If a potentially clinically significant CPK level (≥3.1 × UL N) is reported, initiate the CPK/myalgia CRF and 
clinical monitoring as outlined in Protocol Section 7.1.7.3.2.
jCPK measurement only. CPK will be collected with PK sample.
kPhysical examination, vital signs, and ECG should be obtained before spirometry pr ocedures and IP administration.
lFor adults, height will be measured at screening only. For patients <18 years of age, height will be measured at screening, D oR, and EOT. Use of a stadiometer is preferable, if 
available, or use a cloth tape securely attached to the wall that will allow reproducible results. Height should be measured in centimeters, without shoes.
mPre-bronchodilator sp irometry assessments should only be performed after withholding short -acting bronchodilators (ie, inhaled short- acting beta -agonists and/or short acting 
anticholinergics) for at least 6 hours and long -acting bronchodilators (ie, inhaled LABAs and long -
acting anticholinergic agents) for at least 12 or 24 hours, according to their 
labeled dose schedule. Spirometry should be performed prior to IP administration, if applicable.
nOptional at visits 2 -11.
oFor post-bronchodilatory spirometry, short -acting beta -agonists, such as salbutamol or albuterol, administered via a metered dose inhaler should be used. Four separate doses (eg, 
albuterol 360 μg or salbutamol 100 μg ex -valve) should be given by a metered dose inhaler as tolerated. Post -bronchodilator spirometry should be completed a minimum of 15 
minutes after dosing of short -acting beta -agonist.
pBlood samples for PK and ADA analysis will be drawn before administration of study drug.
qIf possible, a blood sample for measurement of serum reslizumab concentrations will b e obtained from patients experiencing an adverse event leading to withdrawal, a serious 
adverse event, an observation of any severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis), or an exacerbation of asthma symptom s.
rIf a patient experiences worsening of his or her asthma symptoms, the patient is to call the study center within 48 hours (if possible) to be evaluated for his or her asthma 
symptoms. Procedures and assessments to be performed if an unscheduled visit occurs are described in Protocol Section 3.16.5.
sBased on investigator's assessment.
tAdverse event inquiry will occur before and after study drug administration at V3 to V16. Follow -up any prior messages from the post -injection eDiary symptom inquiry, as 
necessary. For systemic or severe hypersensitivity reactions possibly related to the study drug, initiate the ana phylaxis CRF. When such reactions are observed after study drug 
administration in the clinic, vital signs must be monitored using the unscheduled vital signs CRF. At the time of myalgia/mus cular adverse events, CPK should be collected 
(initiate myalgia CRF ).

643.16.1. Procedures for Screening and Enrollment (Visit 1)
A signed and dated ICFwill be obtained from all patients 18 years of age or older before any  
study-specific screening procedures are performed (see Section 12.1). For patients 12 through 
<18years of age, a signed and dated ICFwill be obtained from a parent/legal guardian, and a 
signed and dated assent form will be obtained from each patient before screening procedures 
commence, according to local IEC/I RB requirements. Evaluations obtained as part of routine 
medical care and performed during the screening period may  be used in place of the 
study-specific evaluations. I n addition, disease -specific assessments performed within a specified 
timeframe before informed consent may  be used for the study. Parents/legal guardians will 
acknowledge and agree to the possible use of this information for the stud y by giving informed 
consent.
After informed consent is obtained, patients who are screened will be assigned an 8 -digit 
permanent identification number such that all patients from each investigational center are given 
consecutive identification numbers in successive order of inclusion. The first 2 digits of the 
screening number will be the number assigned to the country  where the investigational cen ter is 
located, the next 3digits will be the designated investigator center number, and the last 3 digits 
will be assigned at the investigator center (eg, if the number assi gned to the country  is 01, the 
thirdpatient screened at center 5 would be given t he number of 01005003).
A patient who is screened but not randomized, for example , because entry  criteria were not met, 
may be considered for screening once more, for example , if there is a change in the patient’s 
medical background or a modification of study entry criteria.Patients may  be screened again if 
they did not meet spirometry /reversibility  criteria initially . Theduration between the date of 
Screen Failure and the re -screening must be >30 days.
The following procedures will be performed at the screening visit ( visit 1):
Obtain written informed consent before an y other study -related procedures are 
performed
Review medical history
Review prior and concomitant medication 
Review inclusion/exclusion criteria
Perform reversibility  testing
if long-acting and short -acting inhaled bronchodilators 
were held for the specified time; if not, the patient should be brought back on another 
day to complete. Reversibility  testing may  be repeated once within the 2-week 
screening period. Airway reversibility  will be demonstrated b y measuring the change 
in FEV 1before and after inhalation of SABA; reversibility  testing should only  be 
attempted after withholding short -acting bronchodilators (ie, inhaled short- acting 
beta-adrenergic agonists and/or short -acting anticho linergics) for at least 6 hours and 
long-acting bronchodilators (ie, inhaled long -acting beta -adrenergic agonists and 
long-acting anticholinergic agents) for at least 12 or 24 hours, according to their 
labeled dose schedule. SABAs, such as salbutamol or albuterol, administered via a 
metered dose inhaler should be used forreversibility  testing. Four separate doses 
(eg,albuterol 360 μg or salbutamol 100 μg ex- valve) should be given b y a metered 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
65dose inhaler, as tolerated. Post -bronchodilator spirometry sh ould be completed a 
minimum of 15 minutes after dosing of SABA.
Perform serum pregnancy  testing (female patients who are not 2 y ears 
postmenopausal or surgically  sterile only)
Perform clinical labor atory tests (chemistry , hematology , and urinalysis); only 
patients with an eosinophil counts o f 300 eosinophils/μL  or greater at screening while 
on chronic OCS, or those with a documented level of at least 3 00 eosinophils/μL  
during the previous 12 months will be eligible to continue in the study
○ Note: a patient w ill meet inclusion criteria if an eosinophil count of 300/μL or 
greater becomes manifest during the OCS optimization period or at the 
week-2 visit(end of optimization period/beginning of run- in period).
Perform full ph ysical examination
Perform vital signs assessments (includes sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, 
body temperature, and respiratory  rate)
Measure height and weight
Perform ECG
Perform pre bronchodilator spirometry
Collect blood for HIV, hepatitis B , and hepatitis Ctesting
Informpatients of study  restrictions and compliance requirements

A patient who is not randomly  assigned to treatment on the basis of the results of baseline/DoR
assessments (eg, because entry  criteria were not met or enrollment did not occur within the
specified time) may  be considered for rescreening if there is a change in the patient’s medical 
background, a modification of study  entry criteria, or other relevant change. A patient may be 
rescreened for thi s reason 1 time only . The duration between the first visit during the screening 
period and the rescreening must be >30 day s. Patients may  be screened again if they did not meet 
spirometry /reversibility  criteria initially .
Patients who continue to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a permanent 
unique randomization number and a treatment number generated b y IRT. These 2 newl y 
assigned numbers will be entered into the CRF, and study  drug will be dispensed. The following 
procedures/assessments will be performed during and after administration of study  drug on day  
1:
Patients will be observed for 1 hour after stud y injection/baseline/DoR assessments
Evaluation of injection site for reaction at approximately  1 hour after dosing using the 
injection site CRF. Clinically  significant injection site reactions should be recorded as 
an adverse event.
If, during post -study drug observation, the patient develops clinical s ymptoms, vital 
signs should be collected. The pat ient should be assessed for 
anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity  reactions as detailed in Section7.1.7.
Remind the patients that they  will receive a post -injection sy mptom inquiry  via the eDiary .

724. SELECTION AND WITHDR AWAL OF PATIENTS
Prospective waivers (exceptions) from study  eligibility  criteria to allow patients to enter a study  
are not granted by  Teva (see Section 11.1.2).
4.1. Patient Inclusion Criteria
Patients may  be included in the study  only if they meet all of the following cri teria:
a.The patient is male or female , 12years of age and older , witha previous diagnosis of 
asthma.Patients 12 to <18 y ears of age are excluded from participating in South 
Korea, the Netherlands ,and Argentina, and patients 66 y ears of age and older are 
excluded from participating in South Korea.
b.Writteninformed consent is obtained. During the screening period, a signed and dated 
informed consent form (ICF) (and an assent form for children 12 thr ough <18 y ears 
of age in accordance with local standards) will be obtained before a diagnosis of 
asthma is confirmed on the basis of patient history  and by demonstration of airway  
reversibility .
c.The patient continues to require an average daily  maintenance dose of OCS for 
asthma of between 5 and 40 mg of prednisone or equivalent duringthe 3 months 
beforescreening. Patients on an OCS dose of >40 mg at screening who the 
investigator believes may be able to decrease OCS dose to ≤40 mg during the 
optimization period may  also be enrolled. Note: every-other-day dosing that is within 
this daily average ( ie,10 to 80 mg) is allowed.
d.The patient has a documented blood eosinophil level of at least 300/L during the 
previous 12 months while on at least medium total d aily dose of ICSbased on Global 
Initiative for Asthma 2016 clinical comparability  table(Appendix A),or ≥300/L at 
screening while on chronic OCS or that becomes manifest during the OCS 
optimization period or at the w eek -2 visit(end of optimization period/beginning of 
run-in period) .
e.Thepatient has required at least 880μg of inhaled fluticasone propionate or 
equivalent dail y PLUS another controller(s) (eg, LABA, long-actinganti-muscarinic 
antagonist , leukotriene inhibitor, or theophy lline) or documented intolerance to 
another controlle r for at least 6 months beforethe screening visit. For a fixed-dose 
ICS/LABA preparation, the highest labeled dose in that region will satisfy  this 
criterion. For patients 12 through <18years of age, the I CS dose must correspond to 
at least a medium total daily  ICS dose. Note: the dose and regimen of asthma 
controllers and an y allergen immunotherap y should have been stable during the 
30days beforesigning the Informed Assent Form/ICF.
f.The patient has FEV1reversibilit y of at least 12% after administr ation of inhaled 
relievermedication according to the standard American Thoracic Societ y (ATS) or 
European Respiratory  Society (ERS)protocol. Given the refractory  nature of the 
disease in this population and the influence of high background controller 
medications on reversibility  testing, documented FEV 1reversibility  of 12% or a
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
73provocation concentratio nproducing a 20% fall in FEV1for methacholine of 
≤8mg/mL within 24 months of the screening visit, and performed according to the 
standard ATS/ERS procedures, would fulfill this criterion. Patients may  be screened 
again if they  did not meet spirometry /reversibility  criteria initially . The duration 
between the date of Screen Failure and the re -screening must be >30 days.
g.Femalesof childbearing potential (not surgically  sterile by hysterectomy , bilateral 
salpingectomy , bilateral oophorectom y, or2years postmenopausal ) must have 
exclusively  same-sex partners or use medically  acceptable methods of birth control 
and must agree to continue use of this method for the duration of the stud y and for 5 
months after the last study drug dose. Acceptable methods of birth control include 
intrauterine device, s ystemic hormonal contraceptive (oral, implanted, transdermal, or 
injected), b arrier method with spermicide, abstinence, bilateral fallopian tube 
occlusion, and partnervasectomy . 
h.The patient must be willing and able to compl y with study  restrictions, willing and 
able to perform requisite procedures and remain at the clinic for the requir ed duration 
during the stud y period, and willing to return to the clinic for the follow -up evaluation 
as specified in this protocol. 
i.Except for the OCS, which will be adjusted per protocol, the patient must maintain 
his/her usual asthma controller regimenwithout change throughout the screening , 
optimization, run -in, and treatment periods.
4.2. Patient Exclusion Criteria
Patients will be excluded from participating in this study  if they meet anyof the following 
criteria:
a.The patient has an y clinically significant, uncontrolled medical condition (treated or 
untreated) that would interfere with the stud y schedule or procedures and 
interpretation of efficacy  results or would compromise the patient’s safet y.
b.The patient has another confounding underl ying lung disorder (eg, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary  disease, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis [also known as Churg- Strauss sy ndrome], or allergic 
bronchopulmonary  aspergillosis).
c.The patient has a known hypereosinophilic sy ndrome.
d.The patient has a history  of any malignancy  within 5 y ears of the screening visit, 
except for treated and cured non melanoma skin cancers.
e.The patient is pregnantor intends to become pregnant during the stud yor within 
5months from last dose of study  drug or is lactating. An y woman becoming pregnant 
during the stud y will be w ithdrawn from the study .
f.The patient required treatment for an asthma exacerbation within 4 weeks of 
screening.
g.The patient is a current smoker (ie, has smo ked within the last 6 months before
screening) or has a smoking history ≥10 pack -years.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
74h.The patient is currently  using any systemic immunosuppressive or 
immunomodulatory  biologic agents (eg, anti -immunoglobulin E mAb or other mAb
[eg, mepolizumab] or soluble receptor) or nonbiologic (eg, methotrexate, 
cyclosporine), except maintenance OCSfor the treatment of asthma. Previous use of 
such agents that occurred >5 half- lives from the screening visit may be allowed, if 
approved b y the medical monitor.
i.The patient participated in a clinical study within 30 day s or 5 half -lives of the 
investigational drug before screening, whichever is longer.
j.The patient waspreviously  exposed to benralizumab within 12 months of screening .
k.The patientwaspreviously  exposed toreslizumab .
l.The patient has a history  of immunodeficiency  disorder including HIV.
m.The patient has current suspected drug and /oralcohol abuse.
n. The patient has had an active helminthic parasitic infection or was treated for one 
within 6 months of screening . 
o.The patient has a history  of allergic reactions or hy persensitivity  to any component of 
the study drug.
p.The patient has a history  of latex allergy .(The current prefilled s yringe device has a 
natural rubber component to the needle shield.)
4.3. Justification for Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion and exclusion criteria select for an OCS-dependent asthma phenoty pe with 
elevated eosinophils and that is likely  to benefit from a targeted therapy  such as reslizumab, 
while ensuring that enrolled patients are of sufficient health quality  to ensure that participation in 
this study  will not put them at unnecessary  risk.
4.4. Randomization criteria
After completion of the optimization/run- in period, patients may  continue in the study  if they 
meet all of the f ollowing criteria:
a.The patient must be using an average daily  dose of no less than 5 mg of prednisone 
after OCS optimization. A patient requiring less than 5 mg of prednisone to maintain 
control should not be randomized.
b.The patient must be using an average daily  dose of no more than 40 mg of prednisone 
after OCS optimization. A patient requiring more than 40 mg of prednisone to 
maintain control should not be randomized.
c.The patient should not have had an asthma exacerbation during the run -in period, 
defined as requiring a burst of sy stemic corticosteroid for an asthma worsening 
(injection, or if oral, at least a do ubling from the current OCS dose for at least 
3days); an asthma -specific hospital admission; or an asthma -specific emergency  
department vi sit.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
75d.The patient must have completed at least 4 day s of diary  entries (or any  combination 
of 4 morning and 4 evening recordings) during the last 7 day s of the run- in period.
4.5. Criteria and Procedures for Discontinuation of Study Treatment 
and/or Study Withdrawal
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country ’s 
acceptance), patients may voluntaril y discontinue study  treatment ( ie, refuse study  treatment but 
continue with study  participation) or completel y withdraw from the stud y (ie, with no further 
study participation or contact) at an y time. The investigator also has the right to discontinue a 
patient from study treatment and/or withdraw a patient from the study  in the event of intercurrent 
illness, adverse eve nts, pregnancy  (see 
Section7.2), or other reasons concerning the health or 
well-being of the patient, or in the event of lack of cooperation. 
If a patient withdraws consent, every  attempt will be made to determine the reason. If the reason 
for withdrawal is an adverse event or a potentiall y clinically significant abnormal laboratory  test 
result, monitoring will be continued until the event has resolv ed or stabilized, until the patient is 
referred to the care of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to 
the study drug or study  procedure is made. The specific event or test result must be recorded on 
the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. If possible, a blood sample for 
measurement of serum reslizumab concentrations will be obtained from patients experiencing an 
adverse event leading to withdrawal, a serious adverse event, an observation of any  severe 
hypersensitivity  reaction (eg, anaph ylaxis), or an exacerbation of asthma s ymptoms.
4.5.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment
If premature discontinuation of study  treatment occurs for any  reason,the patient should 
continue attending remaining stud y visits while of f study treatment. The patient will continue to 
receive study  provided OCS (prednisone) treatment for the remainder of their participation in the 
study. The patient should not be considered withdrawn from the stud y due to interrupti onor 
discontinuation of study treatment. For this study , it is very  important to continue collecting data 
from all patients whether or not they complete treatment.
If premature discontinuation of study  treatment occurs, the patient should return to the clinic as 
soon as possible for a study  treatment discontinuation visit. All evaluations should be performed 
as specified in the protocol for the early  withdrawal visit (see Table5). The investigator must 
determine the reason for and the date of discontinuation of study  treatment and record this 
information in both the source documentation and the Study  Drug Treatment Completion CRF. 
The patient’s continued participation in the st udy must be discussed by  the investigator and site 
staff with the patient; the investigator and site staff must also request the patient to continue 
attending stud y visits according to the stud y visit schedule with all assessments completed up to 
week 24 (visit 1 9). The OCS dose and safety assessments at week 24 (visit 1 9) are the priority  
assessments for patients that prematurely  discontinue study  treatment. At a minimum, the 
investigator should make every effort to obtain information regarding serious adv erse events, 
OCS dose , and survival status at week 24. A safety  follow-up visit (visit 20) should be conducted 
8 weeks after visit 19.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
764.5.2. Complete Withdrawal from Study
If a patient decides to completely  withdraw from the study  (ie, refuses an y further stud y 
participation or contact), all study  participation for that patient will cease and all data to be 
collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. If a patient decides to completely  
withdraw from the stud y, every effort should be made to complete and report the observations 
outlined in Section 4.5.1(Discontinuation of Study  Treatment) beforewithdrawal. A complete 
final evaluation at the ti me of the patient’s withdrawal should be made, including an explanation 
of why the patient is withdrawing from the stud y. The reason for and date of withdraw alfrom the 
study must be recorded in the source documentation and the Double -Blind Treatment Perio d 
Completion CRF.
For patients who are lost to follow -up (ie, patients whose status is unclear because they  fail to 
appear for stud y visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the investigator should make 
appropriate efforts to re -establish contact with patient; attempts to contact the patient should be 
documented in the source documents. If contact has not been re- established, efforts should still 
be made to locate the patient and obtain information regarding serious adverse events, OCS dose , 
and survival status at the end of the 24- week treatment period. A patient should only  be 
designated as lost to follow-up if the site is unable to establish contact with the patient after 
3documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e -mail, certifi ed letter, etc).

775. TREATMENT OF PATIENT S
5.1. Drugs Administered During the Study
After successfull y meeting entry criteria, eligible patients will be ran domly assigned to st udy 
drug (110 mg of reslizumab or placebo) with stratification based on maintenance OCSdose of 
>10 mg or ≤10 mg and age (12 to <18years of age or 18 y ears of age or older) at baseline, using 
IRT, which uses computerized central randomization. Study  drug will be administered by  
qualified study  personnel as sc injections in the upper arm (s)once every 4weeks for a total of 
6doses.
The pre-filled syringe has a staked 27G 0.5-inch needle. Subcutaneous injections can be given at 
a 90° angle or at a 45° angle. The injection can be given at a 90° angle if 2 inches of skin can be 
grasped between t he thumb and first finger. If only  1inch of skin can be grasped, the injection 
should be done at a 45° angle. The sites where injections are given should be at least 1 inch away 
from each other. Product should be removed from the refrigerator and allowed to equilibrate at 
room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before administration.
Study drug will be administered by  qualified stud y personnel who will ensure that the stud y drug 
is administered in accordance with the protocol. The needle shields of the prefilled s yringes 
contain natural rubber latex, which may  cause allergic reactions; see exclusion criterion (p). 
Additional information regarding stud y drug can be found in the Pharmacy Manual.
A more detailed description of the reslizumab drug pro duct is provided in Section 3.11.1.Study 
drug exposure will be measured and compliance to study  drug administration will be monitored.
5.2. Restrictions
Medications prohibited before and/or during the study  are described in Section 5.3. Restrictions 
are provided in the in clusion and exclusion criteri a.
5.3. Prior and Concomitant Therapy or Medication
Any prior or concomitant therapy , medication, or procedure a patient has had at screening up to 
the end of the stud yperiod, including follow -up, will be recorded on the CRF. Generic or trade 
name, indication, and dosage will be recorded. Sy stemic corticosteroids and other medications 
will each be recorded in separate CRFs. The sponsor will encode all therapy  and medication 
according to the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary  (WHODrug).
Excluding OCS, which will be adjusted per protocol, the patient’s baseline asthma therap y 
regimen (including, but not limited to, ICS, leukotriene antagonists, 5- lipoxygenase inhibitors, 
cromolyn) must be stable for 30 day s beforescreening and continue without dosage changes 
throughout the stud y. Of note, prior asthma medications such as ICS, leukotriene pathway  
modifiers, long -actingbronchodilators, and mast cell stabilizers may  be taken concomitantl y and 
should not be altered d uring this study  unless the patient’s safety is at risk. Changes in 
background mainte nancetherapy must be discussed with the medical monitor.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
78The following medications will not be allowed during this study :
Patients should refrain from using relieverinhalersfor 6 hours before any study visit 
that includes spirometry  or airway  reversibility  testing, including the screening visit.
If a patient is taking LABAs, these should be withheld for 12 hours beforeany study 
visit that includes spirometry  or airway  reversibility  testing, including the screening 
visit.
Any immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory  agents (biological and
non-biological), including, but not limited to methotrexate, cy closporine, and
interferon ( excluding s ystemic corticosteroids prescribed for asthma and maintenance
allergen immunotherap y)
All biologic therapies, including, but not limited to omalizumab (Xolair®), 
mepolizumab, benralizumab, lebrikizumab, and anti- tumor necrosis factor 
monoclonal antibodies
All nonbiologic investigational drugs
Inhaled nicotine (including electronic cigarettes)
At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator will ask patients whether they  have
taken any medications (other than study  drug), including over -the-counter medications, vitamins,
or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit. I ndication, dosage, and start and
end dates should be entered on the appropriate CRF.
5.4. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance
Theinvestigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. A check of stud y drug 
compliance will be performed during each visit after the initial dispensation of study  drug, and 
study drug accountabilit y records will be completed. Compliance for OCS will be check ed using 
pill counting at each study visit. If the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is 
not in compliance with the study  protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine 
whether the patient should be withdr awn. The IEC/I RB should be notified.
5.5. Total Blood Volume
Blood draws will be separated b y at least 2 weeks. The estimated total blood volume withdrawn 
over the entire study  (including screening) is approximately  125mL.To further reduce the 
volume of bloodwithdrawn, pediatric tubes will be used when possible.

796. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CYAND IMMUNOGENICITY
6.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Justification
Percent reduction in the daily  OCSdose will be categorized as follows:
90% to 100%
75% to <90%
50% to <75%
>0% to <50%
No decrease in OCS, loss of baseline asthma control during weeks 20 through 24, or 
discontinuation from study  drug
Loss of baseline asthma control will be defined as FEV1less than 80% of baseline at the week 24 
visit, clinically  significant worsening in ACQ-6 score (change in score of 0.5) at the week 24 
visitcompared with baseline , and/or CAE(as defined in Section 6.7)during weeks 20 
through24.

Pre-bronchodilator FEV 1, FVC, FEF25%-75%,and post-bronchodilator FEV 1will be measured 
using spirometry . The FEV 1is the volume of air that can be forcibl y exhaled from the lungs in 
the first second, meas ured in liters. The FVC is the volume of air that can be forcibl y blown out 
after full inspiration, measured in liters . The FEF 25%-75% is the forced expiratory  flow at 25% to 
75% forced vital capacity .For post-bronchodilatory  spirometry , SABAs, such as salbutamol or 
albuterol, administ ered via a metered dose inhaler should be used. Four separate doses (eg, 
albuterol 360 μg or salbutamol 100 μg ex -valve) should be given b y a metered dose inhaler, as 
tolerated. Post -bronchodilator spirometry  should be completed a minimum of 15 minutes aft er 
dosing of SABA. Spirometry  will be done according to ATS /ERS2005 procedural guidelines. 
The National Health and Nutrition Survey  III reference equations will be used.
6.3. PEF monitoring
AMand PMambulatory  PEF will be measured using a PEF meter. PEF is th e maximum speed of 
exhalation. AM and PM ambulatory  PEF will be measured by  the patient and recorded in the 
asthma control diary .
6.4. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for Patients 12 Years and 
Older
The AQLQ +12 is a modified version of the standardized AQ LQ (AQLQ[S]), which was 
developed to measure functional impairments experienced b y adults ≥17 years of age. The 
AQLQ +12 is valid for patients 12 to 70 y ears of age and includes 32 questions in 4 domains 
(symptoms, activity  limitation, emotional function, and environmental stimuli)
(Juniperet al1992,Wyrwich et al 2011 ).Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
80previous 2 week s and score each of the questions on a 7 -point scale where 7=no impairment and 
1=severe impairment (Appendix B).
6.5. Asthma Control Questionnaire
The ACQ-6 is a validated asthma assessment tool that has been widel y used(Juniper et al 1999). 
There are 6 self -assessment questions .Each item on the ACQ -6has a possible score ranging 
from 0 to 6, and the total score is the mean of all responses ( Appendix C).
6.6. Asthma Symptom Assessment
The asthma s ymptom score will be determined from the information recorded in the asthma 
control diary . A Likert-style scale will be used to quantify  symptomatology . This scale has been 
used previousl y to assess changes in asthma s ymptoms in response to novel asthma treatme nts 
(Shapiro et al 2000). Every morning and evening, patients will indicate how much they  are 
bothered b y their asthma symptoms , as shown in Appendix D.
6.7. Asthma Exacerbations
The number of CAEs requiring a burst of s ystemic corticosteroid (oral, iv, or im) and the 
time-to-first CAE will be measured.
A CAEis defined as a clinically  judged deterioration in asthma control ,as determined b y the 
investigator and as evidenced b y new or worsening asthma signs or s ymptoms based on the 
patient history , asthma control diary , physical examination, and/or ambulatory  or clinic visit 
assessment of lung function AND that results in a medic al intervention, including at least 1 of 
the following:
use of systemic corticosteroids ( injection, or if oral, at least a doubling from the
currentOCS dose for at least 3 day s)
asthma-specific hospital admission
asthma-specific emergency  department visit
Additional medication and/or medical intervention that would satisfy  the 
CAEdefinition 
occurring within 7 days of the last day  of a prior CAEevent will be considered as part of the 
same event for anal ysis purposes.
The CAEstart and stop dates will be collected in order to determine the exacerbation duration. 
The start date of a CAEwill be the start date of the initial medical intervention (eg, use of 
systemic corticosteroids [injection, or if oral at least a doubling from the current OCS dose for at 
least 3 day s], asthma -specific hospital admission, or asthma -specific emergency  department visit, 
whichever comes first). The stop date is the last day  of systemic corticosteroids (injectable), or 
for those with a doubling of t he OCS dose, the stop date is when the return to their baseline dose, 
or the last day  of an asthma -specific hospitalization or emergency  department visit, whichever is 
later. For patients receiving at least a doubling from their current dose of OCS for at least 3 day s 
that did not return to baseline (dose before exacerbation), an asthma exacerbation stop date will 
be the day  that they have been on a new stable dose for at least 10 day s.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
81If a patient experiences an asthma exacerbation, theyshould be treated with an OCS burst: 40 to 
60 mg (or at least double his/her current dose) tapered over a 7- to 10-day period to a new 
maintenance dose of 2.5 mg above the pre- burst dose. It is understood that imor ivcorticosteroid 
may also be administered as part of the treatm ent of the asthma exacerbation. If a second OCS 
burst is required, the patient should be maintained on a fixed OCS dose for the remainder of th e 
double-blind treatment phase.
If possible, a bloo d sample for measurement of serum reslizumab concentrations will be obtained 
from patients experiencing an exacerbation of asthma sy mptoms, a serious adverse event, an 
observation of an y severe hypersensitivity  reaction (eg, anaph ylaxis), or an adverseevent leading 
to withdrawal.
6.8. European Quality of Life 5 -Dimension Health State Utility Index
The EQ-5D is a standardized questionnaire that assesses overall state of health (Appendix E).
The EQ-5D consists of 2 parts. In the first part, patients rate their health state in 5 health 
domains: mobility , self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression using a 
scale of 1 to 3 where 1=no problem, 2=some problems, and 3=major problems. The second part 
consists of a 100 mm visual analog scale on which patients rate their perceived health state 
(0=worst imaginable health state, 100=best imaginable health state).
6.9. Inhaled R elieverMedication Use
The number of times asthma reliever therapy (number of inhalations) is used will be assessed by  
reviewing the electronic asthma control diary .Note: Inhaled relievertherapy used for exercise 
beforetreatment should not be recorded.
6.10. Nighttime Awakenings Requiring Rescue Inhaler Use
Patients will record nighttime awakenings and the amount of rescue medication taken in their 
electronic asthma control diary . The number of nighttime awakenings requiring rescue inhaler
treatment will be determined based on the review of these recorded data.

837. ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY
In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study  staff by evaluating the following:
Adverse eventsthroughout the study
Clinical laboratory  test results (serum chemistry at screening, DoR/baseline, week12, 
and week 24 or earl y withdrawal; hematology  throughout the study ;urinalysis at 
screening )
Vital signs (pulse, respiratory  rate, body  temperature, and blood pressure) throughout 
the study
ECG at screening and week 24 or early withdrawal
Physical examination f indings (including bod y weight and height measurements)
throughout the stud y
Signs and/or s ymptoms of adrenal insufficiency  (OCS wi thdrawal effects) throughout 
the study
Concomitant medication usage throughout the study
7.1. Adverse Events 
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of wh ether it has a causal relationship with this treatment. 
In this stud y, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patient has signed the ICF
should be recorded and reported as an adverse event. 
An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorabl e and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or 
laboratory  parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of thisstudy, or 
significant worsening of the disease under study  or of any  concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the study  drug. Asthma exacerbation is an efficacy  variable for this study  
and should be captured on the asthma exacerbation CRF; accordingl y, asthma exacerbations 
should not be recorded as adverse events unless assessed as more severe than the patient's usual 
disease course. In this case, the investigator should determine if the adverse event is nonserious 
or serious based on serio usness criteria, as defined in Section 7.1.6. A new condition or the 
worsening of a pre -existing condition will be considered an adverse event. Stab le chronic 
conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before study  entry and do not worsen during this
study will not be considered adverse events. 
Accordingl y, an adverse event can include an y of the following:
intercurrent illnesses
physical injuri es
events possibly  related to concomitant medication
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
84significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency) of pre -existing 
conditions
drug interactions
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
fromthe study, are associated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious adverse 
event, require medical treatment or further diagnostic work- up, or are considered b y 
the investigator to be clinically  significant. (Note: Abnormal laboratory  test results at 
the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study  or receiving study  
treatment are not considered adverse events.)
events associated to study  procedure (eg, clinically significant adrenal insufficiency )
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Ev ents
For adverse event recording, the stud y period is defined for each patient as that time period from 
signature of the ICFthrough the end of the follow- up period. For this study, the follow -up period 
is defined as 8 weeks after the EOT visit. Adverse events will be collected at each visit, 
including the follow -up visit, via adverse event inquiry . 
All adverse events that occur during the defined study  period must be recorded on the source 
documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, regardless of the severit y or seriousness of the 
event or judged relationship to the study  drug. For serious adverse events, the Serious Adverse 
Event Form must also be completed and the serious adverse event must b e reported immediatel y 
(see Section7.1.6.3.1). The investigator does not need to activel y monitor subjects for adverse 
events once the study has ended. Serious adverse events that occur to a patient after the end of 
the study should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following 
the procedures described in Se ction 7.1.6.3.1.
At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events b y asking an open- ended question such as, “Have y ou had any  unusual sy mptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe .” In addition, the eDiary  will be 
programmed to query  the patient about sy mptoms potentially  consistent with hy persensitivity  
occurring during the 24 hour period following study drug injection . All reported or observed 
signs and s ymptoms will be recorded individuall y, except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. 
When such a diagnosis is made, all related s igns, symptoms, and any  test findings will be 
recorded collectively  as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, also 
on the Serious Adverse Event Form.
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable inte rvals until resolved, 
stabilized, returned to baseline, or until the patient is referred for continued care to another health 
care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the stud y drug or study  
procedure is made.
The onset and end d ates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action 
taken regarding study  drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. The approxima te time of 
onset for each adverse event that starts within 24 hours of study  drug administration will be also 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
85recorded. The relationship of each adverse event to study  drug treatment and study  procedures, 
and the severity  and seriousness of each adverse ev ent, as judged b y the investigator, must be 
recorded as described below.
7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event
The severit y of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:
Mild: No limitation of usual activities
Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities
Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug
The relationship of an adverse event to the study  drug is characterized as follows:
Term Definition Clarification
No reasonable 
possibility
(not related)This category applies to adverse 
events which, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
events, which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the study drug.The relationship of a n adverse eventmay be considered 
“no reasonable possibility ”if it is clearly du e to 
extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply :
it does not follow  a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the administration of the test drug.
it could readily have been produced by the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the patient.
it does not follow  a known patte rn of response to the 
test drug. 
it does not reappear or w orsen when the drug is 
re-administered.
Reasonable 
possibility
(related)This category applies to adverse 
events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with 
the test drug administration cannot be 
ruled out with certainty nor felt w ith 
a high degree of certainty to be 
related to the study drug.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“reasonable possibility ”if at least 2 of the f ollowing
apply:
it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug.
it cannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.
it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness 
clearly exists.
it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug.
7.1.5. Relationship of an Adverse Event to OCS Reduction
The relationship of an adverse event to OCS reduction (such as sy mptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency ) will be indicated (y es/no) on the CRF.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
867.1.6. Serious Adverse Events
7.1.6.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any  of the 
following outcomes or actions:
death
a life-threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death
inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which means that 
hospital inpatient admission and/or prolongation of hospit al stay were required for 
treatment of an adverse event, or that they  occurred as a consequence of the event.
Hospitalizations scheduled before stud y entry will not be considered serious adverse 
events, unless there was worsening of the preexisting conditi on during the patient’s 
participation in this study . Note: Hospitalizations due to asthma exacerbation will be 
reported as serious adverse events if the presentation or outcome is more severe than 
the patient’s known course of asthma
persistent or signific ant disability  or incapacity  (refers to a substantial disruption of 
one’s ability  to conduct normal life functions)
a congenital anomaly /birth defect
an important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization b ut may jeopardize the patient and may  require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or conv ulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse . Note: Any suspected transmission of 
an infectious agent via a medicinal product is consid ered an important medical event
An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.
7.1.6.2. Expectedness
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safet y information by  its specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an 
unexpected adverse event. The reference safet y information for this study is the IB. The 
sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department will determine the expectedness for all serious adverse 
events.
7.1.6.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
7.1.6.3.1. Investigator Responsibility
To satisfy  regulatory  requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section7.1.6.1) 
(including the protocol- defined follow -up period, described in Section 7.1.2), regardless of 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
87judged relationship to treatment with the study  drug, must be reported to the sponsor by  the 
investigator within 24 hours of when the investigator learns about it.Completing the serious 
adverse event form and reporting the event must not be delayed, even if not all the information is 
available. The investigator does not need to actively  monitor subjects for adverse events once the 
studyhas ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patientafter the studyshould be reported 
to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them.
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safet y officer (LSO) or other 
designated personnel (a contract research organization [ CRO]in acountry without a sponsor 
LSO)(contactinformation is in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information sectio n); the 
LSO will f orward the report to t he sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance
Department .
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately  and completel y:
study number
investigator and investigational center identification
patientnumber
patient initials
onset date and description of adverse event
investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study  drug 
(no reasonable possibility , reasonable possibility )
Additional information may  include the following:
age and sex of patient
date of first dose of study drug
date and amount of last administered dose of study drug
action taken
outcome, if known
severity
concomitant therap y (including doses, routes, and regimens) and treatment of the 
event
pertinent laborat ory or other diagnostic test data 
medical history
results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known
for an adverse event resulting in death: 
cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study  drugas determined 
by the investigator)
autopsy findings (if available)
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
88Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated b y the investigator and the 
sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the study  drug, study  
procedures, and to underlying disease. The sponsor will also evaluate the expectedness of all 
serious adverse events.
Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded b y the investigational center within 24 hours of when it becomes 
known to the same address as the initial report.
For all countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety  & Pharmacovigilance Department will 
distribute the Council for I nternational Or ganizations of Medical Sciences form/XML  file to the 
LSO/CRO for local submission to the regulatory  authorities, IEC/I RBs, and investigators, 
according to regulations. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the I RB/EC is also 
informed of the event, in accordance with local regulations.
Blinding will be ma intained for the people who are involved directly  in the study . Therefore, in 
case of a SUSAR, only  the LSO/CRO will receive from pharmacovigilance the unblinded report 
for regulatory  submission; the others will receive a blinded report. 
Note: Although pr egnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy  is 
the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event, but using the pregnancy  form (see 
Section7.2). 
If possible, a blood sample for measurement of serum reslizumab concentrations will be obtained 
from patients experiencing a serious adverse event, an adverse event leading to withdrawal, an 
observation of an y severe hypersensitivity  reaction (eg, anaph ylaxis), or an exacerbation of 
asthma sy mptoms.
7.1.6.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the stud y drug or study  
procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify  all investigators participating in 
sponsored clinical studies of reslizumab and the appropriate regulatory  authorities (and IEC/IRB, 
if appropriate) . 
In addition to notify ing the investiga tors and regulatory  authorities (and IEC/IRB, if appropriate), 
other measures may  be required, including the following:
altering existing research by  modifying the protocol
discontinuing or suspending the stud y
altering the process of informed consent b y modifying the existing consent form and 
informing current stud yparticipants of new findings
modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newl y identified as 
related to reslizumab
7.1.7. Specific Protocol-Defined Adverse Events
7.1.7.1. Adrenal Insufficiency
Adrenal insufficiency  will be treated as an adverse event.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
89Patients who experience the clinical sy mptoms of adrenal insufficiency  (fatigue, weakness, 
anorexia, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, my algia) will be instructed to come 
to the study  center for vital signs and evaluation by  a physician if possible. Patients with severe 
symptoms will be instructed to procee d to the emergency  department.
Blood samples will be taken for:
cortisol level ( beforeiv corticosteroids or oral corticosteroid dose increase if 
possible) 
calcium level
sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, creatinine, carbon dioxide , and blood urea 
nitrogen ( BUN)levels
CBC with differential
Patients determined to have mild sy mptoms of adrenal insufficiency  may have their OCS dose 
increased back to the previously  effective OCS lev el (at the investigator’s discretion).
Patients determined to have clinically significant adrenal insufficiency  will be instructed to (at 
minimum) double or triple their corticosteroid dose for ≥2 days.
Then,based on resolution of sy mptoms: 
If they recently (≤7 days) had a dose reduction, they  will be instructed to return their 
corticosteroid dose to the previously  effective OCS level.
If they have not had a recent dose reduction and another factor precipitated the 
adrenal insufficiency  (eg,infection), they  should be treated for the inciting factor 
beforeOCS dose reduction.
7.1.7.2. Protocol-Defined Adverse Events for Expedited R eporting to Teva
For the purposes of this protocol, the following are considered protocol -defined adverse events 
for expedited reporting to Teva: anaph ylaxis, newly  diagnosed malignancy, opportunistic 
infection, and parasitic helminth infection. Protocol -defined adverse events for expedited 
reporting can be either serious or nonserious according to the criteria outlined in Se ction7.1.6.1. 
The process for reporting a protocol- defined adverse event for expedited reporting is the same as 
that for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section7.1.6.3).A list of potential opportunistic 
infections is found in Appendix I.
7.1.7.3. Specific Adverse EventCase Report FormC apturing
7.1.7.3.1. Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions Case Report Form
Information about al l suspected anaphy laxis events will be recorded on the Suspected 
Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity  Reactions CRF , including the investigator's assessment if the 
event followed the definition of anaphy laxisbased on the diagnostic criteria as outlined by the 
2006 Joint NI AID/FAAN Second Sy mposium on Anaphy laxis (Sampson et al , 2006)
(Appendix H). The Anaphy laxis/Hypersensitivity  Reactions CRF should be initiated in real time 
(along with vital sig n assessment) for events occurring after study  drug administration in the 
clinic or as soon as possible for suspect events outside the clinic. 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
907.1.7.3.2. Creatine Phosphokinase/ Muscular Adverse Events CRF
Potentially  clinically  significant creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations (with or without 
associated s ymptoms) or my algia/muscle s ymptoms will be recorded as an adverse event and 
documented using the potentially  clinicallysignificant CPK/myalgia case report form. A 
potentially  clinically significant CPK is defined as ≥3.1× the upper limit of normal (ULN)
(Grade 3 based on the Food and Drug Administration [ FDA]“Guidance for I ndustry Toxicity 
Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolesc ent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine 
Clinical Trials”).
If a potentiall y clinicall y significant CPK level ( ≥3.1×ULN)occurs, the patient should attend an 
unscheduled visit for a phy sical exam inationand additional testing if indicated per inve stigator 
judgement. CPK levels will be re- tested ataminimum ofevery 7 to 10 day s until the elevation is 
resolved, or if agreed with the medical monitor that no further testing is indicated. For ≥10×
ULN elevations in CPK, repeat CPK level, urinalysis ( including microscopy), serum electrol ytes, 
BUN, and creatinine will be performed as soon as possible after receipt of the CPK result. 
Further testing of CPK levels should be undertaken as frequently  as needed to manage patient 
care per investigator judgmen t, but should be at a minimum ofevery 7 to 10 days as above. Need 
for repeat urinal ysis, serum electrol ytes, BUN,and creatinine testing should be determined by  
the investigator. In addition, need for treatment (eg, administration of iv fluids andurine 
alkalinization) should be considered b y the investigator. 
In cases deemed b y the investigator to be treatment -related elevations in CPK ≥10×ULN (eg, 
potentially  rhabdom yolysis), study drug discontinuation should occur at least until CPK 
normalization or longer based on investigator clinical assessment.
7.1.8. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event
Any patient who experiences an adver se event may be withdrawn from thestudy or from study  
treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator . If a patient is w ithdrawn wholl y or in 
part because of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF 
will be completed at that time . 
The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has 
resolved or s tabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  procedure is made). The 
investigator must inform the clinical project ph ysician (CPP)/clinical lead er as soon as possible 
of all patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events . Additional reports 
must be provided when requested.
If a patient is withdrawn from the study or study drug for multiple reasons that include adverse 
events, the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an 
adverse event . An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that, 
in the opinion of the investigator ,is not severe enough to warra nt discontinuation but requires the 
use of a prohibited medication, thereb y requiring discontinuation of the patient . In such a case, 
the reason for discontinuation would be need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse 
event.
If possible, a blood sample for measurement of serum reslizumab concentrations will be obtained 
from patients experiencing an adverse event leading to withdrawal, a serious adverse event, an 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
91observation of an y severe hypersensitivity  reaction (eg, anaph ylaxis), or an exacerbat ion of 
asthma sy mptoms.
Withdrawal from the study  due to worsening of asthma or a CAEwill be considered a 
withdrawal due to lack of effect, not a withdrawal due to an adverse event .
A patient should only  be designated as lost to follow -up if the site is u nable to establish contact 
with the subject after 3 documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e -mail, 
certified letter, etc).
7.1.9. Overdose of Study Drug
Any dose of study  drug (whether the investigational product, reference therapy , or a placebo), 
whether taken intentionally  or unintentionall y, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately 
reported to the sponsor. When the identification of the study  drug must be known, the 
investigator must follow the procedures outlined inSection 3.10.
Medication errors will be captured as protocol violations or deviations depending on the error.
7.1.10. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , departures from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis . After stabilization and/or treatmen t hasbeen 
administered to ensure patient safet y, the investigator or other ph ysician in atte ndance must 
contact the medical monitor as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in 
consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in 
the study.
7.2. Pregnancy
All pregnancies that occur duri ng the study, or within 5months after last I P injection , are to be 
reported immediatel y to the medical monitor , and the investigator must provide the Teva Global
Pharmacovigilance Department with the pregnancy  form.The process for reporting a pregnancy  
is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section 7.1.6.3). 
Any patient becoming pregnant during the study  will be withdrawn. Allpatientswho become 
pregnant will be monitored to the completion or termination of the pregnancy . If the pregnancy  
continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including spontaneous 
or voluntary  termination, details of birth , and presence or absence of an y birth defect, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor . Any 
complication of pregnancy during the study  and any complication of pregnancy  that the 
investigator becomes aware of after termination from the study will be reported as an adverse 
event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.
If the pregnancy  does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken:
For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious a dverse event .
For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
92For an elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy  
form; do not report as an adverse event .
7.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory test results outside the reference range will be interpreted by  the 
investigator as belonging to 1 of the following categories:
abnormal but not a clinically  significant worsening
abnormal and a clinicall y significant worsenin g
A laboratory  test result that has significantly  worsened (according to medical judgment) from the 
baseline result will be recorded on the source documentation, transcribed onto the CRF as an 
adverse event, and monitored as described in Section7.1.2.An adverse event includes a 
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormality  (once confirmed by  repeat testing) that results in the 
withdrawal of the patient from the study , the temporary  or permanent cessation of treatment with 
study drug, or medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up.
In addition, potentially  clinically  significant values will be predefined by  the sponsor for selected 
laboratory  paramete rs (see Section 9.7.2) and will be detailed in the statistical anal ysis plan.
Clinical laboratory  tests (serum chemistry and hematology ) will be perf ormed at the time points

7.4. Vital Signs
Vital signs (pul se, blood pressure, bod y temperature, and respiratory rate) will be measured at 
time points specified in Table5and beforeother assessments (eg ,blooddraw and pulmonary  
function testing) and study drug administration. Vital signs include the following:
pulse
blood pressure
body temperature
respiratory  rate
Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supine or 
semi-erect/seated position and resting for at least 5minutes. The same position and arm should 
be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient. For an y abnormal vital sign 
finding, the measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any vital sign value that is 
judged by the investigator as a clinically significant change (worsening) from a baseline value 
will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2.
In addition, potentially  clinically  significant values will be predefined by  the sponsor for selected 
vital parameters and will be detaile d in the statistical anal ysis plan. 
7.5. Electrocardiography
A 12-lead ECG will be conducted at screening and week 24 . ECGsshould be obtained before
other assessments (eg ,blood draw and pulmonary function testing) and study  drug 
administration. Standard ECGs parameters will be recorded using a centralized process and the 
ECG will be interpreted locally  by the principal investigator (or qualified phy sician) as normal or 
abnormal. If the ECG is read as abnormal, the principal investigator will indi cate whether or not 
the abnormality  is clinically  significant (y es or no) and write in the detailed 
interpretation/diagnosis. Clinically  significant abnormal ECG findings at screening should be 
recorded as part of the medical history . Any ECG finding that is judged by  the investigator as a 
clinically significant change compared with a screening 
value will be considered an adverse

study number, randomization number, period, and nominal visit. Blood samples will be left 
standing upright at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) to clot for approximately  30to 60 minutes. 
Samples should then be centrifuged at a minimum of 1500g for approximately  10minutes at 4°C 
until clot and serum are well separated. If a 4°Ccentrifuge is not available, s amples may  be 
centrifuged at ambient temperature at 1500g for 10 minutes as long as measures are taken as 
appropriate to prevent samples from heating significantly du ring centrifugation. Separated serum 
will be transferred in approximately  equal portions into 2 opaque, labeled, cry otubes (Aliquot sA 
and B), immediately  frozen in an upright position at a temperature within the range of –60°C to –
90°C, and stored under t hese conditions until they are shipped to the bioanaly tical facilit y. 
Storage at –15°Cto–25°C is acceptable for a period of up to 60 days if a freezer with a 
temperature of –65°C or lower is not available. The listed temperatures must be maintained. 
Labels for samples should include study  number, randomization number, period, nominal visit ,

This section describes the statistical anal ysis as foreseen at the time of planning the study . 
Changes, additions, and further details about the analy ses will be described in the statistical 
analysis plan. After finalization of the statistical analy sisplan, any additional analy ses or 
changes to analy ses that may  be required will be fully  disclosed in the clinical study report.
9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The primary  efficacy variable and endpoint for this study  is the percent reduction in the daily 
OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24 as compared with the dose at the end of the optimization phase.
The study  will be considered positive if the measure meets statistical significance at the 
respective predefined significance level. A statistically  significant effect of reslizumab over 
placebo, as measured b y the primary  efficacy variable, is required to establish the efficacy  of 
reslizumab treatment.
The sample size was calculated based on the following assumptions:
Categorical reduction in OCS dose after 24 weeks of treatment will have the 
following distribution for the placebo group (based on Bel et al 2014 ): 
10.9% percent of subjects will have 90% to 100% reduction
7.9% percent of subjects will have 75% to <90% reduction
14.8% percent of subjects will have 50% to <75% reduction
10.8% percent of subjects will have 0% to <50% reduction
55.6% percent of subjects will have no reduction, loss of asthma control, or 
discontinuation from study  drug
The overall oddsratio between reslizu mab and placebo based on proportional odds 
model will be 2.63
Alpha level of 0.05
Based on the above assumptions, a sample size of 76 subjects per group will provide 90% power 
to detect a significant effect of reslizumab over placebo on the probability  fora higher 
categorical reduction of OCS dose.

Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
1049.5.5. Target Biomarker Endpoint
The target biomarker endpoints are the blood eosinophil counts at DoR/baseline; weeks 4, 8, 12,
16, 20, 24 or earl y withdrawal ; and at the follow -up visit (approximately  week 32).
9.5.6. Planned Method of Analysis
The ITT analysis set(seeSection9.2.1)will be used for all efficacy  analysesunless otherwise 
noted. Summaries will be presented b y treatment group .The per-protocol analy sis set will be 
used as sensitivity  analysis for the primary  analysis.
9.5.6.1.
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary  endpoint is the categorical reduction in OCS dose during weeks 20 to 24, compared 
with DoR/baseline dose, without loss of asthma control . Five categories of reduction will be 
defined: 90% to 100% reduction, 75% to <90% reduction, 50% to <75% reduction, >0% to 
<50% reduction, and no decrease in OCS dose/loss of asthma contro l/discontinuation from study  
drug. This categorical endpoint will be analy zed using proportional odds model. The model will 
include the treatment group and randomization stratification factors as model factors and the 
OCS baseline dose and duration of historical OCS use (ie, beforescreening )as covariates. The 
overall odds ratio between resli zumab and placebo and its 95% confidence intervalwill be 
estimated.
For the primary  analysis, patients who discontinue the study drug early will be considered as 
nonresponders and will be categorized in the lowest category  of response.
If a patient elects to withdraw (or is discontinued from treatment b y the investigator), every  
attempt will be made to continue the assessments subsequent to his/her withdrawal from the 
study(see Section 4.5).
9.5.6.2. Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity  analysis will include data collected after earl y discontinuation from study  drug.In this 
analysis, patients will be categorized according to the percent do se reduction at 24 weeks 
regardless of whether they withdrew earl y from treatment or complete treatment. For patients 
who withdraw early, and forwhom the sponsor fails to retrieve data after withdrawal despite all 
attempts to contact the patients , multiple imputation will be performed to determine the 
categorization according to the percent dose reduction at 24 weeks . Multiple imputations will use 
the postwithdrawal data observed for patients who withdraw early and for which the sponsor 
succeeded to retrieve the data. The methodology  and algorithm to be used for imputations will be 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan.
Other sensitivity analyses will include the following:
Repeating the primary  analysis on the PP analysis set
“Tipping point” 
multiple imputation analy sis to assess deviations from missing at 
random (MAR ); details regarding this anal ysis will be provided in the SAP

Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
105Additional sensitivity  analyses may be included and will be detailed in the statistical analy sis 
plan.
9.5.6.3. Secondary Efficacy Analysis
All efficacy  variables will be summarized by  treatment group. For continuous variables, the 
summary statistics will include n, mean, SD, SE, median, minimum, and maximum. For 
categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be p rovided.
The proportion of patients achieving ≥50% reduction in OCS dose at weeks 20 to 24 while 
maintaining asthma control, proportion of patients achieving dose reduction to ≤5 mg daily  dose 
at weeks 20 to 24 while maintaining asthma control, proportion of patients achieving less than 5 
mgdecrement in OCS dose (ie, the minimal and non -responders) at weeks 20 to 24 while 
maintaining asthma control, and proportion of patients discontinuing OCS at weeks20 to24will 
be analyzed using a logistic regression model.The model will include the treatment group and 
randomization stratification factors as model factors and the OCS baseline dose and duration of 
historical OCS use (ie, beforescreening )as covariates . 
For the secondary  analysis, patients who discontinue the study  drug early  will be considered as 
nonresponders and will be categorized in the lowest category  of response
Analysis of the meanpercentage changefrom baseline in OCS dose at weeks 20 to 24willuse an 
analysis of covariance model with treatment group and stratification f actorsas model factors and 
the OCS baseline dose and duration of historical OCS use (ie, beforescreening )as covariates . 
The frequency  of CAEs will use the negative binomial (NB) regression model. The primary  NB 
model will include the treatment group and randomization stratification factors as model factors 
and an offset variable. The offset variable will be calculated as the logarithm of follow -up 
duration minus the summed duration of exacerbations. The ratio of CAE rate between the 
treatment groups and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated from the NB model.
Additional covariates or factors may  be added to the statistical models. These will be detailed in 
the statistical analy sis plan.
9.5.6.4. Other Efficacy Analysis
Statistical modeling to be used for other efficacy  endpoints will be described and detailed in the 
statistical analysis plan.

Statistical modeling to be used for exploratory  efficacy endpoints will be described and detailed 
in the statistical analysis plan.
9.6. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity
A fixed sequence multiple testing procedure will be implemented to test the primary  and
secondary  variables while controlling the overall t ype I error rate at 0.05. If the resulting 2-sided 
p-value from the primary comparison is ≤0.05, then the next comparison of interest (first 
secondary  variable) will be interpreted inferentially  at 0.05.This process continues through the 
secondary variables either until all comparisons of interest are interpreted inferentiall y oruntil 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
106the point at which the resulting 2-sided p-value for a comparison of interest is >0.05. At the point 
where p>0.05, no fu rther comparisons will be interpreted inferentiall y. The hierarch y of
endpoints is as defined in Section9.5.2.
No multiplicity  adjustments will be made for other efficacy  and exploratory  efficacy analyses.
9.7. Safety Endpoint s and Analysis
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety  analysis set.
9.7.1. Safety Endpoints
Safety measures and time points are provided in Section 3.8and Table5.The overall safet y of 
reslizumab treatment will be assessed throughout the study  by evaluating adverse events and the 
following additional safety  variables.

as appropriate . 
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) . Each patient will be counted only  once in each prefer red term or sy stem organ class 
category for the anal yses of safet y. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events starting 
after first study  drug administration (overall and by severit y), adverse events determined b y the 
investigator to be related to study  treatment (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section7.1.4,with 
missing relationship will be counted as rel ated) (overall and b y severity), serious adverse events, 
adverse events causing discontinuation from study treatment, adverse events with onset during 
the follow- up period (ie, after the cessation of study  treatment), and adverse events that begin 
within 24 hours after injection . Summaries will be presented b y treatment group and for all 
patients. Patient listings of adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to 
discontinuation will be presented and will include all adverse events r eported (including before 
first study  drug administration).

10911. QUALITY  CONTROL  AND QUALITY  ASSURANCE
11.1. Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations
11.1.1. Protocol Amendments
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by  the IEC/IRB and local competent 
authorities as applicable , except when necessary  to address immediate safety  concerns to the 
patients or when the change involves onl y logistics or administration . Eachinvestigator and the 
sponsor will sign the protocol amendment . 
11.1.2. Protocol Violations
A protocol deviation is any  change, diverge nce, or departure from the study  design or procedures 
defined in the protocol.
Important protocol deviations, referred to as protocol violations, are a subset of protocol 
deviations that may  significantly  affect the completeness, accuracy , and/or reliability  of the stud y 
data or that may  significantly  affect a patient's rights, safety , or well-being. Protocol violations 
include enrolling patients in violation of key  eligibility  criteria designed to ensure a specific 
patient population; failing to collect da ta necessary  to interpret primary  endpoints; 
noncompliance to study drug administration; use of prohibited medications; or any  other 
deviations that may  have an impact on the processes put in place for the care and safet y of the 
patients or compromise the scientific value of the study.
Protocol violations will be identified and recorded by  investigational center personnel on the 
CRF. All protocol violations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required.
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to withdraw the 
patient from the study  or permit the patient to continue in the study , with a documented decision
from the Sponsor’s medical representative. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety  of 
the patient andpreserving the integrit y of the study.
Deviations from the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectively  granted by  
the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
eligibility  criteria was entered into a stud y, they must immediately  inform the sponsor. If such 
patient has alread y completed the study or has withdrawn earl y, no action will be taken, but the 
incidentwill be recorded. If such patient is still participating in the study , a determination will be 
made by the sponsor and the investigator as to whether it is in the best interest of the patient to 
continue in the study .
11.2. Information to Study Personnel
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study  to all staf f members 
involved in the study  or in any  element of patient management, both before starting the study  and 
during the course of the study  (eg, when new staff become involved) . The investigator must 
assure that all stud y staff members are qualified b y education, experience, and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities. These study  staff members must be listed on the 
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
110investigational center authorization form, which includes a clear description of each staff 
member’s responsibilities . This list mus t be updated throughout the study , as necessary .
The study  monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study  staff, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring they  comply with the protocol . Additional information will be 
made available duri ng the study  when new staff become involved in the study  and as otherwise 
agreed upon with either the investigator or the study  monitor.
11.3. Study Monitoring
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study  monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the ICFand the study  is conducted according to applicable 
SOPs, the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines.
The study  monitor is the primary  association between the sponsor and the investigator . The main 
responsibilities of the study  monitor are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctl y and completely  recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they  
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with 
IEC/IRBapprovals.
The study  monitorwill contact eachinvestigator and visit the investigational center at regular 
intervals throughout the study . The study monitor will be permitted to check and verify the 
various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, to include specific electronic 
source documentation [see Section3.15) relating to the study  to verify adherence to the protocol 
and to ensure the completeness, consistency , and accuracy  of the data being recorded. If 
electronic CRFs are used for the stud y, the study monitor will indicate verification by 
electronically  applying source document verification (SDV) flags to the CRF and will ensure that 
all required electronic signatures are being implemented accordingl y.
As part of the supervision of study  progress, other sponsor personnel may , on request, 
accompan y the study  monitor on visits to the investigational center . Each investigator and 
assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the study  monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or 
possible misunder standings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring 
visits and/or provided in follow- up written communication.
11.4. Clinical Product Complaints
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the phy sical 
quality or characteristics of clinical drug supplies and/or clinical device supplies used in a 
clinical research stud y sponsored b y Teva. Examples of a product complaint include but are not 
limited to the following: 
suspected contamination
questionable st ability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc.)
defective components
missing or extra units (eg, primary  container is received at the site with more or less 
than the designated number of units inside)
Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
111incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels
unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor or both
device not working correctly  or appears defective in some manner
Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by completing the Product Complaint Form provided by  Teva and emailing it to 
 within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue.
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or 
item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving a drug product, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply ) 
should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 
11.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed F rom the Investigational Center
In the event that the Product Complaint Form cannot be completed, the investigator will obtain 
the following information, as available:
investigational center number and principal investigato r name
name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint 
clinical protocol number
patient identifier (patient study  number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable
product name and strength for open -label studies
patient number, bottle , and kit numbers (if applicable) for double -blind or open -label 
studies
product available for return Yes/No
product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No
description or nature of complaint
associated serious adverse event Yes/No
clinical suppliesunblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No
date and name of person receiving the complaint 
Note: Reporting a complaint must not be delay ed because not all the required information can be 
immediately  obtained. Known information must be immediately  reported. T he sponsor will 
collaborate with the investigator to obtain an y outstanding information.
11.4.2. Handling the Study Drug at the Investigational Center
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigato r’s clinical study  supplies. The sponsor may  request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the clinical study  monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the stud y drug.

Placebo-Controlled Study–Asthma
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 02 Study C38072-AS-30027
112If it is determined that the investigational center must return all of the study drug, the sponsor 
will provide the information needed to handle the return.
The integrity  of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality  
problem existing bey ond the scope of the complaint may  be a reason to unblind the clinical 
supplies for an affected patient.
11.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint
If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event, the protocol should be followed.
11.4.4. Documenting a Product Complaint
The investigator will record a description of the product complaint in the source documentation 
as well as an y actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety  of the patient. 
Once the complaint has been investigated b y the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary , an 
event closure letter may  be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to 
all investigational centers using the product.
11.5. Audit and Inspection
The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study  conduct and compliance with 
protocols, SOPs, GCPs, and applicable regulatory  requirements. The sponsor Global Clinical 
Quality Assurance department , independent of t he Global Clinical Development department , is 
responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit.
Theinvestigator must accept that regulatory  authorities and sponsor representatives may  conduct 
inspections to verify  compliance with GCP guidelines.

13.1. Data Collection
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically  designed for this study . The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21 CFR part 11. The CDMS will be fully  validated to ensure 
that it meets the scientific, regulatory , and logistical requirements of the study  before it is used to 
capture data from this study . Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the 
system and any  study-specific training . After they are trained, users will be provided with 
individual sy stem access rights.
Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriatel y designated and trained 
personnel, and CRFs must be completed for eac h patient w ho provided informed consent
according to the data source . Patient identity  should not be discernible from the data provided on 
the CRF. Data will be verified using the data source b y the stud y monitor, and reviewed for 
consistency  by Data Management using both automated logical checks and manual review . All 
data collected will be approved b y the investigator at the investigational center . This approval 
acknowledges the investigator’s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and 
accurate. 
With regard to data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory , bioanaly tical 
laboratory , central image center, eDiary data),the results will be sent to the investigational 
center, where they  will be retained but not entered into the CR F unless otherwise specified in the 
protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing 
data management) for direct entry  into the clinical database. Laboratory  test results will not be 
entered into the CRF unless otherwise noted in the protocol . All data from other sources will be 
available to the investigators.
For patients who enter a study  but do not meet screening criteria, at a minimum, data for screen 
failure reason, demography, and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be 
entered into the CRF . 
13.2. Data Quality Control
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency  of the data from this study . Data handling, including data quality  assurance, will 
comply with international regulatory  guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines . Data

determined. The patient’s previous OCS will be 
standardized to an equivalent dose and regimen 
of prednisone to the nearest 2.5 mg dailyfor 
oncedaily regimens or 5 mg for every other
day regimens . The patient’s previous non -OCS

will record asthma symptoms, number of 
reliever bronchodilator inhalations, nighttime 
awakenings due to asthma requiring rescue

New Text Infections
The immune response to parasitic 
infections may involve eosinophils; 
therefore, the clinical course of existing or 
new parasitic infections could potentially 
be complicated by a mechanism of action 
that lowers blood and tissue eosinophils.

studies were conducted in geographic 
regions in which helminth infections are 
prevalent, including South and Cent ral 
America, Africa, and Asia. There w ere no 
helminth infections reported, and no 
difference was documented betw een the 
treatment groups in regards to adverse 
events that could be associated w ith 
gastrointestinal helminth infections. 
The overall rate of infection adverse events 
was lower for reslizumab versus 
placebo-treated patients, with the types of 
infection events reported consistent with 
what would be expected in a primarily 
adult patient population with an underlying 
condition of asthma. No potenti al

adverse drug reaction (ADR). All cases of 
anaphylaxis early in the drug development 
plan occurred in the eosinophilic 
esophagitis studies and were deemed 
related to known food allergies by the 
investigator and not to reslizumab . 
Threeinfusion-related reactions, reported 
as anaphylaxis, occurred during or shortly 
after reslizumab infusion in the BREATH 
studies and were characterized variously 
by skin or mucosal involvement, dyspnea, 
wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and 
chills. The 3 events were treated at the 
study site, and patients were withdrawn
from the study. 
Myalgia (without evidence for muscle 
injury) was reported at a slightly higher

Section 1.4.3: Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for This Study:
The majority of adverse events in reslizumab -
treated patients wasweremild to moderate in 
severity,;wasconsidered to be unrelated to 
study drug treatment, as determined by the 
investigator ,;and, (as expected) wasassociated 
with underlying asthma diseas e. There w ere no 
significant differences in the adverse event 
profile betw een patients treated w ith reslizumab 
and patients treated with placebo, w ith the 
exception of the following ADRs “systemic 
severe reactions (including anaphylaxis) ”
and “myalgia”.3Threeofanaphylaxis 
reactions related to reslizumab infusions that
were reported during the BREATH asthma 
program.;Nnone of the sepatients were 
positive for ADA. All cases resolved with 
standard treatment, and treatment with 
reslizumab was permanently di scontinued. This 
is an expected ADR and is listed in the IB.
Myalgia (without evidence for m uscle injury) 
was reported at a slightly higher rate in the 
reslizumab 3.0 -mg/kg group (1%) than in 
the placebo group (0.5%). The protocol 
includes measures to clos ely monitor and 
promptly address these ADRs, to m itigate 
any potential harm  to patients.
Overall, the nature and occurrence of the 
reported study drug related adverse events did 
not raise any specific safety concerns. For the 
full ADR list, please refer to the IB.The majority of adverse events in 
reslizumab -treated patients were mild to 
moderate in severity; considered to be 
unrelated to study drug treatment, as 
determined by the investigator; and, (as 
expected)associated w ith underlying 
asthma disease. T here were no significant 
differences in the adverse event profile 
between patients treated w ith reslizumab 
and patients treated with placebo, w ith the 
exception of the following ADRs 
“systemic severe reactions (including 
anaphylaxis)” and “myalgia”. Three 
anaphylaxis reactions related to reslizumab 
infusions were reported during the 
BREATH asthma program; none of the 
patients were positive for ADA . All cases 
resolved with standard treatment, and 
treatment with reslizumab was 
permanently discontinued. Myalgi a 
(without evidence for muscle injury) was 
reported at a slightly higher rate in the 
reslizumab 3.0 -mg/kg group (1%) than in

voluntarily discontinue study treatm ent (ie, 
refuse study treatm ent but continue with 
study participation) or com pletely withdraw  
from the study (ie, with no further study

investigator decide to withdraw the patient, all 
efforts will be made to complete and report all 
observations up to the time of withdrawal. A 
complete final evaluation at the time of the

explanation should be given as to why the 
patient is withdrawing or being withdrawn from 
the study.
The reason for and date of discontinuation from 
the study drug and the reasons for and date of 
withdrawal from the study must be recorded on

4.5.1Discontinuation of Study Treatm ent
If premature discontinuation of study 
treatment occurs for any reason, the patient 
should continue attending remaining study 
visits while off study treatm ent. The patient 
will continue to receive study provided OCS 
(prednisone) treatment for the rem ainder of 
their participation in the study. The patient 
should not be considered withdrawn from  
the study due to interruption or 
discontinu ation ofstudy treatm ent. For this 
study, it is very im portant to continue 
collecting data from  all patients whether or 
not they complete treatm ent.
If premature discontinuation of study 
treatment occurs, the patient should return 
to the clinic as soon as possible for a study 
treatment discontinuation visit. All protocol -
specified evaluations should be performed atas 
specified in the protocol for the early
terminationwithdrawal visit (see Table5).
The investigator must determine the reason 
for and the date of discontinuation of study 
treatment and record this inform ation in 
both the source documentation and the

the patient to continue attending study visits 
according to the study visit schedule with all 
assessments completed up to week 24(visit

week 24(visit 19) are the priority 
assessments for patients that prem aturely

withdraw from  the study, every effort should 
be made to com plete and report the 
observations outlined in Section 4.5.1

withdrawal. A complete final evaluation at 
the time of the patient’s withdrawal should 
be made, including an explanation of why 
the patient is withdrawing from  the study. 
The reason for and date of withdrawal from  
the study must be recorded in the source 
documentation and the Double -Blind 
Treatment Period Completion CRF.
For patients who are lost to follow -up (ie, 
patients whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating 
an intention to withdraw), the investigator 
should make appropriate efforts to re -
establish contact with patient; atte mpts to 
contact the patient should be documented in 
the source documents. If contact has not 
been re-established, efforts should still be 
made to locate the patient and obtain 
information regarding serious adverse 
events, OCS dose , and survival status at t he

Anaphylaxis is highly  likely when any  one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:
a.Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula) AND AT L EAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING :
Respiratory  compromise (eg, dy spnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
peak expiratory  flow [PEF], hypoxemia)
Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated s ymptoms of end -organ dysfunction 
(eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
b.Two or more of the following that occur rapidly  after exposure to a likel y allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):
Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula)
Respiratory  compromise (eg, dy spnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hypoxemia)
Reduced BP or associated sy mptoms (eg, hy potonia [collapse], sy ncope, 
incontinence)
Persistent gastrointestinal sy mptoms (eg, crampy  abdominal pain, vomiting)
c.Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several 
hours):
Infants and children: low sy stolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease 
in systolic BP
Adults: sy stolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline

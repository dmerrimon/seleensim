cytokine  IL-6 to be tested 24 hours after randomization. Secondary 
outcomes include differences in circulating incretin hormone levels , 
differe nces in other pro -inflammatory cytokines including IL -1β and 
TNF-α, change s in intestinal microbial composition  and function  after 
intervention, glycemic control and variability as assessed by capillary 
blood glucose measurements and exogenous insulin dosi ng during the 
intervention period, and clinical outcomes including intensive care unit 
(ICU) and hospital stay and in -hospital mortality.  
Duration  Study participants will be randomized within 48 hours of meeting 
sepsis criteria , undergo a 24 hour interve ntion and data collection 
period,  and will be followed for clinical outcomes . 
Sample Size  72 participants (36 patients in each arm)  
Population  Men and women older than 18 years of age with evidence of sepsis 
admitted to the intensive care unit  with  an ex isting enteral feeding 
tube (or with imminent plans to place one) .   
Regimen  Participants will be randomized to either receive early low level enteral 
infusion of dextrose (intervention) or enteral free water  (placebo 
control) .

4.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
4.1 Background  
 
4.1.1 The clinical problem of sepsis  
 Sepsis , a complex syndrome characterized by an overwhelming inflammatory response to 
infection , affects over 1 million Americans annually  and is associated with substantial health care costs , 
in-hospital mortality or 20 -30%,  and significant long -term functional and neurocognitive deficits in 
survivors .1-4 Exaggerated pro-inflammatory response s early in the course of sepsis have been associated 
with increased organ dysfunction and lower survival .5  
 Despite advances in our understanding of sepsis path ophysiology  including inflammatory 
responses, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulation abnormalities , no specific  therapies targeting the 
underlying mechanisms of sepsis have been successfully developed (ex- anti-IL-1 therapy, activated 
protein C) .6,7 Instead, the therapies that have demonstrated the greatest benefit in survival from sepsis 
have been the early use of b road spectrum antibiotics and resuscitative intravenous fluids. Sepsis 
management guidelines focus primarily on reducing delay to these life -saving therapies and providing 
additional supportive therapies including vasoactive medications and mechanical vent ilation as necessary 
since late implementation is associated with worse outcomes .8-10  
  
4.1.2 Hyperglycemia and inflammation in sepsis  
Approximately 40%  of patien ts in the intensive care unit develop hyperglycemia, and , of those , 
one third do not have pre -existing diabetes.11 The development of hyperglycemia in previously non-
diabetic patients with sepsis  (referred to as stress hyperglycemia)  is associated with in creased organ 
dysfunction and mortality.12-16 Stress hyperglycemia shares many characteristics with diabetes mellitus 
type 2: disrupted glucose homeostasis, impa ired insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and counter -regulatory 
hormone imbalance. Once hyperglycemia develops, it further increases production of pro -inflammatory 
cytokines, suppresses neutrophil activity, and increases leukocyte adhesion and migration.20-22 While 
Page | 8                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/201 9 
    
 initial clinical trials in critically ill patients demonstrated mortality benefits with tight glycemic control 
using intravenous insulin,17 subsequent trials have failed to replicate the same benefits with the use of 
insulin alone.18,19 Better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to hyperglycemia during sepsis 
and newer strategies to prevent its development , as proposed in our study,  rather than respond onc e 
hyperglycemia has occurred are needed to improve patient outcomes.  
 
4.1.3 Nutritional support in sepsis  
The provision of nutrition is a cornerstone of supportive therapy in critically -ill patients , yet 
uncertainty remain s regarding the optimal timing, dose, and route  of administration .23-25 Sepsis represents  
a catabolic stress state and patients are frequently unable to consume  any calories of their own volition 
due to their clinical condition and associated care. Nutritional support in the intensive care unit can be 
provided to septic patients by either the parenteral or enteral route. Recent clinical trials have highlighted 
potential harm with the early initiati on of parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients , and, as such,  current 
guidelines favor the provision of nutrition support via enteral route . The optimal timing and dose of 
enteral nutritional support  during sepsis remains uncertain .26,27  Current guidelines state28: 
 
•  “nutrition support therapy in the form of early enteral nutrition should be initiated within 24 –
48 hours in the critically ill patient ” (Quality of Evidence: Very Low)  
•  “in the setting of hemodynamic compromise or instability, EN should be withheld until the 
patient is fully resuscitated and/or stable. Initiation/re -initiation of EN may be considered with 
caution in patients undergoing withdrawal of vasopressor support. ” (Expert consensus)  
 
Nutrition is provided to septic patients with the goals of preserv ing lean body mass , preventing 
malnutrition, and facilitating recovery. Providing nutrition via enteral route is also believed to maintain 
the integrity of intestinal epithelium, prevent bacterial translocation, and even potentially modulate 
inflammatory responses.28-31 Important ly the benefits of enteral nutrition are  noted at low (so-called 
“trophic” ) levels of support.32 As described in this proposed protocol, the benefits of low-level enteral 
support in the acute phase of sepsis may include  activation of endogenous endocrine pathways to 
regulate glucose metabolis m, modulation of the acute systemic inflammatory response , and preservation 
of the healthy intestinal microbiome . However, clinical evidence for the dose and timing of enteral 
nutrition is limited and guidelines are based largely on studies of low quality or expert consensus. 
Although current guidelines recommend early nutrition , within the first 24 to 48 hours in critically ill 
patients, clinical studies specifically in septic patients are lacking and the effects of early nutrition therapy 
on mechanistic p athways underlying illness and recovery remain unknown.  
Despite the guideline recommendations for early initiation of enteral nutrition, clinical 
observations from the Acute Lung Injury Registry at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital  show more than half of 
septic patients  receive no enteral nutrition within the first 48 hours  perhaps  due the expert consensus 
recommendation to avoid enteral nutrition during periods of hemodynamic compromise. The SCCM 
guidelines base this recommendation in part on the theoretical risk of bowel ischemia , but this is a rare 
clinical condition that occurs in less than 1% of patients  receiving enteral nutrition .33 Furthermore , a 
retrospective prope nsity score based analysis of critically ill patients demonstrated that patients with 
hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors not only tolerated enteral support but had a reduction in 
mortality compared to similar patients who did not receive entera l support.34 The potential benefit of 
enteral nutrition in this retrospective study of critically ill patients highlights the need for further 
prospective clinical  trials to better characterize the effects of early enteral support with a focus on 
understanding underlying  physiology and mechanisms of disease .

 4.1.4 Enteral glucose as an anti -
inflam matory intervention in 
sepsis  
Simple carbohydrates , such 
as dextro se, are readily digested 
and absorbed in the intestinal tract.  
Recent data from our lab suggest 
that low level enteral dextrose 
provision (~10% daily caloric 
requirements) early in the course of 
sepsis  attenuate s the systemic 
inflammatory response  and 
improves glucose disposal in mice . 
In our first set of 
experiments , we used intravascular 
endotoxin (LPS), a component of 
the cell wall of gram negative bacteria, administered to  10 week old C57BL/6J male mice to test the effects 
of intravenous (IV, parentera l) and intragastric (enteral)  dextrose in the acute phase of sepsis.  
Infusion of a low level of IV dextrose in endotoxemic mice significantly impaired glucose tolerance  
compared to  either IV dextrose or LPS alone. Enteral dextrose infusion at an equivalen t level of support, 
however, increase d insulin secretion and preserved  glucose disposal  in endotoxemic mice . Furthermore, 
infusion of early enteral dextrose in endotoxemic mice was associated with improvement in mean arterial 
blood pressure and attenuated the systemic inflammatory response, evidenced by reduced levels of the 
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 by 35-50% (Figure 1) compared to endotoxemic mice receiving saline 
infusion or intravenous ( IV) dextrose .  Similar trends were noted for the pro -inflammat ory cytokines IL-1β 
and TNF-α. Thus, early enteral dextrose infusion in endotoxemic mice had beneficial effects on the 
systemic inflammatory response as well as glucose metabolism.  
In a second set of 
experiments , we examined the 
effects of IV and enteral dextrose in 
a pneumonia model of sepsis. Mice 
were infected with Klebsiella 
pneumonia e and 24 hours after 
septic insult were randomized to 
receive (1) IV dextrose, (2) enteral 
dextrose, or (3) enteral saline. 
Infusion of IV dextrose in septic 
mice was associated with 
hyperglycemia and decreased 
survival . Mice receiving IV dextrose 
exhibited 100% mortality at 36 hr  
whereas 25% of septic mice 
receiving enteral saline survived to  
72 hours . In contrast, in fusion of 
enteral dextrose increased survival 
to ~70% at 72 hours (Figu re 2) . Mice 
receiving enteral dextrose also

 demonstrated improve d systemic inflammation,  blood pressure , and glucose control  compared to mice 
receiving enteral saline .  
Taken together, our data suggest that early enteral dextrose administration at low leve ls of caloric 
support atten uates systemic cytokine release, improves glucose tolerance , improves hemodynamics , and 
prevents mortality  in the acute phase of sepsis  in mice . Consequently, early enteral glucose provision 
could constitute a method to regulate the inflammatory response and metabolic function in patients with 
sepsis . However, this approach has not yet been explored in humans.  
 
4.1.5 Activation of the incretin hormone axis in sepsis  
Improvements in glucose homeostasis with provision of enteral dex trose in our model appear to 
be mediated through the incretin hormone  pathway. The incretin hormone s glucose -dependent 
insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) are secreted by intestinal cells in 
response to enteral administration o f carbohydrates , proteins, and  lipids , and improve glucose disposal 
by increasing insulin secretion and sensitivity and suppressing glucagon activity.35,36 Relevant to our study, 
incretin hormones also demonstrate immunomodulatory effects in addition to effects on glycemic control. 
In animal studies, incretin hormones decrease systemic inflammation and cytokine re lease in chronic 
inflammatory models.37-42 Incretin hormone receptors are present on macrophages in both mice and 
humans43,44 and thus increased incretin release may have direct effects modulating acute inflammation  in 
sepsis . Therapies targeting increased incretin  activ ity, including incretin analogues and inhibitors of the 
dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) protease, are FDA approved and widely used for the treatment of type 2 
diabetes ,36,45,46 and clinical trials have studied the effect of GLP -1 analogues in critically ill patients.47,48  
Our data suggest that  activation of incretin hormone  pathway s plays a vital role in mediating the 
beneficial effects of enteral dextrose  in endotoxe mic mice .49,50 Infusion of low-level continuous enteral 
dextrose in our model increases circulating levels of the incretin hormone  GIP. When incretin signaling  is 
blocked with pharmacologic agents , the beneficial effects of enteral dextrose on glucose tolerance , insulin 
secretion, and inflammation are lost. Blocking GIP , which is released more proximally in the intestine,  
appear s to be more detrimental than blocking GLP -1 in our model . Further supporting the therapeutic 
potential of incretin hormones, exogenous infusions of GLP -1 and GIP were able to rescue glucose 
tolerance, improve insulin release, and decrease inflammation in endotoxemic mice receiving intravenous 
dextrose, the group of mice that had previously demonstrated the worst glucose tolerance. Thus, 
targeting the endogenous incretin hormone pathway in septic patients with the use of enteral dextrose 
infusion may provide a novel means of maintaining euglycemia and modulating the systemic inflammatory 
response  while preventing the hypoglycemia that is of ten associated with exogenous insulin 
administration . 
 
4.1.6 Host -microbiome interactions as a therapeutic target in sepsis  
Recent research has highlighted the importance of understanding the complex interactions 
between the critically  ill host and the end ogenous micro -organisms in the human intestinal tract in the 
development and evolution of sepsis.51,52 The advent of culture -independent techniques for the study of 
microbes with next -generation sequencing  has revealed that humans harbor in their gastrointestinal 
tracts up to ~ 4 trillion bacteria, which collecti vely with viruses and fungi are referred to as the human 
microbiome.53 In healthy individuals, the gastro intestinal microbiome plays important commensal 
homeostatic roles, including nutrient metabolism,  hormone and vitamin biosynthesis , immune respon se 
modulation, preservation of mucosal integrity and colonization resistance against invasive pathogens.54 
Dysbiosis or disruption of a “healthy” gut microbiome is associated with a loss of commensal microbiota 
resulting in increased susceptibility to pathogen s and dysregulated immune responses.55  
Page | 11                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/201 9 
    
 The gut microbiome in sepsis is severely disturbed  by effects of the pathophysiologic processes 
of sepsis (e.g. gut hypop erfusion, endogenous catecholamines, systemic hyperglycemia etc.) but also from 
critical care interventions, including systemic antibiotics, gastric acid suppression , and nutrition delivery 
interruptions.51,52 The dysbiotic gut microbiome is now considered a central orchestrator in sepsis ( gut-
origin sepsis ), bot h in triggering pathogen invasion ( microbial translocation ) and in mediating distal end -
organ damage by inflammatory mediators ( gut-lymph hypothesis ).56,57 Interactions at the interface 
between the intestinal mucosal layer and the indigenous micr obiome result in barrier integrity failure on 
the epithelial side, and in pathogen expa nsion on the micro -organism e nd that dominate their respective 
microbial communities.58 Restoration o f a healthy gut microbiome through early enteral nutrition is  
emerging as an appealing therapeutic goal in sepsis,51,52 but the effects of different types of enteral 
nutrition on the gut microbiome have not been well -defined. Given that  commensal microbiota depend 
on host nutrition for their survival ,59 early enteral dextrose in septic patients may assist may promote 
maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome in sepsis.   
At the same time, dextrose administered in the stomach or duodenum is expected to be 
completely absorbed in the jejunum, and thus, we do not anticipate that our experimental arm 
intervention will have measurable effects in the colonic microbiota. However , little is known about the 
composition and evolution of gastric /proximal intestinal  microbiome  in sepsis , and gastric acid 
suppression and dysmotility from sedatives  are well known to promote bacterial growth in critically -ill 
patients .51 Given that the stomach form s a reservoir for bacterial aspiration in the upper and lower airways 
of critically -ill patients with downstream infectious complications, we will comprehensively examine the 
microbiome profiles of different parts of the upper aerodigestive tract (oral swabs , tracheal aspirates and 
gastric aspirates) to assess for a potential impact of enteral dextrose on host microbial communities. We 
will also examine stool samples or rectal swabs as proxies for the assessment of the colonic microbiome 
to examine its relate dness to the aerodigestive tract microbiota and possible impact of our intervention.  
 
4.2 Significance  
 
4.2.1 The significance of an interventional trial of early enteral dextrose  
Current clinical guidelines suggest the early initiation of enteral tube fe ed formulations within the 
first 24 -48 hours of intensive care unit admission, but evidence is lacking on the physiologic  and 
mechanistic effects of these interventions in the acute phase of sepsis. Results from our animal models 
suggest that early adminis tration of enteral dextrose at low level s has potential benefits on the systemic 
inflammatory response and on glucose metabolism while also providing some caloric support. With  this 
study, we propose an interventional trial to test the effects of early ent eral dextrose on inflammation and 
glycemic control in septic patients. Our study utilizes a low-cost intervention during the most acute phase 
of illness, a time when  most  patients are not receiving any support by the enteral route. Our study will 
provide i mportant information on the effects of early enteral nutrients on inflammatory and endocrine 
pathways as well as on the gut microbiome. Our study has important implications for clinical care. Results 
consistent with our animal models that demonstrate enter al dextrose  improves  inflammation and 
glycemic control in septic patients  would support a larger  interventional trial testing the effect of very 
early enteral nutrition , similar to early antibiotics or resuscitative fluids , in septic patients . Thus,  the 
results of this clinical trial will be vital in informing future studies of the effects of enteral nutrients in 
critically ill patients.

trial to determine the therapeutic effects of early enteral dextrose in critically ill patients admitted with 
sepsis. This trial will have an interventional arm in which participants receive a low level enteral dextrose 
infusion and a placebo control arm in which participants will receive an enteral free water  infusion . The 
primary outcome of this study is the extent of systemic inflammation as determined by circulating levels 
of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL -6 measured at the end of the int ervention . Secondary outcomes 
include measures of glycemic control by capillary blood glucose ; measures of insulin, C -peptide, and the 
incretin hormones glucose -dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1); 
measures of other p ro-inflammatory cytokines including IL -1β and TNF -α; determination of the 
composition and function of the aerodigestive  tract and colonic microbiome ; and clinical measures 
(including incidence of emesis, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, mortali ty).  
5.1 General characteristics  
 
We will include patients 18 years or older diagnosed with sepsis at the time of admission to an 
intensive care unit (ICU) at UPMC Presbyterian , UPMC Montefiore , UPMC Shadyside, or UPMC 
McKeesport  hospitals . Etiology of se psis can include any organ system (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract 
infection, severe soft tissue infection , etc.) as long as the type of infection does not preclude use of the 
gastrointestinal tract for nutrition and medication administration (e.g. peritonit is).  
5.1.1 Inclusion criteria  
1. Adults age d 18 years and older  admitted to an ICU at UPMC Presbyterian , UPMC 
Montefiore , UPMC Shadyside, or UPMC McKeesport . 
2. New presentation of sepsis characterized by a confirmed or suspected infection, with an 
acute increa se from baseline in a modified  Sepsis -Related  Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA)  score of greater than or equal to 2  points  (Appendix 11.1) . If baseline values are 
unknown, baseline SOFA score of 0 will be assumed.  
3. Available enteral access defined by: (1) an existing nasogastric  or orogastric tube, (2) 
plans to place a nasogastric or orogastric  tube, or (3) an existing percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.   
4. Less than 48 hours since meeting criteria for sepsis . 
5. Expected to stay at least 24 hours in th e ICU .  
 
5.1.2  Exclusion Criteria  
1. Pre-existing continuous enteral tube feed  use prior to study entry . 
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis or diabetic hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome.  
3. Previously enrolled in this study within the same hospital admission.  
4. ICU physician req uest to exclude patient based on clinical assessment  or 
contraindication to enteral feeding.  
5.2 Recruitment and screening procedures  
This is a single center RCT with recruitment to be performed in the ICUs  of UPMC Presbyterian , 
UPMC Montefiore , UPMC Shady side, and UPMC McKeesport  hospitals .

 5.2.1  Initial screening (pre -consent):   
The principal investigator s will introduce the study to ICU physicians in the In -Service Session 
before the start of the study and in ongoing staff meetings, grand rounds, and i n any other ICU meetings. 
The study procedures, eligibility criteria, and study window will be explained. With this knowledge, the 
clinicians in the ICU will be able to assist in identify ing potential subjects and communicate this to the 
study team for pos sible enrollment.  
Screening evaluations to determine eligibility will be conducted daily by the study team based on 
chart review of documentation for new patients being admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of 
sepsis/septic shock. Initial assessment will re ly on review of admitting diagnoses as recorded by treating 
physicians, admitting medical documentation, and lab and imaging results to assess possible sources of 
infection , presence or absence of organ dysfunction , and use of invasive mechanical ventilati on. Initial 
screen for inclusion/exclusion will based on chart review. For those individuals meeting criteria for 
enrollment, the subject or his/her  legally authorized representative (LAR) will be contacted by a member 
of the clinical ICU team and offered the opportunity to participate in the clinical trial. This will avoid “cold 
calling” coercion that could occur if direct contact by research team members was the initial method of 
assessing willingness to enroll.  If that agreement is obtained, a member of the research team will 
preliminarily introduce the study to the subject or LAR.  At that time, a member of the study team will 
review other inclusion and exclusion criteria with the LAR to assess  eligibility.   
 
5.2.2 Consent ing process :  
The PI or a design ated physician co-investigator will follow -up the preliminary discussion to 
answer any additional questions and obtain written authorization and consent for participation from 
subjects or their LAR. The investigator or a co -investigator will discuss the na ture of the research study 
and study procedures with the participant or LAR inclusive of the risks and potential benefits of study 
participation. In cases where the LAR is not present in the hospital, the study will be discussed over the 
telephone. If the LAR agrees, the consent form (ICF) will be e -mailed or faxed to the number provided by 
the LAR. No research activities can start before the signed document is received from the LAR. The PI or 
any physician investigator who discussed the study by phone must  sign, date, and time the consent form 
when it is received (date/time of receipt, not the date of discussion).  
Pennsylvania law defines no specific surrogate decision maker for health care. However, if consent 
is obtained from a surrogate decision maker, the basis for establishing his/her identity should be one of 
the following: Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, next of kin, or following lines of sanguinity in 
order of relationship (i.e., court appointed guardian, spouse, natural or adoptive paren t, adult child, adult 
sibling, any other available adult relative related through blood or marriage known and documented to 
have made decisions for the subject in prior health care settings).  
Rights as a research subject will be explained and ample time fo r the participant or LAR to review 
the consent document prior to obtaining written signature of informed consent will be given. After this 
detailed discussion of the study and conclusion of any questions, the study investigator and/or co -
investigator will obtain informed consent with documentation of the consenting process, prior to 
beginning any research activities. All participants and LARs will be informed of their right to withdraw the 
patients from study participation at any time. Additionally, enrolle d patients will have the right to 
withdraw from the study once decision -making capacity is regained if the patients recover quickly from 
their acute illness (e.g. with early liberation from the ventilator while the patient is still in the study).  
After co nsent, the pre -entry procedures include those listed in Section 5.4.2 . Pre -entry 
evaluations must be completed within 12 hours  prior to study entry.  
 
5.2.3 Baseline evaluation and randomization:   
Page | 14                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/201 9 
    
 If pre -entry evaluation is acceptable, the participant will  be enrolled in the study and undergo 
baseline testing include d in Section 5.4.3 . At that point, the participants will be randomized to 
interventional and  placebo  control arms . Enrollment into interventional and placebo arms will be 
stratified at one level  by the presence or absence of pre -existing self -reported diabetes mellitus utilizing 
separate randomization tables. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Investigational Drug Service 
(UPMC -IDS) will be responsible for randomization, blinding, and pr ovid ing the study infusion  at the  
bedside  to the clinical team .  
 
5.2.4 Blinding:  
The UPMC -IDS will dispense investigational infusions that conceal infusion contents with an 
opaque cover , thus t he treating ICU clinicians , nursing staff , and study investig ators  will be blinded to 
group allocation. Group allocation will remain concealed until blinding is broken after final data analysis 
is completed .  
 
5.3 Study treatment  
 
5.3.1 Treatment arms  
At study entry,  the participant  will be randomized into an interv entional arm that will receive an 
enteral dextrose infusion or a control arm that will receive enteral free water placebo .  
 
1a: Enteral dextrose infusion: A standard solution of 50% Dextrose (0.85 kcal/mL) will be initiated 
within 48 hours of meeting seps is criteria and will be infused at 10 mL per hour for 24 hours. For 
a participant that would have an expected daily caloric requirement of 2000 kcal per day, enteral 
dextrose infusion would deliver approximately 20% of the daily caloric need . As a referenc e, the 
enteral tube formulation Jevity 1.2 provides 1.2 kcal/mL  and is often infused at 10 mL per hour 
upon initiation  of enteral tube feeding. T hus the volume and level of delivered calories  in the 
study group will be similar to the amount delivered in lo w level enteral tube feed formulations.  
 
1b. Placebo control : Patients in the placebo control arm will receive enteral free water at a rate 
of 10 mL per hour following randomization to control for the effects of an enteral infusion . 
Although these particip ants will not receive any enteral calories, a  retrospective review of 
critically ill patients admitted to the Acute Lung Injury Registry a t the University of Pittsburgh with 
a patient population similar to the patients we will enroll to this study revealed  that (1) less than 
10% of patients receive any enteral infusions in the first 48 hours of ICU admission, (2) greater 
than 50% of calories are delivered in intravenous infusions rather than the enteral route, and (3) 
total level of caloric support in the a bsence of enteral feeding is approximately 10 -15% of daily 
caloric needs.  
 
5.3.2 Study drug 
 
Dextrose infusion:  50% Dextrose solution will be infused via an oro/nasogastric tube by ICU 
nursing personnel per standard practices. The solution will be prepare d and provided by the IDS 
and wil l be infused at a rate of 10 mL per hour for 24 hr through a standard enteral nutrition pump. 
No additional water flushing will be necessary. Interruption/discontinuation of the infusion will 
be at the discretion of the trea ting physicians . Symptoms/signs of intolerance including  vomiting 
or aspiration  will be considered an adverse event . Gastric residuals will not be checked monitored 
in this study as they are not required per current critical care guidelines .28

5.3.3 Study d uration  
Study treatment will be administered for a total of 24 hrs. Subsequent decisions for type/rate of 
enteral nutrition following the 24hrs will be at the discretion of the medical ICU team.  
 
5.3.4 Study product formulation and storage  
50% Dextrose solution and free water solution will be stored at room temperature in a dry place  
 
5.3.5 Pharmacy  role 
The UPMC -IDS will be responsible for (1) preparation of  50% Dextrose and free water solutions , 
(2) randomization of participants into intervention and placebo groups, and (3) distribution of 
intervention solutions such that clinical team and investigators are blinded to group allocation .

6.0 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES  
 
6.1 Screening  
 
The screening form will be completed by study personnel. Diagnosis of sepsis will be based on 
review of medical c hart by criteria in  5.1.1 .  
 
6.2 Clinical assessment  
 
A clinical assessment will be performed at enrollment by a study physician and subsequently by study 
personnel at designated time  point s, to include review of clinical diagnos es, physical exam findings,  
microbiological, clinical, and physiological and laboratory information.  
 
6.3 Study procedures  
 
6.3.1 Capillary blood glucose measurement  
Blood glucose will be monitored by capillary blood measurement for the 24 hour intervention 
period no less frequentl y than every six hours starting at the time of randomization in both usual care and 
intervention arms. Capillary blood glucose measurements in the ICU are obtained by fingerstick utilizing 
less than 10 microliters of blood and do not require an additional blood draw. Current sepsis guidelines 
recommend preventing hyperglycemia as part of best care practices but variability remains in glycemic 
monitoring among critically ill patients.10 We will ensure blood glucose is checked routinely at least every 
6 hours in patients enrolled in our study. If capillary blood glucoses are already ordered as part of the 
medical care in the ICU, these glucose checks will be utilized f or study purposes. More frequent glycemic 
monitoring may be utilized as part of the care dictated by the medical ICU team and will not disqualify 
patient from the study.  
 
6.3.2 Research blood draws  
Blood will be drawn for plasma and serum  at two time point s (a) at the time of randomization and 
(b) after the completion  of the intervention  period . Approximately 10 mL of blood will be drawn each time 
either by venipuncture or by drawing blood from existing indwelling catheters ( central venous lines or 
arterial  lines) by the patient’s bedside nurse. Blood will be drawn into several tubes including serum, EDTA, 
and BD P 800 collection tubes.  
 
6.3.3 Microbiome sampling  
Aerodigestive and colonic tract samples will be collected as follows  at baseline, at the end of the 
infusion period, and at day 7 :  
 
Oral swabs: A swab will be gently rubbed on the tongue dorsum, the hard palate, the buccal 
mucosa, and the gingiva. Specimens will be secured in a sterile tube and stored in a locked freezer 
until bacterial nucleic acid  extraction procedures.  The procedure will be performed twice in order 
to obtain samples for both bacterial DNA and RNA extractions.  
 
Page | 18                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/201 9 
    
 Tracheal aspirates:  Five to 10 ml of tracheal aspirates will be collected using a sterile catheter 
during endotracheal tu be suctioning if the patient remains on mechanical ventilation for the study 
period. Samples are collected according to standardized protocols by trained respiratory 
therapists. Such samples are typically collected as part of routine clinical care, but are  usually 
discarded. Samples will be transported immediately in wet ice. Sample aliquots are stored at -
80oC in a locked freezer until bacterial nucleic  extraction procedures.  
 
Gastric aspirates:  Ten to 20 ml of gastric aspirates will be collected through t he existing feeding 
tube. A first sample of gastric aspirate will be collected prior to initiation of experimental 
infusions. If no gastric aspirate obtained, then instillation of approximately 20 mL of water 
through the feeding tube will be performed for suctioning an adequate amount of gastric aspirate, 
which will be placed in a sterile specimen cup and then stored at -80oC in a locked freezer until 
bacterial nucleic acid  extraction procedures. At 24  hr, we will obtain a gastric aspirate of 10 -20 
mL, agai n stored in similar fashion. At day 7, we will obtain a similar specimen if a feeding tube is 
still in place and the patient remains in the ICU.  
 
Stool samples:  If stool is available, a portion of the sample will be taken and stored in a sterile 
specimen cup, as above.  
 
Rectal swabs:  A swab will be gently advanced through the anal sphincter in the anal vault and 
gently rubbed on the rectal mucosa. Specimens will be secured in a sterile tube and stored at -
80oC in a locked freezer until bacterial nucleic a cid extraction procedures. The procedure will be 
performed twice in order to obtain samples for both bacterial DNA and RNA extractions.  
 
7.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
 
7.1 Definition of adverse events  
An adverse event will be defined as any unintended and  unfavorable symptom or outcome during 
the 24 hour intervention period .  
 
7.1.1 Vomiting  
Vomiting in study and use of anti -emetic agents in participants will be recorded and incidence will 
be compared in intervention and placebo groups. In the event of eme sis, enteral study infusion will be 
temporarily discontinued  and will be restarted per ICU management guidelines for enteral infusions . 
Gastric residuals will not be monitored in this study.  
 
7.1.2 Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia hyperosmolar syndr ome (HHS)  
The development of either diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome during 
the intervention period of this study will prompt cessation of enteral infusion to allow for the strict control 
of caloric delivery required in the trea tment of these syndromes.  
 
7.1.3 Ischemic bowel  
 Ischemic bowel is a rare and potentially serious complication associated with enteral feeding 
occurring in less than 1% of patients.33 Ischemic bowel presents with intolerance to enteral feedings 
manifested by emesis, abdominal pain, or bloating and is characterized by ischemia or necrosis of the 
intestinal tissue  thought to be related to diversion of blood flow to in testinal blood vessels in response to 
Page | 19                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/201 9 
    
 enteral nutrients during periods of hypotension and shock. By utilizing only dextrose this risk is expected 
to be minimal.  
 
7.2 Reportable s evere adverse events  
 Critically ill septic patients represent a population in  whom life -threatening multi -organ 
dysfunction and a high rate of untoward medical events are commonly seen routinely during their clinical 
course as part of their presenting medical condition. In an effort to document only clinicall y-relevant 
untoward med ical events that have a greater likelihood of being study related, study endpoints ( including 
level of glycemic control, incidence of emesis, incidence of hypotension ) and certain pre -specified 
expected events for critically ill septic patients (see Append ix 11.3) will not be reported as serious adverse 
events  if they occur during the 24-hour  intervention period . Reportable s erious adverse events (defined 
as fatal or immediately life -threatening or those that are permanently disabling) that are unexpected a nd 
are suspected to be related to study interventions will be disclosed within 24 hours to the IRB.    
 
7.3 Monitoring for adverse events  
Participants will be assessed for adverse events by both the study inv estigators and by the treating 
ICU team during 24  hours of study  intervention . Record of adverse events in the usual care and 
intervention arms wil l be made available to the DSMB . 
 
7.4 Indications for study discontinuation  
  
The following indications will be criteria for study discontinuation:  
• Request by  participant . 
• Serious adverse event related to intervention . 
• Medical need to hold further enteral infusions including impending intra -abdominal surgery.  
• Clinical evaluation by either the investigator or ICU physician that continuation of the intervention 
would be unsafe  including blood glucose greater than 500 mg/dL, severe ileus, or development 
of severe abdominal pain or emesis related to study intervention . 
• Discretion of the investigator . 
• Decision by data safety and monitoring board to discontinue enroll ment.  
 
7.5 Protocol adherence  
Participants in both the placebo and intervention group will be assessed to determine the (1) the 
number of interruptions in enteral study infusion and (2) total amount of time that enteral study infusion 
was successfully admi nistered during the 24 hour intervention period.  
 
7.6 Clinical nutrition management  
The clinical ICU team will be encouraged by study investigators to avoid the use of dextrose -
containing intravenous infusions and enteral tube feed formulations during the  24 hour intervention 
period. Study infusions will not be given concomitantly with enteral tube feeds. If enteral tube feeds are 
started during the intervention period, the study infusion will be stopped and the total time the study 
infusion was delivered will be recorded. Research specimens will still be collected for these participants. 
After the 24 hour intervention period, further nutrition support (if any) will be at the discretion of the 
clinical ICU team . 
Page | 20                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/201 9 
    
 7.7 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
The data safety and monitoring plan for this research study will be conducted by a local Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB)  that will be created to review this study . The individuals to be chosen 
for the DSMB will be free from financial and academic con flicts, will not include study investigators, and 
will have the expertise  required  to understand and identify any issues that would arise with the conduct 
of a clinical trial in critically ill patients.  
The DSMB will meet every six months to review: (1) tr ial performance with a focus on recruitment, 
(2) protocol adherence, (3) completeness of data ma nagement, and (4) trial safety.  
 Furthermore, m onthly meetings for the monitoring of individual case review will be conducted by 
the Principal Investigator s and research team with review of the  following items:  recruitment, enrollment, 
retention, all adverse events, unanticipated problems, withdrawals and any breaches of confidentiality. A 
regular review of accrued data will be done to ensure data integrity and v alidity and to ensure that there 
is no change in the risk to benefit ratio of the study. Any serious or unexpected adverse events, 
unexpected problems that involve risk to the participants or others, or breaches of confidentiality will be 
reported to the I nstitute Review Board (IRB) in compliance with IRB Policies and Procedures. Reporting to 
the NIH will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator and the research team.  
All Serious Adverse Event reporting to the IRB will occur within 24 hours of no tification to the 
Principal Investigator and or research team for appropriate action and file reporting  in accordance with 
the IRB’s stated policy for reporting adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event occurs, the 
investigators will re -assess the ris k/benefit ratio of the study and submit any modifications deemed 
necessary to the IRB for approval. At the time of the IRB renewal the PI will submit in writing the 
information about the frequency of the monitoring, the dates that the monthly meetings took  place, a ny 
external factors or relevant information that might have an impact on the safety or ethics of the study, 
and final recommendations  related to the continuation, changing, or termination of the study.  
 
 7.7.1 Required education in the protection  of human research participants  
Most participants are expected to have cognitive impairment at some time during the study given that 
study population was specifically selected to be high risk for delirium and long -term cognitive impairment 
due to sepsis. T his vulnerable population cannot be substituted since these forms of cognitive impairment 
are the focus of our investigation.  
All participants who are enrolled when cognitively impaired will be given the opportunity to consent to 
further participation (or to withdraw) once they regain decision making capacity. Both participants and 
their authorized representatives can choose to withdraw the participant from the study at any time.    
All principal and co -investigators listed on Institutional Review Board -appr oved protocols at University of 
Pittsburgh are required to participate in a course entitled “The Education and Certification  Program in 
Research & Practice Fundamentals (RPF)”. This web -based tutorial is a requirement of the IRB for protocol 
submission.  
The University of Pittsburgh requires registration of all principal and co -investigators on the Pitt 
CITI Access Portal. The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)  is an organization whose goal is 
to develop and distribute high quality, peer  reviewed educational resources for the research investigators . 
CITI training programs have become the de facto standard to meet Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) 
and Human Subjects Research training requirements at most institutions in the U nited Stat es. 
Certifications in Responsible Conduct of Research and Human Subjects Research (either biomedical or 
social/behavioral) are required for individuals conducting research projects involving human subjects.  
Further information on training required at the U niversity of Pittsburgh may be found at  the following 
website:  http://www.rcco.pitt.edu/ResearchTrainingRequirements.htm .

 8.0 DATA MANAGEMENT AND TRACKING  
 
Data collected during th is randomized clinical trial will be stored on an electronic database on the 
password -protected UPMC network. Any printed documents containing relevant data from the clinical 
trial will be stored in a locked cabinet in the office of Dr. Shah in UPMC Montef iore Hospital . Dr. Shah will 
be responsible for monitoring the security and confidentiality of the database and associated protected 
health information including participant name, date of birth, and medical record number on a monthly 
basis. Quality control  for the database will be performed with range checks and inspection of any outlier 
values by Dr. Shah or Dr. McVerry . 
The electronic medical record of participants will be accessed to obtain patient demographics, 
hemodynamic parameters, and laboratory and  imaging results relevant to determining the severity of 
illness. The only individuals who will access identifiable medical record information are those who already 
have (or will have been given) access to the identifiable medical records, granted by the p rivacy office, by 
means of their job responsibilities. Dr. Shah and Dr. McVerry have legitimate access to these medical 
records as part of their clinical responsibilities.  
 
9.0 DATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Sample size and power cal culation  
 
Prior published estimates of cytokine levels in septic patients at 24 hours,61 suggest that 
recruitment of 7 patients in each group will provide 90% powe r to detect a 15% difference in IL -6 with an 
alpha error of 0.05  (Table 9.1 ). However, we will need to consider the risk of unbalanced baseline 
characteristics in our sample and allow for dropouts as well.  Therefore, 36 patients will be enrolled in each 
group, which will provide greater than 90% power to detect 15% difference in IL -6.62 In our septic mouse 
model, early initiation of enteral dextrose reduced levels of IL -6 by a much larger amount (~40%) than we 
are curr ently powering our clinical trial.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9.2 Proposed statistical analysis  
 
Primary statistical anal ysis comparing levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines will be determined by t -test 
(or non -parametric test if indicated) by intention -to-treat analysis. Differences in secondary continuous 
outcome variables between intervention and control groups will be det ermined by t -test or non -
parametric test as appropriate. Differences in dichotomous secondary outcomes (development of Table 9.1: Per Group Estimates for Detecting
